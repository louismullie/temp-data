## Question

acute pustular tonsillitis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about acute pustular tonsillitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the entity and clarifying whether "pustular" reflects exudative tonsillitis or a different pathophysiology. Then, I should verify the etiologic spectrum and how often it is viral versus bacterial. Next, I will review diagnostic strategies, including Centor/FeverPAIN and testing. After that, I need to check first-line treatment, alternatives for penicillin allergy, and duration. I will then consider controversies like corticosteroids and shorter antibiotic courses. Finally, I should assess complications, red flags, and when to consider tonsillectomy, and close with a practical algorithm and stewardship takeaways.

> Let me first confirm the terminology. "Acute pustular tonsillitis" is not a standard nosology; in practice, it corresponds to acute tonsillitis with purulent exudate on the tonsils, which is a hallmark of bacterial disease but can also occur in severe viral infections, so I should be careful not to overcall it as bacterial solely based on appearance [^2e7260b8] [^e13e2550].

> I need to check the etiologic spectrum. Most cases of acute tonsillitis are viral, roughly 70–95%, whereas group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus accounts for about 15–30% in school-aged children and 5–15% in adults; other bacteria like Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis are less common, and atypicals such as Mycoplasma or Chlamydia can occur in pediatrics, so I should avoid anchoring on GAS alone [^2e7260b8] [^5fb81185].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about testing. I should verify the diagnostic approach. Validated clinical scores improve stewardship: Centor (fever, tonsillar exudates, tender anterior cervical nodes, absence of cough) and FeverPAIN (fever, purulence, attend rapidly, inflamed tonsils, no cough/coryza) stratify risk; in children and adolescents, a negative rapid antigen detection test should be backed by culture because of false negatives, whereas in adults with low Centor/FeverPAIN scores, testing is often unnecessary and antibiotics should be avoided [^f998ba26] [^6d22da7c] [^a784bf3d].

> Wait, let me verify first-line therapy. If GAS is confirmed or strongly suspected with a high score, penicillin V remains the drug of choice at 500 mg twice daily or 250 mg four times daily for 10 days in adults; amoxicillin is acceptable, including a once-daily 775 mg ER formulation for patients 12 years and older, and in children amoxicillin 50 mg/kg/day divided twice daily is reasonable; for nonanaphylactic penicillin allergy, a first-generation cephalosporin is preferred, and for anaphylaxis, clindamycin or a macrolide can be used with attention to local resistance patterns [^a75c72f8] [^6451491d] [^6d22da7c] [^dcca719b].

> I should double-check duration. Ten days is the conventional course to maximize eradication, but a randomized noninferiority trial showed penicillin V 800 mg four times daily for 5 days was noninferior to 1000 mg three times daily for 10 days in patients with 3–4 Centor criteria; however, bacteriologic eradication favored the 10-day arm, so I need to weigh adherence and recurrence risk before choosing the shorter course [^2e9eaee5].

> Let me consider corticosteroids carefully. Guidelines conflict: ESCMID suggests considering a single dose of corticosteroid in adults with severe presentations, whereas IDSA and AAFP advise against routine use due to small benefit and potential masking of complications; if used, it should be a single dose in adults with significant odynophagia and airway risk, and avoided in suspected peritonsillar abscess or immunocompromise [^e1343971] [^1ec43621] [^6d22da7c].

> Next, I should review complications and red flags. Suppurative complications include peritonsillar abscess, cervical lymphadenitis, and rare retropharyngeal abscess; nonsuppurative risks include acute rheumatic fever and post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis, though the latter are rare in high-income settings; warning signs include severe unilateral throat pain, trismus, drooling, muffled "hot potato" voice, or progressive airway compromise, which warrant urgent ENT evaluation and imaging if abscess is suspected [^2e7260b8] [^2d54ac5a] [^e13e2550].

> I will now examine when tonsillectomy is indicated. For recurrent infection, the Paradise criteria remain standard: 7 episodes in 1 year, 5 per year for 2 years, or 3 per year for 3 years, with documentation of fever, cervical adenopathy, tonsillar exudate, or positive GAS testing; modifying factors that may lower the threshold include multiple antibiotic allergies/intolerance, PFAPA, or more than one peritonsillar abscess; evidence shows modest reductions in episodes for 1–2 years, with benefits diminishing over time, so shared decision-making is essential [^c3dba18f] [^480f91fe] [^53ea1028].

> But wait, what if the patient is an adult with recurrent disease? I should confirm adult data. The NATTINA randomized trial in adults with recurrent acute tonsillitis showed that immediate tonsillectomy reduced sore throat days by about 50% over 24 months compared with conservative care, with a 19% bleeding risk and no deaths, supporting surgery as clinically and cost-effective in appropriately selected adults [^51579805].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm. In patients with acute tonsillitis and exudate, I should calculate Centor or FeverPAIN; if the score is 0–1, I will provide supportive care and no testing; if 2–3, I will perform RADT and treat only if positive, with culture backup in children if RADT is negative; if 4, I will treat empirically while sending RADT/culture, then de-escalate if results are negative; throughout, I will counsel on analgesia, hydration, and return precautions for airway symptoms or persistent fever beyond 5 days [^f998ba26] [^6d22da7c] [^a784bf3d].

> Hold on, I should verify stewardship pearls. Avoid antibiotics for low-risk presentations, prefer narrow-spectrum agents when indicated, and complete the intended course; in children, maintain a low threshold to culture after a negative RADT; in adults, avoid routine testing when clinical suspicion is low; and remember that most patients improve within 7–10 days regardless of etiology, so expectations should be set accordingly [^6d22da7c] [^a784bf3d] [^e13e2550].

> Finally, I need to ensure I addressed the "pustular" descriptor. The presence of purulent exudate increases the likelihood of GAS but is not pathognomonic; therefore, I should integrate the entire clinical picture and test judiciously rather than treating solely based on appearance, thereby avoiding unnecessary antibiotics and their harms [^2e7260b8] [^f998ba26].

Acute pustular tonsillitis is most often due to **group A streptococcus** [^2e7260b8] and presents with fever, sore throat, dysphagia, and tonsillar exudates [^2d54ac5a]; diagnosis relies on **clinical scoring plus RADT** [^f998ba26], with culture if negative and suspicion remains [^6d22da7c]. First-line treatment is **penicillin or amoxicillin for 10 days** [^a75c72f8]; in penicillin allergy, use a first-generation cephalosporin or clindamycin [^6d22da7c]. Supportive care includes analgesics, hydration, and rest; corticosteroids may be considered for severe pain or airway compromise [^e1343971]. Complications include peritonsillar abscess, rheumatic fever, and glomerulonephritis [^2d54ac5a]; tonsillectomy is reserved for recurrent infections meeting Paradise criteria or for peritonsillar abscess recurrence [^c3dba18f] [^00ee899b].

---

## Etiology and pathophysiology

- **Bacterial etiology**: Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (GABHS) is the most common bacterial cause, accounting for 15–30% of cases in children and 5–15% in adults [^2e7260b8].

- **Viral etiology**: Viral infections are responsible for 70–95% of cases, including Epstein-Barr virus, adenovirus, and influenza virus [^2e7260b8].

- **Pathophysiology**: GABHS invades the tonsillar tissue, triggering a robust inflammatory response, leading to pus formation and exudate on the tonsillar surface [^notfound].

---

## Clinical presentation

Typical symptoms and signs include:

| **Symptoms** | **Signs** |
|-|-|
| - Sudden onset sore throat | - Tonsillar exudates (pus-filled spots) |
| - Fever (often > 38.3°C) | - Tonsillar enlargement and erythema |
| - Dysphagia (difficulty swallowing) | - Tender anterior cervical lymphadenopathy |
| - Odynophagia (painful swallowing) | - Halitosis (bad breath) |
| - Malaise and fatigue | - Soft palate petechiae |
| - Headache | - Scarlatiniform rash (in scarlet fever) |

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

- **Clinical scoring systems**: Centor and McIsaac criteria help assess the likelihood of GABHS infection based on clinical features [^f998ba26].

- **Rapid antigen detection test (RADT)**: High specificity but moderate sensitivity; negative results in children and adolescents should be confirmed with throat culture [^6d22da7c].

- **Throat culture**: Gold standard for confirming GABHS infection, especially in children and adolescents [^a784bf3d].

- **Laboratory tests**: CBC may show leukocytosis; CRP and ESR are nonspecific but may be elevated in bacterial infections [^notfound].

---

## Management

### Medical management

- **Antibiotic therapy**: Penicillin V or amoxicillin are first-line treatments for confirmed or highly suspected GABHS infection [^a75c72f8]. Alternative antibiotics include first-generation cephalosporins (for non-anaphylactic penicillin allergy) and clindamycin or macrolides (for anaphylactic penicillin allergy) [^6d22da7c].

- **Duration of therapy**: Standard duration is 10 days to ensure eradication of GABHS and prevent complications [^a75c72f8].

- **Supportive care**: Analgesics (acetaminophen or ibuprofen), hydration, and rest are essential for symptom relief [^77842d28].

- **Corticosteroids**: May be considered in severe cases with significant pain or airway compromise, but routine use is not recommended [^77d114f8].

---

### Surgical management

Tonsillectomy is **reserved for recurrent infections** that meet Paradise criteria (≥ 7 episodes in 1 year, ≥ 5 episodes per year for 2 years, or ≥ 3 episodes per year for 3 years) [^c3dba18f] or for recurrent peritonsillar abscess [^00ee899b].

---

## Complications

- **Suppurative complications**: Peritonsillar abscess, cervical lymphadenitis, and retropharyngeal abscess [^2d54ac5a].

- **Nonsuppurative complications**: Acute rheumatic fever and acute glomerulonephritis [^2e7260b8].

- **Airway obstruction**: Rare but potentially life-threatening, particularly in children with severe tonsillar enlargement [^d33b76f6].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis is **generally excellent** with appropriate antibiotic therapy and supportive care [^notfound]. Most patients recover within 7–10 days without significant sequelae [^e13e2550]. Recurrent episodes may necessitate further evaluation for underlying immunodeficiency or chronic tonsillar disease [^notfound].

---

Acute pustular tonsillitis is a common infection characterized by pus-filled tonsillar exudates, most often due to GABHS. Accurate diagnosis and appropriate antibiotic therapy are essential to prevent complications and ensure rapid recovery [^2e7260b8].

### Tonsillectomy or adeno-tonsillectomy versus non-surgical treatment for chronic / recurrent acute tonsillitis [^75451ff5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Surgical removal of the tonsils, with or without adenoidectomy (adeno-/tonsillectomy), is a common ENT operation but the indications for surgery are controversial.

Objectives

To determine the effects of tonsillectomy, with and without adenoidectomy, in patients with chronic/recurrent acute tonsillitis.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2008, issue 2), MEDLINE (1966 to 2008), EMBASE (1974 to 2008), bibliographies, and additional sources were searched for published and unpublished trials. The date of the last search was 11 April 2008.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing tonsillectomy, with or without adenoidectomy, with non-surgical treatment in adults and children with chronic/recurrent acute tonsillitis. We included trials which used reduction in the number and severity of tonsillitis and sore throat as main outcome measures.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors applied the inclusion/exclusion criteria independently.

Main Results

This review includes five studies: four undertaken in children (719 participants) and one in adults (70 participants). Good information about the effects of tonsillectomy is only available for children and for effects in the first year following surgery. Children were divided into two subgroups: those who are severely affected (based on specific criteria which are often referred to as the 'Paradise criteria') and those less severely affected. For more severely affected children adeno-/tonsillectomy will avoid three unpredictable episodes of any type of sore throat, including one episode of moderate or severe sore throat in the next year. The cost of this is a predictable episode of pain in the immediate postoperative period. Less severely affected children may never have had another severe sore throat anyway and the chance of them so doing is modestly reduced by adeno-/tonsillectomy. For them, surgery will mean having an average of two rather than three unpredictable episodes of any type of sore throat. The cost of this reduction is one inevitable and predictable episode of postoperative pain. The 'average' patient will have 17 rather than 22 sore throat days but some of these 17 days (between five and seven) will be in the immediate postoperative period. Whilst the concept of the 'average' patient is attractive, in practice, wide variability is likely. One reason why the impact of surgery is so modest, is that many untreated patients get better spontaneously. There is a trade-off for the physician and patient who must weigh up a number of different uncertainties: what proportion of my throat symptoms are attributable to my tonsils, and will I get better without any treatment? Similarly, the potential 'benefit' of surgery must be weighed against the risks of the procedure.

Authors' Conclusions

Adeno-/tonsillectomy is effective in reducing the number of episodes of sore throat and days with sore throats in children, the gain being more marked in those most severely affected. The size of the effect is modest, but there may be a benefit to knowing the precise timing of one episode of pain lasting several days - it occurs immediately after surgery as a direct consequence of it. It is clear that some children get better without any surgery, and that whilst removing the tonsils will always prevent 'tonsillitis', the impact of the procedure on 'sore throats' due to pharyngitis is much less predictable.

### Tonsillectomy or adenotonsillectomy versus non-surgical treatment for chronic / recurrent acute tonsillitis [^53ea1028]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Surgical removal of the tonsils, with or without adenoidectomy (adeno-/tonsillectomy), is a common ENT operation, but the indications for surgery are controversial. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in The Cochrane Library in Issue 3, 1999 and previously updated in 2009.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of tonsillectomy (with and without adenoidectomy) in children and adults with chronic/recurrent acute tonsillitis in reducing the number and severity of episodes of tonsillitis or sore throat.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; ISRCTN and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the most recent search was 30 June 2014.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing tonsillectomy (with or without adenoidectomy) with non-surgical treatment in adults and children with chronic/recurrent acute tonsillitis.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.

Main Results

This review includes seven trials with low to moderate risk of bias: five undertaken in children (987 participants) and two in adults (156 participants). An eighth trial in adults (40 participants) was at high risk of bias and did not provide any data for analysis. Good information about the effectiveness of adeno-/tonsillectomy is only available for the first year following surgery in children and for a shorter period (five to six months) in adults. We combined data from five trials in children; these trials included children who were 'severely affected' (based on the specific 'Paradise' criteria) and less severely affected. Children who had an adeno-/tonsillectomy had an average of three episodes of sore throats (of any severity) in the first postoperative year, compared to 3.6 episodes in the control group; a difference of 0.6 episodes (95% confidence interval (CI) -1 to -0.1; moderate quality evidence). One of the three episodes in the surgical group was the 'predictable' one that occurred in the immediate postoperative period. When we analysed only episodes of moderate/severe sore throat, children who had been more severely affected and had adeno-/tonsillectomy had on average 1.1 episodes of sore throat in the first postoperative year, compared with 1.2 episodes in the control group (low quality evidence). This is not a significant difference but one episode in the surgical group was that occurring immediately after surgery. Less severely affected children had more episodes of moderate/severe sore throat after surgery (1.2 episodes) than in the control group (0.4 episodes: difference 0.8, 95% CI 0.7 to 0.9), but again one episode was the predictable postoperative episode (moderate quality evidence). Data on the number of sore throat days is only available for moderately affected children and is consistent with the data on episodes. In the first year after surgery children undergoing surgery had an average of 18 days of sore throat (of which some - between five and seven on average - will be in the immediate postoperative period), compared with 23 days in the control group (difference 5.1 days, 95% CI 2.2 to 8.1; moderate quality evidence). When we pooled the data from two studies in adults (156 participants), there were 3.6 fewer episodes (95% CI 7.9 fewer to 0.70 more; low quality evidence) in the group receiving surgery within six months post-surgery. However, statistical heterogeneity was significant. The pooled mean difference for number of days with sore throat in a follow-up period of about six months was 10.6 days fewer in favour of the group receiving surgery (95% CI 5.8 fewer to 15.8 fewer; low quality evidence). However, there was also significant statistical heterogeneity in this analysis and the number of days with postoperative pain (which appeared to be on average 13 to 17 days in the two trials) was not included. Given the short duration of follow-up and the differences between studies, we considered the evidence for adults to be of low quality. Two studies in children reported that there was "no statistically significant difference" in quality of life outcomes, but the data could not be pooled. One study reported no difference in analgesics consumption. We found no evidence for prescription of antibiotics. Limited data are available from the included studies to quantify the important risks of primary and secondary haemorrhage.

Authors' Conclusions

Adeno-/tonsillectomy leads to a reduction in the number of episodes of sore throat and days with sore throat in children in the first year after surgery compared to (initial) non-surgical treatment. Children who were more severely affected were more likely to benefit as they had a small reduction in moderate/severe sore throat episodes. The size of the effect is very modest, but there may be a benefit to knowing the precise timing of one episode of pain lasting several days - it occurs immediately after surgery as a direct consequence of the procedure. It is clear that some children get better without any surgery, and that whilst removing the tonsils will always prevent 'tonsillitis', the impact of the procedure on 'sore throats' due to pharyngitis is much less predictable. Insufficient information is available on the effectiveness of adeno-/tonsillectomy versus non-surgical treatment in adults to draw a firm conclusion. The impact of surgery, as demonstrated in the included studies, is modest. Many participants in the non-surgical group improve spontaneously (although some people randomised to this group do in fact undergo surgery). The potential 'benefit' of surgery must be weighed against the risks of the procedure as adeno-/tonsillectomy is associated with a small but significant degree of morbidity in the form of primary and secondary haemorrhage and, even with good analgesia, is particularly uncomfortable for adults.

### Tonsillitis [^3de02903]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2009). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The definition of severe recurrent throat infections is arbitrary, but recent criteria have defined severe tonsillitis as: five or more episodes of true tonsillitis a year; symptoms for at least 1 year; and episodes that are disabling and prevent normal functioning. Diagnosis of acute tonsillitis is clinical, and it can be difficult to distinguish viral from bacterial infections. Rapid antigen testing has a very low sensitivity in the diagnosis of bacterial tonsillitis, but more accurate tests take longer to deliver results. Bacteria are cultured from few people with tonsillitis. Other causes include infectious mononucleosis from Epstein-Barr virus infection, cytomegalovirus, toxoplasmosis, HIV, hepatitis A, and rubella.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of tonsillectomy in children and adults with acute recurrent or chronic throat infections? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to March 2009 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 10 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: cold-steel tonsillectomy and diathermy tonsillectomy.

### Analysis of different recommendations from international guidelines for the management of acute pharyngitis in adults and children [^1f8463e1]. Clinical Therapeutics (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Streptococcal pharyngitis is a frequently observed condition, but its optimal management continues to be debated.

Objective

The goal of this study was to evaluate the available guidelines, developed at the national level, for the management of streptococcal pharyngitis in Western countries, with a focus on their differences.

Methods

A literature search was conducted of the Cochrane Library, EMBASE, TRIP, and MEDLINE databases from their inception (1993 for the Cochrane Library, 1980 for EMBASE, 1997 for TRIP, and 1966 for MEDLINE) through April 25, 2010. The following search terms were used: pharyngitis, sore throat, tonsillitis, pharyngotonsillitis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Group A β-haemolytic Streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcal pharyngitis. Searches were limited to type of article or document (practice guideline or guideline) with no language restrictions or language limits.

Results

Twelve national guidelines were identified: 6 from European countries (France, United Kingdom, Finland, Holland, Scotland, and Belgium), 5 from the United States, and 1 from Canada. Recommendations differ substantially with regard to the use of a rapid antigen diagnostic test or throat culture and the indications for antibiotic treatment. The North American, Finnish, and French guidelines recommend performing one timely microbiologic investigation in suspected cases, and prescribing antibiotics in confirmed cases to prevent suppurative complications and acute rheumatic fever. According to the remaining European guidelines, however, acute sore throat is considered a benign, self-limiting disease. Microbiologic tests are not routinely recommended by these latter guidelines, and antibiotic treatment is reserved for well-selected cases. The use of the Centor score, for evaluation of the risk of streptococcal infection, is recommended by several guidelines, but subsequent decisions on the basis of the results differ in terms of which subjects should undergo microbiologic investigation. All guidelines agree that narrow-spectrum penicillin is the first choice of antibiotic for the treatment of streptococcal pharyngitis and that treatment should last for 10 days to eradicate the microorganism. Once-daily amoxicillin was recommended by 2 US guidelines as equally effective.

Conclusion

The present review found substantial discrepancies in the recommendations for the management of pharyngitis among national guidelines in Europe and North America.

### Tonsillitis and tonsilloliths: diagnosis and management [^2e7260b8]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Tonsillitis, or inflammation of the tonsils, makes up approximately 0.4% of outpatient visits in the United States. Tonsillitis is caused by a viral infection in 70% to 95% of cases. However, bacterial infections caused by group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (Streptococcus pyogenes) account for tonsillitis in 5% to 15% of adults and 15% to 30% of patients five to 15 years of age. It is important to differentiate group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus from other bacterial or viral causes of pharyngitis and tonsillitis because of the risk of progression to more systemic complications such as abscess, acute glomerulonephritis, rheumatic fever, and scarlet fever after infection with group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus. A variety of diagnostic tools are available, including symptom-based validated scoring systems (e.g. Centor score), and oropharyngeal and serum laboratory testing. Treatment is focused on supportive care, and if group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus is identified, penicillin should be used as the first-line antibiotic. In cases of recurrent tonsillitis, watchful waiting is strongly recommended if there have been less than seven episodes in the past year, less than five episodes per year for the past two years, or less than three episodes per year for the past three years. Tonsilloliths, or tonsil stones, are managed expectantly, and small tonsilloliths are common clinical findings. Rarely, surgical intervention is required if they become too large to pass on their own.

### Principles of appropriate antibiotic use for acute pharyngitis in adults: background [^5f3efc37]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The following principles of appropriate antibiotic use for adults with acute pharyngitis apply to immunocompetent adults without complicated comorbid conditions, such as chronic lung or heart disease, and history of rheumatic fever. They do not apply during known outbreaks of group A streptococcus.1. Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (GABHS) is the causal agent in approximately 10% of adult cases of pharyngitis. The large majority of adults with acute pharyngitis have a self-limited illness, for which supportive care only is needed.2. Antibiotic treatment of adult pharyngitis benefits only those patients with GABHS infection. All patients with pharyngitis should be offered appropriate doses of analgesics and antipyretics, as well as other supportive care.3. Limit antibiotic prescriptions to patients who are most likely to have GABHS infection. Clinically screen all adult patients with pharyngitis for the presence of the four Centor criteria: history of fever, tonsillar exudates, no cough, and tender anterior cervical lymphadenopathy (lymphadenitis). Do not test or treat patients with none or only one of these criteria, since these patients are unlikely to have GABHS infection. For patients with two or more criteria the following strategies are appropriate: a) Test patients with two, three, or four criteria by using a rapid antigen test, and limit antibiotic therapy to patients with positive test results; b) test patients with two or three criteria by using a rapid antigen test, and limit antibiotic therapy to patients with positive test results or patients with four criteria; or c) do not use any diagnostic tests, and limit antibiotic therapy to patients with three or four criteria. 4. Throat cultures are not recommended for the routine primary evaluation of adults with pharyngitis or for confirmation of negative results on rapid antigen tests when the test sensitivity exceeds 80%. Throat cultures may be indicated as part of investigations of outbreaks of GABHS disease, for monitoring the development and spread of antibiotic resistance, or when such pathogens as gonococcus are being considered.5. The preferred antibiotic for treatment of acute GABHS pharyngitis is penicillin, or erythromycin in a penicillin-allergic patient.

### Conservative management versus tonsillectomy in adults with recurrent acute tonsillitis in the UK (NATTINA): a multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled trial [^51579805]. Lancet (2023). Excellent credibility.

Background

Tonsillectomy is regularly performed in adults with acute tonsillitis, but with scarce evidence. A reduction in tonsillectomies has coincided with an increase in acute adult hospitalisation for tonsillitis complications. We aimed to assess the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of conservative management versus tonsillectomy in patients with recurrent acute tonsillitis.

Methods

This pragmatic multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled trial was conducted in 27 hospitals in the UK. Participants were adults aged 16 years or older who were newly referred to secondary care otolaryngology clinics with recurrent acute tonsillitis. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive tonsillectomy or conservative management using random permuted blocks of variable length. Stratification by recruiting centre and baseline symptom severity was assessed using the Tonsil Outcome Inventory-14 score (categories defined as mild 0–35, moderate 36–48, or severe 49–70). Participants in the tonsillectomy group received elective surgery to dissect the palatine tonsils within 8 weeks after random assignment and those in the conservative management group received standard non-surgical care during 24 months. The primary outcome was the number of sore throat days collected during 24 months after random assignment, reported once per week with a text message. The primary analysis was done in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population. This study is registered with the ISRCTN registry, 55284102.

Findings

Between May 11, 2015, and April 30, 2018, 4165 participants with recurrent acute tonsillitis were assessed for eligibility and 3712 were excluded. 453 eligible participants were randomly assigned (233 in the immediate tonsillectomy group vs 220 in the conservative management group). 429 (95%) patients were included in the primary ITT analysis (224 vs 205). The median age of participants was 23 years (IQR 19–30), with 355 (78%) females and 97 (21%) males. Most participants were White (407 [90%]). Participants in the immediate tonsillectomy group had fewer days of sore throat during 24 months than those in the conservative management group (median 23 days [IQR 11–46] vs 30 days [14–65]). After adjustment for site and baseline severity, the incident rate ratio of total sore throat days in the immediate tonsillectomy group (n = 224) compared with the conservative management group (n = 205) was 0.53 (95% CI 0.43 to 0.65; < 0.0001). 191 adverse events in 90 (39%) of 231 participants were deemed related to tonsillectomy. The most common adverse event was bleeding (54 events in 44 [19%] participants). No deaths occurred during the study.

Interpretation

Compared with conservative management, immediate tonsillectomy is clinically effective and cost-effective in adults with recurrent acute tonsillitis.

### Pharyngitis management: defining the controversy [^7b50994c]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Despite numerous controlled trials, clinical practice guidelines and cost-effective analyses, controversy persists regarding the appropriate management strategy for adult pharyngitis. In this perspective, we explore this controversy by comparing two competing clinical guidelines. Although the guidelines appear to make widely diverging recommendations, we show that the controversy centers on only a small proportion of patients: those presenting with severe pharyngitis. We examine recently published data to illustrate that this seemingly simple problem of strep throat remains a philosophical issue: should we give primacy to relieving acute time-limited symptoms, or should we emphasize the potential societal risk of antibiotic resistance? We accept potentially over treating a minority of adult pharyngitis patients with the most severe presentations to reduce suffering in an approximately equal number of patients who will have false negative test results if the test-and-treat strategy were used.

### Peritonsillar abscess: complication of acute tonsillitis or Weber's glands infection? [^be0d2bcb]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the literature concerning the 2 primary hypotheses put forth to explain the pathogenesis of peritonsillar abscess: "the acute tonsillitis hypothesis" (peritonsillar abscess is a complication of acute tonsillitis) and "the Weber gland hypothesis" (peritonsillar abscess is an infection of Weber's glands).

Data Sources

PubMed, EMBASE.

Review Methods

Data supporting or negating one hypothesis or the other were elicited from the literature.

Conclusions

Several findings support the acute tonsillitis hypothesis. First, the 2 main pathogens in peritonsillar abscess have been recovered from pus aspirates and bilateral tonsillar tissues with high concordance rates, suggesting that both tonsils are infected in patients with peritonsillar abscess. Second, studies report signs of acute tonsillitis in the days prior to and at the time of peritonsillar abscess. Third, antibiotic treatment reduces the risk of abscess development in patients with acute tonsillitis. However, some findings suggest involvement of the Weber's glands in peritonsillar abscess pathogenesis. First, high amylase levels have been found in peritonsillar pus. Second, the majority of peritonsillar abscesses are located at the superior tonsillar pole in proximity of the Weber's glands. We propose a unified hypothesis whereby bacteria initially infect the tonsillar mucosa and spread via the salivary duct system to the peritonsillar space, where an abscess is formed.

Implications For Practice

Our findings support the rationale for antibiotic treatment of patients with severe acute tonsillitis to reduce the risk of abscess development. Improved understanding of peritonsillar abscess pathogenesis is important for the development of efficient prevention strategies.

### Different antibiotic treatments for group A streptococcal pharyngitis [^7bd28471]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Antibiotics provide only modest benefit in treating sore throat, although their effectiveness increases in people with positive throat swabs for group A beta-haemolytic streptococci (GABHS). It is unclear which antibiotic is the best choice if antibiotics are indicated. This is an update of a review first published in 2010, and updated in 2013, 2016, and 2020.

Objectives

To assess the comparative efficacy of different antibiotics in: (a) alleviating symptoms (pain, fever); (b) shortening the duration of the illness; (c) preventing clinical relapse (i.e. recurrence of symptoms after initial resolution); and (d) preventing complications (suppurative complications, acute rheumatic fever, post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis). To assess the evidence on the comparative incidence of adverse effects and the risk-benefit of antibiotic treatment for streptococcal pharyngitis.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to 3 September 2020: CENTRAL (2020, Issue 8), MEDLINE Ovid (from 1946), Embase Elsevier (from 1974), and Web of Science Thomson Reuters (from 2010). We also searched clinical trial registers on 3 September 2020.

Selection Criteria

Randomised, double-blind trials comparing different antibiotics, and reporting at least one of the following: clinical cure, clinical relapse, or complications and/or adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened trials for inclusion and extracted data using standard methodological procedures as recommended by Cochrane. We assessed the risk of bias of included studies according to the methods outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions, and used the GRADE approach to assess the overall certainty of the evidence for the outcomes. We have reported the intention-to-treat analysis, and also performed an analysis of evaluable participants to explore the robustness of the intention-to-treat results.

Main Results

We included 19 trials reported in 18 publications (5839 randomised participants): six trials compared penicillin with cephalosporins; six compared penicillin with macrolides; three compared penicillin with carbacephem; one compared penicillin with sulphonamides; one compared clindamycin with ampicillin; and one compared azithromycin with amoxicillin in children. All participants had confirmed acute GABHS tonsillopharyngitis, and ages ranged from one month to 80 years. Nine trials included only, or predominantly, children. Most trials were conducted in an outpatient setting. Reporting of randomisation, allocation concealment, and blinding was poor in all trials. We downgraded the certainty of the evidence mainly due to lack of (or poor reporting of) randomisation or blinding, or both; heterogeneity; and wide confidence intervals. Cephalosporins versus penicillin We are uncertain if there is a difference in symptom resolution (at 2 to 15 days) for cephalosporins versus penicillin (odds ratio (OR) for absence of symptom resolution 0.79, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.55 to 1.12; 5 trials; 2018 participants; low-certainty evidence). Results of the sensitivity analysis of evaluable participants differed (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.97; 5 trials; 1660 participants; very low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain if clinical relapse may be lower for cephalosporins compared with penicillin (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.99; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 50; 4 trials; 1386 participants; low-certainty evidence). Very low-certainty evidence showed no difference in reported adverse events. Macrolides versus penicillin We are uncertain if there is a difference between macrolides and penicillin for resolution of symptoms (OR 1.11, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.35; 6 trials; 1728 participants; low-certainty evidence). Sensitivity analysis of evaluable participants resulted in an OR of 0.79, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.09; 6 trials; 1159 participants). We are uncertain if clinical relapse may be different (OR 1.21, 95% CI 0.48 to 3.03; 6 trials; 802 participants; low-certainty evidence). Azithromycin versus amoxicillin Based on one unpublished trial in children, we are uncertain if resolution of symptoms is better with azithromycin in a single dose versus amoxicillin for 10 days (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.05; 1 trial; 673 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Sensitivity analysis for per-protocol analysis resulted in an OR of 0.29, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.73; 1 trial; 482 participants; very low-certainty evidence). We are also uncertain if there was a difference in relapse between groups (OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.82; 1 trial; 422 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Adverse events were more common with azithromycin compared to amoxicillin (OR 2.67, 95% CI 1.78 to 3.99; 1 trial; 673 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Carbacephem versus penicillin There is low-certainty evidence that compared with penicillin, carbacephem may provide better symptom resolution post-treatment in adults and children (OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.99; NNTB 14.3; 3 trials; 795 participants). Studies did not report on long-term complications, so it was unclear if any class of antibiotics was better in preventing serious but rare complications. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We are uncertain if there are clinically relevant differences in symptom resolution when comparing cephalosporins and macrolides with penicillin in the treatment of GABHS tonsillopharyngitis. Low-certainty evidence in children suggests that carbacephem may be more effective than penicillin for symptom resolution. There is insufficient evidence to draw conclusions regarding the other comparisons in this review. Data on complications were too scarce to draw conclusions. These results do not demonstrate that other antibiotics are more effective than penicillin in the treatment of GABHS pharyngitis. All studies were conducted in high-income countries with a low risk of streptococcal complications, so there is a need for trials in low-income countries and Aboriginal communities, where the risk of complications remains high.

### Rational prescribing is important in all settings [^639ba4e7]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2013). Low credibility.

Legislation has been introduced in both Europe and the USA to facilitate clinical trials in paediatric patients of all ages. The legislation is to be welcomed if it results in increased scientific evidence to enable health professionals to use medicines more effectively and safely. This was certainly the aim of the health professionals who highlighted the extent of off-label prescribing in children. It is important to recognise, however, that health professionals have a responsibility to use the scientific evidence that is generated to prescribe medicines in a rational manner.

The evaluation of whether medicines are prescribed rationally unfortunately is difficult. There has been insufficient research on developing validated tools to assess prescribing, especially in children. Quality indicators for outpatient antibiotic prescribing have been developed by the European Surveillance of Antimicrobial Consumption project. The majority of the quality indicators relate to adults, but three relate specifically to children. These three quality indicators suggest that no more than 20% of children seen in a clinic with an acute upper respiratory tract infection, acute tonsillitis or acute otitis media should be prescribed oral (systemic) antibiotics. It is only through the development of drug-specific and disease-specific quality indicators for other medicines that one will be able to ensure children receive the appropriate medicine whenever they see a health professional.

Before prescribing any medicine, doctors should always ask themselves the following questions. First, is there evidence that the medicine is effective in treating the disease that the patient presents with and, additionally, is it effective in the age group of the patient with the disease? Second, do the benefits of treatment outweigh the risks associated with the treatment? We all have a responsibility to our patients to ensure that we use medicines that are both safe and effective, but also that they are used in a rational manner.

### Clinical practice guideline: tonsillectomy in children (update) [^00ee899b]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Statement 3 — tonsillectomy for recurrent infection with modifying factors: Clinicians should assess the child with recurrent throat infection who does not meet criteria in Key Action Statement 2 for modifying factors that may nonetheless favor tonsillectomy, including but not limited to multiple antibiotic allergies/intolerance, PFAPA (periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, and adenitis), or history of > 1 peritonsillar abscess; the recommendation is based on randomized controlled trials and observational studies with a preponderance of benefit over harm.

### The role of tonsillectomy in psoriasis treatment [^32f79e36]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Psoriasis is a chronic and immune-mediated skin disease with a considerable negative impact on quality of life. The link between psoriasis, especially guttate psoriasis, and streptococcal infections, namely tonsillitis, has been studied for several years. Some authors have also suggested an association with other types of psoriasis, such as plaque psoriasis, which is the most common. The role of tonsillectomy in the treatment of plaque psoriasis is not consensual. This case report aims to discuss this topic. The authors intend to highlight the growing evidence of a relationship between plaque psoriasis and an infectious pathology of the otolaryngology area. A clinical case of severe chronic plaque psoriasis with exacerbations linked to acute tonsillitis is described. The case was recalcitrant to dermatological treatment and tonsillectomy was included in the treatment options. After surgery, the skin disease was evidently controlled and significant improvement on the patient's quality of life was also evident.

### Penicillin V four times daily for five days versus three times daily for 10 days in patients with pharyngotonsillitis caused by group A streptococci: randomised controlled, open label, non-inferiority study [^56413fe8]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Sore throat is a common reason for prescribing antibiotics and accounts for about 11% of all antibiotic prescriptions in primary healthcare in Sweden, which is a low prescribing country. Among approximately 29 consultations per 1000 inhabitants for sore throat in 2013, about two thirds were labelled as tonsillitis, of which 80% received an antibiotic prescription. Group A streptococcus is the most common pathogen in acute tonsillitis and is present in about 33% of patients with acute sore throat, but other bacteria and viruses are also potential pathogens. The European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) Sore Throat Guideline Group and Swedish guidelines for the management of sore throat focus on patients who are more likely to benefit from antimicrobial treatment. These patients have a higher symptom burden and an infection caused by group A streptococcus. The recommendation is that antibiotic treatment should be offered to patients with three or four Centor criteria (fever, tender cervical lymph nodes, coatings of the tonsils, and lack of cough) and a positive rapid antigen detection test for group A streptococcus. In Sweden the recommended treatment regimen for adults is 1000 mg penicillin V three times daily for 10 days. This duration of treatment is similar to other countries, but the dosage and total exposure (30 g) are relatively high. The historical reason for antimicrobial treatment is mainly to avoid serious complications such as acute rheumatic fever and glomerulonephritis. These conditions are currently extremely rare in high income countries. Today the main reason for treatment in high income countries is to speed up clinical resolution of symptoms, but treatment also prevents rare complications such as peritonsillitis, impetigo, cellulitis, otitis media, and sinusitis.

### Implementing criteria-led discharge for acute admissions to facilitate the elective recovery from COVID-19: an example in acute tonsillitis [^cc58e4da]. BMJ Open Quality (2023). High credibility.

Background

Healthcare systems face unprecedented numbers of patients waiting for elective treatments in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Hospitals must urgently optimise patient pathways and build capacity to meet the populations health needs. Criteria-led discharge (CLD) is frequently used to optimise elective care pathways but may hold potential in discharging patients at the end of an acute hospital admission.

Methods

We conducted a quality improvement project to design and introduce a novel inpatient pathway using CLD for patients with severe acute tonsillitis. Our analysis compared the standardisation of treatment, length of stay, discharge time and readmission rate between those treated on the novel pathway compared with standard treatment.

Results

The study population included 137 patients admitted to a tertiary centre with acute tonsillitis. Introduction of the tonsillitis pathway using CLD resulted in a significant reduction in median length of stay from 24 hours to 18 hours. Of those treated on the tonsillitis pathway, 52.2% were discharged prior to midday compared with 29.1% who received standard treatment. No patient discharged using CLD required readmission.

Conclusion

CLD is safe and effective at reducing length of stay in patients requiring acute hospital admission for acute tonsillitis. CLD should be used and evaluated in further novel patient pathways across different areas of medicine to optimise care and build capacity for provision of elective healthcare services. Further research is required to investigate safe and optimal criteria which indicate patients are fit for discharge.

### Corticosteroids for sore throat: a clinical practice guideline [^e13e2550]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Acute sore throat is defined as pain in the throat for less than 14 days. Acute sore throat could be caused by pharyngitis, nasopharyngitis, tonsillitis, peritonsillar abscess, or retropharyngeal abscess. Some patients with sore throat also experience headache, fever, muscle stiffness, cough, and general malaise.

Acute sore throat is common, but only a minority of patients will visit their general practitioner. A survey reported that the main reasons are to establish the cause of the symptoms, obtain pain relief, and to gain information on the course of the disease. Data from Dutch and Flemish primary care databases show that, for every 1000 consecutive patients consulting a general practitioner, 50 present with an acute sore throat. In the US, more than 92 million visits by adults to primary care practices and emergency departments between 1997 and 2010 were recorded. Sore throat presenting as acute tonsillitis is also the commonest cause for emergency admission to otorhinolaryngology services in the US.

Acute sore throat is a self limiting disease and typically resolves after 7–10 days in adults and 2–7 days in children. Most infections are of viral origin; only a few are caused by a bacterial infection, of which group A β-haemolytic streptococcus, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis are the most common pathogens. Evidence suggests that the time to resolution is not associated with the type of pathogen. About 2% of patients initially presenting with sore throat will have a mononucleosis infection caused by an Epstein-Barr virus, which could prolong the duration of symptoms.

Some patients experience unacceptable morbidity and inconvenience, and miss school or work due to recurrent sore throat. Pain is a common reason for work or school absence. Complications of sore throat are rare: about 0.2% of patients with tonsillitis will develop a peritonsillar abscess.

### Implementing criteria-led discharge for acute admissions to facilitate the elective recovery from COVID-19: an example in acute tonsillitis [^d3e6aadd]. BMJ Open Quality (2023). High credibility.

Methods

Study design

This study is a quality improvement project. A retrospective practice audit was initially undertaken. The results of the initial practice audit were used to develop a new patient pathway to both standardise treatment for those admitted under otolaryngology (ENT) with acute tonsillitis and introduce CLD.

Setting

The study was completed in a 28-bed surgical ward affiliated with the otolaryngology department at a tertiary NHS hospital. Patients were typically admitted to the ward under otolaryngology following referral from the emergency department and general practitioners. The study was conducted between January and March 2020 and October 2020 and April 2021. The study was suspended between March and October 2020 due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

Population

Eligibility criteria

Diagnosis of acute tonsillitis.
Unable to maintain oral intake for hydration and medication.

Exclusion criteria

Complication of tonsillitis present, for example, peritonsillar abscess.
Alternative diagnosis likely, for example, pharyngitis or supraglottitis.
Evidence of septic shock.

Intervention

All patients who met the eligibility criteria to be treated using the new patient pathway introduced for acute tonsillitis (see figure 1).

Figure 1
Novel patient pathway for patients admitted to ENT with acute tonsillitis. ENT, Ear, Nose and Throat Surgery; UHS, University Hospital Southampton; CEPOD, Emergency operating list; ITU, Intensive Therapy Unit; TTO, Medication to take home; FBC, Full blood count; U&E, Urea and Electrolytes; CRP, C-reactive protein; LFT, Liver function test; IM, Infectious Mononucleosis; STAT, Immediately; PRN, As required.

Tonsillitis pathway

The acute tonsillitis patient pathway introduced as part of the intervention for this trial was adapted from the tonsillitis pathway published by Bird et al, with the addition of CLD. The pathway consisted of the following treatment: benzylpenicillin sodium intravenously, (clarithromycin intravenously for those allergic to penicillin), intravenous crystalloid fluids, intravenous paracetamol, ibuprofen solution orally and benzydamine 0.15% w/v mouthwash. Clinicians were advised to consider dexamethasone intravenously with blood glucose monitoring if appropriate. Initiation of treatment was conducted within 30 min of diagnosis. Protocols were created within the local electronic prescribing system. These protocols, called 'acute tonsillitis' and 'acute tonsillitis (Penicillin Allergy)' contained all medications forming the treatment intervention.

### Study of imupret application in the technology of delayed prescription of antibiotics in patients with acute tonsillitis… [^e46bd251]. ClinicalTrials (2020). Medium credibility.

Study of Therapeutic Efficacy, Safety, and Tolerability of Imupret application in the therapeutic concept of delayed prescription of antibiotics in patients with severe acute tonsillitis in children, aged 6–12. Acute tonsillitis in most cases is due to viral infections. Bacterial tonsillitis occurs in immunocompetent children in 20–30% of cases, adults
- in 5–15%, and the most frequent cause of it is β-hemolytic streptococcus group A. Acute tonsillitis is defined as the sudden appearance of the following symptoms: sore throat, hyperemia, edema of the tonsils, increase in swollen lymph nodes, and non-specific additional symptoms like fever, weakness, and joint pain. There are no pathognomonic symptoms of bacterial tonsillitis. To assess the patient's condition and to determine the indications for antibacterial therapy, the Mclsaac scale is a commonly used tool for decision.

This scale is used to classify patients according to their symptoms and to determine the patients for whom antibiotic therapy is not indicated. Additionally, a good safety profile allows to consider Imupret as an adequate basic therapy for the treatment of acute tonsillitis in the therapeutic concept of delayed prescription of antibiotics. The already existing studies were not conducted under GCP conditions. Confirmation of the high effectiveness of Imupret in the treatment of acute tonsillitis would serve as a rationale for optimizing the treatment regimen of this nosology. Schedule of visits.

During the study, 3 planned visits: Visit 1: screening, randomization, and treatment; evaluation by Mc Isaac Score scale; LTM Scale:; Sore throat at rest; Throat irritation at rest; Palatine tonsils hyperemia; Palatine tonsils edema); Patients self-assessment.
- purulent complications;
- severe general condition.
- Indication for immediate initiation of systemic antibiotic therapy
- patients at risk of developing severe complications, including e.g. clinically relevant concomitant diseases of heart, lungs, kidneys, liver, neuromuscular apparatus, cancer diseases, immunosuppression, diabetes mellitus, cystic fibrosis.

### Bilateral peritonsillar abscesses: a challenging diagnosis [^312bd3ee]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Peritonsillar abscess is the most common complication of acute tonsillitis. Bilateral peritonsillar abscesses are much less common, and they may be more difficult to detect on physical examination because the oropharynx often appears to be symmetrical rather than asymmetrical, as is the case in unilateral abscess. Previous steroid treatment may also complicate the diagnosis by masking the signs and symptoms of abscess. We describe the case of a young woman who presented to the emergency department with relatively mild symptoms despite having large bilateral peritonsillar abscesses. We believe that her symptoms had been masked by previous steroid therapy. We also review the treatment and microbiology of peritonsillar abscess.

Statement 2. Recurrent throat infection with documentation: Clinicians may recommend tonsillectomy for recurrent throat infection with a frequency of at least 7 episodes in the past year, at least 5 episodes per year for 2 years, or at least 3 episodes per year for 3 years with documentation in the medical record for each episode of sore throat and ≥ 1 of the following: temperature > 38.3°C (101°F), cervical adenopathy, tonsillar exudate, or positive test for group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus. Option based on systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials, with a balance between benefit and harm.

### Differences among international pharyngitis guidelines: not just academic [^cefa562a]. Annals of Family Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

Many countries have national guidelines for the treatment of pharyngitis. We wanted to compare the recommendations and the reported evidence in national guidelines for the management of acute sore throat in adults.

Methods

Guidelines were retrieved via MEDLINE and EMBASE and through a Web-based search for guideline development organizations. The content of the recommendations and the underlying evidence were analyzed with qualitative and bibliometric methods.

Results

We included 4 North American and 6 European guidelines. Recommendations differ with regard to the use of a rapid antigen test and throat culture and with the indication for antibiotics. The North American, French, and Finnish guidelines consider diagnosis of group A streptococcus essential, and prevention of acute rheumatic fever remains an important reason to prescribe antibiotics. In 4 of the 6 European guidelines, acute sore throat is considered a self-limiting disease and antibiotics are not recommended. The evidence used to underpin these guidelines was different in North America and Europe. North American guidelines cited more North American references than did European guidelines (87.2% vs 48.0%; ods ratio, 4.6–11.9; P < .001).

Conclusion

Although the evidence for the management of acute sore throat is easily available, national guidelines are different with regard to the choice of evidence and the interpretation for clinical practice. Also a transparent and standardized guideline development method is lacking. These findings are important in the context of appropriate antibiotic use, the problem of growing antimicrobial resistance, and costs for the community.

### Implementing criteria-led discharge for acute admissions to facilitate the elective recovery from COVID-19: an example in acute tonsillitis [^e67141dc]. BMJ Open Quality (2023). High credibility.

This study is the largest trial of CLD for acute hospital admissions to date and the first study to trial CLD in acute adult admissions. This study also presents more detailed characteristics of the study cohort compared with existing published evidence, demonstrating safety in a wider population. The most significant limitation of this study is the modest adoption of the tonsillitis pathway compared with the number of eligible patients. The reason for poor pathway adoption is not known. There may be a degree mistrust about the pathway, the results of this study will be disseminated locally, particularly highlighting the reduction in length of stay but and that the pathway is safe. The modest population within the pathway group is likely contributing to the low readmission rate and also lead to those treated on the tonsillitis pathway having significantly more comorbidities compared with those who received standard treatment. While a limitation, we can still be confident that the reduced length of stay in the pathway group was not due to patients being less complex or less unwell. This also demonstrates that modest pathway adoption is not caused by clinicians imposing their own eligibility criteria or picking specific patients to be treated on the tonsillitis pathway. One potential reason is medical staff not seeing the increased length of stay as a 'real' problem, and therefore, a degree of apathy among medical and nursing staff when asked to adopt the pathway. With a mean length of stay around 30 hours prior to implementation of CLD, the length of stay of most patients with acute tonsillitis remains relatively short and therefore may not be considered a priority for discharge. This may be demonstrated in the reduction in length of stay between the initial practice audit and standard treatment group following CLD implementation. Through the process of conducting this study, staff were made aware of the impact tonsillitis admission on bed occupancy and the departmental effort to discharge them earlier, which may have led to patients on the standard treatment being discharged more quickly. Patients with acute tonsillitis are typically admitted by medical staff called senior house officers, with 1–4 years of clinical experience. While the value of engaging junior doctors in quality improvement and NHS management have been recognised and a number of national schemes have been created for self-selecting individuals, junior doctors are not often involved with healthcare management at a systems level. As a result, many junior doctors may not see the link between length of stay and discharge time of patients requiring acute inpatient treatment and the provision of elective care.

### Clinical practice guideline: tonsillectomy in children (update) [^63aa6243]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

History < 12 months and observation before tonsillectomy: There are currently no randomized controlled trials investigating the efficacy of tonsillectomy for patients experiencing recurrent tonsillitis over a period < 12 months, and all required a minimum number of sore throats in the preceding 12 months; for example, in the study by Paradise et al, 62 (33%) of the 187 children who satisfied the Paradise criteria had ≥ 7 throat infections in the preceding 12 months. Because of this tendency to improve with time, at least a 12-month period of observation is recommended prior to consideration of tonsillectomy as an intervention, but this statement should not restrict access to tonsillectomy prior to 1 year of observation when patients may reasonably be considered in circumstances including complications of infection, such as ≥ 2 peritonsillar abscesses.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^3faa3002]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Other causes of otalgia or otorrhea that may mimic acute otitis externa — differential and evaluation: Furunculosis is the presence of an infected hair follicle on the outer third of the ear canal, sometimes referred to as localized otitis externa; clinical findings include acute otalgia, otorrhea, localized tenderness, focal swelling, and pustular lesions, and treatment may include local heat, incision and drainage, or systemic antibiotics that cover S aureus. Complaints of otalgia in the absence of swelling of the ear canal and without apparent middle ear disease should arouse suspicion of pathology outside the ear, and perhaps the most common cause of referred otalgia is temporomandibular joint (TMJ) syndrome. A complete head and neck examination with visualization of the mucosal surfaces of the head and neck, assessment of any neck masses, and palpation of the tongue base is recommended. Other potential etiologies include dental pathologies, tonsillitis, peritonsillar or retropharyngeal abscesses, carotidynia, styloid process elongation, angina, intrathoracic aneurysms, glossopharyngeal neuralgia, and geniculate neuralgia. Although otorrhea may accompany AOE, other causes should be considered; cholesteatoma may be mistaken for AOE or chronic external otitis but is typically painless.

### Acute tonsillitis due to monkeypox [^d33b76f6]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The emerging 2022 human mpox virus outbreak has presented with unique disease manifestations challenging prior case definitions.

Case Report

We present a case of a 42-year-old transgender woman with human immunodeficiency virus controlled on antiretroviral therapy, presenting with sore throat, who, after three emergency department visits, was found to have acute tonsillitis complicated by airway obstruction secondary to mpox. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Sore throat is a common presentation to the emergency department. mpox should be placed on the list of differential diagnoses when evaluating patients who present with pharyngitis to avoid complications or a missed diagnosis.

### Implementing criteria-led discharge for acute admissions to facilitate the elective recovery from COVID-19: an example in acute tonsillitis [^15bbbc56]. BMJ Open Quality (2023). High credibility.

Patients with acute tonsillitis are a good example of surgical department admissions requiring conservative management within otolaryngology. Acute tonsillitis is inflammation of the palatine tonsils in the lateral oropharynx. A common disease, is it predominantly caused by viral or bacterial infection. Symptoms typically include sore throat and tonsillar exudates but in more severe cases can present with odynophagia, dysphagia, fever and tender cervical lymphadenopathy. Patients require admission when they are no longer able to maintain oral intake including medications. Once admitted, patients are typically treated with a combination of intravenous antibiotics and analgesia and sometimes intravenous dexamethasone is added to reduce inflammation. Across the UK, mean length of stay for each patient with acute tonsillitis is 19.2 hours. In 2019–2020, there were over 73 000 NHS hospital admissions in England for acute tonsillitis representing over 58 000 bed days. A safe reduction in length of stay for patients with tonsillitis, particularly if discharged in the morning, would provide increased hospital capacity for surgical beds could assist with increased elective operating capacity as part of COVID-19 recovery plan.

### Streptococcal pharyngitis: rapid evidence review [^6d22da7c]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis is a common infection responsible for more than 6 million office visits in the United States annually. Only 10% of adults seeking care for a sore throat have group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis; however, 60% or more are prescribed antibiotics. Guidelines recommend using clinical decision rules to assess the risk of group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal infection, followed by rapid antigen testing if a diagnosis is unclear, before prescribing antibiotics. Fever, tonsillar exudate, cervical lymphadenitis, and patient ages of 3 to 15 years increase clinical suspicion. A cough is more suggestive of a viral etiology. The limited history used in these decision rules is amenable to virtual visits. After a negative rapid antigen test result, a throat culture is recommended in children and adolescents. Penicillin and amoxicillin are first-line antibiotics, with a recommended course of 10 days; first-generation cephalosporins are recommended for patients with nonanaphylactic allergies to penicillin. There is significant resistance to azithromycin and clarithromycin in some parts of the United States. Steroids are not recommended for symptomatic treatment. Patients with worsening symptoms after appropriate antibiotic initiation or with symptoms lasting 5 days after the start of treatment should be reevaluated. Tonsillectomy is rarely recommended as a preventive measure: seven episodes of streptococcal pharyngitis in 1 year, five episodes in each of the past 2 years, or three episodes in each of the past 3 years are commonly used thresholds for considering surgery.

### Guidelines for the use of antibiotics in acute upper respiratory tract infections [^fe5b6f95]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

To help physicians with the appropriate use of antibiotics in children and adults with upper respiratory tract infection, a multidisciplinary team evaluated existing guidelines and summarized key practice points. Acute otitis media in children should be diagnosed only if there is abrupt onset, signs of middle ear effusion, and symptoms of inflammation. A period of observation without immediate use of antibiotics is an option for certain children. In patients with sinus infection, acute bacterial rhinosinusitis should be diagnosed and treated with antibiotics only if symptoms have not improved after 10 days or have worsened after five to seven days. In patients with sore throat, a diagnosis of group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus pharyngitis generally requires confirmation with rapid antigen testing, although other guidelines allow for empiric therapy if a validated clinical rule suggests a high likelihood of infection. Acute bronchitis in otherwise healthy adults should not be treated with antibiotics; delayed prescriptions may help ease patient fears and simultaneously reduce inappropriate use of antibiotics.

### The impact of national guidelines on the diagnostics of sore throat in children [^6b844acc]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute pharyngitis is a common reason for seeking medical advice. The majority of pharyngitis cases are caused by viruses, and approximately 24–37% of children's pharyngitis is caused by Group A β-haemolytic streptococci (GAS). In high-income countries, rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease are rare complications of GAS infections, but they still impose a large disease burden in low-income countries. GAS pharyngitis can lead to suppurative complications, such as peritonsillar and retropharyngeal abscess, as well as toxin-mediated complications, scarlet fever, and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. These complications are rare in high-income countries, and GAS is usually self-limited; therefore, antibiotic treatment should not be started to only prevent suppurative complications or relieve symptoms in patients with mild symptoms.

The Finnish treatment guidelines for sore throat were updated in June 2020, and the Centor score was presented as a diagnostic tool for GAS pharyngitis. According to the Centor criteria, one point is given for each of the following symptoms and clinical findings: absence of cough, tender and swollen submandibular lymph nodes, tonsillar exudate or swollen tonsils, and fever ≥ 38˚C. In the guideline update Centor score is recommended to use to direct antibiotic treatment to patients with more severe symptoms and higher likelihood of GAS. Patients with mild symptoms and Centor score (0–2) are recommended to be treated symptomatically and patients with severe symptoms (3–4) are recommended to be treated based on microbiological test results. A new guideline for microbiological testing of GAS was also provided. The new guidelines recommend using a rapid antigen detection test in patients with a Centor score of 3 or more. Throat culture should only be used in patients with prolonged symptoms or in epidemic situations. The guidelines also recommend against using C-reactive protein (CRP) tests in the diagnosis of pharyngitis, as they are ineffective at distinguishing viral from bacterial pathogens.

The aim of this study was to determine how the publication of the updated Finnish Current Care Guidelines affected treatment for pediatric patients, particularly the use of the Centor criteria, CRP tests, and microbiological testing in the diagnosis of GAS tonsillitis.

### Clinical guidance for group A streptococcal pharyngitis… [^2d54ac5a]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Cause Group A streptococcal pharyngitis is an infection of the oropharynx caused by Streptococcus pyogenes. The incubation period of group A strep pharyngitis is approximately 2 to 5 days. Keep ReadingGroup A Strep Bacteria and How They Spread. Clinical features Acute pharyngitis symptoms It commonly presents with
- Fever
- Pain with swallowing
- Sudden onset of sore throat On clinical examination, patients with group A strep pharyngitis usually have
- Anterior cervical lymphadenopathy
- Palatal petechiae
- Pharyngeal and tonsillar erythema
- Tonsillar hypertrophy with or without exudates Patients with group A strep pharyngitis may also present with a scarlatiniform rash. The resulting syndrome is scarlet fever. Keep ReadingClinical Guidance for Scarlet Fever.

Less common symptoms Other symptoms, especially among children, may include:

- Abdominal pain
- Headache
- Nausea and vomiting Subacute illness Respiratory disease caused by group A strep infection in children younger than 3 years of age rarely manifests as acute pharyngitis. Instead, these children usually have what is called "streptococcal fever" or "streptococcosis, " which involves mucopurulent rhinitis followed by:

- Anorexia
- Fever
- Irritability. Recommended antibiotics Penicillin or amoxicillin is the antibiotic of choice to treat group A strep pharyngitis. Penicillin V, oral Children: 250 mg twice daily or 3 times daily for 10 days Adolescents and adults: 250 mg 4 times daily or 500 mg twice daily, for 10 days. Complications Rarely, complications can occur after group A strep pharyngitis. Suppurative complications Suppurative complications result from the spread of group A strep bacteria from the pharynx to adjacent structures.

They can include:

- Cervical lymphadenitis
- Mastoiditis
- Peritonsillar abscess
- Retropharyngeal abscess Other focal infections or sepsis are even less common. These complications are more likely to occur after an untreated infection.

### Tonsillectomy for the treatment of tonsillitis-induced immunoglobulin A nephropathy [^5771a3b5]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2009). Low credibility.

Tubular occlusion from red blood cell casts secondary to immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) is a rare, serious complication of tonsillitis that can cause acute renal failure, also referred to as acute kidney injury. IgAN is the most common primary glomerulonephritis with up to 20% of cases resulting in renal failure worldwide. Tonsillectomy is an effective treatment option for patients suffering from IgAN secondary to recurrent acute tonsillitis. Tonsillectomy alone or in combination with additional medical modalities improves renal function and can have a positive effect on long-term renal survival.

Tonsillitis and/or Pharyngitis

MOXATAG is a penicillin-class antibacterial indicated for the treatment of tonsillitis and/or pharyngitis secondary to Streptococcus pyogenes (S. pyogenes) in adults and pediatric patients 12 yrs and older.

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of MOXATAG and other antibacterial drugs, MOXATAG should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

### Clinical practice guideline: tonsillectomy in children (update) [^1b060340]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Efficacy and effectiveness of tonsillectomy for recurrent throat infection show short-term benefits that diminish over time. Evidence "suggest[s] a modest but statistically significant reduction in frequency of throat infection among severely affected patients undergoing tonsillectomy for 1 year but no longer". In a trial meeting strict episode criteria, "the tonsillectomy group experienced a mean rate reduction of 1.9 episodes per year in the first year of follow-up", whereas controls had "a mean rate reduction of 0.5 to 1 episodes per year". For moderate or severe episodes, controls had "1.2 episodes in the first year versus 0.1 in the surgical group".

### Characterisation of antibiotic prescriptions for acute respiratory tract infections in Danish general practice: a retrospective registry based cohort study [^aa32f3b6]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Antibiotic use for patients diagnosed with acute tonsillitis was predominantly penicillin V (86%), which may be perceived as in line with national recommendations. Furthermore, less than 6% of the antibiotic prescriptions for acute tonsillitis were administered in children under 3 years, a group having a low a priori risk of strep throat. In Dutch children, the use of first-line treatment with penicillin V in acute tonsillitis was 60%. Most Danish general practitioners (GPs) use point-of-care tests to swab for the presence of Streptococcus group A antigen as part of the clinical management of sore throat. Identifying a causable pathogen may lead to choosing a relevant narrow-spectrum agent such as penicillin V.

Today, AOM is mostly perceived as a self-limiting disease in children older than 2 years of age and the modest benefit of antibiotic treatment has been established. Still two-thirds of all prescriptions are given in children older than 2 years of age and half in patients aged more than 5 years. This finding indicates a possible overuse of antibiotics in patients diagnosed with AOM, which is a common reason for antibiotic use in children.

### Acute pharyngitis [^fc300551]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2001). Excellent credibility.

The primary care physician needs to identify those patients with acute pharyngitis who require specific antimicrobial therapy and to avoid unnecessary and potentially deleterious treatment in the large majority of patients who have a benign, self-limited infection that is usually viral. In most cases, differentiating between these two types of infection can be accomplished easily if the physician considers the epidemiologic setting, the history, and the physical findings, plus the results of a few readily available laboratory tests. When antimicrobial therapy is required, the safest, narrowest-spectrum, and most cost-effective drugs should be used. Despite agreement on these principles by expert advisory committees, data from national surveys of ambulatory care indicate that antimicrobial agents continue to be prescribed indiscriminately for upper respiratory infections.

8.4 Pediatric Use

[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), Indications and Usage (1.2), and Dosage and Administration (2.2)]

Safety and effectiveness in the treatment of pediatric patients with acute otitis media, acute bacterial sinusitis and community-acquired pneumonia under 6 months of age have not been established. Use of azithromycin for the treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis and community-acquired pneumonia in pediatric patients (6 months of age or greater) is supported by adequate and well-controlled trials in adults.

Pharyngitis/Tonsillitis: Safety and effectiveness in the treatment of pediatric patients with pharyngitis/tonsillitis under 2 years of age have not been established.

8.5 Geriatric Use

In multiple-dose clinical trials of oral azithromycin, 9% of patients were at least 65 years of age (458/4949) and 3% of patients (144/4949) were at least 75 years of age. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in response between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.

Elderly patients may be more susceptible to development of torsades de pointes arrhythmias than younger patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]

### Clinical practice guideline: tonsillectomy in children (update) [^c3dba18f]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Paradise criteria for tonsillectomy — recurrent throat infection in children requires specified episode frequency plus qualifying clinical features, treatment, and documentation. Minimum frequency is Seven or more episodes in the preceding year, OR Five or more episodes in each of the preceding 2 y, OR Three or more episodes in each of the preceding 3 y. Clinical features that qualify an episode are Temperature > 38.3°C (> 101°F), Cervical lymphadenopathy (tender lymph nodes or > 2 cm), Tonsillar exudate, or Positive culture for group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus, and sore throat plus the presence of ≥ 1 qualifies as a counting episode. Treatment requires that antibiotics had been administered in conventional dosage for proved or suspected streptococcal episodes. Documentation requires contemporaneous clinical record for each episode OR, if not fully documented, subsequent observance by the clinician of 2 episodes with consistent patterns; children who meet all other criteria may nonetheless qualify if the same pattern is observed and documented by the clinician in 2 subsequent episodes, and a 12-month period of observation is usually recommended prior to consideration of tonsillectomy as an intervention.

Pathway results

There were 137 patient admissions for acute tonsillitis during the post pathway implementation period. Thirty-five patient admissions were excluded from the study as they did not meet the pathway eligibility criteria. These patients were either being readmitted (n = 8), too unwell (n = 14), for example, evidence of septic shock or had an uncertain diagnosis at the time of admission (n = 12). One individual was not placed on the pathway due to pregnancy but was not otherwise ineligible. Of the 102 patients deemed eligible, 23 were treated on the tonsillitis pathway and 79 received standard treatment (see figure 2). The number of comorbidities was the only significant difference between study groups with those on the pathway having more concurrent conditions than those who received standard treatment. There was no difference, in age, gender, ethnicity or incidence of EBV (Ebstein Barr Virus) positive tonsillitis. 95.7% of patients placed on the tonsillitis pathway were prescribed medications according to the locally published guideline (see table 1).

Meningococcal septicaemia was masked by an acute tonsillitis in a university student presenting to the emergency department. The diagnosis was made as a result of routine blood culture and resulted in the patient being recalled for appropriate treatment. Although the patient was relatively well, public health contact tracing and prophylaxis ensued as per any other case of meningococcal disease. This case highlights the protean manifestations of meningococcaemia and the importance of evidence-based protocols. Blood culture guidelines led to the diagnosis in the absence of clinical suspicion and in sharp contrast to the paucity of evidence informing the public health response in this area.

### Review: diagnostic potential for collaborative pharyngitis biomarkers [^47fbd095]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Pharyngitis is an inflammatory condition of the pharynx and/or tonsils commonly seen in both children and adults. Viruses and bacteria represent the most common encountered etiologic agents-yeast/fungi and parasites are infrequently implicated. Some of these are predominantly observed in unique populations (eg, immunocompromised or unvaccinated individuals). This manuscript (part 3 of 3) summarizes the current state of biomarker diagnostic testing and highlights the expanding role they will likely play in the expedited diagnosis and management of patients with acute pharyngitis. Biomarkers, in conjunction with rapid antigen and/or nucleic acid amplification testing, will likely become the standard of care to accurately diagnose the etiologic agent(s) of pharyngitis. This novel testing paradigm has the potential to guide appropriate patient management and antibiotic stewardship by accurately determining if the cause of pharyngitis is due to a viral or bacterial etiology.

### Predictors of suppurative complications for acute sore throat in primary care: prospective clinical cohort study [^30b593b4]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Methods

Overall study design

The concept of the study was to develop a simple one page paper or web based clinical proforma documenting clinical features to facilitate the generation of a large prospective cohort to predict adverse outcomes, among patients recruited consecutively where time for consent in busy winter clinics allowed. Within the observational study, we nested smaller studies to develop and trial a clinical scoring method for bacterial infection. All the studies used the same baseline clinical proforma and the same outcomes measures. The nested studies concerned two consecutive diagnostic cohorts (n = 1107) where a clinical score to predict bacterial infection was developed, and a randomised trial (n = 1781) that compared the use of the clinical score and the targeted use of a rapid antigen detection test with delayed antibiotic prescribing (see supplementary appendix 1 for details).

Practitioner inclusion criteria — So that the impact of antibiotics could be potentially explored we recruited general practitioners who reported prescribing immediate antibiotics in 50% or less of patients with tonsillitis. General practitioners had the option of using either paper or web based clinical proformas. Initial recruitment was among six local networks (Southampton, Bristol, Birmingham, Oxford, Cardiff, and Exeter) but was extended nationally during the last 18 months of recruitment.

Patient inclusion criteria — We included previously well patients aged 16 or more with acute uncomplicated illness (≤ 14 days), who presented with sore throat as the main symptom and had an abnormal examination result of the pharynx (identical criteria to our previous studies). Exclusion criteria were severe mental health problems (for example, cognitive impairment associated with being unable to consent or assess history) and complicated illness (for example, complication at presentation or incipient complication; immune suppression).

Baseline clinical proforma — This consisted of a single clinical sheet documenting age, sex, current smoking status, previous duration of illness, and the presence and severity of baseline symptoms (sore throat, difficulty swallowing, fever during the illness, runny nose, cough, feeling unwell, diarrhoea, vomiting, abdominal pain, headache, muscle aches, sleep disturbance, earache). Symptoms were recorded using 4 point Likert scales (none, a slight problem, a moderately bad problem, a severe problem), and the presence of signs (pus, nodes, cervical nodes, temperature, fetor, palatal oedema, difficulty speaking due to sore throat) to include those used in previous clinical scores.

### Review: diagnostic potential for collaborative pharyngitis biomarkers [^ebe00346]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Pharyngitis is an inflammatory condition of the pharynx and/or tonsils commonly seen in both children and adults. Viruses and bacteria represent the most common encountered etiologic agents — yeast/fungi and parasites are infrequently implicated. Some of these are predominantly observed in unique populations (eg, immunocompromised or unvaccinated individuals). This manuscript (part 3 of 3) summarizes the current state of biomarker diagnostic testing and highlights the expanding role they will likely play in the expedited diagnosis and management of patients with acute pharyngitis. Biomarkers, in conjunction with rapid antigen and/or nucleic acid amplification testing, will likely become the standard of care to accurately diagnose the etiologic agent(s) of pharyngitis. This novel testing paradigm has the potential to guide appropriate patient management and antibiotic stewardship by accurately determining if the cause of pharyngitis is due to a viral or bacterial etiology.

### Consensus treatment plans for periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis and adenitis syndrome (PFAPA): a framework to evaluate treatment responses from the childhood arthritis and rheumatology research alliance (CARRA) PFAPA work group [^b7cd4cc7]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Although the antipyretic arm was originally considered a control arm, antipyretics may be effective therapy for some children and are a reasonable option, especially for parents who are reluctant to use daily medication, are concerned about steroid side effects, or are concerned about the risks of tonsillectomy. This strategy was used prior to the discovery of effective abortive/prophylactic treatments, and no sequelae were reported in these patients.

The abortive arm was included to examine the efficacy of corticosteroids in halting the episode at onset. The corticosteroid regimen starts with the suggested dose of 1 mg/kg (max 60 mg), or 2 mg/kg (max 60 mg) in cases of inadequate response or shortened interval (≤ 14 days) between episodes. The dose was determined by the survey data which showed 64% of physicians used 1 mg/kg of prednisone (or prednisolone) and 29% used 2 mg/kg. Given both the adverse effects of corticosteroids and the survey showing preference for the 1 mg/kg dose, we chose to start with the lower dose, which can be increased to 2 mg/kg (max 60 mg) as a single dose if the response to 1 mg/kg was incomplete. We allowed intervals of ≥ 21 days for response to corticosteroids and recommended changing to another arm in the case of frequent flares (≤ 14 days). In the case of intervals between 14 and 21 days, it was recommended that the steroid dose be increased from 1 mg/kg to 2 mg/kg. If the interval increased to ≥ 21 days, then steroids would be continued at this higher dose. If they did not, then a different treatment arm is recommended.

In a randomized, parallel-group, multi-center, double-blind, double-dummy study in adults and pediatrics (age ≥ 12 years) with tonsillitis and/or pharyngitis secondary to S. pyogenes, MOXATAG 775 mg QD for 10 days was non-inferior to penicillin VK 250 mg QID for 10 days.

Using strict evaluability and microbiologic response criteria 4–8 days post-therapy, the following bacteriological eradication rates and statistical outcomes in the per-protocol (PPb) and modified intent-to-treat (mITT) populations were obtained (Table 4). The mITT population included all randomized patients with a positive throat culture for S. pyogenes at baseline. The PPb population included mITT patients who had post-therapy cultures, were compliant with treatment, and didn't have major protocol violations.

### Clinical score and rapid antigen detection test to guide antibiotic use for sore throats: randomised controlled trial of PRISM (primary care streptococcal management) [^b81921e4]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Rationale for changing the clinical scores during the trial: separate diagnostic studies

We used two diagnostic studies in patients not involved in the trial (combined n = 1107) to develop the clinical scores to predict streptococcal infection with Lancefield C, G, and A groups. The initial plan was to follow a traditional "sequential" approach of developing a score in one cohort, then validating it a second cohort to get round the problem of overfitting. The first part of the trial used a clinical score developed from the first diagnostic study (score 1; area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) of 0.76). The second diagnostic study, however, showed considerably reduced discrimination for score 1 (AUC 0.65) because of inconsistent performance of the variables making up score 1. We therefore used a modified approach to generate a second score (score 2; acronym FeverPAIN), using data from both diagnostic studies and corrected for the problem of overfitting by using bootstrapping techniques. Variables were included in the second score only if they were significant in univariate analysis of both diagnostic studies and in the multivariate analysis of at least one of the two diagnostic studies.

Score 2 had moderate discrimination in both cohorts (AUC first cohort 0.74, second 0.71), better than the Centor criteria (0.72 and 0.65, respectively). Unlike the Centor criteria, score 2 (FeverPAIN) performed well in identifying a substantial number of participants at low risk of streptococcal infection. Although the second score had internal validation with bootstrapping of the estimates, ideally further external validation is needed. The features of score 2 were: fever during previous 24 hours; purulence; attend rapidly (within three days); inflamed tonsils; no cough/coryza (acronym FeverPAIN)) (see appendix 1 for further details).

Trial recruitment

Health professionals, mainly general practitioners but also triage practice nurses, recruited patients presenting with acute sore throat in general practices in south and central England.

Inclusion criteria

Included patients were people aged ≥ 3 presenting with acute sore throat (two weeks or less of sore throat) and an abnormal looking throat — that is, erythema and/or pus — as in our previous studies in primary care). Exclusion criteria were non-infective causes of sore throat (such as aphthous ulceration, candida, drugs) and inability of patient or parent/guardian to consent (such as dementia, uncontrolled psychosis).

### Predictors of suppurative complications for acute sore throat in primary care: prospective clinical cohort study [^fdbc45c6]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

Severe earache and tonsillar inflammation in acute sore throat predict the development of complications, but most cases of complications of acute sore throat occur in the absence of either variable, so history taking and examination in primary care are of limited predictive value. The scores used to assess risk of bacterial infection are also not useful in predicting complications. The most important suppurative complications are uncommon in a resource rich setting.

### Infectious indications for tonsillectomy [^21780b3b]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Tonsillectomy is the most common major surgery performed on children in the United States. Recurrent throat infections of either bacterial or viral etiology can cause significant morbidity and decreased quality of life, and potentially lead to life-threatening complications. When performed in the proper patient, tonsillectomy can be a highly effective procedure. Recent clinical trials have sought to better define the appropriate infectious indications for surgery. Despite the improved understanding gained from these studies, the decision to operate always must be made on an individual basis with the primary care physician, surgeon, patient, and family all involved in the decision-making process.

### Ceftibuten dihydrate (Cedax) [^ca04a75d]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

CEDAX (ceftibuten) is indicated for the treatment of individuals with mild-to-moderate infections caused by susceptible strains of the designated microorganisms in the specific conditions listed below (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION and CLINICAL STUDIES sections).

Acute Bacterial Exacerbations of Chronic Bronchitis due to Haemophilus influenzae (including β-lactamase-producing strains), Moraxella catarrhalis (including β-lactamase-producing strains), or Streptococcus pneumoniae (penicillin-susceptible strains only).

NOTE: In acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis clinical trials where Moraxella catarrhalis was isolated from infected sputum at baseline, ceftibuten clinical efficacy was 22% less than control.

Acute Bacterial Otitis Media due to Haemophilus influenzae (including β-lactamase-producing strains), Moraxella catarrhalis (including β-lactamase-producing strains), or Streptococcus pyogenes.

NOTE: Although ceftibuten used empirically was equivalent to comparators in the treatment of clinically and/or microbiologically documented acute otitis media, the efficacy against Streptococcus pneumoniae was 23% less than control. Therefore, ceftibuten should be given empirically only when adequate antimicrobial coverage against Streptococcus pneumoniae has been previously administered.

Pharyngitis and Tonsillitis due to Streptococcus pyogenes.

NOTE: Only penicillin by the intramuscular route of administration has been shown to be effective in the prophylaxis of rheumatic fever. Ceftibuten is generally effective in the eradication of Streptococcus pyogenes from the oropharynx; however, data establishing the efficacy of the CEDAX product for the prophylaxis of subsequent rheumatic fever are not available.

### A randomized, open-label, multicenter, comparative study of therapeutic efficacy, safety and tolerability of BNO 1030 extract, containing marshmallow root, chamomile flowers, horsetail herb, walnut leaves, yarrow herb, oak bark, dandelion herb in the treatment of acute non-bacterial tonsillitis in children aged 6 to 18 years [^4fd48401]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2018). Low credibility.

Seventy to 95% of acute tonsillitis episodes are caused by viral infection, therefore why antibiotic therapy is not indicated in majority of cases. In such cases, acetaminophen or ibuprofen are used to alleviate the symptoms. The objective of this study was assessment of efficacy of phytoneering extract BNO 1030 (Imupret®) in patients with acute non-bacterial tonsillitis.

Methods

This randomized, open-label, multicenter, comparative study randomised 238 outpatients aged 6–18 years to receive either BNO 1030 (Imupret®) as a supplement to standard symptomatic therapy, or standard therapy. Assessment criteria were as follows: sore throat dynamics at rest and at swallowing, throat irritation associated with cough, general condition, day of withdrawal of antipyretics, the share of treatment responders, as well as assessment of "therapeutic benefit" from the use of BNO 1030.

Results

Decreased intensity of acute tonsillitis symptoms to 1 point and lower, assessed using 4-point scale starting from the day 5 of treatment (p < 0.005), alleviation of local symptoms and general condition starting from day 2 of the disease (р < 0.001), withdrawal of antipyretics starting from day 4 of treatment (p < 0.005), increase of the number of treatment responders to 81.6% (p < 0.005) versus the control were reported. "Therapeutic benefit" was 4.2 days. All patients tolerated phytotherapy well, and no adverse reactions were seen.

Conclusion

BNO 1030 (Imupret®) is a safe and effective product for treatment of acute non-bacterial tonsillitis in children aged 6–18 years, assuring therapeutic benefit when prescribed additionally to the standard symptomatic therapy.

### Principles of appropriate antibiotic use for acute rhinosinusitis in adults: background [^cf95e123]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The following principles of appropriate antibiotic use for adults with acute rhinosinusitis apply to the diagnosis and treatment of acute maxillary and ethmoid rhinosinusitis in adults who are not immunocompromised. Most cases of acute rhinosinusitis diagnosed in ambulatory care are caused by uncomplicated viral upper respiratory tract infections. Bacterial and viral rhinosinusitis are difficult to differentiate on clinical grounds. The clinical diagnosis of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis should be reserved for patients with rhinosinusitis symptoms lasting 7 days or more who have maxillary pain or tenderness in the face or teeth (especially when unilateral) and purulent nasal secretions. Patients with rhinosinusitis symptoms that last less than 7 days are unlikely to have bacterial infection, although rarely some patients with acute bacterial rhinosinusitis present with dramatic symptoms of severe unilateral maxillary pain, swelling, and fever. Sinus radiography is not recommended for diagnosis in routine cases. Acute rhinosinusitis resolves without antibiotic treatment in most cases. Symptomatic treatment and reassurance is the preferred initial management strategy for patients with mild symptoms. Antibiotic therapy should be reserved for patients with moderately severe symptoms who meet the criteria for the clinical diagnosis of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis and for those with severe rhinosinusitis symptoms-especially those with unilateral facial pain-regardless of duration of illness. For initial treatment, the most narrow-spectrum agent active against the likely pathogens, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae, should be used.

Benefits note that "Patients who proceed with the option of tonsillectomy will achieve a modest reduction in the frequency and severity of recurrent throat infection for 1 year after surgery and a modest reduction in frequency of group A streptococcal infection for 1 year after surgery", while "Risks, harms, costs" include surgical morbidity and direct and indirect costs. The "Benefits-harm assessment" is a "Balance between benefit and harm", "Role of patient preferences" is "Large role for shared decision making", and the "Policy level: Option". The group held "near consensus" but "1 member… felt that tonsillectomy should not be recommended", with some preferring to list both tonsillectomy and watchful waiting as options.

Data synthesis and analysis

We compared and contrasted studies evaluating strategies aimed at similar points in the aetiological pathway between Strep A exposure and death. To do that, we broadened the traditional framework used to categorise prevention strategies for ARF and RHD to cover strategies for all diseases and sequalae caused by Strep A (Fig. 2). In our framework, categories closely but not strictly follow level of care and studies that evaluated strategies from multiple categories were summarised in the most up-stream category (e.g. studies evaluating both primary and secondary prevention strategies were summarised in the primary prevention category). Our categories were defined as follows
Primordial prevention: strategies aimed at preventing infection (e.g. hygiene measures, social distancing, and vaccination). Preventing infection prevents acute disease and down-stream outcomes and the need for related down-stream prevention and treatment strategies.
Primary prevention: strategies aiming to reduce duration or severity of illness from superficial Strep A infections and/or prevent sequalae, generally by appropriate treatment. Duration of illness can be reduced through antibiotic treatment and relieved through analgesics. Prevention of ARF and other sequelae, such as quinsy and plausibly APSGN, can be achieved by prompt antibiotic treatment of Strep A infection. Preliminary review of the literature indicated three subcategories among economic evaluations of primary prevention strategies. They were evaluations of strategies that Reduce duration or severity of illness only Reduce duration of illness and prevent sequalae (e.g. ARF, APSGN, quinsy) Prevent development of autoimmune sequalae only Like primordial prevention, primary prevention may prevent down-stream complications and the need for associated prevention and treatment strategies.
Secondary prevention: strategies to prevent infection and illness or worsening of an established condition. These strategies typically involve antibiotic prophylaxis and were summarised as those that targeted ARF and direct sequelae Other Strep A diseases
Secondary prevention for other Strep A diseases included antibiotic prophylaxis in patients at risk of recurrent cellulitis and among close contacts of people with invasive infection –. It also included tonsillectomy among people suffering frequently recurrent episodes of tonsillitis. Tertiary prevention: strategies aimed at preventing mortality among those with severe disease, such as cardiovascular complications from RHD or sepsis from invasive infection.

### Clinical practice guideline: tonsillectomy in children (update) [^8dd5df1b]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Defining and documenting throat infection for tonsillectomy candidacy emphasizes accurate episode tracking and required sore throat symptoms. Clinicians are told it is "incumbent… to accurately describe individual episodes of throat infection and to document the frequency of these events", with "Supportive documentation… [including] absences from school, spread of infection within the family, and a family history of rheumatic heart disease or poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis". "The presence of sore throat was a necessary entrance criterion in all randomized controlled trials", and "no claim can be made that tonsillectomy is effective" if sore throat is absent "even when GABHS is identified". For children repeatedly positive for GABHS, it "is desirable to rule out streptococcal carriage", and "streptococcal carriage is strongly suggested by positive strep cultures or other strep tests when the child lacks signs or symptoms of acute pharyngitis".

### Review: known, emerging, and remerging pharyngitis pathogens [^a4f0a238]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

CASE STUDY: PHARYNGITIS

One week into the new school year, an 8-year-old girl experiences acute onset of sore throat. Her mother notes the presence of fever (103.5°F) and a bright red throat. The following morning the patient is seen in an urgent care clinic. The health care provider confirms the aforementioned signs and symptoms as well as an abdomen that is slightly tender to palpation. Tonsillar enlargement/exudates and anterior cervical lymphadenopathy are absent. The provider, suspecting acute bacterial pharyngitis, performs a rapid antigen detection test (RADT) for group A Streptococcus (GAS) — the result is negative. A throat swab sample is sent to a clinical microbiology laboratory for culture-based confirmation. The mother is informed that a prescription will be provided if the culture is positive. Twenty-four hours later the laboratory notes the presence of β-hemolytic colonies suggestive of GAS embedded within normal flora. The suspicious colonies require subculturing for isolation. At forty-eight hours, isolated colonies are confirmed to be GAS using traditional microbiology methods. The provider receives the positive test result, electronically transmits the antibiotic prescription to the pharmacy of choice and notifies the mother to pick up the prescription. This process delays diagnosis and treatment, which increases the days the child is symptomatic, potentially spreading infection to others, and the risk of infection-associated complications, such as invasive head and neck infection.

This case highlights the challenges experienced by health care providers in outpatient/urgent care clinics and emergency departments that do not have access to rapid, near-patient diagnostic testing. Traditional culture-based confirmatory testing delays patient management by 24 to 48 hours. Even when considering new, state-of-the art clinical microbiology laboratories that incorporate total laboratory automation with real-time monitoring of culture growth and mass spectrometry-based pathogen identification directly from the culture plate, confirmatory testing will take a minimum of 16 hours. This approach, although promoting appropriate antibiotic utilization, negatively impacts operational efficiency of health care organizations, leads to additional school day absences, and lost wages for parents caring for ill children. Due to these testing delays, most physicians treat empirically in the outpatient setting. As such, antibiotic overuse is a much more common problem than delayed treatment or undertreatment.

Objective

To determine whether total exposure to penicillin V can be reduced while maintaining adequate clinical efficacy when treating pharyngotonsillitis caused by group A streptococci.

Design

Open label, randomised controlled non-inferiority study.

Setting

17 primary healthcare centres in Sweden between September 2015 and February 2018.

Participants

Patients aged 6 years and over with pharyngotonsillitis caused by group A streptococci and three or four Centor criteria (fever ≥ 38.5°C, tender lymph nodes, coatings of the tonsils, and absence of cough).

Interventions

Penicillin V 800 mg four times daily for five days (total 16 g) compared with the current recommended dose of 1000 mg three times daily for 10 days (total 30 g).

Main outcome measures

Primary outcome was clinical cure five to seven days after the end of antibiotic treatment. The non-inferiority margin was prespecified to 10 percentage points. Secondary outcomes were bacteriological eradication, time to relief of symptoms, frequency of relapses, complications and new tonsillitis, and patterns of adverse events.

Results

Patients (n = 433) were randomly allocated to the five day (n = 215) or 10 day (n = 218) regimen. Clinical cure in the per protocol population was 89.6% (n = 181/202) in the five day group and 93.3% (n = 182/195) in the 10 day group (95% confidence interval −9.7 to 2.2). Bacteriological eradication was 80.4% (n = 156/194) in the five day group and 90.7% (n = 165/182) in the 10 day group. Eight and seven patients had relapses, no patients and four patients had complications, and six and 13 patients had new tonsillitis in the five day and 10 day groups, respectively. Time to relief of symptoms was shorter in the five day group. Adverse events were mainly diarrhoea, nausea, and vulvovaginal disorders; the 10 day group had higher incidence and longer duration of adverse events.

Conclusions

Penicillin V four times daily for five days was non-inferior in clinical outcome to penicillin V three times daily for 10 days in patients with pharyngotonsillitis caused by group A streptococci. The number of relapses and complications did not differ between the two intervention groups. Five day treatment with penicillin V four times daily might be an alternative to the currently recommended 10 day regimen.

### Appropriate antibiotic use for acute respiratory tract infection in adults: advice for high-value care from the American College of Physicians and the centers for disease control and prevention [^f3e95f1a]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for group A streptococcal pharyngitis, more specifically with respect to indications for testing (symptomatic patients), ACP/CDC 2016 guidelines recommend to obtain rapid antigen detection test and/or culture for group A Streptococcus in patients with symptoms suggestive of GAS pharyngitis (such as persistent fever, anterior cervical lymphadenopathy, and tonsillar/pharyngeal exudate, or other appropriate combination of symptoms).

### Common questions about streptococcal pharyngitis [^77d114f8]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal (GABHS) infection causes 15% to 30% of sore throats in children and 5% to 15% in adults, and is more common in the late winter and early spring. The strongest independent predictors of GABHS pharyngitis are patient age of five to 15 years, absence of cough, tender anterior cervical adenopathy, tonsillar exudates, and fever. To diagnose GABHS pharyngitis, a rapid antigen detection test should be ordered in patients with a modified Centor or FeverPAIN score of 2 or 3. First-line treatment for GABHS pharyngitis includes a 10-day course of penicillin or amoxicillin. Patients allergic to penicillin can be treated with firstgeneration cephalosporins, clindamycin, or macrolide antibiotics. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are more effective than acetaminophen and placebo for treatment of fever and pain associated with GABHS pharyngitis; medicated throat lozenges used every two hours are also effective. Corticosteroids provide only a small reduction in the duration of symptoms and should not be used routinely.

### Sore throat: is it such a big deal anymore? [^fd82c35a]. The Journal of Infection (2015). Low credibility.

Sore throat remains a common disease of childhood, and a major cost and cause for antibiotic prescriptions. The management of sore throat remains controversial in affluent countries with various guidelines available and overall poor adherence to those guidelines. Group A streptococcus is the commonest bacterial cause with important sequelae including acute rheumatic fever (ARF). The driver for diagnosis and treatment is still questionable. In most affluent populations it is difficult to justify antibiotic treatment on the basis of preventing ARF, whereas this remains the major driver for sore throat management in populations at higher risk of ARF. Reduction in severity and duration of symptoms may be a reasonable basis to consider antibiotic treatment, and thus accurate diagnosis of GAS pharyngitis, particularly in those with more severe symptoms. The potential role of rapid tests in diagnosis appears to be increasing.

### Choosing wisely: the top-5 recommendations from the Italian panel of the national guidelines for the management of acute pharyngitis in children [^2a26ccb4]. Clinical Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

With the aim to reduce waste in the health care system and avoid risks associated with unnecessary treatment, the Italian Panel of the National Guidelines for the Management of Acute Pharyngitis in Children joined the Choosing Wisely initiative.

Methods

An ad hoc Choosing Wisely task force was selected to develop a candidate list of items for the top-5 list on pharyngitis medicine. Through a process of literature review and consensus, the final list of 5 items was chosen. Drafted recommendations were formulated and then reviewed by the task force members until a final consensus was reached.

Findings

The 5 recommendations approved are: blood exams should not be performed; antibiotics should not be administrated unless microbiologic confirmation of streptococcal infection has been carried out; if a throat culture is performed, susceptibility tests on isolates should not be executed; antibiotic course should not be shortened; because penicillin V is not available in Italy, amoxicillin (50 mg/kg/d in 2–3 doses orally) for 10 days is the first choice treatment; and steroids should not be administered for the risk of masking possible underlying severe condition.

Implications

This top-5 list can be a novel tool to spread the key messages of guidelines and to avoid unnecessary diagnostic procedures, and to promote a rational use of antibiotics in children.

### The impact of national guidelines on the diagnostics of sore throat in children [^6054c294]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The Finnish treatment guidelines for sore throat were updated in June 2020. The aim of this study was to determine how the publication of these guidelines affected the treatment of pediatric patients, particularly through the use of the Centor criteria, C-reactive protein tests, and microbiological testing in the diagnosis of Group A β-hemolytic streptococci tonsillitis.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective single-center before-and-after cohort study in Finland from 2019 to 2022. We included all patients who visited the pediatric emergency department and were diagnosed with tonsillitis or pharyngitis.

Results

We included 246 patients who were admitted before the guidelines were updated and 219 patients after. Only two patients in the after group had a Centor score reported in their patient records. Rapid antigen tests were administered to 231 patients (93.9%) before the update and 202 patients (92.2%) after (proportion difference of 1.7%, CI -3.0–6.6%). C-reactive protein was taken from 193 patients (78.5%) before the update and 189 patients (86.3%) after (proportion difference of 7.8%, CI 0.1–14.7%).

Conclusions

Centor scores were not used as recommended in the guidelines and did not impact the use of microbiological or C-reactive protein testing. More education and examining the preconceptions of health care personnel is required to implement the updated treatment guidelines in clinical practice.

### Acute tonsillitis… [^17c4e60d]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

One of the commonest infections with which the physician has to deal is acute tonsillitis. Its symptom complex of fever, general malaise, sore throat, dysphagia and tenderness of the submaxillary lymph nodes is so well known that more detailed description is unnecessary. Acute tonsillitis usually lasts for a week to ten days and is considered a self-limited disease except in the few patients in whom complications, such as peritonsillar abscess or acute nephritis, occur. However, the patients are so uncomfortable and the prostration so great that any therapy directed toward amelioration of the symptoms and especially toward shortening the duration of the illness is a welcome addition to the therapeutic armamentarium.

Salicylates and other antipyretic drugs have been generally employed, but, while this medication makes the patient more comfortable, it must be considered as nothing more than symptomatic therapy; it certainly does not shorten the disease or the incapacity resulting STOVIN JS.

### Review: current laboratory and point-of-care pharyngitis diagnostic testing and knowledge gaps [^a784bf3d]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

NUCLEIC ACID AMPLIFICATION ASSAY SENSITIVITY AND SPECIFICITY

Current IDSA guidelines primarily focus upon the diagnosis and treatment of GAS to prevent both suppurative (extension of infection into the head and neck region) and nonsuppurative (immune-mediated acute rheumatic fever or poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis) complications. Throat swab culture, the most frequently used confirmatory method for negative RADTs, has a turnaround of 24 to 48 hours, which delays diagnosis and patient management. Despite being the reference standard, as recommended by IDSA, throat swab culture is not without limitations. First, the quality of specimen collection is critical for optimal test results. In brief, 1 or 2 sterile swabs (1 for the antigen test and 1 for culture if necessary) should be used to swab between the tonsillar pillars and behind the uvula, while avoiding contact with the tongue and buccal mucosa. A study investigating dual throat swab collection comparing 2 replicate single swabs demonstrated that utilization of a single swab would have missed 9% to 12% of positives cases due to suboptimal collection technique and/or operator error during laboratory testing. Second, following specimen collection, throat swabs should be placed into transport media (eg, Amies) and expeditiously delivered to the laboratory. Transportation delays exceeding 24 hours decrease bacteria viability and increase the chance of false-negative test results. Third, technical expertise is required of laboratory personnel to appropriately cultivate and identify GAS. Lastly, cultivation of GAS or other possible pathogens does not always equate to active infection and the need for treatment; health care providers must consider the possibility of colonization in conjunction with clinical manifestations of the patient.

### Improving antimicrobial prescribing practice for sore throat symptoms in a general practice setting [^ecdae469]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Background

Antimicrobial resistance is a serious threat to health both at population and individual patient levels. A key driver of increasing resistance to antibiotics is their overuse worldwide.

The highest rates of antibiotic prescription in the UK takes place in general practice and most are for common respiratory tract infections (RTIs) such as sore throat. General practice is also where most antibiotic treatment failures for RTIs, due to resistance and adverse side effects, increasingly occur.

Sore throat symptoms is one of the most common presentations in general practice worldwide, ranging from 2–4 percent. Most are due to viral infections and 90% resolve in 7 days without antibiotics. Antibiotic use has modest benefit in shortening the duration of illness with pain only reduced by 16 hours. Although antibiotic therapy reduces the risk of very rare complications of Group A streptococcal pharyngitis such as rheumatic fever, otitis media, acute sinusitis and quinsythe number needed to treat to prevent these complications is very high. Furthermore, in clinical practice it is difficult to determine the bacterial aetiology of sore throat symptoms. Therefore, the current guidelines from NICE and PHE in the UK recommend antibiotic use should be avoided for sore throat symptoms. The guidelines further recommend that clinical assessment based on the four Centor criteria (Lymphadenopathy; No Cough; Fever; Tonsillar Exudate)should be used to decide antibiotic prescription. For Centor score three or four, 2 or 3-day delayed or immediate antibiotic prescription could be considered. Guidelines also state the parameters of antibiotic prescribing: antibiotic choice, dose, frequency and duration. The recommendation of the duration of antibiotic use is based on Randomised Control Trial (RCT) in < 18 year olds, that shows 10 days phenoxymethylpenicillin course had lower relapse rates. Furthermore, antibiotic resistance is more likely if patients received longer duration, incomplete courses and broad spectrum antibiotics such as clarithromycin. Therefore, the guidelines recommend that phenoxymethypenicillin should be used as treatment of choice and a short course of clarithromycin must be reserved for those with true penicillin allergy.

Antibiotic guidelines have introduced evidence-based recommendations to reduce inappropriate antimicrobial prescription in general practice. Thus, improving compliance with national policies will reduce antibiotic resistance and healthcare costs, it will also contribute to better patient care by reducing antibiotic-associated adverse side effects.

### Clinical practice guideline: tonsillectomy in children (update) [^71cf3ed5]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Tonsillectomy in children — definitions for this guideline include the following: Tonsillectomy is defined as a procedure that completely removes the tonsil including its capsule by dissecting the peritonsillar space; throat infection is a sore throat caused by viral or bacterial infection of the pharynx or palatine tonsils and may or may not be culture positive for group A streptococcus, including strep throat, acute tonsillitis, pharyngitis, adenotonsillitis, or tonsillopharyngitis; obstructive sleep-disordered breathing (oSDB) is a clinical diagnosis with obstructive abnormalities during sleep (snoring, mouth breathing, pauses), spans a spectrum from primary snoring to obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), may include daytime inattention, poor concentration, hyperactivity, or excessive sleepiness, and distinguishes from sleep-disordered breathing with central apnea or ventilation abnormalities; OSA is diagnosed when oSDB is accompanied by abnormal polysomnography with an obstructive apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) ≥ 1; caregiver refers to parents, guardians, or other adults providing care to children under consideration for or undergoing tonsillectomy.
