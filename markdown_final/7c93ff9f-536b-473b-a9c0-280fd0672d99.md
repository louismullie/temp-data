## Question

what tests do i do for lymphadenopathy of neck

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what tests to do for lymphadenopathy of the neck and a step-by-step approach to evaluating cervical lymphadenopathy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the initial history and physical examination to stratify malignancy risk. Then, I should verify how age modifies the imaging-first strategy. Next, I will review first-line imaging choices and when to escalate to PET/CT. After that, I need to check tissue diagnosis pathways, including FNA, core needle biopsy, and excisional biopsy, with attention to cystic nodes and lymphoma. Finally, I will consider ancillary labs, special populations, and follow-up thresholds, ensuring I reconcile any conflicting guidance along the way.

> Let me first confirm the foundation: a careful history and physical examination are mandatory before any tests, because they determine pretest probability and the entire downstream pathway. I need to check duration, systemic B symptoms, infectious exposures, prior head and neck cancer, and medications; on exam, I should document size, consistency, mobility, tenderness, matting, and whether nodes are localized or generalized, since supraclavicular nodes, firmness, fixation, and size greater than 1.5 cm heighten malignancy risk [^111yi6x6] [^112yqkYs] [^116EJVzK].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify malignancy risk features that trigger an expedited workup. Noninfectious neck masses persisting for at least two weeks without improvement, nodes larger than 1.5 cm, firm or fixed consistency, ulceration of overlying skin, and supraclavicular location all increase suspicion and justify contrast-enhanced cross-sectional imaging rather than prolonged observation [^112ziH9g] [^116AYqCT] [^114UKtom].

> Next, I should review the imaging strategy in adults. Contrast-enhanced CT of the neck is the first-line modality when malignancy risk is elevated, because it delineates nodal levels, necrosis, extracapsular spread, and potential primary sites in the mucosa; MRI is an acceptable alternative when iodinated contrast is contraindicated or when soft tissue detail is prioritized, and PET/CT is generally reserved for staging after malignancy is established or when an unknown primary remains elusive after initial evaluation [^114UKtom] [^112q1Kq9] [^114nGk3a].

> Wait, let me verify the pediatric approach before I overgeneralize adult algorithms. In children aged 14 years and younger, ultrasound is preferred as the initial imaging because it avoids radiation, can characterize necrosis or abscess, and guide FNA if needed; CT is reserved for severe infection, deep-space involvement, or high suspicion of malignancy where cross-sectional detail is essential for planning [^111TzYE4] [^111DfdPL] [^1127tgDt].

> I will now examine tissue diagnosis, since imaging alone cannot reliably distinguish reactive from malignant nodes. Fine-needle aspiration is the first-line tissue test for most adults with persistent or suspicious nodes; it is rapid, safe, and accurate, and should precede open biopsy to minimize morbidity and avoid compromising oncologic surgery. If FNA is nondiagnostic or lymphoma is suspected, ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy improves architectural yield and diagnostic accuracy; excisional biopsy remains the gold standard when FNA and core are inconclusive or when architecture is critical for lymphoma subtyping [^112ykVqU] [^1134PbZQ] [^1163LP3m].

> But wait, what if the node is cystic. I should double-check that cystic cervical masses are not dismissed as benign, because a substantial proportion harbor metastatic squamous cell carcinoma, particularly from Waldeyer ring primaries; FNA sensitivity is lower in cystic disease, so image-guided sampling of solid components or excisional biopsy may be required to secure a diagnosis and avoid tumor spillage [^1117YbCe] [^117Q3nWn].

> Next, I should review the unknown primary pathway, because metastatic cervical nodes without an obvious source require a disciplined sequence. After FNA confirms squamous carcinoma, contrast-enhanced CT of the neck is the initial imaging step; if no primary is identified, PET/CT is recommended to localize a potential occult site. Concurrently, I need to ensure a comprehensive upper aerodigestive tract evaluation with direct endoscopy and targeted biopsies, and if the primary remains occult, ipsilateral tonsillectomy is indicated because occult primaries frequently reside in the tonsillar crypts; HPV testing on nodal tissue refines etiology and prognosis [^115aAMo8] [^117KMkaU] [^115P4SW1].

> Let me consider ancillary testing, but I should confirm that these are tailored to clinical suspicion rather than obtained indiscriminately. CBC with differential, ESR or CRP, and targeted infectious testing such as TB or HIV are reasonable when systemic disease is suspected; LDH supports lymphoma workups, and in the right context, CRP to albumin ratio may help flag malignancy, though it is not definitive and should not replace tissue diagnosis [^116EJVzK] [^114uqTik] [^116iHrnU].

> I need to ensure I address special populations and scenarios. In patients with thyroid nodules or differentiated thyroid cancer, dedicated neck ultrasound with evaluation of central and lateral compartments is recommended, and suspicious nodes should undergo FNA with consideration of thyroglobulin washout; in children, ultrasound-first algorithms and conservative observation are emphasized to avoid unnecessary radiation and procedures, with surgical consultation if nodes persist beyond several weeks or demonstrate red flags [^115UDkkV] [^111RG82P] [^111TzYE4].

> Hold on, I should verify follow-up thresholds and the role of empiric antibiotics. For low-risk adults with localized nodes and a plausible infectious etiology, a short observation window with clear return precautions is acceptable, but antibiotics should not be prescribed without clinical evidence of bacterial infection; persistence beyond about two to four weeks without resolution should prompt imaging and tissue diagnosis rather than continued watchful waiting [^114AD7pq] [^115FiegP] [^113GpimA].

> Let me reconsider any potential conflicts in guidance. Some older or lower-credibility sources suggest ultrasound as a first-line modality broadly, but for adults at increased malignancy risk, multiple high-credibility guidelines converge on contrast-enhanced CT or MRI as the initial imaging test, reserving ultrasound for specific contexts such as pediatrics, thyroid disease, or image-guided procedures; aligning with AAFP 2025 and AAO-HNS 2017 ensures best-evidence consistency [^114UKtom] [^112q1Kq9] [^111TzYE4].

> In summary, I should confirm that the safest, evidence-aligned sequence is: history and physical to stratify risk; adults at increased risk proceed directly to contrast-enhanced neck CT or MRI; tissue diagnosis with FNA or core needle biopsy follows; if squamous carcinoma is found without a primary, pursue PET/CT and panendoscopy with directed biopsies and ipsilateral tonsillectomy as indicated; throughout, avoid empiric antibiotics in the absence of infection and tailor imaging in children to ultrasound-first strategies with escalation only as needed [^114UKtom] [^112ykVqU] [^115aAMo8].

---

For neck lymphadenopathy, start with a **focused history and exam** to assess duration, systemic symptoms, and red flags (firm, fixed, > 1.5 cm, supraclavicular) [^111yi6x6] [^112yqkYs]. Order **CBC, ESR/CRP, and HIV/HBV/HCV serology** if indicated [^116EJVzK]. Use **ultrasound first** in children and low-risk adults; contrast-enhanced CT or MRI is first-line for high-risk adults or suspected malignancy [^111TzYE4] [^114UKtom] [^112cX4qG]. If malignancy is suspected, perform FNA or core biopsy; if lymphoma is suspected, use core or excisional biopsy [^112ykVqU] [^1134PbZQ]. Reserve PET/CT for unknown primary or staging, and avoid empiric antibiotics unless infection is likely [^115aAMo8] [^115FiegP].

---

## Clinical history and physical examination

A thorough **clinical history and physical examination** are essential to guide further testing and management [^116NAgip].

- **Duration and progression**: Acute (< 2 weeks), subacute (2–4 weeks), or chronic (> 4 weeks) [^notfound].
- **Associated symptoms**: Fever, night sweats, weight loss, fatigue, sore throat, dental pain, skin infections, recent vaccinations, animal exposures, travel history [^116EJVzK].
- **Risk factors**: Age (> 40 years), male sex, smoking, alcohol use, immunosuppression, personal or family history of malignancy [^113wGzNw].
- **Physical examination**: Node size, consistency, mobility, tenderness, fixation, matting, and associated findings (oral lesions, skin lesions, splenomegaly) [^111yi6x6].

---

## Laboratory tests

Laboratory tests help identify infectious, inflammatory, or malignant causes. Recommended tests include **CBC with differential** to assess for infection, anemia, or hematologic malignancy; ESR and CRP as inflammatory markers; and HIV, HBV, and HCV serology when risk factors are present. Consider a Monospot test for suspected infectious mononucleosis [^notfound], and add TB testing (PPD or IGRA) when TB is suspected [^116EJVzK].

---

## Imaging studies

Imaging is critical for characterizing lymph nodes and identifying underlying causes. Ultrasound is **first-line** for pediatric patients and low-risk adults because it avoids radiation and can guide biopsy [^111TzYE4] [^117LhXwH]. Contrast-enhanced CT or MRI is recommended for high-risk adults or when malignancy is suspected, particularly for metastatic cervical lymphadenopathy [^114UKtom] [^112cX4qG]. PET/CT is reserved for suspected malignancy, unknown primary, or staging [^115aAMo8].

---

## Tissue diagnosis

Tissue diagnosis is essential when malignancy is suspected or when lymphadenopathy persists without a clear benign cause. Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) is **first-line** for suspected metastatic carcinoma or recurrent benign disease [^112ykVqU]. Core needle biopsy is preferred when lymphoma is suspected or when FNA is inconclusive [^1134PbZQ]. Excisional biopsy is indicated for persistent unexplained lymphadenopathy or when tissue architecture is needed [^112DCCiR].

---

## Indications for biopsy

Biopsy is indicated in the following scenarios:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Indication for biopsy** |
|-|-|
| Persistent lymphadenopathy > 4 weeks without clear benign cause | Yes |
| Nodes > 1.5 cm in adults, especially if firm, fixed, or supraclavicular | Yes |
| Suspicion of malignancy (history, exam, imaging) | Yes |
| Failure of empirical antibiotic therapy | Yes |
| Generalized lymphadenopathy with systemic symptoms | Yes |

---

## Special considerations

- **Pediatric patients**: Ultrasound-first approach; avoid radiation; most cases are benign and self-limited [^111TzYE4] [^114NRAhP].
- **Immunocompromised patients**: Higher suspicion for malignancy or opportunistic infections; lower threshold for biopsy [^116yUpm6].
- **Unknown primary malignancy**: PET/CT, panendoscopy, and targeted biopsies recommended [^115aAMo8].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Regular follow-up is essential to ensure resolution or to detect **progression**. Low-risk patients may be observed with clear return precautions, whereas **high-risk patients** should have **expedited imaging and biopsy** arranged [^114WGu6w]. Follow-up intervals should be tailored to clinical suspicion and patient preference [^113GpimA].

---

A structured approach to neck lymphadenopathy includes **history, exam, labs, imaging, and tissue diagnosis** as indicated. This ensures accurate diagnosis and timely management while minimizing unnecessary interventions [^116EJVzK] [^117PKCou].

### Pediatric cervical lymphadenopathy [^114NRAhP]. Pediatrics in Review (2018). Low credibility.

Cervical lymphadenopathy affects as many as 90% of children aged 4 to 8 years. With so many children presenting to doctors' offices and emergency departments, a systematic approach to diagnosis and evaluation must be considered. In the following review, we aim to provide the pediatric clinician with a general framework for an appropriate history and physical examination, while giving guidance on initial diagnostic laboratory testing, imaging, and potential need for biopsy. The most common cause of cervical lymphadenopathy in the pediatric population is reactivity to known and unknown viral agents. The second most common cause includes bacterial infections ranging from aerobic to anaerobic to mycobacterial infections. Malignancies are the most concerning cause of cervical lymphadenopathy. The explosion in the use of ultrasonography as a nonradiating imaging modality in the pediatric population has changed the diagnostic algorithm for many clinicians. We aim to provide some clarity on the utility and shortcomings of the imaging modalities available, including ultrasonography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging.

### Imaging of lymphadenopathy in the neck [^111HVVax]. European Radiology (2002). Low credibility.

Imaging is playing a major role in the assessment of cervical lymphadenopathy. In infectious disease, the assessment of abscess formation and the relation of the abscess to surrounding vital structures is crucial for its management. In head and neck malignancies, imaging can be helpful for staging. Imaging of the neck for the assessment of nodal metastases can be used to detect occult metastases or to assess operability of palpable metastases. The detection of small occult metastases has limitations, as micrometastases cannot be depicted; however, imaging can fulfill a role in diminishing the risk of occult metastases, and thus influence management. For this purpose a very sensitive technique is necessary. The currently used radiological criteria are not sensitive enough to accomplish enough reduction of the risk of occult metastases; therefore, more sensitive CT and MRI criteria, but especially ultrasound-guided aspiration, should be employed to assess the clinically negative neck.

### Lymphadenopathy: differential diagnosis and indications for evaluation [^112YtB8B]. Pediatrics in Review (2024). Medium credibility.

Lymphadenopathy is a common finding on physical examination in the pediatric population. Although it is often physiologic, lymphadenopathy can also be associated with more serious illnesses and has many possible etiologies. A broad differential diagnosis can be narrowed with a thorough clinical history, physical examination, laboratory studies, and imaging. The goal of this review is to provide a framework for understanding normal physiology, identify when enlarged lymph nodes may be associated with pathology, develop differential diagnoses associated with lymphadenopathy, and apply a systematic approach for diagnostics and appropriate management, with a focus on findings concerning for malignancy and the initial evaluation.

### Lymphadenopathy and malignancy [^113hHaki]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

The majority of patients presenting with peripheral lymphadenopathy have easily identifiable causes that are benign or self-limited. Among primary care patients presenting with lymphadenopathy, the prevalence of malignancy has been estimated to be as low as 1.1 percent. The critical challenge for the primary care physician is to identify which cases are secondary to malignancies or other serious conditions. Key risk factors for malignancy include older age, firm, fixed nodal character, duration of greater than two weeks, and supraclavicular location. Knowledge of these risk factors is critical to determining the management of unexplained lymphadenopathy. In addition, a complete exposure history, review of associated symptoms, and a thorough regional examination help determine whether lymphadenopathy is of benign or malignant origin. Unexplained lymphadenopathy without signs or symptoms of serious disease or malignancy can be observed for one month, after which specific testing or biopsy should be performed. While modern hematopathologic technologies have improved the diagnostic yields of fine-needle aspiration, excisional biopsy remains the initial diagnostic procedure of choice. The overall evaluation of lymphadenopathy, with a focus on findings suggestive of malignancy, as well as an approach to the patient with unexplained lymphadenopathy, will be reviewed.

### Diagnosis and management of squamous cell carcinoma of unknown primary in the head and neck: ASCO guideline [^115aAMo8]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2020). High credibility.

ASCO guideline — preoperative evaluation for squamous cell carcinoma of unknown primary (SCCUP) in the head and neck — states that patients undergoing evaluation for a neck mass suspicious for SCC should undergo a thorough history and physical examination including fiberoptic laryngoscopy, which may be complemented with advanced visualization techniques, such as narrow-band imaging to facilitate identification of the anatomic location of the primary tumor and to inform potential therapeutic management options (Type of recommendation: informal consensus, benefit outweighs harm; Evidence quality: low; Strength of recommendation: moderate). Fine-needle aspiration or core biopsy of a clinically suspicious neck mass should be performed (Type of recommendation: evidence based, benefit outweighs harm; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: strong). High-risk (HR) human papillomavirus (HPV) testing should be done routinely on level II and III SCCUP nodes, and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) testing should be considered on HPV-negative metastases (Type of recommendation: evidence based, benefit outweighs harm; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: moderate); note that HR-HPV testing may be done nonroutinely for SCC metastases at other nodal levels when clinical suspicion is high. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) of the neck should be the initial test for workup of metastatic cervical lymphadenopathy (Type of recommendation: evidence based, benefit outweighs harm; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: strong). If a primary is not evident on clinical examination and CECT, positron emission tomography (PET)–CT should be the next diagnostic step (Type of recommendation: evidence based, benefit outweighs harm; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: strong).

### Lymphadenopathy: evaluation and differential diagnosis [^116EJVzK]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Lymphadenopathy occurs in 0.6% of the population annually, usually from a benign cause. History should focus on lymph node location, duration of lymphadenopathy, associated symptoms (particularly fever, night sweats, and unintentional weight loss), past and current medical conditions, occupation, travel history, animal exposures, medication use, recent vaccine history, drug use, sexual history, and family history. Physical examination should first differentiate localized from generalized lymphadenopathy. Generalized lymphadenopathy is usually caused by underlying systemic disease. Although usually benign, localized lymphadenopathy may represent infection or malignancy, particularly if epitrochlear or supraclavicular nodes are affected. Lymph nodes that are larger than 2 cm, hard, or matted/fused to surrounding structures may indicate malignancy or granulomatous diseases, especially in children. When lymphadenopathy persists beyond four weeks or is accompanied by systemic symptoms, imaging and appropriate laboratory studies (eg, complete blood cell count, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, tuberculosis testing) should be obtained. Biopsy may be performed through fine-needle aspiration, core needle biopsy, or excisional biopsy. Antibiotics may be considered if a benign or self-limiting etiology (eg, bacterial lymphadenitis) is suspected. Corticosteroids should be avoided because they can mask the histologic diagnosis of lymphoma or other malignancy.

### Imaging of head and neck lymph nodes [^114L7e9y]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

The cervical lymph nodes can be affected by a variety of infectious, inflammatory, benign, and malignant pathologic conditions. Clinical history and physical examination with the complementary use of imaging is essential to accurately make a diagnosis or appropriate differential. Knowledge of cervical lymph node anatomy, drainage pathways, morphologic variations, and common nodal pathology is key to correct interpretation of cervical lymph nodes on imaging. Computed tomography (CT), MR, ultrasound, and PET/CT are complementary imaging modalities that can be used in the evaluation of cervical lymph node pathology.

### Clinical practice guideline: evaluation of the neck mass in adults [^114fRc4a]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Adult neck mass — ancillary testing and endoscopic evaluation prior to open biopsy: Clinicians should obtain additional ancillary tests based on the patient's history and physical examination when a patient at increased risk for malignancy lacks a diagnosis after FNA and imaging, and clinicians should recommend evaluation of the upper aerodigestive tract under anesthesia, before open biopsy, for patients at increased risk without a diagnosis or primary site identified with FNA, imaging, and/or ancillary tests.

---

### Clinical practice guideline: evaluation of the neck mass in adults [^112ykVqU]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) — Clinicians should perform FNA instead of open biopsy, or refer the patient to someone who can perform FNA, for patients with a neck mass deemed at increased risk for malignancy when the diagnosis of the neck mass remains uncertain. Strong recommendation based on systematic reviews with a consistent reference standard. Policy level is a strong recommendation, with aggregate evidence quality Grade A and high confidence in evidence. Benefits are a rapid, cost-effective test with high sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis, minimal discomfort, low risk of seeding malignancy, does not affect imaging results, and can prioritize further imaging or workup; risks and costs include discomfort, direct cost, and risk of nondiagnostic or indeterminate test results. The benefit-harm assessment is a preponderance of benefit over harm. Exceptions are none and the role of patient preferences is none, though value judgments noted that some patients may prioritize open biopsy prior to attempted FNA and that some patients experience unwarranted delay prior to tissue biopsy; intentional vagueness reflects that technique, operator, and setting are at the clinician and patient's discretion.

### Unexplained lymphadenopathy: evaluation and differential diagnosis [^113wGzNw]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Lymphadenopathy is benign and self-limited in most patients. Etiologies include malignancy, infection, and autoimmune disorders, as well as medications and iatrogenic causes. The history and physical examination alone usually identify the cause of lymphadenopathy. When the cause is unknown, lymphadenopathy should be classified as localized or generalized. Patients with localized lymphadenopathy should be evaluated for etiologies typically associated with the region involved according to lymphatic drainage patterns. Generalized lymphadenopathy, defined as two or more involved regions, often indicates underlying systemic disease. Risk factors for malignancy include age older than 40 years, male sex, white race, supraclavicular location of the nodes, and presence of systemic symptoms such as fever, night sweats, and unexplained weight loss. Palpable supraclavicular, popliteal, and iliac nodes are abnormal, as are epitrochlear nodes greater than 5 mm in diameter. The workup may include blood tests, imaging, and biopsy depending on clinical presentation, location of the lymphadenopathy, and underlying risk factors. Biopsy options include fine-needle aspiration, core needle biopsy, or open excisional biopsy. Antibiotics may be used to treat acute unilateral cervical lymphadenitis, especially in children with systemic symptoms. Corticosteroids have limited usefulness in the management of unexplained lymphadenopathy and should not be used without an appropriate diagnosis.

### Head and neck lymph nodes in children: the spectrum from normal to abnormal [^1127tgDt]. Pediatric Radiology (2009). Low credibility.

Lymphadenopathy of the head and neck region is a common finding in children and a very common reason to image the craniocervical region. Enlarged lymph nodes are commonly palpated by the pediatrician in the office and commonly imaged by the pediatric radiologist. The difficult task of the clinician is to determine whether the adenopathy is acute (< 3 weeks) or chronic (> 6 weeks) and when imaging is indicated. In children, radiation is always a consideration when choosing an imaging modality; thus, US is usually the first imaging study at our institution, and CT the second option, usually reserved for the very ill child or for when there is a high index of suspicion for malignancy. We present the normal anatomy of head and neck lymph nodes and the US, CT, and MRI appearances in normal and pathologic states to help clinicians generate a reasonable differential diagnosis and prevent unnecessary procedures.

ASCO SCCUP head and neck algorithm — Initial evaluation includes history and physical examination, fine-needle aspiration or core biopsy, HR-HPV testing for level II and III SCCUP nodes, EBV testing should be considered on HPV-negative metastases, and contrast-enhanced CT of the neck for metastatic cervical lymphadenopathy; random biopsies of nonsuspicious areas should not be performed. The algorithm calls for complete operative upper aerodigestive tract evaluation of at-risk mucosal sites (oral cavity, nasopharynx, oropharynx, hypopharynx, and larynx), including directed biopsies of any suspicious areas, and notes that narrow-band imaging may be helpful. If no primary is identified, branches are based on nodal laterality: in unilateral lymphadenopathy, ipsilateral palatine tonsillectomy is followed, if still negative, by ipsilateral lingual tonsillectomy, leading to "No primary identified (ie, SCCUP)"; in bilateral lymphadenopathy, unilateral lingual tonsillectomy on the side with the greater nodal burden is followed, if negative, by contralateral lingual tonsillectomy, then ipsilateral palatine tonsillectomy on the side with greater nodal disease. Boxes with dotted lines indicate that the level of obligation is moderate; bilateral palatine tonsillectomy may be considered according to clinical suspicion, at the discretion of the surgeon, whereas bilateral palatine tonsillectomy after bilateral lingual tonsillectomy should be avoided. If a primary is identified, refer to appropriate ASCO guideline of primary site.

### Evaluation of neck masses in adults [^111uF4T5]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Neck masses are often seen in clinical practice, and the family physician should be able to determine the etiology of a mass using organized, efficient diagnostic methods. The first goal is to determine if the mass is malignant or benign; malignancies are more common in adult smokers older than 40 years. Etiologies can be grouped according to whether the onset/duration is acute (e.g., infectious), subacute (e.g., squamous cell carcinoma), or chronic (e.g., thyroid), and further narrowed by patient demographics. If the history and physical examination do not find an obvious cause, imaging and surgical tools are helpful. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography is the initial diagnostic test of choice in adults. Computed tomography angiography is recommended over magnetic resonance angiography for the evaluation of pulsatile neck masses. If imaging rules out involvement of underlying vital structures, a fine-needle aspiration biopsy can be performed, providing diagnostic information via cytology, Gram stain, and bacterial and acid-fast bacilli cultures. The sensitivity and specificity of fine-needle aspiration biopsy in detecting a malignancy range from 77% to 97% and 93% to 100%, respectively.

### Clinical practice guideline: evaluation of the neck mass in adults [^114WGu6w]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Objective Neck masses are common in adults, but often the underlying etiology is not easily identifiable. While infections cause most of the neck masses in children, most persistent neck masses in adults are neoplasms. Malignant neoplasms far exceed any other etiology of adult neck mass. Importantly, an asymptomatic neck mass may be the initial or only clinically apparent manifestation of head and neck cancer, such as squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), lymphoma, thyroid, or salivary gland cancer. Evidence suggests that a neck mass in the adult patient should be considered malignant until proven otherwise. Timely diagnosis of a neck mass due to metastatic HNSCC is paramount because delayed diagnosis directly affects tumor stage and worsens prognosis. Unfortunately, despite substantial advances in testing modalities over the last few decades, diagnostic delays are common. Currently, there is only 1 evidence-based clinical practice guideline to assist clinicians in evaluating an adult with a neck mass. Additionally, much of the available information is fragmented, disorganized, or focused on specific etiologies. In addition, although there is literature related to the diagnostic accuracy of individual tests, there is little guidance about rational sequencing of tests in the course of clinical care. This guideline strives to bring a coherent, evidence-based, multidisciplinary perspective to the evaluation of the neck mass with the intention to facilitate prompt diagnosis and enhance patient outcomes. Purpose The primary purpose of this guideline is to promote the efficient, effective, and accurate diagnostic workup of neck masses to ensure that adults with potentially malignant disease receive prompt diagnosis and intervention to optimize outcomes. Specific goals include reducing delays in diagnosis of HNSCC; promoting appropriate testing, including imaging, pathologic evaluation, and empiric medical therapies; reducing inappropriate testing; and promoting appropriate physical examination when cancer is suspected. The target patient for this guideline is anyone ≥ 18 years old with a neck mass. The target clinician for this guideline is anyone who may be the first clinician whom a patient with a neck mass encounters. This includes clinicians in primary care, dentistry, and emergency medicine, as well as pathologists and radiologists who have a role in diagnosing neck masses. This guideline does not apply to children. This guideline addresses the initial broad differential diagnosis of a neck mass in an adult. However, the intention is only to assist the clinician with a basic understanding of the broad array of possible entities. The intention is not to direct management of a neck mass known to originate from thyroid, salivary gland, mandibular, or dental pathology as management recommendations for these etiologies already exist. This guideline also does not address the subsequent management of specific pathologic entities, as treatment recommendations for benign and malignant neck masses can be found elsewhere. Instead, this guideline is restricted to addressing the appropriate work-up of an adult patient with a neck mass that may be malignant in order to expedite diagnosis and referral to a head and neck cancer specialist. The Guideline Development Group sought to craft a set of actionable statements relevant to diagnostic decisions made by a clinician in the workup of an adult patient with a neck mass. Furthermore, where possible, the Guideline Development Group incorporated evidence to promote high-quality and cost-effective care. Action Statements The development group made a strong recommendation that clinicians should order a neck computed tomography (or magnetic resonance imaging) with contrast for patients with a neck mass deemed at increased risk for malignancy. The development group made the following recommendations: (1) Clinicians should identify patients with a neck mass who are at increased risk for malignancy because the patient lacks a history of infectious etiology and the mass has been present for ≥ 2 weeks without significant fluctuation or the mass is of uncertain duration. (2) Clinicians should identify patients with a neck mass who are at increased risk for malignancy based on ≥ 1 of these physical examination characteristics: fixation to adjacent tissues, firm consistency, size > 1.5 cm, or ulceration of overlying skin. (3) Clinicians should conduct an initial history and physical examination for patients with a neck mass to identify those with other suspicious findings that represent an increased risk for malignancy. (4) For patients with a neck mass who are not at increased risk for malignancy, clinicians or their designees should advise patients of criteria that would trigger the need for additional evaluation. Clinicians or their designees should also document a plan for follow-up to assess resolution or final diagnosis. (5) For patients with a neck mass who are deemed at increased risk for malignancy, clinicians or their designees should explain to the patient the significance of being at increased risk and explain any recommended diagnostic tests. (6) Clinicians should perform, or refer the patient to a clinician who can perform, a targeted physical examination (including visualizing the mucosa of the larynx, base of tongue, and pharynx) for patients with a neck mass deemed at increased risk for malignancy. (7) Clinicians should perform fine-needle aspiration (FNA) instead of open biopsy, or refer the patient to someone who can perform FNA, for patients with a neck mass deemed at increased risk for malignancy when the diagnosis of the neck mass remains uncertain. (8) For patients with a neck mass deemed at increased risk for malignancy, clinicians should continue evaluation of patients with a cystic neck mass, as determined by FNA or imaging studies, until a diagnosis is obtained and should not assume that the mass is benign. (9) Clinicians should obtain additional ancillary tests based on the patient's history and physical examination when a patient with a neck mass is deemed at increased risk for malignancy who does not have a diagnosis after FNA and imaging. (10) Clinicians should recommend evaluation of the upper aerodigestive tract under anesthesia, before open biopsy, for patients with a neck mass deemed at increased risk for malignancy and without a diagnosis or primary site identified with FNA, imaging, and/or ancillary tests. The development group recommended against clinicians routinely prescribing antibiotic therapy for patients with a neck mass unless there are signs and symptoms of bacterial infection.

### Defining the role of modern imaging techniques in assessing lymph nodes for metastasis in cancer: evolving contribution of PET in this setting [^114jKpKk]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2011). Low credibility.

Accurate characterization of lymph nodes in patients with cancer and in patients who present with unexplained lymphadenopathy is of major importance for appropriate treatment planning and determination of prognosis. Size measurements are still the most frequently used method for discriminating malignant from non-malignant lymph nodes, but are insufficiently accurate. In order to improve evaluation of lymph nodes, there is a need for imaging modalities that go beyond anatomical lymph node assessment and that allow visualization and quantification of physiological and biochemical processes at the cellular level. We review and discuss functional imaging techniques in the evaluation of lymph nodes.

### CT-based diagnosis in patients presenting with throat pain: a single institutional review [^117C13Nu]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Rationale and Objective

To determine if patient demographic data, medical history, physical examination, and laboratory tests will help predict likelihood of imaging-based diagnosis using CT of the neck performed in the ED for a chief complaint of throat pain.

Material and Methods

Single institutional, retrospective review of 367 CT scans of the neck performed for the evaluation of throat pain in the ED from August 2013 to September 2019. Patients' clinical history, physical exams, lab findings, and imaging results were recorded.

Results

A total of 367 CT scans of the neck performed for the evaluation of throat pain included a recorded exam and clinical history. Of these cases, we noted that the presence of cervical lymphadenopathy (OR = 2.69; 95% CI, 1.37–5.49), tonsillar findings (OR = 2.94; 95% CI, 1.4–6.57), increased white blood cell count (OR = 1.08; 95% CI, 1.02–1.15), and temperature (OR = 1.94; 95% CI, 1.1–3.6) were associated with increased likelihood of obtaining a diagnostic CT scan.

Conclusion

Consideration of tonsillar abnormalities, lymphadenopathy, body temperature, and measured leukocyte count prior to ordering CT scans of the neck for throat pain may increase the diagnostic yield of such exams and decrease CT utilization in the ED.

### Rapid access multidisciplinary lymph node diagnostic clinic: analysis of 550 patients [^115WkYa6]. British Journal of Cancer (2003). Low credibility.

An algorithm for evaluating a patient with lymphadenopathy has been proposed by, although this has been criticised as impractical, time-consuming and expensive in the primary care setting. A less aggressive approach making use of an adequate observation period has been suggested. Two groups have reported decision-making models that would identify more precisely those patients who should have a biopsy. The study by Vassilakopoulos et al evaluated 475 patients with lymphadenopathy in a haematology unit in Greece. A mathematical model was developed using six variables – lymph node size, location (supraclavicular or nonsupraclavicular), age (> 40 years or ≤ 40 years), texture (soft/semihard or hard), tenderness and generalised pruritus. Ninety-six per cent of those who required biopsy were correctly classified by this model.

It has been accepted that cross-sectional imaging has a higher accuracy than palpation in the diagnosis of neoplastic lymphadenopathy. The relative accuracy of each modality, however, is an area of continuing study. Ultrasound evaluation is best suited for examining superficial lymph nodes because it is inexpensive, easy to perform, has no ionising radiation and can guide fine-needle aspiration at the time of examination. In addition, the recent development of Doppler sonography technology allows assessment of changes in nodal blood flow in order to differentiate metastatic from nonmetastatic nodes. A recent study showed that a combination of grey-scale and power Doppler sonography assessing internal architecture of the node may be superior to CT in differentiating metastatic from nonmetastatic nodes in the neck. In our series, US examination had 100% sensitivity and 96% specificity for malignant nodes.

### Diagnosis and detection of sarcoidosis. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^117Buki6]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic Testing

Question 1: Should Lymph Node Sampling Be Performed in a Patient Presenting with Asymptomatic Bilateral Hilar Lymphadenopathy?

Rationale for question

Isolated involvement of mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes is a common presentation of sarcoidosis, and is readily detected by a routine chest X-ray. Many such patients are asymptomatic, and sarcoidosis is only suspected on the basis of radiographic testing for an unrelated reason. Patients with sarcoidosis with asymptomatic lymph node involvement generally have self-limited disease, and do not require treatment. However, the finding of enlarged hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes during radiographic testing is often alarming to healthcare providers and patients alike, primarily out of concern for an alternative diagnosis, such as occult malignancy or latent infection. Previous studies have reported that asymptomatic bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy is almost always caused by sarcoidosis, and, given the benign nature of this phenotype, there is clinical equipoise for pursuing diagnostic sampling in such patients.

Summary of evidence

Our systematic review identified 2,106 potentially relevant articles; the full text of 75 was reviewed. One study reported enrolling patients with bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy, but included both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, so the panel decided to separately consider 16 studies that enrolled patients with suspected radiographic stage 1 sarcoidosis. The study that enrolled patients with symptomatic and asymptomatic bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy confirmed sarcoidosis in 72% (95% confidence interval, 61–81%), but found lymphoma in 10% (95% CI, 5.3–19%) and other diagnoses (i.e. nonlymphomatous malignancy, silicosis, fibrosis, and amyloidosis) in 7.7% (95% CI, 3.6–15.8%). The 16 studies that enrolled patients with suspected radiographic stage 1 sarcoidosis collectively included 556 patients who underwent at least 1 sampling procedure. Sarcoidosis was confirmed in 85% (95% CI, 82–88%) of patients, an alternative diagnosis was made in 1.9% (95% CI, 1–3.7%) of patients, and sampling was nondiagnostic in 11% (95% CI, 8–14%) of patients. Among the alternative diagnoses, 38% (95% CI, 14–69%) were TB and 25% (95% CI, 7.1–59%) were lymphoma. The only complication reported was a case of mediastinitis that occurred after an esophageal endoscopic ultrasound procedure.

### Tissue sampling in suspected sarcoidosis: can we avoid mediastinal procedures? [^114gWGZz]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

To the Editor:

We read with interest the recent American Thoracic Society clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and detection of sarcoidosis. We are grateful to the guideline group for producing an important evidence-based document to guide clinicians across the world.

We would like to comment on the recommendation about tissue sampling for patients with suspected sarcoidosis on the basis of mediastinal and/or hilar lymphadenopathy, which forms Question 2 of the document: Should Patients with Suspected Sarcoidosis and Mediastinal and/or Hilar Lymphadenopathy, for Whom It Has Been Determined That Tissue Sampling Is Necessary, Undergo EBUS-guided Lymph Node Sampling or Mediastinoscopy as the Initial Mediastinal and/or Hilar Lymph Node Sampling Procedure?

The committee has recommended endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-guided lymph node sampling — rather than mediastinoscopy — as the initial procedure of choice to use the relatively less invasive of the two procedures. However, we believe that there is scope for an even lesser invasive approach in the scenario addressed in Question 2, applicable to a significant fraction of patients.

We have recently evaluated our experience of performing ultrasound-guided core-needle biopsy of cervical lymph nodes in 25 patients suspected of sarcoidosis who had mediastinal and/or hilar lymphadenopathy on thoracic computed tomographic scans. It is important to note that the lymph nodes sampled following ultrasound were not generally enlarged, many with a short axis dimension < 10 mm, and that in many cases, the lymph nodes were sonographically normal. Where a neck node could be biopsied, granulomatous inflammation was nearly always confirmed.

This technique is considerably cheaper than either EBUS–transbronchial needle aspiration or mediastinoscopy and less invasive than either. We therefore would strongly recommend that neck ultrasound be considered a first-line tool when pulmonologists are confronted with a patient with lymphadenopathy and tissue sampling is considered necessary to confirm granulomatous inflammation.

### Does this patient have infectious mononucleosis? the rational clinical examination systematic review [^111L39fR]. JAMA (2016). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Early, accurate diagnosis of infectious mononucleosis can help clinicians target treatment, avoid antibiotics, and provide an accurate prognosis.

Objective

To systematically review the literature regarding the value of the clinical examination and white blood cell count for the diagnosis of mononucleosis.

Data Sources

The databases of PubMed (from 1966–2016) and EMBASE (from 1947–2015) were searched and a total of 670 articles and abstracts were reviewed for eligibility.

Study Selection

Eleven studies were included that reported data sufficient to calculate sensitivity, specificity, or both for clinical examination findings and white blood cell count parameters compared with a valid reference standard.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Data were abstracted from each article by at least 2 reviewers, with discrepancies reconciled by consensus. Clinical findings evaluated in only 1 study are reported with sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratio (LR), and 95% confidence interval, which were calculated from the available data. Findings evaluated in only 2 studies were summarized with their range, findings evaluated in 3 studies were summarized with a univariate random-effects summary, and findings evaluated in 4 or more studies were summarized with a bivariate random-effects meta-analysis.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Sensitivity, specificity, and LRs for the diagnosis of mononucleosis.

Results

Mononucleosis is most commonly present among patients aged 5 to 25 years (especially those aged 16–20 years, among whom approximately 1 in 13 patients presenting with sore throat has mononucleosis). The likelihood of mononucleosis is reduced with the absence of any lymphadenopathy (summary sensitivity, 0.91; positive LR range, 0.23–0.44), whereas the likelihood increases with the presence of posterior cervical adenopathy (summary specificity, 0.87; positive LR, 3.1 [95% CI, 1.6–5.9]), inguinal or axillary adenopathy (specificity range, 0.82–0.91; positive LR range, 3.0–3.1), palatine petechiae (specificity, 0.95; positive LR, 5.3 [95% CI, 2.1–13]), and splenomegaly (specificity range, 0.71–0.99; positive LR range, 1.9–6.6). Symptoms are of limited value for the diagnosis of mononucleosis; sore throat and fatigue are sensitive (range, 0.81–0.83) but nonspecific. The presence of atypical lymphocytosis significantly increases the likelihood of mononucleosis (summary LR, 11.4 [95% CI, 2.7–35] for atypical lymphocytes ≥ 10%, 26 [95% CI, 9.6–68] for those with 20%, and 50 [95% CI, 38–64] for those with 40%). The combination of a patient having greater than 50% lymphocytes and greater than 10% atypical lymphocytes also is useful (specificity, 0.99; positive LR, 54 [95% CI, 8.4–189]).

Conclusions and Relevance

In adolescent and adult patients presenting with sore throat, the presence of posterior cervical, inguinal or axillary adenopathy, palatine petechiae, splenomegaly, or atypical lymphocytosis is associated with an increased likelihood of mononucleosis.

### Rapid access multidisciplinary lymph node diagnostic clinic: analysis of 550 patients [^1127CGjH]. British Journal of Cancer (2003). Low credibility.

Lymphadenopathy (LA) is common and affects patients of all ages. An annual incidence of 0.6–0.7% has been estimated for the general population. Patients with lymphadenopathy present to a wide range of medical specialties. When physicians are faced with these patients, the critical tasks are to differentiate benign from malignant lymph nodes, to identify serious medical conditions that require specialist care, and to reassure patients with benign reactive lymphadenopathy or self-limiting diseases.

The possibility of malignancy raises the most concern among patients and health care professionals. Prompt referral for definitive investigations and treatment cannot be overstated, as cancer is perhaps the disease people fear most. Despite the incidences of many cancers being broadly similar in England compared with other European countries and the United States, the corresponding survival rates are poorer (Table 1

Table 1
Five-year relative survival of common cancers). To address this problem, the British government proposed, in September 2000, the National Health Service (NHS) Cancer Plan to provide a comprehensive strategy for bringing together prevention, screening, diagnosis, treatment and care for cancer to improve survival. The current guideline recommends all patients with lymphadenopathy of more than 1 cm in size persisting for 6 weeks to be referred urgently for further evaluation.

Apart from cancer, there are also other medical conditions presenting with LA that will require urgent medical attention. This would include infections such as tuberculosis (TB) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), both of which pose an important public health problem. In addition, immune-induced injury disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus, sarcoidosis and rheumatoid arthritis will also require specialist care.

### Lymphadenopathy in the rheumatology practice: a pragmatic approach [^111uRjxx]. Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

The general approach to lymphadenopathy

Lymphadenopathy represents a major diagnostic challenge, because it may be observed in a variety of neoplastic, infectious and inflammatory diseases. The differential diagnosis of lymphadenopathy in rheumatologic disorders is not straightforward: it may be the consequence of a primary immune activation and a benign aspect of the natural history of the immune-mediated condition, represent an infectious complication of immunosuppressive therapies, correlate to an unrelated immune process (i.e. vaccination), or indicate a lymphoproliferative transformation or metastasis from distant solid cancers requiring immediate management.

History should focus on the presence of localized signs or symptoms that may hint towards infection or malignancy (e.g. presence of a wound or a suspicious nodule, respectively), as well as on potential exposures associated with infection (e.g. contact with animals, undercooked food, risk factors). The presence of constitutional symptoms such as low-grade fever (i.e. < 38°C), night sweats and unexplained weight loss are not differentiating. In contrast, high fever (i.e. > 38°C) is most commonly associated with infections. An accurate drug history is also helpful because of medications potentially causing serum sickness. Finally, acute onset of lymph node enlargement is more suggestive of an infectious and iatrogenic cause, whilst subacute or insidious onset points towards malignant and inflammatory causes.

Physical examination

Localized swelling typically points towards an infectious condition in the area of node drainage, even though some systemic diseases [e.g. certain lymphomas and unicentric Castleman disease (CD)] may present with localized lymphadenopathy. On the other hand, generalized lymphadenopathy is associated with lymphoproliferative disorders and systemic rheumatologic conditions. Of note, supraclavicular or axillary lymphadenopathy should raise particular attention, because they are frequent sites of tumour metastasis. The most important characteristics to evaluate during physical examination of enlarged lymph nodes are size, consistency, fixation and tenderness. 'Red flags' for malignancy are a diameter > 1cm (2 cm for inguinal lymph nodes), hard consistency, fixation to subcutaneous tissue and absence of tenderness, even though these characteristics can also be found in inflammatory non-neoplastic diseases such as CD and IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD).

### The diagnostic yield of excisional biopsy in cervical lymphadenopathy: a retrospective analysis of 158 biopsies in adults [^117GVttR]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Cervical lymph nodes are the most common site of peripheral lymphadenopathy. The underlying etiologies are usually benign and self-limiting but may include malignancies or other severe life-threatening diseases. The aim of the current study was to investigate the various underlying pathologies of cervical lymphadenopathy as assessed by the diagnostic yield of excisional lymph node biopsies of the neck in a tertiary adult practice. The evaluation was performed in light of previous literature and regional epidemiological patterns.

Methods

Retrospective analysis of hospital charts of 158 adult patients who underwent an excisional biopsy for suspected cervical lymphadenopathy at a tertiary referral head and neck service between January 2017 and December 2019.

Results

The most common underlying pathology was unspecific and/or reactive lymphadenitis in 44.5% of specimens, followed by malignant disease in 38.6% of cases. An age above 40 years was significantly correlated with an increased likelihood of malignant disease. Lower jugular and posterior triangle lymph nodes showed higher malignancy rates than other groups (100% and 66.7%, respectively). The overall surgical complication rate was 2.5%.

Conclusions

The results of the current study serve as an indicator of the variety of etiologies causing cervical lymphadenopathy. In particular, given the increasing incidence of malignant diseases in recent decades, the findings should alert physicians to the importance of lymph node biopsy for excluding malignancy in persistent cervical lymphadenopathy especially in older adults. The findings emphasize the value of excisional lymph node biopsy of the neck as a useful diagnostic tool in adult patients with peripheral lymphadenopathy.

### Clinical practice guideline: evaluation of the neck mass in adults [^112xahXC]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Metastasis patterns and midline neck masses — adult evaluation: Skin cancers can metastasize to levels I to V as well as the external jugular, postauricular, suboccipital, and parotid regions. Nasopharyngeal, tongue base, and midline oral cavity (tongue) cancers may result in bilateral cervical metastases, and patients with distant lymphadenopathy may have a malignancy outside the head and neck, including lymphoma, lung, breast, or gastrointestinal tract, and should undergo thorough evaluation of those possible sources. Midline neck masses warrant special consideration given the diversity of the differential diagnosis, including thyroglossal duct cyst, thyroglossal duct carcinoma, thyroid malignancy, or metastatic spread from laryngeal malignancy (Delphian node). The GDG acknowledges that experienced clinicians may be able to distinguish a midline neoplasm that is separate and distinct from a mass suggestive of metastasis from upper aerodigestive tract tumors, and clinicians are not obliged to follow the CPG if they are reasonably certain that clinical findings are not consistent with the CPG paradigm.

### Clinical practice guideline: evaluation of the neck mass in adults [^115ZWp34]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Upper aerodigestive tract evaluation prior to open neck biopsy — endoscopy under anesthesia with biopsies, if indicated, should be performed prior to open neck biopsy to promote thorough evaluation and reduce unnecessary open procedures; aggregate evidence quality: Grade C, observational studies, level of confidence in evidence: High, and benefit-harm assessment: Preponderance of benefit over harm with policy level: Recommendation. The purpose of this statement is to promote thorough evaluation of the upper aerodigestive tract and to reduce the incidence of open biopsy of neck masses prior to such evaluation. In the setting of a persistent neck mass that has evaded diagnosis with repeated FNA, imaging, ancillary tests, and comprehensive physical examination, endoscopy under anesthesia with biopsies, if indicated, should be performed prior to open neck biopsy. Benefits include: Potentially identify a primary site of cancer or rule out malignancy, obtain tissue for diagnosis, while risks, harms, costs include: Direct costs of procedures, adverse effects of anesthesia, dental injury, cranial nerve injury, rare complications of endoscopy (bleeding, infection, perforation, airway obstruction). Role of patient preferences: Small. May decline intervention, with exceptions: Patients who are at increased risk of procedure (anesthesia). Value judgments state the perception that some clinicians may be performing open biopsy of the neck before or without endoscopy during the same trip to the operating room and that endoscopy should preferably be performed prior to open biopsy, and intentional vagueness notes the decision to perform open biopsy is at the discretion of the clinician (after FNA has been performed and is not diagnostic) but is usually performed after the endoscopy if the endoscopy does not reveal a primary site and if a high suspicion for malignancy remains.

### Investigating the role of C-reactive protein / albumin ratio in the preliminary diagnosis of patients with unexplained neck lymphadenopathy [^114uqTik]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose: Lymphadenopathies in the neck are associated with several etiological factors, such as inflammation, infection, and tumors. We diagnose some of these lymphadenopathies using serologic tests, while others are diagnosed using biopsies. The C-reactive protein/albumin ratio (CAR) has recently emerged as a crucial inflammatory marker in cardiovascular diseases and various types of cancer. Our aim in this study was to investigate the role of the CAR in the preliminary diagnosis of patients with unexplained neck lymphadenopathy. Methods: Between 2013 and 2020, 223 patients presented to our clinic with neck lymphadenopathy. Among these patients, whose cause of lymphadenopathy was not identified, 74 patients (8 children, 66 adults) who underwent neck lymphadenopathy excision were included in the study. Patients were divided into 4 groups according to pathology results: (1) patients with reactive lymphoid hyperplasia; (2) patients with granulomatous disease; (3) patients with lymphoma; and (4) patients with metastatic disease. C-reactive protein (CRP), albumin, and CAR values were compared. Results: When the CAR of the patients were compared, a significant difference was found between reactive lymphoid hyperplasia and lymphomas (P = 0.006). CRP values were significantly higher in lymphomas than in lymphoid hyperplasia (P = 0.007). When the albumin values of the patients were compared, it was found that the albumin value was significantly lower in patients with metastatic disease than in those with reactive lymphoid hyperplasia (P = 0.032). Patients with carcinoma metastases were more common in male patients than in other groups. Conclusion: The CAR is a parameter that can be used in the preliminary diagnosis of unexplained neck lymphadenopathy. The elevation should be evaluated in favor of malignancy. It can be used as an auxiliary parameter, particularly in the diagnosis between the preliminary diagnosis of reactive lymphoid hyperplasia and lymphoma.

### Imaging of pediatric neck masses [^113ZP3Mo]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Palpable neck masses are a common indication for pediatric imaging. Such lesions may be caused by infectious, inflammatory, tumoral, traumatic, lymphovascular, immunologic, or congenital etiologies. Radiological assessment of neck masses in young children should be tailored based on patient presentation and physical examination, as well as clinical suspicion. The goal of imaging should be to help arrive at a diagnosis or limited differential in an efficient manner while minimizing radiation exposure.

### Management guidelines for children with thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer [^114g87ii]. Thyroid (2015). Medium credibility.

Papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) in children — preoperative evaluation prioritizes comprehensive ultrasound to optimize surgical planning: In all cases, a comprehensive neck US using a high-resolution probe (7.5 MHz or higher) and Doppler technique should be obtained by an experienced ultrasonographer, and all regions of the neck should be interrogated. A complete US examination should be performed prior to surgery if it was not performed with the FNA, with the goal to identify locoregional metastatic disease otherwise not appreciated on physical examination. US has decreased sensitivity to identify malignant lymphadenopathy in the central neck (level VI), and in patients with large or fixed thyroid masses or bulky metastatic lymphadenopathy, US may be less sensitive at detecting metastatic disease to deep tissue regions, such as the superior mediastinum (level VII), the retropharyngeal, parapharyngeal, and subclavicular spaces. Given the very high rate of cervical lymph node metastases in children with PTC, the preoperative identification of suspicious lymph nodes affords the surgeon an opportunity to more thoughtfully plan comprehensive, compartment-oriented, lymph node dissection during the initial surgery with the intent to decrease recurrence rates and the need for additional surgery.

### Diagnostic test accuracy of sentinel lymph node biopsy in squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx, larynx, and hypopharynx: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113RGmtA]. Head & Neck (2022). Medium credibility.

2 METHODS

This review and meta‐analysis of diagnostic test accuracy studies was conducted according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Diagnostic Test Accuracy and reported following the PRISMA‐DTA guidelines. The full study protocol is available at the international prospective register of systematic reviews (PROSPERO) (registration number: CRD42021232282).

2.1 Eligibility criteria

Included were cohort studies and randomized trials evaluating diagnostic test accuracy of SLNB using a radioactive agent and/or fluorescent dye (index test) for the detection of cervical lymph node metastases (target condition) with END or a follow‐up of at least 18 months in case of a "wait and see" policy as reference standard, in an adult human population with newly diagnosed oropharyngeal, laryngeal or hypopharyngeal SCC. Exclusion criteria were: sample size < 5 patients; previous oncologic treatment of the neck; clinical staging of the neck by palpation only; or when it was not possible to derive absolute numbers of observations for true positives (TP), true negatives (TN), and false negatives (FN) regarding the diagnostic test accuracy of SLNB for the tumor sites oropharynx and larynx/hypopharynx separately.

2.2 Data sources and search strategy

The electronic databases of MEDLINE, EMBASE, HTA, DARE, Cochrane, and Web of Science (Science Citation Index) were searched without applying restrictions, from inception to March 8, 2022. The search strategy was developed with input from the project team and then peer reviewed by an independent Health Sciences Librarian with expertise in systematic review searching. The search strategy included terms and synonyms for "sentinel lymph node biopsy", "squamous cell carcinoma", "head and neck neoplasm", "pharynx", "larynx", and "diagnostic test accuracy" (also see full study protocol at PROSPERO). Additionally, reference lists of included studies and relevant reviews identified through the search were screened for eligible publications.

2.3 Study selection

The titles and abstracts yielded by the search were screened against the eligibility criteria independently by two reviewers using standardized forms. Disagreements were discussed and resolved by consensus. Unresolved disagreements were adjudicated by an independent arbitrator. Overlapping cohorts were identified based on coauthor names and affiliations, inclusion periods and the number of included subjects. For overlapping cohorts, the publication describing the largest population of interest for this review was included.

### US-guided biopsy of neck lesions: the head and neck neuroradiologist's perspective [^117LhXwH]. Radiographics (2016). Low credibility.

Ultrasonographically (US) guided percutaneous biopsy of a neck lesion is a cost-effective, safe, and diagnostically effective procedure without radiation exposure. The benefit of real-time visualization of the needle location allows for instantaneous maneuvering of the needle trajectory for safe and accurate tissue sampling with short procedural time. Effective US-guided biopsy requires technical experience, strong clinical acumen, and skillful biopsy technique. A neuroradiologist's knowledge of head and neck anatomy and pathology allows correlation with cross-sectional imaging and enhances the understanding of US imaging evaluation. Familiarity with a spectrum of neck surgeries and reconstructions and expertise in imaging evaluation of the treated neck are invaluable in accurate identification of the target for biopsy in patients with treatment-related altered anatomy using US guidance. After thyroid nodules, the common adult neck masses are lymphadenopathy, head and neck cancer, salivary neoplasms, nerve sheath tumors, and inflammatory and infectious pseudomasses. Diagnostic expertise in the imaging characteristics of these individual pathologic conditions and their differential diagnoses also play an important role in choosing the biopsy technique and in procuring an adequate sample for diagnosis, including material for ancillary laboratory testing. Using an anatomic zone approach, this article illustrates the practical considerations in patient selection, the methodical analysis of preprocedure cross-sectional imaging and its correlation with real-time US evaluation, general principles for optimizing US instrumentation, and biopsy technique. In skillful hands, the versatility and portability of US make it the valuable modality for histologic sampling of superficial head and neck lesions. Online supplemental material is available for this article.

Core needle biopsy after inadequate or indeterminate fine-needle aspiration (FNA) — ultrasound-guided core biopsy demonstrates high adequacy and accuracy with low complications, and core needle biopsy may be first-line when lymphoma is strongly suspected. In a meta-analysis ultrasound-guided core biopsy had a high rate of adequacy (95%) with high accuracy (94% and 96% in detection of neoplasia and malignancy, respectively) and a low rate of complications (1%). In this setting core needle biopsy has a higher sensitivity than FNA (92% vs 74%), rapid on-site cytopathologist evaluation can triage tissue and direct core biopsy if preliminary cytology is concerning for lymphoma, and a patient handout explaining neck mass biopsy is available.

Introduction

Fifteen to 30 per cent of patients with lung cancer will have supraclavicular lymphadenopathy (SCLN) and anterior cervical lymph nodes (LNs). Ultrasound (US)-guided fine-needle aspiration (FNA) cytology (FNAC) is known to be an effective diagnostic tool in small size supraclavicular or neck LNs as well as in impalpable positron emission tomography (PET)-detected nodes. The latest algorithm of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance published in April 2011 incorporates the use of US of the neck to obtain cytology (figure 1 B). It clearly indicates that clinicians should offer US of the neck with an intention to sample any visibly abnormal LNs or non-US-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA) to patients with a high probability of mediastinal malignancy (LNs > 20 mm maximum short axis on CT. It also states that US of the neck should be offered with biopsy of visible LNs to patients who have neck nodes detected by initial CT. If CT is negative, non-US-guided TBNA or endobronchial US (EBUS)-guided TBNA or endoscopic US-guided FNA is recommended.

Differentiated thyroid cancer — diagnostic performance of preoperative imaging for cervical lymph node metastases shows that computed tomography (CT) in a systematic review/meta-analysis of 6378 patients had pooled sensitivity 55% and pooled specificity 87%. A meta-analysis of ultrasound and CT in 5665 patients found that CT had higher sensitivity than ultrasound, yet neither performed well in the central compartment (sensitivity of CT 40% vs ultrasound 28%). For magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a meta-analysis reported pooled sensitivity 80% and specificity 85%. For 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET), a meta-analysis of 759 patients found pooled sensitivity of only 30% and specificity of 94%. A network meta-analysis of 3571 patients reported comparable detection across imaging modalities, with ultrasound superior in terms of PPV, NPV, and accuracy, and 18FDG-PET or 18FDG-PET/CT should not regularly be undertaken prior to initial treatment.

### 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography to evaluate cervical node metastases in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma: a meta-analysis [^111uZm6X]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Positron emission tomography using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG PET) has been proposed to enhance preoperative assessment of cervical lymph node status in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Management is most controversial for patients with a clinically negative (cN0) neck. We aimed to assess the diagnostic accuracy of 18F-FDG PET in detecting lymph node metastases in patients with HNSCC.

Methods

We performed a meta-analysis of all available studies of the diagnostic performance of 18F-FDG PET in patients with HNSCC. We determined sensitivities and specificities across studies, calculated positive and negative likelihood ratios (LR+ and LR-), and constructed summary receiver operating characteristic curves using hierarchical regression models. We also compared the performance of 18F-FDG PET with that of conventional diagnostic methods (ie, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and ultrasound with fine-needle aspiration) by analyzing studies that had also used these diagnostic methods on the same patients.

Results

Across 32 studies (1236 patients), 18F-FDG PET sensitivity was 79% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 72% to 85%) and specificity was 86% (95% CI = 83% to 89%). For cN0 patients, sensitivity of 18F-FDG PET was only 50% (95% CI = 37% to 63%), whereas specificity was 87% (95% CI = 76% to 93%). Overall, LR+ was 5.84 (95% CI = 4.59 to 7.42) and LR- was 0.24 (95% CI = 0.17 to 0.33). In studies in which both 18F-FDG PET and conventional diagnostic tests were performed, sensitivity and specificity of 18F-FDG PET were 80% and 86%, respectively, and of conventional diagnostic tests were 75% and 79%, respectively.

Conclusion

18F-FDG PET has good diagnostic performance in the overall pretreatment evaluation of patients with HNSCC but still does not detect disease in half of the patients with metastasis and cN0.

### Lymphadenopathy in the rheumatology practice: a pragmatic approach [^116MnaDB]. Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Lymphadenopathy is a common clinical finding and diagnostic challenge within general medicine and rheumatology practice. It may represent a primary manifestation of an underlying immune-mediated disease or indicate an infectious or neoplastic complication requiring differing management. Evaluating lymphadenopathy is of particular relevance in rheumatology, given that lymph node enlargement is a common finding within the clinical spectrum of several well-known rheumatologic disorders including RA, SLE and SS. In addition, lymphadenopathy represents a hallmark manifestation of rare immunological diseases such as Castleman disease and IgG4-related disease that must be considered in the differential diagnosis because effective targeted treatments can now impact the prognosis of these conditions. In this review we present an overview of the clinical significance of lymphadenopathy in common and rare rheumatologic diseases and propose a practical approach to lymphadenopathy in the rheumatology practice. Differential diagnosis of Castleman disease and therapeutic options for this condition of increasing rheumatologic interest will be discussed in detail.

### Clinical practice guideline: evaluation of the neck mass in adults [^1117YbCe]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Adult cystic neck masses — malignancy prevalence and diagnostic approach: Up to 62% of neck metastases from Waldeyer ring sites are cystic and 10% of malignant cystic neck masses present without an obvious primary tumor; the overall incidence of malignancy in a cystic neck mass is 4% to 24%, increasing to 80% in patients > 40 years old. Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) sensitivity is lower in cystic cervical metastases (73%) versus solid neck masses (90%), yet FNA should be used as the first-line modality for histologic assessment and may need to be repeated with image guidance to target solid components. When a primary site is not amenable to biopsy and malignancy is suspected but repeated or image-guided FNA are inadequate or benign, an expedient open excisional biopsy is recommended, and excisional biopsy is preferred for cystic masses to reduce the risk of tumor spillage.

2.4 Data extraction

The extracted data comprised characteristics with regard to the study design, population, diagnostic workup, reference standard, procedures and diagnostic outcomes of SLNB, and anatomical distribution of SLNs. All data were extracted in duplicate by two independent reviewers using standardized forms. Disagreements were discussed and resolved by consensus. To obtain 2×2 contingency tables for the evaluation of diagnostic test accuracy of SLNB, absolute numbers of TP, TN, and FN findings were extracted or calculated. Contingency tables were extracted separately for the tumor sites oropharynx and larynx/hypopharynx. Authors were contacted if the appropriate data could not be obtained from the published articles. TP was defined as the presence of metastases in SLN(s). TN was defined as the absence of metastases in SLN(s) and END specimen or the absence of regional recurrence during follow‐up in case of a "wait and see policy". FN was defined as the absence of metastases in SLN(s) but presence of metastases END specimen or regional recurrence during follow‐up in case of a "wait and see policy". False positive (FP) results are not possible because histopathological examination provides indisputable proof of metastases and therefore the specificity and positive predictive value (PPV) are always 1.

2.5 Risk of bias and applicability

The methodological quality of included studies was evaluated using the Quality Assessment tool of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS‐2). Signaling questions for bias and criteria for assessment of applicability were tailored to this specific review. Signaling questions for bias regarding blinding and threshold for the domains index test and reference standard were omitted because histopathological detection of nodal metastases is considered an objective test without threshold being used. Concerns regarding applicability were rated high when patient selection and methodological procedures of SLNB in the included studies significantly diverged from current international consensus guidelines on SLNB in oral cancer. For patient selection, concerns regarding applicability were rated high when ≥ 10% of the population had T4 tumors or a clinically positive neck. With regard to SLNB procedures, concerns regarding applicability were rated high when less than 3 peritumoral tracer injections were applied, no preoperative SLN localization was performed (planar lymphoscintigraphy or SPECT/CT), or histopathological examination of SLNs did not include both serial step sectioning and immunohistochemistry. Each included study was critically appraised by two reviewers independently and discrepancies were resolved by consensus.

### Lymphadenopathy in the rheumatology practice: a pragmatic approach [^117Pp1Cj]. Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Sarcoidosis

Despite the fact that sarcoidosis may affect any organ, lymphadenopathy is the most frequent clinical manifestation, with hilar lymphadenopathy seen in > 90% of cases and peripheral lymphadenopathy observed in 20–45% of cases. Lymph nodes tend to be moderately swollen but painless, with preferential bilateral involvement of the cervical, axillary, inguinal and epitrochlear stations. A recent retrospective multicentric study documented hilar lymphadenopathy significantly less frequently in patients with neurological, gastrointestinal and nephrological involvement. Peripheral lymphadenopathy instead was significantly more common in patients with concomitant hepatosplenic involvement and bone involvement. Histological presentation most commonly consists of non-necrotizing granulomas, formed by epithelioid histiocytes cells with scattered small lymphocytes and Langherans-type giant cells, while only 10% of cases may present with some small areas of fibrinoid necrosis. Histology is often obtained from intrathoracic lymph nodes, requiring execution of endobronchial US (EBUS)-based techniques. Despite not being sufficient to formulate a diagnosis, some sonographic features at EBUS have been found to be predictive of sarcoidosis, including the absence of coagulation necrosis, the presence of nodal conglomeration and the presence of the septal vessel sign in the colour Doppler mode. Needle sampling of cervical lymph nodes identified by neck US is emerging as a potential alternative diagnostic tool when EBUS is poorly tolerated or difficult to access. The differential diagnosis is broad, but most importantly requires ruling out the presence of lymphoma, lung cancer, and granulomatous lymphadenitis from mycobacterial or fungal organisms. Both malignancy and sarcoidosis display high 18F-FDG uptake, thereby 18F-FDG-PET/CT may be useful to select the most appropriate biopsy site but is not able to differentiate the two entities.

### Current concepts in lymph node imaging [^116KAgic]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

The accurate identification and characterization of lymph nodes by imaging has important therapeutic and prognostic significance in patients with newly diagnosed cancers. The presence of nodal metastases limits the therapeutic options and also generally indicates worse prognosis in patients. Thus, it becomes crucial to have this information before commencing therapy. Current cross-sectional imaging modalities rely on insensitive size and morphologic criteria and, thus, lack the desired accuracy for characterizing lymph nodes. This is mainly because metastases can be present in non-enlarged lymph nodes and not all enlarged nodes are malignant. PET has overcome some of these limitations but is still constrained by current resolution limits for small nodal metastases. This has fueled the development of targeted techniques for nodal imaging and characterization as outlined in this article. In the past few years, studies have shown that these newer imaging techniques can bridge some of the limitations of existing imaging for nodal characterization and thereby provide the much-needed staging information before the initiation of therapy.

Squamous cell skin cancer — workup for suspected regional lymph node (LN) involvement: The presence of palpable regional LNs or suspicious LNs identified by imaging studies should prompt a fine-needle aspiration (FNA) or core biopsy of suspicious node(s). If initial pathology results are negative, the NCCN Panel recommends considering re-evaluation by clinical exam, computed tomography (CT) with contrast imaging of the nodal basin, and/or pathology on additional LN specimens taken by repeat FNA, core biopsy, or excisional biopsy.

### Lymphadenopathy in children: a streamlined approach for the surgeon – A report from the APSA cancer committee [^115aWz9k]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background/Purpose

Lymphadenopathy is a common complaint in children. Pediatric surgeons are often called upon to evaluate, treat, and/or biopsy enlarged lymph nodes. With many nonsurgical causes in the differential diagnosis, the surgeon plays the important role of providing reassurance and timely diagnosis while minimizing the pain and morbidity associated with surgical interventions in children. The purpose of this summary paper is to provide a management guide for surgeons working up children with lymphadenopathy.

Materials/Methods

The English language literature was searched for "lymphadenopathy in children". All manuscript types were considered for review, regardless of medical specialty, with emphasis placed on published guidelines, algorithms, and reviews. After thorough review of these manuscripts and cross-referencing of their bibliographies, the attached algorithm was developed, with emphasis on the role and timing of surgical intervention.

Results

The APSA Cancer Committee developed the attached algorithm to fill a gap in the surgical literature. It outlines lymphadenopathy workup and treatment with emphasis on the role and timing of surgical intervention.

Conclusion

This review defines and summarizes the common etiologies and presentations of lymphadenopathy in children, and offers a straightforward algorithm for evaluation of and treatment with an emphasis on malignancy risk and surgical management.

### Histologic diagnoses in persistently swollen cervical lymph nodes [^114Auiat]. Head & Neck (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Biopsy and histological examination of persistently enlarged cervical lymph nodes represent a major health care issue and have high impact on further clinical therapy. Tertiary health centers are faced with an increased demand for diagnostic workup to rule out malignancy. We performed a retrospective study from January 2000 to June 2008 to identify patients referred to us for diagnostic biopsy and to document the histopathological result.

Methods

Patients with a diagnostic biopsy, but neither clinical signs of head and neck cancer nor other malignancies, were identified within the records. Patient characteristics and histopathological diagnosis were retrieved.

Results

Three hundred twenty-six patients were identified (146 women, and 180 men). One hundred twenty-three patients (38%; 44 women, and 79 men) had a malignancy: 61 with metastatic disease and 62 with malignant lymphoma; the youngest was 15 years old and the oldest was 92 years old.

Conclusion

Persistently swollen cervical lymph nodes should trigger a thorough clinical examination and prompt biopsy for histopathological workup.

### Clinical practice guideline: evaluation of the neck mass in adults [^116325sq]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) results and repeat sampling guidance — an adequate and negative FNA should not preclude additional diagnostic procedures when signs and symptoms are worrisome, and after either inadequate results or benign pathology, repeat FNA may be valuable and should be attempted prior to resorting to an open biopsy. Some indeterminate cytology cases may benefit from repeat aspiration, and discussion with a cytopathologist may guide the decision to repeat FNA after an indeterminate result. When repeating FNA, ultrasound guidance has been shown to increase specimen adequacy, can be useful when palpation-guided FNA is of limited diagnostic utility, can improve diagnostic yield in cystic or necrotic masses by directing biopsy to the solid component, and on-site cytopathologist evaluation, when available, can reduce the inadequacy rate.

### Management of persistent low-suspicion cervical lymphadenopathy in pediatric patients [^112EVtSP]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cervical lymphadenopathy in children is typically self-limited; however, the management of persistent lymphadenopathy remains unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the management and outcomes of patients with persistent cervical lymphadenopathy.

Methods

Single-institution, retrospective review of children < 18 years undergoing ultrasound (US) for cervical lymphadenopathy from 2013 to 2021 was performed. Patients were stratified into initial biopsy, delayed biopsy, or no biopsy groups. Clinical characteristics and workup were compared, and multivariate analyses were performed to assess predictors of delayed biopsy.

Results

568 patients were identified, with 493 patients having no biopsy, 41 patients undergoing initial biopsy, and 34 patients undergoing delayed biopsy. Presenting symptoms differed: no biopsy patients were younger, were more likely to present to the emergency department, and had clinical findings often associated with acute illness. Patients with USs revealing abnormal vascularity or atypical architecture were more likely to be biopsied. History of malignancy, symptoms > 1 week but < 3 months, and atypical or change in architecture on US was associated with delayed biopsy. Patients with long-term follow-up (LTF) were followed for a median of 99.0 days. Malignancies were identified in 12 patients (2.1%). All malignancies were diagnosed within 14 days of presentation, and no malignancies were identified in LTF.

Conclusions

Patients with persistent low suspicion lymphadenopathy are often followed for long durations; however, in this cohort, no malignancies were diagnosed during LTF. We propose an algorithm of forgoing a biopsy and employing primary care surveillance and education, which may be appropriate for these patients in the proper setting.

### T-cell lymphomas, version 2.2022, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^117T7KwJ]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2022). High credibility.

HSTCL — initial workup and imaging: The initial workup should include comprehensive medical history and physical examination including full skin examination and routine laboratory studies (bone marrow biopsy ± aspirate, complete blood count [CBC] with differential, comprehensive metabolic panel, and assessments of serum uric acid and lactate dehydrogenase [LDH]). Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET/CT and/or CT of chest/abdomen/pelvis with contrast of diagnostic quality are essential for workup, and in the absence of lymphadenopathy, normal FDG uptake in lymph nodes are pertinent negative findings on PET/CT scan that could differentiate HSTCL from other lymphomas; CT scan of the neck and CT or MRI of the head may be useful in some cases.

### Physical examination… [^112DCCiR]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

Physical Examination The physical examination should be regionally directed by knowledge of the lymphatic drainage patterns and should include a complete lymphatic examination looking for generalized lymphadenopathy. Skin should be examined for unusual lesions that suggest malignancy and for traumatic lesions, which can be sites of infectious inoculation. Splenomegaly, while rarely associated with lymphadenopathy, focuses the differential on a limited number of disorders, most commonly infectious mononucleosis, 8 but also the lymphomas, the lymphocytic leukemias, and sarcoidosis. 1 If neoplasm is suspected, the work-up may involve laboratory testing or radiologic evaluation, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and ultrasonography, which has been particularly useful in distinguishing benign from malignant nodes in patients with cancer of the head and neck. However, definitive diagnosis is only obtained from biopsy.

The first step in evaluating unexplained lymphadenopathy involves reviewing the patient's medications, considering unusual causes of lymphadenopathy, and reconsidering the risk factors for neoplasm discussed earlier. If a diagnosis is not suggested, and the patient is deemed low risk for neoplasm, then regional lymphadenopathy can be safely observed. Given the number of serious causes of generalized lymphadenopathy, a careful search for clues to autoimmune or infectious etiology is essential, and screening laboratory tests for several difficult diagnoses that could present with lymphadenopathy prior to other symptoms may be warranted before observation. 1, 8, 19. LYMPH NODE BIOPSY Once biopsy has been chosen, ideally the largest, most suspicious, and most accessible node is selected, taking into account differing diagnostic yields by site. Inguinal nodes offer the lowest yield, and supraclavicular nodes have the highest.

14, 16 Although the advent of new immunohisto-chemical analytic techniques has increased the sensitivity and specificity of fine-needle aspiration, 25–29 excisional biopsy remains the diagnostic procedure of choice. The preservation of nodal architecture is critical to the proper diagnosis of lymphadenopathy, particularly when differentiating lymphoma from benign reactive hyperplasia. Higher diagnostic yields can be expected from medical centers that adhere to strict protocols on specimen handling, 30, 31 and from board-certified cytopathologists. Excisional biopsy has few complications, such as vessel injury and the rare spinal accessory nerve injury. 32.
