## Question

Interactions between NyQuil and ibuprofen

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether NyQuil and ibuprofen can be taken together safely, and what the reasoning and precautions should be. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the active ingredients in NyQuil and how they differ by formulation. Then, I should verify whether there is a direct pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction between those ingredients and ibuprofen. Next, I will review overlapping toxicities and additive risks, especially gastrointestinal, renal, and hepatic effects. After that, I need to check for indirect interactions, such as antiplatelet effects with aspirin or warfarin, and consider patient-specific risk factors. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation and dosing guardrails, making sure I double-check any assumptions along the way.

> Let me first confirm the NyQuil formulation details, because the answer hinges on which product is being used. Classic NyQuil contains acetaminophen, dextromethorphan, and doxylamine, while NyQuil Severe adds phenylephrine, and some regional versions may substitute different decongestants or omit acetaminophen, so I need to ensure we are not mixing up products before concluding anything definitive [^113PY551].

> Now, I should verify the direct drug–drug interaction profile. Wait, let me verify the specific pairing of dextromethorphan and doxylamine with ibuprofen; DrugBank shows no interaction between dextromethorphan/doxylamine and ibuprofen, which supports the absence of a direct pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic clash between those NyQuil actives and ibuprofen, and by extension, the same likely holds for the other NyQuil actives with ibuprofen given their distinct mechanisms and pathways [^1159p6Q5].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about safety just because there is no direct interaction; I need to check for overlapping toxicities. Ibuprofen carries boxed warnings for gastrointestinal bleeding, ulceration, and perforation, and for cardiovascular thrombotic events, and it can impair renal function, particularly in older adults, those with CKD, heart failure, or volume depletion, so any concurrent agent that increases GI irritation or renal stress could theoretically worsen risk even without a formal interaction, which means I should counsel on minimizing risk factors and duration of use [^113cBALG] [^113vHG3Z] [^115hjHdo].

> I will now examine the acetaminophen component in NyQuil, because that is the most consequential overlap. Acetaminophen and ibuprofen are commonly combined intentionally in fixed-dose combinations for multimodal analgesia, and short-term coadministration at standard OTC doses is generally considered safe and well tolerated, with randomized data and pooled analyses showing improved analgesia without increased adverse events versus monotherapy, which reassures me about short-term coadministration in otherwise healthy adults when total daily acetaminophen stays within 4,000 mg and ibuprofen within 2,400–3,200 mg depending on indication and formulation [^116DTuCc] [^116sBdPT] [^116b5H2Z].

> But wait, what if the user is already taking aspirin for cardioprotection or is on warfarin; I should double-check the antiplatelet interaction. Ibuprofen can competitively inhibit the antiplatelet effect of low-dose aspirin if given within a narrow window, potentially reducing aspirin's cardio-protective benefit, and NSAIDs in general increase GI bleeding risk, especially with anticoagulants or in those with peptic ulcer disease, so spacing ibuprofen away from aspirin and using gastroprotection or alternative strategies may be prudent in high-risk patients [^112GEcqT] [^113MRRNL].

> Next, I should review patient-specific risk factors that would change my recommendation. In older adults, those with CKD or heart failure, or anyone dehydrated, the renal and cardiovascular risks of NSAIDs rise, so I would favor acetaminophen monotherapy or tighter monitoring if ibuprofen is used; in pregnancy, acetaminophen is preferred and NSAIDs should generally be avoided in the third trimester; in pediatrics, ibuprofen is acceptable from 6 months with weight-based dosing, and alternating acetaminophen and ibuprofen can be effective for fever but requires careful tracking to avoid dosing errors, so I need to ensure caregivers have clear instructions and devices [^115hjHdo] [^115H8fQE] [^111XT7He] [^115HMhu5].

> Let me consider dosing guardrails and practical counseling so we do not inadvertently exceed safe totals. For a healthy adult using standard OTC products, ibuprofen 200–400 mg every 6–8 hours up to 1,200–2,400 mg/day is reasonable short term, with food or milk if GI upset occurs, and acetaminophen from all sources should not exceed 4,000 mg/day; I should confirm that no other cold, fever, or prescription products contain acetaminophen or NSAIDs before layering on ibuprofen, and I should advise stopping and seeking care for GI bleeding, new edema, or persistent symptoms beyond a few days [^111XHkyV] [^113PY551] [^114H1gEg].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought NyQuil always contains acetaminophen, but I should verify that assumption because some regional formulations may not; if the NyQuil product in question lacks acetaminophen, then the principal overlap concern disappears, though the general NSAID cautions about GI, CV, and renal risk still apply, so I need to check the specific product label before finalizing advice [^113PY551].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the exact NyQuil product, screen for aspirin or anticoagulant use, heart failure, CKD, GI ulcer history, and pregnancy, then, if the NyQuil contains acetaminophen and the patient is a healthy adult without major risk factors, short-term coadministration of ibuprofen with NyQuil is acceptable at standard OTC doses with attention to total daily acetaminophen and ibuprofen limits, whereas in higher-risk patients I would prefer acetaminophen monotherapy, consider gastroprotection if NSAIDs are necessary, and avoid NSAIDs in late pregnancy, documenting the rationale and counseling points clearly [^116DTuCc] [^113cBALG] [^115H8fQE].

NyQuil and ibuprofen are **safe to use together** when following label directions, as there is **no direct pharmacokinetic interaction** between them [^1159p6Q5]. The main concern is **additive gastrointestinal risk** from ibuprofen's NSAID effects, especially with prolonged use or in patients with GI history; take ibuprofen with food and limit duration. Avoid combining with other NSAIDs or exceeding recommended doses, and use caution in patients with renal, hepatic, or cardiovascular risk factors [^113vHG3Z] [^115Kfh7g].

---

## Pharmacological profiles

### NyQuil

NyQuil is a combination product containing:

- **Acetaminophen**: analgesic/antipyretic.
- **Dextromethorphan**: cough suppressant.
- **Doxylamine**: antihistamine/sedative.
- **Phenylephrine**: decongestant (in some formulations) [^113PY551].

---

### Ibuprofen

Ibuprofen is a **nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)** with analgesic, antipyretic, and anti-inflammatory properties. It inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, thereby reducing prostaglandin synthesis and inflammation [^112XeVQ3].

---

## Potential interactions and risks

### Pharmacokinetic interactions

There are **no direct pharmacokinetic interactions** between NyQuil and ibuprofen; they are metabolized through different pathways, so no clinically significant interaction is expected [^116DTuCc].

---

### Pharmacodynamic interactions

While there is no direct pharmacodynamic interaction, **additive gastrointestinal (GI) effects** are a concern. Ibuprofen can cause GI irritation, ulcers, and bleeding, especially with prolonged use or in patients with a history of GI disorders [^113vHG3Z]. NyQuil's acetaminophen component does not directly increase GI risk, but the combination may increase overall GI discomfort in sensitive individuals.

---

### Hepatic considerations

Both acetaminophen and ibuprofen are metabolized in the liver. Although there is **no direct hepatotoxic interaction**, excessive acetaminophen intake can cause liver damage [^113PY551]. Patients with pre-existing liver conditions should use caution and adhere to recommended dosages.

---

### Renal considerations

Ibuprofen can cause renal impairment, particularly in patients with pre-existing renal conditions, dehydration, or those taking diuretics or ACE inhibitors. NyQuil does not significantly affect renal function, but **caution is advised** in patients with renal impairment [^115hjHdo].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Clinical guidelines generally support the **short-term combined use** of acetaminophen and ibuprofen for enhanced analgesic and antipyretic effects, particularly in acute pain or fever management [^1166ExBD]. This approach is commonly used in pediatric and adult populations, with careful attention to dosing and patient-specific factors [^115HMhu5].

---

## Patient-specific considerations

- **Age**: Elderly patients are at higher risk for GI bleeding and renal impairment with NSAIDs. Use caution and consider lower doses [^113vHG3Z].
- **Medical history**: Patients with a history of GI ulcers, renal impairment, hepatic disease, or cardiovascular conditions should consult a healthcare provider before combining these medications [^111WSzaP].
- **Concurrent medications**: Patients taking anticoagulants, corticosteroids, or other NSAIDs should avoid combining these medications due to increased risk of GI bleeding and renal impairment [^114H1gEg].

---

## Practical recommendations

- **Dosage**: Follow the recommended dosages on the product labels. Do not exceed the maximum daily dose of acetaminophen (3,000–4,000 mg) or ibuprofen (1,200–3,200 mg, depending on formulation and patient-specific factors) [^111XHkyV].
- **Administration**: Take ibuprofen with food or milk to minimize GI irritation [^111XHkyV].
- **Duration**: Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible [^111XHkyV].
- **Monitoring**: Watch for signs of GI bleeding (black stools, abdominal pain), renal impairment (reduced urine output, swelling), or hepatic impairment (jaundice, dark urine) [^1119LiC6].

---

## Summary of risks and benefits

| **Risks** | **Benefits** |
|-|-|
| Gastrointestinal irritation and bleeding | Enhanced analgesic and antipyretic effects |
| Renal impairment (especially in at-risk patients) | Improved symptom control for cold and flu |
| Hepatic considerations with excessive acetaminophen intake | Reduced need for opioid analgesics |

---

NyQuil and ibuprofen can be **safely combined** when used according to label instructions and with attention to patient-specific risk factors. The primary concern is **additive gastrointestinal risk** from ibuprofen, which can be mitigated by taking ibuprofen with food and limiting the duration of use. Patients with pre-existing conditions or those taking other medications should consult a healthcare provider before combining these medications.

### What do Australian&New Zealand caregivers know about children's ibuprofen? The results of an online survey? [^116uwQmx]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Ibuprofen, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) commonly used to treat pain and fever in children, is readily available for purchase over-the-counter (OTC). While ibuprofen is considered to be a safe drug to use in children, it can be associated with adverse events, especially if the dosage instructions are not adhered to. The most commonly reported ibuprofen related adverse events include gastro-intestinal, renal and respiratory complications, with dehydration playing an important role in triggering renal complications.

Important product information, precautions for use and dosage instructions can generally be found on or within the product packaging of children's formulations containing ibuprofen. However, irrespective of this available information, ibuprofen continues to be one of the main contributors to drug related adverse events, and hospitalisation in children.

### Wilderness Medical Society practice guidelines for the treatment of acute pain in remote environments: 2014 update [^117LVdsr]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

Wilderness Medical Society acute pain — nonopioid analgesia: Combining acetaminophen with a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) should be used as the first-line medication treatment of acute pain in the wilderness, unless there is a specific patient allergy or other contraindication (Recommendation grade: 1A). As the basis of medical therapy for acute injury, these medications should be regularly dosed throughout the acute injury period. NSAIDs do have adverse effects, including renal injury (especially in dehydrated patients) and inhibition of platelet function that can increase bleeding; giving NSAIDs with food can alleviate gastrointestinal symptoms, and if significant abdominal pain develops, the medication should be stopped. Short-term use for up to 10 days of over-the-counter NSAIDs with standard dosing has been shown to be extremely safe and well tolerated, and an ibuprofen dose of 1200 mg/d or less or naproxen at 660 mg/d or less has no greater risk than placebo. For acetaminophen, prescription-dose acetaminophen up to 4 g/d in an adult is still appropriate for short-term use; it is considered safe in intoxicated patients, but care should be taken in chronic alcoholics and patients with hepatic dysfunction.

Over-the-counter (OTC) medications — use patterns, sodium content, and HF risk: "Currently, 35% of adult Americans use an OTC medication on a regular basis", and "In a 2011 survey (n = 1880)… the most common choice… was OTC medications", with "one third" reporting taking more than the recommended dose and "only half" reviewing labeling before first use. "OTC NSAIDs… can exacerbate HF and increase the risk for HF hospitalization particularly when taken at higher doses". Several OTC products contain notable sodium or salicylate loads: "Pepto-Bismol contains 261 mg/30 mL and 99 mg per tablet of salicylate", "Nyquil and Dayquil contain 37 and 15 mg/30 mL, respectively, of sodium", and "Gaviscon has 52 mg of sodium per 15 mL… equates to > 400 mg of sodium per day". Sympathomimetic OTC asthma products "such as racepinephrine and ephedrine… have been associated with chest pain, hypertension, tachycardia, and hemoptysis".

### What do Australian&New Zealand caregivers know about children's ibuprofen? The results of an online survey? [^113zh423]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Children's formulations containing ibuprofen are frequently used to treat pain and fever. These medications, available over-the-counter, have the potential to cause adverse events if usage/safety information is not adhered to. This study aimed to investigate caregivers' knowledge about the safe use of a commonly purchased children's formulation containing ibuprofen.

Methods

A convenience sample of caregivers in Australia and New Zealand, who had purchased Nurofen® for Children, completed an online survey assessing their knowledge of product information and dosage instructions available on/in the product packaging.

Results

In total, 219 caregivers (mainly female 95%, mean age ± SD; 35 ± 6.82 years) completed the online survey. Responses suggest limitations in their knowledge about the active ingredients, contraindications and side effect profile associated with the product. Most respondents had a good understanding about the correct dosage to give children based on their weight and/or age, but many lacked a good understanding about the correct interval between doses and the maximum number of daily doses.

Conclusions

These findings suggest that caregivers administering ibuprofen to children have gaps in their product knowledge. Strategies to help improve caregivers' knowledge about the safe administration of these products should be prioritised in an attempt to reduce the likelihood of children experiencing ibuprofen related adverse events. Improving caregiver knowledge to address these gaps is an important issue for all health care providers.

### Guidance for healthcare providers on newest guidelines for over-the-counter drug treatment of mild symptoms of COVID-19 [^111UxyMs]. The American Journal of Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

On January 18, 2024, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued their most recent guidelines for over-the-counter drugs for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Specifically, the organization stated that "Most people with COVID-19 have mild illness and can recover at home. You can treat symptoms with over-the-counter medicines, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil), to help you feel better". In this review we consider the contributions of different types of evidence and conclude that healthcare providers should make individual clinical judgments for each of their patients in the selection of over-the-counter drugs to treat symptoms of COVID-19. This judgment should be based on the entire benefit to risk profile of the patient. It is our belief that the individual healthcare provider knows far more about each of his or her patients than anyone, including expert members of guideline committees. Their astute and judicious individual clinical decision-making for each individual patient based on all these considerations has the potential to do far more good than harm.

### What do Australian&New Zealand caregivers know about children's ibuprofen? The results of an online survey? [^113gsiAe]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Methods

This study sought to investigate caregivers' knowledge about the safe use of Nurofen® for Children. This brand was specifically chosen for this study because it is a well-recognised children's ibuprofen formulation available for purchase in many different countries.

Ethics approval was granted by the University of Wollongong's Human Research Ethics Committee (HE14/455) and the University of Auckland's Human Participants Ethics Committee (014682).

A cross-sectional online survey (Additional file 1) was administered via Survey Monkey between April and November 2015. The 18 survey questions included: five demographic questions (including a single item literacy screening question); four questions about which product had been purchased, from where and for what purpose, as well as the age(s) of the child(ren) for whom the products had been purchased; and seven product knowledge questions related to the safe administration of Nurofen® for Children (answers were available on the product packaging). To assist with answering the final two dosage related questions [If your child was 8 months old, what dose of Nurofen® for Childre n 1–5 years should you give?, and If your child weighed 20 kg, what dose of Nurofen® for Childre n 1–5 years should you give?], participants were provided with the information in Table 1.

Table 1

### An integrated safety analysis of combined acetaminophen and ibuprofen (maxigesic / combogesic) in adults [^112XeVQ3]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Multimodal analgesia has the potential to provide safe and effective management of postoperative pain. Combining oral analgesics into a single product potentially increases compliance, safety, and efficacy. The use of acetaminophen (APAP; N-acetyl-para-aminophenol or paracetamol) and/or ibuprofen (IBP) in postoperative pain management is well established internationally, often provided as an adjunct to opioid analgesia.–The current opioid crisis in the United States illustrates the immediate need for alternative or adjunct nonopioid analgesics with improved safety profiles. Opioid use can lead to addiction, with users developing a compulsive need to continue taking opioids despite negative consequences. Many opioid abusers begin their addiction through prescriptions for the treatment of postoperative pain. More than 40% of all opioid deaths in the United States involve prescription opioids. More than 75% of people misusing prescription opioids receive excess medication prescribed to friends or relatives. Other countries, such as Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and the UK, have also seen increases in the number opioid prescriptions and opioid-related deaths in recent years.

The combination of APAP and IBP is an effective alternative to opioid-based analgesia.–IBP is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with analgesic, antipyretic, and anti-inflammatory activities. A good tolerability profile along with extensive clinical experience has resulted in IBP being sold over-the-counter (OTC) in pharmacies worldwide, as well as in supermarkets and other general retailers. Approved indications include fever reduction and relief of minor aches and pains associated with the common cold, headache, toothache, muscular aches, backache, arthritis, and menstrual cramps.

Like other NSAIDs, IBP is believed to work by inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX), thus inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis. The COX family of enzymes is responsible for the metabolism of arachidonic acid to prostaglandin H2, an unstable molecule, which is in turn converted to numerous other pro-inflammatory compounds. There are at least two COX isoforms, designated as COX-1 and COX-2. IBP inhibits both isoforms nonselectively. Its desired activities are principally due to COX-2 inhibition, while its unwanted side effects on platelet aggregation and the gastrointestinal (GI) mucosa are due to COX-1 inhibition. The activity of the COX enzyme relies on being in the oxidized form. It has been shown that APAP can reduce the oxidized form of the COX enzyme in low peroxide environments such as the central nervous system, but not in peripheral immune cells.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Carefully consider the potential benefits and risks of ibuprofen tablets and other treatment options before deciding to use ibuprofen tablets. Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals (see WARNINGS).

After observing the response to initial therapy with ibuprofen tablets, the dose and frequency should be adjusted to suit an individual patient's needs. Do not exceed 3200 mg total daily dose. If gastrointestinal complaints occur, administer ibuprofen tablets with meals or milk.

Rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis, including flare-ups of chronic disease

Suggested Dosage: 1200 mg to 3200 mg daily (400 mg, 600 mg or 800 mg tid or qid). Individual patients may show a better response to 3200 mg daily, as compared with 2400 mg, although in well-controlled clinical trials patients on 3200 mg did not show a better mean response in terms of efficacy. Therefore, when treating patients with 3200 mg/day, the physician should observe sufficient increased clinical benefits to offset potential increased risk.

The dose should be tailored to each patient, and may be lowered or raised depending on the severity of symptoms either at time of initiating drug therapy or as the patient responds or fails to respond.

In general, patients with rheumatoid arthritis seem to require higher doses of ibuprofen tablets than do patients with osteoarthritis.

The smallest dose of ibuprofen tablets that yields acceptable control should be employed. A linear blood level dose response relationship exists with single doses up to 800 mg (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY for effects of food on rate of absorption).

The availability of three tablet strengths facilitates dosage adjustment.

In chronic conditions, a therapeutic response to therapy with ibuprofen tablets is sometimes seen in a few days to a week but most often is observed by two weeks. After a satisfactory response has been achieved, the patient's dose should be reviewed and adjusted as required.

Mild to moderate pain: 400 mg every 4 to 6 hours as necessary for relief of pain.

In controlled analgesic clinical trials, doses of ibuprofen tablets greater than 400 mg were no more effective than the 400 mg dose.

Dysmenorrhea

For the treatment of dysmenorrhea, beginning with the earliest onset of such pain, ibuprofen tablets should be given in a dose of 400 mg every 4 hours as necessary for the relief of pain.

### Medication education for dosing safety: a randomized controlled trial [^114RU4rP]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Study Objective

This study sought to determine whether a brief intervention at the time of emergency department (ED) discharge can improve safe dosing of liquid acetaminophen and ibuprofen by parents or guardians.

Methods

We performed a randomized controlled trial in the ED of parents and guardians of children 90 days to 11.9 years of age who were discharged with acetaminophen or ibuprofen, or both. Families were randomized to standard care or a teaching intervention combining lay language, simplified handouts, provision of an unmarked dosing syringe, and teach-back to confirm correct dosing. Participants were called 48 to 72 hours and 5 to 7 days after ED discharge to assess understanding of correct dosing. The primary outcome was defined as parent or guardian report of safe dosing at the time of first follow-up call. Our primary hypothesis was that the intervention would decrease the rate of error from 30% to 10% at 48- to 72-hour follow-up.

Results

We enrolled 149 of 259 (58%) eligible subjects; 97 of 149 (65%) were reached at first follow-up call, of whom 35 of 97 (36%) received the intervention. Among those participants receiving the intervention, 25 of 35 (71%) were able to identify a safe dose for their child at the time of the first call compared with 28 of 62 (45%) of those in the control arm. The difference in proportions was 26% (95% confidence interval [CI] 7% to 46%). There was a 58% increase in reporting safe dosing in the intervention group compared with the control roup (relative risk 1.58; 95% CI 1.12 to 2.24), and it remained significant after adjustment for health literacy and language (adjusted relative risk 1.50; 95% CI 1.06 to 2.13).

Conclusions

A multifaceted intervention at the time of ED discharge-consisting of a simplified dosing handout, a teaching session, teach-back, and provision of a standardized dosing device-can improve parents' knowledge of safe dosing of liquid medications at 48 to 72 hours.

### Liver enzyme elevations inVolunteer infection studies: findings and recommendations [^117HogqF]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

Control group and comparable data from Phase I studies.

A control arm, including either placebo or a registered antimalarial, would allow assessment of drug-dependent ALT/AST elevations versus those caused by model conditions. Although a control group increases costs, potential delays in drug development while investigating elevated ALT/AST values are also costly. It may be possible to use an historical control group with a marketed antimalarial or placebo/rescue medication where all other covariates (inoculum size, treatment day, and concomitant medications) are equivalent. It would also be valuable to ensure that VIS design is comparable with the Phase I first-in-human study in terms of dose regimen and patient population. Thus, any liver signals from the VISs can be interpreted relative to similar participants who are not infected with malaria.

Control parasitemia levels at treatment administration.

Although a threshold value has yet to be established, limiting parasitemia levels to < 10,000 parasites/mL blood would be precautionary. The feasibility of initiating NCE treatment at a predefined parasitemia threshold should be explored. Further work is needed to understand whether specific inflammatory/immune markers and/or malaria clinical score could be used to predict liver stress and integrated into a treatment decision tree. Parasite clearance kinetics for individual drugs, that is, fast or slow acting, could also influence the hepatic response to parasite clearance, and this requires further investigation.

Symptomatic treatment with ibuprofen rather than acetaminophen.

Owing to the known effects of acetaminophen and adducts on hepatocytes, ibuprofen is suggested as an alternative for managing malaria symptoms after inoculation. Treatment with ibuprofen is more effective than acetaminophen in lowering temperatures in malaria patients throughout the first 4.5 hours after dosing. Ibuprofen can be safely administered to healthy participants in a fasted state without increased risk of gastrointestinal toxicity. Alanine aminotransferase elevations can occur with ibuprofen doses of 2.4–3.2 g daily, but are generally mild. However, potential adverse effects, such as the known association of NSAIDs with acute kidney injury, requires specific evaluation in VISs.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Carefully consider the potential benefits and risks of ibuprofen oral suspension and other treatment options before deciding to use ibuprofen oral suspension. Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals (see WARNINGS).

After observing the response to initial therapy with ibuprofen oral suspension, the dose and frequency should be adjusted to suit an individual patient's needs.

Pediatric Patients

Fever Reduction: For reduction of fever in children, 6 months up to 2 years of age, the dosage should be adjusted on the basis of the initial temperature level (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY). The recommended dose is 5 mg/kg if the baseline temperature is less than 102.5ºF, or 10 mg/kg if the baseline temperature is 102.5ºF or greater. The duration of fever reduction is generally 6 to 8 hours. The recommended maximum daily dose is 40 mg/kg.

Analgesia: For relief of mild to moderate pain in children 6 months up to 2 years of age, the recommended dosage is 10 mg/kg, every 6 to 8 hours. The recommended maximum daily dose is 40 mg/kg. Doses should be given so as not to disturb the child's sleep pattern.

Juvenile Arthritis: The recommended dose is 30 mg/kg/day to 40 mg/kg/day divided into three to four doses (see Individualization of Dosage). Patients with milder disease may be adequately treated with 20 mg/kg/day.

### Ibuprofen prescription following adult tonsillectomy reduces postoperative opioid use [^114tMzgA]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Based on a 2018 American Academy of Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery survey, an average of 37 tablets of opioid medication, or about a week's worth of medication, were prescribed after adult tonsillectomy. Nearly 15% of patients will still be taking opioids one year after an initial weeklong prescription, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications have traditionally been avoided in adult tonsillectomy patients due to concern for increased bleeding risk from platelet dysfunction, despite little evidence supporting this claim. This study sought to demonstrate that ibuprofen prescriptions after tonsillectomy could be a safe and effective way to reduce postoperative opioid use.

Methods

This study was a retrospective chart review of patients undergoing tonsillectomy with one surgeon over three years. Half of the patients received a prescription for postoperative opioid medications and were counseled against taking ibuprofen. The other half of patients were prescribed ibuprofen following surgery and only provided with opioid analgesia as a rescue medication. The New Mexico Prescription Monitoring System was used to verify opioid prescriptions. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression were used to analyze the data.

Results

Ninety-nine patients were included in analysis, with 53 in the first group that did not receive ibuprofen and 46 in the second group that did receive ibuprofen. There was no difference in the bleeding rate between the two groups. Significantly fewer patients in the ibuprofen group filled postoperative opioid prescriptions when compared to the group that did not receive ibuprofen (40% vs. 96.2%, p < 0.0001, OR = 0.02).

Conclusion

Ibuprofen is a safe and effective analgesic following adult tonsillectomy and significantly reduces the proportion of patients who must fill a postoperative opioid prescription.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of acute pain in austere environments: 2024 update [^115rDGgN]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) — adult and pediatric dosing and analgesic ceiling — Studies of multiple NSAIDs have suggested an analgesic ceiling at submaximal doses — for example, 400 mg PO for ibuprofen. The recommended analgesic dose of ibuprofen is 200–400 mg as needed every 6 h PO for adults or 5–10 mg/kg for children, and in short-term applications an ibuprofen dose of 1200 mg/day or less has been shown to lead to no further adverse GI effects than placebo in otherwise healthy patients. For naproxen, recommended analgesic dosing is generally a 550 mg loading dose, followed by 250 mg every 12 h PO for adults, and 5 mg/kg every 12 h for children (maximum 10 mg/kg/d). Meloxicam is another PO NSAID notable for austere use in that its recommended analgesic dosing for adults is 7.5–15 mg PO as needed only once daily. Ketorolac is an NSAID that is available PO and in a parenteral form, given IV or IM; doses for adults are 15 mg IV or 30 mg IM every 6 h.

### An integrated safety analysis of combined acetaminophen and ibuprofen (maxigesic / combogesic) in adults [^114g9Jru]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Plain language summary

The combined use of acetaminophen (APAP) and ibuprofen (IBP) for pain management has many potential benefits over other pharmaceutical treatments such as opioids (codeine, tramadol, oxycodone, morphine, etc). It has been shown previously that a combination of APAP and IBP fixed dose product provides increased pain relief compared with the individual components. There remains uncertainty over the safety of combining these products, in particular the use of IBP following surgery, due to the increased risk of postoperative bleeding which is common in drugs of this type (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs).

This paper examines the safety profile of a combination of APAP and IBP product using pooled clinical trial data. The clinical trials examined multiple doses in tablet form of the combination therapy. Patients were provided with the maximum recommended dose of either APAP alone, IBP alone, the combination, or a placebo tablet during the 24–48 hours following either dental or knee surgery.

Overall, the combination tablets are well tolerated. The safety profile was found to be the same as APAP or IBP when taken alone. Together, with the additional pain relief provided by the combination, this shows an improved and beneficial treatment that can be well tolerated following surgery.

### Clinical practice guideline: opioid prescribing for analgesia after common otolaryngology operations [^111CJ95p]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2021). High credibility.

Table 17 — patient frequently asked questions about opioids provides practical postoperative guidance: pain medication should be taken for severe pain as needed but only if pain is not controlled with nonopioid medication, and if opioids are needed for severe pain, take as prescribed on the medication's bottle. Dose amounts should follow the instructions on the bottle or ones given by your health care provider. For co-medication, probably yes to using Tylenol, aspirin, or Advil instead or with this medication, but check with your health care provider; some prescribed pain medications combine acetaminophen with opioids, and taking additional acetaminophen with the prescribed combination pain medication could be unsafe. Patients do not need to finish the entire bottle; pain medication should be taken when needed and must be stopped when pain is controlled, and if severe pain is under control, there is no need to finish the bottle. Leftover pills should not be left in the home where someone else can access them, and there are facilities that will take these leftover medications. Medications should never be shared with a family member or anyone else, and if pills are left over patients should check with their health care provider or take them to a facility that will dispose of them safely.

### Hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen [^113MRRNL]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Strategies to Minimize the GI Risks in NSAID-treated patients:

- Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest possible duration.

- Avoid administration of more than one NSAID at a time.

- Avoid use in patients at higher risk unless benefits are expected to outweigh the increased risk of bleeding. For high risk patients, as well as those with active GI bleeding, consider alternate therapies other than NSAIDs.

- Remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy.

- If a serious GI adverse event is suspected, promptly initiate evaluation and treatment, and discontinue hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen tablets until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out.

- In the setting of concomitant use of low-dose aspirin for cardiac prophylaxis, monitor patients more closely for evidence of GI bleeding (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions).

Hepatotoxicity

Elevations of ALT or AST (three or more times the upper limit of normal [ULN]) have been reported in approximately 1% of NSAID-treated patients in clinical trials with NSAIDS. In addition, rare, sometimes fatal, cases of severe hepatic injury, including fulminant hepatitis, liver necrosis, and hepatic failure have been reported.

Elevations of ALT or AST (less than three times ULN) may occur in up to 15% of patients taking NSAIDs including ibuprofen.

### NSAID prescribing precautions [^117PB77c]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are commonly used, but have risks associated with their use, including significant upper gastrointestinal tract bleeding. Older persons, persons taking anticoagulants, and persons with a history of upper gastrointestinal tract bleeding associated with NSAIDs are at especially high risk. Although aspirin is cardioprotective, other NSAIDs can worsen congestive heart failure, can increase blood pressure, and are related to adverse cardiovascular events, such as myocardial infarction and ischemia. Cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors have been associated with increased risk of myocardial infarction; however, the only cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor still available in the United States, celecoxib, seems to be safer in this regard. Hepatic damage from NSAIDs is rare, but these medications should not be used in persons with cirrhotic liver diseases because bleeding problems and renal failure are more likely. Care should be used when prescribing NSAIDs in persons taking anticoagulants and in those with platelet dysfunction, as well as immediately before surgery. Potential central nervous system effects include aseptic meningitis, psychosis, and tinnitus. Asthma may be induced or exacerbated by NSAIDs. Although most NSAIDs are likely safe in pregnancy, they should be avoided in the last six to eight weeks of pregnancy to prevent prolonged gestation from inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis, premature closure of the ductus arteriosus, and maternal and fetal complications from antiplatelet activity. Ibuprofen, indomethacin, and naproxen are safe in breastfeeding women. Care should be taken to prevent accidental NSAID overdose in children by educating parents about correct dosing and storage in childproof containers.

### Combined acetaminophen and ibuprofen for pain relief after oral surgery in adults: a randomized controlled trial [^114tU84b]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2010). Low credibility.

The relief of pain has been described as a universal human right but is not always easily achieved. Opioid analgesics are effective, but have troublesome and potentially dangerous side-effects, and their potential for abuse may lead to regulatory and logistical difficulties. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have fewer regulatory restrictions, but they too have important adverse effects which are more likely at higher dose or with longer courses. Acetaminophen is widely used and is very safe at the recommended dose of 4 g per day, but does not always provide adequate pain relief on its own. Combining analgesics offers the possibility of increasing effectiveness without increasing dose (and therefore risk).NSAIDs are often combined with acetaminophen, particularly for treating postoperative pain. –

Prescribing acetaminophen and ibuprofen together is common in clinical practice. – Ibuprofen has the advantage of a well-established safety record (particularly at doses below 1.5 g per day in adults), and in many countries (including the UK), it is available without prescription. Typically, acetaminophen is given in a dose regimen of 1 g 6 hourly whereas ibuprofen is given in a dose of 400 mg 8 hourly. Compliance with the prescribed dosing regimen is important for achieving the desired result with any drug and is often poor with asynchronous dosing. A single formulation with a simplified regimen would probably be appreciated by patients and might improve compliance.

Maxigesic ® is a new formulation of acetaminophen 500 mg and ibuprofen 150 mg. Taking two tablets 6 hourly provides the appropriate daily dose of both drugs relatively simply. We have investigated the hypothesis that in adult patients undergoing a common surgical procedure (extraction of third molar teeth), this formulation provides superior analgesia to either of its components alone.

### Novel immediate / sustained-release formulation of acetaminophen-ibuprofen combination (paxerol ®) for severe nocturia associated with overactive bladder: a multi-center, randomized, double blinded, placebo-controlled, 4-arm trial [^115zJwWj]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2019). Medium credibility.

4.1 Paxerol designed specifically for nocturia

Paxerol is a novel proprietary IR/SR (50%:50%) formulation of PG inhibitors (acetaminophen and ibuprofen). Inhibition of the PG pathway is expected to alleviate nocturia because PGs are local modulators of reflex micturition, increase detrusor muscle tone, enhance micturition, 10 and inhibit antidiuretic hormone. 11 One‐half of the drugs is released via IR during the first hour to provide "loading dose" effect. The other half is released via SR for up to 6 h to coincide with the normal 6‐8 h of sleep. This low‐dose IR/SR dosage form is unlike the modified‐release formulations of acetaminophen and/or ibuprofen, which are high‐dose prolonged release formulations. The acetaminophen‐containing modified release formulations were suspended from marketing by the European Union regulatory agencies in 2017 due to safety concerns for providing uninterrupted steady presence of high dose of acetaminophen in the body for a very prolonged time period.

Patients could take Over‐the‐Counter (OTC) products (eg, Tylenol and an Advil) at bedtime to have initial attenuation of nocturia during early bedtime. However, due to the short half‐life of approximately 2 h, these agents are not able to provide benefit for 6‐8 h of normal sleep duration. Furthermore, OTC drugs are packaged at doses suitable for analgesia and anti‐inflammation, which are beyond the dose for nocturia (∼3× and ∼4×, respectively, higher than Paxerol). Long‐term exposure to OTC dose levels increase risks of cardiovascular and GI toxicities with ibuprofen, and hepatotoxicity secondary to inadvertent overdose with acetaminophen. They are not suitable for treatment of a chronic condition like nocturia, which is consistent with the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence guidelines of not recommending NSAIDs for nocturia. The toxicity risks with chronic use may be one of the reasons that the work of NSAIDs on nocturia did not result in NSAID products for nocturia. Paxerol is different from OTC products for analgesia or anti‐inflammation. Paxerol contains only ∼6% and ∼8%, respectively, of maximum OTC doses, and release from Paxerol tablets lasts over 6 h. Toxicity risks associated with chronic use should be minimal.

### Alternating ibuprofen and acetaminophen in the treatment of febrile children: a pilot study [^112jwmmw]. BMC Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Implications for practice

Despite the effectiveness of the combined antipyretic regimen shown in this study, we emphasize that our findings should not be used as a justification for advising this practice. The duration of our study was a short 8 hour interval, during which a single dose of ibuprofen and acetaminophen was administered. Although no renal, hepatic or gastrointestinal adverse effects were observed, no definite conclusions on the safety of the combined antipyretic treatment can be made before larger multi-dose clinical trials are conducted demonstrating its safety. In addition, the antipyretic advantage of the combined antipyretics may be attenuated with multiple dosing of ibuprofen and acetaminophen, and become comparable to repeated ibuprofen mono-therapy. A similar situation has been reported by Walson et al. where multi-dose treatments with 2.5 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg ibuprofen for 24–48 hours resulted in equivalent antipyresis to 10 mg/kg ibuprofen or 15 mg/kg acetaminophen, after the second dose and continuing to 24–48 hours later.

### Comparison of acetaminophen (paracetamol) with ibuprofen for treatment of fever or pain in children younger than 2 years: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113cjFX2]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Acetaminophen (paracetamol) and ibuprofen are the most widely prescribed and available over-the-counter medications for management of fever and pain in children. Data from a prospective cohort of 6476 children followed from birthsuggest that as many as 95% of children are exposed to acetaminophen by age 9 months. Despite the common use of these medications, treatment recommendations for young children remain divergent, especially among those younger than 6 months. While acetaminophen is uniformly recommended across countries for use from the neonatal period, the maximum daily dose beyond the neonatal period varies from 60 mg/kg/d in New Zealandand the United Kingdomto 90 mg/kg/d in the United States. Recommendations for ibuprofen use for the treatment of fever and pain in young children are considerably more variable. The New Zealand Formulary for Children, based on the British National Formulary for Children, recommends ibuprofen use from age 1 month at 5 mg/kg/dose, 3 to 4 times daily, to a maximum dose of 30 mg/kg/d. In contrast, in the United States, ibuprofen use is only recommended for children aged at least 6 months, with a higher maximum daily dose of 40 mg/kg/d.

Several authors caution against the use of ibuprofen in younger infants, citing a higher risk of acute kidney injury, particularly in the context of dehydration. Epidemiological studies conducted in North America, the United Kingdom, and Europe suggest that ibuprofen may play a role in the development of serious bacterial infection. Case-control and prospective cohort studies have shown a 2-fold to 5-fold increase in the odds of developing soft tissue infection with ibuprofen use in the context of primary varicella infection, and a similar increase in the odds of developing empyema with ibuprofen use during treatment of community-acquired pneumonia. Although acetaminophen is often considered first-line in the treatment of fever and pain in children because its safety is perceived to be more assured, there is growing evidence suggesting acetaminophen use in children is associated with an increased risk of developing asthma and related atopic disease. Data regarding the risks of acetaminophen or ibuprofen in young children are often incorporated in studies across the pediatric age spectrum, but specific literature concerning the risk of serious adverse events (SAEs) and systematic reviews of efficacy and safety in children younger than 2 years, particularly in infants younger than 6 months, are lacking.

WARNING: HEPATOTOXICITY, CARDIOVASCULAR RISK, and GASTROINTESTINAL RISK See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning.
- Take care when prescribing, preparing, and administering COMBOGESIC IV to avoid dosing errors which could result in accidental overdose and death. (5.1)
- COMBOGESIC IV contains acetaminophen, which has been associated with cases of acute liver failure, at times resulting in liver transplant and death. Most of the cases of liver injury are associated with doses of acetaminophen that exceed 4000 mg per day, and often involve more than one acetaminophen-containing product. (5.2)
- Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), like the ibuprofen in COMBOGESIC IV, may cause an increased risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction and stroke, which can be fatal. This risk may occur early in treatment and may increase with duration of use. (5.3).
- COMBOGESIC IV is contraindicated in the setting of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. (4, 5.3)
- NSAIDS, like the ibuprofen in COMBOGESIC IV, cause an increased risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events, including bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach or intestines, which can be fatal. These events can occur at any time during use and without warning symptoms. Elderly patients and patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding are at greater risk for serious GI events. (5.4)

### Safe prescribing of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in patients with osteoarthritis – an expert consensus addressing benefits as well as gastrointestinal and cardiovascular risks [^112GEcqT]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Ns-NSAIDs, being COX-1-inhibitors, all impair thromboxane A 2 synthesis and, as a consequence, platelet aggregation, although the magnitude and duration of this effect varies amongst the different compounds. With the exception of diclofenac and meloxicam, almost all ns-NSAIDs can interfere with the anti-aggregant effect of aspirin.

While the pharmacodynamic, negative interaction between ns-NSAIDs and low-dose aspirin has been clearly established by studies in healthy volunteers and patients, the clinical consequences of such interaction are still not definitely ascertained. Indeed, available epidemiological studies provided conflicting results, with only three out of six reports showing a reduction of the cardio-protective effect of aspirin. However, the few RCTs available are consistent in their findings that ns-NSAID use does worsen the CV outcome in patients taking low-dose aspirin. Indeed, in the Physicians' Health Study, the regular use of these agents was associated with an increased risk (RR, 2.86; 95% CI, 1.25–6.56) of acute recurrent myocardial infarction. Similarly, in the Therapeutic Arthritis Research and Gastrointestinal Event Trial (TARGET), designed to assess the GI and CV safety of lumiracoxib versus naproxen and ibuprofen, a post hoc subgroup analysis of high CV risk patients (n = 3,042) taking low-dose aspirin (60%) found a higher CV event rate in ibuprofen users compared to lumiracoxib users (1.48 versus 0.85 events per 100 patient/years). Besides the CV harm, concomitant administration of ns-NSAIDs and low-dose aspirin can be followed by stroke recurrence in patients with prior cerebrovascular events.

4 HOW TO MANAGE PATIENTS WITH T2D AND ADVANCED CKD

The following case studies provide a clinical context and practical guidance for the use of incretin therapies as glucose‐lowering agents in patients with T2D and advanced CKD.

4.1

4.1.1 Case 1: Advanced CKD

A 66‐year‐old man with T2D was referred for assessment of glucose‐lowering therapy following worsening glycaemic control, symptomatic hypoglycaemia 2–3 times per week, and progression to severe CKD. The patient reported an increasingly sedentary lifestyle because of reduced physical activity following retirement, and worsening back and joint pain. He had a 15‐year history of T2D, in addition to hypertension, osteoarthritis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. His current medication regimen was glipizide extended‐release 10 mg once‐daily; ramipril 5 mg twice‐daily; and over‐the‐counter ibuprofen 200 mg taken three times daily. Key clinical data: blood pressure (BP) 139/77 mmHg, body mass index (BMI) 31.1 kg/m 2, HbA1c 7.8%, fasting plasma glucose 151 mg/dL, eGFR 29 mL/min/1.73m 2, UACR 220 mg/g, blood urea nitrogen 50 mg/mL, serum creatinine 2.3 mg/dL. The patient's glucose‐lowering therapy was changed to dulaglutide 1.5 mg weekly instead of glipizide, with the instruction to discontinue ibuprofen because of potential nephrotoxicity; the ramipril dose was unchanged. The patient was also advised to increase physical activity. After 6 months, HbA1c had fallen to 7.2%, eGFR was stable at 30 mL/min/1.73m 2, UACR decreased to 50 mg/g, BP had fallen to 134/74 mmHg, and BMI was reduced to 29.3 kg/m 2. He reported no symptoms of hypoglycaemia.

4.1.2 Take home message

In patients with T2D and advanced CKD, hyperglycaemia can be safely and effectively managed by a GLP‐1 RA with stabilization of kidney function and reduction of albuminuria, along with improvements in CVD risk factors such as hypertension and obesity.

### Ibuprofen arginate for rapid-onset pain relief in daily practice: a review of its use in different pain conditions [^117CSBu1]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Despite the availability of effective pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches, the management of pain remains inadequate across different treatment settings, with a substantial proportion of patients continuing to experience pain of mild to moderate intensity. Inadequately managed acute pain has a negative impact on numerous aspects of patient´s health and may increase the risk of developing chronic pain. Physicians commonly encounter challenging acute pain scenarios, with key decisional dilemmas regarding the selection of medicines to provide adequate pain relief in order to facilitate recovery, improve function and quality of life, as well as minimizing adverse effects and the need of prescribing of opioids. On the other hand, it has been demonstrated some shortcomings in physicians' knowledge about the optimal treatment and expected time course for acute pain conditions presenting to the primary care setting.

The use of prescribed and, in particular, over-the-counter (OTC) analgesics is very common at population level, and different studies have shown overall prevalences ranging between 8.5% for daily analgesic use, 13.6% a few times a week, 47% once a week, and 76% once a month. Ibuprofen was the first non-aspirin non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) to be approved for OTC use and is widely considered to be the best tolerated drug of its class. Low-dose, OTC ibuprofen has been used for pain relief for over 30 years without any obvious major health issues. In a systematic review of 39 Cochrane reviews of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that had examined the analgesic efficacy of drug interventions in the postoperative pain model, fast-acting formulations of ibuprofen 200 and 400 mg showed values of the number needed to treat (NNT) close to 2 for the outcome of at least 50% pain relief over 4–6 hours compared to placebo. Ibuprofen was also more favorable than paracetamol and aspirin at various doses with NTT values of 3 and above.

### An integrated safety analysis of combined acetaminophen and ibuprofen (maxigesic / combogesic) in adults [^116DTuCc]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

APAP and IBP are two analgesic compounds with a long history of use, and both are considered safe and well tolerated at maximum recommended OTC daily doses. The major safety risks of APAP (hepatic injury) and IBP (gastric bleeding and thromboembolic) are largely related to dose. Using a combination addresses these risks by providing superior analgesia without transgressing daily OTC dose limits. Combinations containing APAP and IBP are beneficial as there is less opportunity for drug interactions due to their distinct metabolic pathways. Providing an FDC without an opioid also limits the risk of overdosing, as patients attempt to increase their opioid intake due to tolerance and dependence.

Clinical safety data obtained from clinical trials with both the FDC 325/97.5 and the FDC 500/150 demonstrate the safety and tolerability of an FDC of APAP and IBP at or below maximum OTC daily doses of 4,000 mg, and in the case of IBP, well below maximum daily dose of 2,400 mg. This is supported by safety data from a variety of FDC formulations reported previously, including a large meta-analysis of the literature. When taken at full doses, the cumulative daily consumption of APAP and IBP from the FDC 325/97.5 is 97.5% of that from the FDC 500/150. This permitted the pooling of data for the analysis of safety. Among a pooled safety population of 922 patients, 521 AEs were reported. Data from these 922 subjects demonstrated that the superior analgesic efficacy obtained by combining APAP and IBP did not come at the expense of safety or tolerability. During the double-blind period (24–48 hours), treatment with the FDC did not increase the incidence of AEs, discontinuations due to AEs, or the proportion of subjects experiencing at least one AE relative to either monotherapy group or placebo. There was no increase in the percentage of AEs deemed possibly or probably related to the study medication. The FDC did not differ in the percentage of AEs rated as severe. The incidence of common AEs was also unchanged. The FDC did not alter the rates of GI AEs or postoperative bleeding compared with either monotherapy or placebo. There were also no appreciable changes to hemoglobin and liver biochemistry levels compared to the APAP monotherapy during the open-label phase of one study (AFT-MX-6E). The additional analgesia provided by the FDC does not come at the cost of a reduction in tolerability. The FDC provides a well tolerated and effective means of analgesia for mild–moderate pain, which can be used as an alternative or adjunct to opioid use post surgery.

### An integrated safety analysis of intravenous ibuprofen (caldolor (®)) in adults [^111po8bW]. Journal of Pain Research (2015). Low credibility.

Intravenous (IV) nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as IV ibuprofen are increasingly used as a component of multimodal pain management in the inpatient and outpatient settings. The safety of IV ibuprofen as assessed in ten sponsored clinical studies is presented in this analysis. Overall, 1,752 adult patients have been included in safety and efficacy trials over 11 years; 1,220 of these patients have received IV ibuprofen and 532 received either placebo or comparator medication. The incidence of adverse events (AEs), serious AEs, and changes in vital signs and clinically significant laboratory parameters have been summarized and compared to patients receiving placebo or active comparator drug. Overall, IV ibuprofen has been well tolerated by hospitalized and outpatient patients when administered both prior to surgery and postoperatively as well as for nonsurgical pain or fever. The overall incidence of AEs is lower in patients receiving IV ibuprofen as compared to those receiving placebo in this integrated analysis. Specific analysis of hematological and renal effects showed no increased risk for patients receiving IV ibuprofen. A subset analysis of elderly patients suggests that no dose adjustment is needed in this higher risk population. This integrated safety analysis demonstrates that IV ibuprofen can be safely administered prior to surgery and continued in the postoperative period as a component of multimodal pain management.

2.1 Important Dosage and Administration Instructions

- Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

- Do not exceed the maximum total daily dose of COMBOGESIC IV (4,000 mg acetaminophen and 1,200 mg ibuprofen) in 24 hours.

- Do not exceed a total daily dose of 4,000 mg (4 g) acetaminophen from all sources.

- Do not co-administer COMBOGESIC IV with other acetaminophen or ibuprofen containing products [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

- Visually inspect for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. If visibly opaque particles, discoloration, or other foreign particulates are observed, do not use.

- Use COMBOGESIC IV in one patient on one occasion only. It contains no antimicrobial preservative. Discard any unused solution.

- Do not mix with diluents or with other medicines.

2.2 Recommended Dosage

For adult patients weighing greater than or equal to 50 kg (actual body weight): The recommended dosage of COMBOGESIC IV is one vial (100 mL; acetaminophen 1,000 mg/ibuprofen 300 mg) administered as a 15-minute infusion every 6 hours, as necessary.

For adult patients weighing less than 50 kg (actual body weight): The recommended dosage is 15 mg/kg acetaminophen and 4.5 mg/kg ibuprofen, administered as a 15-minute infusion every 6 hours, as necessary. This equates to a maximum single dose of 750 mg acetaminophen and 225 mg ibuprofen (discard remaining medicine in vial), and a total daily dose of 3,000 mg (3 g) acetaminophen and 900 mg ibuprofen.

OVERDOSAGE

Approximately 1½ hours after the reported ingestion of from 7 to 10 ibuprofen tablets (400 mg), a 19-month old child weighing 12 kg was seen in the hospital emergency room, apneic and cyanotic, responding only to painful stimuli. This type of stimulus, however, was sufficient to induce respiration. Oxygen and parenteral fluids were given; a greenish-yellow fluid was aspirated from the stomach with no evidence to indicate the presence of ibuprofen. Two hours after ingestion the child's condition seemed stable; she still responded only to painful stimuli and continued to have periods of apnea lasting from 5 to 10 seconds. She was admitted to intensive care and sodium bicarbonate was administered as well as infusions of dextrose and normal saline. By four hours post-ingestion she could be aroused easily, sit by herself and respond to spoken commands. Blood level of ibuprofen was 102.9 mcg/mL approximately 8½ hours after accidental ingestion. At 12 hours she appeared to be completely recovered.

In two other reported cases where children (each weighing approximately 10 kg) accidentally, acutely ingested approximately 120 mg/kg, there were no signs of acute intoxication or late sequelae. Blood level in one child 90 minutes after ingestion was 700 mcg/mL — about 10 times the peak levels seen in absorption-excretion studies.

A 19-year old male who had taken 8,000 mg of ibuprofen over a period of a few hours complained of dizziness, and nystagmus was noted. After hospitalization, parenteral hydration and three days bed rest, he recovered with no reported sequelae.

In cases of acute overdosage, the stomach should be emptied by vomiting or lavage, though little drug will likely be recovered if more than an hour has elapsed since ingestion. Because the drug is acidic and is excreted in the urine, it is theoretically beneficial to administer alkali and induce diuresis. In addition to supportive measures, the use of oral activated charcoal may help to reduce the absorption and reabsorption of ibuprofen tablets.

NSAIDs — use as first-line therapy, dosing strategy, and contraindications in austere environments — Recommendation: We recommend NSAIDs as an effective class of analgesic agents that should be employed as a first-line treatment for mild to severe pain in the austere environment in the absence of contraindications. Recommendation: We recommend that treatment strategies with NSAIDs should employ the lowest effective dose for the shortest possible duration to minimize adverse effects. Recommendation: We recommend that NSAIDs should not be used with known renal dysfunction, pregnancy, history of bariatric surgery, and/or history of GI bleeding. Topical NSAIDs, though proven to be effective analgesics, have a limited role in the treatment of significant injury in austere environments, given the increased weight, bulk, and limited stability of these preparations.

### Fatality after deliberate ingestion of sustained-release ibuprofen: a case report [^115dvLKL]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Introduction

Ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) commonly used as an analgesic, as an anti-inflammatory agent and as an anti-pyretic agent. The predominant pharmacological action of ibuprofen is to inhibit the activity of cyclooxygenase, an enzyme crucial for the synthesis of prostaglandins. The subsequent inhibition of prostaglandin production leads to a reduction in inflammation, temperature and pain, both centrally and peripherally. Ibuprofen is manufactured and marketed as a 'normal' release preparation at a dose of 400 mg three times a day or a sustained-release preparation at a dose of 800–1600 mg once a day. In the United Kingdom the 'normal'-release preparation is available on general sales licence, pharmacy and prescription, but the sustained-release preparation is available only as a 'prescription only medication'.

There have been only nine previously reported fatalities following ibuprofen intoxication, although in eight of these cases other co-existent factors have probably contributed to death. We report here the first case report of a fatality following isolated ingestion of sustained-release ibuprofen that did not respond to maximal supportive care with ante mortem and post mortem ibuprofen concentrations.

### Is acetaminophen safe in pregnancy? [^115H8fQE]. Scandinavian Journal of Pain (2017). Medium credibility.

American College of Medical Toxicology (ACMT) — acetaminophen use in pregnancy — is affirmed as safe, stating that acetaminophen is safe and effective when taken as intended and, because of its safety profile and absence of teratogenic effects, it has been considered the medication of choice for fever and pain relief during pregnancy. ACMT affirms the safety of acetaminophen in pregnancy and calls for an evidence-based approach to the search for causes and treatment of autism. Regarding autism risk, multiple studies have investigated the association between acetaminophen and autism but have failed to find a causal effect, and larger, more sophisticated studies, including a study of siblings in the same family, demonstrated no increased risk in children exposed to acetaminophen. The statement cautions that raising concerns about acetaminophen use in pregnancy without strong supporting evidence may discourage care for maternal fever, which is known to pose significant fetal risk on its own, and notes that untreated maternal pain can also lead to morbidity. It further warns that patients may turn to alternatives such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories and opioids, both of which can clearly cause harm to the developing fetus and newborn.

### Ibuprofen, paracetamol, and steam for patients with respiratory tract infections in primary care: pragmatic randomised factorial trial [^112xhFGr]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To assess strategies for advice on analgesia and steam inhalation for respiratory tract infections.

Design

Open pragmatic parallel group factorial randomised controlled trial.

Setting

Primary care in United Kingdom.

Participants

Patients aged ≥ 3 with acute respiratory tract infections.

Intervention

889 patients were randomised with computer generated random numbers in pre-prepared sealed numbered envelopes to components of advice or comparator advice: advice on analgesia (take paracetamol, ibuprofen, or both), dosing of analgesia (take as required v regularly), and steam inhalation (no inhalation v steam inhalation).

Outcomes

Primary: mean symptom severity on days 2–4; symptoms rated 0 (no problem) to 7 (as bad as it can be). Secondary: temperature, antibiotic use, reconsultations.

Results

Neither advice on dosing nor on steam inhalation was significantly associated with changes in outcomes. Compared with paracetamol, symptom severity was little different with ibuprofen (adjusted difference 0.04, 95% confidence interval -0.11 to 0.19) or the combination of ibuprofen and paracetamol (0.11, -0.04 to 0.26). There was no evidence for selective benefit with ibuprofen among most subgroups defined before analysis (presence of otalgia; previous duration of symptoms; temperature > 37.5 °C; severe symptoms), but there was evidence of reduced symptoms severity benefit in the subgroup with chest infections (ibuprofen -0.40, -0.78 to -0.01; combination -0.47; -0.84 to -0.10), equivalent to almost one in two symptoms rated as a slight rather than a moderately bad problem. Children might also benefit from treatment with ibuprofen (ibuprofen: -0.47, -0.76 to -0.18; combination: -0.04, -0.31 to 0.23). Reconsultations with new/unresolved symptoms or complications were documented in 12% of those advised to take paracetamol, 20% of those advised to take ibuprofen (adjusted risk ratio 1.67, 1.12 to 2.38), and 17% of those advised to take the combination (1.49, 0.98 to 2.18). Mild thermal injury with steam was documented for four patients (2%) who returned full diaries, but no reconsultations with scalding were documented.

Conclusion

Overall advice to use steam inhalation, or ibuprofen rather than paracetamol, does not help control symptoms in patients with acute respiratory tract infections and must be balanced against the possible progression of symptoms during the next month for a minority of patients. Advice to use ibuprofen might help short term control of symptoms in those with chest infections and in children.

### The shortened infusion time of intravenous ibuprofen, part 2: a multicenter, open-label, surgical surveillance trial to evaluate safety [^115V8zPS]. Clinical Therapeutics (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

The literature and clinical data support the use of intravenous (IV) infusions of ibuprofen to control pain and reduce the opioid requirements associated with surgical pain. According to current guidelines, IV ibuprofen can be administered via a slow IV infusion performed during a 30-minute period. Although recent studies indicate that more rapid infusions may yield additional benefits for patients, the safety of such an approach needs further evaluation. The main purpose of this study was to determine the safety of single and multiple doses of IV ibuprofen (800 mg) administered over 5 to 10 minutes at the induction of anesthesia and after the surgical procedure for the treatment of postoperative pain.

Methods

This was a Phase IV, multicenter, open-label, clinical surveillance study. It was conducted at 21 hospitals in the United States, and 300 adult hospitalized patients undergoing surgery were enrolled. The exclusion criteria for the study were: inadequate IV access; hypersensitivity to any component of IV ibuprofen, aspirin, or related products; and any active, clinically significant bleeding. Also excluded were patients who had taken NSAIDs < 6 hours before administration of IV ibuprofen; pregnant or breastfeeding female patients; and patients in the perioperative period of coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Patients received 800 mg of IV ibuprofen administered over 5 to 10 minutes preoperatively. Vital signs, adverse events, and pain scores were assessed.

Findings

Approximately 22% (65 of 300) of patients reported adverse events (serious and nonserious). The most common adverse event was infusion site pain (34 of 300 [11%]). No deaths were reported. Nine subjects reported serious adverse events, 8 of which occurred during the first 6 hours. All serious events reported were judged unrelated to ibuprofen. Of the 300 total patients, 2 (0.67%) discontinued the study drug due to an adverse event (1 patient discontinued the study because of infusion site pain, and 1 patient withdrew due to a hypersensitivity reaction after drug administration).

Implications

Our study found that IV ibuprofen infused over 5 to 10 minutes at induction of anesthesia is a safe administration option for surgical patients. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01334957.

### Acetaminophen and ibuprofen (combogesic) [^116sBdPT]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

6 ADVERSE REACTIONS

The following clinically significant adverse reactions to ibuprofen or acetaminophen are described elsewhere in other sections of the labelling.

Hepatotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]
Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]
Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]
Hypertension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]
Heart Failure and Edema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]
Renal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]
Anaphylaxis and Other Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]
Serious Skin Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)]
Hematologic Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12)]

The most common adverse reactions (incidence of ≥ 2% for patients receiving COMBOGESIC) are: nausea, vomiting, headache, dizziness, somnolence, post-procedural hemorrhage, and swelling of the face (Table 1).

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of one drug cannot be directly compared to the rates reported from clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

The clinical trials of COMBOGESIC have been conducted in patients with postoperative pain following dental and arthroscopic procedures, who received double-blind treatment every 6 hours for 24 or 48 hours.

Most commonly (≥ 2%) reported adverse reactions by organ system during double-blind treatment are listed in the table below. Adverse reactions are closely related to the extent (the level and length) of exposure. The incidences of overall and individual adverse reactions reported during the double-blind treatment period did not suggest an increase of risks associated with short-term (up to one or two days) use of the combination drug, COMBOGESIC in comparison to each individual component, acetaminophen or ibuprofen, and to placebo.

6.2 Postmarketing Experience

The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of acetaminophen and ibuprofen. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

Skin and Appendages: Exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), and fixed drug eruption (FDE).

### Combined acetaminophen and ibuprofen for pain relief after oral surgery in adults: a randomized controlled trial [^117JN2t1]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2010). Low credibility.

The treatment of pain is central to medical practice in hospitals and in primary care. If these results are confirmed in other settings, the already widely used combination of acetaminophen and ibuprofen may become the standard of care for the initial management of moderate acute pain, at least for those patients who do not have contra-indications to NSAIDs. Even using the drugs individually, the dosage regimen studied here is simpler than that currently recommended, and may well improve compliance with and therefore success with this combination. Providing both drugs in one tablet simplifies this regimen even further, and our data confirm that the specific formulation studied here is effective, and that there is no interaction between its constituent drugs.

### Best practices guidelines for acute pain management in trauma patients [^115CA11j]. ACS (2020). High credibility.

Multimodal pain management — key points and patient counseling — emphasizes clear patient expectations, proactive assessment, scheduled nonopioid analgesics, and planned de-escalation. The page states to counsel patients that the goal of pain management is not eradication of all pain and to inform patients that pain is normal after trauma and surgery, medications are meant to alleviate but not remove pain entirely, and pain may increase as mobility increases. Key points include that patient education about expectations for management is a highly effective intervention for pain management, to promptly investigate the cause of increasing pain rather than responding by increasing the analgesic dose or adding new medications, to administer acetaminophen and ibuprofen "around-the-clock" to maintain a constant serum level, and to have a protocol for safe de-escalation of analgesics as quickly as possible. The page defines multimodal analgesia (MMA) as the use of multiple analgesics, regional analgesia, and nonpharmacologic interventions to affect peripheral and/or central nervous system loci in the pain pathway, and notes that the MMA concept may be applied across the care continuum with strategies suited to each phase of care.

### Paracetamol plus ibuprofen for the treatment of fever in children (PITCH): randomised controlled trial [^115HMhu5]. BMJ (2008). Excellent credibility.

The pragmatism of the intervention changed with time, moving from efficacy in the first four hours to effectiveness in the second 24 hours. By 48 hours, considerably fewer study drugs were being given and this could partly explain the observed lack of effects on discomfort at this time. In the community, paracetamol and ibuprofen are usually dosed by age, and we recognise that calculating doses by weight means the results may inform primary and secondary care practice more than practice at home. We decided against a dose by age regimen, however, for two reasons. Firstly, given the recommendation of the children's national service framework to dose by weightand the dose by weight presentations in the British national formulary for children, we believe that in the future more medicines for children will be given by weight. Secondly, we wanted to ensure that heavier children for their age received a therapeutic dose and to avoid exceeding the normal recommended dose for children who were light for their age. Comparing dose by weight with dose by age shows that children can receive as much as 50% moreor 50% less paracetamol and 100% more ibuprofen.

Medicine bottles in the United States contain dosing advice by both age and weight and although healthcare professionals can clearly calculate dose by weight, we think two steps are needed before parents can routinely use weight to determine dose in other countries. Firstly, studies should investigate the safety implications of any differences between estimates of children's weights measured by parents using domestic scales (or recently recorded weights in parent held children's health records) and those measured by professionals using paediatric scales. Secondly, suppliers of antipyretics could consider routinely including dose by weight tables. Given that the complexity of using two drugs over a 24 hour period is more likely to lead to inadvertently exceeding the maximum recommended dose, we also believe that multiple blank charts should be supplied for parents to record when medicines have been given and how much.

Clinical Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

We commend the retrospective subgroup analysis by Gan et al. for addressing a vital concern in geriatric pharmacotherapy-balancing analgesic efficacy with safety in older patients. Although their findings reinforce the utility of intravenous ibuprofen for acute postoperative pain, we offer further perspectives on patient selection, comorbid risk profiles, and polypharmacy, particularly in frail or polymorbid geriatric populations. This letter expands on practical and clinical considerations in translating these findings into real-world settings.

### Ibuprofen, paracetamol, and steam for patients with respiratory tract infections in primary care: pragmatic randomised factorial trial [^111rrUfW]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Results in context of other studies

There was no effect of either dosing advice or advice to inhale with steam on symptom severity — neither the estimates nor the lower confidence limits reached the defined level for clinical significance — and no intervention modified antibiotic use. Patients with uncomplicated lower respiratory infections were more likely to benefit from advice to use ibuprofen, and a recent trial showed that ibuprofen was as effective or possibly more effective than antibiotics (Carl Llor, personal communication). Children might also selectively benefit from ibuprofen. Those aged 17 and over had slightly worse symptom control with ibuprofen, although the effect was small and did not reach the threshold for clinical significance. We could not show superiority of the combined strategy, unlike a previous trial in children, but our trial had a pragmatic open design and was not an efficacy study, which is more likely to provide realistic estimates of effectiveness in daily practice. We could not confirm any benefit for temperature control either overall or in subgroups of patients with a higher temperature, unlike a previous efficacy trial in children. This could be because our trial population was much less selected and we used a broader measure (mean temperatures for three days) rather than time to fever resolution.

The main harm with ibuprofen seemed not to be gastrointestinal side effects but an increased likelihood of reconsultation with new or non-resolving symptoms. Most complications were not serious and were mainly self limiting, but there were three more serious complications in the ibuprofen group (pneumonia, meningitis, and quinsy). Although there is concern that interfering with fever can inhibit the immune response, a Cochrane review found insufficient evidence of adverse events to confirm or refute the concern. Previous observational studieshave shown an association between ibuprofen use and the development of necrotising fasciitis in children with chicken pox, which could possibly be mediated by impaired neutrophil function induced by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The ibuprofen use in the latter studies, however, could equally have been a proxy marker for more severe illness. Although the finding of increased reconsultation could have been caused by chance, there was a similar effect of borderline significance in the combined group and adjustment for possible confounders did not modify the effect, so the possibility of modest harm with ibuprofen should probably not be dismissed.

### Ibuprofen for acute treatment of episodic tension-type headache in adults [^1166S13M]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Tension-type headache (TTH) affects about one person in five worldwide. It is divided into infrequent episodic TTH (fewer than one headache per month), frequent episodic TTH (1 to 14 headaches per month), and chronic TTH (15 headaches a month or more). Ibuprofen is one of a number of analgesics suggested for acute treatment of headaches in frequent episodic TTH.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of oral ibuprofen for treatment of acute episodic TTH in adults.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and our own in-house database to January 2015. We sought unpublished studies by asking personal contacts and searching on-line clinical trial registers and manufacturers' websites.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised, placebo-controlled studies (parallel-group or cross-over) using oral ibuprofen for symptomatic relief of an acute episode of TTH. Studies had to be prospective and include at least 10 participants per treatment arm.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, and extracted data. Numbers of participants achieving each outcome were used to calculate risk ratio (RR) and number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNT) or number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNH) of oral ibuprofen compared to placebo for a range of outcomes, predominantly those recommended by the International Headache Society (IHS).

Main Results

We included 12 studies, all of which enrolled adult participants with frequent episodic TTH. Nine used the IHS diagnostic criteria, but two used the older classification of the Ad Hoc Committee, and one did not describe diagnostic criteria but excluded participants with migraines. While 3094 people with TTH participated in these studies, the numbers available for any form of analysis were lower than this; placebo was taken by 733, standard ibuprofen 200 mg by 127, standard ibuprofen 400 mg by 892, and fast-acting ibuprofen 400 mg by 230. Participants had moderate or severe pain at the start of treatment. Other participants were either in studies not reporting outcomes we could analyse, or were given one of several active comparators in single studies. For the IHS-preferred outcome of being pain free at 2 hours the NNT for ibuprofen 400 mg (all formulations) compared with placebo was 14 (95% confidence interval (CI), 8.4 to 47) in four studies, with no significant difference from placebo at 1 hour (moderate quality evidence). The NNT was 5.9 (4.2 to 9.5) for the global evaluation of 'very good' or 'excellent' in three studies (moderate quality evidence). No study reported the number of participants experiencing no worse than mild pain at 1 or 2 hours. The use of rescue medication was lower with ibuprofen 400 mg than with placebo, with the number needed to treat to prevent one event (NNTp) of 8.9 (5.6 to 21) in two studies (low quality evidence). Adverse events were not different between ibuprofen 400 mg and placebo; RR 1.1 (0.64 to 1.7) (high-quality evidence). No serious adverse events were reported.

Authors' Conclusions

Ibuprofen 400 mg provides an important benefit in terms of being pain free at 2 hours for a small number of people with frequent episodic tension-type headache who have an acute headache with moderate or severe initial pain. There is no information about the lesser benefit of no worse than mild pain at 2 hours.
