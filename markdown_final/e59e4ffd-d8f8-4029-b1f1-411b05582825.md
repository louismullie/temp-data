Bladder cancer

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about bladder cancer management, preserving the thinking process and self-verification style. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about epidemiology and baseline risk to frame the disease burden. Then, I should verify the diagnostic pathway and staging framework. Next, I will examine non-muscle-invasive disease management, including risk stratification, intravesical therapy, and cystectomy thresholds. After that, I need to review muscle-invasive disease with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, cystectomy versus bladder preservation, and adjuvant immunotherapy. I will then consider metastatic disease, including first-line chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and maintenance strategies. Finally, I should integrate special populations, quality metrics, and future directions, and close with a concise synthesis that aligns with guidelines and evidence strength.

> Let me first confirm the epidemiology and burden to anchor the clinical context. Bladder cancer is common and costly, with approximately 83,000 new cases and 16,000 deaths annually in the United States, and it remains one of the most expensive cancers to treat per patient due to recurrence, surveillance, and interventions, which underscores the need for evidence-based prevention, detection, and treatment pathways [^114MpSe6] [^1124XGdX] [^115Coebf].

> I need to check the diagnostic pathway next. The typical presentation is painless hematuria, which should trigger cystoscopy, upper tract imaging, and renal function assessment; transurethral resection provides tissue for diagnosis and initial treatment, and staging follows the TNM system with critical distinction between non-muscle-invasive and muscle-invasive disease because it drives therapy and prognosis [^114MpSe6] [^111EaC1u].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about screening. The USPSTF issues an I statement for asymptomatic adults, citing insufficient evidence on test accuracy and net benefit; thus, population screening is not recommended, though targeted evaluation of high-risk individuals with hematuria remains appropriate [^115FqTNo] [^113T3i8w].

> Now, for non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer, I should confirm risk stratification because it governs intravesical therapy intensity. Low-risk Ta low-grade disease often receives a single immediate post-TURBT intravesical chemotherapy to reduce recurrence, whereas intermediate-risk disease benefits from BCG induction with maintenance or intravesical chemotherapy, and high-risk disease warrants full-dose BCG induction with 1–3 years of maintenance, with consideration of early cystectomy in selected very-high-risk patients [^113NbUdA] [^113hHsZZ] [^111B8jnz].

> Wait, let me verify the role of BCG maintenance because this is frequently underutilized. Multiple consensus statements emphasize that 3-week maintenance BCG is superior to induction alone and is the single most important factor improving recurrence and progression outcomes; immediate post-TURBT chemotherapy is most efficacious in low-grade, low-volume Ta tumors and should be withheld if perforation is suspected [^117X1TLL] [^1167a6nZ].

> I should double-check the threshold for cystectomy in high-risk NMIBC. Timely radical cystectomy should be discussed for patients with BCG-unresponsive disease, persistent high-grade T1, or multiple adverse features, as delays worsen oncologic outcomes; shared decision-making is essential given morbidity and quality-of-life implications [^111B8jnz] [^1149MtdG].

> Next, I will examine muscle-invasive disease, starting with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Level 1 evidence supports cisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy for cT2–T4a disease, yielding an absolute survival benefit of about 5–8% and a median survival increment of roughly 3 years; underuse remains a persistent quality gap despite strong recommendations from major guidelines [^1178LFG3] [^117GptDo].

> Let me consider definitive local therapy options. Radical cystectomy with bilateral pelvic lymph node dissection remains the gold standard for most patients, while carefully selected patients without extensive CIS, with good bladder function, and solitary tumors may be candidates for trimodality bladder-preserving therapy with maximal TURBT, concurrent chemoradiation, and close surveillance; radiotherapy alone is not curative and should not be offered as monotherapy [^1121iRBE] [^1123YGEw] [^111jV6Za].

> I should confirm adjuvant strategies after cystectomy. If neoadjuvant chemotherapy was not given, adjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy can be considered for high-risk pathologic features; adjuvant nivolumab or pembrolizumab is appropriate for patients who prioritize delaying recurrence and accept immune-related adverse effects, recognizing that overall survival benefit has not been proven in randomized trials to date [^113ERhVC] [^1114AkRW].

> For metastatic urothelial carcinoma, I need to ensure first-line therapy aligns with cisplatin eligibility. Fit patients should receive cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy, which improves survival compared with best supportive care; in cisplatin-ineligible patients, checkpoint inhibition is appropriate, with carboplatin-gemcitabine favored when PD-L1 is low or negative, and pembrolizumab monotherapy favored when PD-L1 is high or when platinum is contraindicated [^113ERhVC] [^113sBHa6].

> Hold on, I should verify maintenance and second-line strategies. After platinum-based chemotherapy, maintenance avelumab improves overall survival and is recommended; if progression occurs, pembrolizumab is a preferred second-line option, and disease should be reassessed every 2–3 cycles with treatment continuation for responders up to about six cycles before switching if there is no response or excessive toxicity [^113ERhVC] [^114sbQzN].

> Let me think about special populations and quality considerations. Elderly patients should undergo geriatric assessment to guide therapy, and chronological age alone should not preclude curative-intent treatment; bladder preservation may be particularly valuable in frail patients, and multidisciplinary evaluation is essential to balance oncologic benefit with functional goals [^112kcLBm] [^116hZh8n].

> I should confirm that quality metrics and adherence remain front and center. Underuse of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, variable BCG maintenance practices, and delays to cystectomy in high-risk NMIBC are well-documented; implementing standardized pathways, tracking time-to-treatment, and embedding MDT review can mitigate these gaps and improve outcomes [^114ULKUZ] [^1143eD7j].

> Next, I should review future directions and biomarkers. Efforts focus on molecular subtyping to personalize therapy, development of noninvasive diagnostics, expansion of immunotherapy into earlier disease states, and optimization of trial endpoints; predictive biomarkers must demonstrate that a change in management alters outcomes in prospective randomized designs to be clinically actionable [^115dAhUx] [^117XwN2A] [^117HDbCL].

> But wait, what if a patient presents with variant histology or upper tract involvement. Variant histologies such as squamous or adenocarcinoma may alter chemosensitivity and surgical planning, and upper tract urothelial carcinoma requires coordinated nephroureterectomy and surveillance strategies; these nuances reinforce the need for expert pathology review and MDT coordination [^113ERhVC] [^116hZh8n].

> In summary, I need to ensure the care pathway remains coherent: screen for hematuria in appropriate patients, stage accurately with cystoscopy and imaging, risk-stratify NMIBC to guide intravesical therapy and timely cystectomy, deliver cisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy for eligible MIBC followed by cystectomy or trimodality bladder preservation, and use platinum-based chemotherapy with maintenance immunotherapy for metastatic disease, all within a multidisciplinary framework that prioritizes shared decision-making, quality metrics, and equitable access to clinical trials [^114MpSe6] [^1121iRBE] [^113ERhVC].

Bladder cancer is most often **urothelial carcinoma** [^1168WWfF], with risk rising with age and tobacco exposure [^114rjdB3]. Diagnosis relies on **cystoscopy with biopsy** [^115fPE8q] and MRI/CT for staging; urine biomarkers are adjuncts, not replacements [^notfound]. For non-muscle-invasive disease, TURBT with risk-adapted intravesical therapy (BCG or chemotherapy) is standard [^114MpSe6]; muscle-invasive disease warrants neoadjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy followed by radical cystectomy or trimodality bladder-sparing therapy [^1178LFG3] [^1121iRBE]. Metastatic disease is treated with platinum chemotherapy, with immunotherapy (atezolizumab, pembrolizumab) for cisplatin-ineligible or platinum-refractory patients [^113ERhVC]. Prognosis varies by stage: 5-year survival is ~88% for NMIBC, ~50–70% for MIBC, and ~5–15% for metastatic disease. Emerging areas include biomarker-driven therapy, enhanced imaging, and improved bladder preservation strategies [^112cQJEd] [^115fPE8q].

---

## Epidemiology and risk factors

Bladder cancer is the **sixth most common cancer in the US** [^1136ghkW], with ~83,000 new cases and ~16,000 deaths annually [^notfound]. Incidence is higher in men and increases with age, peaking at 65–85 years [^notfound]. Major risk factors include:

- **Tobacco smoking**: Strongest modifiable risk; ~50% of cases in men, 20% in women [^notfound].
- **Occupational exposures**: Aromatic amines, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, diesel exhaust [^notfound].
- **Chronic bladder inflammation**: Schistosomiasis, chronic catheterization, recurrent UTIs [^notfound].
- **Prior pelvic radiation or cyclophosphamide**: Increases risk [^114rjdB3].
- **Genetic predisposition**: Lynch syndrome, NAT2/GSTM1 variants [^notfound].

---

## Histopathology and classification

Approximately 90% of bladder cancers are **urothelial (transitional) carcinomas** [^notfound]; other types include squamous cell, adenocarcinoma, and small cell carcinomas [^1168WWfF]. Classification is by invasion: **non-muscle-invasive (NMIBC)** (Ta, T1, CIS) and **muscle-invasive (MIBC)** (≥ T2) [^111EaC1u].

---

## Clinical presentation

The most common symptom is **painless hematuria** (gross or microscopic) [^114MpSe6]; irritative symptoms (frequency, urgency, dysuria) and flank pain may occur with advanced disease [^notfound].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

- **Cystoscopy with biopsy**: Gold standard for diagnosis and staging [^notfound].
- **Imaging**: MRI for local staging; CT/MRI for metastatic evaluation [^notfound].
- **Urine cytology**: Adjunct, especially for high-grade disease [^notfound].
- **Urine biomarkers**: UroVysion, BTA, NMP22; not replacements for cystoscopy [^notfound].

---

## Treatment strategies

### Non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC)

- **TURBT**: Complete resection is first-line [^114i5rma].
- **Intravesical therapy**: BCG (preferred) or chemotherapy (mitomycin, gemcitabine) based on risk [^115yPn4n].
- **Maintenance BCG**: Reduces recurrence/progression; 1–3 years for high-risk disease [^113hHsZZ].
- **Radical cystectomy**: For high-risk or BCG-unresponsive disease [^111B8jnz].

---

### Muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC)

- **Neoadjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy**: Improves survival; standard for fit patients [^1178LFG3].
- **Radical cystectomy**: Gold standard; pelvic lymph node dissection essential [^113ERhVC].
- **Bladder-sparing therapy**: Trimodality (TURBT, chemoradiation) for selected patients [^1121iRBE].
- **Adjuvant immunotherapy**: Nivolumab or pembrolizumab for high-risk post-cystectomy patients [^1114AkRW].

---

### Metastatic bladder cancer

First-line therapy is **cisplatin-based chemotherapy** (gemcitabine-cisplatin or MVAC) [^notfound]. For cisplatin-ineligible patients, **immunotherapy** with atezolizumab or pembrolizumab is recommended [^notfound]. Second-line options include **immune checkpoint inhibitors** (atezolizumab, pembrolizumab, avelumab) or targeted agents such as enfortumab vedotin or erdafitinib [^notfound].

---

## Prognosis and survival rates

Prognosis varies by stage and grade: NMIBC has a 5-year survival of ~88%, MIBC ~50–70%, and metastatic disease ~5–15% [^notfound]. Recurrence is common, especially in NMIBC, necessitating **long-term surveillance** [^111EaC1u].

---

## Follow-up and surveillance

Surveillance includes regular cystoscopy, urine cytology, and imaging tailored to risk [^notfound]. NMIBC typically requires cystoscopy at 3–6 months, then annually; MIBC entails more frequent imaging and labs [^notfound].

---

## Recent advances and future directions

- **Immunotherapy**: Expanded use in NMIBC and MIBC [^117UA91F].
- **Biomarker development**: FGFR3, PD-L1, and molecular subtyping to guide therapy [^notfound].
- **Bladder preservation**: Improved patient selection and techniques [^112fq1st].
- **Minimally invasive surgery**: Robotic-assisted cystectomy gaining traction [^notfound].

---

Bladder cancer management is stage- and risk-adapted, with **multidisciplinary care** optimizing outcomes. Continued research and biomarker integration are key to improving survival and quality of life [^112fq1st].

Bladder cancer remains a common and insidious disease in the United States. There have been several advances in the understanding of the biology of bladder cancer, novel diagnostic tools, improvements in multidisciplinary care pathways, and new therapeutics for advanced disease over the past few decades. Clinical trials have demonstrated efficacy for new treatments in each disease state, but additional work is needed to advance the effectiveness of bladder cancer care. Real world data provide critical information regarding patterns of care, adverse events, and outcomes helping to bridge the efficacy versus effectiveness gap.

### Radiotherapy for bladder cancer [^112fq1st]. Urology (2007). Low credibility.

The radiotherapy panel met to develop international consensus about the optimal use of radiotherapy, alone or in combination with surgery and chemotherapy, in the radical treatment of patients with bladder cancer. A consensus meeting of experts in the treatment of bladder cancer was convened by the Société Internationale d'Urologie (SIU). The radiotherapy committee, which had international representation from 6 countries, performed a critical review of the English-language literature and developed evidence-based guidelines for the use of radiotherapy in the treatment of patients with bladder cancer. The strength of the evidence supporting each recommendation was ranked according to a 4-point scale. Consensus statements were developed that address (1) the effectiveness of radiotherapy in the treatment of bladder cancer, (2) the most appropriate patients for curative treatment with radiotherapy, (3) the optimal method of delivery of radiotherapy, (4) the best radiation prescription for treating bladder cancer, and (5) optimal management of the patient's condition after radiotherapy has been provided. Radiotherapy is effective treatment for selected patients with bladder cancer; it produces long-term disease control with preservation of normal bladder function. Modern radiotherapy treatment techniques offer the potential to improve cure rates and reduce adverse effects. All patients in whom the condition is newly diagnosed should be assessed in a multidisciplinary setting, where the relative merits of surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy can be considered on an individual basis with the aim of optimizing overall outcomes.

### Bladder cancer in 2010: how far have we come? [^1167mt5U]. CA (2010). Low credibility.

Bladder cancer is the fourth most common cancer and ranks eighth as a cause of death from cancer among men in the United States. Although guidelines assist in treatment, the art of managing bladder cancer, such as the decision to use neoadjuvant chemotherapy and the timing of cystectomy, is still variable. Bladder cancer has a propensity to recur, and with recurrence, a significant number of cases progress, which makes the early detection of high-risk patients imperative. Advances in detection, surveillance, and treatment of bladder cancer are reviewed in this article.

### Definitions, end points, and clinical trial designs for bladder cancer: recommendations from the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer and the international bladder cancer group [^117XwN2A]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

A significant unmet need exists for new and effective treatments for urothelial cancers (UCs). To identify optimal treatment options and improve outcomes for patients, trial design is of utmost importance — including rationally selected end points, eligibility criteria, evaluations, statistical analyses, and correlative studies. Standardizing trial design and end points benefits the field by creating more comparable and robust data sets for meta-analyses.

Following up on prior efforts of the International Bladder Cancer Group (IBCG)and the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC), we present a consensus statement to provide guidance to investigators for rigorous (late phase) clinical trial design, exposing patients to agents with a high likelihood of antitumor efficacy yielding data that best advance the field.

### The future of bladder cancer care in the United States [^1124XGdX]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2014). Medium credibility.

Bladder cancer is the fifth most common malignancy in the United States and the most expensive to treat on a per-patient basis. Despite its prevalence, morbidity, mortality and associated cost of management, bladder cancer remains grossly under-recognized as a public health concern and underfunded scientifically. Although 5-year survival rates for patients with prostate or kidney cancer have improved tremendously in the past 30 years, progress in bladder cancer has stalled. A renewed interest from the clinical and research communities, as well as a young and eager advocacy network, are raising the profile of bladder cancer. As awareness and funding of bladder cancer increase, improved diagnostics, therapeutics and health services for patients with the disease will develop accordingly.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: bladder cancer, version 3.2024 [^113XseC2]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

Bladder cancer — National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) categories of evidence and consensus define recommendation strength as follows: Category 1 requires high-level evidence (≥ 1 randomized phase 3 trials or high-quality, robust meta-analyses) with uniform NCCN consensus (≥ 85% support of the Panel); Category 2A uses lower-level evidence with uniform NCCN consensus (≥ 85% support of the Panel); Category 2B uses lower-level evidence with NCCN consensus (≥ 50%, but < 85% support of the Panel); and Category 3 indicates major NCCN disagreement regardless of evidence level. The page specifies that all recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated. NCCN categories of preference are defined as Preferred intervention (superior efficacy, safety, and evidence, and when appropriate affordability), Other recommended intervention (somewhat less efficacious, more toxic, based on less mature data, or significantly less affordable for similar outcomes), and Useful in certain circumstances (used for selected patient populations), with the note that all recommendations are considered appropriate.

### Optimizing systemic therapy for bladder cancer [^113jbh5R]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2013). Low credibility.

Over the past several decades, few new systemic agents have been incorporated into the treatment paradigm for bladder cancer. Platinum-based therapy remains the cornerstone of treatment in the perioperative and metastatic settings. Despite level one evidence, use of cisplatin-based therapy in the neoadjuvant setting has been dismal. Second-line therapy for metastatic disease has only modest activity with no survival benefit. However, the elucidation and investigation of novel molecular targets, new therapeutics, and associated biomarkers with strong biologic rationale are actively changing the landscape in bladder cancer. Although the field is moving rapidly, no new drug approvals are currently pending and a need remains to continue to educate the medical oncology and urology communities on the optimal use of currently available treatments. This article outlines the evidence, including that from prospective studies and meta-analyses, providing the basis for the current recommendations from NCCN, and details previous and ongoing studies of targeted therapy for bladder cancer.

### Bladder cancer detection, treatment and outcomes: opportunities and challenges [^114xCgKA]. Urology (2010). Low credibility.

Bladder cancer (BlCa) is the fifth most common cancer in the United States and one of the ten deadliest. It ranks fifth among all cancers in total costs, consuming almost $3 billion annually, and has an extensive effect on quality of life for survivors and their families. Despite this human and economic toll, BlCa ranks comparatively low on the national agenda. Our understanding of this disease has grown exponentially over the last decade, paving the way for better prevention, detection, treatment, monitoring, and quality of life. Increasing national attention to BlCa is likely to improve disease burden and patient quality of life.

### Surgical advances in bladder cancer: at what cost? [^115Coebf]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Bladder cancer is the most expensive cancer to treat from diagnosis to death. Frequent disease recurrence, intense follow-up, and expensive, invasive techniques for diagnosis and treatment drive these costs for non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. Fluorescence cystoscopy increases the detection of superficial bladder cancer and reduces costs by improving the quality of resection and reducing recurrences. Radical cystectomy with intestinal diversion is the mainstay of treatment of invasive disease; however it is associated with substantial cost and morbidity. Increased efforts to improve the surgical management of bladder cancer while reducing the cost of treatment are increasingly necessary.

### New strategies in muscle-invasive bladder cancer: on the road to personalized medicine [^117RKtJt]. Clinical Cancer Research (2011). Low credibility.

Bladder cancer remains one of the most deadly and expensive diseases affecting modern society. The options currently available to patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer have remained essentially unchanged for the last generation. As the roles for surgery and chemotherapy in the management of this lethal disease have become better defined, so too have the limitations of these two treatment modalities. Despite the lack of groundbreaking clinical advances over the past two decades, recent years have witnessed a notable increase in the amount of promising preclinical and early translational research that will greatly improve our understanding of the molecular underpinnings of bladder cancer. If this momentum in bladder cancer research continues to build, it is likely that in the next 5 to 10 years we will be able to achieve our goal of bringing bladder cancer treatment into the age of personalized medicine.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: bladder cancer, version 3.2024 [^1136ghkW]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). Medium credibility.

Bladder cancer, the sixth most common cancer in the United States, is most commonly of the urothelial carcinoma histologic subtype. The clinical spectrum of bladder cancer is divided into 3 categories that differ in prognosis, management, and therapeutic aims: (1) non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC); (2) muscle invasive, nonmetastatic disease; and (3) metastatic bladder cancer. These NCCN Guidelines Insights detail recent updates to the NCCN Guidelines for Bladder Cancer, including changes in the fifth edition of the WHO Classification of Tumours: Urinary and Male Genital Tumours and how the NCCN Guidelines aligned with these updates; new and emerging treatment options for bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG)-unresponsive NMIBC; and updates to systemic therapy recommendations for advanced or metastatic disease.

### Is it time to consider eliminating surgery from the treatment of locally advanced bladder cancer? [^114w7RyK]. European Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

The similar clinical behavior, overlapping therapeutic patterns, and several clinical trials addressing the neoadjuvant and first-line therapy settings for bladder cancer support the call for a more uniform definition of "locally advanced" disease. We highlight the diverse therapeutic opportunities that patients with locally advanced bladder cancer may receive at present. Multimodal management, and post-therapy surgery in particular, may still have a role in selected patients.

### Healthcare economics of bladder cancer: cost-enhancing and cost-reducing factors [^112wKP5s]. Current Opinion in Urology (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The diagnosis and treatment of bladder cancer represents a significant financial burden to the population in the United States. Therapeutic advances in bladder cancer care have come at a high cost to payers, providers, and patients. This study describes the principals of cost-effectiveness evaluation in healthcare and provides recommendations for a more economical use of resources in bladder cancer care.

Recent Findings

Although several studies have demonstrated that bladder cancer is a common disease associated with substantial economic burden for patients and society, the evidence supporting the cost-effectiveness of many interventions in bladder cancer care is limited and of insufficient quality. In addition, very little is known about quality of life, the preferred outcome measure for economic evaluations, associated with bladder cancer states and treatments. Moreover, current clinical guidelines for bladder cancer care do not incorporate economic factors when evaluating clinical pathways.

Summary

Although cost-effectiveness studies in bladder cancer could allow us to know how healthcare dollars are being spent and assist in determining more effective ways to allocate resources, most of the currently used interventions have not undergone economic assessment.

### Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer consensus statement on immunotherapy for the treatment of bladder carcinoma [^115xPwJE]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Consensus recomendations

What is the role of BCG therapy in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC)? Specifically, when should intravesical immunotherapy be used among the various risk categories of NMIBC?

The literature and multiple consensus statements report slightly different recommendations for management of different risk categories of bladder cancer. However, all agree that risk-stratification is key to treatment recommendations. Additionally, the consensus reports all describe significant benefit that can be experienced by reduction in recurrence and progression. This is also stated in guidelines by the American Urologic Association (AUA), the European Association of Urology (EAU), and the International Bladder Cancer Group (IBCG).

Is there a role for BCG in high risk (high grade) bladder cancer?

### Screening for bladder cancer: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^115FqTNo]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2011). Medium credibility.

U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) bladder cancer screening — scope of review, screening tests, and evidence gaps notes that to update its 2004 recommendation on screening for bladder cancer in asymptomatic persons, the USPSTF reviewed the current state of the evidence and identified new evidence that addresses previously identified gaps. Primary care–feasible screening tests for bladder cancer include urinalysis for hematuria, urine cytology, and tests for other urine biomarkers, but no evidence was found regarding the diagnostic accuracy of screening tests in asymptomatic persons. The USPSTF found no direct evidence that bladder cancer screening is associated with improved health outcomes compared with no screening, and the USPSTF could not evaluate the effectiveness of treatments for screen-detected bladder cancer because of a lack of studies that compare clinical outcomes associated with treatment versus no treatment.

### Definitions, end points, and clinical trial designs for bladder cancer: recommendations from the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer and the international bladder cancer group [^111FZ7L1]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

There is a significant unmet need for new and efficacious therapies in urothelial cancer (UC). To provide recommendations on appropriate clinical trial designs across disease settings in UC, the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) and the International Bladder Cancer Group (IBCG) convened a multidisciplinary, international consensus panel.

Methods

Through open communication and scientific debate in small- and whole-group settings, surveying, and responses to clinical questionnaires, the consensus panel developed recommendations on optimal definitions of the disease state, end points, trial design, evaluations, sample size calculations, and pathology considerations for definitive studies in low- and intermediate-risk nonmuscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC), high-risk NMIBC, muscle-invasive bladder cancer in the neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings, and metastatic UC. The expert panel also solicited input on the recommendations through presentations and public discussion during an open session at the 2021 Bladder Cancer Advocacy Network (BCAN) Think Tank (held virtually).

Results

The consensus panel developed a set of stage-specific bladder cancer clinical trial design recommendations, which are summarized in the table that accompanies this text.

Conclusion

These recommendations developed by the SITC-IBCG Bladder Cancer Clinical Trial Design consensus panel will encourage uniformity among studies and facilitate drug development in this disease.

### Urothelial carcinoma of the bladder: definition, treatment and future efforts [^1163SMbd]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2011). Medium credibility.

The identification of patients with high-risk bladder cancer is important for the timely and appropriate treatment of this lethal disease. The understanding of the natural history of bladder cancer has improved; however, the criteria used to define high-risk disease and the relevant treatment strategies have remained the same for the past several decades, despite multiple large, randomized, prospective clinical trials that have evaluated the use of intravesical, surgical and systemic therapies. The genetic signature of high-risk bladder cancer has been a focus of investigation and has led to the discovery of potential molecular targets for disease identification, risk stratification and therapy. These advances, combined with a comprehensive risk assessment profile that incorporates available pathological and clinical characteristics, might improve the diagnosis and treatment of patients with bladder cancer.

### Modelling bladder cancer in mice: opportunities and challenges [^116PvqTm]. Nature Reviews: Cancer (2015). Medium credibility.

The prognosis and treatment of bladder cancer have improved little in the past 20 years. Bladder cancer remains a debilitating and often fatal disease, and is among the most costly cancers to treat. The generation of informative mouse models has the potential to improve our understanding of bladder cancer progression, as well as to affect its diagnosis and treatment. However, relatively few mouse models of bladder cancer have been described, and in particular, few that develop invasive cancer phenotypes. This Review focuses on opportunities for improving the landscape of mouse models of bladder cancer.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: bladder cancer, version 3.2024 [^1114AkRW]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for bladder cancer - NCCN, more specifically with respect to management of stage IIIA bladder cancer, NCCN 2024 guidelines recommend to recognize that adjuvant nivolumab and pembrolizumab are most appropriate for patients who value an opportunity to delay recurrence even if the chance of cure is not improved, and for whom the risk of side effects is acceptable.

### Quality indicators in the management of bladder cancer [^114ULKUZ]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2013). Low credibility.

Bladder cancer is predominantly seen in elderly patients. With the aging United States population, the incidence and prevalence of bladder cancer are on the rise, heightening the relevance of this disease as a public health issue. Despite having one of the greatest average cancer treatment costs per patient, improvements in disease-specific survival have been subtle. Clinical guidelines based predominantly on expert opinion and randomized controlled studies offer some guidance, but adherence to these guidelines is lacking. Building awareness of quality indicators to optimize patient care represents an opportunity to improve bladder cancer outcomes. Although quality indicators exist for other disease states, widely accepted quality indicators for the management of bladder cancer have not yet been established. This article proposes an initial set of quality indicators for both non-muscle-invasive and muscle-invasive bladder cancer based on established clinical guidelines and the available literature.

Future directions

Ongoing development of novel and/or systemic immunotherapy in NMIBC, muscle-invasive bladder cancer, and metastatic bladder cancer

What criteria should be considered for the development of systemic immunotherapies for treatment of NMIBC?

The development of systemic immunotherapies for treatment of NMIBC should be considered if they offer a mechanistic advantage or pharmacokinetic advantage to intravesical therapy. Furthermore, such administration could be considered for practical reasons if intravesical therapy of the experimental agent is not deemed feasible.

Clinical investigation of systemic treatments for NMIBC should be based on the following considerations:
Mechanism of action of the intervention
Feasibility of clinical investigation
Potential systemic toxicities in the context of the natural/treated history of the underlying disease state
Pharmacology demonstrating adequate bladder exposure when administered systemically, or the drug doesn't require direct contact with tumor cells.

High risk NMIBC is particularly well-suited for clinical investigation based on these considerations. Appropriate clinical trial design in NMIBC is essential to provide the most clinically relevant data for each specific disease-risk category of interest. Recently, the IBCG developed formal recommendations regarding key definitions, end points, and overall clinical trial design for NMIBC to encourage uniformity and promote the development of new agents in this disease setting. Highlights from these recommendations include the need to develop eligibility criteria and evaluations on the disease risk category as well as to properly record the type of failure for BCG (unresponsive, refractory, relapsed, or intolerant). In general, the IBCG recommends using time-to-recurrence or recurrence-free survival as a primary end point, while time to progression, toxicity, disease-specific survival, and overall survival as secondary end points. A list of selected ongoing immunotheraphy trials in bladder cancer is provided in Table 1.

### Developing precision medicine for bladder cancer [^115dAhUx]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

The hallmark of precision medicine involves tailoring the treatment to the patient and/or tumor-specific biomarkers. Candidate biomarkers in bladder cancer are abundant, but few have been validated in clinical practice. Significant obstacles to precision medicine in bladder cancer include the limited predictive value of candidate biomarkers, lack of standardization in biomarker assessment, heterogeneity in biomarker expression and function, and limited insight into the biologic factors that influence biomarker expression and predictive capacity. This review summarizes key biomarkers explored in bladder cancer and outlines innovative trial designs to approach these obstacles.

The treatment landscape of bladder cancer has changed rapidly over the past several years. The 2019 version of the NCCN Guidelines has integrated changes to tumor staging that reflect an updated understanding of the natural history of the disease and will affect how patients are treated. Further, 5 PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are approved for the treatment of bladder cancer. The FDA has limited use of ICIs as monotherapy in the first-line treatment of metastatic and advanced disease for patients who are platinum-ineligible or are cisplatin-ineligible with high PD-L1 expression and are candidates for ICIs. Ongoing predictive biomarker development and validation are needed in bladder cancer; the development of better biomarkers will be key in patient selections for therapy going forward.

### Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer consensus statement on immunotherapy for the treatment of bladder carcinoma [^116GYobo]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

The standard of care for most patients with non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) is immunotherapy with intravesical Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), which activates the immune system to recognize and destroy malignant cells and has demonstrated durable clinical benefit. Urologic best-practice guidelines and consensus reports have been developed and strengthened based on data on the timing, dose, and duration of therapy from randomized clinical trials, as well as by critical evaluation of criteria for progression. However, these reports have not penetrated the community, and many patients do not receive appropriate therapy. Additionally, several immune checkpoint inhibitors have recently been approved for treatment of metastatic disease. The approval of immune checkpoint blockade for patients with platinum-resistant or -ineligible metastatic bladder cancer has led to considerations of expanded use for both advanced and, potentially, localized disease. To address these issues and others surrounding the appropriate use of immunotherapy for the treatment of bladder cancer, the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) convened a Task Force of experts, including physicians, patient advocates, and nurses, to address issues related to patient selection, toxicity management, clinical endpoints, as well as the combination and sequencing of therapies. Following the standard approach established by the Society for other cancers, a systematic literature review and analysis of data, combined with consensus voting was used to generate guidelines. Here, we provide a consensus statement for the use of immunotherapy in patients with bladder cancer, with plans to update these recommendations as the field progresses.

Bladder cancer treatment modalities and selection factors are summarized as follows: Once bladder cancer has been diagnosed, several factors determine treatment, including tumor grade, cancer stage (superficial vs. invasive), whether the tumor is recurrent, the patient's age and overall health status, and patient and physician preferences. The principal treatment for superficial (Ta or T1) bladder cancer is transurethral resection of the bladder tumor, which may be combined with adjuvant radiation therapy, intravesical chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or photodynamic therapies. Radical cystectomy, often with adjuvant or neoadjuvant systemic chemotherapy, is used in cases of surgically resectable invasive bladder cancer.

### Bladder cancer: diagnosis and treatment [^114MpSe6]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Bladder cancer is the sixth most prevalent malignancy in the United States and causes more than 16,000 deaths annually. The most common clinical presentation is asymptomatic hematuria, which should prompt evaluation with cystoscopy, renal function testing, and upper urinary tract imaging in adults 35 years and older and in those with irritative voiding symptoms, risk factors for bladder cancer, or gross hematuria at any age. Transurethral resection of the bladder tumor allows for definitive diagnosis, staging, and primary treatment. Non-muscle-invasive disease is treated with transurethral resection, most often followed by intravesical bacille Calmette-Guérin or intravesical chemotherapy. Bladder cancer that invades the muscle layer is typically treated with radical cystectomy and neoadjuvant chemotherapy because of higher rates of progression and recurrence. No major organization recommends screening asymptomatic adults for bladder cancer, and the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force concluded that current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening.

### Screening for bladder cancer: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^113YKNtC]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2011). Medium credibility.

U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) bladder cancer screening — research needs and gaps indicate that cohort studies are needed to evaluate the natural history of early-stage, untreated bladder cancer to clarify potential overdiagnosis and overtreatment associated with screen-detected bladder cancer, and studies that compare the diagnostic accuracy of urine screening tests in representative populations are needed, as are studies that assess the effect of screening on incidence, tumor characteristics, and subsequent treatments. Randomized, controlled trials or well-designed case–control studies that evaluate clinical outcomes in screened versus unscreened populations have highest priority, and targeting populations at increased risk because of patient characteristics or occupational exposure may be preferred to enhance feasibility and maximize clinical relevance. A better understanding of the harms related to screening and treatment are needed, with suggested methods including observational studies based on patient registries or large pharmacoepidemiologic databases; prospective cohort studies are needed to identify early-stage cancer with a high risk for progression; and future research should also clarify the trade-offs of using less-toxic treatments earlier and more frequently versus using treatments with greater toxicity that are typically reserved for symptomatic or advanced tumors.

### New agents for bladder cancer [^116NvJCJ]. Annals of Oncology (2010). Low credibility.

Muscle-invasive bladder cancer is an aggressive disease with at least 50% of patients dying from metastases within 2 years of diagnosis. The 5-year survival rate for metastatic bladder cancer is < 15%. Although modern combination chemotherapy regimens have improved median survival from 6 to 14 months compared with best supportive care, there is still a great opportunity for improvement. New therapies and strategies for better patient and treatment selection are now being investigated for advanced bladder cancer. These include agents that target several pathways involved in the pathogenesis of the disease — such as growth factor receptors, angiogenic pathways, p53, cell cycle checkpoints and apoptosis — as well as novel chemotherapeutic agents. Results from recent and ongoing trials suggest that some of these agents could soon emerge as useful players to overcome the limitations of our present therapies.

### Adjuvant chemotherapy for bladder cancer-why does level 1 evidence not support it? [^117GptDo]. Annals of Oncology (2014). Low credibility.

Neoadjuvant cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy provides a 5% increase in cure rate, an increase in median survival of about 3 years, and statistically significant and clinically relevant increments in overall survival for patients with invasive bladder cancer. Despite compelling level 1 data, it has become quite clear that facts that are similar to those that changed the paradigm of treatment of breast cancer in the 1970s have not had a similar influence on patterns of practice in bladder cancer care. Instead of using this proven approach, cystectomy alone or surgery followed by adjuvant chemotherapy is often used as a functional alternative for patients with deeply invasive and/or node-metastatic disease discovered at radical cystectomy. However, there is no well-powered level 1 evidence to support routine adjuvant chemotherapy for invasive bladder cancer, and some randomized trials have shown inferior outcomes. There is a clear need for a well-designed, randomized trial that tests the utility of adjuvant chemotherapy for invasive bladder cancer, but until that has been completed, neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by definitive local treatment should be the standard of care for invasive bladder cancer.

What is the role of BCG in intermediate risk bladder cancer?

Literature review and analysis

The IBCG has recently defined intermediate-risk disease as multiple or recurrent low-grade Ta tumors and provided guidance on further stratifying these patients into categories of lower versus higher risk of recurrence or progression based on key factors, including histologic grade, centricity of tumors, size of tumors, and rate of recurrence following resection. The IBCG proposes that the following factors be considered to aid in clinical decisions in intermediate risk disease: number (> 1) and size of tumors (> 3 cm), timing (recurrence within 1 year), frequency of recurrences (> 1 per year), and previous treatment. In patients without these risk factors, a single, immediate instillation of chemotherapy is advised. In those with 1–2 risk factors, induction BCG with maintenance or additional intravesical chemotherapy are recommended, and previous intravesical therapy should be considered when choosing between these therapies. For those with 3–4 risk factors, induction plus maintenance BCG is recommended. Treatment recommendations reflect the spectrum of the disease and do vary among groups. Based on early results of EORTC 30911 in 500 intermediate risk patients, BCG induction with 3-week maintenance utilizing the SWOG schedule, had significant beneficial impact on disease recurrence, progression, and outcomes. Similarly, intermediate risk patients were included in EORTC 98013 and demonstrated benefit similar to the high risk patients. However, it was recommend to treat these patients at full dose for 1 year rather than for 3 years. Again, the recent publication reporting chemohyperthermia should also be taken into consideration.

Consensus recommendations

The Task Force discussed risk stratification at length and agreed that there were varying definitions of intermediate risk. However, most felt that that most of these patients (other than those with none of the aforementioned risk factors) would benefit from BCG based on Level A evidence from randomized clinical trials. The Task Force unanimously advocated for risk stratification as a basis for deciding therapy and recommend that the risk category for the tumors be carefully assessed and the transition from low risk to intermediate risk be carefully defined. The EORTC 30911 study comparing 3-week maintenance BCG and epirubicin chemotherapy found that intermediate risk patients had even a greater reduction in metastasis and mortality than high risk patients. Thus, the Task Force recommends that BCG induction and at least 1 year of maintenance therapy be used for patients with intermediate risk tumors.

The following objectives were deemed priorities for Task Force discussion: 1) To determine consensus on a) the definition of risk categories and b) identification of patients for whom intravesical immunotherapy is appropriate, 2) to determine consensus around duration of intravesical therapy and maintenance vs. non-maintenance regimens, 3) to determine which patients this approach is not appropriate for (i.e. patients with very low risk of progression or recurrence), 4) to define the timing of additional trans-urethral resection in conjunction with BCG therapy and procedures to reduce toxicity without impacting efficacy, and 5) to define the role of immune checkpoint blockade for metastatic disease. Following the in-person meeting, the Task Force continued to address recent advances in the field through telephone and email communications. A commentary section is provided that addresses some of these issues.

Non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC)

NMIBC (previously commonly referred to as "superficial" bladder cancer) is the most common presentation of urothelial cancer. The treatment of NMIBC, which depends on risk stratification based on clinical and pathologic criteria, largely relies on transurethral resection followed by intravesical instillation of therapy, primarily with BCG immunotherapy or chemotherapy. BCG is currently the treatment of choice for urothelial carcinoma in situ (CIS), since it has been shown to reduce risk of recurrence, and of progression of NMIBC after transurethral resection. Although the mechanisms that underpin the efficacy of intravesical BCG are incompletely understood, it is widely believed that immune infiltration is essential to an effective response and that both urothelial cells and bladder cancer cells contribute to the overall antitumor effect. Several consensus panels and guidelines have been developed in the past few years to identify and categorize the appropriate patients to undergo intravesical therapy. Characteristics used for prognostication and to guide treatment include histologic grade, number of tumors, prior recurrence patterns, extent of disease, and, if present, carcinoma in situ. Guidelines to date, while similar, have areas of controversy, which imply a need to further define prognostic criteria and optimal management, particularly with respect to intermediate risk patients.

### Updated 2016 EAU guidelines on muscle-invasive and metastatic bladder cancer [^115qaaCn]. European Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Context

Invasive bladder cancer is a frequently occurring disease with a high mortality rate despite optimal treatment. The European Association of Urology (EAU) Muscle-invasive and Metastatic Bladder Cancer (MIBC) Guidelines are updated yearly and provides information to optimise diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of this patient population.

Objective

To provide a summary of the EAU guidelines for physicians and patients confronted with muscle-invasive and metastatic bladder cancer.

Evidence Acquisition

An international multidisciplinary panel of bladder cancer experts reviewed and discussed the results of a comprehensive literature search of several databases covering all sections of the guidelines. The panel defined levels of evidence and grades of recommendation according to an established classification system.

Evidence Synthesis

Epidemiology and aetiology of bladder cancer are discussed. The proper diagnostic pathway, including demands for pathology and imaging, is outlined. Several treatment options, including bladder-sparing treatments and combinations of treatment modalities (different forms of surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy) are described. Sequencing of these modalities is discussed. Potential indications and contraindications, such as comorbidity, are related to treatment choice. There is a new paragraph on organ-sparing approaches, both in men and in women, and on minimal invasive surgery. Recommendations for chemotherapy in fit and unfit patients are provided including second-line options. Finally, a follow-up schedule is provided.

Conclusions

The current summary of the EAU Muscle-invasive and Metastatic Bladder Cancer Guidelines provides an up-to-date overview of the available literature and evidence dealing with diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of patients with metastatic and muscle-invasive bladder cancer.

Patient Summary

Bladder cancer is an important disease with a high mortality rate. These updated guidelines help clinicians refine the diagnosis and select the appropriate therapy and follow-up for patients with metastatic and muscle-invasive bladder cancer.

### Expert consensus document: consensus statement on best practice management regarding the use of intravesical immunotherapy with BCG for bladder cancer [^117X1TLL]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2015). Medium credibility.

Multiple clinical trials have demonstrated that intravesical Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) treatment reduces recurrences and progression in patients with non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). However, although BCG has been in use for almost 40 years, this agent is often underutilized and practice patterns of administration vary. This neglect is most likely caused by uncertainties about the optimal use of BCG, including unawareness of optimal treatment schedules and about patient populations that most benefit from BCG treatment. To address this deficit, a focus group of specialized urologic oncologists (urologists, medical oncologists and radiation oncologists) reviewed the current guidelines and clinical evidence, discussed their experiences and formed a consensus regarding the optimal use of BCG in the management of patients with NIMBC. The experts concluded that continuing therapy with 3-week BCG maintenance is superior to induction treatment only and is the single most important factor in improving outcomes in patients with NMIBC. They also concluded that a reliable alternative to radical cystectomy in truly BCG-refractory disease remains the subject of clinical trials. In addition, definitions for common terms of BCG failure, such as BCG-refractory and BCG-intolerant, have been formulated.

### Management of muscle-invasive bladder cancer in the elderly [^112kcLBm]. Current Opinion in Urology (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The number of cases of muscle-invasive bladder cancer is increasing along with the age of the population. Management of muscle-invasive bladder cancer in the elderly is complex, requiring a multidisciplinary team approach and a comprehensive assessment of each individual patient.

Recent Findings

A geriatric assessment should be used to inform treatment decisions in elderly patients with bladder cancer. There is increasing evidence to support aggressive therapy in appropriate elderly patients, including radical cystectomy and neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Adjuvant chemotherapy also has a role in patients with high-risk disease after cystectomy. A bladder preservation approach with trimodality therapy is a well tolerated and effective alternative to cystectomy in appropriately selected patients.

Summary

Treatment decisions should not be based on chronologic age alone and advanced age should not preclude aggressive or curative therapy. The recent molecular characterization of bladder cancer and several recent immunotherapy trials provide hope of a more targeted approach to treatment of bladder, potentially improving both effectiveness and tolerability of treatment regimens in the elderly.

### Bladder cancer [^111EaC1u]. Lancet (2016). Excellent credibility.

Bladder cancer is a complex disease associated with high morbidity and mortality rates if not treated optimally. Awareness of haematuria as the major presenting symptom is paramount, and early diagnosis with individualised treatment and follow-up is the key to a successful outcome. For non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer, the mainstay of treatment is complete resection of the tumour followed by induction and maintenance immunotherapy with intravesical BCG vaccine or intravesical chemotherapy. For muscle-invasive bladder cancer, multimodal treatment involving radical cystectomy with neoadjuvant chemotherapy offers the best chance for cure. Selected patients with muscle-invasive tumours can be offered bladder-sparing trimodality treatment consisting of transurethral resection with chemoradiation. Advanced disease is best treated with systemic cisplatin-based chemotherapy; immunotherapy is emerging as a viable salvage treatment for patients in whom first-line chemotherapy cannot control the disease. Developments in the past 2 years have shed light on genetic subtypes of bladder cancer that might differ from one another in response to various treatments.

The heterogenous nature of high-risk nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer encompasses a wide range of tumor biologies with varying recurrence and progression risks. Radical cystectomy provides excellent oncologic outcomes but is often underutilized. Timing for these patients is critical, however, to its effectiveness. Certain unfavorable tumor characteristics predict worse outcomes and may help select the most appropriate patients for more aggressive initial therapy. This manuscript aims to outline factors that predict worse outcomes in high-risk nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer and proposes which patients may benefit most from a timely radical cystectomy.

### Diagnosis and treatment of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer: AUA / SUO guideline: 2024 amendment [^116JbLLV]. The Journal of Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The purpose of this American Urological Association (AUA)/Society of Urologic Oncology (SUO) guideline amendment is to provide a useful reference on the effective evidence-based treatment strategies for non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC).

Materials and Methods

In 2023, the NMIBC guideline was updated through the AUA amendment process in which newly published literature is reviewed and integrated into previously published guidelines in an effort to maintain currency. The amendment allowed for the incorporation of additional literature released since the previous 2020 amendment. The updated search gathered literature from July 2019 to May 2023. This review identified 1918 abstracts, of which 75 met inclusion criteria. When sufficient evidence existed, the body of evidence was assigned a strength rating of A (high), B (moderate), or C (low) in support of Strong, Moderate, or Conditional Recommendations. In the absence of sufficient evidence, additional information is provided as Clinical Principles and Expert Opinions.

Results

Updates were made to statements on variant histologies, urine markers after diagnosis of bladder cancer, intravesical therapy, BCG maintenance, enhanced cystoscopy, and future directions. Further revisions were made to the methodology and reference sections as appropriate.

Conclusions

This guideline seeks to improve clinicians' ability to evaluate and treat patients with NMIBC based on currently available evidence. Future studies will be essential to further support or refine these statements to improve patient care.

### European Association of Urology guidelines on muscle-invasive and metastatic bladder cancer: summary of the 2020 guidelines [^113ERhVC]. European Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

Context

This overview presents the updated European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines for muscle-invasive and metastatic bladder cancer (MMIBC).

Objective

To provide practical evidence-based recommendations and consensus statements on the clinical management of MMIBC with a focus on diagnosis and treatment.

Evidence Acquisition

A broad and comprehensive scoping exercise covering all areas of the MMIBC guideline has been performed annually since its 2017 publication (based on the 2016 guideline). Databases covered by the search included Medline, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Libraries, resulting in yearly guideline updates. A level of evidence and a grade of recommendation were assigned. Additionally, the results of a collaborative multistakeholder consensus project on advanced bladder cancer (BC) have been incorporated in the 2020 guidelines, addressing those areas where it is unlikely that prospective comparative studies will be conducted.

Evidence Synthesis

Variant histologies are increasingly reported in invasive BC and are relevant for treatment and prognosis. Staging is preferably done with (enhanced) computerised tomography scanning. Treatment decisions are still largely based on clinical factors. Radical cystectomy (RC) with lymph node dissection remains the recommended treatment in highest-risk non-muscle-invasive and muscle-invasive nonmetastatic BC, preceded by cisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) for invasive tumours in "fit" patients. Selected men and women benefit from sexuality sparing RC, although this is not recommended as standard therapy. Open and robotic RC show comparable outcomes, provided the procedure is performed in experienced centres. For open RC 10, the minimum selected case load is 10 procedures per year. If bladder preservation is considered, chemoradiation is an alternative in well-selected patients without carcinoma in situ and after maximal resection. Adjuvant chemotherapy should be considered if no NAC was given. Perioperative immunotherapy can be offered in clinical trial setting. For fit metastatic patients, cisplatin-based chemotherapy remains the first choice. In cisplatin-ineligible patients, immunotherapy in Programmed Death Ligand 1 (PD-L1)-positive patients or carboplatin in PD-L1-negative patients is recommended. For second-line treatment in metastatic disease, pembrolizumab is recommended. Postchemotherapy surgery may prolong survival in responders. Quality of life should be monitored in all phases of treatment and follow-up. The extended version of the guidelines is available at the EAU website: https://uroweb.org/guideline/bladder-cancer-muscle-invasive-and-metastatic/.

Conclusions

This summary of the 2020 EAU MMIBC guideline provides updated information on the diagnosis and treatment of MMIBC for incorporation into clinical practice.

Patient Summary

The European Association of Urology Muscle-invasive and Metastatic Bladder Cancer (MMIBC) Panel has released an updated version of their guideline, which contains information on histology, staging, prognostic factors, and treatment of MMIBC. The recommendations are based on the current literature (until the end of 2019), with emphasis on high-level data from randomised clinical trials and meta-analyses and on the findings of an international consensus meeting. Surgical removal of the bladder and bladder preservation are discussed, as well as the use of chemotherapy and immunotherapy in localised and metastatic disease.

### A review of current guidelines and best practice recommendations for the management of nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer by the international bladder cancer group [^114i5rma]. The Journal of Urology (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

Although the European Association of Urology, First International Consultation on Bladder Tumors, National Comprehensive Cancer Network and American Urological Association guidelines all provide an excellent evidence-based framework for the management of nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer, these guidelines vary with respect to important issues such as risk level definitions and management strategies for these risk categories. Therefore, we built on the existing framework provided by current guidelines, and provide consensus on the definitions of low, intermediate and high risk nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer, as well as practical recommendations for the treatment of patients in each of these risk categories.

Materials and Methods

An international committee of experts on bladder cancer management identified and analyzed the European Association of Urology, First International Consultation on Bladder Tumors, National Comprehensive Cancer Network and American Urological Association guidelines as well as the published English language literature related to the treatment and management of nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer available as of April 2010.

Results

Based on review of the current guidelines and literature, the International Bladder Cancer Group developed practical recommendations for the management of nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer.

Conclusions

Complete transurethral bladder tumor resection is recommended for all patients with nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer. For low risk disease a single, immediate chemotherapeutic instillation after transurethral bladder tumor resection is recommended. For intermediate or high risk disease there is no significant benefit from an immediate, postoperative chemotherapeutic instillation. For intermediate risk disease intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guérin with maintenance or intravesical chemotherapy is recommended. For high risk disease bacillus Calmette-Guérin induction plus maintenance is recommended. The appropriate management of recurrence depends on the patient level of risk as well as previous treatment, while the management of treatment failure depends on the type of failure as well as the level of risk for recurrence and disease progression.

### What is bladder cancer?-NCI… [^1168WWfF]. NCI (2023). Medium credibility.

What Is Bladder Cancer. Bladder cancer occurs when cells in the bladder start to grow without control. The bladder is a hollow, balloon-shaped organ in the lower part of the abdomen that stores urine. The bladder has a muscular wall that allows it to get larger to store urine made by the kidneys and to shrink to squeeze urine out of the body. There are two kidneys, one on each side of the backbone, above the waist. The bladder and kidneys work together to remove toxins and wastes from your body through urine:

- Tiny tubules in the kidneys filter and clean the blood.
- These tubules take out waste products and make urine.
- The urine passes from each kidney through a long tube called a ureter into the bladder.
- The bladder holds the urine until it passes through a tube called the urethra and leaves the body.

Types of bladder cancer Urothelial carcinoma is cancer that begins in the urothelial cells, which line the urethra, bladder, ureters, renal pelvis, and some other organs. Almost all bladder cancers are urothelial carcinomas. Urothelial cells are also called transitional cells because they change shape. These cells are able to stretch when the bladder is full of urine and shrink when it is emptied. Other types of bladder cancer are rare: Squamous cell carcinomais cancer that begins in squamous cells. This type of cancer may form after long-term irritation or infection with a tropical parasite called schistosomiasis, which is common in Africa and the Middle East but rare in the United States. When chronic irritation occurs, transitional cells that line the bladder can gradually change to squamous cells.

Adenocarcinomais cancer that begins in glandular cells that are found in the lining of the bladder. Glandular cells in the bladder make mucus and other substances. Small cell carcinoma of the bladderis cancer that begins in neuroendocrine cells. There are other ways to describe bladder cancer: Non-muscle-invasive bladder canceris cancer that has not reached the muscle wall of the bladder. Most bladder cancers are non-muscle-invasive. Muscle-invasive bladder canceris cancer that has spread through the lining of the bladder and into the muscle wall of the bladder or beyond it.

### Bladder cancer causes and risk factors-NCI… [^114rjdB3]. NCI (2023). Medium credibility.

Bladder Cancer Causes and Risk Factors Bladder cancer is caused by certain changes in how bladder cells function, especially how they grow and divide into new cells. There are many risk factors for bladder cancer, but many do not directly cause cancer. Instead, they increase the chance of DNA damage in cells that may lead to bladder cancer. Learn more about how cancer develops at What Is Cancer. A risk factor is anything that increases the chance of getting a disease. Some risk factors for bladder cancer, like using tobacco, can be changed. Risk factors also include things people cannot change, like their age and family history. It's important to learn about risk factors for bladder cancer because it can help you make choices that might lower your risk of getting it. Risk factors for bladder cancer In the United States, bladder cancer occurs more often in men than in women, and more often in White individuals than in Black individuals.

Bladder cancer can be diagnosed at any age, but the risk increases as a person gets older. Using tobacco, especially smoking cigarettes, is a major risk factor for bladder cancer. Tobacco contains harmful chemicals called carcinogens. When you use tobacco, these chemicals get absorbed into the bloodstream, are filtered by the kidneys, and then collect in the urine. This exposes your bladder to high levels of these chemicals, which can damage the DNA in the cells lining your bladder. Learn about different tools to help you quit smoking and how to use them.

Other risk factors for bladder cancer include:

- having a family history of bladder cancer
- having certain changes in the genes that are linked to bladder cancer, such as HRAS, RB1, PTEN/MMAC1, NAT2, and GSTM1
- being exposed to paints, dyes, metals, or petroleum products in the workplace
- past treatment with radiation therapy to the pelvis or with certain anticancer drugs, such as cyclophosphamide or ifosfamide
- taking the Chinese herb. Aristolochia fangchi
- drinking water from a well that has high levels of arsenic
- drinking water that has been treated with chlorine
- having a bladder infection caused by a parasite called Schistosoma haematobium, which is common in Africa and the Middle East but rare in the United States.
