## Question

A 42-year-old man presents to your clinic with a 2-year history of chronic low back pain that has not responded to conservative treatments including physical therapy, NSAIDs, and activity modification. MRI shows degenerative disc disease at L4-L5 without significant nerve root compression. He is interested in minimally invasive procedures and asks about options for pain relief. You are considering intradiscal procedures to address his discogenic pain.

Based on current guidelines, which intradiscal procedures could you consider offering this patient, and what should you communicate regarding their expected effectiveness?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which intradiscal procedures could be considered for a 42-year-old man with chronic low back pain from L4-L5 degenerative disc disease, and what to communicate about their expected effectiveness. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and ensuring the patient truly has discogenic pain. Then, I should verify which intradiscal therapies have the strongest guideline support and which are experimental. Next, I will appraise the evidence quality and quantify expected benefits using validated responder thresholds. After that, I need to check safety, contraindications, and regulatory status. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise recommendation and counseling points, including what to avoid and how to monitor outcomes.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic frame. Chronic axial low back pain with MRI evidence of degenerative disc disease at L4-L5 and no significant nerve root compression fits a discogenic pain phenotype, but I should not jump to conclusions without aligning clinical features such as midline pain, sitting intolerance, and pain with flexion, and ideally confirming the pain generator with provocative discography when appropriate, because discography remains the most specific test for identifying a painful disc when a treatment target is needed [^6a171cc3] [^5535b2ab] [^e18828bd].

> Next, I should review which intradiscal therapies have the most consistent guideline support. Intradiscal biacuplasty (cooled radiofrequency) has the most favorable recent guidance, with NASS suggesting it as an option for clinically and statistically significant pain improvement at 6 months in carefully selected discogenic pain patients, supported by a multicenter randomized trial showing greater pain reduction versus conventional medical management, albeit with limited functional gains at 6 months [^c3375853] [^495e898e] [^d8268b33].

> Hold on, let's not conflate different thermal annular procedures. IDET has older, mixed evidence and is not uniformly endorsed; NASS allows consideration with modest expectations, but ACOEM recommends against IDET, so I should present IDET cautiously and emphasize its limited and inconsistent benefit profile compared with biacuplasty [^1f25c015] [^2d0ff22c] [^a9357642].

> I will now examine regenerative biologics. PRP and MSCs show promise, but I need to be precise about evidence quality. NASS 2020 judges the evidence insufficient to recommend for or against PRP, bone marrow concentrate, or methylene blue for discogenic pain, whereas ASPN 2022 suggests considering PRP and MSCs in selected patients after multidisciplinary care failure, reflecting a more permissive stance in expert consensus rather than high-certainty evidence [^6d1636e3] [^b0b91c08] [^1d3b56ce].

> Wait, let me verify the magnitude of benefit for biologics so I don't overstate expectations. Meta-analytic and systematic reviews suggest approximately 54–55% of patients achieve substantial clinical benefit (≥ 50% pain reduction) at 6 months for both MSCs and PRP, but the evidence base is largely Level III, heterogeneous, and often unblinded, so I should communicate these as promising but unproven options with uncertain durability beyond 1–2 years [^9b0d90ad] [^3429c0aa] [^6bf81e8f].

> I should double-check intradiscal steroids. The balance of evidence and guidelines indicates no benefit for routine discogenic pain without Modic changes, and professional societies advise against offering intradiscal corticosteroids for chronic nonradicular low back pain; steroids may help short term only when Modic changes are present, which is not this patient's profile [^dbee29fe] [^c523ea9a] [^47fa9b8f].

> Let me consider patient selection and safety. Ideal candidates have chronic axial pain ≥ 3–6 months, preserved disc height (> 60%), concordant pain on low-pressure discography, no neurologic deficits, and no infection risk; rare complications include discitis, so strict aseptic technique and infection risk mitigation are essential, and I should confirm these criteria before proceeding [^6a171cc3] [^f714a285].

> I need to ensure regulatory and practical clarity. PRP and bone marrow concentrate are generally considered 361 tissue products and exempt from FDA drug/device regulation, whereas cultured MSC products are regulated as 351 biologics and none are FDA-approved for discogenic pain; this affects availability and should be discussed transparently with the patient [^ec4e97bf].

> Next, I should review how to measure success. I will use responder thresholds anchored to patient-centered outcomes: ≥ 30% pain reduction for minimal clinically important difference, ≥ 50% for substantial clinical benefit, and a patient-acceptable symptomatic state of VAS ≤ 3, with reassessment at 6 months to decide on continuation or escalation, aligning with contemporary discogenic pain algorithms [^9aa72646] [^c97450d4].

> Putting this together, my hierarchy is as follows: biacuplasty is the most defensible first-line intradiscal option given recent positive RCT data and guideline endorsement, with counseling that roughly 40–60% achieve meaningful pain reduction at 6 months but functional gains are modest and durability beyond 2 years is uncertain; PRP or MSCs can be considered experimental options in specialized centers after shared decision-making, with about a 50–55% chance of substantial benefit at 6 months but low-certainty evidence and variable regulatory access; IDET is not routinely recommended given conflicting data and professional opposition; intradiscal steroids should be avoided in the absence of Modic changes [^c3375853] [^495e898e] [^9b0d90ad] [^a9357642] [^c523ea9a].

> But wait, what if the pain is not purely discogenic? I should confirm that facet and sacroiliac sources have been reasonably excluded, because these are common mimics; if uncertainty remains, diagnostic blocks can refine the pain generator before committing to intradiscal therapy, which improves the likelihood of response and avoids unnecessary procedures [^f48fbb52] [^86276219].

> Finally, I will outline the plan and counseling. We will proceed with confirmatory diagnostic workup, including provocative discography if appropriate, then offer biacuplasty as the preferred intradiscal option with transparent discussion of expected benefits, risks, and the need for structured rehabilitation; if biacuplasty is unavailable or declined, we can discuss PRP or MSCs as investigational alternatives within a registry or trial framework, and if all intradiscal options fail, we will pivot to multidisciplinary pain management and surgical consultation for motion-preserving options or basivertebral nerve ablation if Modic changes emerge [^c3375853] [^1d3b56ce] [^cb0c5fdd].

For a 42-year-old with chronic L4-L5 discogenic pain refractory to conservative care, **intradiscal biacuplasty is the most evidence-supported option** [^c3375853], with a multicenter RCT showing significant pain reduction at 6 months versus medical management, though functional gains are modest and durability beyond 2 years is uncertain [^495e898e] [^2d0ff22c]. IDET may be considered in select patients, but **evidence is mixed and less robust** [^cc0ed873] [^a9357642]. Intradiscal PRP and MSCs are promising but remain investigational, with limited high-quality evidence and no definitive long-term data [^6d1636e3] [^6bf81e8f]. Intradiscal steroids are not recommended for pure discogenic pain without Modic changes [^b0b91c08] [^c523ea9a]. Counsel that biacuplasty offers about a 50–60% chance of clinically meaningful pain relief at 6 months, with low complication rates, but **insurance coverage is variable** and patient selection is key [^e22175fb] [^6a171cc3].

## Intradiscal procedures with supportive evidence

Key characteristics of intradiscal procedures:

| **Aspect** | **Intradiscal biacuplasty** | **Intradiscal electrothermal therapy (idet)** | **Intradiscal regenerative therapies (prp, mscs)** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Mechanism | Cooled radiofrequency ablation of the posterior annulus to modulate nociceptors and stabilize the disc [^notfound]. | Thermal coagulation of the annulus to denervate pain fibers and stabilize the disc [^notfound]. | Biological restoration of disc matrix and reduction of inflammation [^e28d56b6]. |
| Evidence | Multicenter RCT showed significant pain reduction at 6 months vs medical management; NASS gives a Grade C recommendation [^c3375853] [^d8268b33]. | Mixed evidence; some studies report 40–50% pain reduction, others show no benefit; NASS gives a Grade B recommendation with limited effectiveness [^2d0ff22c] [^1f25c015]. | Early studies suggest pain and function improvements, but high-quality RCTs are limited; NASS gives a Grade I (insufficient) recommendation [^6d1636e3] [^b0b91c08]. |
| Effectiveness | ~50–60% achieve ≥ 50% pain relief at 6 months; durability beyond 2 years is uncertain [^e22175fb] [^2d0ff22c]. | ~40–50% achieve ≥ 50% pain relief at 6–12 months; durability varies [^a0b5d017] [^ec3467c9]. | ~50–60% report clinically meaningful improvement at 6–12 months; long-term durability unknown [^9b0d90ad] [^3429c0aa]. |
| Safety | Low complication rates; rare discitis or transient radiculitis reported [^8048b070] [^3c358db6]. | Low complication rates; rare discitis, catheter breakage, or nerve injury reported [^3c358db6]. | Generally safe; rare discitis or transient pain flares reported [^f714a285]. |

## Intradiscal procedures not recommended

Intradiscal corticosteroids are **not recommended for pure discogenic pain without Modic changes**, as evidence shows no significant benefit over placebo [^b0b91c08] [^dbee29fe]. Percutaneous intradiscal radiofrequency thermocoagulation (discTRODE) is also not recommended due to insufficient evidence and lack of benefit in RCTs [^a4d957a8] [^8e8a1fae].

---

## Patient selection criteria

Appropriate patient selection is critical for optimal outcomes. Recommended criteria include:

- **Chronic axial low back pain** ≥ 6 months refractory to conservative therapy [^6a171cc3].
- **MRI evidence** of degenerative disc disease with ≥ 60% residual disc height [^6a171cc3].
- **Positive concordant discography** at low pressure [^6a171cc3].
- **Normal neurologic exam** without radiculopathy [^6a171cc3].
- **Absence of Modic changes** (except for steroid injections) [^b0b91c08].

---

## Clinical outcomes and durability

- **Biacuplasty**: Clinically meaningful pain relief in ~50–60% at 6 months; durability beyond 2 years is uncertain [^e22175fb] [^2d0ff22c].
- **IDET**: ~40–50% achieve ≥ 50% pain relief at 6–12 months; durability varies [^a0b5d017] [^ec3467c9].
- **PRP/MSCs**: ~50–60% report clinically meaningful improvement at 6–12 months; long-term durability unknown [^9b0d90ad] [^3429c0aa].

---

## Potential risks and complications

All intradiscal procedures carry **low but nontrivial risks**, including:

- **Discitis**: Rare but serious infection [^3c358db6].
- **Nerve injury**: Transient radiculopathy or rare permanent deficit [^3c358db6].
- **Catheter breakage**: Rare with IDET [^3c358db6].
- **Pain flare**: Transient increase in pain post-procedure [^f714a285].

---

## Insurance coverage and accessibility

Coverage varies by payer and region; **biacuplasty and IDET are more likely to be covered** than regenerative therapies, which are often considered investigational and may require prior authorization or be self-pay [^notfound].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Procedure** | **Recommendation** | **Evidence level** | **Expected outcomes** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Intradiscal biacuplasty | Recommended | Grade C | 50–60% pain relief at 6 months |
| IDET | Considered in select patients | Grade B | 40–50% pain relief at 6–12 months |
| PRP/MSCs | Investigational | Grade I | 50–60% improvement at 6–12 months |
| Intradiscal steroids | Not recommended | Grade I | No benefit in pure discogenic pain |

---

Intradiscal biacuplasty is the **most evidence-supported option** for this patient, with a reasonable chance of pain relief and low risk; IDET is a secondary option with mixed evidence; PRP/MSCs are promising but investigational; steroids are not recommended without Modic changes.

Intradiscal biacuplasty versus conventional medical management randomized trial — In a multicenter randomized controlled trial in lumbar discogenic pain, outcomes were assessed at baseline and after 6 months, with responders defined as a 2-point or 30% decrease in VAS scores; the intradiscal biacuplasty group experienced significantly greater pain reduction compared to conventional medical management alone, and this study provides Level I evidence that biacuplasty provides statistically significant improvements in pain, but no statistically significant improvement in function as compared with conservative management at 6 months.

Clinical Success Criteria

To evaluate the clinical effectiveness of first line intradiscal therapies, we recommend the periodic evaluation of all patients to assess the magnitude of symptom change and whether additional tests or procedures are warranted. The treatment goal should determine whether patients have achieved a clinically significant outcome within 6 months of the index intervention (Figure 1, Box 8). At a minimum, patients should be queried regarding the current severity of their low back pain. Comparison of baseline pre procedure pain severity status with scores reported at clinical followup should employ the MCID and optionally, substantial clinical benefit (SCB), and the patient acceptable symptomatic state (PASS). For discogenic low back pain, the validated MCID reflects a ≥ 30% improvement over baseline, the SCB represents ≥ 50% improvement, and the PASS threshold is ≤ 3. In this algorithm, the panel recommends that, at a minimum, the MCID be used to determine patient success and guide subsequent therapeutic interventions.

Clinical Scenario A 42-year-old man presents with a one-day history of moderately severe low back pain that began after he bent over to pick up a newspaper. Clinical Question Are nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs an effective treatment for low back pain. Evidence-Based Answer Patients can expect a modest improvement in global function with NSAID therapy, such as ibuprofen. There is no evidence that any particular NSAID or combination of medicines has superior efficacy in the treatment of low back pain. Cochrane Abstract Worldwide, NSAIDs are the most frequently prescribed medications and are widely used to treat low back pain. Background. The objective of this systematic review was to assess the effects of NSAIDs in the treatment of nonspecific low back pain and to assess which type of NSAID is most effective. Objective.

The authors searched the Medline and Embase databases and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register up to and including September 1998 if reported in English, Dutch, or German. The authors also screened references given in relevant reviews and identified trials. Search Strategy. Randomized trials and double-blind controlled trials of NSAIDs in nonspecific low back pain with or without pain radiating to the legs were included. Selection Criteria. Two reviewers, blinded with respect to authors, institution, and journal, independently extracted data and assessed methodologic quality. A methodologic quality score was applied, and studies meeting at least six of 11 specified criteria were considered high-quality studies. If data were considered clinically homogeneous, a meta-analysis was performed using a fixed effects model for statistically homogeneous subgroups and a random effects model for statistically heterogeneous subgroups. Data Collection and Analysis.

If data were considered clinically heterogeneous, a qualitative analysis was performed using a rating system with four levels of evidence. A total of 51 trials were included in this review, of which 46 were published in English and five in German. Sixteen trials were of high quality. The pooled relative risk for global improvement after one week was 1. 24 and for additional analgesic use it was

1. 29, indicating a statistically significant effect in favor of NSAIDs compared to placebo. The results of the qualitative analysis showed that there is conflicting evidence that NSAIDs are more effective than acetaminophen for treatment of acute low back pain, and that there is moderate evidence that NSAIDs are not more effective than other drugs for treatment of acute low back pain.

There is strong evidence that various types of NSAIDs are equally effective for treatment of acute low back pain. Primary Results. The evidence from the 51 trials included in this review suggests that NSAIDs are effective for short-term symptomatic relief in patients with acute low back pain. There does not seem to be a specific type of NSAID that is clearly more effective than others. Sufficient evidence on treatment of chronic low back pain is still lacking. Reviewers' Conclusions. The Cochrane Abstract is a summary of a review from the Cochrane Library. It is accompanied by an interpretation to help clinicians put evidence into practice. Glenn Griffin, M. D. M. Sc. M. Ed. Fred Tudiver, M. D. C. C. F. P. F. C. F. P., and William D. Grant, Ed. D., present a clinical scenario and clinical question based on the Cochrane Abstract, along with evidence-based answers and a full critique of the abstract. Were the results similar from study to study. No.

Discogenic low back pain is a common musculoskeletal complaint in patients presenting to orthopaedic surgeons. In addition to surgical options, there are several nonsurgical intradiscal treatments that have gained interest, ranging from biologic, nonbiologic, cell-based, and molecular therapies. However, there is limited evidence for many of these techniques, and some are still in the clinical trial stage. We describe a broad overview of these intradiscal therapies, the mechanism of action, and the evidence behind them.

Core Evidence

There have been a large number of pilot investigations of the clinical effectiveness of intradiscal cell-based therapies. While the findings of most reports suggest a positive treatment effect, their applicability is highly restricted due to extremely low sample sizes (ie, < 10 cases) often generated by a single investigator from a single center. These important limitations are further compounded by lack of standardization of the intervention and variable reporting of relevant outcomes such as pain severity and functional improvement. These methodological shortcomings are likely reflective of what might be expected at the advent of any new family of therapeutic interventions, particularly in an unregulated setting. More rarely, there have been reports of initially promising cell-based intradiscal injectables that have failed to induce a durable treatment effect, with the subsequent cessation of trials due to futility.

We have summarized below the core evidence for MSCs, PRPs, and NPs drawn from the most methodologically rigorous studies and meta-analyses.

### Perspective on intradiscal therapies for lumbar discogenic pain: state of the science, knowledge gaps, and imperatives for clinical adoption [^90fd5e90]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

The expanding use of "big data", including information gleaned from electronic health records, large observational cohorts, and patient registries, presents unique opportunities to conduct large-scale studies with many of the benefits of randomized trials but without the inherent difficulties.

In closing, the interest in the development of effective methods to treat intervertebral disc degeneration is genuine and the enthusiasm around the compendium of core evidence generated to date is warranted. However, until further clinical results become available, we believe it is prudent to maintain cautious skepticism about the viability of these products to provide sustained and durable efficacy in the harsh intradiscal microenvironment. As stated herein, we propose a more thorough and comprehensive analysis and standardized presentation of clinical findings, which would measurably assist in validating the clinical utility of these promising interventions.

Therapy Grading

Intradiscal regenerative therapy is burgeoning area of research and intervention. Different than interventions in the previous sections that have established histories with decades of experience, this intervention category is relatively recently introduced into the lexicon of therapeutic intervention. As a result, there is one RCT and several observational studies and case series which are utilized to form recommendations. Table 9 summarizes the current literature on this family of interventions and Table 10 summarizes those recommendations. There is evidence for the use of intradiscal PRP in the form of a single RCT, and several prospective observational studies and case series for both autologous bone marrow and adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells, as well as allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells and cellular allograft disc matrix for the treatment of persistent lumbar discogenic back pain. It is important to discern that the primary patient populations studied have previously failed the multidisciplinary standard of care. Regenerative Medicine holds the potential to provide an alternative intervention for these patients whose pain persists despite the recommended conservative management. In these selected patients, intradiscal biologics may improve pain and function without the need for advanced surgical treatments that can impair the spine's native biomechanics (Table 10).

### Effectiveness of intradiscal regenerative medicine therapies for long-term relief of chronic low back pain: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^3429c0aa]. Pain Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Recent research underscores the potential of intradiscal biologics, such as mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), platelet-rich plasma (PRP), and alpha-2-macroglobulin, in promoting chondrogenesis within lumbar intervertebral discs as a treatment for discogenic low back pain. Studies indicate significant improvements in pain relief, physical function, and overall quality of life following these interventions.

Objective

This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of intradiscal injections of MSCs and PRP in managing low back and lower extremity pain. A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to assess the outcomes of these treatments.

Study Design

A systematic review and meta-analysis evaluating the efficacy of PRP and MSC injections for discogenic low back and lower extremity pain.

Data Sources

The review included literature from PubMed, Cochrane Library, the U.S. National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC), prior systematic reviews, and reference lists, covering studies from 1966 to September 2024.

Study Selection

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), observational studies, and case reports focusing on biologic injections into the disc were included.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Data were extracted and assessed for methodological quality. Evidence was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria and summarized based on best evidence synthesis principles on a 1-to-5 scale.

Results

The analysis included 8 RCTs (4 evaluating PRP, 5 evaluating MSCs) and 8 observational studies (4 assessing PRP, 4 assessing MSCs) for managing chronic low back pain. Evidence quality was deemed fair (Level III) with limited certainty and moderate recommendation strength based on qualitative and quantitative analyses.

Limitations

Paucity of high-quality studies.

Conclusion

This systematic review and single-arm meta-analysis suggest that intradiscal injections of MSCs and PRP may be effective in managing discogenic low back pain, supported by Level III evidence.

Interpretation & Conclusions

Intradiscal therapies have shown great promise in the treatment of lumbar discogenic pain. The primary objective of these interventions is to repair, rejuvenate, and restore the damaged intervertebral disc and, in doing so, eliminate the source of the discogenic pain. That said, disc degeneration is an almost ubiquitous finding with aging in the human spine and the same aberrant biomechanical forces that caused the initial damage still exist. This dilemma poses several important research questions. How long can the effects of a regenerative therapy stave off the inevitable degeneration? Can a re-damaged disc be treated again? Does disc regeneration also slow the progression of arthritic degeneration in adjacent areas of the motion segment, particularly the facet joints?

Due to the methodological shortcomings (ie, small sample sizes, etc.) associated with many of the reports of intradiscal therapies, there has been a clarion call for additional randomized controlled trials (preferably sham-controlled). Indeed, the lack of high-grade clinical evidence from trials with a prospective randomized, double-blinded study design is often cited as a primary reason for rejecting proposed therapy advances in orthopedic surgery. While we would not argue that randomized sham-controlled trials provide the highest level of clinical evidence, we do not believe that they are necessary to infer safety and effectiveness. Although percutaneous interventions may be easier to sham than other spinal surgical procedures, we submit that sham-controlled trials are most valuable for interventions where devices are genuinely new and claim to offer measurable therapeutic benefits. When this is not the case, as with many commercially available products that already have regulatory clearance, randomized controlled trials may be inappropriate and wasteful. In fact, the majority of randomized interventional trials (~75%) designed to guide clinical practice possess pitfalls that have compromised their ability to do so.

Diagnosis & treatment of low back pain — interventional treatment, intradiscal bone marrow concentrate: There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against the use of intradiscal bone marrow concentrate in patients with discogenic low back pain. Grade of Recommendation: I. In a feasibility cohort including candidates with discogenic low back pain for at least 6 months and modified Pfirrmann grade IV–VII (n = 26), disability and pain were measured prior to injection and 3, 6, 12 and 24 months after treatment; Twenty-four patients avoided surgery for 12 months; 21 avoided surgery throughout the 24–month follow-up period, and Level IV evidence indicates intradiscal injection of autologous bone marrow concentrate may provide reductions in back pain and disability at 2 years.

Interventional treatment — in patients with Modic changes, intradiscal steroids are suggested to provide short-term improvements in pain and function in patients with Modic changes. Grade of Recommendation: B. A double-blind, randomized, controlled, prospective clinical study in degenerative chronic discogenic low back pain with endplate Modic changes recorded pain and disability at 3 and 6 months, found that subgroups 2 and 3 had significant improvements in pain and disability at both follow-up points, and provides Level I evidence that intradiscal steroid injections can provide pain relief in patients with single level Modic changes and positive provocative discography with contrast contained within the disc space for up to 6 months. An additional study of chronic low back pain with inflammatory Modic changes classified patients as Modic type I (n = 37), Modic 1–2 (n = 25) and Modic II-1 (n = 12), all of whom received a lumbar intradiscal injection of corticosteroids and reported pain intensity before and one, three and six months after injection.

Abstract

Specific clinical diagnostic criteria have established a consensus for defining patients with lumbar discogenic pain. However, if conservative medical management fails, these patients have few treatment options short of surgery involving discectomy often coupled with fusion or arthroplasty. There is a rapidly-emerging research effort to fill this treatment gap with intradiscal therapies that can be delivered minimally-invasively via fluoroscopically guided injection without altering the normal anatomy of the affected vertebral motion segment. Viable candidate products to date have included mesenchymal stromal cells, platelet-rich plasma, nucleus pulposus structural allograft, and other cell-based compositions. The objective of these products is to repair, supplement, and restore the damaged intervertebral disc as well as retard further degeneration. In doing so, the intervention is meant to eliminate the source of discogenic pain and avoid surgery.

Formulations of allogeneic NP cells also contain a heterogeneous cell population of native cells residing in the NP including highly differentiated rounded NP cells and undifferentiated progenitor cells. However, unlike MSCs, NP cells are endemic to the intervertebral disc, rendering them likely more adaptive to survival within this inhospitable microenvironment. Since NP transplant is directly homologous (ie, disc tissue to disc tissue), product standardization may focus more on donor selection and procurement procedures.

Finally, it is important to characterize the role of carriers and scaffolds such as hydrogels used as delivery vehicles for cell- and tissue-based treatments to support intradiscal cell viability. The role of potential biomaterial scaffolds in cell survival, proliferation, and tissue regeneration is currently unknown, necessitating a more thorough investigation.

With respect to the standardization of patient-reported outcomes, we recommend a small, but well-validated, battery of outcome measures that include, at a minimum, low back pain severity, which is the cardinal discogenic symptom as well as corresponding referred leg pain severity, if present. The degree of functional impairment should also be evaluated preferably using the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). These two outcome measures represent the core instruments for reporting clinical effectiveness findings for study populations. Although not mandatory, it is suggested that a quality-of-life metric be included, such as the SF-12 or the EQ-5D, to support subsequent cost-utility analyses.

While our understanding of pathological disc degeneration is extensive, investigation of the mechanism of action for intradiscal therapies to manage discogenic pain has been limited and, thus, treatment protocols remain correspondingly empiric. As noted previously, cell-based treatments may possess multiple characteristics that impart a beneficial effect via biochemical and/or structural pathways that can be identified preliminarily via animal models. However, it is crucial to confirm the mechanism of action for each product in humans to account for their unique spinal anatomy, where orthograde posture and obligate bipedalism are antecedent to disc degeneration itself and may compromise product durability.

To date, studies of intradiscal restorative therapies have employed a single bolus injection technique. It is not clear whether this method maximizes efficacy or whether periodic and fractional treatment might afford a greater degree and duration of disc restoration and symptom amelioration. As an example, we currently have limited knowledge of alternative delivery protocols using exact-dosing injection regimens at multiple sites and different locations within the intervertebral disc.

Intradiscal Regenerative Therapies

The intervertebral disc plays a crucial role in the health of the spine complex. Several pathologies of the disc itself, including internal disc disruption, tears, degeneration, and loss of height can all predispose patients to discogenic back pain and its sequelae. The disc is a central part of the interconnected biomechanical system of the spine, which allows for mobility and distribution of stress. Degeneration often correlates with loss of disc height that can lead to excess motion and instability. While this review will focus on treating pain originating from the disc itself, damage to the disc may lead to excess forces and subsequent damage throughout the spine.

The disc is a sensitive environment as it depends on diffusion for nutrients and waste movement due to its avascular nature at baseline. This diffusion capacity is relatively poor and worsens with both increasing age and pathology. In healthy discs, nerve endings are limited to the outer one-third of the disc and are not found in the inner annulus or nucleus pulposus region. In degenerated discs, nociceptive nerve fibers along with vasculature may migrate into the central disc regions. It is theorized that neurotransmitters together with changes within the extracellular matrix itself and the release of cytokines regulate this nerve ingrowth. In addition, pain-related peptides and proinflammatory cytokines are increased.

A common cause of disc failure is overloading in which forces may lead to desiccation of the disc and annular tears. The disc itself has a limited compression capacity which worsens with decreasing fluid content. To improve disc failure, the premise is to regain or maintain disc height to reduce the axial nerve compression and to restore the tissue dynamics (fluid content) of the annulus. A second goal is to possibly reconstitute the central nucleus with a matrix environment that can hold fluid and improve nutritional flow. Using regenerative medicine, the hope is to improve the damaged internal environment of the disc by reconstituting a matrix that may improve and return disc function.

Indications

Intradiscal regenerative medicine has primarily been studied in patients with intractable chronic LBP for at least 3–6 months despite failure of a multi-modal treatment approach including indicated medications, physical therapy, and other interventional procedures as per recommendation guidelines. Patients should have history, physical exam, and radiologic findings consistent with their symptomatic lumbar intervertebral discogenic pain. Provocative discography can further specify the source of pain and the precise level(s) to treat.

The overriding challenge for these intradiscal agents to impart a restorative effect lies in the very nature of the intervertebral disc itself. As a result of its distinctly complex developmental origin and tissue composition, the mature intervertebral disc is essentially avascular, aneural, and alymphatic in nature, creating a hostile microenvironment for regeneration to occur and flourish. Consequently, for an injectable cell product to provide tangible and durable clinical benefit, it will need to embody some or preferably all of a variety of pro-regenerative characteristics to maximize the likelihood of efficacy. These characteristics include, but are not limited to, (1) engrafting with a capacity to survive for an adequate period of time to directly contribute to matrix production, (2) having the potential to generate robust paracrine signaling to induce an anabolic switch in native cells to alter their behavior from degeneration to regeneration, (3) support the recruitment of regenerative cell types or otherwise limit the migration of fibrotic/catabolic cells into the disc, and (4) provide intradiscal structural and mechanical support that supplements volume loss and facilitates re-hydration.

This commentary provides a perspective on the state of the science of intradiscal therapies aimed at ameliorating discogenic low back pain. We address the salient regulatory hurdles as well as the core evidence, knowledge gaps, and imperatives necessary to establish clinical utility.

Study Design

A systematic review of the medical literature regarding current intradiscal therapeutic methods.

Objectives

To establish an understanding of the current intradiscal treatment options for the management of low back pain.

Summary Of Background Data

Current treatment of intradiscal disease is rapidly evolving and as such should be a multidisciplinary effort that follows a logical, orderly algorithm. Minimally invasive techniques, namely, intradiscal electrothermal therapy (IDET), radiofrequency ablation (RFA), percutaneous endoscopic laser discectomy (PELD), and cryoablation have challenged the conventional surgical management of back pain.

Methods

Thirty-eight research reports, published between 1986 and 2005, were systematically reviewed for disease classification, surgical intervention, and treatment outcomes (neurologic status, pain scores, and ambulation).

Results

The surgical literature on the management of intradiscal disease continues to be limited to large series with short clinical follow-ups. Arthrodesis continues to be the primary treatment modality in the majority of patients. Newer treatment options including IDET, RFA, PELD, and cryoablation have shown promising results with regards to symptomatic relief and early return to function.

Conclusion

Low back pain is an extremely common and potentially debilitating problem. Adding biophysical methods to well-tested biomechanical and newly investigated biomolecular solutions allows for multiple avenues of therapeutic interventions. With future clinical and basic science studies regarding intradiscal therapies forthcoming, we may soon alter our current treatment algorithms for the management of discogenic back pain.

### A proposed diagnostic and treatment algorithm for the management of lumbar discogenic pain [^a0694f2c]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The usefulness and clinical adoption of this algorithm is predicated on a grasp of several key takeaway points and the flexibility to incorporate rapidly emerging new technologies into the continuum of care. Many patients with chronic lumbar discogenic pain are in their 30–50s underscoring the reality that their spine care will span many forthcoming decades. In summary, the starting point for the physical examination assessment is in the identification of patients with midline low back pain with no neurologic deficits that is increased with forward flexion and sitting who have a positive sustained hip flexion test that narrows the diagnostic aperture to anterior column involvement as the primary pain source. The identification of painful intervertebral discs is done via MRI and MRS which represents a potentially novel breakthrough in the precise and personalized diagnosis of lumbar discogenic pain. When these advancements in quantitative imaging are combined with effective first line intradiscal interventions, the potential exists to optimize spine care by restoring and preserving native disc structure and mechanics. There has been a renewed appreciation of the importance of the intervertebral disc as a catalyst in spine degeneration and this has hastened the development of new diagnostic and treatment technologies aimed at averting spinal surgery. A concerted and collaborative effort will be necessary from all stakeholders to amass the supporting compendium of data to fulfill regulatory and reimbursement requirements so that effective treatments can be made available to patients.

### A proposed diagnostic and treatment algorithm for the management of lumbar discogenic pain [^b6321095]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

The modified Delphi methodology we employed has several limitations including bias associated with participants altering their response to align with the majority view, limited open discussion, the dependence on the expertise of the responder to interpret the results, as well as the lack of guidelines and standards for selecting the expert panel members. We also note the distinction between clinical and mathematical algorithms in this context with the former utilized to guide clinical decision-making by providing a structured approach to diagnosis, treatment, and patient care and the latter used to perform calculations, analyze data, make predictions, and suggest treatments.

The operative treatment of spinal pathology in degenerative disc disease has traditionally been under the management purview of orthopedic spine surgeons and neurosurgeons. However, the recent commercial adoption of several minimally invasive treatment options has extended these intradiscal interventions to an expanded group of physician subspecialties. Interventional pain physicians play an integral role not only in the accurate diagnosis of lumbar discogenic pain but also in utilizing the burgeoning armamentarium of first line interventions to avert surgical intervention and restore and preserve the natural physiology, mechanics and structure of the intervertebral disc. Thus, we believe a team approach that integrates the knowledge base of imaging, pain management and orthopedic/neurosurgical specialists provides the most comprehensive method for managing patients with the full array of available intradiscal treatments and surgical options. This algorithm provides a straightforward clinical decision process for identifying, evaluating and treating patients with chronic lumbar discogenic pain.

First-Line Interventions

Several first-line interventions are now available to the interventional pain physician to treat lumbar discogenic pain. In this treatment algorithm, these therapeutic options should be reserved for patients exhibiting the previously specified cluster of clinical symptoms with low back pain severity of ≥ 4, MRI evidence of Pfirrmann grades 3 to 7, and with or without Modic type 1 and/or 2 changes (Figure 1, Box 5).

Without disrupting the normal anatomical structures of the vertebral motion segment, these minimally invasive therapies can be delivered intradiscally via cannula directly into the target degenerated disc(s) with the objective of supplementing, restoring and preserving native disc structure and function. In the US, these intradiscal therapies are classified as either exempt from regulatory oversight and demarcated as a tissue (section 361 of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act) or as a device, biologic or drug product (section 351 of the PHS Act). This latter group of interventions requires Food and Drug Administration (FDA) oversight and adherence to strict regulatory guidelines for market approval. There are several types of intradiscal therapies available commercially or in clinical development including autologous bone marrow concentrate (BMC), platelet rich plasma (PRP), nucleus pulposus (NP) allograft as well as autologous and allogeneic mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs).NP allograft is available for commercial use as a 361 tissue product whereas autologous BMC and PRP are exempt from regulatory oversight. Regulatory classification of MSC products is variable. To date, no 351 products have been approved by the FDA specifically indicated for use to treat lumbar discogenic pain (Figure 1, Box 4).

Mesenchymal Stromal Cells

The core evidence supporting the clinical efficacy of MSCs in the treatment of discogenic pain consists of a number of feasibility investigations as well as a pivotal trial. Specifically, Noriega et al, conducted a randomized sham controlled trial of allogeneic bone marrow derived MSCs in 24 patients with over 3 years of post procedure followup. Infiltration of the paraspinous musculature with an anesthetic agent served as the sham control. Significant differences in favor of MSC treatment were demonstrated between study groups in back pain and functional improvement throughout the followup period. Sham treated patients, in contrast, exhibited progressive degradation in all outcomes including structural disc degeneration with increasing Pfirrmann grades on MRI over baseline, whereas the MSC treated patients maintained the improved Pfirrmann grades achieved during the initial year after injection.

Aggregating the pain severity findings over all published MSC studies of discogenic pain based on the proportion of individuals achieving substantial clinical benefit (≥ 50% pain relief) at 6 months after intradiscal administration, the aggregate success rate was 54% (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 39%-68%). Society guidelines indicate Level III evidence for intradiscal MSC therapy.

Platelet Rich Plasma

Intradiscal autologous PRP injection has also shown benefit in patients with chronic lumbar discogenic pain. A meta-analysis of all published studies of PRP for disc degeneration estimated the aggregate 6-month success rate for substantial clinical benefit in back pain at 55% (95% CI: 40%-70%). Similar efficacy findings were confirmed in additional meta-analyses conducted by Peng et al and Muthu et al, Post procedure MRI studies failed to show structural improvements within the intervertebral disc associated with intradiscal PRP treatment. Society guidelines indicate Level III evidence for intradiscal injections of PRP.

Imperatives & Future Directions

Clinical Imperatives

Table 2 outlines the most salient clinical imperatives in the reporting of findings associated with intradiscal therapies for lumbar discogenic pain. These recommendations are based, in large part, on foundational research on injectable agents and minimally invasive surgeries used in the treatment of knee osteoarthritis pain.

Table 2
Clinical Imperatives in the Evaluation of Intradiscal Therapies

Standardized study endpoints should employ responder rates based on previously specified thresholds and include not only the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) but also, the patient acceptable symptomatic state (PASS), and the substantial clinical benefit (SCB). Although frequently absent from published reports of intradiscal therapies, threshold scores are patient-level metrics and must be reported as the percentage of patients who meet or exceed the threshold. A frequently encountered error is presenting whether the mean change score for the study group meets the threshold or not.

By expanding the presentation of patient-reported outcomes beyond traditional reporting, PASS provides the opportunity to address whether patients are satisfied with the intervention and whether they have derived a substantial benefit. Indeed, MCID represents only the smallest difference in an outcome that the patient perceives as beneficial. It has become increasingly important, particularly for subjective symptoms such as pain, activity limitations, and participation restrictions, that feeling well rather than feeling better is what matters most to the patient.

We recommend the inclusion of PASS in outcome reporting, which is a recent concept defined as the highest symptom level below which patients feel well. Only below this threshold is the improvement considered relevant.PASS can be presented as responder rates and used as a clinically applicable target for treatment efficacy by clinicians. Patients report a major improvement only when they perceive their health state as satisfactory, that is, when they achieve PASS.

BMAC Treatments for Discogenic Back Pain

BMAC as a treatment for discogenic back pain is not as widely studied as PRP, as shown in a recent review of BMAC to treat low back pain that listed only a few autologous BMAC-based studies, which were outnumbered by MSC cultured-cell studies. In a prospective, open-label clinical study, Pettine et aldemonstrated that intradiscal injection with BMAC resulted in a short-term decrease in VAS and improvement in ODI, with durable therapeutic benefit for both pain mitigation and improved disability out to the 3-year endpoint of the study. Six out of the 26 study participants enrolled had a resolution of their discogenic pain at the 3-year milestone. In a prospective, open-label clinical study of the intradiscal injection of either autologous PRP or BMAC, Navani et alselected the biologic treatment (PRP or BMAC) based on diagnostic findings related to severity of pathology: study participants with Pfirrmann index 1 and 2 levels received PRP, while Pfirrmann index 3 and 4 levels received BMAC, either of which was injected in no more than 3 discs per participant. The authors reported that out of 20 study participants, 15 remained at the study endpoint of 18 months, with 93% of study participants reporting a > 50% reduction in pain (assessed by the verbal pain score) and a > 50% improvement in function (SF-36). Finally, Navani et alrecently reported outcomes from a multi-center, prospective, RCT with PRP or BMAC injected into the painful disc(s) compared to a control group (saline trigger point injections). The study design allowed for a cross-over from the control treatment to either PRP or BMAC or from PRP/BMAC to BMAC/PRP if the participant had less than 50% improvement in NRS at the 3-month milestone. All participants in the control group crossed over to a biologic injection, while just one PRP-treated and one BMAC-treated participant crossed over to the other biologic. While there was not a meaningful difference in NRS and ODI between the PRP and BMAC cohorts at the 12-month milestone, both PRP and BMAC cohorts showed durable, statistically meaningful improvement in NRS and ODI at the 12-month milestone compared to baseline.

### A proposed diagnostic and treatment algorithm for the management of lumbar discogenic pain [^7f97aecc]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

It is important to draw the distinction between discogenic and vertebrogenic pain syndromes as they have different treatment algorithms. While there may be diagnostic overlap, we eschew the use of the term "discovertebral" that has entered the medical lexicon. Specific ICD-10-CM codes have been issued for discogenic (M51.360 – M51.379) and vertebrogenic (M54.51) pain underscoring the distinction between these pain generators. A necessary feature of vertebrogenic pain is the presence of Type 1 or Type 2 Modic changes on MRI. These are commonly seen with other findings such as inflammation, edema, vertebral endplate changes, disruption and fissuring of the endplate, and vascularized fibrous tissues within the adjacent marrow. Edematous signal (Type 1 Modic change), and changes to the vertebral body marrow including replacement of normal bone marrow by fat (Type 2 Modic change) can also be associated with discogenic pain but are not necessary features in the differential diagnosis. Direct disc stimulation with provocative or anesthetic discography or the use of MRS may aid in pinpointing whether the disc or the endplate is the definitive source of low back pain, but an unspecified proportion of patients may exhibit characteristics of both pain syndromes.

Additionally, it is important to emphasize that interventionalists performing intradiscal procedures should ensure rigorous aseptic technique and consider preprocedural screening for Cutibacterium acnes colonization, especially in patients with chronic lumbar discogenic pain and recurrent infections, to minimize infection risk and optimize outcomes.

The approach taken in developing the current discogenic pain algorithm was distinctly different than would be used in the formation of clinical practice guidelines, which are comprehensive dossiers and offer multiple options with graded levels of evidence. In contrast, we provide unambiguous alternatives and clear stopping points. As such, the proposed algorithm should be considered general guidance, appreciating that the treatment trajectory for some patients may fall outside this definitive rule set. In reality, each clinical decision should result in a personalized treatment plan based on discussions between physician and patient about the risk/benefit profile.

### A proposed diagnostic and treatment algorithm for the management of lumbar discogenic pain [^70851a6d]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

There is renewed interest in the intervertebral disc as a target for treatments aimed at ameliorating lumbar discogenic pain by restoring and preserving the natural structure and function of this component of the vertebral motion segment.

Methods

Using a modified Delphi methodology involving a panel of 11 experts, we developed a simple, understandable clinical algorithm to serve as a foundation for objective decision making regarding the diagnosis and treatment of lumbar discogenic pain throughout the entire continuum of care. A decision tree approach was utilized with "either/or" choices at each branch or node in the algorithm. Clinical activities in this algorithm were divided into examination procedures and corresponding treatment interventions. Corresponding treatment options were designated based on published degenerative disc disease (DDD)-specific clinical practice guidelines and/or meta-analyses.

Results

This algorithm recommends a systematic rule set for discogenic pain diagnostic and treatment options. Initially, the presence of lumbar discogenic pain is confirmed via assessment of a series of clinical signs including axial midline back pain (≥ 4 of 10), pain with flexion, sitting intolerance, positive pain provocation with sustained hip flexion, and absence of motor/sensory/reflex changes. Radiographic severity of DDD is graded by modified Pfirrmann grade (1 to 8). Treatment options are stratified by DDD severity to include conservative management (grades 1 and 2), minimally-invasive intradiscal therapies (grades 3 to 7), and more invasive surgical procedures (grade 8). Recognizing that the management program for patients with lumbar discogenic pain can be highly personalized, the treatment options recommended by this algorithm should be considered general guidance.

Conclusion

The proposed algorithm offers an easy-to-use clinical tool for identifying, evaluating and treating patients with lumbar discogenic pain. The successful implementation of this algorithm involves an important interplay between advanced practice providers, interventional pain physicians and spine surgeons.

Chronic low back pain — care gaps, epidural injection effectiveness, and surgical outcomes are quantified. A retrospective chart review of more than 75 million individuals reported that guideline nonadherence in newly diagnosed low back pain contributed to economic burden, with 38.7% of patients that underwent surgery not receiving conservative management and accounting for $265 million in healthcare expenses in the first 12 months after diagnosis. Systematic reviews and observational series showed epidural injections avoiding surgery with success rates ranging as high as 75% response rate. In surgically treated degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis, average numeric rating scale back pain improvement was 2.7 (SD 2.5) at one year with clinically significant improvement in 75% of patients, yet 25% continued to suffer even when minimal criteria used at 30% improvement rather than 50%. The text describes building on a stepwise strategy from physical and pharmacological therapy to interventional pain procedures before considering surgery, and notes that advancements such as chemonucleolysis, intradiscal therapies, and regenerative medicine can bridge the gap, while the limited number of RCTs warrants further study.

### Perspective on intradiscal therapies for lumbar discogenic pain: state of the science, knowledge gaps, and imperatives for clinical adoption [^a0dbde8f]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

SCB represents a stricter-criteria for success than MCID in an attempt to better capture patient satisfaction. For discogenic low back pain or referred leg pain, the validated MCID reflects a ≥ 30% improvement over baseline, the SCB is ≥ 40–50% improvement, and the PASS threshold is 30–40 mm (100 mm VAS scale) in chronic orthopedic conditions. Considering that MCID and SCB responder rate calculations are based on percentage improvements over baseline, we recommend that data capture for pain scores utilizes continuous values as obtained using a VAS instrument. We do not recommend using a numeric pain rating scale (NPRS) as the categorical data do not lend themselves to accurate responder rate estimates when using percentage-based thresholds.

Use of responder rates for primary endpoint analysis, as opposed to showing mean improvements, has been criticized as discarding important individual data regarding the variability in the magnitude of success (or failure). Consequently, we recommend that responder rates also be displayed graphically as a scatterplot of pre-treatment values (x-axis) versus degree of improvement (y-axis) for each outcome (Figure 1). As such, patient success status is computed based on the degree of improvement achieved at follow-up over baseline, and overall responder rate findings can be assessed as to their sensitivity to a fixed success threshold (ie, ≥ 20 mm VAS) or a variable percentage threshold (ie, ≥ 30%). Figure 1 illustrates an example of a scatter plot of individual back pain VAS change scores and their distribution around fixed and variable responder rate thresholds.

Data are presented in mm with the horizontal line (20 mm) and the diagonal line (30%) representing the absolute and percentage change thresholds, respectively, for clinical success.

Cellular Therapy

Several case series and prospective studies have investigated the use of intradiscal autologous stem cells for lumbar discogenic pain. Overall, there is moderate evidence, including that from two relatively small size RCTs, supporting intradiscal allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells in the treatment of discogenic LBP. Regarding human umbilical cord tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells, there is a single study of small sample size producing low evidence in its support.

In 2021, Beall et al published one-year results of the VAST RCT investigating the clinical relevance of treating painful intervertebral disc tissue by supplementary transplantation of viable cellular allograft disc matrix. This structural allograft is prepared from human nucleus pulposus allograft that contains allogeneic viable cells. A minimum of 6 × 10 6 cells were suspended in each allograft matrix suspension. This prospective, randomized, parallel-arm, multicenter study enrolled a total of 218 subjects who demonstrated clinical disc degeneration of 1 or 2 vertebral levels from L1 to S1 and Pfirrmann levels 3 through 6 on MRI. The cellular allograft group was compared to saline placebo or continued treatment with nonsurgical management in a 3.5:1:1 randomization. At 12 months with a total of 182 subjects completing the study, clinically meaningful improvements in mean visual analog scale of pain intensity (VASPI) and ODI scores were achieved in both the investigational allograft and saline groups. A responder analysis demonstrated a clinically meaningful reduction in ODI of ≥ 15 points at 12 months that was statistically significant in favor of the allograft group (76.5%) compared to the saline group (56.7%). The supplementation of the disc with viable allograft was able to produce a marked reduction in pain, an improvement of function, and a safety profile similar to traditional discography. Although the saline control placebo group also was able to demonstrate improvements, as previously suggested in prior studies, intradiscal saline may have some therapeutic advantage in itself and thus likely is an active comparator rather than a neutral placebo control.

Lumbar disc herniation and radiculopathy — about 95% of herniated discs occur at the lower lumbar spine (L4/5 and L5/S1 level); disc herniation above this level is more common in people aged over 55 years. The estimated prevalence of lumbar radiculopathy or sciatica has been described as 9.8 per 1,000 cases, 5.1 in men and 3.7 in women. Lumbar radiculopathy secondary to disc herniation resolves spontaneously in 23% to 48% of patients, but up to 30% to 70% will still have significant symptoms after one year, with 5% to 15% of patients undergoing surgery. Based on controlled evaluations, lumbar intervertebral discography has been shown to diagnose internal disc disruption in 39% of a younger cohort of patients with low back pain, and in a study without assessing internal disc disruption the reported prevalence rate of discogenic pain was 26%.

Safety and Complications

The overall safety profile of regenerative therapies is excellent and comparable to standard intradiscal procedures. Rare adverse events may include LBP, muscle spasms, and discitis. Standard intradiscal precautions should be taken with an emphasis on sterile technique in both the preparation of the injectate and the intradiscal procedure itself. To further illustrate this significance, a case of spondylodiscitis with positive Cutibacterium acnes culture has been reported subsequent to platelet-rich plasma (PRP) intradiscal injections. The authors stressed the importance of appropriate sterile technique and risk-stratification of patients with high infection potential, as well as better understanding of intradiscal biologic therapies and the intradiscal environment. Traditional antibiotic therapy protocols for intradiscal interventions may benefit from further review specifically regarding regenerative medicine.

Evidence Review with Evidence Level Designation: Intradiscal Regenerative Therapies

It is important to understand that not all biologics used in regenerative medicine are equivalent. For instance, factors at a minimum that can affect the final PRP product include volume of blood aspirated, baseline platelet count, patient health status and comorbidities, patient medications, anticoagulant of choice, centrifugation parameters, and inclusion/exclusion of leukocytes. Similarly, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are found in most tissues of the human body but primarily sourced for reimplantation from the bone marrow and adipose due to ease of access. Volume of aspirate, patient health status and comorbidities, patient medications, harvesting protocol parameters and technique can all affect the final MSC product. Not distinguishing this heterogeneity, we have summarized the gross clinical evidence evaluating regenerative medicine for LBP from discogenic pathology, including prolotherapy, protein-rich plasma (PRP), cellular therapy, and other intradiscal injectates (Table 9).

The management of discogenic low back pain is controversial: its accurate diagnosis is difficult, and treatment is inconsistent. Before wide application, the advantages and disadvantages of each procedure must be considered in lieu of inadequate study design and the lack of sufficient long-term outcome studies.

Discussion

Using a modified Delphi methodology, we engaged a panel of experts in musculoskeletal imaging, interventional pain management, and spine surgery to develop a pragmatic discogenic pain clinical algorithm that provides a foundation for making procedural decisions related to the management of patients with lumbar discogenic pain. The advantage of this Delphi-based approach is the ability to develop consensus around this topic by involving experts with substantial experience in treating such patients and with significant contributions to the existing literature on this issue.

We recognize that many decisions regarding the diagnosis and treatment of patients with disc degeneration require personalized treatment plans that cannot be addressed via binary choices in an algorithm. Indeed, many patients with chronic low back pain have multiple contributory spinal conditions that can act as pain generators. That said, the current algorithm specifically focuses on identifying those patients where the primary complaint is axial midline back pain without radicular symptoms, a symptom set highly specific to disc associated pain.

Introduction

Significant advancements in the pathoanatomical characterization of the degenerative processes of the intervertebral disc have been instrumental in establishing and refining clinical diagnostic criteria specific to patients with lumbar discogenic pain. Although diagnosis can be difficult, salient features of physical examination have been defined to include axial midline low back pain, sitting intolerance, pain with flexion, positive provocation with sustained hip flexion, absence of motor/sensor/reflex change, and positive discography with or without non-radicular/non-sciatic referred leg pain in a sclerotomal distribution.

In a recently published quantitative evaluation of the global burden of disease, the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) reported that out of 395 diseases, injuries, and impairments, low back pain was the leading cause of years lived with disability (YLD), responsible for approximately 64 million YLDs or 7.4% of total global YLDs in 2019. Estimates suggest that as many as 40% of patients exhibiting persistently severe low back pain have diagnostic signs and symptoms of discogenic origin including imaging evidence of internal disc disruption and other findings associated with annular tearing.

If discogenic low back pain becomes chronic and refractory to conservative medical management, there are few therapeutic options short of surgical discectomy often coupled with total disc arthroplasty or instrumented interbody spine fusion. These options, such as utilizing cell-based and biomaterial engineering therapies to modify the physiology and possibly restore the structure of the degenerated intervertebral disc, may serve to fill the extensive treatment gap between conservative management and traditional spine surgery. Therapeutic candidates including mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), platelet-rich plasma (PRP), nucleus pulposus (NP) tissue, and related cell-based agents have been proposed and can be delivered minimally-invasively under fluoroscopic guidance via a needle-based approach. Both autologous products and their allogeneic analogs have been studied for relief of discogenic pain. The underlying mechanism of action can involve the differentiation of chondrogenic precursor cells into viable regenerated disc tissue as with the injection of MSCs or the direct implantation of native disc material as with allogeneic NP. Products have ranged from autologous bone marrow aspirate containing a cocktail of pluripotent cell types to various derivatives including commercial formulations with proprietary manufacturing methods.

Provocation discography — prevalence, accuracy, and clinical utility: Evidence for the prevalence of discogenic pain was available only with provocation discography utilizing IASP criteria in 3 high-quality studies, with internal disc disruption estimated at 39% in a younger cohort following injury and 42% in a heterogeneous low back pain population, and a third study reporting 26% when internal disc disruption was not assessed. The evidence for provocation discography is fair based on 3 well-performed accuracy studies, and there is limited evidence supporting functional anesthetic discography or provocation discography with local anesthetic injection. Correlation with other diagnostic tests was moderate to strong in 13 out of 33 evaluations, yielding limited to fair accuracy. Across 22 fusion/displacement surgery studies diagnosed via preoperative discography, only 4 reported good results, and based on this paucity, the evidence is limited supporting the use of discography prior to surgical procedures. There is fair evidence supporting the management of discogenic pain with epidural injections, and the evidence is fair supporting IDET and biacuplasty.

PRP Treatments for Discogenic Back Pain

A systematic reviewassessed the clinical evidence on the use of PRP to treat discogenic back pain and/or other pain generators in low back pain, which included the clinical studies listed in two other recent systematic reviews. Machado et alreviewed RCTs and prospective, single-arm trials in which PRP was injected into discs, intraspinal compartments (epidural and transforaminal), facets and muscles (either directed at a single target or multiple, simultaneously treated targets). A total of 914 study participants were treated in the 13 RCTs with an intradiscal injection and 1759 study participants were treated in the 27 prospective, single-arm trials, with approximately 29% receiving multi-target simultaneous injections. The RCTs compared the PRP treatment to a variety of control or placebo treatments, including corticosteroids, contrast agent, saline/kefazol, saline, lidocaine, HA, or contrast agent, as well as two-active treatment arms (ozone, Platelet Rich Fibrin [PRF]). Machado et alconcluded that almost all studies showed positive results for the PRP treatments evaluated, with relatively few adverse events reported over the duration of the studies, which ranged from eight weeks out to two years. Their review showed that 11 RCTs demonstrated positive therapeutic benefit of the PRP treatment for both pain mitigation and improved disability, in contrast to the degree and durability of control treatments.

There are several publications that illustrate important considerations when using PRP as a therapy. In one study, PRP preparations with higher platelet concentrations used in treating discogenic back pain showed a positive correlation for improvement in pain (numerical rating scale [NRS] at 6-month milestone: Pearson coefficient [r] = 0.73) and disability (ODI at 6-month milestone: Pearson coefficient [r] = 0.7); both of which were assessed as statistically significant. PRP injectates, characterized as LR-PRP, with a 10-fold increase in platelet concentration were reported to be more therapeutically beneficial compared to PRP that had a platelet concentration increase of 5-fold or less. In contrast, Schepers et alused a lower volume of whole blood (32 mL) compared to the volume (60 mL) processed in Lutz et aland used a processing technology that resulted in a leukocyte-depleted PRP (LP-PRP), both of which might have accounted for a finding of non-superiority of the PRP treatments over the control arm.

### An update of comprehensive evidence-based guidelines for interventional techniques in chronic spinal pain. part II: guidance and recommendations [^3c358db6]. Pain Physician (2013). Medium credibility.

Intradiscal electrothermal therapy (IDET), discTRODE, and biacuplasty — evidence, complications, and recommendations are summarized as follows: the evidence supporting the efficacy of IDET is limited to fair, discTRODE had only one study showing no benefit with the evidence limited (or poor), and biacuplasty has limited to fair evidence based on one randomized trial with modest results. While some serious complications of TAPs have been reported, they are rare and temporary, with described events including discitis, osteonecrosis, and development of Grade 1 anterolisthesis and cauda equina syndrome. In a review of 1,675 IDET procedures and 35,000 medical device reports from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), there were 6 nerve root injuries (5 related to the placement of the introducer needle) that resolved spontaneously; six cases of disc herniation were reported, 2 of which required discectomy; and nineteen cases of catheter breakage were reported. There are no published cases of complications from discTRODE and there are no reported complications from biacuplasty. Based on the evidence synthesis, there is limited to fair evidence for IDET and biacuplasty and limited evidence for discTRODE; consequently, IDET and biacuplasty may be performed in a select group of patients with discogenic pain nonresponsive to conservative modalities including epidural injections.

### Consensus practice guidelines on interventions for lumbar facet joint pain from a multispecialty, international working group [^79675868]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

It is important to recognize that what may be best for an individual person and justifiable in a clinical trial may not be in the best interest of society, or even for an individual practitioner. For example, interventions that are incredibly costly and time-consuming, but provide only a marginal increase in efficacy may be not be cost-effective on a macrolevel. However, the conduct of early phase clinical trials does not usually reflect clinical practice. Inclusion and exclusion criteria tend to be longer and more rigorous in clinical trials, and the additional costs incurred by being more selective in enrollment and meticulous in performance often pale in comparison to the overall cost of product or drug development.

Patient selection

Similar to all treatments, patient selection for diagnostic facet blocks plays a critical role in determining the likelihood of a positive outcome. There is consensus that failure of at least 3 months of conservative therapy is a reasonable threshold that should be implemented in both clinical trials and practice, although practice guidelines could allow flexibility in cases of extenuating circumstances. The cut-off for clinical trials is similar to what was advocated by an international panel of experts for epidural steroid injection studies, and is predicated on the observation that the natural prognosis is favorable for back pain in individuals with acute pain, even without treatment. There is scant evidence supporting specific physical examination signs or imaging to diagnose facetogenic pain or predict treatment outcomes, so selection should be adapted according to the specific question being addressed.

Patient selection in clinical trials designed to determine efficacy must employ stringent selection criteria to eliminate likely non-responders (eg, individuals with depression, those on high doses of opioids), ensure that participants have the index condition being studied (ie, reduce false-positive rates for MBB), and maximize the chances for technical success even when doing so may not be cost-effective (ie, performing sensory stimulation, creating multiple lesions, utilizing relatively expensive systems that enhance lesion size). However, practitioners on the frontlines treating pain often have different goals. For example, although patients who are depressed and sleep poorly, or are on temporary disability or opioids because of back pain, may not be candidates for a clinical trial aimed at determining efficacy, the upside of treatment in these patients is substantial.

Secondary Interventions

We recommend additional multidisciplinary team consultation for patients who fail to realize a clinically significant improvement and/or exhibit worsening or new onset symptoms following first line intradiscal therapy. For patients with Modic type 1 and/or 2 changes evident on MRI, basivertebral nerve ablation (BVNA) should be considered for L3 to S1 involvement (Figure 1, Box 9). For patients without Modic changes, surgical consultation should be considered (Figure 1, Box 7). Surgical options for chronic lumbar discogenic pain consist of discectomy with instrumented interbody fusion or disc arthroplasty. Both approaches remove the painful disc and either stabilize the motion segment, as in the case of fusion, or preserve motion, as in the case of disc arthroplasty. While there is ongoing debate regarding choice of surgical treatment for symptomatic disc degeneration, several meta-analyses have concluded that lumbar fusion provides improvement in back function that is no better than that achieved with nonoperative care alone. The reimbursement barriers to lumbar disc arthroplasty notwithstanding, our panel concluded that it remains preferable to preserve natural motion across the joint if at all possible.

Similar clinical success criteria as noted previously should be employed to evaluate the effectiveness of secondary interventions for disc degeneration and discogenic back pain with the caveat that assessment of clinical success should be undertaken within 6 months of BVNA (Figure 1, Box 10) and within 12 months for surgical interventions (Figure 1, Box 11). For all interventions deemed a treatment success, periodic symptom assessment should be undertaken at least annually (Figure 1, Box 12). For patients who fail to experience clinical success post surgery (ie, failed back surgery syndrome), additional interventions may be considered such as revision surgery, spinal cord stimulation and/or facet denervation (Figure 1, Box 13).

Percutaneous lumbar laser disc decompression (PLDD) — candidate selection and exclusions — are grounded in a closed hydraulic disc model in which only contained herniations are expected to retract with pressure reduction; accordingly, a frank disc extrusion or sequestered herniation is an exclusion criterion, and patients with critically (< 50%) diminished disc height, significant central stenosis, serious neurologic symptoms such as cauda equina syndrome, or other conditions requiring acute surgical intervention are not generally considered candidates for PLDD.

### The analgesic efficacy of intradiscal injection of bone marrow aspirate concentrate and culture-expanded bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells in discogenic pain: a systematic review [^6bf81e8f]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This study overall supported modest efficacy in treating discogenic pain and improving functional outcomes with BMAC or MSC injections, however, the level of certainty for the potential associations made in this review is low as documented by very low-quality GRADE evidence to support these conclusions. Generally, improvements in pain and functional scores compared to baseline were found in most studies using either BMAC or BM-MSCs and there were some mild objective improvements noted on spinal MRIs in some studies. Major limitations included significant heterogeneity among participants, limiting generalizability such as areas of pain and variability in types and quantities of treatments, small sample sizes with small or no control groups, high risk of bias, inconsistency in determining painful discs, lack of blinding, and industry funded studies.

Consensus Point 26. The current evidence suggests that intra-discal BMAC injection may provide long-term alleviation of pain and improvement in physical function for patients with discogenic pain, although these differences may be similar to those with intra-discal injection with PRP (Level I, Grade C).
