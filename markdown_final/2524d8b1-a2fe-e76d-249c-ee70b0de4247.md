## Question

What if they have no signs of coronary artery disease or heart failure? Would that be contraindicated for a beta blocker?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether beta-blockers are contraindicated in someone who has no evidence of coronary artery disease and no heart failure, and under what circumstances they might still be appropriate. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core indications for beta-blockers across cardiovascular conditions. Then, I should verify what contemporary guidelines say about use in the absence of CAD or HF. Next, I will examine the evidence base for secondary prevention after myocardial infarction and how that applies to patients without CAD. After that, I need to check for other valid indications like angina, arrhythmias, hypertension, and perioperative contexts. Finally, I should review absolute and relative contraindications and synthesize a practical recommendation with monitoring considerations.

> Let me first confirm the core indications so I don't jump to conclusions: beta-blockers are foundational in HFrEF, after myocardial infarction (especially with reduced LVEF), for angina control, for certain arrhythmias, and as part of hypertension management in selected patients, with benefits also in perioperative risk reduction in high-risk noncardiac surgery and in cardiac surgery for AF prevention, so absence of CAD or HF alone does not define a contraindication [^115Emj6D] [^117N2fom] [^115RUUQ3] [^115Tb3Ct] [^114rV6fm] [^111boU6g].

> Wait, let me verify the specific question about chronic coronary disease without MI or LV dysfunction. The 2023 AHA/ACC chronic coronary disease guideline explicitly recommends against using beta-blockers solely to reduce major adverse cardiovascular events in patients with chronic coronary disease who have no prior MI and no LVEF 50% or less, which means in stable CAD without these features, beta-blockers are not indicated for event reduction, though they may still be used for angina or other symptom control [^117N2fom] [^113unGuf].

> Hold on, I should verify the post-MI evidence because it often gets conflated with CAD broadly. A recent randomized trial in patients with MI and preserved LVEF showed that beta-blockers reduced a composite of death or major adverse cardiovascular events compared with no beta-blocker, supporting secondary prevention after MI even when LV function is normal, but this does not translate to primary prevention in people without CAD or MI history [^1125XUnk] [^112Vp7kt].

> I need to check other valid indications beyond CAD and HF. For symptomatic angina, beta-blockers are first-line to control heart rate and symptoms, and for hypertension in the setting of CAD or when other classes are not tolerated, beta-blockers are reasonable, so absence of CAD or HF does not preclude use when these indications exist [^115RUUQ3] [^115Tb3Ct] [^114Bgg2n].

> Next, I should review absolute and relative contraindications so I don't overgeneralize. Absolute contraindications include severe bradycardia, second- or third-degree AV block without a pacemaker, cardiogenic shock, and overt decompensated heart failure, while relative cautions include reactive airway disease (where cardioselective agents may still be used carefully), peripheral vascular disease with rest ischemia, and diabetes with frequent hypoglycemia, so "no CAD/no HF" is not itself a contraindication [^113xUjHg] [^11194Emn] [^111uhSuo] [^1163Pb7L].

> Let me consider special scenarios that can confuse the issue. In perioperative care, continuation of chronic beta-blockade is advised, and initiation may be considered in high-risk patients undergoing vascular or intermediate-risk surgery, but routine initiation on the day of surgery is discouraged; in cardiac surgery, beta-blockers reduce postoperative atrial fibrillation, again reflecting indication-specific benefit rather than a blanket rule tied to CAD or HF status [^111SQ4Ln] [^114rV6fm] [^111boU6g].

> I should double-check the bottom line so I don't miss anything. No, absence of CAD and absence of HF are not contraindications to beta-blockers; they simply mean there is no guideline-supported indication for disease-modifying or event-reduction purposes, though beta-blockers remain appropriate for angina, certain arrhythmias, selected hypertension presentations, and perioperative risk management when indicated, with therapy individualized and contraindications screened each time [^117N2fom] [^115RUUQ3] [^115Tb3Ct] [^114rV6fm].

> But wait, what if the patient is on a beta-blocker already for a prior indication that no longer clearly applies, like a remote MI with preserved LVEF or resolved angina? I should confirm that guidelines advise reassessing long-term beta-blocker use in chronic coronary disease without ongoing indications, and if there is no current reason such as angina, arrhythmia, or hypertension, a cautious taper can be considered with close monitoring for withdrawal symptoms or recurrent ischemia [^117ATT8R] [^11194Emn].

---

Beta-blockers are **not contraindicated** in patients without coronary artery disease (CAD) or heart failure (HF). They are appropriate for **compelling indications** such as hypertension with angina, arrhythmias, migraine, or anxiety, and are **first-line after myocardial infarction** even with preserved ejection fraction [^1125XUnk]. However, in patients without CAD or HF, routine use for primary prevention is not recommended [^1174fzbZ]. Use should be individualized, with attention to contraindications such as severe bradycardia, heart block, or reactive airway disease [^113xUjHg] [^11194Emn].

---

## Indications for beta-blockers in patients without CAD or HF

Beta-blockers are **not limited to CAD or HF**; they have established roles in other conditions:

- **Hypertension**: Particularly with coexisting angina, arrhythmias, or migraine [^115Tb3Ct] [^114Bgg2n].
- **Arrhythmias**: Atrial fibrillation/flutter, supraventricular tachycardias, and ventricular arrhythmias [^notfound].
- **Migraine prophylaxis**: Effective in reducing frequency and severity.
- **Anxiety**: Useful for somatic symptoms (e.g. tremor, palpitations).
- **Post-myocardial infarction**: Beneficial even with preserved ejection fraction [^1125XUnk].

---

## Evidence supporting beta-blocker use in patients without CAD or HF

Recent evidence supports beta-blockers in specific scenarios without CAD or HF:

- **Post-myocardial infarction**: The BETAMI-DANBLOCK trial showed reduced death or major adverse cardiovascular events in patients with preserved LVEF (≥ 40%) [^1125XUnk].
- **Hypertension with angina**: ESC 2024 guidelines recommend beta-blockers for symptomatic angina requiring BP control [^115Tb3Ct].
- **Arrhythmias**: ACC/AHA/HRS guidelines endorse beta-blockers for atrial fibrillation and ventricular arrhythmias [^notfound].

---

## Contraindications and precautions

While beta-blockers are not contraindicated solely by the absence of CAD or HF, **clinicians must consider**:

| **Absolute contraindications** | **Relative contraindications (use with caution)** |
|-|-|
| Severe bradycardia (heart rate < 50 bpm) | Peripheral vascular disease |
| Second- or third-degree AV block without a pacemaker | Diabetes mellitus (risk of masking hypoglycemia) |
| Cardiogenic shock | Depression |
| Overt heart failure | Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) |
| Severe asthma or reactive airway disease | Pregnancy (some agents) |

---

## Risks and benefits in patients without CAD or HF

Benefits include symptom control for angina, arrhythmias, migraine, and anxiety, and mortality reduction post-MI even with preserved LVEF [^1125XUnk]. Risks include bradycardia, fatigue, sexual dysfunction, masking of hypoglycemia, and potential worsening of asthma/COPD; these are **generally manageable with careful selection and titration**.

---

## Current clinical guidelines

- **ESC 2024**: Recommends beta-blockers for symptomatic angina requiring BP control [^115Tb3Ct].
- **ACC/AHA 2023**: Recommends beta-blockers post-MI even with preserved LVEF [^1125XUnk].
- **VA/DoD 2020**: Does not recommend beta-blockers as first-line for hypertension but allows them with compelling indications (e.g. angina, arrhythmias) [^1174fzbZ].

---

## Clinical scenarios where beta-blockers may be beneficial

- **Hypertension with angina**: First-line therapy [^115Tb3Ct].
- **Atrial fibrillation**: Rate control and symptom relief [^notfound].
- **Migraine prophylaxis**: Effective in reducing frequency and severity.
- **Anxiety**: Useful for somatic symptoms.
- **Post-MI**: Reduced events even with preserved LVEF [^1125XUnk].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Beta-blockers are **not contraindicated** in patients without CAD or HF. They remain valuable for specific indications such as hypertension with angina, arrhythmias, migraine, anxiety, and post-MI care. Use should be individualized, balancing benefits and risks, and guided by comorbidities and patient preferences.

In a large, new, observational study, β-blocker treatment did not improve clinical outcomes in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), including those with previous myocardial infarction, and was associated with more events in individuals with risk factors only.

As new treatments continue to improve clinical outcomes in coronary artery disease (CAD) and heart failure, it is necessary to characterize the appropriate use of β-adrenergic receptor blockers (β-blockers) in the contemporary management of these conditions. This review examines the current evidence supporting β-blocker use in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), heart failure with midrange ejection fraction (HFmEF), and heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), following acute coronary syndrome and in stable CAD. β-Blockers remain essential in the treatment of HFrEF, but limited evidence supports their use in HFmEF or HFpEF. They should still be considered routinely following acute coronary syndrome, but there is a need for contemporary trials that re-examine this in patients without left ventricular dysfunction, as well as in patients with stable CAD. From a global perspective, more studies are needed to characterize the extent of β-blocker use in CAD and heart failure, and how evidence-based use can be improved in these conditions.

Limitations

There are several limitations to this analysis. Analyses were not formally prespecified before data collection and the methods of analysis were not prospectively defined. Patients with severe heart failure or life-threatening arrhythmias as a complication to recent MI and in whom the benefit of β-blockers is clear were excluded. Outcomes were not adjudicated. However, the results were consistent for non-adjudicated outcomes and for all-cause mortality. Observational studies have inherent limitations: residual confounding from measured or unmeasured variables cannot be excluded (related to both contraindication and indication bias) and could contribute to the observed differences in mortality between groups. In addition, enrolment and follow-up did not start at the time of treatment initiation or at the time of diagnosis, which can cause bias. A third of patients without β-blocker at baseline were nor treated because of prior symptoms of intolerance or contraindication, which may reflect imbalance in baseline risk between groups related in particular to comorbidities such as asthma or COPD. It is noteworthy, however, that the REACH score at baseline was nearly identical between β-blocker users and non-users.

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Patients with chronic reduction of LVEF but no symptoms — pharmacologic prevention: Long-term treatment with an ACEI has been shown to delay the onset of HF symptoms and decrease the risk of death and hospitalization for HF in asymptomatic patients with reduced LVEF, whether due to a remote ischemic injury or to a nonischemic cardiomyopathy. Although there are no studies that specifically addressed use of ARBs in asymptomatic patients with reduced LVEF, ARBs may be an appropriate alternative, particularly in patients who cannot tolerate an ACEI. Furthermore, although controlled clinical trials are lacking, the use of beta-blockers in patients with a low EF and no symptoms (especially those with coronary artery disease) is also recommended, and the same beta-blockers should be used that were employed in the large HF trials.

### Beta-blockers in patients without heart failure after myocardial infarction [^112Vp7kt]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Cardiovascular disease is the number one cause of death globally. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 7.4 million people died from ischaemic heart disease in 2012, constituting 15% of all deaths. Beta-blockers are recommended and are often used in patients with heart failure after acute myocardial infarction. However, it is currently unclear whether beta-blockers should be used in patients without heart failure after acute myocardial infarction. Previous meta-analyses on the topic have shown conflicting results. No previous systematic review using Cochrane methods has assessed the effects of beta-blockers in patients without heart failure after acute myocardial infarction.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of beta-blockers compared with placebo or no treatment in patients without heart failure and with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) greater than 40% in the non-acute phase after myocardial infarction.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, Science Citation Index - Expanded, BIOSIS Citation Index, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, ClinicalTrials.gov, European Medicines Agency, Food and Drug Administration, Turning Research Into Practice, Google Scholar, and SciSearch from their inception to February 2021.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised clinical trials assessing effects of beta-blockers versus control (placebo or no treatment) in patients without heart failure after myocardial infarction, irrespective of publication type and status, date, and language. We excluded trials randomising participants with diagnosed heart failure at the time of randomisation.

Data Collection and Analysis

We followed our published protocol, with a few changes made, and methodological recommendations provided by Cochrane and Jakobsen and colleagues. Two review authors independently extracted data. Our primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, serious adverse events, and major cardiovascular events (composite of cardiovascular mortality and non-fatal myocardial reinfarction). Our secondary outcomes were quality of life, angina, cardiovascular mortality, and myocardial infarction during follow-up. We assessed all outcomes at maximum follow-up. We systematically assessed risks of bias using seven bias domains and we assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included 25 trials randomising a total of 22,423 participants (mean age 56.9 years). All trials and outcomes were at high risk of bias. In all, 24 of 25 trials included a mixed group of participants with ST-elevation myocardial infarction and non-ST myocardial infarction, and no trials provided separate results for each type of infarction. One trial included participants with only ST-elevation myocardial infarction. All trials except one included participants younger than 75 years of age. Methods used to exclude heart failure were various and were likely insufficient. A total of 21 trials used placebo, and four trials used no intervention, as the comparator. All patients received usual care; 24 of 25 trials were from the pre-reperfusion era (published from 1974 to 1999), and only one trial was from the reperfusion era (published in 2018). The certainty of evidence was moderate to low for all outcomes. Our meta-analyses show that beta-blockers compared with placebo or no intervention probably reduce the risks of all-cause mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.81, 97.5% confidence interval (CI) 0.73 to 0.90; I² = 15%; 22,085 participants, 21 trials; moderate-certainty evidence) and myocardial reinfarction (RR 0.76, 98% CI 0.69 to 0.88; I² = 0%; 19,606 participants, 19 trials; moderate-certainty evidence). Our meta-analyses show that beta-blockers compared with placebo or no intervention may reduce the risks of major cardiovascular events (RR 0.72, 97.5% CI 0.69 to 0.84; 14,994 participants, 15 trials; low-certainty evidence) and cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.73, 98% CI 0.68 to 0.85; I² = 47%; 21,763 participants, 19 trials; low-certainty evidence). Hence, evidence seems to suggest that beta-blockers versus placebo or no treatment may result in a minimum reduction of 10% in RR for risks of all-cause mortality, major cardiovascular events, cardiovascular mortality, and myocardial infarction. However, beta-blockers compared with placebo or no intervention may not affect the risk of angina (RR 1.04, 98% CI 0.93 to 1.13; I² = 0%; 7115 participants, 5 trials; low-certainty evidence). No trials provided data on serious adverse events according to good clinical practice from the International Committee for Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH-GCP), nor on quality of life.

Authors' Conclusions

Beta-blockers probably reduce the risks of all-cause mortality and myocardial reinfarction in patients younger than 75 years of age without heart failure following acute myocardial infarction. Beta-blockers may further reduce the risks of major cardiovascular events and cardiovascular mortality compared with placebo or no intervention in patients younger than 75 years of age without heart failure following acute myocardial infarction. These effects could, however, be driven by patients with unrecognised heart failure. The effects of beta-blockers on serious adverse events, angina, and quality of life are unclear due to sparse data or no data at all. All trials and outcomes were at high risk of bias, and incomplete outcome data bias alone could account for the effect seen when major cardiovascular events, angina, and myocardial infarction are assessed. The evidence in this review is of moderate to low certainty, and the true result may depart substantially from the results presented here. Future trials should particularly focus on patients 75 years of age and older, and on assessment of serious adverse events according to ICH-GCP and quality of life. Newer randomised clinical trials at low risk of bias and at low risk of random errors are needed if the benefits and harms of beta-blockers in contemporary patients without heart failure following acute myocardial infarction are to be assessed properly. Such trials ought to be designed according to the SPIRIT statement and reported according to the CONSORT statement.

ACC/AHA 2005 heart failure (HF) — concomitant disorders: Physicians should control systolic and diastolic hypertension and diabetes mellitus in patients with HF in accordance with recommended guidelines (Level of Evidence: C). Physicians should use nitrates and beta-blockers for the treatment of angina in patients with HF (Level of Evidence: B). Physicians should recommend coronary revascularization according to recommended guidelines in patients who have both HF and angina (Level of Evidence: A). Physicians should prescribe anticoagulants in patients with HF who have paroxysmal or persistent atrial fibrillation or a previous thromboembolic event (Level of Evidence: A). Physicians should control the ventricular response rate in patients with HF and atrial fibrillation with a beta-blocker (or amiodarone, if the beta-blocker is contraindicated or not tolerated) (Level of Evidence: A). Patients with coronary artery disease and HF should be treated in accordance with recommended guidelines for chronic stable angina (Level of Evidence: C). Physicians should prescribe antiplatelet agents for prevention of MI and death in patients with HF who have underlying coronary artery disease (Level of Evidence: B).

### 2025 ACC / AHA / ACEP / NAEMSP / SCAI guideline for the management of patients with acute coronary syndromes: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^112TzJJ1]. Circulation (2025). High credibility.

Beta-blocker therapy in acute coronary syndromes — In patients with ACS without contraindications, early (< 24 hours) initiation of oral beta-blocker therapy is recommended to reduce risk of reinfarction and ventricular arrhythmias. A low dose of oral beta blocker should be initiated in patients without contraindication early after diagnosis of ACS (< 24 hours) with slow dose escalation as blood pressure and heart rate permit, and use should be discontinued in those with new or worsening HF symptoms or signs of cardiogenic shock. In hemodynamically stable patients with STEMI who do not have acute HF, intravenous beta blockers can be administered prior to reperfusion if there are ongoing symptoms or a clinical indication for administration, but the weight of the evidence does not support the routine use of intravenous beta blockers prior to PPCI because of inconsistent results as to whether it has any favorable effect on infarct size or clinical outcomes. Patients with an initial contraindication to beta-blocker therapy on presentation can be reassessed after 24 hours and initiated on oral beta-blocker therapy if the initial contraindication has resolved, and the optimal duration of beta-blocker use remains unclear in patients with preserved LVEF.

### Effect of β-blocker therapy on mortality rates and future myocardial infarction rates in patients with coronary artery disease but no history of myocardial infarction or congestive heart failure [^113nMyuM]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

Beta-blocker therapy has been shown to benefit patients who have coronary artery disease and present with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and/or congestive heart failure (HF). However, whether beta-blocker therapy provides a similar benefit in patients who have coronary artery disease but not AMI or HF is unknown. A population of 4,304 patients who did not have HF but did have angiographically confirmed coronary artery disease (≥ 1 stenosis of ≥ 70%) without AMI at hospital presentation was evaluated. Baseline demographics, cardiac risk factors, clinical presentation, therapeutic procedures, and discharge medications were recorded. Patients were followed for a mean of 3.0 ± 1.9 years (range 1 month to 6.9 years) for outcomes of all-cause death or AMI. Patients' average age was 65 ± 11 years and 77% were men. Overall, 10% died and 5% had a nonfatal AMI. Discharge beta-blocker prescription was associated with an increased event-free AMI survival rate for all-cause death (no beta blocker 88.3%, beta blocker 94.5%, p < 0.001) and death/AMI (no beta blocker 83.4%, beta blocker 89.2%, p < 0.001) but not non-fatal AMI (no beta blocker 93.6%, beta blocker 94.1%, p = 0.60). After adjustment for 16 covariates, including statin prescription, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor prescription, and type of baseline therapy, the effect of beta blockers on the combination end point of death/AMI was eliminated. However, the effect of beta blockers on death remained (hazard ratio 0.66, 95% confidence interval 0.47 to 0.93, p = 0.02). Thus, beta blockers are clearly indicated for most patients who have HF or AMI, and our results suggest that patients who have coronary artery disease without these conditions have approximately the same protective benefit against death. No effect was observed on longitudinal incidence of AMI or the combination of death/nonfatal MI.

### 2025 ACC / AHA / ACEP / NAEMSP / SCAI guideline for the management of patients with acute coronary syndromes: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^112oCre1]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Acute coronary syndromes — beta-blocker therapy: In patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) without contraindications, early (< 24 hours) initiation of oral beta-blocker therapy is recommended to reduce risk of reinfarction and ventricular arrhythmias, and a low dose should be started early after diagnosis of ACS (< 24 hours) with slow dose escalation as blood pressure and heart rate permit; examples of contraindications include acute heart failure (HF) [Killip class II–IV], low cardiac output or risk for cardiogenic shock, PR interval > 0.24 milliseconds, second- or third-degree heart block without a pacemaker, severe bradycardia, and active bronchospasm. Use should be discontinued in those with new or worsening HF symptoms or signs of cardiogenic shock. In hemodynamically stable patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) who do not have acute HF, intravenous beta blockers can be administered prior to reperfusion if there are ongoing symptoms or a clinical indication, but routine use prior to PPCI is not supported because of inconsistent results regarding infarct size or clinical outcomes. Patients with an initial contraindication can be reassessed after 24 hours for initiation if the contraindication has resolved, although the optimal duration of beta-blocker use remains unclear in patients with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), and a randomized trial did not confirm long-term benefit after hospital discharge in lower risk patients with preserved LV function who had undergone coronary revascularization.

### Cardioselective β-blockers for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^111uhSuo]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Beta-blocker therapy has a proven mortality benefit in patients with hypertension, heart failure and coronary artery disease, as well as during the perioperative period. These drugs have traditionally been considered contraindicated in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

Objectives

To assess the effect of cardioselective beta-blockers on respiratory function of patients with COPD.

Search Strategy

A comprehensive search of the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register (derived from systematic searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL) was carried out to identify randomised blinded controlled trials from 1966 to May 2005. We did not exclude trials on the basis of language.

Selection Criteria

Randomised, blinded, controlled trials of single dose or longer duration that studied the effects of cardioselective beta-blockers on the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) or symptoms in patients with COPD.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two independent reviewers extracted data from the selected articles, reconciling differences by consensus. Two interventions studied were the administration of beta-blocker, given either as a single dose or for longer duration, and the use of beta2-agonist given after the study drug.

Main Results

Eleven studies of single-dose treatment and 9 of treatment for longer durations, ranging from 2 days to 12 weeks, met selection criteria. Cardioselective beta-blockers, given as a single dose or for longer duration, produced no change in FEV1 or respiratory symptoms compared to placebo, and did not affect the FEV1 treatment response to beta2-agonists. A subgroup analysis revealed no change in results for those participants with severe chronic airways obstruction or for those with a reversible obstructive component.

Authors' Conclusions

Cardioselective beta-blockers, given to patients with COPD in the identified studies did not produce adverse respiratory effects. Given their demonstrated benefit in conditions such as heart failure, coronary artery disease and hypertension, cardioselective beta-blockers should not be routinely withheld from patients with COPD.

### Beta blockers for heart failure due to coronary artery disease… [^113VotJK]. AAFP (1998). Low credibility.

Beta-adrenergic blockers are generally considered to be contraindicated in patients with heart failure because of their negative inotropic effect. Sympathetic activation, however, is associated with an adverse prognosis in patients with heart failure. This observation has led to studies of the role of beta blockers in this population. Haim and associates evaluated the long-term effects of beta-blocker therapy in patients with coronary artery disease and heart failure in New York Heart Association functional classes II and III inhibitors. editor's note: The deterioration of cardiac function that occurs with heart failure is secondary to compensatory mechanisms, including neurohormonal activation involving the sympathetic nervous system and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone hormonal axis. Such protracted alterations lead to ventricular dilatation, increased myocardial energy demand, impaired diastolic function, systemic vasoconstriction, arrhythmias and heart failure. Halting these events with ACE inhibitors slows the progression of heart failure. Beta-adrenergic blockers may do the same, as well as exert antiarrhythmic effects.

Compared with first-generation beta blockers, second-generation agents selective for beta 1 receptors, which include metoprolol, atenolol, bisoprolol and betaxolol, are not as likely to produce systemic vasoconstriction. Thus, they may be of benefit in patients with heart failure when they are used in combination with ACE inhibitors. Third-generation beta blockers, which include carvedilol, labe-tolol, pindolol and sotalol, may have even better myocardial protective properties. Slow titration of beta-blocker therapy is important in these patients, and symptomatic improvement, possibly preceded by a period of decompensation, may require up to three months. It is becoming clear that selected beta blockers can be used in combination with ACE inhibitors in the treatment of mild to moderate heart failure. This approach may delay progression of heart failure and improve survival. — r. s.

### Cardioselective β-blockers for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a meta-analysis [^116bECTV]. Respiratory Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Beta-blocker therapy has a mortality benefit in patients with hypertension, heart failure and coronary artery disease, as well as during the perioperative period. These drugs have traditionally been considered contraindicated in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The objective of this study was to assess the effect of cardioselective beta-blockers on respiratory function of patients with COPD. Comprehensive searches were performed of the EMBASE, MEDLINE and CINAHL databases from 1966 to May 2001, and identified articles and related reviews were scanned. Randomised, blinded, controlled trials that studied the effects of cardioselective beta-blockers on the forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) or symptoms in patients with COPD were included in the analysis. Interventions studied were the administration of beta-blocker, given either as a single dose or for longer duration, and the use of beta2-agonist given after the study drug. Outcomes measured were the change in FEV1 from baseline and the number of patients with respiratory symptoms. Eleven studies of single-dose treatment and 8 of continued treatment were included. Cardioselective beta-blockers produced no significant change in FEV1 or respiratory symptoms compared to placebo, given as a single dose (-2.05% [95% CI, -6.05% to 1.96%]) or for longer duration (-2.55% [CI, -5.94% to 0.84]), and did not significantly affect the FEV1 treatment response to beta2-agonists. Subgroup analyses revealed no significant change in results for those participants with severe chronic airways obstruction or for those with a reversible obstructive component. In conclusion, cardioselective beta-blockers given to patients with COPD do not produce a significant reduction in airway function or increase the incidence of COPD exacerbations. Given their demonstrated benefit in conditions such as heart failure, coronary artery disease and hypertension, cardioselective beta-blockers should be considered for patients with COPD.

### ACC / AHA 2006 guideline update on perioperative cardiovascular evaluation for noncardiac surgery: focused update on perioperative β-blocker therapy: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on practice guidelines (writing committee to update the 2002 guidelines on perioperative cardiovascular evaluation for noncardiac surgery): developed in collaboration with the American Society of Echocardiography, American Society of Nuclear Cardiology, Heart Rhythm Society, Society of Cardiovascular Anesthesiologists, Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions, and Society for Vascular Medicine and biology [^113TGbue]. Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

ACC/AHA perioperative beta-blocker therapy — directive statements and cautions: Beta blockers are probably recommended for patients in whom preoperative assessment identifies coronary heart disease or high cardiac risk as defined by the presence of multiple clinical risk factors and who are undergoing intermediate- or high-risk procedures as defined in these guidelines (Level of Evidence: B). Beta blockers may be considered for patients who are undergoing intermediate- or high-risk procedures as defined in these guidelines, including vascular surgery, in whom preoperative assessment identifies intermediate cardiac risk as defined by the presence of a single clinical risk factor (Level of Evidence: C). Beta blockers may be considered in patients undergoing vascular surgery with low cardiac risk (as defined in these guidelines) who are not currently on beta blockers (Level of Evidence: C). Beta blockers should not be given to patients undergoing surgery who have absolute contraindications to beta blockade (Level of Evidence: C). High cardiac risk includes patients with major and intermediate clinical predictors, and care should be taken in applying recommendations on beta-blocker therapy to patients with decompensated heart failure, nonischemic cardiomyopathy, high-degree AV block, or severe valvular heart disease in the absence of coronary heart disease.

### Cardioselective β-blockers for reversible airway disease [^1169LAdG]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Beta-blocker therapy has mortality benefit in patients with hypertension, heart failure and coronary artery disease, as well as during the perioperative period. These drugs have traditionally been considered contraindicated in patients with reversible airway disease.

Objectives

To assess the effect of cardioselective beta-blockers in patients with asthma or COPD.

Search Strategy

A search of EMBASE, MEDLINE and CINAHL was performed up to May 2002 using the terms: asthma*, bronchial hyperreactivity*, respiratory sounds*, wheez*, obstructive lung disease* or obstructive airway disease*, and adrenergic antagonist*, sympatholytic* or adrenergic receptor block*.

Selection Criteria

Randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled trials of single dose or continued treatment of the effects of cardioselective beta-blockers in patients with reversible airway disease.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two independent reviewers extracted data from the selected articles, reconciling differences by consensus. Beta1-blockers were divided into those with or without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA). Interventions were: administration of single or continued beta1-blocker, and response to beta2-agonist given after the study drug.

Main Results

Nineteen studies on single-dose treatment and 10 studies on continued treatment met the inclusion criteria. Single dose cardioselective beta-blocker produced a 7.46% (95% CI 5.59, 9.32) reduction in FEV1, but with a 4.63% (95% CI 2.47, 6.78) increase in FEV1 with beta2-agonist, compared to placebo. Treatment lasting 3–28 days produced no change in FEV1 (-0.42%; 95% CI -3.74, 2.91), symptoms or inhaler use, whilst maintaining a 8.74% (95% CI 1.96, 15.52) response to beta2-agonist. There was no significant change in FEV1 treatment effect for those patients with COPD: single doses -5.28% (95% CI -10.03, -0.54%), continued treatment 1.07% (CI -3.3, 5.44. With continued treatment there was no significant difference in FEV1 response for beta1-blockers without ISA compared to those with IS: -3.22% (96%CI -7.79, 1.36) compared to 2.72% (95% CI -2.12, 7.59). Those without ISA produced a 12.0% increase in FEV1 after beta2-agonist administration compared to placebo (95%CI 4.12,19.87) while beta1-blockers with ISA produced no change compared to placebo (-0.60% [95%CI -13.93, 12.73). These results were obtained in a small number od studies of few patients. The difference was not significant.

Reviewer's Conclusions

Cardioselective beta-blockers given in mild - moderate reversible airway disease or COPD, do not produce adverse respiratory effects in the short term. Given their demonstrated benefit in conditions such as heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias and hypertension, these agents should not be withheld from such patients, but long term safety (especially their impact during an acute exacerbation) still needs to be established.

Regarding medical management for coronary artery disease, more specifically with respect to management of HF, ESC 2024 guidelines recommend to initiate an ACEi, a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, an SGLT-2 inhibitor (dapagliflozin or empagliflozin), and, in stable conditions, a β-blocker in patients with chronic coronary syndrome and HFrEF to reduce the risk of HF hospitalization and death.

### Beta-blockers and outcome in patients with suspected coronary artery disease evaluated noninvasively [^116Ba6jD]. The American Journal of Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Our intent was to assess the relationship between beta-blocker use and outcomes in patients with chronic coronary artery disease diagnosed using noninvasive testing but without myocardial infarction or heart failure.

Methods

Data from the Prospective Multicenter Imaging Study for Evaluation of Chest Pain (PROMISE) study, a prospective randomized trial comparing the effectiveness of 2 noninvasive tests in patients with a low-to-intermediate likelihood of coronary artery disease, were subjected to post hoc analysis. Patients with a history of myocardial infarction or heart failure and those with missing data on beta-blocker use at baseline were excluded. Associations between baseline beta-blocker use and the primary composite outcome (all-cause death / myocardial infarction / unstable angina hospitalization) and secondary composite outcomes (cardiovascular death / myocardial infarction / unstable angina hospitalization, and myocardial infarction / unstable angina hospitalization) over a median follow-up period of 793 days were analyzed.

Results

In total, 8,250 patients were enrolled and stratified into negative (87.5%, n = 7,215) and positive (12.5%, n = 1,035) cohorts based on noninvasive test results, of which 23.9% and 28.6% received beta-blockers, respectively. In both cohorts, patients who received beta-blockers had a similar risk of the primary composite outcome compared to those who did not receive beta-blockers (negative cohort: adjusted hazard ratio = 1.106, P = 0.586; positive cohort: adjusted hazard ratio = 1.077, P = 0.759). Similar results were observed for the secondary composite outcomes.

Conclusions

This non-randomized study showed that beta-blocker use did not affect the clinical outcomes in patients with chronic coronary artery disease diagnosed using noninvasive testing, if they had no myocardial infarction or heart failure.

### Β-blocker therapy prior to admission for acute coronary syndrome in Patients without heart failure or left ventricular dysfunction improves in-hospital and 12-month outcome: results from the GULF-RACE 2 (gulf registry of acute coronary events-2) [^113ZUvTz]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

European and American guidelines regarding BB use post‐MI are conflicting, especially regarding the duration of the treatment. The American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology 2013 guidelines for STEMI recommend that BB should be used in the long term in patients without HF, unless contraindicated. 29 The 2014 NTEMI suggest that it might be reasonable to prescribe BB in non‐HF patients indefinitely (Class IIa). 30 However, in both scenarios, the long term is limited to 3 years according to the 2011 AHA/American College of Cardiology secondary prevention update (Class I), and any therapy beyond 3 years might be reasonable (Class IIa). 31 In the absence of trials in the postreperfusion era, the European Society of Cardiology 2012 STEMI guidelines have switched the level of recommendation of long‐term BB therapy from class I to IIa in 2012, 32 and kept the same class in the recently published 2017 guidelines. 33 Interestingly, no specific guidance for the use of BB in patients without HF was published in the 2015 European Society of Cardiology non‐ST‐elevation MI guidelines. 34 In the light of our results, it might be reasonable to consider BB in primary prevention for high‐risk patients — such as those with hypertension and diabetes mellitus — in order to improve mortality when those patients develop an ACS. Nevertheless, replication of our data in other registries and doing a randomized clinical trial are mandatory before any formal recommendation.

Perioperative beta blockade — summary recommendations specify that there is "a Class I indication for perioperative beta-blocker use" for continuation in patients already taking a beta blocker; "several Class IIa recommendations exist" for patients with inducible ischemia, coronary artery disease, or multiple clinical risk factors undergoing vascular (high-risk) surgery and for those with coronary artery disease or multiple clinical risk factors undergoing intermediate-risk surgery. "Initiation of therapy, particularly in lower-risk groups, requires careful consideration of the risk-benefit ratio for an individual patient", and "Intensive dose titration well before a planned procedure with careful titration perioperatively to achieve adequate heart rate control while avoiding frank bradycardia or hypotension is also suggested". "In light of the POISE results, routine administration of perioperative beta blockers, particularly in higher fixed-dose regimens begun on the day of surgery, cannot be advocated".

### Cardioselective β-blocker use in patients with reversible airway disease [^1163Pb7L]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Beta-blocker therapy has mortality benefit in patients with hypertension, heart failure and coronary artery disease, as well as during the perioperative period. These drugs have traditionally been considered contraindicated in patients with reversible airway disease.

Objectives

To assess the effect of cardioselective beta-blockers on respiratory function of patients with reversible airway disease. Reversible airway disease was defined as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with a reversible obstructive component.

Search Strategy

A comprehensive search of EMBASE, MEDLINE and CINAHL was performed using the Cochrane Airways Group registry to identify randomized blinded placebo-controlled trials from 1966 to February, 2000. The search was completed using the terms: asthma*, bronchial hyperreactivity*, respiratory sounds*, wheez*, obstructive lung disease* or obstructive airway disease*, and adrenergic antagonist*, sympatholytic* or adrenergic receptor block*. We did not exclude trials on the basis of language.

Selection Criteria

Randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled trials of single dose or longer duration that studied the effects of cardioselective beta-blockers on the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), symptoms and use of short-acting inhaled beta-agonists, in patients with reversible airway disease. Reversible airway disease was documented by response to methacholine challenge, by an increase in FEV1 of at least 15% to beta-agonist administration, or the presence of asthma as defined by the American Thoracic Society.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two independent reviewers extracted data from the selected articles, reconciling differences by consensus. Cardioselective beta-blockers were divided into 2 groups, those with or without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA). Two interventions studied were the administration of beta-blocker, given either as a single dose or for longer duration, and the use of beta-agonist given after the study drug.

Main Results

Nineteen studies for single-dose treatment and 10 for treatment of longer duration met selection criteria. The patients had mild-moderate airways obstruction. For cardioselective beta-blockers taken as a group, administration of a single dose was associated with a 7.98% (CI, 6.19 to 9.77%) reduction in FEV1, but with a 13.16% (CI, 10.76 to 15.56%) increase in beta-agonist response, as compared to placebo. There was no increase in symptoms. After treatment lasting a few days to a few weeks, there was no decrement in FEV1 compared to placebo and no increase in symptoms or inhaler use. Regular use of cardioselective beta-blockers without ISA produced a 13.13% (CI, 5.97 to 20.30) increase in beta-agonist response compared to placebo, a response not seen with beta-blockers containing ISA (-0.60% [CI, -11.7 to +10.5%]).

Reviewer's Conclusions

Cardioselective beta-blockers, given to patients with mild-moderate reversible airway disease, do not produce clinically significant adverse respiratory effects in the short term. It is not possible to comment on their effects in patient with more severe or less reversible disease, or on their effect on the frequency or severity of acute exacerbations. Given their demonstrated benefit in conditions such as heart failure, coronary artery disease and hypertension, cardioselective beta-blockers should not be withheld from patients with mild-moderate reversible airway disease.

### Bisoprolol fumarate [^114svzXb]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

WARNINGS

Cardiac Failure

Sympathetic stimulation is a vital component supporting circulatory function in the setting of congestive heart failure, and beta-blockade may result in further depression of myocardial contractility and precipitate more severe failure. In general, beta-blocking agents should be avoided in patients with overt congestive failure. However, in some patients with compensated cardiac failure it may be necessary to utilize them. In such a situation, they must be used cautiously. In Patients Without a History of Cardiac Failure

Continued depression of the myocardium with beta-blockers can, in some patients, precipitate cardiac failure. At the first signs or symptoms of heart failure, discontinuation of bisoprolol fumarate should be considered. In some cases, beta-blocker therapy can be continued while heart failure is treated with other drugs. Abrupt Cessation of Therapy

Exacerbation of angina pectoris, and, in some instances, myocardial infarction or ventricular arrhythmia, have been observed in patients with coronary artery disease following abrupt cessation of therapy with beta-blockers. Such patients should, therefore, be cautioned against interruption or discontinuation of therapy without the physician's advice. Even in patients without overt coronary artery disease, it may be advisable to taper therapy with bisoprolol fumarate over approximately one week with the patient under careful observation. If withdrawal symptoms occur, bisoprolol fumarate therapy should be reinstituted, at least temporarily.

 Peripheral Vascular Disease

Beta-blockers can precipitate or aggravate symptoms of arterial insufficiency in patients with peripheral vascular disease. Caution should be exercised in such individuals.

### Practical considerations of β-blockade in the management of the post-myocardial infarction patient [^113agA6b]. American Heart Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is a major cause of death and disability in the United States that affects an estimated total of 1.5 million men and women each year. Despite significant advances in pharmacologic and interventional therapies, 25% of men and 38% of women still die within 1 year of the acute event. Beta-blockers have been shown to significantly decrease the risk of morbidity and mortality in patients after an AMI. National guidelines recommend that all patients with AMI may be started on beta-blocker therapy and continued indefinitely, unless absolutely contraindicated or not tolerated. However, a substantial portion of eligible AMI survivors are not prescribed beta-blockers in the hospital after an acute event or upon hospital discharge. In addition, patients with AMI are often treated with agents whose long-term use has not been shown effective and for which optimal dosing has not been defined. This paper will discuss the background of beta-blocker use for the treatment of AMI, discuss the rationale for choosing specific agents, and present protocols for initiating or switching to evidence-based therapies.

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Practical use of beta-blockers — selection of patients and initiation: Beta-blockers should be prescribed to all patients with stable HF due to reduced LVEF unless they have a contraindication or are unable to tolerate them, and treatment with a beta-blocker should be initiated as soon as left ventricular (LV) dysfunction is diagnosed. Therapy should not be delayed until symptoms return or disease progression is documented, and even patients with little disability should receive treatment with a beta-blocker to reduce the risk of disease progression, future clinical deterioration, and sudden death. Patients need not be taking high doses of ACEIs prior to starting a beta-blocker, and in those taking a low dose of an ACEI, adding a beta-blocker produces a greater improvement in symptoms and reduction in risk of death than increasing the ACEI dose to trial targets. In patients with a current or recent history of fluid retention, beta-blockers should not be prescribed without diuretics.

### Stable coronary artery disease: are there therapeutic benefits of heart rate lowering? [^116UeDAq]. Journal of Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

A physiologically lower heart rate, such as that seen in athletes, has been associated with better survival in epidemiological studies. In patients with coronary artery disease, heart rate is considered an independent risk factor for adverse outcomes. Higher heart rate increases cardiac work load and oxygen demand and reduces coronary perfusion by decreasing the amount of time spent in diastole, which in patients with obstructive coronary artery disease can trigger angina and myocardial infarction. Whether pharmacological reduction in heart rate by using a beta-blocker or ivabradine improves prognosis has been debated. In this review, we explore the effect of pharmacological heart rate lowering with a beta-blocker or ivabradine on cardiovascular outcomes in patients with cardiovascular disease and address the question as to whether pharmacological heart rate reduction is ready for prime time in the management of patients with coronary artery disease. Although physiologically lower heart rates are associated with improved survival, the effect of pharmacological heart rate reduction with beta-blockers (in patients without heart failure or postmyocardial infarction) or ivabradine on improvement in survival is weak at best.

### Bisoprolol fumarate and hydrochlorothiazide (bisoprolol fumarate hydrochlorothiazide) [^11684B7e]. FDA (2006). Low credibility.

WARNINGS

Cardiac Failure

In general, beta-blocking agents should be avoided in patients with overt congestive heart failure. However, in some patients with compensated cardiac failure, it may be necessary to utilize these agents. In such situations, they must be used cautiously.

Patients Without a History of Cardiac Failure

Continued depression of the myocardium with beta-blockers can, in some patients, precipitate cardiac failure. At the first signs or symptoms of heart failure, discontinuation of bisoprolol and hydrochlorothiazide should be considered. In some cases bisoprolol and hydrochlorothiazide therapy can be continued while heart failure is treated with other drugs.

Abrupt Cessation of Therapy

Exacerbations of angina pectoris and, in some instances, myocardial infarction or ventricular arrhythmia, have been observed in patients with coronary artery disease following abrupt cessation of therapy with beta-blockers. Such patients should, therefore, be cautioned against interruption or discontinuation of therapy without the physician's advice. Even in patients without overt coronary artery disease, it may be advisable to taper therapy with bisoprolol and hydrochlorothiazide over approximately 1 week with the patient under careful observation. If withdrawal symptoms occur, beta-blocking therapy should be reinstituted, at least temporarily.

Peripheral Vascular Disease

Beta-blockers can precipitate or aggravate symptoms of arterial insufficiency in patients with peripheral vascular disease. Caution should be exercised in such individuals.

### Beta-blockers after PCI for stable coronary artery disease and preserved left ventricular ejection fraction [^113R4ndx]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Beta-adrenergic receptor blockers have been a cornerstone in managing coronary artery disease (CAD) since early randomized controlled trials demonstrated their survival benefits after acute myocardial infarction (MI). Current American Heart Association/American College of Cardiologyguidelines recommend beta-blocker use in patients with MI, those with left ventricular dysfunction (left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF] of ≤ 50%) or systolic heart failure (HF) to mitigate the risk of cardiovascular events.

Given the limited data, the current professional guidelines do not encourage the use of beta-blocker therapy after revascularization for stable CAD patients who do not have left ventricular dysfunction. However, a recent study revealed a reduction in primary composite endpoint (all-cause death and hospitalization for HF or MI; HR: 0.92 [95% CI: 0.86–0.98]), primarily driven by hospitalization for MI (0.87 [95% CI: 0.77–0.99]). Subgroup analysis for the primary endpoint showed no significant interaction based on percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) within 90 days postindex (P for interaction = 0.49) and LVEF (P for interaction = 0.21).

Prior observational studies were affected by several potential biases, such as confounding by indication, where the clinical indication for the treatment may be inherently linked to the outcome; survivor treatment selection bias, which occurs when patients who live longer have more opportunities to receive treatment, leading to a fundamental difference between them and those who die earlier may remain untreated by default, immortal time bias; and prevalent user bias, significantly distorting the potential treatment effects of the therapy. Furthermore, skepticism exists in the scientific community regarding the likelihood of conducting a randomized trial to assess beta-blockade in stable CAD after PCI, considering the vast scale required for such a trial and the generic status of beta-blockers, which may diminish financial incentives for funding. In this context, we conducted a target trial emulation study to assess whether a strategy of early initiation of oral beta-blockade in patients with stable CAD and preserved LVEF after PCI influences all-cause mortality and cardiovascular outcomes and to evaluate the safety profile of this therapeutic strategy within this cohort.

### Beta-blocker efficacy across different cardiovascular indications: an umbrella review and meta-analytic assessment [^113H9m2z]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This umbrella review across cardiovascular indications used meta-analytic data to clarify the evidence basis for beta-blockers in contemporary clinical practice (Table 1, Fig. 5). In patients with coronary disease, there is a trade-off between benefit and risk. Beta-blockers reduced the risk of incident MI at the expense of higher rates of incident HF, with no effect on mortality. In patients with HFrEF in sinus rhythm, beta-blockers reduced morbidity and mortality, but they had no effect in HFrEF with concomitant atrial fibrillation or those with preserved LVEF. In perioperative patients, although beta-blockers reduced the risk of incident MI in those undergoing non-cardiac surgery, this was at the expense of increased mortality and stroke. Beta-blockers had no effect on any of the outcomes assessed in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. In hypertension, although beta-blockers had no significant effect compared to placebo or diuretics, they were inferior to RAS antagonists and CCB. These findings highlight the importance of an individualised assessment of indication, comorbidity and understanding of the goal of therapy before routine commencement of beta-blockers.

### Beta-blocker therapy after myocardial Infarction [^117VTnAL]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the most common cardiovascular disease (CVD) and a leading cause of mortality and disability worldwide. In 2022, ischemic heart disease, which includes CAD, accounted for the highest global cardiovascular mortality, with an age-standardized rate of 108.8 deaths per 100,000 people, underscoring its public health burden. Characterized by reduced or blocked oxygen flow to the heart, ischemic heart disease is chronic and dynamic in nature. Acute coronary syndrome (ACS), such as acute myocardial infarction (MI), arises from atherosclerotic plaque rupture or erosion.CAD and MI incur significant health care costs, projected to surpass US$1 trillion globally by 2030.

Despite significant advancements in MI treatment, several gaps remain, particularly regarding the optimal use and effectiveness of beta-blocker therapy following MI in patients with normal versus reduced heart function (ie, those with left ventricular dysfunction). While beta-blocker therapy has been a cornerstone in managing MI due to its ability to reduce myocardial oxygen demand, prevent arrhythmias, and improve survival rates, its effectiveness for patients with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) or without heart failure remains unclear. Recent reviews have reported mixed findings regarding the long-term effects of beta-blocker therapy, and have unveiled the fact that most of the evidence suggesting its significant CV mortality and morbidity benefits was derived from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) conducted in the prereperfusion era (Central Illustration). This presents a critical gap, as current clinical guidelines are based on outdated evidence and lack data from comprehensive RCTs and real-world evidence (RWE) that accurately reflect today's diverse patient populations seen in clinical practice. There is a need for up-to-date, broader and more representative studies that provide insights into the effectiveness of beta-blocker therapyin the context of modern revascularization procedures and newer pharmacotherapies that have improved post-MI outcomes.

### Ivabradine for stable angina? [^111heAwR]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2008). Low credibility.

Up to 1 in 25 people in Europe and the USA have stable angina, with symptoms that may limit function and quality of life. Beta-blockers are usually used in initial symptomatic treatment, but may cause unwanted effects. They are also contraindicated in some patients (e.g. those with uncontrolled heart failure, severe peripheral vascular disease) and should be avoided in patients with asthma or a history of reversible obstructive airways disease or bronchospasm. Ivabradine (Procoralan-Servier) is the first in a new class of specific heart rate-reducing drugs and is licensed for the "symptomatic treatment of chronic stable angina pectoris in patients with normal sinus rhythm, who have a contra-indication or intolerance for beta-blockers". Here we consider the place of ivabradine in the management of patients with stable angina.

All Class I recommendations for Stage A should apply to patients with cardiac structural abnormalities who have not developed HF (Levels of Evidence: A, B, and C as appropriate).

Beta-blockers are indicated in all patients without a history of MI who have a reduced LVEF with no HF symptoms (see Table 3 and text) (Level of Evidence: C). Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors should be used in patients with a reduced EF and no symptoms of HF, even if they have not experienced MI (Level of Evidence: A). An ARB should be administered to post-MI patients without HF who are intolerant of ACEIs and have a low LVEF (Level of Evidence: B). Patients who have not developed HF symptoms should be treated according to contemporary guidelines after an acute MI (Level of Evidence: C). Coronary revascularization should be recommended in appropriate patients without symptoms of HF in accordance with contemporary guidelines (Level of Evidence: A). Valve replacement or repair should be recommended for patients with hemodynamically significant valvular stenosis or regurgitation and no symptoms of HF in accordance with contemporary guidelines (Level of Evidence: B).

### Beta-blockers after myocardial infarction in patients without heart failure [^1125XUnk]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

Background

The evidence supporting beta-blocker therapy after myocardial infarction was established before the introduction of modern coronary reperfusion therapy and secondary prevention strategies.

Methods

In an open-label, randomized trial with blinded end-point evaluation, conducted in Denmark and Norway, we assigned patients who had had a myocardial infarction and who had a left ventricular ejection fraction of at least 40%, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive long-term beta-blocker therapy within 14 days after the event or no beta-blocker therapy. The primary end point was a composite of death from any cause or major adverse cardiovascular events (new myocardial infarction, unplanned coronary revascularization, ischemic stroke, heart failure, or malignant ventricular arrhythmias).

Results

A total of 5574 patients underwent randomization and were included in the main analyses - 2783 in the beta-blocker group and 2791 in the no-beta-blocker group. After a median follow-up of 3.5 years (interquartile range, 2.2 to 4.6), a primary end-point event had occurred in 394 patients (14.2%) in the beta-blocker group and in 454 patients (16.3%) in the no-beta-blocker group (hazard ratio, 0.85; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.75 to 0.98; P = 0.03). Death from any cause occurred in 4.2% of the patients in the beta-blocker group and in 4.4% of those in the no-beta-blocker group; myocardial infarction occurred in 5.0% and 6.7%, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.59 to 0.92), unplanned coronary revascularization in 3.9% and 3.9%, ischemic stroke in 1.6% and 1.3%, heart failure in 1.5% and 1.9%, and malignant ventricular arrhythmias in 0.5% and 0.6%. No apparent differences in safety outcomes were observed between the groups.

Conclusions

Among patients with a myocardial infarction and a left ventricular ejection fraction of at least 40%, beta-blocker therapy led to a lower risk of death or major adverse cardiovascular events than no beta-blocker therapy.

### Acebutolol hydrochloride [^113JYp7c]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

WARNINGS

Cardiac Failure

Sympathetic stimulation may be essential for support of the circulation in individuals with diminished myocardial contractility, and its inhibition by β-adrenergic receptor blockade may precipitate more severe failure. Although β-blockers should be avoided in overt cardiac failure, acebutolol can be used with caution in patients with a history of heart failure who are controlled with digitalis and/or diuretics. Both digitalis and acebutolol impair AV conduction. If cardiac failure persists, therapy with acebutolol should be withdrawn.

In Patients Without a History of Cardiac Failure

In patients with aortic or mitral valve disease or compromised left ventricular function, continued depression of the myocardium with β-blocking agents over a period of time may lead to cardiac failure. At the first signs of failure, patients should be digitalized and/or be given a diuretic and the response observed closely. If cardiac failure continues despite adequate digitalization and/or diuretic, acebutolol therapy should be withdrawn.

Exacerbation of Ischemic Heart Disease Following Abrupt Withdrawal

Following abrupt cessation of therapy with certain β-blocking agents in patients with coronary artery disease, exacerbation of angina pectoris and, in some cases, myocardial infarction and death have been reported. Therefore, such patients should be cautioned against interruption of therapy without a physician's advice. Even in the absence of overt ischemic heart disease, when discontinuation of acebutolol is planned, the patient should be carefully observed, and should be advised to limit physical activity to a minimum while acebutolol is gradually withdrawn over a period of about two weeks. (If therapy with an alternative β-blocker is desired, the patient may be transferred directly to comparable doses of another agent without interruption of β-blocking therapy.) If an exacerbation of angina pectoris occurs, antianginal therapy should be restarted immediately in full doses and the patient hospitalized until his condition stabilizes.

### Beta-blocker efficacy across different cardiovascular indications: an umbrella review and meta-analytic assessment [^114uCCYB]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Beta-blockers are widely used for many cardiovascular conditions; however, their efficacy in contemporary clinical practice remains uncertain.

Methods

We performed a prospectively designed, umbrella review of meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the evidence of beta-blockers in the contemporary management of coronary artery disease (CAD), heart failure (HF), patients undergoing surgery or hypertension (registration: PROSPERO CRD42016038375). We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library from inception until December 2018. Outcomes were analysed as beta-blockers versus control for all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction (MI), incident HF or stroke. Two independent investigators abstracted the data, assessed the quality of the evidence and rated the certainty of evidence.

Results

We identified 98 meta-analyses, including 284 unique RCTs and 1,617,523 patient-years of follow-up. In CAD, 12 meta-analyses (93 RCTs, 103,481 patients) showed that beta-blockers reduced mortality in analyses before routine reperfusion, but there was a lack of benefit in contemporary studies where ≥ 50% of patients received thrombolytics or intervention. Beta-blockers reduced incident MI at the expense of increased HF. In HF with reduced ejection fraction, 34 meta-analyses (66 RCTs, 35,383 patients) demonstrated a reduction in mortality and HF hospitalisation with beta-blockers in sinus rhythm, but not in atrial fibrillation. In patients undergoing surgery, 23 meta-analyses (89 RCTs, 19,211 patients) showed no effect of beta-blockers on mortality for cardiac surgery, but increased mortality in non-cardiac surgery. In non-cardiac surgery, beta-blockers reduced MI after surgery but increased the risk of stroke. In hypertension, 27 meta-analyses (36 RCTs, 260,549 patients) identified no benefit versus placebo, but beta-blockers were inferior to other agents for preventing mortality and stroke.

Conclusions

Beta-blockers substantially reduce mortality in HF patients in sinus rhythm, but for other conditions, clinicians need to weigh up both benefit and potential risk.

### Ivabradine [^115mCXtf]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

BEAUTIFUL and SIGNIFY: No benefit in stable coronary artery disease with or without stable heart failure

The Morbidity-mortality Evaluation of the IfInhibitor Ivabradine in Patients with Coronary Disease and Left Ventricular Dysfunction Trial (BEAUTIFUL) was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 10,917 adult patients with coronary artery disease, impaired left ventricular systolic function (ejection fraction < 40%) and resting heart rate ≥ 60 bpm. Patients had stable symptoms of heart failure and/or angina for at least 3 months and were receiving conventional cardiovascular medications at stable doses for at least 1 month. Beta-blocker therapy was not required, nor was there a protocol mandate to achieve any specific dosing targets for patients who were taking beta-blockers. Patients were randomized 1:1 to ivabradine or placebo at an initial dose of 5 mg twice daily with the dose increased to 7.5 mg twice daily depending on resting heart rate and tolerability. The primary endpoint was the composite of time to first cardiovascular death, hospitalization for acute myocardial infarction, or hospitalization for new-onset or worsening heart failure. Most patients were NYHA class II (61.4%) or class III (23.2%) - none were class IV. Through a median follow-up of 19 months, ivabradine did not significantly affect the primary composite endpoint (HR 1.00, 95% CI = 0.91, 1.10).

The Study Assessing the Morbi-mortality Benefits of the IfInhibitor Ivabradine in Patients with Coronary Artery Disease Trial (SIGNIFY) was a randomized, double-blind trial administering ivabradine or placebo to 19,102 adult patients with stable coronary artery disease but without clinically evident heart failure (NYHA class I). Beta-blocker therapy was not required. Ivabradine was initiated at a dose of 7.5 mg twice daily and the dose could be increased to as high as 10 mg twice daily or down-titrated to 5 mg twice daily to achieve a target heart rate of 55 to 60 bpm. The primary endpoint was a composite of the first occurrence of either cardiovascular death or myocardial infarction. Through a median follow-up of 24.1 months, ivabradine did not significantly affect the primary composite endpoint (HR 1.08, 95% CI = 0.96, 1.20).

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of hypertension in the primary care setting [^1174fzbZ]. VA/DoD (2020). High credibility.

Pharmacological treatment for hypertension — other outcomes and beta blocker considerations: The Work Group did not make a formal recommendation for other outcomes such as stroke or heart failure reduction alone, but notable findings were that thiazide-type diuretics were superior to other drug classes for preventing CHF outcomes, CCBs were superior for reducing all-cause mortality, and CCBs were inferior for preventing CHF outcomes; ACEIs and ARBs are not used concomitantly due to recognized safety risks. Although the evidence was not supportive of a recommendation, providers can consider beta blockers as an alternative for patients with compelling indications (e.g., underlying coronary artery disease, following myocardial infarction, or in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction), and patients intolerant to the four main classes may also consider a beta blocker; the systematic review found beta blockers were equivalent to ARBs for composite cardiovascular outcomes with no significant difference versus CCBs or thiazide-type diuretics and no critical outcomes versus ACEIs, but some important outcomes showed beta blockers were inferior, particularly for stroke reduction; beta blockers are not recommended as initial antihypertensive therapy.

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Chronic heart failure — trial populations and outcomes with beta-blockers: Beta-blockers have been evaluated in more than 20 000 patients across more than 20 published placebo-controlled trials, enrolling patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) defined as EF less than 35% to 45% who were already treated with diuretics and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), with or without digitalis. Trials generally excluded or underrepresented patients with preserved systolic function, low heart rates (less than 65 beats per min), low systolic blood pressure (less than 85 mm Hg), hospitalization, or class IV HF; one carvedilol trial enrolled clinically stable NYHA class III and IV patients free of edema and showed a mortality reduction similar to less advanced disease. Collectively, long-term beta-blocker therapy can lessen HF symptoms, improve clinical status and well-being, and reduce the risk of death and the combined risk of death or hospitalization, with benefits seen regardless of coronary artery disease or diabetes status and in women and black patients; favorable effects were also observed in patients already taking ACEIs, suggesting additive effects from combined blockade of the 2 neurohormonal systems.

### Association of beta-blocker therapy with cardiovascular outcomes in patients with Stable Ischemic heart Disease [^114feHCu]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Previous studies have failed to show a cardioprotective benefit of beta-blockers in patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD).

Objectives

This study sought to determine the association between beta-blockers and cardiovascular events in patients with stable CAD using a new user design.

Methods

All patients aged > 66 years undergoing elective coronary angiography in Ontario, Canada, from 2009 to 2019 with diagnosed obstructive CAD were included. Exclusion criteria included heart failure or a recent myocardial infarction, as well as having a beta-blocker prescription claim in the previous year. Beta-blocker use was defined as having at least 1 beta-blocker prescription claim in the 90 days preceding or after the index coronary angiography. The main outcome was a composite of all-cause mortality and hospitalization for heart failure or myocardial infarction. Inverse probability of treatment weighting using the propensity score was used to account for confounding.

Results

This study included 28,039 patients (mean age: 73.0 ± 5.6 years; 66.2% male), and 12,695 of those (45.3%) were newly prescribed beta-blockers. The 5-year risks of the primary outcome were 14.3% in the beta-blocker group and 16.1% in the no beta-blocker group (absolute risk reduction: -1.8%; 95% CI: -2.8 to -0.8; HR: 0.92; 95% CI: 0.86–0.98; P = 0.006). This result was driven by reductions in myocardial infarction hospitalization (cause-specific HR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.77–0.99; P = 0.031), whereas no differences were observed in all-cause death or heart failure hospitalization.

Conclusions

In patients with angiographically documented stable CAD without heart failure or a recent myocardial infarction, beta-blockers were associated with a small but significant reduction in cardiovascular events at 5 years.

### American college of cardiology / American Heart Association chronic heart failure evaluation and management guidelines: relevance to the geriatric practice [^115yovp1]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Heart failure (HF) is the only cardiovascular disease with increasing incidence and prevalence. Most HF patients are older adults. With the aging of the population and effective treatment of hypertension and coronary artery disease, the two major underlying causes of HF, the number of older Americans with HF is expected to rise significantly in the coming decades. HF is the number one hospital discharge diagnosis for older adults. It is one of the causes of frequent hospital readmissions, reflecting acute decompensation and compromised quality of life for patients and increased cost and resource use for the healthcare system. It is also associated with approximately 300,000 deaths annually, most in older adults. Advances in the management of HF in the past several decades have significantly decreased the mortality and morbidity associated with this condition. Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated the beneficial effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, beta-blockers, and spironolactone on survival and quality of life of HF patients, but there is evidence of underuse of evidence-based care for HF. Several national guidelines have been published since 1994 that recommended evidence-based evaluation and management of HF. In 1995, the American College of Cardiologists (ACC) and the American Heart Association (AHA) published their first HF guidelines that recommended left ventricular (LV) function evaluation for all patients presenting with HF and use of ACE inhibitors for all patients with LV systolic dysfunction (LVSD) unless contraindicated. The guidelines recommended the use of hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate in patients who could not use ACE inhibitors. In addition, digoxin was recommended in patients with HF due to LVSD but not adequately responsive to ACE inhibitors and diuretics and in those with atrial fibrillation and rapid ventricular rates. Diuretic use was recommended for symptomatic patients with evidence of fluid overload. Use of anticoagulation was restricted to patients with atrial fibrillation or to those with a history of systemic or pulmonary embolism. Beta-blockers were reserved for HF patients after acute myocardial infarctions. Recent advances in the management of HF called for a revision of the guidelines.

Purpose

The purpose of revising the 1995 ACC/AHA guidelines was to incorporate recent advances in pharmacological and nonpharmacological approaches to HF treatment and to assist physicians in clinical decision-making in the management of HF.

Methods

The ACC/AHA invited representatives from the American College of Chest Physicians, the Heart Failure Society of America, the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation, the American Academy of Family Physicians, and the American College of Physicians-American Society of Internal Medicine to participate in the preparation of the guidelines. The writing committee searched pertinent medical literature in English using computerized databases such as MEDLINE and EMBASE and manually searching the bibliographies of the selected articles. The writing committee classified HF into four stages, including patients who are at high risk for developing HF. According to this new classification, Stage A and B represent asymptomatic patients, the former at high risk for developing HF but no structural disorder, the latter with structural disorders of the heart. Stage C encompasses patients with underlying structural heart disorders who are symptomatic, either currently or in the past. Stage D includes end-stage HF patients. This new classification is intended to complement the New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification of HF into Class I (asymptomatic), Class II (symptomatic on less than ordinary exertion), Class III (symptomatic on ordinary exertion), and Class IV (symptomatic at rest).

Results

The recommendations are categorized into those for evaluation and management.

### Perioperative issues: myocardial ischemia and protection – β-blockade [^117Bhmte]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Approximately one third of patients undergoing noncardiac surgery have coronary artery disease, and cardiovascular complications are an important cause of perioperative morbidity and mortality. Several algorithms are available to assess the risk for peri-operative cardiac events. Although preoperative risk assessment is useful in identifying patients at greatest risk for cardiac complications, recent investigations have provided additional guidance in choosing interventions to improve perioperative outcomes. These investigations show that perioperative beta-blockers significantly reduce morbidity and mortality in noncardiac surgery and appear to offer the greatest benefit to high-risk patients. Because of the lower complication rate in intermediate- and low-risk patients and the absence of large randomized controlled trials, the role of beta-blockers in this population is less well-defined.

### Bisoprolol fumarate (bisoprolol) [^11194Emn]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Cardiac Failure

Sympathetic stimulation is a vital component supporting circulatory function in the setting of congestive heart failure, and beta-blockade may result in further depression of myocardial contractility and precipitate more severe failure. In general, beta-blocking agents should be avoided in patients with overt congestive failure. However, in some patients with compensated cardiac failure it may be necessary to utilize them. In such a situation, they must be used cautiously.

In Patients Without a History of Cardiac Failure

Continued depression of the myocardium with beta-blockers can, in some patients, precipitate cardiac failure. At the first signs or symptoms of heart failure, discontinuation of bisoprolol fumarate tablets should be considered. In some cases, beta-blocker therapy can be continued while heart failure is treated with other drugs.

Abrupt Cessation of Therapy

Exacerbation of angina pectoris, and, in some instances, myocardial infarction or ventricular arrhythmia, have been observed in patients with coronary artery disease following abrupt cessation of therapy with beta-blockers. Such patients should, therefore, be cautioned against interruption or discontinuation of therapy without the physician's advice. Even in patients without overt coronary artery disease, it may be advisable to taper therapy with bisoprolol fumarate tablets over approximately one week with the patient under careful observation. If withdrawal symptoms occur, bisoprolol fumarate tablets therapy should be reinstituted, at least temporarily.

Peripheral Vascular Disease

Beta-blockers can precipitate or aggravate symptoms of arterial insufficiency in patients with peripheral vascular disease. Caution should be exercised in such individuals.

Bronchospastic Disease

PATIENTS WITH BRONCHOSPASTIC DISEASE SHOULD, IN GENERAL, NOT RECEIVE BETA-BLOCKERS. Because of its relative beta -selectivity, however, bisoprolol may be used with caution in patients with bronchospastic disease who do not respond to, or who cannot tolerate other antihypertensive treatment. Since beta -selectivity is not absolute, the lowest possible dose of bisoprolol fumarate tablets should be used, with therapy starting at 2.5 mg. A beta agonist (bronchodilator) should be made available.

Major Surgery

Chronically administered beta-blocking therapy should not be routinely withdrawn prior to major surgery; however, the impaired ability of the heart to respond to reflex adrenergic stimuli may augment the risks of general anesthesia and surgical procedures.

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Heart failure (HF) with concomitant angina pectoris — patients who have both angina pectoris and HF should be given drugs that relieve angina along with drugs that are appropriate in the management of HF; both nitrates and beta-blockers can improve anginal symptoms and may produce hemodynamic and clinical benefits in patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), and thus, they are preferred if these conditions coexist, and the decrease in ventricular volume and pressures produced by diuretics may exert independent antianginal effects. Because short-and long-term treatment with these drugs has increased the risk of worsening HF and death in patients with LV dysfunction, most calcium channel blockers should be avoided in patients with HF, and of available agents, only amlodipine has been shown not to adversely affect survival. In patients with both HF and angina pectoris, strong consideration should be given to the use of coronary revascularization, and coronary artery bypass surgery has been shown to lessen angina and reduce the risk of death in patients who have multivessel disease, reduced LVEF, and stable angina.

### Can β-blockers be used for people with COPD? [^115EVUsi]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2011). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a disabling condition characterised by largely irreversible airflow obstruction, and affects over 3 million people in the UK. Due in large part to shared risk factors — notably smoking — patients with COPD often also have cardiovascular diseases, such as ischaemic heart disease and heart failure. In these conditions, beta-blockers are valuable management options with proven benefits on symptoms and mortality. Historically, however, clinicians have been reluctant to prescribe beta-blockers for patients with co-existing COPD, due to fear of provoking bronchoconstriction. Moreover, such patients have typically been excluded from trials of beta-blockers, raising additional concerns about the basis for treating them with these drugs. However, withholding beta-blocker therapy might lead to suboptimal treatment for cardiovascular disease among these patients. Here we review the efficacy and safety of beta-blockers in patients with COPD.

### Guideline-directed medical therapy for heart failure does not exist: a non-judgmental framework for describing the level of adherence to evidence-based drug treatments for patients with a reduced ejection fraction [^115Wmqtv]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

Each of the criteria proposed in the table deserves thought and deliberation, particularly with respect to the use of beta‐blockers. Since not all beta‐blockers reduce mortality, the only members of the drug class that warrant inclusion in stratum I are those that have been specifically shown to reduce mortality in large‐scale trials. Furthermore, analyses of these trials have raised important questions about the ability of beta‐blockers to prolong survival in patients with atrial fibrillation, 48 potentially because the target doses used in the pivotal trials may have caused excessive slowing of the ventricular response, which predisposed to fatal bradyarrhythmic events. 49 Consequently, patients with atrial fibrillation who are treated with a beta‐blocker are assigned to stratum I with no designated target heart rate, since heart rates of 80–90 bpm may be appropriate targets for the use of beta‐blockers if patients have atrial fibrillation. 50

### Stable coronary artery disease: treatment [^111mzhJr]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Stable coronary artery disease refers to a reversible supply/demand mismatch related to ischemia, a history of myocardial infarction, or the presence of plaque documented by catheterization or computed tomography angiography. Patients are considered stable if they are asymptomatic or their symptoms are controlled by medications or revascularization. Treatment involves risk factor management, antiplatelet therapy, and antianginal medications. Tobacco cessation, exercise, and weight loss are the most important lifestyle modifications. Treatment of comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension should be optimized to reduce cardiovascular risk. All patients should be started on a statin unless contraindicated. No data support the routine use of monotherapy with nonstatin drugs such as bile acid sequestrants, niacin, ezetimibe, or fibrates. Studies of niacin and fibrates as adjunctive therapy found no improvement in patient outcomes. Aspirin is the mainstay of antiplatelet therapy; clopidogrel is an alternative. Antianginal medications should be added in a stepwise approach beginning with a beta blocker. Calcium channel blockers, nitrates, and ranolazine are used as adjunctive or second-line therapy when beta blockers are ineffective or contraindicated. Select patients may benefit from coronary revascularization with percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass grafting.

### Perioperative use of β-blockers in cardiac and noncardiac surgery [^111ag74m]. JAMA (2015). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

Are β-blockers associated with lower rates of mortality and morbidity after cardiac or noncardiac surgery?

Bottom Line

In cardiac surgery, β-blockers are associated with a lower incidence of supraventricular tachycardias (SVTs) and ventricular arrhythmias. In noncardiac surgery, β-blockers are associated with a possible increase in mortality and strokes, a lower incidence of acute myocardial infarctions (AMIs) and SVTs, and an increase in bradycardia and hypotension. If tolerated, long-term β-blocker treatment should be continued perioperatively, whereas the decision to start a β-blocker should be individualized, weighing risks and benefits.

### Individualized beta-blocker treatment for high blood pressure dictated by medical comorbidities: indications beyond the 2018 European Society of Cardiology / European Society of Hypertension guidelines [^116aczgM]. Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Several hypertension guidelines have removed beta-blockers from their previous position as first-choice drugs for the treatment of hypertension. However, this downgrading may not be justified by available evidence because beta-blockers lower blood pressure as effectively as other major antihypertensive drugs and have solid documentation in preventing cardiovascular complications. Suspected inconveniences of beta-blockers such as increased risk of depression or erectile dysfunction may have been overemphasized, while patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or peripheral artery disease, that is, conditions in which their use was previously restricted, will benefit from beta-blocker therapy. Besides, evidence that from early to late phases, hypertension is accompanied by activation of the sympathetic nervous system makes beta-blockers pathophysiologically an appropriate treatment in hypertension. Beta-blockers have favorable effects on a variety of clinical conditions that may coexist with hypertension, making their use either as specific treatment or as co-treatment potentially common in clinical practice. Guidelines typically limit recommendations on specific beta-blocker use to cardiac conditions including angina pectoris, postmyocardial infarction, or heart failure, with little or no mention of the additional cardiovascular or noncardiovascular conditions in which these drugs may be needed or preferred. In the present narrative review, we focus on multiple additional diseases and conditions that may occur and affect patients with hypertension, often more frequently than people without hypertension, and that may favor the choice of beta-blocker. Notwithstanding, beta-blockers represent an in-homogenous group of drugs and choosing beta-blockers with documented effect in prevention and treatment of disease is important for first choice in guidelines.

### Β-blockers and reduction of cardiac events in noncardiac surgery: clinical applications [^1176VH1b]. JAMA (2002). Excellent credibility.

Recent studies suggest that beta-blockers administered perioperatively may reduce the risk of adverse cardiac events and mortality in patients who have cardiac risk factors and undergo major noncardiac surgery. The objective of this article is to provide practicing physicians with examples of perioperative beta-blocker use in practice by using several hypothetical cases. Although current evidence describing the effectiveness of perioperative beta-blockade may not address all possible clinical situations, it is possible to formulate an evidence-based approach that will maximize benefit to patients. We describe how information from several sources can be used to guide management of patients with limited exercise tolerance, those at highest risk for perioperative cardiac events, patients who are taking beta-blockers long-term, and those with relative contraindications to beta-blockade. Even though fine points of their use remain to be elucidated, perioperative beta-blocker use is important and can be easily applied in practice by any physician involved with the care of patients perioperatively.

### 2022 AHA / ACC / HFSA guideline for the management of heart failure: executive summary: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^114o8xWv]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

Pre–heart failure (stage B) management to prevent clinical heart failure focuses on disease-modifying therapies and device prevention at specific left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) thresholds. In patients with LVEF ≤ 40%, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) should be used to prevent symptomatic HF and reduce mortality. In patients with a recent or remote history of myocardial infarction or acute coronary syndrome, statins should be used to prevent symptomatic HF and adverse cardiovascular events. In patients with a recent myocardial infarction and LVEF ≤ 40% who are intolerant to ACEI, angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) should be used to prevent symptomatic HF and reduce mortality. In patients with a recent or remote history of myocardial infarction or acute coronary syndrome and LVEF ≤ 40%, evidence-based beta blockers should be used to reduce mortality. In patients who are at least 40 days post–myocardial infarction with LVEF ≤ 30% and New York Heart Association (NYHA) class I symptoms while receiving GDMT and have reasonable expectation of meaningful survival for > 1 year, an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator is recommended for primary prevention of sudden cardiac death to reduce total mortality. In patients with LVEF ≤ 40%, beta blockers should be used to prevent symptomatic HF. In patients with LVEF < 50%, thiazolidinediones should not be used because they increase the risk of HF, including hospitalizations. In patients with LVEF < 50%, nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers with negative inotropic effects may be harmful.

American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology Guidelines: Long-Term Beta-Blocker Therapy for Post-Myocardial Infarction Prevention

This figure summarizes key updates in the AHA/ACC guidelines for beta-blocker use in secondary prevention after MI, from 2011 to 2023. It shows evolving recommendations, class of recommendation, and level of evidence, including various patient populations such as those with left ventricular dysfunction, heart failure, and CAD. The figure also highlights changes in treatment duration, patient selection, and specific beta-blocker medications. ACS = acute coronary syndrome; AHA/ACC = American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology; CAD = coronary artery disease; LVEF = left ventricular ejection fraction; MACE = major adverse cardiac events; MI = myocardial infarction; STEMI = ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction.

Beta-blocker therapy in the reperfusion era

The observed clinical benefits of beta-blocker therapy during the prereperfusion era are attributed to complex mechanisms of the beta-adrenoceptor blockade, including a reduction in myocardial work and thus myocardial oxygen consumption, reduced wall stress leading to less remodeling and anti-arrhythmic actions. However, its benefits appear less significant within the framework of modern practice. This is mainly due to the introduction of early reperfusion therapies with newer thrombolytic agents and invasive strategies, such as the percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in the late 1970s. The emergence of this reperfusion therapy increased rates of myocardial salvage and decreased ischemic times, leading to reduced mortality rates for MI patients. Furthermore, new progressive pharmacotherapies, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors facilitated the improvement of LVEF by mitigating ventricular remodeling, while statins enhanced survival by stabilizing atherosclerotic plaques and reducing the risk of recurrent CV events post-MI. In addition, these therapies have also enhanced patients' quality of life while avoiding the multiple side effects commonly associated with beta-blocker therapy.

Beta blockers — synopsis for CCD notes mechanisms, populations, and indications: Beta blockers exhibit their clinical effects by decreasing myocardial oxygen demand, improving ischemic threshold, and impeding maladaptive LV remodeling. Patients with CCD comprise patients with or without previous MI, LV systolic dysfunction, or both, and these distinctions should be considered in determining indications for beta‑blocker therapy. The strongest data for the benefit of beta‑blockers in CCD is for patients with LV systolic dysfunction, but benefit is less clear without LV dysfunction. Several ongoing RCTs aim to elucidate the need for and duration of beta‑blocker therapy for MACE reduction among post‑MI patients with preserved LV systolic function. Other primary indications may include angina, uncontrolled hypertension, or arrhythmias, and comprehensive screening is recommended because therapy may still be indicated for antianginal, antihypertensive, or negative chronotropic effects among patients with rhythm disturbance disorders.

2 METHODS

2.1 Study design and data collection

The study is a multicenter, prospective, cohort, observational registry project with clinicaltrials. gov identifier NCT04564365. We observed the Declaration of Helsinki guidelines. All study procedures were approved by the local ethics committee (approval number 2020‐607).

We enrolled patients hospitalized for AMI from five hospitals between April 2019 and April 2021. The baseline characteristics of the patients were collected through the medical record. The epidemiological data, risk factors, comorbidities, treatments, and prescribed medication information of the patients were recorded. During follow‐up, the information on patient survival status and hospitalization events was collected through telephone interviews and medical documents.

2.2 Population

Patients diagnosed with AMI from five hospitals were recruited consecutively from April 2019 to April 2021. This study initially enrolled 2218 patients with AMI. Patients with a history of HF (N = 46), AMI or reperfusion therapy (N = 107), patients with contraindications to beta‐blocker use (including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, peripheral vascular disease, second‐degree/third‐degree atrioventricular block, and sick sinus node syndrome, N = 94), patients with symptoms of HF at discharge (N = 93), patients without information on LVEF or with LVEF < 40% (N = 217), and patients died in hospital (N = 44) were excluded from the study. In addition, 32 patients died within 6 months and 102 patients lacked information on medication prescriptions or lost interviews, all of whom were also excluded. Ultimately, 1483 patients were included. This study included two groups, the continuous beta‐blocker therapy group (N = 1001) and the discontinuous beta‐blocker therapy group (N = 356, consisting of the no‐beta‐blocker therapy group and the beta‐blocker therapy < 6 months group; Figure 1).

### Beta-blocker use and COPD mortality: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117Kuxqw]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Beta-blockers are one of the most prescribed classes of cardiovascular medications. In clinical trials they have been shown to lower morbidity and mortality secondary to congestive heart failure (CHF) and coronary artery disease (CAD). Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a progressive debilitating lung disease and currently the third leading cause of death in North America. Many patients with COPD also have concomitant CAD. There has been uncertainty with regard to using beta-blockers in COPD patients mainly because of concerns that they might induce bronchospasm and worsen lung function, especially in those patients who have a combination of asthma and COPD.

Despite these concerns, there is emerging evidence that beta-blockers may be beneficial in patients with COPD. In one systematic review of 19 randomised controlled trials that included patients with both asthma and COPD, beta-blockers lowered FEV 1 by 7.46% (95% CI, 5.59%-9.32%). Results from this meta-analysis prompted guidelines to recommend the use of low dose beta-blockers in COPD patients.

Recent studies have also shown that beta-blockers may lower mortality in COPD patients. This potential benefit may arise from a possible protective effect of beta-blockers in patients with established CAD in whom these drugs may be underused. Beta-blockers may also be beneficial in patients with CAD and overlapping CHF. Finally, similar to statins, beta-blockers, especially cardio-selective beta-blockers such as carvedilol, may exert pleiotropic effects including antioxidant and alpha-adrenorecptor blocking properties. As of to date, no systematic review specifically addressing mortality benefit with beta-blockers in COPD patients has been conducted. We sought to address these questions with respect to a clinically important outcome mainly all cause mortality by undertaking a systematic review and meta-analysis.

### Beta-blocker underuse in secondary prevention of myocardial infarction [^1166iE8c]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the clinical benefits of beta-blockers as secondary prevention following a myocardial infarction (MI) and to address the reasons that clinicians are reluctant to use beta-blockers in specific patient populations.

Data Sources

MEDLINE was searched for articles published from January 1966 to October 2002. Relevant studies were identified by systematic searches of the literature for all reported studies of associations between beta-blocker underuse and secondary prevention of MI. Additional studies were identified by a hand search of references of original or review articles.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

English-language human studies were selected and analyzed.

Data Synthesis

Associations were observed in studies of beta-blocker use as secondary prevention of MI. A lower rate of beta-blocker treatment occurred in older patients and in patients with comorbid conditions such as diabetes, heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, and peripheral arterial disease. In addition, underuse was attributed to the perception of high rates of adverse events associated with beta-blockers. beta-Blocker use as secondary prevention of an MI can lead to a 19–48% decrease in mortality and up to a 28% decrease in reinfarction rates. Nonetheless, beta-blockers are significantly underused in many patient populations due to concomitant disease states. Due to their normal physiologic deterioration, the elderly are at an increased risk of low cardiac output and bradycardia when given a beta-blocker; therefore, they should be started on a low dose that is then slowly titrated. In diabetic patients, beta-blockers can impair glucose control leading to hypoglycemia; therefore, post-MI diabetic patients must routinely monitor their blood glucose levels. In patients with decompensated heart failure, beta-blocker use can lead to further cardiac depression, but lower oral starting doses with slow titration can reduce this risk. beta-Blockers can induce bronchospasm in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma, but cardioselective beta-blockers and appropriate use of medications such as albuterol can minimize these effects. Finally, in patients with peripheral arterial disease, with the exception of hypertensive patients with Reynaud's phenomenon, beta-blockers can be used safely. The only absolute contraindications to beta-blockers are severe bradycardia, preexisting sick sinus syndrome, second- and third-degree atrioventricular block, severe left ventricular dysfunction, active peripheral vascular disease with rest ischemia, or reactive airway disease so severe that airway support is required.

Conclusions

Overall, the cardiovascular benefits of beta-blockers as secondary prevention of MI significantly outweigh the risks associated with their use.

### Medical management of stable coronary artery disease [^115Li6ow]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

All patients with stable coronary artery disease require medical therapy to prevent disease progression and recurrent cardiovascular events. Three classes of medication are essential to therapy: lipid-lowering, antihypertensive, and antiplatelet agents. Lipid-lowering therapy is necessary to decrease low-density lipoprotein cholesterol to a target level of less than 100 mg per dL, and physicians should consider a goal of less than 70 mg per dL for very high-risk patients. Statins have demonstrated clear benefits in morbidity and mortality in the secondary prevention of coronary artery disease; other medications that can be used in addition to statins to lower cholesterol include ezetimibe, fibrates, and nicotinic acid. Blood pressure therapy for patients with coronary artery disease should start with beta blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. If these medications are not tolerated, calcium channel blockers or angiotensin receptor blockers are acceptable alternatives. Aspirin is the first-line antiplatelet agent except in patients who have recently had a myocardial infarction or undergone stent placement, in which case clopidogrel is recommended. Anginal symptoms of coronary artery disease can be treated with beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, nitrates, or any combination of these. Familiarity with these medications and with the evidence supporting their use is essential to reducing morbidity and mortality in patients with coronary artery disease.

### Acute coronary syndromes complicated by symptomatic and asymptomatic heart failure: does current treatment comply with guidelines? [^114bZfJW]. American Heart Journal (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) complicated by heart failure (HF) are at increased risk of death. Treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), beta-blockers, and early invasive risk stratification are recommended for these patients.

Aim

The purpose of the current study was to assess adherence to treatment guidelines of patients with ACS complicated by HF in Europe and the Mediterranean region.

Methods and Results

Of the 10,484 patients who participated in Euro-Heart ACS survey, 9587 had known HF status and were without cardiogenic shock; 7058 (74%) did not have symptomatic HF and 2529 (26%) presented with or developed symptomatic HF during hospitalization. HF patients were older and had more cardiovascular risk factors. ACEI were more commonly used in HF patients (75% vs 56%, P < .01), whereas beta-blockers were less frequently used (75% vs 82%, P < .01). Coronary angiography and in hospital revascularization rates were lower among HF patients (42% vs 57% for coronary angiography, P < .01, and 32% vs 42% for revascularization, P < .01). Similar trends were noticed among patients with left ventricular dysfunction (symptomatic and asymptomatic). Adjusted in-hospital mortality risk was higher among patients with ACS complicated by symptomatic HF regardless of electrocardiographic type of ACS: (ST-elevation ACS, OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.6–3.9; non-ST-elevation ACS, OR 8.9,95% CI 4.5–17.7; undetermined-ECG ACS, OR 9.3, 95% CI 2.5–34).

Conclusions

Patients with ACS complicated by HF were at increased risk of dying. A relatively high percentage of HF patients were treated with ACEI and beta-blockers in accordance with current recommendations. Rates of coronary angiography and revascularization were significantly lower in ACS patients with HF versus those without HF, which potentially contributed to their worse mortality

### Optimal preoperative assessment of the geriatric surgical patient: a best practices guideline from the American college of surgeons national surgical quality improvement program and the American Geriatrics Society [^111SQ4Ln]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2012). Medium credibility.

ACC/AHA guidelines for perioperative beta blockers — The guidelines support administration of beta blockers to patients who are already on beta blockers, particularly those with independent cardiac indications for these medications, and to patients undergoing intermediate risk or vascular surgery with known coronary artery disease or with multiple clinical risk factors for ischemic heart disease. If beta blockers are indicated, when feasible, they should be started at least days to weeks before elective surgery, titrated to a heart rate of 60–80 beats/minute in the absence of hypotension, and titrated rate control with beta blockers should continue during the intraoperative and postoperative periods. Beta blockers should be tapered off slowly to minimize risk of withdrawal. The current ACC/AHA guidelines state that routine administration of high-dose beta-blockers in the absence of dose titration is not useful and may be harmful to patients not currently taking beta-blockers who are undergoing noncardiac surgery.

MINOCA treatment — There are no completed RCTs evaluating the role of medical therapies to treat patients with MINOCA; management is largely empirical and consists of cardioprotective medications based on data extrapolated from patients with MI and obstructive CAD as well as etiologic-based therapies. Aspirin and statins are reasonable therapies for all patients with MINOCA who have any evidence of atherosclerotic plaque on coronary angiography or CCTA, and β-adrenergic blocking agents and ACEi or ARBs are indicated for patients with post-MI left ventricular dysfunction. Observationally, the largest retrospective analysis of 9466 patients with MINOCA demonstrated a lower mortality rate at a mean follow-up of 4.1 years with statins or β-blockers and a lower rate of a composite of all-cause mortality, hospitalization for MI, ischemic stroke, and HF with ACEi/ARB or statins.

Practical use of beta-blockers — risks of treatment: fluid retention and worsening HF indicates initiation of treatment has produced 4 types of adverse reactions, and initiation of therapy with a beta-blocker can cause fluid retention that is usually asymptomatic and is detected primarily by an increase in body weight but may become sufficiently marked to cause worsening symptoms of HF; physicians should ensure that patients are not volume overloaded before a beta-blocker is initiated, should monitor patients closely for increases in weight and for worsening signs and symptoms of HF, and should augment the dose of diuretic if weight increases whether or not other signs or symptoms of worsening HF are present; the occurrence of fluid retention or worsening HF is not generally a reason for the permanent withdrawal of treatment, as such patients generally respond favorably to intensification of conventional therapy and once treated remain excellent candidates for long-term treatment with a beta-blocker.

---

### Nadolol [^1164B5t4]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Cardiac Failure

Sympathetic stimulation may be a vital component supporting circulatory function in patients with congestive heart failure, and its inhibition by beta-blockade may precipitate more severe failure. Although beta-blockers should be avoided in overt congestive heart failure, if necessary, they can be used with caution in patients with a history of failure who are well-compensated, usually with digitalis and diuretics. Beta-adrenergic blocking agents do not abolish the inotropic action of digitalis on heart muscle.

IN PATIENTS WITHOUT A HISTORY OF HEART FAILURE, continued use of beta-blockers can, in some cases, lead to cardiac failure. Therefore, at the first sign or symptom of heart failure, the patient should be digitalized and/or treated with diuretics, and the response observed closely, or nadolol should be discontinued (gradually, if possible).

Exacerbation of Ischemic Heart Disease Following Abrupt Withdrawal -

Hypersensitivity to catecholamines has been observed in patients withdrawn from beta-blocker therapy; exacerbation of angina and, in some cases, myocardial infarction have occurred after abrupt discontinuation of such therapy. When discontinuing chronically administered nadolol, particularly in patients with ischemic heart disease, the dosage should be gradually reduced over a period of one to two weeks and the patient should be carefully monitored. If angina markedly worsens or acute coronary insufficiency develops, nadolol administration should be reinstituted promptly, at least temporarily, and other measures appropriate for the management of unstable angina should be taken. Patients should be warned against interruption or discontinuation of therapy without the physician's advice. Because coronary artery disease is common and may be unrecognized, it may be prudent not to discontinue nadolol therapy abruptly even in patients treated only for hypertension.

Nonallergic Bronchospasm (e.g., chronic bronchitis, emphysema)

PATIENTS WITH BRONCHOSPASTIC DISEASES SHOULD IN GENERAL NOT RECEIVE BETA-BLOCKERS. Nadolol should be administered with caution since it may block bronchodilation produced by endogenous or exogenous catecholamine stimulation of beta2receptors.

Major Surgery

Chronically administered beta-blocking therapy should not be routinely withdrawn prior to major surgery; however, the impaired ability of the heart to respond to reflex adrenergic stimuli may augment the risks of general anesthesia and surgical procedures.

### Beta-blocker therapy after myocardial Infarction [^112NUZCk]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Implications on guidelines

Current evidence on beta-blocker therapy, largely derived from observational studies, is conflicting, leading to variability in clinical guidelines. The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) recommends beta-blockers for patients with STEMI or NSTEMI and reduced LVEF (< 40%), and suggests long-term treatment for those with a history of prior MI, though without specifying duration. Its current guideline for ACS management recommends beta-blocker use in patients with LVEF ≤ 40% but does not distinguish between STEMI and NSTEMI or provide guidance on long-term therapy (Figure 2). Similarly, the current AHA/ACC guideline for chronic coronary disease management recommends beta-blocker therapy for patients with LVEF < 50% but advises reassessing the indication of treatment at 1-year post-MI for patients without reduced LVEF. They do not recommend long-term therapy for those with LVEF > 50%. The National Heart Foundation of Australia & Cardiac Society of Australia and New Zealand (NHFA/CSANZ) Guidelines for ACS management (Figure 3) recommends beta-blocker therapy for patients with LVEF < 40%, without differentiating between STEMI and NSTEMI, and lacks clear guidance for those with LVEF > 40%.

### Outpatient treatment of systolic heart failure [^11446MVy]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Optimal outpatient treatment of systolic heart failure has three goals that should be pursued simultaneously: (1) control of risk factors for the development and progression of heart failure, (2) treatment of heart failure, and (3) education of patients. Control of risk factors includes treating hypertension, diabetes, and coronary artery disease, and eliminating the use of alcohol and tobacco. All patients with heart failure should be taking an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin-receptor blocker. In the absence of contraindications, an ACE inhibitor is preferred. In most patients, physicians should consider adding a beta blocker to ACE-inhibitor therapy. In patients with severe heart failure, spironolactone is a useful addition to baseline drug therapy, as is carvedilol (substitute carvedilol if patient is already taking a beta blocker). Patients with stable heart failure should be encouraged to begin and maintain a regular aerobic exercise program. Digoxin therapy may reduce the likelihood of hospitalization but does not reduce mortality. It must be monitored closely, with a target dosage level of 0.5 to 1.1 ng per mL. Symptoms may be controlled with the use of diuretics and restricted dietary sodium. Finally, patient education, with the patient's active participation in the care, is a key strategy in the management of heart failure. Periodic follow-up between scheduled office visits, which is essential in the long-term management of heart failure, may include telephone calls from the office nurse, maintenance of a daily symptom and weight diary, and participation in a disease-management program.

Stage B (patients with pre-HF) — preventing clinical heart failure (HF) recommendations include: In patients with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 40%, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) should be used to prevent symptomatic HF and reduce mortality (Class 1, Level A). In patients with a recent or remote history of myocardial infarction (MI) or acute coronary syndrome (ACS), statins should be used to prevent symptomatic HF and adverse cardiovascular events (Class 1, Level A). In patients with a recent MI and LVEF ≤ 40% who are intolerant to ACEI, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) should be used to prevent symptomatic HF and reduce mortality (Class 1, Level B-R). In patients with a recent or remote history of MI or ACS and LVEF ≤ 40%, evidence-based beta blockers should be used to reduce mortality (Class 1, Level B-R). In patients who are at least 40 days post-MI with LVEF ≤ 30% and New York Heart Association (NYHA) class I symptoms while receiving guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) and have reasonable expectation of meaningful survival for > 1 year, an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) is recommended for primary prevention of sudden cardiac death (SCD) to reduce total mortality (Class 1, Level B-R). In patients with LVEF ≤ 40%, beta blockers should be used to prevent symptomatic HF (Class 1, Level C-LD). In patients with LVEF ≤ 50%, thiazolidinediones should not be used because they increase the risk of HF, including hospitalizations (Class 3: Harm, Level B-R). In patients with LVEF < 50%, nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers with negative inotropic effects may be harmful (Class 3: Harm, Level C-LD).

### 2022 AHA / ACC / HFSA guideline for the management of heart failure: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^115KtUYC]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

Asymptomatic low left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and post–myocardial infarction (MI) risk — key evidence and cautions are as follows: The Framingham studies have shown a 60% increased risk of death in patients with asymptomatic low LVEF compared with those with normal LVEF. MADIT-II showed a 31% relative risk reduction in all-cause mortality in patients with post-MI with LVEF ≤ 30% receiving a prophylactic ICD compared with standard of care. For prevention of progression, beta-blocker therapy is recommended to prevent symptomatic HF in patients with reduced LVEF. Regarding comorbid therapy, thiazolidinediones should be avoided in patients with reduced LVEF. Nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers diltiazem and verapamil are myocardial depressants and generally not tolerated in HF, and although not specifically tested in asymptomatic patients with low LVEF, nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers may be harmful in this population because of their negative inotropic effects.

### Beta-blocker use in the emergency department in patients with acute myocardial infarction undergoing primary angioplasty [^112S39vk]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Our objectives were to evaluate the frequency of beta-blocker administration in the setting of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) where angioplasty is the primary treatment, and to investigate emergency physician's (EPs) attitudes toward beta-blockers. We performed a retrospective chart review of all patients who presented with symptoms and electrocardiogram (EKG) criteria consistent with AMI in the defined study period. Charts were reviewed for beta-blocker administration and other treatments. A survey was subsequently distributed to all EPs to determine self-reported reasons for withholding beta-blockers. There were 91 patients identified. Of those who did not have contraindications, 99% (89/90) received aspirin, 97% (88/91) received heparin, 94% (84/89) received nitrates, but only 28% (19/68) received beta-blockers. Ninety-six percent of beta-blocker-eligible patients received them as inpatients. Eighty-six percent (44/52) of EPs completed the survey. Physicians felt strongly about avoiding beta-blockers in patients with asthma exacerbation, severe congestive heart failure, and high degree AV block. Bradycardia was the most frequent reason for withholding beta-blockers. In this series of patients presenting with AMI, beta-blockers were greatly underutilized. The self-reported reasons of EPs for withholding beta-blocker therapy did not explain why 72% (49/68) of patients without contraindications did not receive beta-blockers.
