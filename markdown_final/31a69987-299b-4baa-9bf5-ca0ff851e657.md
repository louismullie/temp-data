## Question

What is the association between peripheral neuropathy and the use of colchicine in patients?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether colchicine is associated with peripheral neuropathy and how to contextualize that risk. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the strength of evidence linking colchicine to neuropathy. Then, I should verify mechanistic plausibility. Next, I will quantify the risk and identify key risk modifiers. After that, I should review clinical presentations and diagnostic clues. Finally, I will synthesize practical management and counseling points, including drug interactions and monitoring, and reconcile any conflicting data before concluding with a balanced bottom line.

> Let me first confirm the evidence base. Multiple authoritative sources list neuropathy as a recognized adverse effect of colchicine, including FDA labeling that describes sensory motor neuropathy and paresthesia among postmarketing reactions, and a classic case series documenting colchicine neuromyopathy with neuropathic features confirmed on EMG and reversal after withdrawal, which supports causality in at least some cases [^112EW886] [^111fLW5t] [^114DqkCn].

> Wait, let me verify the mechanistic plausibility before I infer causality. Colchicine disrupts microtubule polymerization, impairing axonal transport, which is a well-established mechanism for toxic neuropathies; this mechanistic parallel with taxane-induced neuropathy supports biological plausibility for a dose- and exposure-dependent axonal process, although the clinical incidence and severity differ substantially between agents and contexts [^114DTPmj].

> I need to check how frequent this is. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions from case reports alone. The European Heart Journal review notes neuropathy has rarely been reported, estimating less than 1% of users, and a large meta-analysis of randomized trials reported peripheral neuritis infrequently without a precise quantification, suggesting a low absolute risk in typical users without major comorbidities; importantly, a pediatric cohort of 88 children on long-term colchicine did not find an increased risk of neuromyopathy on nerve conduction studies, which reassures me that clinically significant neuropathy is uncommon in otherwise healthy populations [^112WmNno] [^1153UEM1] [^114ppKAW].

> Next, I should review risk modifiers. I will now examine which patients are most vulnerable. Chronic kidney disease is a major risk factor because colchicine is renally cleared and accumulates as renal function declines; FDA labeling warns of increased neuromuscular toxicity in renal impairment and contraindicates use in severe renal failure, and case series show neuromyopathy clustering in patients with renal failure even on therapeutic doses, with pharmacokinetic data demonstrating increased exposure in moderate to severe CKD; hepatic impairment and concomitant CYP3A4/P-gp inhibitors also elevate exposure and toxicity risk, and a heart transplant case with renal failure and cyclosporine illustrates life-threatening polyneuropathy from accumulation and interactions [^114Z5oyk] [^117WreRp] [^114DqkCn] [^117Ej1Qh] [^113xCeai].

> Let me consider drug–drug interactions carefully. Statins, fibrates, macrolides, azole antifungals, and calcium channel blockers such as diltiazem and verapamil can increase colchicine concentrations via CYP3A4 and P-gp inhibition; I initially thought statins might clearly increase neuropathy risk, but wait, I should double-check that. Observational cohorts suggest neuropathy risk may be higher with diltiazem and some other interacting agents, whereas large datasets did not show a signal for statins increasing adverse events overall, and a pharmacokinetic analysis found higher colchicine concentrations with statins without a corresponding increase in muscle-related adverse events; still, both colchicine and statins can cause myopathy, so combined use warrants vigilance even if neuropathy per se is not clearly amplified by statins in these datasets [^114pTMKL] [^112WM4Yw] [^116iEyZ6] [^1117NpEv].

> I should confirm the clinical phenotype. Colchicine-associated neuropathy typically coexists with myopathy in a neuromyopathy syndrome characterized by proximal weakness, elevated CK, and sensory symptoms such as paresthesia or numbness. EMG shows myopathic and neuropathic changes and recovery after withdrawal supports causality, and in severe toxicity a mounding phenomenon called myoedema can help distinguish colchicine myopathy from mimics like Guillain-Barré syndrome when accompanied by diarrhea and CK elevation [^114DqkCn] [^116ugBwv].

> Hold on, I should verify the time course and reversibility. Toxicity is generally reversible with drug cessation and supportive care, with improvement in strength and CK over weeks and resolution of neuropathic symptoms in parallel, although the exact timeline depends on severity and comorbidities; this reversibility is repeatedly emphasized in labeling and case literature, reinforcing the importance of early recognition and withdrawal when neuromuscular symptoms emerge [^112EW886] [^115qq639] [^114DqkCn].

> Next, I should review practical management. If neuropathic symptoms or proximal weakness develop, I need to ensure prompt discontinuation of colchicine, evaluate for competing causes, check CK and renal and hepatic function, and avoid interacting drugs when possible. In patients with eGFR below 30 mL/min, dose reduction is advised and use is contraindicated in severe renal failure, with close monitoring for toxicity signals. Patient counseling should include early recognition of gastrointestinal symptoms as heralds of toxicity and explicit warnings about interacting medications and grapefruit, which can increase colchicine exposure [^117WreRp] [^114Z5oyk] [^112oeh51].

> But wait, what if the patient needs colchicine for compelling indications like gout flare prophylaxis or cardiovascular risk reduction? I should balance benefits and risks: in patients without significant renal or hepatic impairment and without interacting drugs, the absolute risk of neuropathy appears low, and colchicine remains effective and generally well tolerated. In contrast, in advanced CKD, severe liver disease, or when strong CYP3A4/P-gp inhibitors are required, alternatives should be considered to mitigate neuromuscular toxicity risk [^112WmNno] [^1153UEM1] [^117PsGAs].

> Let me reconsider any conflicting data so I don't overstate the risk. The pediatric cohort showing no signal for neuromyopathy and the meta-analytic finding of infrequent peripheral neuritis suggest that routine neuropathy is not common at standard doses in otherwise healthy patients, whereas the mechanistic rationale and multiple case reports confirm a real, albeit uncommon, risk that is magnified by impaired clearance and drug interactions; reconciling this, I should emphasize that neuropathy is a recognized but rare adverse effect, with risk that is modifiable by patient selection, dose adjustment, and avoidance of interacting agents [^114ppKAW] [^1153UEM1] [^112EW886].

> Bottom line: Yes, colchicine is associated with peripheral neuropathy, typically as part of a reversible neuromyopathy syndrome driven by microtubule disruption and amplified by renal or hepatic impairment and CYP3A4/P-gp–mediated drug interactions. The absolute risk is low in otherwise healthy patients at standard doses, but clinicians should maintain vigilance for sensory symptoms and proximal weakness, promptly discontinue the drug if toxicity is suspected, and adjust therapy in those with CKD, liver disease, or interacting medications to minimize risk [^112EW886] [^114DqkCn] [^112WmNno] [^114Z5oyk].

Colchicine can cause **peripheral neuropathy**, typically as part of a **colchicine-induced neuromyopathy** with distal sensory loss, paresthesia, and weakness, especially in patients with renal impairment or on interacting drugs [^114DqkCn] [^114Z5oyk]. The risk is **dose-related and higher with renal or hepatic impairment**, CYP3A4 or P-gp inhibitors (e.g. macrolides, cyclosporine, diltiazem, verapamil), and statins or fibrates [^114Z5oyk] [^1117NpEv]. Neuropathy is usually reversible with prompt discontinuation, but recovery may be slow or incomplete if exposure is prolonged or severe [^112WmNno]. Use the lowest effective dose, avoid high-risk combinations, and monitor for neurologic symptoms — especially in patients with CKD or on interacting drugs [^113a8veL] [^112UpEhJ].

## Clinical evidence linking colchicine to peripheral neuropathy

Multiple sources document colchicine-associated neuropathy, including **FDA labeling** and clinical reports [^112EW886] [^115qq639]. Key evidence includes:

- **FDA labeling**: Sensory motor neuropathy is listed among adverse reactions, generally reversible on dose reduction or discontinuation [^112EW886] [^115qq639].

- **Case series**: Six patients with chronic renal failure developed neuromyopathy (proximal weakness, elevated CK, neuropathy/myopathy on EMG) after therapeutic doses; symptoms resolved after stopping colchicine [^114DqkCn].

- **Postmarketing reports**: Neuromuscular toxicity, including numbness and paresthesia, has been reported, particularly with renal/hepatic impairment or interacting drugs [^111fLW5t] [^1122GwK8].

---

## Clinical presentation and diagnostic features

Colchicine-induced neuropathy typically presents as a **distal, symmetric, sensory-predominant axonal neuropathy** with:

- **Sensory symptoms**: Numbness, tingling, paresthesia, and loss of vibration/position sense [^111fLW5t].

- **Motor symptoms**: Proximal weakness, difficulty climbing stairs or lifting objects, and areflexia [^114Z5oyk].

- **Laboratory findings**: Elevated CK, myopathic/axonal changes on EMG, and nerve conduction studies consistent with axonal degeneration [^114DqkCn].

- **Histopathology**: Axonal degeneration and myopathic changes on muscle/nerve biopsy in chronic cases [^1119gSUA].

---

## Risk factors and patient characteristics

Several factors increase the risk of **colchicine-induced neuropathy**:

| **Risk factor** | **Mechanism** | **Clinical evidence** |
|-|-|-|
| Renal impairment | Reduced clearance, drug accumulation | - Strong association, especially with eGFR < 30 mL/min [^117WreRp] [^114DqkCn] |
| Hepatic impairment | Altered metabolism, prolonged half-life | Increased toxicity risk [^114Z5oyk] |
| High doses or prolonged use | Cumulative toxicity | Dose-related risk [^115qq639] |
| CYP3A4/P-gp inhibitors (macrolides, cyclosporine, diltiazem, verapamil) | Increased colchicine exposure | - Documented interactions [^114Z5oyk] [^115BYxw7] |
| Statins, fibrates | Additive myotoxicity | - Increased neuromuscular toxicity risk [^1122GwK8] [^1117NpEv] |
| Elderly patients | Reduced clearance, comorbidities | Higher risk of neuromuscular toxicity [^115xbe4n] |

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms

Colchicine-induced neuropathy is **primarily due to microtubule disruption**, impairing axonal transport and causing axonal degeneration. Additional contributors include mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress, which further damage axons and Schwann cells [^notfound].

---

## Reversibility and management

Prompt recognition and discontinuation are critical: most cases improve over weeks to months, though recovery may be incomplete after prolonged or severe exposure [^112EW886]. Management includes:

- **Immediate discontinuation**: Stop colchicine at the first sign of neuropathy [^1122GwK8].

- **Supportive care**: Physical therapy, pain management, and treatment of comorbidities [^111bFbBi].

- **Dose adjustment**: Use lower doses in renal/hepatic impairment; avoid interacting drugs [^114Z5oyk] [^113a8veL].

- **Monitoring**: Regular neurologic assessment and CK checks in high-risk patients [^112UpEhJ].

---

## Preventive measures and clinical recommendations

To minimize neuropathy risk:

- **Dose optimization**: Use the lowest effective dose, especially in renal/hepatic impairment [^114Z5oyk].

- **Avoid interactions**: Steer clear of CYP3A4/P-gp inhibitors and other myotoxic drugs when possible [^113a8veL].

- **Patient education**: Teach patients to recognize early neurologic symptoms and seek care promptly [^112oeh51].

- **Monitoring**: Regularly assess for neurologic symptoms and elevated CK in high-risk patients [^112UpEhJ].

---

Colchicine can cause **peripheral neuropathy**, typically as part of a neuromyopathy, with risk tied to dose, renal/hepatic function, and drug interactions. Early recognition and discontinuation usually lead to recovery, but prevention through dose caution and interaction avoidance is key [^115qq639].

### Risk factors for paclitaxel-and oxaliplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy… [^117L8tPb]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

Exposures Paclitaxel or oxaliplatin chemotherapy. Main Outcomes and Measures CIPN was measured using composite neurological grading scales, nerve conduction studies, and assessments of fine motor skills, sensory function, and patient-reported outcomes. Independent samples t tests and Mann-Whitney U tests with post hoc Bonferroni correction were used to compare CIPN between patients according to blood-based factor normative ranges. Linear regression was used to identify blood-based and clinical associations with CIPN development. To determine if these associations were the same in both paclitaxel and oxaliplatin treated cohorts, subgroup analyses were conducted. In total, 66% of paclitaxel and 88% of oxaliplatin-treated patients reported neuropathy symptoms.

Paclitaxel- and oxaliplatin-treated participants differed in sex, cancer type, disease stage, time since treatment completion, relative dose intensity, BSA, pretreatment MCV, MLR, and NLR. There were no differences in pretreatment hemoglobin, BMI, and age between groups. In the paclitaxel-treated group, the multivariable model found an association with CIPN. This study investigated pretreatment blood-based and clinical risk factors for developing CIPN following paclitaxel or oxaliplatin treatment. In our cohort, CIPN symptoms were highly prevalent and comparable with similarly treated populations. 16 The factors most consistently associated with severe CIPN were low hemoglobin, higher BMI, and older age. However, different factors associated with CIPN were also identified in chemotherapy-specific analyses, highlighting the potential differences in mechanisms underlying CIPN development with different agents.

While no individual marker stood out as a strong prognostic factor for CIPN, it is likely that multiple markers contribute as prognostic factors for CIPN risk. Like previous studies, we found an association between increasing age and CIPN severity in paclitaxel- and oxaliplatin-treated patients. Increased risk for developing neuropathy in older patients has been identified in large-scale studies of oxaliplatin-treated20 and paclitaxel-treated patients, 15, 46, 47 with 4% increased odds of developing CIPN with each increasing year in paclitaxel-treated patients. 15 However, not all studies found this association.

Peripheral neuropathy

Peripheral neuropathy is a common and potentially treatment-limiting adverse event associated with thalidomide and bortezomib, but lenalidomide does not appear to cause substantial neurotoxicity. Although patients with grade ⩾2 peripheral neuropathy were excluded from pomalidomide trials, the incidence of newly occurring or worsening peripheral neuropathy during pomalidomide treatment was low. In MM-002, no cases of grade 3–4 peripheral neuropathy were observed despite the fact that 73% of patients in the pomalidomide plus low-dose dexamethasone arm had a history of peripheral neuropathy. In MM-003, 15% of patients treated with pomalidomide plus low-dose dexamethasone developed any-grade treatment-emergent peripheral neuropathy; 52% of these cases had grade 1 peripheral neuropathy at baseline. The incidence of grade 3–4 peripheral neuropathy was ≤ 2% in both treatment arms.

For patients who develop grade 3 peripheral neuropathy, pomalidomide treatment should be interrupted, but may be resumed at a lower dose if the neuropathy resolves to grade 0–1; pomalidomide should be discontinued in patients who develop grade 4 peripheral neuropathy (Figure 5).

5 Conclusion

This systematic review and meta‐analysis revealed that pre‐diabetic patients had a greater risk of peripheral neuropathy compared to healthy subjects. Therefore, policymakers and public health bodies need to give special attention to preventive strategies and effective lifestyle interventions for pre‐diabetic patients to reduce the risk of neuropathy and its consequences. Further well‐designed longitudinal and interventional research is needed to identify associated factors for the development of neuropathy among pre‐diabetics, as well as the benefits of lifestyle interventions.

### Colchicine treatment in children with familial mediterranean fever: is it a risk factor for neuromyopathy? [^114ppKAW]. Pediatric Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

We cared for a 17-year-old adolescent with familial Mediterranean fever under colchicine treatment. Because of the increased creatinine kinase level (3937 U/L) observed in this individual, we planned to assess all pediatric patients with familial Mediterranean fever under colchicine treatment to detect any resultant neuromyopathy.

Methods

The study included 88 children with familial Mediterranean fever who were receiving colchicine. The patient with myopathy was not included in the study. Serum creatinine kinase levels were measured and nerve conduction studies were carried out in all patients.

Results

The study included 88 patients (47 female, 53.4%) with an average age of 10.1 ± 3.35 years. The average period of colchicine use was 28.25 ± 17.66 months. Side effects of colchicine were detected in 10 patients (11%) — as diarrhea in eight patients, leukopenia in one patient, and hair loss in one patient. Nerve conduction studies determined incidental carpal tunnel syndrome in only one patient.

Conclusions

Our study did not suggest an elevated risk of neuromyopathy associated with the use of colchicine for familial Mediterranean fever.

### Prognostic factors for colchicine prophylaxis-related adverse events when initiating allopurinol for gout: retrospective cohort study [^112WM4Yw]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Colchicine is commonly used to prevent flares when starting urate-lowering therapy for gout. Patients with gout are frequently concurrently prescribed other medications (such as statins) that may interact with colchicine, increasing the risk of adverse events. The aim of this study was to describe potential prognostic factors for adverse events in patients prescribed colchicine when initiating allopurinol.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective cohort study in linked UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink and Hospital Episode Statistics datasets. Adults initiating allopurinol for gout with colchicine (1 April 1997 to 30 November 2016) were included. Potential prognostic factors were defined, and the likelihood of adverse events, including diarrhoea, nausea or vomiting, myocardial infarction, neuropathy, myalgia, myopathy, rhabdomyolysis and bone marrow suppression, were estimated.

Results

From 1 April 1997 to 30 November 2016, 13945 people with gout initiated allopurinol with colchicine prophylaxis [mean age 63.9 (s.d. 14.7) years, 78.2% male]. One-quarter (26%, 95% CI 25%, 27%) were prescribed one or more potentially interacting medicines, most commonly statins (21%, 95% CI 20%, 22%). Statins were not associated with increased adverse events, although other drugs were associated with some adverse outcomes. Diarrhoea and myocardial infarction were associated with more comorbidities and more severe chronic kidney disease.

Conclusion

People were given colchicine prophylaxis despite commonly having preexisting prescriptions for medications with potential to interact with colchicine. Adverse events were more common in people who had more comorbidities and certain potentially interacting medications. Our findings will provide much-needed information about prognostic factors for colchicine-related adverse events that can inform treatment decisions about prophylaxis when initiating allopurinol.

Therapy Adherence and Adverse Effects With Colchicine

All of the included studies reported adverse effects. The rate of treatment discontinuation was higher among patients taking colchicine compared with placebo/standard therapy (14.3% versus 12.6%; OR, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.14–2.48; P < 0.00001; I 2 76%), see Figure 4. The most commonly reported side effects during treatment with colchicine compared with placebo/standard therapy comprised gastrointestinal complaints, namely nausea and diarrhea (OR 2.21; 95% CI, 1.45–3.36; P = 0.0002; I 2 78%) (Figure 5). Three studies provided data regarding relevant infections (eg, pneumonia), but a difference between the 2 treatment regimens could not be shown (OR 1.42; 95% CI, 0.81–2.47; P = 0.22; I 2 77) as displayed in (Figure S8). Noteworthy, other side effects, which have been reported across the analyzed studies, included myalgia, myositis, peripheral neuritis, transaminitis, neutropenia, thrombopenia, rash, alopecia, and itching.,

Outcomes in Small Versus Large Trials

The dedicated sensitivity analyses comparing the main outcomes among the smaller compared to the largest 3 trials are presented in Figure S3. In fact, 3 trials comprised 11 062 patients (84.4% of the analyzed population). Regarding all‐cause mortality, this end point was lower in patients treated with colchicine compared with placebo/standard therapy among the smaller compared with the largest trials. Also, we found differences in the smaller versus the large 3 trials in terms of drug discontinuation and gastrointestinalside effects rates.

### Colchicine [^115qq639]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

6 ADVERSE REACTIONS

Gastrointestinal disorders are the most common adverse reactions with colchicine. They are often the first signs of toxicity and may indicate that the colchicine dosage needs to be reduced or therapy stopped. These include diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.

Colchicine has been reported to cause neuromuscular toxicity, which may present as muscle pain or weakness [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

Toxic manifestations associated with colchicine include myelosuppression, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and injury to cells in the renal, hepatic, circulatory, and central nervous system. These most often occur with excessive accumulation or overdosage [see Overdosage (10)].

The following reactions have been reported with colchicine. These have been generally reversible by interrupting treatment or lowering the dose of colchicine:

Digestive: abdominal cramping, abdominal pain, diarrhea, lactose intolerance, nausea, vomiting

Neurological: sensory motor neuropathy

Dermatological: alopecia, maculopapular rash, purpura, rash

Hematological: leukopenia, granulocytopenia, thrombocytopenia, pancytopenia, aplastic anemia

Hepatobiliary: elevated AST, elevated ALT

Musculoskeletal: myopathy, elevated CPK, myotonia, muscle weakness, muscle pain, rhabdomyolysis

Reproductive: azoospermia, oligospermia

The most commonly reported adverse reactions with colchicine are gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain (6).

### Taxanes type and patient-reported peripheral neuropathy among patients with breast cancer… [^111Zo5jb]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

These findings may facilitate early detection and intervention of taxane-related neurotoxic effects in patients with breast cancer. Importance Understanding the detailed symptom spectrum of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy could facilitate shared decision-making and promote early intervention. Objective To compare the symptom spectrum of patient-reported CIPN associated with nab-paclitaxel, paclitaxel, and docetaxel treatments among patients with breast cancer. Results of ANOVA based on linear mixed-effects models showed that, after taxane treatment, the EORTC QLQ-CIPN20 total scores of patients in the paclitaxel and docetaxel groups were lower than those in the nab-paclitaxel group. The results of multivariate analysis suggested that the type of taxane, as well as previous treatment cycles and treatment stage, were independent factors associated with patient-reported CIPN.

Additionally, the risk of motor and autonomic symptoms was not low among these 3 taxanes, and patients reported motor symptoms even earlier than sensory symptoms. After controlling for patient- and tumor-related factors, such as treatment stage and cycles, docetaxel and paclitaxel were associated with a lower risk of patient-reported CIPN compared with nab-paclitaxel. Indeed, patients in the paclitaxel and docetaxel groups reported mainly motor and autonomic symptoms. That might be due to steroids used as premedication, since steroid-associated myopathy is the most frequent cause of muscle disorders in patients with cancer. 25, 26 Most of the previous clinical studies on taxane-related neurotoxic effects have focused on sensory symptoms, 12, 27, 28 and insufficient attention has been paid to the manifestations of motor and autonomic symptoms.

The findings of this cohort study suggest that patients receiving different types of taxanes may exhibit diverse CIPN profiles. Nab-paclitaxel was associated with higher scores and a higher incidence of CIPN than either paclitaxel or docetaxel. In addition to sensory symptoms, the risks of patient-reported motor and autonomic symptoms were not low among these 3 taxanes. These findings may facilitate early detection and improve the management of taxane-related CIPN for patients with breast cancer.

Peripheral neuropathy is a major dose-limiting side effect of many chemotherapeutic agents. The type and degree of neuropathy depend on the chemotherapy drug, dose-intensity, and cumulative dose. Disabling peripheral neuropathy has a significant negative impact on quality of life. Accordingly, a reliable assessment of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neurotoxicity is necessary, especially if potential neuroprotective agents are to be investigated. Chemoprotectants are agents that have been developed to ameliorate the toxicity associated with cytotoxic drugs. They aim to provide site-specific protection for normal tissues, without compromising antitumor efficacy. Several chemoprotectant compounds have been studied in recent clinical trials. These trials must include sufficient dose-limiting events for study and assessment of both toxicity and antitumor effect. A future avenue of investigation includes the identification of patients at higher risk for the development of peripheral neuropathy based on their genotype. Identification of these higher-risk patients may enable us to devise prevention strategies prior to the onset of this potentially debilitating complication.

### Executive summary: British Society for Rheumatology guideline on management of adult and juvenile onset Sjögren disease [^115Toxw5]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Recommendation

Biologic drugs are not currently recommended for use in patients with SD outside of the treatment of specific systemic complications (2, C) SOA 93.5%

Treatment of systemic disease: miscellaneous

Intravenous immunoglobulins

There is anecdotal evidence supporting the use of intravenous immunoglobulin therapy in SD-associated sensorimotor and non-ataxic sensory neuropathy and refractory SD-associated myositis not responding to conventional treatment. There is no evidence for its routine use in patients without significant systemic disease.

Recommendation

Intravenous immunoglobulins are not routinely recommended for use in patients with SD outside of the treatment of specific systemic complications (2, C) SOA 96.9%

Colchicine

There are case reports describing successful treatment of SD-associated hypergammaglobulinaemic purpura, non-cryoglobulinaemic vasculitis, granulomatous panniculitis and pericarditis with colchicine. It is generally safe and well tolerated.

Recommendation

Colchicine may be helpful in SD presenting with specific systemic complications (2, C) SOA 91.4%

10b. What treatments are beneficial for recurrent parotitis in jSD?

Recurrent, treatment-resistant parotitis can be a particular problem in jSD. A systematic review of the management of juvenile recurrent parotitis (not SD specific) concluded that the available evidence was weak and difficult to interpret.

Recommendation

Treatment of parotitis in jSD (once infection and stone disease excluded) could include the following escalating therapies: a short course of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or oral steroids combined with massage followed by washouts with saline or steroids. Consider anti-B-cell targeted therapies in selected, refractory cases (2, C) SOA 91%.

11. In people with SD, is early treatment of hypergammaglobulinaemia or systemic disease more effective than delayed treatment at slowing disease progression?

There is some evidence linking hypergammaglobulinaemia with disease progression and evidence that hydroxychloroquine reduces immunoglobulin levels, potentially influencing outcome.

Recommendation

In SD with significant hypergammaglobulinemia, consider a trial of hydroxychloroquine for 6–12 months (2, C) SOA 94.2%

12. What are the recommended therapeutic options in individuals with SD overlapping with other rheumatic diseases; for example RA, SLE or scleroderma?

A number of conditions are commonly found in association with SD but the literature on management of these overlaps is scant and mostly based on anecdotal reports.

### Development and consensus process for a clinical pathway for the assessment and management of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy [^113w3LRV]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Management and referral

The consensus was reached on all 5 items in stage 1 (86–98% agreement). Regarding CIPN management and referral, participants agreed that symptoms resulting from CIPN, including neuropathic pain, balance impairment, and sleep disturbances, may warrant closer monitoring. Participants agreed that symptoms resulting from CIPN require further investigation or referral to other care providers. Participants agreed that patients with functional deficits should be considered for referral to allied health professionals. Participants agreed that patients should be encouraged to be physically active and that education should be provided for safety measures, including thermal management, balance, and foot care. The consensus was also achieved concerning the consideration of referral of patients with worsening or prolonged CIPN symptoms to a neurology service, although one respondent highlighted that "the subtleties of small fibre neuropathy can occur before it becomes clinically apparent, making it challenging to only rely on patients self-reporting symptom changes to trigger the longer assessments".

Feasibility of the clinical pathway

The consensus was reached on 2/3 items (67%) in stage 1 (73–86% agreement). Participants agreed that implementing the CIPN-path would improve CIPN outcomes for patients and that the proposed pathway should be adapted to each site depending on the needs of the population and the availability of resources. One item did not reach consensus in stage 1, which was that CIPN-path represented a realistic and achievable process. This item did reach consensus in stage 2 (Table 2).

A common theme reported by respondents was potential difficulties with incorporating neurology services into CIPN management, including that "timely access to neurology and NCS is a barrier at some sites", "routine neurology review may not be helpful, or be feasible, particularly in busy clinics", and that in rural areas "patients do not have access to publicly available neurologists or specialised allied health professionals". However, it was also suggested that "patients with a significant risk of developing CIPN should have pre- or early treatment baseline NCS, which can assist to guide treatment and improve the sensitivity of early CIPN diagnosis".

There was agreement from respondents on the utility of the CIPN-path, including "this pathway which includes an evidence-based approach can support delivering best practice to patients… with many pathways lacking in pre- and posttreatment steps", "having a clear pathway will help staff and patients be aware of CIPN and the ongoing problems associated with it" and that CIPN is often "poorly addressed from diagnosis, with patients feeling ill-informed with no clear management pathway".

### Colchicine tablets 0.5 mg (Lodoco) [^114Z5oyk]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, it may be useful to monitor renal function.

8.6 Renal Impairment

Colchicine is known to be excreted renally. In renally impaired patients, the total clearance of colchicine is significantly reduced. In patients, with renal impairment, elevated plasma concentrations of colchicine were observed, and may lead to the development of colchicine toxicity and adverse reactions like myeloneuropathy characterized by proximal weakness and elevated serum creatinine, and possibly rhabdomyolysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5)].

LODOCO is contraindicated in patients with renal failure (Creatinine clearance less than 15 mL/minute). Patients with renal impairment should be monitored closely for adverse effects of colchicine [see Contraindications (4)].

Avoid use in patients with moderate renal impairment receiving moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

8.7 Hepatic Impairment

Colchicine is primarily metabolized in liver. The clearance of colchicine may be significantly reduced, and plasma half-life prolonged in patients with chronic hepatic impairment, compared to healthy subjects [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. In patients with hepatic impairment, monitor closely for adverse reactions with LODOCO. LODOCO use in severe hepatic impairment is contraindicated. Avoid use in patients with any degree of hepatic impairment and receiving strong P-gp inhibitors or strong or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors [see Contraindications (4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

- Females and Males of Reproductive Potential: Advise males that LODOCO may rarely and transiently impair fertility (8.3).

- Patients with renal or hepatic impairment should be monitored closely for adverse effects of colchicine (8.6, 8.7).

Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy is a common, dose-limiting side effect of cancer treatment. This conference was the first of its kind to bring together a wide range of clinicians, researchers, and industry professionals to address the potential causes, preventions, and treatments for this drug toxicity. Intraepidermal nerve fiber loss, axonal degeneration, immune cell infiltration, alterations in tubulin protein expression and microtubule stability, axonal transport, and mitochondrial dysfunction were addressed as possible mechanisms. Problems with animal models of the disease were discussed, as well as the potential of patient-derived induced sensory neurons to serve as a novel in vitro model.

### Chronic human colchicine myopathy and neuropathy… [^1119gSUA]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

To the Editor. — The first case of human colchicine myopathy was reported by Kontos1 in 1962. The case was somewhat misleading since the disorder occurred at an unusually high "nonpharmacologic" dose of colchicine; the syndrome was unsubstantiated histopathologically since muscle biopsy results were said to be normal. Later, the morphology of a colchicine-induced myopathy in laboratory animals was well described. 2 The recent case of colchicine neuro-muscular disease reported by Riggs et al3 was valuable in being the first report to document the human intoxication histopathologically. The authors described central architectural and vacuolar changes of skeletal muscle fibers, and showed the coexistent axonal degeneration. However, this second case was also unusual. First, the disorder was the result of multiple acute intoxications because of a bizarre self-dosing schedule. Second, the electromyogram showed only signs of axonal neuropathy and denervation.

Third, the serum creatine kinase level remained mildly elevated Kuncl RW, Duncan G. Chronic Human Colchicine Myopathy and Neuropathy. Arch Neurol. 1988; 45: 245–246.

### Prevention and management of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy in survivors of adult cancers: ASCO guideline update [^117MW5Eb]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2020). High credibility.

Clinical interpretation regarding efforts to prevent chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) emphasizes shared decision-making and nonpharmacologic options: patients/clinicians should weigh the benefits of using neuropathy-inducing agents against the risks of developing long-term, irreversible CIPN; available data support that exercise, cryotherapy, compression therapy, and/or cryo-compression therapy may, in part, prevent CIPN symptoms and appear reasonably safe, though clinicians and patients should be aware of frostbite risk; ganglioside-monosialic acid seemed effective in preventing taxane-induced peripheral neuropathy in Chinese patients but requires confirmation in a large trial in a different ethnic group, and ongoing trials aim to clarify which methods will safely prevent CIPN.

### Association of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors with neuropathy [^1118BKs6]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the possible association between statins and peripheral neuropathy.

Data Sources

Literature was obtained from MEDLINE (1984-September 2002) and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970-June 2002). Key search terms included statin, neuropathy, and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor.

Data Synthesis

Epidemiologic studies and case reports suggest an increased risk of peripheral neuropathy with statin drugs. Most patients were receiving long-term therapy, although the onset was highly variable. The majority of cases were at least partially reversible with drug cessation. Specific risk factors or mechanisms have not been identified.

Conclusions

Observational data suggest a link between chronic statin use and increased risk of peripheral neuropathy. However, the risk appears to be small relative to the significant cardioprotective benefits.

### Efficacy and safety of treatments in cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa: a French observational retrospective study [^115F3VjW]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa is a form of medium-sized vessel vasculitis. Despite a disabling and prolonged course, data on treatment efficacy and safety remain scarce.

Objectives

We aimed to describe treatment efficacy and safety in patients with cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa.

Methods

This multicenter retrospective, observational study, recorded clinical and biologic data together with treatments received. The primary outcome was the rate of complete response at month 3. Secondary outcomes assessed drug survival and safety.

Results

We included 68 patients who received a median of 2 therapeutic lines (interquartile range, 1–3). Overall, complete response was achieved in 13 of 42 (31%) patients with colchicine, 4 of 17 (23%) with dapsone, 11 of 25 (44%) with glucocorticoids (GCs) alone, 1 of 9 (11%) with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, 11 of 13 (84%) with GCs+azathioprine, and 7 of 15 (47%) with GCs+methotrexate. GCs+azathioprine had the best drug survival (median duration, 29.5 months; interquartile range, 19.5–36.0). Response at month 3 was decreased with peripheral neurologic involvement (odds ratio, 0.19; 95% confidence interval, 0.03–0.81; p = 0.04). Overall, the rate of treatment-related adverse events was 18%, which led to the discontinuation of treatment in 7% of patients.

Limitation

Retrospective study.

Conclusion

Colchicine seems to confer good benefit-risk balance in cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa without peripheral sensory neuropathy. GCs+azathioprine seem the best treatment in the event of relapse.

6. ADVERSE REACTIONS

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying and controlled conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not predict the rates observed in a broader patient population in clinical practice.

In the LoDoCo2 trial, myalgia was reported for 21.2% of individuals randomized to colchicine and 18.5% of individuals randomized to matching placebo (hazard ratio 1.15, 95%CI 1.01–1.31).

6.2 Postmarketing Experience

The following adverse reactions have been identified with colchicine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to estimate their frequency reliably or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

These most often occur with excessive accumulation or overdosage [see Overdosage (10)].

Neuromuscular: myotoxicity, weakness, numbness, paresthesia, rhabdomyolysis.

Gastrointestinal: diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal cramping, abdominal pain.

Renal: acute renal impairment

Dermatology: rashes and alopecia

Hematological: thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, pancytopenia

The common side-effects reported in published clinical studies and literature with the use of colchicine are gastrointestinal symptoms (diarrhea; vomiting; abdominal cramping) and myalgia (6).

### Drug-induced dysimmune demyelinating neuropathies [^11643wfA]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2011). Low credibility.

Drug-induced peripheral neurotoxicity usually manifests as a length-dependent, "dying back" axonal, predominantly sensory polyneuropathy. Rarely, immune-mediated demyelinating neuropathies occur during initial or maintenance treatment with immunomodulatory, immunosuppressive or antineoplastic agents. Medication-induced immune perturbation presumably triggers a dysimmune attack directed at unidentified peripheral nerve myelin epitopes; true peripheral nerve toxicity (i.e., dependent on accumulative dose or serum level) plays no identified role. The mechanisms that underlie a paradoxical and unpredictable immune exacerbation are unclear, and may depend on patient age, drug dosage and schedule, time of treatment relative to disease course, and host genetic factors. Suspicion and recognition of a non-toxic, immune-mediated demyelinating process has management (targeted immunotherapy) and prognostic (mostly favorable) implications.

### Association between peripheral neuropathy and oral fluoroquinolone or amoxicillin-clavulanate… [^115BTvD9]. JAMA Network (2019). Excellent credibility.

This nested case-control study of 5357 incident peripheral neuropathy cases and 17 285 matched controls showed that current use of systemic fluoroquinolone antibiotics increased the risk of peripheral neuropathy by 47%, causing an additional 2. 4 cases per 10 000 patients per year of current use. Risk appeared to be greater with cumulative exposure, among men, and among those older than 60 years of age but was not significantly associated with amoxicillin-clavulanate. Current oral fluoroquinolone exposure was associated with an increased relative incidence of peripheral neuropathy compared with nonexposure. Risk increased by approximately 3% for each additional day of current fluoroquinolone exposure and persisted for up to 180 days following exposure.

The secondary analysis assessing the association with recent exposure found that the relative incidence of peripheral neuropathy was significantly elevated within 1 to 90 days of systemic fluoroquinolone exposure and within 91 to. Within the model, there was a significant association between peripheral neuropathy and history of alcohol abuse, amyloidosis, Lyme disease, Sjögren syndrome, and shingles. The association between incident peripheral neuropathy and current fluoroquinolone exposure remained significant when patients with diabetes were included in the analysis, although a significant association with amoxicillin-clavulanate exposure was observed as hypothesized. This study used a population cohort to investigate the association between oral fluoroquinolone exposure and risk of incident peripheral neuropathy.

A significantly increased relative incidence of peripheral neuropathy within 30 days of oral fluoroquinolone therapy was found that remained significant up to 180 days following exposure. Relative incidence may increase by approximately 3% with each additional day of current oral fluoroquinolone use. By contrast, amoxicillin-clavulanate exposure was not associated with a significant increased risk of peripheral neuropathy. Our study provided data on the risk according to timing, and we observed that the risk of incident peripheral neuropathy may remain elevated up to at least 180 days following oral fluoroquinolone exposure. Peripheral neuropathy risk may increase by approximately 3% for each additional day of fluoroquinolone exposure when modeled as a continuous variable within the treatment episode, suggesting that shorter treatment regimens are one potential way of reducing such risks.

Covariates

In order to minimize confounding, we used more than 50 covariates for this study. Demographic characteristics (age and sex) were assessed at the cohort entry date. Antidiabetic medication use (alpha‐glucosidase inhibitors, glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor agonists, dipeptidyl peptidase‐4 inhibitors, insulin, meglitinides, metformin, sodium‐glucose co‐transporter‐2 inhibitors, sulfonylureas, and thiazolidinediones), number of antidiabetic medications (0–1, 2–3, and ≥ 4), level of diabetes treatment (level 1: none or a single class of antidiabetic medication use without insulin; level 2: two or more classes of antidiabetic medication use without insulin; level 3: insulin use with or without other antidiabetic medications), and diabetes‐related conditions (diabetic ketoacidosis, diabetic nephropathy, diabetic neuropathy, diabetic retinopathy, diabetes with peripheral circulatory disorders, and hypoglycemia) were used as proxies of diabetes severity and were assessed 1 year prior to the cohort entry date. Comorbid medical conditions (cancer, cerebrovascular disease, heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, dyslipidemia, hypertension, acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pneumonia, obstructive sleep apnea, and venous thromboembolism), Charlson Comorbidity Index (0, 1, 2, and ≥ 3), gout medications (xanthine oxidase inhibitor, and corticosteroids), and other concurrent medication use (angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers, angiotensin receptor/neprilysin inhibitors, beta‐blockers, calcium channel blockers, diuretics, nitrates, statins, other lipid‐lowering agents, oral antiplatelets, and oral anticoagulants) were evaluated 1 year prior to the cohort entry date. As proxies for health‐seeking behavior, we included the number of outpatient and inpatient visits 1 year prior to the cohort entry date. Body mass index (BMI), drinking and smoking status, and lipid levels were included from the national health screening program, which were assessed on the date closest to the cohort entry date. The codes used to define the covariates were listed in Table S1.

### Peripheral neuropathy due to paclitaxel: study of the temporal relationships between the therapeutic schedule and the clinical quantitative score (QST) and comparison with neurophysiological findings [^115YrvJH]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2008). Low credibility.

Peripheral neuropathy (PN) is one of the most common and dose-limiting side effects of paclitaxel, a chemiotherapeutic drug of proven efficacy in various tumours. We investigated the pathophysiological features of the PN and the temporal relationships between the development of the symptoms and signs associated with paclitaxel administration in two groups of patients with breast cancer: group A received paclitaxel alone (total cumulative dose range: 950–2,475 mg/m2), and group B paclitaxel and adriamycin (total cumulative dose range: 700–2,800 mg/m2). A codified assessment scoring clinical sensory and motor functions according to the Common Toxicity Scale and neurophysiological measurements were made before treatment, after the third and sixth cycles, and at the end of therapy. A total neuropathy score (TNS) included selected clinical and neurophysiological parameters. Both positive and negative sensory and motor symptoms and signs of PN developed during therapy, the most common being painful paresthesias, global areflexia and distal weakness. The neurophysiological study showed an early onset, length-independent and progressive sensory defect, and delayed, distal and length-dependent motor deficits. The neuropathy progressed faster in group A than in group B but, after therapy, most of the patients were TNS grade 2 regardless of their group. The temporal relationships between the PN and paclitaxel were robustly characterised, and thus provide reference data and a model for testing the efficacy of drugs designed to provide neuroprotection.

### Colchicine tablets 0.5 mg (Lodoco) [^1122GwK8]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

If a patient develops signs of neuromuscular toxicity, discontinue LODOCO, investigate other causes, and treat appropriately. Concomitant use of LODOCO and HMG CoA reductase inhibitors, gemfibrozil, and fenofibric acid or cyclosporine may potentiate the development of myopathy [see Drug interactions (7)].

Monitor patients with any degree of renal and hepatic impairment for adverse effects of LODOCO.

- Blood dyscrasias: myelosuppression, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, thrombocytopenia, pancytopenia, and aplastic anemia have been reported (5.1).

- Neuromuscular toxicity: Myotoxicity including rhabdomyolysis may occur, especially in combination with other drugs known to cause this effect. Consider temporary interruption or discontinuation of LODOCO (5.2).

### Antirheumatic drugs for cardiovascular disease prevention: the case for colchicine [^1117eSVJ]. RMD Open (2021). Medium credibility.

What can we learn from these trials?

The favourable results for canakinumab and colchicine confirm (low-grade) inflammation as an independent risk factor for cardiovascular events and a new opportunity for treatment. The negative results in the MTX study do not detract from this, as the levels of CRP, IL-1β and IL-6 did not decrease during MTX treatment.

In addition, the large number of included patients yield important information on side effects: cancers, particularly non-basal cell skin cancers, occurred more often in the MTX group; the sample size of this study exceeds previous RCTs within the field of rheumatology with MTX. Remarkably, the occurrence of myalgias did not differ significantly between colchicine and placebo users. Whether or not colchicine leads to an increased risk of non-cardiovascular death needs to be elucidated.

The data on the favourable cardiovascular effects and safety of colchicine are convincing, and the drug costs are low. Moreover, all rheumatologists have experience in the long-term use with this drug and side effects are usually mild and rare, although colchicine must not be described in patients with advanced renal disease and might be limited by leucopenia and polyneuropathy. Perhaps the most burning question is: how to implement the findings of these studies? We have several recommendations:

First, we believe that cardiologists are not (yet) used to prescribe anti-inflammatory drugs for secondary prevention of cardiovascular events and may be somewhat reluctant to do that. Thus, our first-line action should be to initiate contact between the rheumatologist and the cardiologist and to discuss whether the additional use of an anti-inflammatory drug such as colchicine is an option in patients at high risk for secondary cardiovascular events.

Clinical uses of colchicine and dosing

The indications and dosing of colchicine, both established and emerging, are outlined in Table 1. Lower doses are recommended for those with renal impairment and those receiving medications known to interact with colchicine (Table 2).

Table 1.
Established and emerging indications and doses of colchicine

Table 2.
Recommended dosing adjustment for colchicine

There is ample data that colchicine is effective in the management of gout. Colchicine is effective at preventing gout flares when commencing urate-lowering therapy as well as for the treatment of gout flares. It is essential to recognize that the older dosing regimen for treating gout flares, namely 1.2 mg stat followed by 0.6 mg hourly until the flare resolves or diarrhoea occurs, is no longer recommended due to the high rates of gastrointestinal toxicity and the evidence that lower doses of colchicine are effective without the associated gastrointestinal effects. In rheumatology practice, colchicine is also widely used in the treatment of CPP deposition disease, particularly to prevent and treat acute CPP crystal arthritis, as well as in the treatment of Behçet's syndrome, FMF and other systemic autoinflammatory syndromes. While colchicine has been used for some time in acute and recurrent pericarditis, more recently its beneficial effects have been observed in other cardiovascular diseases, including postoperative atrial fibrillation and coronary artery disease. The evidence for its use in cardiovascular disease has recently been reviewed by Deftereos et al.

The adverse effects of low-dose colchicine are also well known. The most common adverse effect is diarrhoea, which settles on cessation of colchicine. Small increases in alanine transaminase and creatine kinase are common with colchicine treatment over 2–4 years. Long-term colchicine therapy has also been associated with rare cases of neuromyotoxicity and rhabdomyolysis. There is no evidence that long-term colchicine increases the risk of kidney disease, cancer, sepsis or cytopaenias.

Discussion

Docetaxel and paclitaxel belong to the taxane class of chemotherapeutics that are widely used to treat various malignancies. Their primary mechanism of action is the disruption of microtubule polymerization. Common adverse effects of these medications include neutropenia, myelosuppression, cardiotoxicity, neurotoxicity, and hypersensitivity reactions. Taxane-induced sclerodermoid reaction is a rare side effect, with only a handful of cases having been documented. The lower extremities are most frequently affected and can lead to severe limitations in joint mobility. Although the pathogenesis of this phenomenon is unclear, paraneoplastic, pseudo–graft-versus-host disease, and autoimmune etiologies have been hypothesized.

Diagnosis of taxane-induced sclerodermoid reaction requires a high clinical suspicion. Several months after the initiation of docetaxel or paclitaxel treatment, patients may complain of painful acral erythema (erythrodysesthesia), which can resolve before the subsequent dose, paresthesia, and peripheral edema that is responsive to diuretics. Many patients who are placed on such chemotherapies are likely on other medications that can muddy the diagnosis. Immunofluorescence, serology, and routine laboratory tests are often unremarkable. A full-thickness skin biopsy with histopathology reveals fibrous septae of the subcutaneous fat and thickened collagen bundles, along with diffuse perivascular inflammatory cell infiltrates. Discontinuation of the taxane tends to resolve the edema and scleroderma-like skin changes within a year. Evidence of steroids in the management is conflicting, although concomitant use with methotrexate may lead to a more rapid regression.

### Colchicine and the heart [^112WmNno]. European Heart Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

In a recent review of drug-induced agranulocytosis, over 120 drugs including colchicine were listed as potentially causal. However, in the current literature only one case report is described in a patient taking low-dose therapy with no history of renal or liver disease. 16w

Prolonged use of colchicine has been associated with a transient rise in liver enzymes in ∼2% of patients, but as with statin therapy this did not result in treatment discontinuation or severe liver dysfunction. Other reported possible side-effects, including alopecia and neuropathy, have rarely been reported (< 1% of users), and appear to resolve rapidly after colchicine withdrawal. Although colchicine crosses the placenta, continuous use at doses of 0.5–1.0 mg daily during pregnancy does not increase the risk of birth defects or pregnancy loss in FMF. Despite entering breast milk, colchicine is considered safe during breast feeding.

Hence, when used at doses up to 1.0 mg daily in patients without advanced renal or liver disease, colchicine is safe. In the 90% of patients who do not develop early treatment intolerance, long-term use at this dosage proved to be safe and well tolerated.

6.2	Postmarketing Experience

Serious toxic manifestations associated with colchicine include myelosuppression, disseminated intravascular coagulation and injury to cells in the renal, hepatic, circulatory and central nervous systems.

These most often occur with excessive accumulation or overdosage [see Overdosage (10)].

The following adverse reactions have been identified with colchicine. These have been generally reversible upon temporarily interrupting treatment or lowering the dose of colchicine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

Neurological: sensory motor neuropathy

Dermatological: alopecia, maculopapular rash, purpura, rash

Digestive: abdominal cramping, abdominal pain, diarrhea, lactose intolerance, nausea, vomiting

Hematological: leukopenia, granulocytopenia, thrombocytopenia, pancytopenia, aplastic anemia

Hepatobiliary: elevated AST, elevated ALT

Musculoskeletal: myopathy, elevated CPK, myotonia, muscle weakness, muscle pain, rhabdomyolysis

Reproductive: azoospermia, oligospermia

### Colchicine-induced toxicity in a heart transplant patient with chronic renal failure [^113xCeai]. Clinical Toxicology (2008). Low credibility.

Introduction. Therapeutic doses of colchicine in patients with renal compromise and cyclosporine therapy may result in increased plasma concentrations of colchicine and colchicine toxicity. Case Report. A 60-year-old heart transplant patient with chronic renal failure and cyclosporine-induced immunosuppression was started on colchicine for suspected gout. Four days later, he developed multi-organ failure with rhabdomyolysis, liver damage, polyneuropathy, and cardiotoxicity. Colchicine intoxication was suspected and plasma levels were 7 ng/mL 36 hours after the sixth dose. Neutropenia with an absolute neutrophil count of 700 cells/mm3 was observed five days after colchicine discontinuation. Drug discontinuation, supportive care, antibiotic therapy for a concurrent infection, and G-CSF administration resulted in recovery and he was discharged from the hospital 3 weeks later. Discussion. Cyclosporine co-administration increases colchicine toxicity by a dual mechanism: cyclosporine inhibits P-glycoprotein resulting in increased intracellular colchicine concentrations and decreased hepatic and renal excretion of the drug and cyclosporine interacts with CYP3A4 to decreases the hepatic elimination of colchicine. On the other hand, colchicine may increase cyclosporine neurotoxicity by an addictive mechanism. Conclusions. Shortterm administration of therapeutic colchicine doses may cause life-threatening side effects in cyclosporine-treated patients with renal failure.

### Medication-induced exacerbation of neuropathy in Charcot Marie Tooth disease [^114UZ3SP]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2006). Low credibility.

Toxin or medication-induced worsening of preexisting peripheral neuropathy is a generally accepted but not well-studied phenomenon in humans. Drug-induced exacerbation of Charcot Marie Tooth disease (CMT) neuropathy is a common concern; a list of potential drugs to avoid is maintained by the CMT Association but with limited direct evidence or advice on relative risk. An extensive literature search for reported cases of drug effects in CMT patients found the vast majority concerned excessive vincristine toxicity in patients with undiagnosed demyelinating forms of CMT, many after 1 or 2 doses. The CMT North American database was also queried for all drug-related effects. All but one drug cited as worsening neuropathy was present on a compiled inclusive list. These results and other available evidence were used to develop a revised risk stratified list for CMT patients and clinicians to consult prior to discussing risk to benefit ratios and making treatment decisions.

### Myoedema: a forgotten sign in acute colchicine myopathy [^116ugBwv]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

Colchicine myopathy typically presents acutely to subacutely with progressive limb weakness. The patients may not be on high doses of colchicine but almost always have acute kidney injury. Dehydration from colchicine-induced diarrhoea is often a precipitating factor. The concomitant neurotoxicity may produce mild sensory complaints. This combination of acute neurological symptoms preceded by diarrhoea prompts the diagnosis of Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS). The absence of cranial nerve deficits, raised creatine kinase and myotonic discharges on electromyogram may help in differentiating this condition from GBS. We describe a clinical sign, myoedema — a mounding phenomenon of muscle that is elicited by percussion and resolves when the patient recovers. It aids in the bedside diagnosis of acute colchicine myopathy as well as distinguish it from other more common causes of acute flaccid paralysis. We also discuss the possible mechanism of colchicine toxicity and the mounding phenomenon.

### Colchicine concentrations and relationship with colchicine efficacy and adverse events: post hoc analysis of a randomized clinical trial of colchicine for gout flare prophylaxis [^116iEyZ6]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Of interest we have shown that both trough and peak colchicine concentrations are higher in those individuals receiving a statin. The interaction between colchicine and statins is well recognized, as both are substrates and inhibitors of CYP3A4 and P‐glycoprotein. Approximately 5% of colchicine is metabolized by CYP3A4 into inactive metabolites, with the majority of colchicine excreted via the liver and kidneys mediated by P‐glycoprotein. Simvastatin and atorvastatin are substrates of the CYP3A4 enzyme and P‐glycoprotein and are thus subject to interactions with colchicine, resulting in increased colchicine concentrations. In comparison, pravastatin and rosuvastatin are not substrates of CYP enzymes, and hence the concomitant use of CYP inhibitors or inducers, such as colchicine, does not affect them. Our finding that colchicine concentrations are higher in those receiving a statin is therefore not unexpected. Of more importance to patients and health care providers is whether there are clinically meaningful adverse events associated with the combination of colchicine and a statin. Both colchicine and statins can cause myopathy. There are four statin‐associated myopathy clinical phenotypes: rhabdomyolysis, myalgia or mild hyperCKemia (defined as less than five times the upper limit normal), self‐limited toxic statin myopathy, and myositis, which is typically an immune‐mediated necrotizing myopathy with anti–3‐hydroxy‐3‐methylglutaryl‐coenzyme A reductase antibodies. The number of participants in our study was too small to undertake reliable analysis of those taking a statin and colchicine; however, there was no increase in muscle‐related adverse events, including myalgia, in the whole group receiving colchicine compared to those receiving placebo. More recent larger studies have shown no increased risk of colchicine‐related adverse events in those also receiving a statin. For example, in a study of 674 people with gout, 486 received colchicine alone and 188 received colchicine and a statin. The incidence of myopathy was 2.7% in those taking both drugs, compared to 1.4% in those taking colchicine alone (P = 0.33). Multivariable analysis revealed an increased risk of myopathy in those with chronic kidney disease (hazard ratio [HR] 29.06), liver cirrhosis (HR 10.68), higher colchicine doses (HR 20.96), and concomitant CYP3A4 inhibitor use (HR 12.02). However, concomitant use of statins was not associated with increased risk of myopathy, even after adjustment for confounders (HR 1.12). In keeping with our findings of no increased risk of myopathy or muscle‐related adverse events, we observed no significant increase in CK levels over six months in those taking colchicine. It is important to recognize that there is variation in CK levels depending on age, renal function, physical activity, and ethnicity. Given the findings of our study and other recent studies, regular monitoring of CK may not be required; rather, targeted measurement of CK levels in individuals with muscle symptoms may be more appropriate.

### Peripheral neuropathy induced by microtubule-stabilizing agents [^114DTPmj]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2006). Low credibility.

Microtubule-stabilizing agents (MTSAs), including the taxanes and epothilones, are effective chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of many cancers. Neuropathy is a major adverse effect of MTSA-based chemotherapy, with severe peripheral neuropathy (grade 3 or 4) occurring in as many as 30% of patients treated with a MTSA. MTSA-induced neuropathy usually resolves gradually after cessation of the treatment. The most reliable method to accurately assess MTSA-induced neuropathy is by clinical evaluation, although additional techniques are being developed and evaluated. Among MTSA-induced neuropathy, the most extensively studied is that induced by taxanes; such a neuropathy usually presents as sensory neuropathy and is more common with paclitaxel than docetaxel. The incidence of MTSA-induced neuropathy seems to depend on the MTSA dose per treatment cycle, the schedule of treatment, and the duration of the infusion. Although there have been several small clinical trials with neuroprotective agents, early recognition and supportive care are the best approaches for prevention and management of MTSA-induced neuropathy. In the future, research should focus on elucidating the mechanism of MTSA-induced neuropathy, developing reliable in vivo and in vitro preclinical models to study MTSA-induced neuropathy, developing a more reliable grading system for MTSA-induced neuropathy, developing more reliable methods for evaluating MTSA-induced neuropathy, and evaluating the efficacy of potential neuroprotective agents in clinical trials.

### Management options for established chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy [^116b4K13]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a common and debilitating condition associated with a variety of chemotherapeutic agents. Clinicians are cognizant of the negative impact of CIPN on cancer treatment outcomes and patients' psychosocial functioning and quality of life. In an attempt to alleviate this problem, clinicians and patients try various therapeutic interventions, despite limited evidence to support efficacy of these treatments. The rationale for such use is mostly based on the evidence for the treatment options in non-CIPN peripheral neuropathy syndromes, as this area is more robustly studied than is CIPN treatment. In this manuscript, we examine the existing evidence for both CIPN and non-CIPN treatments and develop a summary of the best available evidence with the aim of developing a practical approach to the treatment of CIPN, based on available literature and clinical practice experience.

### Toxic and drug-induced peripheral neuropathies: updates on causes, mechanisms and management [^1153wR3r]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review discusses publications highlighting current research on toxic, chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathies (CIPNs), and drug-induced peripheral neuropathies (DIPNs).

Recent Findings

The emphasis in clinical studies is on the early detection and grading of peripheral neuropathies, whereas recent studies in animal models have given insights into molecular mechanisms, with the discovery of novel neuronal, axonal, and Schwann cell targets. Some substances trigger inflammatory changes in the peripheral nerves. Pharmacogenetic techniques are underway to identify genes that may help to predict individuals at higher risk of developing DIPNs. Several papers have been published on chemoprotectants; however, to date, this approach has not been shown effective in clinical trials.

Summary

Both length and nonlength-dependent neuropathies are encountered, including small-fiber involvement. The introduction of new diagnostic techniques, such as excitability studies, skin laser Doppler flowmetry, and pharmacogenetics, holds promise for early detection and to elucidate underlying mechanisms. New approaches to improve functions and quality of life in CIPN patients are discussed. Apart from developing less neurotoxic anticancer therapies, there is still hope to identify chemoprotective agents (erythropoietin and substances involved in the endocannabinoid system are promising) able to prevent or correct painful CIPNs.

### Chemotherapy-induced neuropathy [^114LtEYp]. Current Oncology Reports (2007). Low credibility.

Peripheral neuropathy is a common dose-limiting toxicity of chemotherapy. Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) causes numerous debilitating symptoms, impairs functional capacity, and results in dose reductions or possible cessation of chemotherapy. Analgesic or neurotropic agents are only modestly effective in treating neuropathic symptoms. Animal and human studies into the pathogenesis of CIPN have demonstrated heterogeneity in the mechanism(s) of nerve injury caused by individual agents, which may partly explain the wide variation in the resultant symptoms. Development of optimal therapeutic measures to treat CIPN requires continued research into the pathophysiologic basis of nerve injury, identification of risk factors for individual patients, development of reproducible and easy-to-use measurement scales, and finally, the performance of appropriately designed clinical trials to evaluate potentially promising agents.

### Prognostic factors for colchicine prophylaxis-related adverse events when initiating allopurinol for gout: retrospective cohort study [^115BYxw7]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Gout is caused by high serum urate levels leading to the formation of MSU crystals in and around joints. It is the most prevalent inflammatory arthritis and affects 2.5% of adults in the UK and 3.9% in the USA. Gout is characterized by recurrent flares of excruciating joint pain and inflammation, and is associated with substantial comorbidity and impaired health-related quality of life. Urate-lowering therapy (ULT) for gout leads to gradual dissolution of MSU crystals and cessation of flares over several months. However, initiating or escalating the dose of ULT often precipitates a gout flare, which may lead patients or practitioners to stop ULT, as they believe that it has exacerbated the gout. Anti-inflammatory prophylaxis to prevent such flares, most commonly with colchicine, is therefore recommended for several months when initiating ULT.

Diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting are common side-effects of colchicine, but rarely, it can cause more serious side-effects such as myopathy, rhabdomyolysis, neuropathy or bone marrow suppression. We recently reported a cohort study which determined the risk of adverse events severe enough to warrant seeking healthcare associated with colchicine prophylaxis when initiating allopurinol in patients with gout in UK primary care. We found that adverse events affected 1 in 15 people taking colchicine. However, serious adverse events were rare.

The risk of side-effects due to colchicine prophylaxis is thought to be influenced by patient characteristics. For example, the risk of serious events including neuromyopathy, rhabdomyolysis and bone marrow suppression is higher in people with chronic kidney disease (CKD), which affects one in four people with gout, and in people taking certain medications. Through its metabolism by CYP3A4, colchicine toxicity is theoretically increased by concomitant treatment with common drugs such as statins, fibrates, macrolide antibiotics, rate-limiting calcium-channel blockers (verapamil, diltiazem), digoxin, amiodarone and antifungals, as well as protease inhibitors and ciclosporin. Although colchicine is contraindicated in patients taking these medications, in our clinical experience from primary and secondary care, their co-prescription still commonly occurs. However, evidence that these factors are prognostic for adverse events is largely anecdotal or theoretical, and large research studies are lacking.

In this study, we aimed to assess to what degree co-prescriptions and other potential prognostic factors for adverse events, including age, gender, BMI, CKD and multimorbidity, affect the risk of adverse events when commencing colchicine prophylaxis for ULT in people with gout.

17. PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Patient Information).

Dosing Instructions

Advise patients to take LODOCO as prescribed, and patients should not alter or discontinue the medication without consulting their healthcare provider.
Advise patients that if the dose of LODOCO is missed, they should take the missed dose as soon as possible and return to the normal dosing schedule.
If a dose is skipped advise patient not to double the next dose.

Drug and food interactions

Patients should be advised that many drugs or other substances may interact with LODOCO and some interactions could be fatal. Therefore, patients should report to their healthcare provider all of the current medications they are taking and check with their healthcare provider before starting any new medications, particularly antibiotics. Patients should also be advised to report the use of nonprescription medication or herbal products. Advise patients that grapefruit and grapefruit juice may also interact and should not be consumed during LODOCO treatment.

Colchicine Toxicity

Advise patients that gastrointestinal symptoms are often the first sign of colchicine toxicity. Patients should be instructed to contact their healthcare provider if new symptoms develop.

Neuromuscular Toxicity

Inform patients that muscle pain or weakness, tingling or numbness in fingers or toes may occur with LODOCO alone or when it is used with certain other drugs. Concomitant use of LODOCO and HMG CoA reductase inhibitors, gemfibrozil, and fenofibric acid or cyclosporine may potentiate the development of myopathy (muscles weakness, fatigue). Patients developing any of these signs or symptoms must discontinue LODOCO and seek medical evaluation immediately. Concomitant use of interacting drugs, including statins, or renal or hepatic insufficiency increases the risk of developing toxicity.

### Peripheral neuropathies in rheumatic disease – a guide to diagnosis [^115CvkRF]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2012). Medium credibility.

Peripheral neuropathy is a common neurological disorder that can be associated with a wide range of conditions, including rheumatic disease. Although the association of the two disorders can be coincidental, an underlying pathogenic link can occur in many instances, which can affect treatment options. The presentation of peripheral neuropathy can be multifaceted, an important consideration when recognizing the condition and optimizing diagnosis. Furthermore, understanding the diagnostic strategy will help physicians treating patients with rheumatic disease who develop peripheral neuropathy. Finally, although available treatment options have greatly reduced the risk of patients with inflammatory disorders developing systemic complications, among which includes peripheral neuropathy, new therapeutic agents can trigger toxic or immune-mediated neuropathies and treatment will need to be adjusted accordingly. In this Review, we will discuss the general approach for diagnosing patients with peripheral neuropathy, and detail the presentation, pathophysiological features and general rules of treatment of patients with peripheral neuropathy in the context of rheumatic disease.

5. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

5.1 Blood Dyscrasias

LODOCO can cause myelosuppression, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, thrombocytopenia, pancytopenia, and aplastic anemia, which can be life-threatening or fatal [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. Gastrointestinal symptoms often are the first sign of colchicine toxicity, so new symptoms should prompt an evaluation for toxicity. Concomitant use of drugs that reduce the metabolism of colchicine or the presence of hepatic or renal impairment increases the risk of developing blood dyscrasias.

Use of LODOCO in patients with pre-existing blood dyscrasias, renal failure (Creatinine clearance less than 15 mL/minute), or severe hepatic dysfunction, and concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or P-glycoprotein inhibitors is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4)].

Concomitant use of moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors with LODOCO should be avoided in patients with risk factors for increased systemic exposure of colchicine. Monitor patients with any degree of renal impairment and hepatic impairment for colchicine toxicity [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6, 8.7)].

5.2 Neuromuscular Toxicity

LODOCO can cause neuromuscular toxicity and rhabdomyolysis. Concomitant use of drugs that reduce the metabolism of colchicine or the presence of hepatic or renal impairment increases the risk of developing neuromuscular toxicity. Gastrointestinal symptoms often are the first sign of colchicine toxicity, so new symptoms should prompt evaluation for toxicity. Use of LODOCO in patients with renal failure (Creatinine clearance less than 15 mL/minute), or severe hepatic dysfunction, and concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or P-glycoprotein inhibitors is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4)]. Concomitant use of moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors with LODOCO should be avoided in patients with risk factors for increased systemic exposure of colchicine [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6, 8.7) and Drug Interactions (7)].

### Colchicine concentrations and relationship with colchicine efficacy and adverse events: post hoc analysis of a randomized clinical trial of colchicine for gout flare prophylaxis [^111RCkTS]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Low‐dose oral colchicine (0.5 mg once or twice daily) is one of the first‐line recommended therapies for prevention of gout flares when commencing urate‐lowering therapy. Although colchicine may be effective, it has a number of potential adverse events, of which the most common are gastrointestinal, including nausea and diarrhea. In people with gout, gastrointestinal adverse events are dose dependent, with more gastrointestinal adverse events observed in those who received a higher dose (4.8 mg over four hours) versus a low dose (1.8 mg over one hour) in a study of gout flares, albeit with no difference in circulating maximum concentration (C max) between the two colchicine doses in healthy volunteers. Other less common adverse events include bone marrow suppression and neuromyotoxicity, which may occur with more prolonged use.

SIGNIFICANCE & INNOVATIONS

Colchicine concentrations increase with concomitant statin use; this does not result in muscle‐related adverse events.
Regular monitoring of creatine kinase (CK) may not be required; rather, targeted measurement of CK in individuals with muscle symptoms may be more appropriate.
Colchicine therapeutic drug monitoring is of limited value in clinical practice.

Impaired kidney function, which is common in people with gout, is reported to be a predictor of colchicine adverse events. Because of the risk, it has been suggested that a complete blood count and a creatine kinase (CK) measurement should be performed every six months in patients who are receiving long‐term prophylactic colchicine, defined as 0.5 mg daily for six or more months. The prolonged period suggested for anti‐inflammatory prophylaxis and the risk of adverse events have led to a general reluctance to use prophylaxis by many clinicians and people with gout. A study of a nurse‐led educational intervention for people with gout with recurrent flares reported that only 4% of participants opted for anti‐inflammatory prophylaxis when urate‐lowering therapy was increased. Thus, the ability to accurately predict who may obtain the most clinical benefit with the least adverse events based on clinical factors would be of clinical use.

### Peripheral neuropathy in patients treated with leflunomide [^112dQySj]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

Our objective was to describe the clinical features, time course, and outcome of new-onset peripheral neuropathy occurring in patients treated with leflunomide.

Methods

Case reports of peripheral neuropathy submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration in association with leflunomide use were reviewed. Data on patient demographics, underlying medical conditions and medications, details of leflunomide therapy, and treatment and outcome of the neuropathy event were abstracted. Time to neuropathy onset and time to improvement or recovery were analyzed by survival analysis.

Results

Of 80 reported patients, 61% were women. The patients' mean age was 62 years. Symptoms of peripheral neuropathy began after a mean of 6 months of leflunomide use (range, 3 days to 3 years). Electrodiagnostic testing in 37 patients was consistent with a distal axonal, sensory, or sensorimotor polyneuropathy in most patients. Patients who stopped leflunomide use within 30 days of neuropathy symptom onset were more likely to have improvement or recovery than those who continued taking leflunomide for a longer period (P < .001).

Conclusion

Leflunomide use is associated with peripheral neuropathy in some patients. This neuropathy is usually axonal in nature, affecting multiple sensory or motor nerves of distal extremities. Patients who stopped leflunomide use within 30 days of symptom onset were more likely to have improvement of symptoms or complete recovery than were patients who continued to use the drug for longer periods of time.

### Colchicine neuromyopathy: a report of six cases [^114DqkCn]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2002). Low credibility.

Colchicine has been in use for therapeutic purposes for many years. It can, however, cause subacute onset muscle and peripheral nerve toxicity in patients with chronic renal failure. In this report we describe 6 patients who developed neuromyopathy after the administration of colchicine. All patients presented with proximal muscle weakness, elevated serum creatine kinase (CK) levels, and neuropathy and/or myopathy on electromyography (EMG). The diagnosis of colchicine toxicity was confirmed in all cases by the normalization of CK levels and EMG after discontinuation of the drug. Toxicity developed in 4 renal failure patients on therapeutic doses of the drug, while one patient took a massive dose for suicidal reasons, and the other was on high-dose therapy. Patients using colchicine — especially those with renal failure — should be warned about the side effects of the drug and physicians should be careful in the administration of the drug.

Abstract

Objectives

Colchicine is commonly used to prevent flares when starting urate-lowering therapy for gout. Patients with gout are frequently concurrently prescribed other medications (such as statins) that may interact with colchicine, increasing the risk of adverse events. The aim of this study was to describe potential prognostic factors for adverse events in patients prescribed colchicine when initiating allopurinol.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective cohort study in linked UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink and Hospital Episode Statistics datasets. Adults initiating allopurinol for gout with colchicine (1 April 1997 to 30 November 2016) were included. Potential prognostic factors were defined, and the likelihood of adverse events, including diarrhoea, nausea or vomiting, myocardial infarction, neuropathy, myalgia, myopathy, rhabdomyolysis and bone marrow suppression, were estimated.

Results

From 1 April 1997 to 30 November 2016, 13 945 people with gout initiated allopurinol with colchicine prophylaxis [mean age 63.9 (. 14.7) years, 78.2% male]. One-quarter (26%, 95% CI 25%, 27%) were prescribed one or more potentially interacting medicines, most commonly statins (21%, 95% CI 20%, 22%). Statins were not associated with increased adverse events, although other drugs were associated with some adverse outcomes. Diarrhoea and myocardial infarction were associated with more comorbidities and more severe chronic kidney disease.

Conclusion

People were given colchicine prophylaxis despite commonly having preexisting prescriptions for medications with potential to interact with colchicine. Adverse events were more common in people who had more comorbidities and certain potentially interacting medications. Our findings will provide much-needed information about prognostic factors for colchicine-related adverse events that can inform treatment decisions about prophylaxis when initiating allopurinol.

### Genetic advances uncover mechanisms of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy [^113F7bDD]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a common dose-limiting toxicity experienced in 30–40% of patients undergoing treatment with various chemotherapeutics, including taxanes, vinca alkaloids, epothilones, proteasome inhibitors, and thalidomide. Importantly, CIPN significantly affects a patient's quality of life. Recent genetic association studies are enhancing our understanding of CIPN pathophysiology and serve as a foundation for identification of genetic biomarkers to predict toxicity risk and for the development of novel strategies for prevention and treatment.

Adverse outcomes

We defined incident adverse events using clinical codes [Read/ Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine (SNOMED) in primary care; International Classification of Diseases (ICD) in secondary care] during the period of colchicine treatment. Events of interest were diarrhoea, nausea or vomiting, myocardial infarction (MI), neuropathy, myalgia, myopathy, rhabdomyolysis and bone marrow suppression. Each adverse event was analysed separately. Patients were excluded from the analysis if they had a Read/SNOMED/ICD code for the outcome in question in the 3 months preceding the index date. Consistent with the accepted practice for large database research, we assumed that the absence of a recorded adverse event meant that the patient did not consult for that condition or that if they did, the clinician did not think it was of sufficient relevance to record in the coded data. Code lists for all outcomes, exposures and covariates were compiled by a general practitioner and a rheumatologist and are available at.

Potentially interacting prescriptions

Prescriptions for medications that could potentially interact with colchicine (statins, fibrates, verapamil, diltiazem, digoxin, amiodarone, oral ketoconazole and macrolide antibiotics) in the 30 days before the index date were considered potentially interacting prescriptions.

Potential prognostic factors

We considered the following patient factors that might be associated with the rate of adverse outcomes: age in quartiles, sex, Charlson comorbidity index (scored 0, 1, 2, 3, 4+), BMI [categorized as normal (18.5–24.9 kg/m 2), overweight (25–29.9 kg/m 2) and obese (≥ 30 kg/m 2)], CKD category [1–2 (estimated glomerular filtration rate, eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min), 3 (eGFR 30–59 mL/min), 4–5 (eGFR < 30 mL/min) defined by diagnostic codes or a record for eGFR < 60 mL/min] and potentially interacting prescriptions (defined above). All were defined before the index date.

### Safety and efficacy of colchicine in crystal-induced arthritis flare in 54 patients with severe chronic kidney disease [^117Ej1Qh]. RMD Open (2024). Medium credibility.

A recent systematic review from 1 January 1959 to 31 January 2018 on gout flare prophylaxis and therapy in patients with CKD (GFR < 60 mL/min)found 33 studies that allowed for an analysis of the effectiveness and/or safety according to the renal function. However, only 20 studies concerned colchicine. Only 42 patients with severe CKD (G4–5) were included in this systematic review. Only five studies provided efficacy results, but no conclusions could be drawn because of heterogeneity and lack of details. Regarding tolerance, 15 studies reported the development of neuromyopathy and associated rhabdomyolysis, but the link between these AEs and the use of colchicine was not clearly established. In 2014, Wason et al conducted an open-label, non-randomised, single-dose study to determine the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of colchicine (0.6 mg; but haemodialysis patients received 0.6 mg before and after haemodialysis) in patients with various degrees of renal failure (CKD G1–G5). Eight patients were included for each degree of renal function. No accumulation of colchicine was demonstrated, except a doubling of exposure in patients with moderate and severe CKD (G3–G4). These findings cannot be extrapolated to current practice because the study was a single-dose pharmacokinetic study. However, it is a reminder of carefulness. Another study investigated colchicine toxicity in patients receiving chronic colchicine delivery for various conditions, in a context of hemodialysis. It included 22 patients on maintenance haemodialysis who were taking colchicine for > 6 months and 20 control patients on haemodialysis not taking colchicine. The two groups did not differ in myoneuropathic signs and symptoms or blood counts except for white blood cell count, which was significantly higher in patients taking colchicine.

Discussion

This is the first large observational study to investigate prognostic factors for adverse events related to colchicine prophylaxis when initiating allopurinol for gout. Using UK primary care data linked to hospital admission records, we were able to capture rare but potentially serious side effects. We found that females were more likely to develop diarrhoea and nausea/vomiting. Older age was linked to a greater risk of diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting, and myocardial infarction. A quarter of people with gout taking colchicine prophylaxis were already prescribed a medication with the potential to interact with colchicine. In the majority of cases, this was a statin (mainly simvastatin or atorvastatin). Whilst there were some associations of medicines and some adverse outcomes, there were no associations between statins and any adverse outcomes except for atorvastatin with MI. Significant increases in the risk of diarrhoea were seen with amiodarone, fibrates and macrolide antibiotics, neuropathy with diltiazem, bone marrow suppression with fibrates and ketoconazole, myalgia with amiodarone, fibrates and verapamil, and MI with diltiazem and macrolides. A higher comorbidity index was associated with a significantly increased risk of diarrhoea and MI. CKD was significantly associated with an increased risk of MI.
