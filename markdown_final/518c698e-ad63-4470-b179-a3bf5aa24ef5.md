Surgical treatment of mickeles

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the surgical treatment of Meckel's diverticulum. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the clinical entity and its epidemiology. Then, I should verify the indications for surgery in symptomatic versus asymptomatic cases. Next, I will examine preoperative diagnostic strategies and their limitations. After that, I need to compare open versus laparoscopic approaches and special techniques. Then, I should detail operative techniques: diverticulectomy versus segmental resection and when to choose each. I will also consider special scenarios like torsion, tumors, and intussusception. Finally, I should review postoperative outcomes, complications, and synthesize a practical decision framework with attention to controversies and evidence quality.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity and baseline risk. Meckel's diverticulum is the most common congenital gastrointestinal anomaly, present in roughly 1.2–4% of the population, with a male predominance for complications and a lifetime complication risk around 4–6% that declines with age, which frames the threshold for intervention in incidental cases [^114BQUyR] [^113UusBp] [^1148EApY].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about operating on everyone. I need to separate symptomatic from asymptomatic presentations. Symptomatic Meckel's diverticulum includes bleeding, obstruction, diverticulitis, perforation, and intussusception, and in these settings surgery is indicated after stabilization; asymptomatic, incidentally discovered Meckel's diverticulum remains controversial, and I should double-check the balance of risks and benefits before recommending prophylactic resection [^116cCCqa] [^114BQUyR].

> Next, I should review diagnostic strategies and their pitfalls. Meckel's scan (technetium-99m pertechnetate) has higher sensitivity in children (about 80–92%) but lower in adults (about 62–88%), and a negative scan does not exclude disease; small-bowel capsule endoscopy has limited yield, while device-assisted enteroscopy is sensitive but invasive; CT can identify complications and active bleeding and may guide operative planning; in adults, a negative Meckel's scan rarely changes management, so laparoscopy often becomes both diagnostic and therapeutic when imaging is non-diagnostic [^116cCCqa] [^113cBcMf] [^1142Pn98] [^1172n8RM].

> I will now examine surgical approaches. Open surgery has long been standard and remains appropriate in unstable patients or when resources are limited; however, laparoscopy is safe, cost-effective, and associated with shorter length of stay in children, and single-incision laparoscopic surgery may further reduce postoperative pain and length of stay, though I should confirm feasibility case-by-case and be prepared to convert if exposure is inadequate [^114gc6nW] [^1142Pn98] [^115waCGn].

> Let me think about the core operative decision: diverticulectomy versus segmental ileal resection. For a narrow-based diverticulum without palpable ectopic tissue or active inflammation, a wedge diverticulectomy with transverse closure is reasonable; for a broad base, palpable ectopic tissue, inflammation, perforation, or bleeding, segmental resection with end-to-end ileoileostomy is preferred to ensure complete removal of ectopic mucosa and ulcerated adjacent ileum, thereby minimizing recurrence risk; wait, I should verify the bleeding caveat — some pediatric data suggest diverticulectomy-only can eradicate gastric heterotopia without excess re-bleeding, but I need to ensure negative margins and consider patient-specific factors before choosing this option [^114N3MJQ] [^115dMZUX].

> But wait, what if the presentation is atypical or the anatomy is distorted. In massive lower GI bleeding with unclear localization, emergent laparotomy with segmental resection may be lifesaving; in torsion of the diverticulum, resection of the affected segment is indicated given ischemia risk; in suspected or confirmed neoplasm, segmental resection with appropriate oncologic margins and nodal evaluation is warranted; in intussusception with a lead point, reduction plus resection of the lead point is standard, with laparoscopy favored when feasible [^112KpHPN] [^115Ldkqi] [^1126T61a] [^116S6fhi].

> I should confirm the technical steps for open diverticulectomy and how they translate laparoscopically. Classically, after identifying the diverticulum about 2 feet proximal to the ileocecal valve, the mesodiverticulum is divided, the diverticulum is excised, and the ileum is closed in two layers or with a stapler; laparoscopically, the same principles apply with endoscopic staplers or hand-sewn closure, and exteriorization via a minilaparotomy is a useful hybrid when intracorporeal suturing is challenging or the base is very broad [^1126T61a] [^112gH7kc].

> Next, I should review postoperative outcomes and complications. In children, laparoscopic approaches are associated with shorter length of stay than open surgery; overall complications include bleeding, infection, adhesive obstruction, and wound issues, with a key concern being recurrent bleeding if ectopic gastric mucosa is incompletely excised; interestingly, some series report higher morbidity after resection of incidental Meckel's diverticulum compared with symptomatic cases, underscoring the need to individualize decisions in asymptomatic patients [^114gc6nW] [^1134UzLz] [^114BQUyR].

> Hold on, I should verify the controversy around incidental Meckel's diverticulum. A large systematic review found that leaving an incidental Meckel's in place did not increase long-term complications, whereas prophylactic resection increased postoperative morbidity; the number needed to treat to prevent one death was estimated at 758, arguing against routine resection; however, more recent pediatric-focused reviews suggest a trend toward resection in selected incidental cases, particularly in younger patients or when high-risk features are present, so I need to weigh age, morphology, and patient preference carefully [^114BQUyR] [^111KHJHy].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision framework. For symptomatic Meckel's diverticulum, stabilize and proceed to definitive resection, choosing diverticulectomy for narrow-based, uninflamed lesions and segmental resection for broad-based, inflamed, perforated, or bleeding cases; for asymptomatic Meckel's diverticulum, consider prophylactic resection in children and young adults with high-risk features such as long length, narrow base, adhesions, or ectopic tissue, while observing in older adults or those with significant comorbidity; throughout, favor laparoscopy when feasible, but maintain a low threshold to convert or choose open surgery in unstable patients or when exposure is limited [^115EKtQ4] [^114N3MJQ] [^114gc6nW].

> Finally, I should double-check special pearls that change management. Radioguided surgery with technetium-99m can aid localization in reoperative or obscure cases; in adults, a negative Meckel's scan should not delay laparoscopic exploration when clinical suspicion is high; and in pediatrics, early laparoscopy both expedites diagnosis and allows definitive treatment with favorable recovery profiles, which reinforces its role as first-line in experienced hands [^112K9q39] [^1142Pn98] [^114gc6nW].

---

The surgical treatment of Meckel's diverticulum is **indicated for symptomatic cases** — bleeding, obstruction, diverticulitis, or perforation [^113UusBp] — and is typically managed by **laparoscopic diverticulectomy or segmental resection** [^1142Pn98] [^114gc6nW], with stapled or hand-sewn closure based on base width and ectopic tissue [^114N3MJQ]. Laparoscopy is preferred for its shorter stay, faster recovery, and lower wound complications, though open surgery is reserved for instability or limited resources [^114gc6nW] [^112gH7kc]. Incidental asymptomatic Meckel's diverticulum is generally not resected due to low complication risk and higher morbidity with prophylactic surgery [^114BQUyR]; resection is considered only with high-risk features (long, narrow base, adhesions, or ectopic mucosa) [^115EKtQ4]. Postoperative complications include bleeding, infection, adhesive obstruction, and anastomotic leak, with recurrence rare if ectopic mucosa is fully excised [^1134UzLz] [^115dMZUX].

---

## Indications for surgical intervention

Surgical intervention is **indicated** in the following scenarios:

- **Symptomatic Meckel's diverticulum**: Presenting with gastrointestinal bleeding, obstruction, diverticulitis, or perforation [^113UusBp] [^116cCCqa].

- **Incidental findings with high-risk features**: Long diverticulum (> 2 cm), narrow base, adhesions, or evidence of ectopic mucosa [^115EKtQ4].

- **Pediatric patients**: Higher risk of complications, particularly bleeding, often prompting surgical management [^1148EApY].

---

## Surgical techniques

The choice of surgical technique **depends on patient factors**, diverticulum anatomy, and surgeon expertise:

| **Technique** | **Indications** | **Advantages** | **Disadvantages** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Laparoscopic diverticulectomy | - Narrow-based diverticulum <br/> - Minimal ectopic tissue | - Minimally invasive <br/> - Shorter hospital stay <br/> - Faster recovery [^notfound] | - Technical complexity <br/> - Limited access [^112gH7kc] |
| Laparoscopic segmental resection | - Wide-based diverticulum <br/> - Ectopic tissue <br/> - Inflammation <br/> - Perforation | - Complete removal of ectopic tissue <br/> - Lower recurrence [^1134UzLz] | - More invasive <br/> - Longer operative time |
| Open surgery | - Unstable patients <br/> - Extensive adhesions <br/> - Limited laparoscopic resources | - Direct visualization <br/> - Control [^notfound] | - Longer recovery <br/> - Higher wound complications [^notfound] |

---

## Laparoscopic vs. open surgery

Laparoscopic surgery is **increasingly preferred** for its minimally invasive nature, shorter hospital stay, and faster recovery [^114gc6nW]. However, open surgery remains indicated for unstable patients, extensive adhesions, or limited laparoscopic resources [^112gH7kc].

---

## Management of incidental Meckel's diverticulum

The management of **incidentally discovered Meckel's diverticulum** remains controversial. Recent evidence suggests that prophylactic resection of asymptomatic Meckel's diverticulum is not routinely recommended due to low complication risk and higher morbidity associated with prophylactic surgery [^114BQUyR]. Resection may be considered in the presence of high-risk features, such as a long diverticulum, narrow base, adhesions, or ectopic mucosa [^115EKtQ4].

---

## Postoperative complications and recurrence

Postoperative complications include:

- **Bleeding**: Rare if ectopic mucosa is completely excised [^115dMZUX].

- **Infection**: Managed with antibiotics and wound care [^notfound].

- **Adhesive intestinal obstruction**: Occurs in approximately 3% of cases [^notfound].

- **Anastomotic leak**: Rare but serious complication requiring surgical intervention [^111KHJHy].

Recurrence is **rare** if ectopic mucosa is completely removed [^115dMZUX].

---

## Prognosis

The prognosis following surgical treatment of Meckel's diverticulum is **excellent**, with low recurrence and complication rates when ectopic mucosa is completely excised [^115dMZUX]. Laparoscopic approaches further improve outcomes by reducing hospital stay and recovery time [^114gc6nW].

---

Surgical treatment of Meckel's diverticulum is indicated for symptomatic cases or incidental findings with high-risk features. Laparoscopic surgery is preferred for its minimally invasive nature and faster recovery, while open surgery is reserved for specific indications. The prognosis is **excellent** with low recurrence and complication rates.

Conclusion

Meckel's diverticulum is the most common congenital anomaly of the gastrointestinal tract but the life time risk of developing complications in this vestigial organ is 4–6%. Complications which require emergency treatment includes bleeding, obstruction, diverticulitis and perforation and the appropriate knowledge of various pathophysiologies by which a Meckel's diverticulum can cause complication should be kept in mind for the better management and to prevent recurrences. The diagnosis of symptomatic Meckel's diverticulum needs a high degree of suspicion as the preoperative clinical and investigational diagnosis is difficult to be made with accuracy. Open surgery has long been used as an effective method to deal with complicated Meckel's diverticulum. However, in this age of minimally invasive surgery, laparoscopic management of complicated Meckel's diverticulum is safe, cost effective and efficient as proved by various reports and studies. Although both the methods have their own limitations, still the choice of management depends on patients condition, surgeon's experiences, and availability of the laparoscopic instruments.

### Emergency surgery for Meckel's diverticulum [^113u32Nq]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Introduction

Meckel's diverticulum was first described by Fabricius Hildanus in 1598. The name derives from the German anatomist Johann Friedrich Meckel who described the embryological and pathological features in 1809. Although it generally remains silent but life threatening complications may arise making it an important structure for having a detailed knowledge of its anatomical and pathophysiological properties to deal with such complications.

The literature is replete with the description of Meckel's diverticulum for its clinical presentations and complications. A search of Pubmed with the word "Meckel's diverticulum" shows 2835 articles till May 2008. However, the emergency surgery part of the symptomatic Meckel's diverticulum is still deficient in the literature. This seems to be so because most of the articles have been in the form of case reports or case series, so that the management strategies have been highly individualized based on both the patients condition and on the surgeons perspective. This seems to be the appropriate approach in an emergency condition. We intend to underscore some general principles used by these surgeons in their emergency surgeries. The current work attempts to highlight the various life threatening complications of Meckel's diverticulum and to present the surgical strategies used in the emergency conditions so far in the form of a review of the works presented in the literature. Our aim behind this presentation is to cover the possible indications, methods, their complications and the outcome of these surgical techniques. For this, we made an extensive literature search using Google and Pubmed with the words-"Meckel's diverticulum", "Complications", "Management" and "Emergency surgery". All the relevant articles containing the surgical aspects of symptomatic Meckel's diverticulum till May 2008 were collected and analyzed.

### National trends in the surgical management of Meckel's diverticulum [^114gc6nW]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Treatment recommendations for Meckel's diverticulum (MD) come mostly from single-institution case series. The objective of this study was to review the surgical management and outcomes of children undergoing Meckel's diverticulectomy using contemporary data from a national database.

Methods

We queried 2007 to 2008 data from the Pediatric Health Information System database and analyzed demographic and outcome variables for patients undergoing surgical resection of MD. Cases were classified as primary (symptomatic MD) or secondary (incidental MD). Outcomes in primary cases were compared between open and laparoscopic approaches. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS (Chicago, IL).

Results

Eight hundred fifteen children underwent Meckel's diverticulectomy. Meckel's diverticulectomy was more common in boys (boy-girl, 2.3:1), and half (53%) of the children required surgery before their fourth birthday. More cases (n = 485; 60%) were classified as primary, and most children were approached by laparotomy (75%). The most common presentations for primary cases were obstruction (30%), bleeding (27%), and intussusception (19%). In the primary group, patients treated with the laparoscopic approach had a shorter length of stay (open approach, 5.7 ± 5.2 days; laparoscopic approach, 4.3 ± 2.7 days; P < .02).

Conclusion

These data describe current trends in the surgical treatment of MD in the United States. Laparoscopic Meckel's diverticulectomy appears to shorten length of stay but is used much less frequently than the traditional open approach.

### Demystifying Meckel's diverticulum-a guide for the gastroenterologist [^116cCCqa]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Meckel's diverticulum (MD) is a common congenital ileal diverticulum. Whilst mostly asymptomatic, 4–9% develop complications, such as small bowel obstruction, diverticulitis or bleeding. In 1933, Charles Mayo wrote that MD is 'frequently suspected, often looked for and seldom found', and it continues to pose a diagnostic challenge today. With advancements in small bowel imaging and endoscopy, this review outlines the gastroenterologist's approach to MD.

Recent Findings

There are a number of strategies for diagnosing MD. Meckel's scan has a sensitivity of 80–92% in children but 62–88% in adults. The diagnostic yield of small bowel capsule endoscopy (SBCE) is only up to 50%. Device-assisted enteroscopy (DAE) has a sensitivity of 84–100% for MD but is invasive. The definitive treatment for symptomatic MD is surgical resection, but the management of asymptomatic cases are controversial. A recent systematic review favoured resection of incidental MD.

Summary

A high index of suspicion and a multimodality combination of SBCE, Meckel's scan, CT and DAE is often required to diagnose MD. Complicated MD is treated by surgical resection. Management of incidental MD remains debated, although current evidence appears to favour resection.

### Meckel's diverticulum: new solutions for an old problem? [^115oQnXq]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Meckel's diverticulum (MD) is the most commonly encountered true diverticulum in the small bowel. Although overall a rare cause of gastrointestinal bleeding, it remains an important differential in a child/young adult presenting with lower gastrointestinal bleeding. We present two MD cases, one associated with brisk bleeding resulting in haemodynamic instability and the other in insidious blood loss causing symptoms of chronic iron deficiency. These cases illustrate the heterogeneous nature of the clinical picture associated with Meckel's diverticulae, a condition most gastroenterological and surgical units will encounter. We subsequently discuss the diagnostic and management dilemma Meckel's diverticulae pose and appraise the latest evidence and management strategies in this regard.

### Incidentally detected Meckel diverticulum: to resect or not to resect? [^114BQUyR]. Annals of Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Management of incidentally detected Meckel diverticulum (MD) remains controversial. Our aims were to establish: (1) the prevalence of MD; (2) the morbidity and (3) mortality due to MD.

Methods

Systematic review: A total of 244 papers meeting defined criteria were included; there were no prospective or randomized studies. MD prevalence and mortality from autopsy studies, postoperative complications, and outcome of incidentally detected MD were extracted. Population-based data: Data were obtained from national databases on MD as cause of death, and on number of MD resections per year.

Results

The prevalence of MD is 1.2% and historical mortality of MD was 0.01%. The current mortality from MD is 0.001%. The number of MD resections per year per 100,000 population decreased significantly after the pediatric age range (P < 0.001). Resection of incidentally detected MD has a significantly higher postoperative complication rate than leaving it in situ (P < 0.0001). The long-term outcome of patients with incidentally detected MD left in situ showed no complications. Seven-hundred fifty-eight patients would require incidentally detected MD resection to prevent 1 death from MD.

Conclusions

MD is present in 1.2% of the population, it is a very rare cause of mortality, and it is primarily a disease of the young. Leaving an incidentally detected MD in situ reduces the risk of postoperative complications without increasing late complications. A large number of MD resections would need to be performed to prevent 1 death from MD. The above evidence does not support the resection of incidentally detected MD.

### Radiological features of Meckel's diverticulum and its complications [^113cBcMf]. Clinical Radiology (2009). Low credibility.

Meckel's diverticulum is the most common congenital abnormality of the small bowel. The majority of patients with this anomaly will remain asymptomatic; however, several complications may occur, including obstruction, intussusception, perforation, diverticulitis, and gastrointestinal haemorrhage. These complications may produce a variety of different clinical features and radiological appearances. The purpose of this article is to review the potential imaging manifestations of Meckel's diverticulum and its complications and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the imaging techniques available.

### Massive lower gastrointestinal bleeding due to Meckel's diverticulum in an atypical position [^112KpHPN]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2025). Medium credibility.

Case summary

The patient presented with massive lower gastrointestinal bleeding. During the operation, intraluminal blood was discovered, but the source was not immediately evident. Definitive treatment involved surgical resection of the diverticulum en bloc with the adjacent intestinal segment. Meckel's diverticulectomy has been described, but given the location of the MD in this patient, bowel resection was indicated.

Although prophylactic resection of incidentally discovered MD remains controversial, symptomatic MD requires prompt surgical intervention. In this case, surgical consultation was obtained after the patient became unstable and imaging revealed active bleeding. Embolization was not pursued due to the risk of bowel ischemia, and endoscopy was not feasible given poor visualization in an unprepped colon. Awareness of atypical MD anatomy was critical to localizing the source and achieving hemorrhage control. Gastrointestinal hemorrhage is a multidisciplinary challenge, and an operation was ultimately chosen as the safest and most definitive approach in this context.

### Imaging of Meckel's diverticulum in adults: pictorial essay [^111mzA3J]. Clinical Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

Meckel's diverticulum is the most common congenital abnormality of the gastrointestinal tract. It is usually asymptomatic but may present with complications of acute diverticular inflammation, ulceration, hemorrhage, small bowel obstruction, perforation, retained foreign bodies, enterolith formation, and neoplasm development. Thus, the preoperative radiological diagnosis is crucial for proper management of the patients. This article reviews the anatomic and clinical features of Meckel's and describes the role of imaging in the detection of Meckel's and evaluation of its associated pathological processes.

### Emergency surgery for Meckel's diverticulum [^114N3MJQ]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

When bleeding is massive and can not be controlled by conservative methods, then this is an emergency situation which needs to be dealt promptly with surgical resection of Meckel's diverticulum after initial resuscitation of the patient with blood transfusion. The approach can be through laparotomy, laparoscopy or laparoscopic assisted. The aim of the surgery is to resect the Meckel's diverticulum, all ectopic gastric mucosa, and any ulcerated adjacent ileum to prevent recurrent bleeding. During surgery if we find a narrow base without any mass in the lumen, then a wedge resection of the diverticulum with transverse closure of the ileum is the ideal method. We can use linear stapler in this situation to close the ileum. But when the base is wide or mass of ectopic tissue is palpable or when there is inflammation, it is preferable to resect the involved bowel followed by end-to-end ileoileostomy. The rationale of this procedure is derived from the observation that in short Meckel's diverticulum, ectopic mucosa can be seen even in the proximal portion, as compared to long diverticulum where the mucosa has been found mostly in the apical region.

### Diverting opinions: surgical debate around method of Meckel's resection [^111qDe9c]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Meckel's diverticulum (MD) is the most common congenital anomaly of the GI tract and can present with obstruction, inflammation or haemorrhage, which requires surgical intervention. Primary malignancies of MD are rare with a reported incidence of 0.5%-3.2%. The standard treatment of symptomatic MDs is resection. However, there is no standard protocol regarding the type of resection. Similarly, for asymptomatic MDs, there is no standard management. We report our experience with a patient in her 60s who required emergent surgery for perforated MD where histology revealed a plexiform fibromyxoma at the junction of the ileum and MD. Current surgical resection techniques for MDs vary from linear or wedge diverticulectomy to segmental bowel resection. This case of an unexpected tumour supports segmental bowel resection in the treatment of MD and raises the question of whether incidental asymptomatic MDs should also be resected due to the risk of tumour or malignancy.

### Single-incision versus conventional multiport laparoscopic-assisted surgery for Meckel's diverticulum in children: a single-center propensity score analysis [^114LJppa]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Meckel's diverticulum (MD) is the most common congenital anomaly of the small intestine, and can lead to various complications in children, often manifesting as abdominal pain, intestinal obstruction, intussusception, or gastrointestinal bleeding. These symptoms could indicate the presence of a complicated MD. Over the past few decades, there have been significant advancements in the field of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) for children. With the advancement of MIS techniques in pediatric care, a growing body of literature has documented the application of laparoscopy in pediatric patients with MD, and laparoscopic surgery has become the preferred method for treating such conditions.

Among the various laparoscopic techniques, single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) and conventional laparoscopic surgery (CLS) are two prevalent approaches. These approaches not only facilitate precise identification of the condition but also allow for effective laparoscopic removal of the diverticulum, thus gaining widespread acceptance in pediatric surgical practice. Previous research on SILS and CLS suggests that SILS offers notable benefits in terms of safety and postoperative recovery. However, at present, reports on SILS for treating MD are relatively scarce, and there is a noticeable lack of case series studies regarding the application of SILS in MD. Isolated cases of SILS for MD have been documented within various research contexts, including studies that explore the utilization of SILS in pediatric patients, research examining its application in segmental small bowel resections, and investigations into its role in managing obscure gastrointestinal bleeding in children.

Although SILS is increasingly favored for its cosmetically appealing incisions and faster postoperative recovery, the current literature remains relatively limited regarding its efficacy in treating MD compared with CLS. Which surgical approach is more suitable for treating MD? Does SILS offer advantages over CLS in the treatment of MD? Can SILS replace CLS for this condition? Therefore, this study aims to compare the therapeutic effects of SILS and CLS in the treatment of pediatric MD, evaluate their respective advantages and limitations, and provide a scientific basis for optimizing surgical decision-making.

### Diagnosis and management of pediatric appendicitis, intussusception, and Meckel diverticulum [^113cGDfG]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Three of the most common causes of surgical abdominal pain in pediatric patients include appendicitis, Meckel diverticulum, and intussusception. All 3 can present with right lower quadrant pain, and can lead to significant morbidity and even mortality. Although ultrasound is the preferred method of diagnosis with appendicitis and intussusception, considerable variety exists in the modalities needed in the diagnosis of Meckel diverticulum. This article discusses the pathways to diagnosis, the modes of treatment, and the continued areas of controversy.

### Emergency surgery for Meckel's diverticulum [^1126T61a]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Tumor

Tumors in Meckel's diverticulum are very rare occurrences, with incidence of only 0.5% to 1.9%. These tumors can be benign or malignant. Lipoma, Neuromuscular and vascular hamartoma are among the benign group. In the malignant group, carcinoids are the most common tumor occurring with 44% of incidence. Others are mesenchymal tumors (including gastro intestinal stromal tumors, leiomyosarcomas and peripheral nerve sheath tumors 35%), adenocarcinomas (16%) and Desmoplastic small round cell tumor.

These tumors can have various manifestations like acute abdominal pain, perforation, bleeding, intussusception and intestinal obstruction making it an emergency situation. Lipoma can be dealt with simple diverticulectomy. Since Carcinoid is associated with metastasis early in course (in 25% of cases), solitary, localized, asymptomatic nodules less than 1 cm are generally managed with diverticulectomy or segmental resection. Larger or multiple lesions require wide excision of bowel and mesentery, and hepatic resection may be required for metastatic disease.

Method of performing open diverticulectomy or segmental resection.

As stated above the treatment of symptomatic Meckel's diverticulum should be prompt surgical resection of the diverticulum or resection of segment of adjacent ileum bearing the diverticulum. Segmental ileal resection is required for the treatment of patients with bleeding because bleeding site is usually in the adjacent ileum.

After opening the abdomen either through midline or right lower incision, cecum and terminal ileum is identified. Ileum is followed proximally where we find Meckel's diverticulum approximately 2 feet from the ileocecal valve. After delivering the diverticulum with ileum into the wound, if mesodiverticulum found, it should be divided and ligated between the clamps. The lumen of diverticulum is emptied of its contents and the base is clamped with two noncrushing clamps and then excised between the clamps. Then the inner layer is stitched in full thickness with 000 vicryl in continuous manner. When this layer is complete the clamp is removed and second seromuscular layer is stitched with inverting interrupted Lembert sutures of 000 mersilk. However, this is an old procedure and trend has changed towards single extra mucosal seromuscular closure. This can be further simplified if stapling device is available. With the advent of endostapling, these procedures are now readily done using the laparoscope.

### Laparoscopic management of Meckel's diverticulum in adults [^1142Pn98]. Surgical Endoscopy (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Meckel's diverticulum is an uncommon entity. A high index of suspicion is necessary for opportune diagnosis and prompt treatment. Technetium (TC) 99m pertechnetate scintigraphy is a sensitive and specific test for Meckel's diverticulum. In adults, the scan contributes little to clinical decision making and often will not change the need for surgical intervention. We describe our experience with four patients.

Methods

Between August 2000 and August 2001, four patients were seen with Meckel's diverticula. Three were male and one was female. The mean age was 39 years (range, 18–64). Three patients presented with anemia and one with an acute abdomen. A 99mTc pertechnetate scan was performed at a cost of 900 dollars in the three anemic patients after other endoscopic and radiographic tests were nondiagnostic. Only one patient had a positive scan. All four patients underwent exploratory laparoscopy and small bowel resection. In one patient, a minilaparatomy had to be performed.

Results

All patients had a satisfactory outcome without complications. Three patients were discharged within 3 days of surgery. The remaining patient had a prolonged hospital stay because of ongoing chemotherapy for small cell lung cancer. In the three anemic patients who underwent enterectomy, ulcerated small bowel outside the diverticulum was found by the pathologist.

Conclusion

Laparoscopy is safe, cost-effective, and efficient for the diagnosis and definitive management of Meckel's diverticulum. Technetium 99m pertechnetate scintigraphy scanning adds considerable time and expense to the care of the patient without significant benefits in adults. The practice of exploratory laparoscopy rather than scintigraphy is recommended.

### Subacute Meckel's diverticulum perforation [^111uFNtf]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Meckel's diverticulum is the most common intestinal congenital defect, its prevalence is 0.2%-4.0% and it occurs more commonly in children younger than 2-year old with intestinal bleeding and abdominal pain. Perforation in the elderly is very rare with no more than 35 articles reported worldwide. Here we report the case of a 62-year-old man who was admitted to hospital with a history of acute abdominal pain with a 20-day onset. The patient was treated with laparotomy and 30cm ileal resection was performed for an 8×5cm perforated ileum tumour at 50 from ileocecal valve with a side-to-side mechanical anastomosis for reconstruction. Having morbidity Clavien-Dindo scale I in postsurgical and good outcome in 6-month follow-up. Meckel's diverticulum is an infrequent pathology in paediatric and even rarer in adult population, however, it is always important to keep in mind how to act when is seen either as a finding or as a complication.

### Multifaceted behavior of Meckel's diverticulum in children [^111KHJHy]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose/Background

Meckel's diverticulum (MD) is one of the most common congenital malformations of gastrointestinal tract in children. However, the nonspecific clinical manifestations of MD often cause a diagnostic as well as therapeutic challenge to pediatric surgeon. This study aimed to review our experience in managing this disease while evaluating the management strategies.

Methods

We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of all patients diagnosed with MD admitted to our center between January 2010 and December 2015. Factors documented including demographic criteria, clinical manifestations, preoperative examinations, surgical methods, histopathological characteristics, postoperative complications, and outcomes.

Results

The patients included 210 males and 76 females, aged from 1day to 15years. In fifty three patients, the MD was an incidental finding at laparotomy or laparoscopy. The remaining 233 patients were symptomatic and presented with various clinical features. Ninety nine patients presented with episodes of bleeding per rectum or melena. Fifty six patients demonstrated symptoms of diverticulitis or perforated MD. Forty patients were diagnosed as intestinal obstruction, and 35 patients with intussusception requiring surgical reduction. Two cases of Littre hernia and one case of foreign body trapped in MD were also observed in this group. Six patients misdiagnosed as appendicitis at another institution were reoperated in our department. Among the 99 patients with bleeding per rectum, 78 underwent a Tc-99m scan that showed a positive tracer in 55 patients and negative in 23. All patients underwent resection of the diverticulum, except for 2 cases of postponed resection. Histology revealed ectopic gastric mucosa or ectopic pancreatic tissue in 154 patients; significant differences were observed between the symptomatic group and the accidentally found group. One patient died of peritonitis and sepsis postoperatively; one case of anastomotic leak and one case of adhesive intestinal obstruction were reoperated.

Conclusion

Meckel's diverticulum has various clinical presentations and it is difficult to make a precise diagnosis preoperatively. It is necessary to maintain a high suspicion of MD in the pediatric age group with symptoms of abdominal pain, gastrointestinal hemorrhage or intestinal obstruction. Heterotopic tissue is the main cause of complicated diverticulum, and it is safe and feasible to remove the incidentally found MD. Laparoscopy should become the first choice of methods in diagnosis and treatment of MD.

### Symptomatic Meckel's diverticulum in newborn: two interesting additional cases and review of literature [^111RjYvx]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study aimed to review the literature about symptomatic Meckel's diverticulum (MD) in the neonatal period with 2 additional uncommon cases.

Methods

The authors describe 2 interesting neonatal cases of symptomatic MD and analyze the literature on this topic, with particular reference to the prevalence of sex, age at presentation, most common signs and symptoms, treatment, histology, associated anomalies, and outcome.

Results

The first patient was a term newborn with bowel obstruction by a pseudocystic MD. The second patient was a preterm infant with double perforation of the MD and ileum. Literature search for published case reports and case series on this topic reveals only 18 cases of neonatal symptomatic MD. Males are more frequently involved than females, and even preterm infants may be affected. Bowel obstruction (58.3%) and pneumoperitoneum (33.3%) are the most frequent clinical manifestation. Acute inflammation of the MD is the prominent histopathological finding (75%), although it does not seem to be related with the presence of heterotopic tissue within the MD. Surgical treatment is essential. The association of neonatal symptomatic MD with other anomalies is exceptional but is otherwise life threatening despite surgery.

Conclusions

Bowel obstruction and pneumoperitoneum are the most frequent clinical manifestations of symptomatic MD in the newborn. Surgery is required for a definitive diagnosis and successful outcome.

Conclusions

In conclusion, SILS presents distinct advantages in terms of faster recovery of bowel function, shorter hospital stays and greater patient satisfaction without an increase in postoperative complications. These findings advocate the integration of SILS into standard practice for managing MD, although further prospective studies are warranted to confirm these results and examine the long-term impact of this surgical approach.

### Emergency surgery for Meckel's diverticulum [^1134UzLz]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Complication of surgery

Complications are generally the same as that of other operations like bleeding, infection, intra abdominal abscess formation, wound dehiscence, incisional hernia and post operative adhesive intestinal obstruction. Surprisingly, morbidity (20%) and mortality (3%) of diverticulectomy in the asymptomatic group by any of these procedures have been found to be higher than morbidity (13%) and mortality (0%) in the symptomatic group. This highlights the earlier impression that these complications are the sequels of open abdominal surgery rather than of diverticulectomy. These complications have to be dealt in the similar ways as for other surgeries. But special emphasis should be given for the recurrence of bleeding which occurs when some of ectopic gastric mucosa are left behind. To prevent this, ileal resection with end-to-end anastomosis should be done to exclude all of the ectopic gastric mucosa.

### Emergency surgery for Meckel's diverticulum [^112gH7kc]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Limitation of laparoscopic surgery

Although it has been substantially proved that laparoscopic surgery is safe and efficient, having all other advantages of minimally invasive surgery, still it has some limitations. The most important one is its unavailability, this being specially true in developing countries where it also gives burden of high cost.

Another technical limitation during surgery is confrontation with either too short or very broad-based Meckel's diverticulum. If its base is too short there is danger of including too much of the ileum during stapling or leaving behind its part when it is of very broad base. Such situations can be dealt with resection of Meckel's diverticulum using a Harmonic scalpel and thereafter closing the enterotomy with intracorporeal vicryl sutures. Another safe method to accomplish excision is to exteriorize the diverticulum via a minilaparotomy incision, resection and closing the enterotomy with sutures.

Meckel's diverticulum and acquired jejunoileal diverticulosis

Meckel's diverticulum is the most common congenital malformation of the gastrointestinal tract, interesting 2% to 4% of population. It is a true diverticulum due to the persistence of omphalo-mesenteric duct, which connects in fetal life the yolk sac to the intestinal tract and usually obliterates in the 5 th to 7 th week of life. It is localized on anti-mesenteric border of the distal ileum, usually 30–40 cm far from the ileo-cecal valve. Meckel's diverticulum is lined mainly by the typical ileal mucosa as in the adjacent small bowel. However, in 20% of cases ectopic gastric mucosa may be found. Globally the incidence of complications ranges from 4% to 16%. Although there is no sex differences in the incidence of Meckel's diverticulum, its complications are 3–4 times more frequent in males. Meckel's diverticulum is the most common cause of bleeding in the pediatric age group. The risk of complications decreases with increasing age. The most frequent complications in adults are obstruction due to the intussusceptions or adhesive band, ulceration, diverticulitis and perforation. Preoperative diagnosis of symptomatic Meckel's diverticulum is difficult, especially in patients with symptoms other than bleeding. In doubtful cases, laparoscopy is the preferred diagnostic modality. However, technetium 99-m pertechnate scan is the most common and accurate non-invasive investigation, although it is specific to ectopic gastric mucosa, not to Meckel's diverticulum. In the presence of symptoms, the treatment of choice is the surgical resection. This can be achieved either by diverticulectomy or by the segmental bowel resection and anastomosis, especially when there is palpable ectopic tissue, intestinal ischemia or perforation.

Meckel's diverticulum is understood to be the commonest congenital malformation within the gastrointestinal tract with a prevalence of 2%, as found on autopsy studies. Although many cases are asymptomatic, complications can occur including haemorrhage, diverticulitis, chronic ulceration and intestinal obstruction. Intussusception is also a complication, but extremely rare. We present a rare case of Meckel's diverticulum causing intussusception, which was surgically resolved, in a 5-year-old girl. Our aim through this case report is to generate greater awareness of this complication and to provide some potential guidance towards its treatment.

### Intussusception associated with a Meckel's diverticulum and a duplication cyst [^113FbtKd]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Intussusception is a frequent cause for bowel obstructions and pediatric surgical consults. First described by Barbette in 1674, the etiology and treatment of intussusception has undergone several revisions for the last 300 years. Currently, we understand most intussusceptions in young children to be of idiopathic in nature with the incidence of pathologic lead points increasing with the age of the child. Although both Meckel's diverticulum and duplication cysts have both been reported numerous times in the past as a source of a lead point, we report, to our knowledge, the only case of both found in a child requiring operative reduction.

### Encountering Meckel's diverticulum in emergency surgery for ascaridial intestinal obstruction [^113KXzZw]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Discussion

Meckel's diverticulum is the most common congenital anomaly of the gastrointestinal tract. The occurrence of symptomatic Meckel's diverticulum in male and female has ratio of 3:1, with complications being more frequently encountered in males. Reports from autopsy and retrospective studies show incidence ranges from 0.14 to 4.5%, 4.2% of cases were asymptomatic in a study from the U.S.

A variety of surgical complications in an abdomen caused by Ascaris lumbrocoides may arise and usually occur in the children. Wandering nature of Ascaris lumbricoides after migration from their usual habitat of small intestine leads to myriad of surgical complications in the abdomen. Intestinal obstruction, biliary ascariasis, pancreatic ascariasis, hepatic abscess, gallbladder ascariasis, hepatolithiasis, appendicitis and Meckel's diverticulitis are complications associated with the abdominal ascariasis. Among them, ascaridial intestinal obstruction is the most common complication seen in the children. Mode of intestinal obstruction involves mechanical obstruction, intussusception or volvulus of small gut. Mechanical obstruction is the most frequent mode of small gut obstruction and is due to bolus of worms (Fig 3A, B & Fig 4A, B, C). Ascaridial intestinal obstruction can be manifested as partial or the complete type of small gut obstruction. In children, abdominal pain, vomiting and abdominal distension are usually present. There can be diarrhea, constipation, passage of worms with stools as well as with vomitus.

Figure 4

Management of intestinal ascariasis may involve conservative treatment or the surgical intervention to patients who do not respond to the conservative management. Plain X-ray abdomen and the ultrasonography abdomen are routinely used radiological investigations used for diagnosis. Conservative treatment implemented by application of intravenous fluids for hydration, antibiotics and use of enemas. Antihelminthics are given when patients are asymptomatic.

When deciding for for surgical intervention in ascaridial intestinal obstruction, Wani criteria were used, and are as follows:

### Optimizing surgical resection of the bleeding Meckel diverticulum in children [^115dMZUX]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

Meckel diverticula containing gastric heterotopia predispose to local hyperacidity, mucosal ulceration, and gastrointestinal bleeding in children. Eradication of acid-producing oxyntic cells is performed by either of two surgical methods: segmental enterectomy including the diverticulum or diverticulectomy only.

Methods

Retrospective review of all children having surgical resection of a Meckel diverticulum at a tertiary-referral children's hospital from 2002 to 2016 was performed. Demographic data, surgical method, pathological specimens, and outcomes were evaluated.

Results

102 children underwent surgical resection of a Meckel diverticulum during the study period. 27 (26.5%) children presented with bleeding, of which 16 (59%) had diverticulectomy only, and 11 (41%) had segmental ileal resection. All Meckel diverticula in children presenting with bleeding contained gastric heterotopia, and resection margins were free of gastric mucosa. Histologically, 19 specimens showed microscopic features of ulceration, on average 2.95mm (SD 4.49) from the nearest gastric mucosa (range: 0–16mm). Mean length of hospitalization after ileal resection was 4.0days (SD 1.2) compared to 1.6days (SD 0.9) for diverticulectomy only (p < 0.001), with no re-bleeding occurrences.

Conclusion

In the operative management of children having a bleeding Meckel diverticulum, diverticulectomy-only completely eradicates gastric heterotopia without increased risk of continued bleeding or complications and significantly shortens hospitalization.

### A single-center study of secondary intussusception in children with Meckel's diverticulum [^116S6fhi]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

There are a limited number of clinical reports addressing intussusception resulting from uncomplicated Meckel's diverticulum (MD). This paper examines the clinical characteristics and treatment strategies for intussusception secondary to MD, synthesizes clinical experiences, and offers reference value for clinicians in selecting appropriate surgical approaches. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted involving thirty patients diagnosed with intussusception secondary to MD, who underwent surgical intervention in the Department of Pediatric Surgery at Linyi People's Hospital between June 2016 and June 2025. The patients were categorized into two groups based on the presence or absence of ectopic tissue within the diverticulum: the ectopic tissue group (Group A, 10 patients) and the non-ectopic tissue group (Group B, 20 patients). A comparative analysis of the clinical data between the two groups was performed. The results indicated that Group A included six patients with ectopic gastric mucosal gland tissue and four patients with ectopic pancreatic tissue. It was observed that, in female patients with MD, the ectopic tissue predominantly originated from gastric glands, whereas in male patients, it predominantly originated from pancreatic tissue (P = 0.035). Furthermore, compared to Group B, patients in Group A exhibited a greater distance from the ileocecal valve (P = 0.006) and increased diverticulum length (P = 0.017). However, no significant differences were found between the groups concerning age, gender, clinical symptoms, or diverticulum width (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The clinical presentation of intussusception secondary to MD is atypical, necessitating surgical exploration and postoperative histopathological examination for a definitive diagnosis. The findings of this study indicate that ectopic tissue is not the primary etiological factor in intussusception secondary to MD. However, diverticula containing ectopic tissue tend to be marginally longer and are located at a greater distance from the ileocecal valve compared to those lacking ectopic tissue.

### An internal hernia caused by Meckel's diverticulum: a case report [^115EKtQ4]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

There are several reasons for development of intestinal obstruction due to Meckel's diverticulum. First, repeated inflammation can lead to the formation of adhesion bands between diverticulum and the abdominal wall or mesentery which can cause adhesive obstruction. Second, the remnant of omphalomesenteric duct in the form of adhesion band can persist connecting the Meckel's diverticulum to the umbilicus. This connecting band can precipitate intestinal torsion leading to obstruction. Third, Meckel's diverticulum can act as a lead point for the development of intussusception and intestinal obstruction. Fourth, the diverticulum can act as a nidus for bezoar formation which can cause intestinal obstruction. Occurrence of internal hernia and intestinal gangrene due to Meckel's diverticulum is rare. Therefore, in young and middle-aged patients without previous abdominal surgery, if acute intestinal obstruction occurs, internal hernia and Meckel's diverticulum should be included in the differential diagnosis. Early preoperative diagnosis is of great significance for treatment.

Preoperative diagnosis of Meckel's diverticulum is usually difficult. In most of cases, it is found during surgery. In some patients with incomplete intestinal obstruction, water soluble oral contrast study can help in making the diagnosis. However, for patients with complete obstruction, abdominal CT examination is of great significance for definitive diagnosis as seen in the current case.

Surgical excision is the treatment of choice for Meckel's diverticulum. Surgery can be done laparoscopically or by laparotomy. Diverticulectomy with or without resection of the part of the adjoining segment of intestine is required depending upon the intraoperative findings. In patients undergoing abdominal surgery with incidental finding of Meckel's diverticulum, we suggest prophylactic resection of the diverticulum if it is long, has narrow base, adhered to the adjacent abdominal wall or mesentery. But the evidence for the prophylactic resection of Meckel's diverticulum is lacking.

In conclusion, in patients with acute intestinal obstruction without previous abdominal surgery, Meckel's diverticulum and its complications should be suspected. Abdominal CT scan is of great importance for the etiologic diagnosis and treatment of intestinal obstruction. Because Meckel's diverticulum in low incidence, clinical preoperative diagnosis is very difficult. Once any complication occurs, it mostly results in surgical emergency.

### Encountering Meckel's diverticulum in emergency surgery for ascaridial intestinal obstruction [^114uG5T3]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Meckel's diverticulum is the most common congenital anomaly of the gastrointestinal tract. In children with intestinal ascariasis, the diverticulum remains asymptomatic or rarely the Ascaris lumbricoides may lead to its complications in the presence of massive intestinal roundworm load. Given that preoperative diagnosis is seldom carried out, when Meckel's diverticulum is found at laparotomy for obstructive intestinal complications of roundworm, the diverticulum should be removed as complications may occur at any time. The aim of this study was to describe the findings of concomitant presence of Meckel's diverticulum who had surgical intervention in symptomatic intestinal ascariasis in children.

Methods

A retrospective case review study of 14 children who had surgical intervention for symptomatic intestinal ascariasis having the presence of concomitant Meckel's diverticulum was done. The study was done at SMHS Hospital Srinagar, Kashmir.

Results

A total of the 14 children who had ascaridial intestinal obstruction with concomitant presence of Meckel's diverticulum were studied. Age of children ranged from 4–12 years, male:female ratio was 1.8:1. Nine patients had asymptomatic Meckel's diverticulum, whereas 5 patients with symptomatic signs were found in the course of emergency surgery for ascaridial intestinal obstruction.

Conclusion

Meckel's diverticulum in intestinal ascariasis may pursue silent course or may be accompanied with complications of the diverticulitis, perforation or the gangrene. Incidental finding of the Meckel's diverticulum in the intestinal ascariasis should have removal.

Results

1. Clinical characteristics of axial torsion of Meckel's diverticulum in our center

During the 15-year study period, approximately 1,100 symptomatic cases of MD underwent surgical treatment at our institution, of which axial torsion of the MD was identified in 12 patients, giving an incidence rate of 1.1% (12/1,100). The cohort comprised 10 males and 2 females (male-to-female ratio 5:1), with a median age of 4 years (range: 2–15 years). The most common presenting symptoms were abdominal pain (91.7%) and vomiting (75.0%), with symptom duration not exceeding three days. Laboratory analysis revealed leukocytosis in 75.0% of cases.

Surgical management included laparoscopy and laparotomy. Laparoscopy was attempted initially in eight cases, with successful completion in five, while three required conversion to laparotomy. Four patients underwent primary laparotomy. All cases underwent successful MD resection, with 2–5 cm ileal segments excised at both ends of the diverticulum. No intestinal necrosis was observed. The median distance of the MD from the ileocecal valve was 40 cm (range: 10–60 cm), and all were located at the antimesenteric border. The median diverticulum length was 6 cm (range: 4.5–10 cm), with a median width of 2.3 cm (range: 1.5–5.0 cm). The major-to-minor axis ratio was ≥ 1.5 in all cases. Torsion occurred at the diverticular base in 11 cases (91.7%) and at the mid-portion in one (8.3%). Gangrene was present in nine cases (75.0%), with torsion degrees ranging from 270° to 720°. Small bowel obstruction (SBO) was observed in 10 patients (83.3%), nine of which resulted from proximal bowel compression, while one case involved an intra-abdominal hernia secondary to MD torsion with adhesive bands forming a hernia ring (no necrosis). Congenital bands were identified in two cases (16.7%), including one omphalomesenteric band and one mesodiverticular band. The demographic, clinical, and surgical-pathological characteristics are summarized in Table 1.

### Radioguided surgery for Meckel diverticulum: nuclear medicine aspects [^112K9q39]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

We present the case of a 13-year-old boy with bleeding complications from a Meckel diverticulum (MD), which was scintigraphically confirmed. A first exploratory laparoscopy was unsuccessful in identifying the diverticulum. A new Tc-pertechnetate scintigraphy (including SPECT/CT), 3 years later, suggested the anatomical location and was helpful during the surgical exploration for the MD by radioguided surgery. Radioguidance is helpful in pathologies characterized by small size or variable anatomical location. A MD with ectopic gastric mucosa can be distinguished from the rest of the small bowel based on selective Tc-pertechnetate uptake in the gastric mucosa, with limited background activity.

### Localization and etiological stratification of non-neoplastic small bowel bleeding via CT imaging: a 10-year study [^1172n8RM]. Insights Into Imaging (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study, small bowel bleeding patients were categorized into diverticulum and non-diverticulum groups. The study compared clinical and imaging findings between the two groups and evaluated treatment strategies. Compared to the non-diverticulum group, the diverticulum group showed a higher proportion of active bleeding on CT images and surgical treatment. Therefore, enhanced CT can guide the stratified management and treatment strategy selection for non-neoplastic small bowel bleeding. Moreover, we found specific signs of diverticula on CT images: cul-de-sac termination, aiding diverticular bleeding diagnosis. Interestingly, compared to other diverticula, Meckel's diverticulum more frequently exhibits a tubular appearance.

DBE is effective for small bowel bleeding but relies on skilled physicians and patient preparation. Capsule endoscopy is used for non-emergent gastrointestinal bleeding but cannot precisely locate the bleeding source or offer interventional treatment. CT is a convenient and readily accessible imaging technique that is particularly suitable for urgent cases of gastrointestinal bleeding. Moreover, it can help identify the site and etiology of bleeding in hemodynamically stable patients with significant hemorrhage, particularly in assisting intraoperative localization of small bowel diverticular bleeding.

### Digestive hemorrhages of obscure origin [^115hNezH]. Surgical Endoscopy (2002). Low credibility.

Background

The diagnosis of digestive bleeding in some cases can require a diagnostic laparotomy when other methods have been ineffective. Video-laparoscopy can provide such cases with a certain diagnosis and the possibility of performing a simultaneous surgical treatment.

Methods

Our experience using video-laparoscopic to treat digestive hemorrhages of obscure origin involved 16 patients. The examined patients presented with the following diseases: Meckel's diverticulum (8 cases), gastric leiomyoma (1 case), small bowel leiomyoma (4 cases), jejunum leiomyosarcoma (1 case), small bowel melanoma (1 case), and Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (1 case).

Results

In all these patients the laparoscopic approach allowed us to identify the origin and site of the hemorrhages, and subsequently to treat the identified lesions. In one patient, an intraperitoneal resection of the diverticulum was performed using Endo-Gia (TM30NIF; Tyco Auto-Suture). In the remaining cases, a minilaparatomy was performed for resection of the disordered loop.

Conclusions

Video-laparoscopy is very useful for avoiding explorative laparatomies on patients affected by digestive hemorrhages of obscure origin. In these cases, the video-laparoscopic approach allows full and meticulous explorations of the small bowel to be performed, and seems to be useful for diagnosis through direct observation of the lesions. Moreover, if necessary, video-laparoscopy can be used for the effective treatment of the diseases.

Among the 2,427 cases with intussusceptions, 93.0% (2,255) were successfully reduced with an enema, and the remaining 175 cases required surgical management. In the surgical intervention group, bowel resection was required in 52 cases (29.7% of the surgical cases). The median length of hospital stay was 3 days (median: 3 days in the non-surgical group and 8 days in the surgical group).

We found that 36 patients (37 episodes) had been readmitted to the same hospital within a week after treatment of the initial intussusception (mean: 2.3 days). At the second admission, 32 cases of intussusception were successfully reduced by enema and 5 required surgery. In the surgical cases, underlying conditions were found in 2 children with polyps; none were reported to have perforation.

Secondary causes of intussusception

We found 76 (3.1%) intussusceptions due to secondary causes (Table 3). The remaining patients were thought to be idiopathic cases. Frequencies of secondary cases were 1–3% under 5 years of age, and increased thereafter. Schönlein-Henoch purpura, Meckel's diverticulum and polyps were the three major causes of the pathological lead points (PLPs) of these 76 cases. Intussusception associated with Schönlein-Henoch purpura mainly affected young children, while Meckel's diverticulum and polyps were present in children of all age groups.

### Small bowel diverticular disease: are we clinically aware? [^115sTPPV]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Small bowel diverticular (SBD) disease is often overlooked in clinical practice. Due to its discrete location and limited access, the true incidence of SBD remains unknown. Currently, many researchers have reported different clinical manifestation, treatment and complications of SBD, but has been limited to individual reports of cases studies or case series. Available cohort studies from the past were unable to highlight the advancements of small bowel diagnostic modalities, such as DBE and VCE, in recent years. The present study is one of the few that demonstrates SBD and its associated characteristics in a single cohort population, with analysis of different clinical characteristics and diagnostic approach.

A total of 149 cases of SBD were included in the present study. Majority of the patients had duodenal SBD, while jeujunal ileal SBD were rare in incidence. SBD can be asymptomatic, or associated with nonspecific abdominal discomfort, due to bacterial overgrowth. However, jejunoileal SBD are often associated with more severe clinical manifestations such as small bowel obstruction, bleeding or acute perforation. For instance, congenital small bowel diverticula like Meckel's diverticulum are frequently linked to gastrointestinal bleeding. In contrast, acquired forms, such as pseudodiverticula (false diverticula lacking full bowel wall layers), are more commonly found in the duodenum and typically present with milder symptoms, including diverticulitis or complications like bacterial overgrowth. Due to the wide range of symptoms of SBD, it is not a commonly suspected disease in clinical practice, so it is still very difficult to diagnose SBD timely and accurately. Generalized abdominal discomfort may be dismissed as functional dyspepsia, as evident in our case highlights. GI bleeding may remain inconclusive after upper and lower GI endoscopic examinations. Therefore, the diagnosis of SBD is heavily reliant on diagnostic modalities of the small bowel, preferably with direct visualization. In clinical practice, traditional methods such as small intestinal CT or BaFT are usually used to diagnose SBD, but the above methods have poor diagnostic accuracy and cannot directly show the detailed characteristics of SBD. Double balloon enteroscopy (DBE) is an examination method that can directly visualize small intestinal lesions. Compared with traditional examination methods, double balloon enteroscopy has obvious advantages such as wide field of vision and clear image, and allows for biopsy and corresponding treatment at the lesion. Due to the lengthy anatomy of the small bowel, SBD may be easily missed in radiological studies, even with small intestinal CT or BaFT. Advancements in endoscopy has allowed for increased recognition of SBD in clinical practice, which is also an important tool to help differentiate common diseases of the small bowel, such as Crohn's disease. As presented in our case highlights, Patient C may have received treatment with corticosteroids or immunomodulators given the "severity" of his disease based on CT findings. Luckily, a DBE was performed for the patient and rectified his diagnosis, which was ultimately curative with surgery. Although DBE and VCE may not be available in primary or secondary healthcare facilities, we would like to emphasize the importance of considering small bowel disease, such as SBD, especially in patients with inconclusive diagnosis. The treatment for SBD should be directed based on clinical symptoms and location of SBD. Asymptomatic small bowel diverticulosis usually does not require treatment. Although ileal SBD often require surgical intervention, due to its association with more severe clinical presentation. The purpose of treatment is to relieve symptoms and prevent complications. The use of medicine and diet control can relieve dyspepsia and anemia caused by diverticulum. For those cases that respond to supportive treatment, surgery is not recommended to prevent recurrence. Complications generally include bleeding, obstruction, and perforation, serious complications often require surgical intervention. If Meckel's diverticulum occurs during the operation as an incidental finding, the removal of Meckel's diverticulum often requires further discussion. Antibiotics can be prescribed for bacterial overgrowth, while surgery is reserved for SBD associated with severe complications. Several tertiary centers in China, with expertise in GI endoscopy and DBE, has been exploring the possibility of endoscopic resection of SBD with techniques modified from endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) and natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES). According to the Ma LL' case report, a novel technique called enteroscopic intestinal diverticulum dissection (EIDD) was proposed for the treatment of intussuscepted intestinal Meckel's diverticulum.

### A case series of Meckel's diverticulum: usefulness of double-balloon enteroscopy for diagnosis [^114x4TRz]. BMC Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Meckel's diverticulum (MD) is a congenital anomaly of the gastrointestinal tract. MD is usually located about 100 cm proximal to the ileocecal valve. Although MD is usually asymptomatic, about 2% of cases are symptomatic. Sixty percent of patients who develop complications are younger than 2 years old. Among patients with symptomatic MD, the male: female ratio is approximately 3:1.

Observation of the small intestine has become easier since the development of double-balloon enteroscopy (DBE) and single-balloon enteroscopy. The number of reports of MD observed by DBE is increasing. The present case series describes 10 patients with MD in whom DBE was useful for diagnosis.

### Cushing syndrome secondary to ectopic adrenocorticotropic hormone secretion from a Meckel diverticulum neuroendocrine tumor: case report [^1139SFgY]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

After the EAS diagnosis, both ketoconazole (400 mg/d) and sandostatin (100 μgx3/d) treatment alleviated hypercortisolism within a month (Fig 2). For the secondary diabetes mellitus, metformin (850 mgx2/d) was prescribed and a good glycaemic control was achieved. Secondary osteoporosis was treated with calcium and vitamin D (900 mg of calcium citrate with 600 IU of choleclaciferol daily).

Laparoscopic abdominal exploration revealed a 12 cm long Meckel's diverticulum with an irregular shape and a 1.8 cm nodular tumor mass (Fig. 3). Diverticulectomy with regional lymph node resection was elected, while intraoperative small bowel inspection revealed no luminal damage. Pathological analysis of the resected submucosal 1.8 cm tumour of the Meckel diverticulum confirmed a well differentiated neuro-endocrine tumour (grade I), whereas immunohistochemistry was positive for ACTH, chromogranin A and synaptophysin; Ki-67 score was < 1% (Fig. 4). There was one local metastatic lymph node.

### Localization and etiological stratification of non-neoplastic small bowel bleeding via CT imaging: a 10-year study [^117Dh8yJ]. Insights Into Imaging (2024). Medium credibility.

The diverticular group had a shorter admission-to-CT interval than the non-diverticular group, though not statistically significant (p = 0.16). However, the diverticular group had a shorter time interval from admission to endoscopy compared to the non-diverticular group (p = 0.01). Surgical treatment was performed in 41.2% of the patients (n = 68), with 33 patients with Meckel's diverticulum bleeding undergoing surgical intervention. Among 64 patients diagnosed with small intestinal bleeding via CT and treated surgically, 82.8% (53 cases) were accurately diagnosed, 10.9% (seven cases) were misdiagnosed, and 6.3% (four cases) had undetected bleeding sources by CT. Surgical intervention was administered to 83.1% (n = 49) of patients within the diverticulum group, in contrast to the predominant employment of conservative management in the non-diverticulum group (Fig. 2A). The recommended sequence of examinations is shown in Fig. 2B. The general characteristics of the study population are summarized in Table 1.

### Clinical predictors of surgical intervention for gastrointestinal magnetic foreign bodies in children [^112JPEAW]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Complications and prognosis of the ingestion of magnetic foreign bodies in the digestive tract

Complications caused by magnetic foreign bodies in the digestive tract of children frequently have a direct bearing on their treatment, hospital stay, hospital costs, and prognosis. The principal complications include mucosal edema, erosion, intestinal necrosis, perforation, bleeding, and intestinal obstruction, with gastrointestinal perforation being the most prevalent. Digestive tract perforation accounted for in this study accounts for more than 70% of surgical treatment cases. Among them, patient No. 19 was found to have Meckel's diverticulum during the operation. Upon perforation, he underwent "Meckel's diverticulum excision, gastrointestinal foreign body removal, intestinal adhesion release, enteroenteric anastomosis, and abdominal drainage", and the postoperative recovery was acceptable (Fig. 4 c). Patient No.9 showed another complicated perforation locations, the magnetic beads penetrated through the descending duodenum as well as ascending colon mesentery and located around appendix. We then performed "digestive tract foreign body removal and intestinal perforation repair" subsequently. Patient No. 23 ingested magnetic beads and button batteries by accident. Due to the high corrosiveness of button batteries, the degree of intestinal adhesion during the operation was severe, and most of the intestinal tubes were necroticwe immediately resected the necrotic intestine and performed adhesive tape loosening and intestinal anastomosis. The child developed intestinal obstruction after the surgery but gradually improved with conservative treatment. According to the prognosis survey of all children in this study, most children have been completely cured, and there were two cases of postoperative intestinal obstruction.

In conclusion, the damage caused by magnetic foreign bodies in children's digestive tracts is highly severe, so prevention is frequently preferable to treatment. Therefore, we should urge the social level to actively promote education, discourage the use of magnetic toys, and remind relevant manufacturers to create visible signs. Awaken all parents and safeguard children from contact. Medical personnel must actively adopt a treatment plan for children who have ingested by accident, prioritizing the use of gastroscope removal or gastroscope combined with laparoscopy to improve the foreign body removal rate, reduce the incidence of complications, and ensure the safety of children's lives.

### Methylphenidate hydrochloride (Relexxii) [^115MV8VX]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.7 Long-Term Suppression of Growth in Pediatric Patients

RELEXXII is not approved for use and is not recommended in pediatric patients below 6 years of age [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].

CNS stimulants have been associated with weight loss and slowing of growth rate in pediatric patients.

Careful follow-up of weight and height in pediatric patients ages 7 to 10 years who were randomized to either methylphenidate or nonmedication treatment groups over 14 months, as well as in naturalistic subgroups of newly methylphenidate-treated and nonmedication-treated pediatric patients over 36 months (to the ages of 10 to 13 years), suggests that pediatric patients who received methylphenidate for 7 days per week throughout the year had a temporary slowing in growth rate (on average, a total of about 2 cm less growth in height and 2.7 kg less growth in weight over 3 years), without evidence of growth rebound during this development period.

Closely monitor growth (weight and height) in RELEXXII-treated pediatric patients. Pediatric patients who are not growing or gaining height or weight as expected may need to have their treatment interrupted.

5.8 Potential for Gastrointestinal Obstruction

Because the RELEXXII tablet is nondeformable and does not appreciably change in shape in the GI tract, RELEXXII should not ordinarily be administered to patients with preexisting severe gastrointestinal narrowing (pathologic or iatrogenic, for example: esophageal motility disorders, small bowel inflammatory disease, "short gut" syndrome due to adhesions or decreased transit time, past history of peritonitis, cystic fibrosis, chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction, or Meckel's diverticulum). There have been rare reports of obstructive symptoms in patients with known strictures in association with the ingestion of drugs in nondeformable controlled-release formulations. Due to the extended-release design of the tablet, RELEXXII should be used only in patients who are able to swallow the tablet whole [see Patient Counseling Information (17)].

5.9 Acute Angle Closure Glaucoma

There have been reports of angle closure glaucoma associated with methylphenidate treatment. Although the mechanism is not clear, RELEXXII-treated patients considered at risk for acute angle closure glaucoma (e.g., patients with significant hyperopia) should be evaluated by an ophthalmologist.

### Management of the great mimicker: Meckel cave tumors [^112DidaH]. Neurosurgery (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Meckel cave tumors are often asymptomatic and have a sufficiently characteristic magnetic resonance imaging/computed tomography signature that allows treatment/surveillance decisions to be made without biopsy confirmation. Radiographic diagnosis requires the surgeon to be fully aware of the plethora of unusual Meckel cave lesions that mimic benign tumors when they are malignant, inflammatory, or infectious and in need of a completely different and often timely intervention. When such a diagnosis is considered, it behooves the surgeon and benefits the patient to have a percutaneous biopsy technique available.

Objective

To use our recent experience with a patient with idiopathic inflammatory sensory neuropathy and another with Meckel cave lymphoma to review the management of tumors of the Meckel cave.

Methods

The technique of percutaneous biopsy of Meckel cave tumors through the foramen ovale with biopsy needles is detailed.

Conclusion

Obtaining tissue biopsy percutaneously prevents patients with Meckel cave tumors best treated with nonsurgical management from undergoing open surgical resection with its concomitant morbidity.

### Methylphenidate hydrochloride (Concerta) [^113S7kwE]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.9 Potential for Gastrointestinal Obstruction

Because the CONCERTA tablet is nondeformable and does not appreciably change in shape in the GI tract, CONCERTA should not ordinarily be administered to patients with preexisting severe gastrointestinal narrowing (pathologic or iatrogenic, for example: esophageal motility disorders, small bowel inflammatory disease, "short gut" syndrome due to adhesions or decreased transit time, past history of peritonitis, cystic fibrosis, chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction, or Meckel's diverticulum). There have been rare reports of obstructive symptoms in patients with known strictures in association with the ingestion of drugs in nondeformable controlled-release formulations. Due to the controlled-release design of the tablet, CONCERTA should be used only in patients who are able to swallow the tablet whole [see Patient Counseling Information (17)].

5.10 Hematologic Monitoring

Periodic CBC, differential, and platelet counts are advised during prolonged therapy.

5.11 Acute Angle Closure Glaucoma

There have been rare reports of angle closure glaucoma associated with methylphenidate treatment.

Although the mechanism is not clear, CONCERTA-treated patients considered at risk for acute angle closure glaucoma (e.g., patients with significant hyperopia) should be evaluated by an ophthalmologist.

5.12 Increased Intraocular Pressure and Glaucoma

There have been reports of an elevation of intraocular pressure (IOP) associated with methylphenidate treatment [see Adverse Reactions (6.5)].

Prescribe CONCERTA to patients with open-angle glaucoma or abnormally increased IOP only if the benefit of treatment is considered to outweigh the risk. Closely monitor CONCERTA-treated patients with a history of abnormally increased IOP or open angle glaucoma.

5.13 Motor and Verbal Tics, and Worsening of Tourette's Syndrome

CNS stimulants, including methylphenidate, have been associated with the onset or exacerbation of motor and verbal tics [see Adverse Reactions (6.2, 6.5)]. Worsening of Tourette's syndrome has also been reported.

Before initiating CONCERTA, assess the family history and clinically evaluate patients for tics or Tourette's syndrome. Regularly monitor CONCERTA-treated patients for the emergence or worsening of tics or Tourette's syndrome, and discontinue treatment if clinically appropriate.

The incidence of Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) continues to increase. Understanding of MCC biology has advanced rapidly, with current staging providing valuable prognostic information. MCC treatment often is multidisciplinary. Surgery remains an important component in the staging and treatment, most commonly involving wide excision of the cancer and sentinel lymph node biopsy. Lymphadenectomy is used to treat nodal disease. Radiotherapy enhances locoregional control and possibly survival. Systemic therapies, in particular novel immunotherapies, may be promising in the treatment of advanced or recurrent and metastatic disease.

Introduction

Despite the longtime prevalence of diverticulitis as one of the most common gastrointestinal diseases in both the inpatient and outpatient setting, its etiology, prevention, and treatment remain hotly contested. Once viewed as a disorder of primarily older people in western populations, diverticulitis has rapidly increased its presence in all age groups worldwide, prompting researchers to reexamine the pathophysiology of the disease process. Clinicians continue to push the envelope with novel approaches to management, from avoiding antibiotics for uncomplicated cases to identifying subsets of patients with complicated diverticulitis who may not require an operation. Here, we review the most recent literature on a wide array of topics in diverticulitis, with an emphasis on publications within the last 5 years.

The objectives of therapy in patients who develop acute diverticulitis include the treatment of symptoms, the colonic infection, the prevention of complications and the recurrence of the condition(Table 3). Based on the severity of symptoms, ability to tolerate oral intake, presence of comorbidities and adequate outpatient support, the decision on whether patients should be hospitalized or receive ambulatory care should be carefully considered. Treatment of complications may require interventional radiology or surgery.

Purpose and use of these guidelines

These guidelines are evidence-based, with the grades of recommendation based on the evidence. They do not represent the standard of practice, but are suggested plans of care, based on best available evidence and a consensus of experts. They do not exclude other approaches as being within a standard of practice. The treating clinician should determine the most appropriate action, after taking into account conditions at the relevant medical institution (staff levels, experience, equipment, etc.) and the characteristics of the individual patient. The responsibility for the management and outcome rests with the engaging practitioners, and not the consensus group.

3.5 Interventions, Survival, and Prognosis

The management of MCC necessitates a multimodal approach, integrating surgical resection, radiotherapy, immunotherapy, and systemic chemotherapy based on disease stage, tumor burden, and patient‐specific factors. Localized MCC is primarily treated with surgery, often supplemented by adjuvant radiotherapy to improve locoregional control, whereas metastatic or unresectable disease is best managed with immune checkpoint inhibitors, which have largely supplanted chemotherapy due to superior efficacy and durability of response. However, chemotherapy remains a consideration in select scenarios, such as rapid cytoreduction in symptomatic disease or in combination regimens for refractory cases. As treatment strategies evolve, optimizing therapeutic selection requires balancing oncologic control, toxicity profiles, and functional outcomes. The following sections provide a detailed analysis of each modality, with emphasis on comparative efficacy, indications, and emerging therapeutic synergies.

Figure 2 provides a structured management algorithm for MCC, illustrating evidence‐based therapeutic pathways tailored to disease stage, extent of nodal involvement, and metastatic status.

3.5.1 Surgery

Surgical intervention remains a cornerstone in the management of primary MCC, with approaches designed to optimize local control while preserving cosmetic and functional outcomes. Historically, surgical intervention for localized MCC has demonstrated a 5‐year overall survival (OS) rate of approximately 50%, decreasing significantly to around 35% when regional nodes are involved, and further decreasing to 14% with distant metastases. Wide Local Excision (WLE) and Mohs Micrographic Surgery (MMS) represent the two primary strategies, each offering distinct benefits based on patient‐specific and tumor‐specific factors.

WLE is recommended with margins of 1–2 cm to ensure adequate clearance of malignant cells, particularly in high‐risk areas. However, surgery alone may be insufficient for cases with perineural invasion, lymphovascular involvement, or positive margins. As surgery does not address residual microscopic disease, a multimodal approach incorporating adjuvant radiotherapy is often necessary to improve local control and reduce recurrence in 80%–90% of cases within the first 2 years following initial treatment. Recurrence typically occurs early, with a median time between 7 and 9 months post‐treatment.

### Gastroesophageal reflux: medical and surgical treatment… [^115ggqK6]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

Antireflux surgery now is being offered to more patients, primarily because recovery is quicker with the newer, laparoscopic approach. Yet, patient selection for surgery remains problematic. Some data suggest that the best surgical outcome is in patients whose symptoms responded completely to PPI therapy. 3 Patients with atypical and refractory symptoms are less likely to have a favorable surgical outcome than are those with heartburn and regurgitation, which are well controlled by medical therapy.
4. 6 However, surgical therapy does have some downsides. Increasing information suggests that many, if not most, surgically treated patients end up taking reflux medications at some point.

For example, long-term follow-up in a group of patients randomized to receive medication or surgery found that after 10 years, 92 percent of the patients randomized to medical therapy were still taking medication, and 62 percent of the patients initially treated with surgery were again taking antireflux medications.
7. The introduction of endoscopic techniques for controlling reflux generated a great deal of excitement. Radiofrequency application is designed to increase the reflux barrier of the lower esophageal sphincter. At one-year follow-up, most patients in the first cohort treated with this technique reported improvement of symptoms, but 34 percent were again taking PPIs, and an additional 38 percent were regularly taking antacids. 12 Results on one 13 of the two approved endoscopic sewing techniques also have been reported.

Six months after treatment, 62 percent of the 64 patients in the initial report were no longer taking PPIs, although few patients had normalization of esophageal acid exposure. 13 Finally, early data 14 on a new endoscopic technique suggest an improvement in symptoms and medication usage after injection of a biopolymer into the lower esophageal sphincter; however, only 38 percent of patients had normalization of esophageal acid exposure on follow-up testing. Choosing patients for endoscopic or surgical treatment remains something of a paradox. Patients who respond fully to PPIs appear to be the best candidates, but one wonders how advisable it is to subject well-controlled patients to the morbidity and potential mortality of these more invasive treatments. Some patients who are refractory to medical therapy will benefit from surgery, but there are no clear data to help predetermine which patients will benefit most.

### Surgical treatment for asymptomatic cholelithiasis… [^113KdHCe]. AAFP (2014). Low credibility.

Clinical Question When is surgery indicated in patients with asymptomatic cholelithiasis. Evidence-Based Answer Surgery should not be offered to patients with asymptomatic cholelithiasis. Cholecystectomy may be beneficial for patients who are at high risk of biliary cancer, infection, or other complications, including younger patients and those with choledocholithiasis, sickle cell disease, gallstones larger than 3 cm, or significant immunosuppression. 1 Compared with emergent cholecystectomy, elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy has lower rates of complications and conversion to open cholecystectomy. Case series and cohort studies indicate that complications of laparoscopic cholecystectomy — although rare — include potentially severe bleeding, abscess, bile leak, common bile duct injury, and bowel injury. 6, 7. Patients who are at high risk of biliary cancer and other operative or disease-related complications may be offered prophylactic cholecystectomy if the benefits of surgery outweigh the risks of observation. 1, 5, 9 Patients with asymptomatic choledocholithiasis have a much higher risk of severe complications and should be offered prophylactic cholecystectomy. 1 All patients should be counseled about the symptoms of biliary colic, because most severe gallstone-related complications are preceded by these symptoms.

1. Recommendations from Others A 1992 consensus statement from the National Institutes of Health, 9 updated by the Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons in 2010, 10 recommends that almost no asymptomatic patients undergo cholecystectomy.

Those at high risk of gallbladder cancer, myocardial infarction, and other complications — especially patients with sickle cell disease or hereditary spherocytosis, children, and those receiving immunosuppressive therapy or undergoing transplant — may benefit from surgery.

### Skin excision and osteophyte removal is not required in the surgical treatment of digital myxoid cysts… [^111t7MK1]. JAMA Network (2005). Excellent credibility.

The flap was designed to include the posterior nail fold down to the distal interphalangeal joint. The matrix was incised longitudinally at the site of maximum nail dystrophy. The DMC is visible at the base of the incision. C, The cystic structure was removed by curettage. The base of the space occupied by the cyst can be visualized. D, After tourniquet removal, hemostasis was achieved using bipolar diathermy and the flap was resited and sutured into place. E, Appearance 2. 5 years postoperatively. However, the injection of methylene blue into the DIPJ is difficult and time-consuming. Based on this understanding of the cause of DMCs, we have used a surgical technique to treat DMCs without the need for skin excision. Herein, we have adapted the technique and demonstrated that precise leakage point identification is not required for treatment success, thus reducing the potential postoperative morbidity, reducing the operative time, and simplifying the surgical technique.

In an earlier study, 5 it was shown that identification of the DIPJ leakage site using methylene blue injection into the DIPJ and division of the connection between the cyst and the joint resulted in cure of the digital cyst in 94% of finger and 57% of toe cysts. The principle objectives of successful surgery are debated. Some researchers4 believe that cyst removal is required. Others6 believe that osteophytes on the adjacent DIPJ have to be removed to ensure therapeutic success. One study5 has proposed that any procedure that results in the DIPJ leakage point being sealed over by fibrosis following a surgical or destructive procedure is likely to be successful. Many other treatments have been advocated for the treatment of DMCs. This and previous studies demonstrate why such a large range of therapeutic maneuvers is successful. Any surgical or destructive therapy that causes scarring resulting in the leakage site being sealed over will be successful.

Dermatologists have used needling, 7 cryotherapy, 8, 9 infrared photocoagulation, 10 laser destruction, 11 and curettage. These procedures result in local tissue destruction and scarring. Skin excision and subsequent coverage of the defect with a local flap also produces good results. 12 The present and past studies5 demonstrate that excision and flap closure works simply because the area between the cyst and the DIPJ is disrupted and subsequently scars over, sealing the leakage point.
