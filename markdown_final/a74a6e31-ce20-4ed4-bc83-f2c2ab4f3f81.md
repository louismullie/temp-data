## Question

Pancolitis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about pancolitis, specifically seeking a comprehensive overview that covers its definition and classification within ulcerative colitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining pancolitis and its classification within ulcerative colitis. Then, I should verify epidemiology and risk factors, including pediatric and PSC-associated phenotypes. Next, I will review clinical presentation and complications, followed by diagnostic evaluation and endoscopic-histologic mapping. After that, I need to examine disease course and prognosis, including progression and colectomy risk. Then, I will outline management principles for induction, maintenance, and refractory disease, including special populations. Finally, I should confirm surveillance strategies for dysplasia and cancer, and close with a concise synthesis and key takeaways anchored in guidelines and high-quality evidence.

> Let me first confirm the definition and classification so I don't misstate the construct. Pancolitis denotes extensive ulcerative colitis involving the entire colon from rectum to cecum, typically categorized as E3 in the Montreal classification, and it is the most severe extent category within UC, which otherwise spans proctitis, left-sided colitis, and extensive colitis including pancolitis [^115AZoZK] [^113tmsFD].

> I should double-check epidemiology before drawing conclusions. Pancolitis accounts for roughly 20% to 40% of UC cases in adults, whereas in children the proportion is substantially higher, with reports approaching 74% to 80% presenting with pancolitis or extensive disease, reflecting a more severe phenotype at onset in pediatrics [^114KW9LJ] [^113tmsFD] [^1147LA1v]. Hold on, I should verify PSC associations as well; PSC-IBD carries a markedly higher pancolitis rate, around 68% to 83% in pediatric cohorts and up to 94% in some adult series, with a characteristic right-to-left inflammatory gradient and frequent backwash ileitis, which I will revisit shortly [^1176dx9r] [^115jETV8].

> Next, I will examine risk factors and modifiers, but I need to be cautious not to over-attribute causality. Disease extent at diagnosis is the strongest predictor of progression, with left-sided disease more likely to extend to pancolitis than proctitis, and pediatric-onset disease carries higher risks of extensive disease and complications, including PSC and malignancy over time [^116uo1aC] [^114VtfSb] [^111KPHPo]. Wait, let me verify the PSC linkage; PSC is more common with pancolitis than limited colitis, and the PSC-IBD phenotype often shows rectal sparing and backwash ileitis, though heterogeneity exists across cohorts, so I should frame these as associations rather than absolutes [^1121vgPx] [^115jETV8].

> I will now review clinical presentation and complications to ensure I capture severity signals. Pancolitis typically manifests with frequent bloody diarrhea, urgency, tenesmus, abdominal pain, systemic inflammatory features, and a higher risk of severe complications such as toxic megacolon, massive hemorrhage, and perforation, which mandate urgent inpatient management and surgical consultation when present [^114mqsro]. Hold on, I should verify malignancy risk; longstanding pancolitis confers a markedly elevated colorectal cancer risk, with 25-year cumulative risks of neoplasia and advanced neoplasia substantially higher than in limited colitis, and PSC further amplifies this risk, necessitating structured surveillance programs [^1163NFVc] [^1134PZmd].

> Let me consider the diagnostic approach and make sure I don't skip essential steps. Full ileocolonoscopy with intubation of the terminal ileum and systematic biopsies is required to define extent, confirm UC versus Crohn's disease, and detect backwash ileitis or atypical distributions such as rectal sparing in PSC-IBD; flexible sigmoidoscopy alone is insufficient for initial mapping in suspected pancolitis [^115AZoZK] [^11422gtz]. I should confirm infection exclusion; stool studies for C. difficile and other enteric pathogens are mandatory at diagnosis and during flares to avoid missing treatable infections that can mimic or exacerbate UC [^115AZoZK].

> Next, I should review endoscopic and histologic mapping so sampling is adequate. In pancolitis, obtain at least 33 four-quadrant biopsies every 10 cm from cecum to rectum, and consider every 5 cm in the left colon given higher dysplasia yield; when available, chromoendoscopy with targeted biopsies improves dysplasia detection and is preferred over random biopsies alone [^111fFa9i] [^111tGqrq]. Wait, let me verify backwash ileitis; it occurs in up to 20% to 25% of pancolitis and is characterized by a short segment of mild, continuous terminal ileal inflammation without stricturing, and importantly does not preclude restorative proctocolectomy with pouch or worsen pouch outcomes, so I should not overcall it as Crohn's disease in an otherwise typical UC phenotype [^112Wpkax] [^116vyytp].

> I need to check disease course and prognosis to set expectations. Pancolitis is associated with more frequent relapses, shorter time to relapse, higher hospitalization risk, and greater colectomy risk compared with limited disease; population data show pancolitis increases early colectomy odds several-fold, and even in remission cohorts, pancolitis tends to relapse earlier than distal disease [^116qgF4m] [^116yPZAf]. But wait, what if disease appears quiescent endoscopically in PSC-IBD; despite milder symptoms, the inflammatory burden may be underestimated, and the malignancy risk remains elevated, reinforcing the need for vigilant surveillance and histologic sampling even when macroscopic activity appears limited [^114XxtZk].

> Now, I will outline management principles, and I should confirm alignment with contemporary guidelines. For induction in moderate-to-severe pancolitis, systemic corticosteroids are appropriate short-term therapy, but early introduction of advanced therapies with proven efficacy is recommended to achieve steroid-free remission and reduce colectomy risk; options include anti-TNF agents, vedolizumab, ustekinumab, and tofacitinib, selected based on disease severity, extent, comorbidities, and patient preferences [^113Ueo4a] [^114WGKGs]. Hold on, I should verify thiopurine positioning; thiopurines have modest efficacy for maintenance after steroid-induced remission but are not reliable for induction in moderate-to-severe UC, so they are best used as maintenance adjuncts or in selected cases rather than primary induction in pancolitis [^111xt2pr] [^1177GTrt].

> Let me think about maintenance and treat-to-target monitoring so I don't miss safety checks. Maintenance should be steroid-free and guided by clinical response, endoscopic remission targets, and biomarkers such as fecal calprotectin and CRP; reassessment at 6 to 12 weeks after induction is standard, with escalation if targets are not met to prevent cumulative damage and complications [^111rGK88] [^115AZoZK]. I should confirm that flexible sigmoidoscopy can sometimes substitute for full colonoscopy in monitoring pancolitis; indeed, left-sided histology and endoscopy have excellent accuracy for detecting pancolonic remission in active pancolitis, supporting the use of sigmoidoscopy for interval monitoring when full mapping is not required [^111QEKUn].

> For refractory disease, I need to ensure rescue strategies are timely. Intravenous corticosteroids are first-line for acute severe UC, with early consideration of infliximab or cyclosporine as rescue therapy if there is no improvement within 3 to 5 days. Colectomy should not be delayed when medical rescue fails or complications arise, as delays increase morbidity and mortality [^113Ueo4a]. Wait, let me verify real-world signals. Analyses of tofacitinib programs and observational cohorts reinforce that extensive disease and prior anti-TNF failure identify patients at higher colectomy risk, underscoring the need for aggressive, early optimization rather than prolonged steroid exposure [^1155Rd22] [^116yPZAf].

> Special populations require tailored approaches, so I should review pediatric and PSC-IBD nuances. In children, pancolitis predominates and VEO-IBD is common, so early use of biologics and careful attention to growth, bone health, and immunization schedules are essential. PSC-IBD warrants annual colonoscopic surveillance from the time of PSC diagnosis given markedly elevated CRC risk, and MRCP-based hepatobiliary assessment is indicated when cholestasis is present, with surveillance intervals individualized in prepubertal children due to extremely low CRC incidence under age 12 [^114VtfSb] [^1176dx9r] [^1134PZmd]. Hold on, I should verify the surveillance cadence; yes, PSC-IBD generally merits yearly colonoscopy after diagnosis, with deferral in very young children individualized to risk factors and disease severity [^1134PZmd] [^111Frgxt].

> I should confirm cancer surveillance protocols and biopsy technique so recommendations are actionable. Begin dysplasia surveillance 8 years after disease onset in pancolitis, risk-stratify intervals using validated criteria, and prefer chromoendoscopy with targeted biopsies; if chromoendoscopy is unavailable, perform high-quality white-light colonoscopy with extensive random biopsies, including at least 33 four-quadrant samples in pancolitis and denser sampling of the left colon, with escalation to annual intervals for PSC, active inflammation, pseudopolyps, prior dysplasia, or family history of CRC [^1134PZmd] [^1174QAwQ] [^112Jb8cu]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost said surveillance starts at diagnosis for all; that would conflate PSC with average-risk UC — surveillance in non-PSC pancolitis begins at 8 years, whereas PSC-IBD warrants immediate annual surveillance from diagnosis, which I should explicitly distinguish to avoid confusion [^1134PZmd] [^1174QAwQ].

> Let me reconsider the key takeaways to ensure internal consistency with the evidence. Pancolitis is the most extensive UC phenotype, carries higher risks of complications and colectomy, and requires aggressive, early induction with advanced therapies to achieve steroid-free remission. Diagnosis hinges on complete ileocolonoscopy with systematic biopsies, surveillance demands structured dysplasia programs with chromoendoscopy when feasible, and special populations such as children and those with PSC require intensified monitoring and individualized therapy sequencing to mitigate long-term risks [^113Ueo4a] [^115AZoZK] [^1134PZmd].

Pancolitis is **extensive colonic inflammation** involving the entire colon from rectum to cecum, most often due to ulcerative colitis [^115AZoZK] but also seen in Crohn's disease, infections, ischemia, and drug-induced colitis. Diagnosis requires **colonoscopy with biopsies** [^115AZoZK] to confirm extent and exclude other causes, and disease severity guides therapy. Management is stepwise: 5-ASA for mild disease [^111buywL], corticosteroids for flares [^1129YJSU], and thiopurines, anti-TNFs, vedolizumab, ustekinumab, or tofacitinib for moderate-to-severe or refractory cases [^113Ueo4a]. Pancolitis carries higher risks of complications, including toxic megacolon, colorectal cancer, and colectomy, so **regular surveillance** [^1134PZmd] and early escalation are critical [^113Ueo4a].

---

## Etiology and associated conditions

Pancolitis most commonly reflects **ulcerative colitis (UC)** [^114mqsro], a chronic immune-mediated colitis with continuous mucosal inflammation extending proximally from the rectum. Other causes include:

- **Crohn's disease**: Less common but can involve the entire colon with transmural, segmental inflammation [^1178yYxd].
- **Infectious colitis**: Clostridioides difficile, E. coli O157:H7, and other pathogens can cause diffuse colitis [^1177dR4z] [^115R3hVE].
- **Ischemic colitis**: Severe ischemia can produce diffuse colonic injury, occasionally presenting as pancolitis [^115yDqVT].
- **Drug-induced colitis**: Immune checkpoint inhibitors and other agents can cause diffuse colonic inflammation [^1149jcjz].

---

## Clinical presentation

Patients typically present with:

- **Diarrhea**: Frequent, often bloody [^115AZoZK].
- **Abdominal pain**: Cramping or persistent discomfort [^115XvGnG].
- **Urgency and tenesmus**: Common due to rectal involvement [^115XvGnG].
- **Systemic symptoms**: Fever, weight loss, fatigue, and malaise in moderate-to-severe disease [^notfound].
- **Severe complications**: Toxic megacolon, massive hemorrhage, and perforation can occur [^notfound].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Accurate diagnosis and staging require **endoscopic and histologic confirmation**:

- **Colonoscopy with biopsies**: Gold standard to define extent, severity, and exclude alternative diagnoses [^115AZoZK].
- **Histopathology**: Continuous mucosal inflammation, crypt distortion, basal plasmacytosis, and goblet cell depletion support UC [^11422gtz].
- **Laboratory tests**: CBC, CRP, ESR, and stool studies to exclude infection [^115AZoZK].
- **Imaging**: CT or MRI for severe disease or complications (e.g. toxic megacolon, abscess) [^notfound].

---

## Medical management

Management is **tailored to severity and activity**, aiming for steroid-free remission and mucosal healing [^113Ueo4a]:

| **Severity** | **Induction therapy** | **Maintenance therapy** |
|-|-|-|
| Mild | - 5-ASA (oral ± rectal) [^111buywL] | - 5-ASA [^115TyGXe] |
| Moderate | - Oral corticosteroids [^1129YJSU] <br/> - 5-ASA [^111buywL] | - Thiopurines (azathioprine, 6-MP) [^111xt2pr] <br/> - Or 5-ASA if steroid-responsive [^115TyGXe] |
| Severe/refractory | - Anti-TNF agents (infliximab, adalimumab) [^116yRNVy] <br/> - Vedolizumab <br/> - Ustekinumab <br/> - Tofacitinib | - Same agents as induction <br/> - Or thiopurines if steroid-dependent [^111xt2pr] |

---

## Surgical management

Surgery is indicated for **refractory disease**, **complications**, or **dysplasia/cancer**:

- **Indications**: Acute severe colitis unresponsive to medical therapy, toxic megacolon, massive hemorrhage, perforation, dysplasia, or colorectal cancer [^notfound].
- **Procedures**: Total proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) is the standard elective operation; subtotal colectomy with ileostomy for acute emergencies [^notfound].
- **Outcomes**: IPAA provides good functional results but carries risks of pouchitis, infertility, and sexual dysfunction [^notfound].

---

## Complications

Pancolitis is associated with **significant complications**:

- **Toxic megacolon**: Life-threatening dilation requiring urgent surgery [^notfound].
- **Colorectal cancer**: Increased risk with longstanding disease; surveillance colonoscopy is essential [^1134PZmd].
- **Extraintestinal manifestations**: Arthritis, uveitis, erythema nodosum, pyoderma gangrenosum [^notfound].
- **Colectomy**: Higher risk than limited disease, especially in severe or refractory cases [^1155Rd22].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis varies with disease severity, response to therapy, and complications. Pancolitis has higher risks of relapse, hospitalization, and colectomy than limited disease, but **early, aggressive therapy and close monitoring** improve outcomes [^115iw5RW] [^116yPZAf] [^113Ueo4a] [^111rGK88].

---

## Follow-up and surveillance

Regular follow-up is essential to monitor disease activity, medication adherence, and complications. Colonoscopic surveillance for dysplasia and cancer should begin 8 years after diagnosis, with **annual colonoscopy for high-risk patients** (e.g. PSC, prior dysplasia) [^1134PZmd].

---

Pancolitis is extensive colonic inflammation with significant morbidity; **early diagnosis, severity-based medical therapy, and timely surgery** when indicated, along with structured surveillance, are key to optimizing outcomes.

### The role of endoscopy in inflammatory bowel disease [^111WpDyy]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2015). Medium credibility.

AGA 2010 — colorectal cancer surveillance in inflammatory bowel disease: Eligible patients include ulcerative colitis (UC) with left-sided or extensive colitis and Crohn's disease (CD) colitis involving at least 1/3 of colon; ideally, surveillance colonoscopy should be performed when colon disease is in remission. Screening is for all patients at 8 y with multiple biopsy specimens obtained throughout the entire colon to assess the true microscopic extent of inflammation. The optimal surveillance interval is not defined; after 2 negative examinations, surveillance recommended every 1–3 y, and patients with histories of colorectal cancer (CRC) in a first-degree relative, active inflammation, or anatomic abnormalities may benefit from more frequent surveillance examinations. Technique recommendations state that representative biopsy specimens from each anatomic section of the colon are recommended and one study recommended that a minimum of 33 biopsy specimens be taken in patients with pancolitis; chromoendoscopy with targeted biopsies is considered an acceptable alternative to white light endoscopy for endoscopists with experience. Comments note that patients with ulcerative proctitis or ulcerative proctosigmoiditis are not considered at increased risk for IBD-related CRC and may be managed with average-risk recommendations, and that patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) should begin surveillance colonoscopy at the time of diagnosis, then yearly.

Ulcerative colitis — treatment assessment and sequencing principles state that any treatment that is selected and administered to a patient with UC should be assessed at a defined time point (6–12 weeks) to confirm its efficacy and safety, and a disease monitoring strategy should be incorporated to identify secondary nonresponse and allow subsequent adjustment in treatment to prevent complications and additional morbidity; choice of second-line therapy is dictated by similar principles, taking into account the initial therapy used; and patients with concomitant inflammatory arthritis may benefit from use of anti-TNF or JAK inhibitor therapies, while patients with concomitant inflammatory skin conditions such as psoriasis, including those who develop inflammatory skin conditions while receiving anti-TNF therapy, may benefit from IL-23 based strategies.

### Risk factors and long-term outcome of disease extent progression in Asian patients with ulcerative colitis: a retrospective cohort study [^115iw5RW]. BMC Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this study has the largest sample size to present disease extent progression in Asian patients with UC. We have shown that in a Chinese cohort of UC cases, one in six UC patients experienced E1 to E2/E3 or E2 to E3 disease extension, and one in four patients with limited UC experienced disease extension to extensive colitis, after 7.5 years of follow-up. Only disease extent at diagnosis was identified as a clinical predictor for disease extension. Progression to extensive colitis resulted in a increased therapeutic requirements.

According to a recent retrospective study aiming to evaluate the natural disease course between pancolitis and non-pancolitis E3, pancolitis was associated with higher probabilities of cumulative relapse or hospitalization. In the present study, we further classified E3 lesion based on hepatic flexure as well and found that, of patients diagnosed with E3, patients with pancolitis were associated with increased treatment requirements. Specifically, 38(33.3%) initiated steroids and 14(12.3%) initiated immunosuppressive agents in the 114 patients with pancolitis during the follow-up, whereas 16 (26.7%) initiated steroids and 6(10%) initiated immunosuppressive agents in the 60 patients with non-pancolitis E3.

Previous estimates of disease extension have varied between one-fifth to one-third of patients with E1 or E2 showed disease extension to E3. According to a recent meta-analysis, approximately one quarter of patients with limited UC demonstrated disease extension over time with most extension occurring during the first 10 years. Disease extension may occur anytime after initial diagnosis with 31.1% within the first decade. In our study, 91 (17.6%) had disease extension during a median follow-up of 7.5 years. The median time for any progression of disease extent was 16.1 months (IQR: 8.3–42.2 months). The cumulative rate of disease extension was 9.9, 14.9, 19.6, 24.6 and 30.5% at 1–5 year post-diagnosis, which was comparable to that of previous studies.

### ACG clinical guideline update: ulcerative colitis in adults [^113Ueo4a]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Ulcerative colitis in adults — conclusions outline disease characterization and management, noting that UC is an idiopathic chronic inflammatory condition of the recto-colon and colon with variable activity and severity and significant morbidity. Appropriate management involves successful induction of both clinical and endoscopic remission followed by use of a corticosteroid-free maintenance strategy and ongoing monitoring for disease and drug-related complications. Choice of therapy is based on activity, severity, extent of inflammation and prognostic factors, and may include oral, topical (rectal), or systemic therapies, as well as surgery. Patients with moderate-to-severe disease should be treated early in their disease course with therapies that have been shown to be effective and should not linger with suboptimal therapy or recurrent courses of corticosteroids. In general, the induction therapy selected drives the choice of maintenance therapy. Positioning considerations include a single head-to-head trial in moderately to severely active UC, separation of induction and maintenance strategies for some patients with ASUC, and considerations of comorbid or concomitantly existing extraintestinal manifestations. We advocate for preservation of the clinician-patient shared decision-making approach to therapy selection and exclusion of limitations imposed by third-party payers.

### Long-term course and prognostic factors in pediatric ulcerative proctitis: a multicenter cohort study [^1147LA1v]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Ulcerative colitis (UC), an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), has become more prevalent among children worldwide in recent years. Ulcerative colitis is classified by the extent of lesions as ulcerative proctitis (UP, E1); left-sided UC (E2), distal to the splenic flexure; extensive UC (E3), distal to the hepatic flexure; and pancolitis (E4), proximal to the hepatic flexure. Although UP is considered mild colitis because inflammation is localized, it causes frequent diarrhea, bloody stools, tenesmus, and abdominal pain, impacting the quality of life for affected children. A greater proportion of children than adults with UC have a severe course, with 74% having pancolitis at diagnosis. Only 5%-9% of children with UC have only UP at diagnosis, representing a less common UC presentation than in adults.

First-line therapies for UP in adults include topical 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA); topical steroids or 5-ASA plus oral steroids may be required. Refractory proctitis, defined as resistance to these treatments, requires intensification to thiopurine or biologics. Proximal disease extension of UP occurs in 30% of adults, frequently requiring immunosuppressive treatment. Recently, concern has arisen about the exclusion of UP from randomized clinical trials of biologic and small molecule agents in patients with moderate to severe UC. Clinical data concerning treatment options are particularly limited for refractory UP; recommendations for management of moderate to severe UP are largely extrapolated from data based on extensive UC. To address this problem, the International Organization for Study of Inflammatory Bowel Disease has issued a consensus statement standardizing methods for patient evaluation in UP trials. A 2023 study reported the efficacy of tofacitinib in adults with UP, and studies are increasingly focusing on UP.

Although UP treatment is progressing in adults, data concerning natural history and treatment is sparse for children. European Crohn's and Colitis Organization guidelines suggest that topical 5-ASA may be effective in children with mild to moderate UP, but since children face greater risk of disease extension oral medications should be added; however, detailed recommendations are not given. Few reports have even described the natural history of pediatric UP. In this study, we investigated clinical course, therapy, and characteristics of refractory UP in children.

### ACG clinical guideline: primary sclerosing cholangitis [^1121vgPx]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2015). Medium credibility.

Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) epidemiology — prevalence in ulcerative colitis (UC) and population estimates are described as follows: the prevalence of PSC in UC is estimated at ~5%, a Swedish UC cohort of 1,500 found 5% with elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP) with PSC confirmed in 55 patients (3.7%), and PSC was more common in men and pancolitis than left-sided colitis or proctitis (5.5% vs 0.5%). Among Asian and Southern European populations with PSC, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) prevalence is estimated at 30%–50%, and in the United States PSC prevalence is estimated to be 1 to over 16 per 100,000.

### The role of endoscopy in inflammatory bowel disease [^1174QAwQ]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2015). Medium credibility.

ECCO — Ulcerative colitis (UC) surveillance includes screening all patients 6–8 y after onset of symptoms to reassess disease extent, then risk-stratifying by 4 criteria (1 point each: pancolitis, endoscopic or histologic evidence of active inflammation, pseudopolyps, and family history of CRC) to set intervals: Every 1–2 y for high-risk patients (3–4 points) and every 3–4 y for low-risk patients (0–2 points), with increasing the interval if no evidence of intraepithelial neoplasia or endoscopic and/or histologic inflammation is present in 2 consecutive surveillance colonoscopies (eg, from every 1–2 y to every 3–4 y). Chromoendoscopy with targeted biopsies is the surveillance procedure of choice for appropriately trained endoscopists; alternatively, random biopsies (4-quadrant biopsies every 10 cm) and targeted biopsies of any visible lesion should be performed if white light endoscopy is used. Comments include PSC with annual surveillance at time of diagnosis, that proctitis does not require regular monitoring, and that good bowel preparation is essential with repeat colonoscopy considered if fecal residue is present.

Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2007). Medium credibility.

Differentiating UC from CD in children and adolescents — algorithm branch decisions: If there is "diffuse continuous superficial inflammation of the colon beginning at the anus and extending proximally, WITHOUT endoscopic or histologic evidence of ileal inflammation", classify as "Probable ulcerative colitis without backwash (subclassify into proctitis, left sided colitis, and pancolitis)". If not, assess for "diffuse pancolitis with superficial mucosal inflammation of the ileum identified by endoscopy or histology? (Upper GI series demonstrates a normal caliber ileum with a widely patent ileocecal valve)" and, if present, label "Probable ulcerative colitis with backwash (typically occurs in patients with pancolitis)". Then evaluate whether features "that raise the question of Crohn's disease and are uncommonly seen in ulcerative colitis (e.g. absolute rectal sparing, growth failure, 'focal active gastritis')" are present; if yes, follow "1. Classify as indeterminate colitis for now. 2. Carefully document the feature in the evaluation that raises diagnostic uncertainty. 3. Repeat diagnostic evaluation in the future to attempt to classify patient more definitively". If these features are absent, the terminal classification is "Ulcerative colitis".

### Management of IgG4-related disease [^114V4Uzx]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2019). High credibility.

IgG4-related disease was unrecognised as a unified disease entity until this century, yet in a short period of time the disease has been appreciated to have a worldwide distribution, and its clinical, pathological, and radiological features have been described in considerable detail. The disease has strong organ predilections, and many of the clinical presentations of disease are increasingly familiar to both generalists and specialists. Early recognition of IgG4-related disease is crucial because although the disease is highly treatable, it can lead to serious organ damage and even death if undiagnosed until advanced stages. Its indolent nature often makes diagnosis challenging, and IgG4-related disease is one of the great mimickers of other diseases in the current era. Glucocorticoids are an effective treatment for IgG4-related disease, but their long-term use is problematic in a disease that frequently affects middle-aged to elderly individuals and often leads to pancreatic dysfunction. Our understanding of the pathophysiology of the disease is surprisingly advanced given the relatively recent recognition of this condition. Insights into disease pathophysiology offer the possibility of a variety of targeted treatment approaches. Looking ahead, biological therapies could profoundly alter the way in which IgG4-related disease is managed, permitting the use of specific therapies that are tailored to patients' clinical phenotypes.

### Management of paediatric ulcerative colitis, part 1: ambulatory care-an updated evidence-based consensus guideline from the European society of paediatric gastroenterology, hepatology and nutrition and the European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation [^1176dx9r]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

The IBD phenotype in patients with PSC also seems different compared to classic UC or CD. Colitis in PSC‐IBD is characterised by extensive inflammatory distribution, with highest signs of active inflammation in proximal colon that decrease towards the rectum, even with rectal sparing. High pancolitis rates (68%–83%) but low rates of proctitis (2%–4%) have been reported. Backwash ileitis, endoscopic and/or histologic inflammation of distal ileum in patients with pancolitis, has been described also as one of the classical IBD phenomena in PSC.PSC, that may precede IBD onset by years but also occur after colectomy, may progress to liver cirrhosis, ultimately necessitating liver transplantation. UC patients with PSC have a greater risk of malignancies such as CRC and cholangiocarcinoma (8%–30% of UC patients with long‐standing PSC). However, CRC in paediatric UC before age 12 years is extremely rare. As PSC is associated with more extensive disease, the theoretical cancer risk is higher than in limited colitis, but the clinical course is usually milder. The higher colectomy rate in these patients in older ages is mainly secondary to dysplasia and CRC. Older age at PSC diagnosis increases the risk of colonic neoplasia. Targeted biopsies aimed at abnormal areas identified by newer colonoscopic techniques (chromoendoscopy, confocal endomicroscopy) are recommended. The optimal follow‐up method is still debatable. In a multicentre report of 781 children with PSC (4277 person‐years of follow‐up), overall event free survival was 70% at 5 years and 53% at 10 years but PSC‐IBD was associated with a favourable prognosis; cholangiocarcinoma occurred in 1%. In another registry, median time to complications was similar in both paediatric and adult cohorts. A recent study evaluating 82 paediatric IBD patients with sclerosing cholangitis (31% female; mean age at diagnosis 11.9 ± 2.8 years), followed up for a mean of 6.8 ± 3.3 years, suggested that children have better clinical outcomes than previously reported, particularly if diagnosed early. The authors recommend prompt assessment for PSC, including liver biopsy and biliary imaging, when liver function abnormalities are detected.MRCP remains the most appropriate imaging modality for diagnosing PSC in children. A pattern of irregular bile ducts, with zones of narrowing and dilatation, is characteristic of PSC.

Case presentation

This is the case of a middle-aged man who presented with diarrhoea, abdominal cramps, lethargy, loss of appetite and weight loss for the past 12 days. He denied recent antibiotic use or travel to forests, lakes or abroad; however, he did eat out frequently. Medical, family and drug history was unremarkable. On inspection, he looked pale and sick but was oriented to time, place and person. He was feverish (38.4°C), with a respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, but was otherwise vitally stable. Peripheries were cold and he appeared dehydrated. Abdominal examination revealed tenderness and guarding in the left lower quadrant and hyperactive bowel sounds. No per rectal bleed was noted. All other systemic examinations were unremarkable.

### Diagnosis and treatment of autoimmune pancreatitis [^111r3rhh]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Clinical management of autoimmune pancreatitis changed over the last years. The lack of high-quality studies, probably due to the relative rarity of the disease, has not fully clarified many diagnostic and therapeutic aspects. Aim of this review is to overview the literature from a clinical point of view, focusing on diagnostic and therapeutic approach to this complicated disease.

Recent Findings

They have been focused mainly on the risk of misdiagnosing a cancer. Many significant articles have been published on the treatment strategies of autoimmune pancreatitis, considering both induction and maintenance therapy.

Summary

Diagnosis of autoimmune pancreatitis remains challenging, particularly in focal pancreatic involvement, despite recent advances on imaging modalities. Treatment is based on induction and maintenance phases. Steroid treatment remains the best option to induce remission. Maintenance therapy may be used to prevent disease relapses, and low-dose steroids, azathioprine or rituximab are the therapeutic options. However, it remains unclear which patient needs to be treated.

### Extent of disease affects the usefulness of fecal biomarkers in ulcerative colitis [^113TfJUW]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Results

Patients characteristics

Patients (n = 133) who fulfilled the criteria for UC were enrolled, and colonoscopies were performed with fecal biomarker examination a total of 162 times. There were no adverse events related to colonoscopy in any of the 133 patients. According to the Montreal classification, 61 patients (46%) were diagnosed with pancolitis, 48 patients (36%) with left-sided colitis, and 24 patients (18%) with proctitis. The total number of colonoscopies included 79 (49%) for pancolitis, 58 (36%) for left-sided colitis, and 25 (15%) for proctitis. The number of patients with clinical activity (LI ≥ 4) was 25 (42%), 19 (39%), and two (13%) for pancolitis, left-sided colitis, and proctitis, respectively. The number of patients with MES ≥ 2 was 28 (36%) for pancolitis, 25 (43%) for left-sided colitis, and five (20%) for proctitis, respectively. With respect to medications for UC, there were no proctitis patients who received systemic corticosteroid, immunomodulators, oral tacrolimus, tofacitinib, or biologics (Table 1).

### Oral vancomycin is associated with less therapy intensification in adults with symptomatic inflammatory bowel disease and underlying primary sclerosing cholangitis [^117KFAMz]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Seventy percent of patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), a cholestatic liver disease, have comorbid inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Typically, comorbid symptomatic IBD in PSC is a milder phenotype of ulcerative colitis (UC), characterized by pancolitis, rectal sparing and ileitis. Since PSC is associated with alterations in the gut microbiome, antibiotics are postulated to be beneficial in treatment. While no proven therapy for PSC exists, oral vancomycin therapy (OVT) has received considerable interest, without demonstrating a clear benefit in PSC outcomes. Therefore, recent guidelines concluded that there was insufficient evidence to recommend OVT for the treatment of PSC. Notably, the guidelines did not address the role of OVT in the treatment of symptomatic comorbid IBD in patients with PSC (IBD-PSC).

Recent data in pediatric IBD-PSC patients show that OVT is associated with a higher likelihood of IBD clinical and endoscopic remission — although associations with IBD therapy changes, including therapy de-escalation, were not directly studied. It is not yet clear whether this association also holds in adult IBD-PSC patients, who can have different response rates to IBD therapy than pediatric patients; to date, the majority of data on OVT in adult IBD-PSC patients are from case reports. We hypothesized that OVT would similarly be associated with a better IBD disease course in adults with IBD-PSC. We studied whether OVT was associated with differences in IBD disease activity, as assessed by the need for IBD therapy intensification, in adult patients with IBD-PSC.

### Interference with the lower gut-liver axis induces remission of primary sclerosing cholangitis in a patient with ulcerative colitis [^115uoJEt]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2018). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The mechanism of pathogenesis in PSC remains poorly understood and this is reflected in the limited treatment options in clinical practice. Current animal models of PSC remain suboptimal, and to date, there is not a single animal model that displays all attributes of the disease seen in humans. Well-designed longitudinal studies offer alternative means to identify causative microorganisms, however, the lack of a biomarker in early disease, low prevalence of the disease and poor accessibility of the biliary tree restrict the conduct of such studies. Observational studies such as case control and association studies, though do not demonstrate causality, still provide important information and have contributed to much of our understanding of PSC.

Similarly, this case report describes a series of longitudinal observations in a patient over a 9-year period including the evolution and behaviour of the disease; from the diagnosis of UC, to the development of PSC and pyoderma gangrenosum, and subsequently the effects of partial and complete "knock out" of the lower GI tract by subtotal colectomy and total proctectomy. It is noteworthy that there are several distinct PSC-IBD phenotypes; the majority are patients with PSC-UCwith backwash ileitis, rectal sparing disease or pancolitis. In this particular case, the patient suffered from pancolitis with rectal involvement. It was severe, treatment-resistant pancolitis that was the indication for her colectomy, and there was little clinical evidence to suggest backwash ileitis before or after her surgery. Interestingly, the remission of PSC described in this case is preserved up until today, 7 years following proctectomy. Our observations suggest that the complete remission of PSC was successfully achieved through interference of the lower gut–liver axis, and notably, only after removal of the rectum. This suggests pathogens within the rectum may also contribute to pathogenesis and disease activity of PSC.

Classification of "PSC-IBD"

As previously mentioned, IBD in PSC is different phenotypically from classic UC or CD alone, and many have coined "PSC-IBD" as a unique phenotype, even though no clear immunophenotype difference exists. This typically presents as pancolitis with worse endoscopic disease in the right colon, and has mild inflammation histologically, with some skip lesions. In CD-like disease, the extent is more commonly colonic or ileocolonic, and isolated ileal disease is rare. In UC-like disease, an active inflammation that decreases more distally with eventual rectal sparing, as well as the occurrence of backwash ileitis, are considered typical in PSC-IBD. However, owing to the poor definition consensus of either backwash ileitis or rectal sparing, too many studies have found mixed results for these findings to be truly considered pathognomonic.

Patients with PSC-IBD often have discrepancies between the location and severity of histopathologic and endoscopic inflammation, necessitating histopathology sampling in all quadrants of the colon and the terminal ileum. Inflammatory histopathology changes are predominantly mild-to-moderate and worse in the right colon. Both right-sided disease and mild histo-endoscopic findings have been postulated to correlate with lesser clinical symptoms in patients with PSC-IBD compared to IBD alone.

Small-duct PSC

Small-duct PSC, historically called pericholangitis, is a rare subtype of PSC, representing 3.6% of all PSC cases. It shares the demographic, laboratory and histopathologic findings of large-duct PSC, but the radiological findings are absent or inconsistent with PSC. Small-duct PSC is more prevalent in PSC patients with CD compared to those with UC or without IBD (28% vs. 3%). Conversely, a systematic review noted that large-duct PSC patients had a higher prevalence of IBD (odds ratio [OR] 2.57, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.03–3.25) and UC (OR 4.51, 95% CI 1.22–16.71) than small-duct PSC patients. Small-duct PSC patients had markedly better survival than large-duct PSC: in 1 study, no patient developed CC or liver-related death, but a few still developed CRC. It is worth noting that up to 55% of patients with small-duct PSC may develop cholangiographic evidence of large-duct PSC with time.

### Clostridium difficile pancolitis in adults with cystic fibrosis [^117NZ6Qt]. Journal of Cystic Fibrosis (2008). Low credibility.

We report three cases of Clostridium difficile pancolitis in adults with cystic fibrosis (CF) in whom the presenting symptoms were atypical. All three required treatment with systemic steroids, in addition to oral vancomycin and metronidazole to achieve resolution of the colitis. This experience suggests that C. difficile colitis should be considered in individuals with CF presenting with non-specific abdominal symptoms.

### Hepatic issues and complications associated with inflammatory bowel disease: a clinical report from the NASPGHAN inflammatory bowel disease and hepatology committees [^114e589E]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2017). Medium credibility.

Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) — PSC is a chronic, progressive, cholestatic liver disease characterized by inflammation and fibrosis of the intra- and extrahepatic bile ducts with multifocal biliary strictures, and it is rare in the general pediatric population with an incidence and prevalence of 0.2 and 1.5 cases per 100,000 children, respectively. The majority of PSC cases appear concurrently with IBD, particularly ulcerative colitis (UC). In children with IBD, PSC is most commonly cited as 4% or less, but rates of PSC in IBD are 10% to 25% in population-based series, with longer follow-up or with screening by liver biopsy and/or cholangiography regardless of symptoms. Intestinal inflammation in a patient with PSC may represent a unique phenotype termed PSC-IBD that is characterized by more frequent pancolitis with rectal sparing and a higher incidence of backwash ileitis; in Crohn disease with PSC, colitis is more likely than ileitis. The IBD activity of PSC-IBD may be less severe with a lower rate of colectomy, yet patients with PSC-IBD have a much greater risk of colorectal carcinoma and a worsened overall survival compared with patients without traditional UC, and pouchitis is more common in PSC-IBD after colectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis surgery. Diagnosis of PSC is based on a cholestatic serum biochemical profile with characteristic changes on liver histology.

### The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons clinical practice guidelines for the management of Clostridioides difficile infection [^1177dR4z]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2021). High credibility.

Clostridioides difficile infection — radiologic evaluation and CT performance: Radiologic evaluation has limited utility in the setting of CDI. Grade of recommendation: Weak recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 2C. The ability for CT scanning to predict the need for surgical intervention is poor (sensitivity 52%–85% and specificity 48%–92%), and in fact, about 40% of patients with CDI have a normal CT scan without radiographic evidence of colitis. A retrospective review of 176 hospitalized patients with CDI found abnormal wall thickening, pancolitis, and bowel dilation on CT associated with colectomy, with wall thickening an independent predictor of 30-day mortality; however, these findings had a low predictive value of 50%.

### RISE-MX, a real-world study of patients with moderate / severe inflammatory bowel disease returning for hospital follow-up in Mexico: baseline demographics and clinical characteristics, treatment and disease status [^116yRNVy]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

For the medical treatment of UC, the First Latin American Consensus of PANCCO recommends a step-up approach. Mild/moderate cases are initially managed with 5-ASA and corticosteroids. The concomitant use of azathioprine works as a corticosteroid sparing agent. In moderate/severe UC, biologic therapies are recommended to induce and maintain remission in patients who do not respond to conventional treatments irrespective of whether the patient is dependent or refractory to corticosteroids. On the other hand, for CD, the treatment strategy is planned according to phenotype and risk factors. Mild/moderate cases are initially managed with corticosteroids as induction therapy. In patients with moderate/severe CD who do not respond to initial treatment, immunomodulators such as azathioprine and methotrexate are considered. Biologic therapies play an important role in inducing and maintaining remission in refractory or severe CD. In both UC and CD, treatment decisions are individualized based on disease severity, patient characteristics, and response to previous therapies. Regular monitoring and close follow-up are essential to assess treatment efficacy and adjust the therapeutic approach as needed, to achieve and maintain remission, improve the quality of life, and prevent disease complications and long-term adverse effects. The AGA guide for medical management in CD suggests the early use of biologic therapy with or without an immunomodulator rather than delaying their use until after the failure of 5-ASA. Indeed, systematic reviews showed no convincing benefits of 5-ASA over placebo either in the induction of remission or in the maintenance of medically induced remission in CD. In Mexico, clinical recommendations allow the use of 5-ASA for the induction and maintenance of clinical remission just for mild UC patients, and recently for mild CD patients. Our results showed that 5-ASA has been used in a great part of CD patients in Mexico, highlighting that treatment could be improved in this population as guidelines suggest. These statements are important to consider when making decisions relating to the clinical management of patients with CD to help optimize treatment outcomes and decrease disease burden.

### Primary sclerosing cholangitis and inflammatory bowel disease comorbidity: an update of the evidence [^114XxtZk]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Comorbid primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) represent a unique disease phenotype with a different risk profile than PSC or IBD alone. While the pathogenetic mechanisms behind both diseases remain unclear, recent studies have targeted several immune-mediated pathways in an attempt to find a potential therapeutic target. Patients with PSC-associated IBD typically exhibit pancolitis with a right-to-left intestinal inflammatory gradient associated with a greater incidence of backwash ileitis and rectal sparing. Although there is an increased incidence of pancolitis in this population, bowel symptoms tend to be less significant than in IBD alone. Likewise, the degree of inflammation and symptoms of PSC-associated IBD are characteristically less clinically significant. Despite the relatively quiescent clinical presentation of PSC-associated IBD, there is an increased risk for colorectal and hepatobiliary malignancy making vigilance for malignancy essential.

### Ulcerative colitis practice guidelines in adults: American College of Gastroenterology, practice parameters committee [^113nqycR]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Guidelines for clinical practice are aimed to indicate preferred approaches to medical problems as established by scientifically valid research. Double-blind placebo controlled studies are preferable, but compassionate-use reports and expert review articles are used in a thorough review of the literature conducted through Medline with the National Library of Medicine. When only data that will not withstand objective scrutiny are available, a recommendation is identified as a consensus of experts. Guidelines are applicable to all physicians who address the subject regardless of specialty training or interests and are aimed to indicate the preferable but not necessarily the only acceptable approach to a specific problem. Guidelines are intended to be flexible and must be distinguished from standards of care, which are inflexible and rarely violated. Given the wide range of specifics in any health-care problem, the physician must always choose the course best suited to the individual patient and the variables in existence at the moment of decision. Guidelines are developed under the auspices of the American College of Gastroenterology and its Practice Parameters Committee and approved by the board of trustees. Each has been intensely reviewed and revised by the Committee, other experts in the field, physicians who will use them, and specialists in the science of decision analysis. The recommendations of each guideline are therefore considered valid at the time of composition based on the data available. New developments in medical research and practice pertinent to each guideline will be reviewed at a time established and indicated at publication to assure continued validity. The recommendations made are based on the level of evidence found. Grade A recommendations imply that there is consistent level 1 evidence (randomized controlled trials), grade B indicates that the evidence would be level 2 or 3, which are cohort studies or case-control studies. Grade C recommendations are based on level 4 studies, meaning case series or poor-quality cohort studies, and grade D recommendations are based on level 5 evidence, meaning expert opinion.

### Endoscopic mucosal tissue sampling [^111tGqrq]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2013). Medium credibility.

Endoscopic mucosal tissue sampling — colonoscopy in pancolitis and dysplasia detection — Chromoendoscopy by using methylene blue or indigo carmine with targeted biopsies is recommended when expertise in this technique is available, with additional biopsy samples of all colonic segments to stage the extent of inflammation. A meta-analysis reported an incremental yield of 7% (95% CI, 3.2–11.3), with a number needed to treat of 14 patients to detect 1 additional patient with dysplasia or cancer, and no study has compared the yield of high-definition colonoscopy with high-definition chromoendoscopy. When chromoendoscopy is not available or complete evaluation is precluded, random mucosal sampling with targeted biopsies of any suspicious-appearing lesions remains a reasonable alternative. In patients with documented pancolitis, biopsy specimens should be obtained in a 4-quadrant fashion every 10 cm from the cecum to the rectum for a minimum of 33 total random mucosal samples, and because of an increased risk in the rectum and sigmoid, sampling every 5 cm in the distal colon should be considered. All lesions that appear endoscopically resectable should be removed in their entirety, with biopsy specimens of the flat mucosa surrounding the resection site obtained to ensure that the lateral margins are free of dysplasia, and the endoscopically removed lesion and the flat mucosa sample from the surrounding the resection site should be placed in separate containers. In patients who have undergone total proctocolectomy with ileal pouch–anal anastomosis who have symptoms consistent with pouchitis, endoscopy with biopsy is indicated, both the pouch and the afferent small-bowel limb should be carefully evaluated, and any abnormalities of the afferent small bowel should undergo biopsy to evaluate for the possibility of Crohn's disease.

### Risk factors for neoplasia in inflammatory bowel disease patients with pancolitis [^1163NFVc]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives

Colorectal cancer (CRC), developing from dysplastic lesions, is the main long-term complication of pancolitis. The aims of the present study were to assess the risks for neoplasia and advanced neoplasia (AN), respectively, in ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) patients with pancolitis, and to search for protective and risk factors for colorectal neoplasia.

Methods

A total of 855 inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients with longstanding pancolitis (276 UC, 56 IBD unclassified (IBDu), and 523 CD) had pathological examination of a proctocolectomy specimen (n = 255) or multiple biopsy samples from a surveillance colonoscopy (n = 600) after median disease duration of 115 months. Risk factors for low-grade dysplasia (LGD) and AN, respectively, were searched for in the whole group of patients and in a case-control comparison after matching for IBD phenotype.

Results

A total of 75 patients eventually developed colorectal neoplasia: 14 adenomas, 28 nonadenomatous LGD, and 33 ANs. The 25-year cumulative risks for neoplasia and AN, respectively, were 32.8 ± 5.7% and 25.9 ± 5.7% in UC and IBDu vs. 12.1 ± 2.7% and 3.9 ± 2.0% in CD (P < 0.0001). In CD, patients with UC-like endoscopic appearance (n = 126) had an increased risk for AN compared with those with discrete lesions (at 25 years, 10.6 ± 7.2 vs. 1.5 ± 0.9%). In the case-control comparison, factors associated with an increased risk of AN were primary sclerosing cholangitis (hazard ratio (HR) 4.72 (1.54–14.52)) and family history of CRC (HR 3.37 (1.02–11.14)), whereas previous segmental colectomy was protective (HR 0.25 (0.07–0.88)).

Conclusions

The risk of AN in longstanding pancolitis is higher in UC or IBDu than in CD. In CD, this risk is significantly increased in patients with UC-like endoscopic lesions. The surveillance program should focus on these latter patients.

### The role of endoscopy in inflammatory bowel disease [^1134PZmd]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2015). Medium credibility.

ASGE inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) colorectal cancer surveillance — Eligible patients include ulcerative colitis (UC) left-sided or extensive colitis and Crohn's disease (CD) involving at least 1/3 of colon; ideally, surveillance colonoscopy should be performed when colon disease is in remission. Screening is specified as all patients at 8 y, with restaging biopsies. Surveillance is every 1–3 y; optimal surveillance interval not defined, and the presence of risk factors merits annual surveillance, including active inflammation, anatomic abnormality (stricture, multiple pseudopolyps), history of dysplasia, family history of colorectal cancer (CRC) in a first-degree relative, and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). Recommended technique states chromoendoscopy with pancolonic dye spraying and targeted biopsies is sufficient for surveillance in IBD; consider 2 biopsies from each colon segment for histologic staging, or random biopsies with targeted biopsies of any suspicious lesions as a reasonable alternative if chromoendoscopy is not available or its yield is reduced by significant underlying inflammation, pseudopolyposis, or poor preparation. For pancolitis, 4-quadrant biopsies every 10 cm from cecum to rectum, for minimum of 33 biopsies; if no pancolitis, 4-quadrant biopsies every 10 cm are limited to the greatest extent of involvement documented by any colonoscopy. Additional comments state that the extent of colon involvement should be defined by the greatest extent documented by any colonoscopy, isolated proctitis does not confer increased risk of IBD-related CRC, and patients with PSC should begin surveillance colonoscopy at the time of diagnosis, then yearly.

### Efficacy and safety of tacrolimus in refractory ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease: a single-center experience [^116sej4v]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Background

The published experience regarding the use of tacrolimus in Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) refractory to more commonly used medical therapy has been fairly limited. Our objective was to describe our experience with its use in a cohort of patients which, to our knowledge, represents the largest North American cohort described to date.

Methods

This was a retrospective, single-center chart analysis. Patients were identified by compiling all hospital discharges with principle diagnoses of ICD-9 codes for 555.0–555.9 (regional enteritis) and 556.0–556.9 (ulcerative colitis) from January 1, 2000, to October 31, 2005, and then cross-referencing the electronic charts for tacrolimus serum concentrations ordered during this time period. Additional patients were identified through verbal communication with participating clinicians. Information abstracted included proportion with clinical response and remission (using a modified disease activity index), ability to wean from steroids, need for surgery / time to surgery, and side-effect profile.

Results

In all, 32 UC patients and 15 CD patients were identified. The mean disease duration was: UC 81 months (range, 1 month to 37 years), CD 100 months (range, 1 month to 35 years). The disease distribution for UC was: pancolitis 12 (37.5%), extensive colitis 6 (18.8%), left-sided 11 (34.4%), and proctitis 3(9.4%). For CD this was: TI 2 (13.3%), small bowel 2 (13.3%), colonic 3 (20.7%), ileocolonic 7(46.7%), and perianal 1 (6.7%). The duration of tacrolimus treatment for UC was mean, 29 weeks. For CD it was mean, 9.9 weeks. In all, 30/32 UC and 7/15 CD patients were on steroids; 4/30 UC and 0/7 CD patients were able to subsequently wean off steroids. In all, 12/32 UC patients proceeded to colectomy. Mean time to colectomy was 28 weeks and 6/15 CD patients proceeded to a resective surgery. The mean time to surgery was 22 weeks. In all, 22/32 UC patients achieved a clinical response; 3/32 achieved remission and 8/15 CD patients achieved a clinical response; 1/15 achieved remission. Adverse reactions were generally mild. In 6 patients the drug had to be discontinued because of an adverse reaction. There were no opportunistic infections identified, no cases of renal insufficiency related to drug administration, and no deaths while on the medicine.

Conclusions

Our experience with tacrolimus in UC and CD indicates that it is safe and relatively well tolerated, although its clinical efficacy is quite variable. More prospective studies assessing its use are necessary.

### Management of paediatric ulcerative colitis, part 1: ambulatory care-an updated evidence-based consensus guideline from the European society of paediatric gastroenterology, hepatology and nutrition and the European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation [^111KPHPo]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

A recent survey of Dutch paediatric gastroenterologists demonstrated profound variability in paediatric dysplasia surveillance practice, including perceived indication, surveillance interval and endoscopic approach, with 70% expressing need for clearer guidance. There is no doubt that paediatric‐onset IBD is an established lifetime risk factor for CRC. Meta‐analysis data, from five population‐based studies comprising 283,540 patient years, showed a 2.4‐fold increased risk of all cancers with paediatric IBD (pRR: 2.46, 95% CI: 2.06–2.93), with particularly high risk of CRC (pRR: 20.29, 95% CI: 15.90–25.90). A Scandinavian cohort study also yielded high estimates of CRC for UC pancolitis [36.3 (95% CI: 22.8–57.8)].

However, cancer associated with paediatric‐onset IBD usually presents in early adulthood. A recent analysis of Danish and Finnish population registry data showed a median age of CRC diagnosis to be 26.2 years (23.1–31.1) with a median time from IBD to cancer diagnosis of 11.1 years (9.4–16.4). Similarly, a Korean data set demonstrated that all but one CRC associated with IBD occurred at least 8 years after diagnosis.

Disease duration, PSC and VEO‐IBD may confer risk for the onset of dysplasia within childhood. A Swedish nationwide cohort study (1964–2014, N = 346) described 5 IBD‐associated CRCs diagnosed before the age of 18, with higher incidence after 10 years of follow‐up, and all cases occurring after 5 years of follow‐up. A cohort of 509 patients with PSC‐IBD diagnosed in childhood, with a median age of diagnosis of 13.2 years (9.3–15.6), showed a risk of dysplasia or cancer of 2.8 cases per 1000 patient years, with 5 and 10 years probability of CRC of 0.8% (95% CI: 0.3%–2.7%) and 4.8% (95% CI: 2.0%–11.1%), respectively. Of the eight cases of dysplasia or CRC, four were in patients with very early‐onset IBD.

### Real-world persistence of successive biologics in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: findings from ROTARY [^112ddpAS]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Adjusted analysis of each biologic demonstrated some variables that significantly impacted the rate of switching or discontinuation for some first- and second-line biologic treatments for patients with UC (Supplementary Tables 9 and 10). Baseline disease extent other than pancolitis was associated with a significantly higher rate of switching or discontinuation for patients receiving infliximab as a first-line biologic. At the second line of biologic treatment, patients of a race or ethnicity other than White or Caucasian who were receiving adalimumab had a significantly lower rate of switching or discontinuation. Increasing age and duration of conventional therapy at baseline of 91 days or above resulted in a significantly lower rate of switching or discontinuation for patients who were receiving infliximab, while disease extent other than pancolitis significantly increased the rate of switching or discontinuation for patients receiving vedolizumab.

3 Ulcerative colitis

3.1 Diagnosis

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disease characterised by mucosal inflammation starting distally in the rectum, with continuous extension proximally for a variable distance, often with an abrupt demarcation between inflamed and non-inflamed mucosa. Typically, patients with UC experience periods of relapse and remission. Up to 90% will have one or more relapses after the first attack, and early relapse or active disease in the first 2 years is associated with a worse disease course subsequently.

Statement 1. Where ulcerative colitis is diagnosed by sigmoidoscopy, we recommend a full ileocolonoscopy to delineate disease extent, severity of inflammation and to exclude Crohn's disease (GRADE: strong recommendation, very low-quality evidence. Agreement: 100%).

In patients presenting with suspected UC, stool cultures and Clostridium difficile toxin assay should always be performed to rule out infective causes. While UC is often initially diagnosed at flexible (or rigid) sigmoidoscopy, it is important to confirm the diagnosis, extent and severity of disease by means of full ileocolonoscopy, usually within the first year, as this can more definitively confirm the diagnosis of UC versus Crohn's disease and give information that may help to predict future disease course, including potential and risk stratification for dysplasia, and thus will influence treatment choices. For histological assessment at least two biopsy specimens should be taken from five sites throughout the examined bowel, including the ileum and rectum, during the initial endoscopic evaluation.

Rectal sparing in UC has been described in up to > 3% of patients, but more frequently patchy inflammation of the rectum may be seen in those who have been given empirical topical therapy. The presence of a 'caecal patch', isolated peri-appendiceal inflammation and backwash ileitis can occur in UC, but if the histology and clinical pattern are not otherwise typical of UC, then small bowel evaluation is required to exclude Crohn's disease (see Section 4.1.3.1: Crohn's disease, Cross-sectional imaging: CT, MR and small bowel ultrasound). Backwash ileitis has been reported in up to 20% of patients with extensive colitis.

3.1.1 Histology

No histological feature is diagnostic of UC, but the combination of basal plasmacytosis, diffuse crypt atrophy and distortion, villous surface irregularity and mucus depletion are suggestive of a diagnosis of UC in the correct clinical context. Uneven distribution of inflammation within the colon or within biopsies can occur in patients with long-standing disease, or after treatment.

### Primary sclerosing cholangitis and inflammatory bowel disease comorbidity: an update of the evidence [^115jETV8]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

The data regarding the chronology of presentation for PSC-IBD are also heterogeneous. Most data indicate that IBD typically precedes PSC, with a median time interval of 10 years. In contrast, other studies have noted an increased incidence of PSC after colectomy in IBD patients. Furthermore, there are also reports of IBD appearing many years after the diagnosis of PSC, or even after orthotopic liver transplantation. Given this uncertainty, clinicians should remain vigilant for PSC-IBD in patients with known PSC or IBD.

The distribution of disease and the degree of endoscopic inflammation seen in PSC-IBD set it apart from IBD alone. Multiple studies have demonstrated an increased incidence of pancolitis among patients with PSC-UC compared to UC-only patients. In a study of almost 400 patients with PSC-IBD, Boonstra et al reported that 94% of the PSC-UC patients had pancolitis, compared with only 62% in the matched UC-only cohort (P < 0.001). Although the distribution of colitis appears to be more diffuse, the clinical course in PSC-IBD appears to be less severe. Several studies note that PSC-IBD patients require fewer steroid equivalents and fewer hospital admissions than their IBD counterparts. Backwash ileitis and rectal sparing are two characteristics initially thought to be more prevalent in PSC-IBD than in IBD alone. However, significant heterogeneity found in recently pooled data calls this claim into question. The mild degree of macroscopic, endoscopic inflammation may underestimate the degree of rectal inflammation, leading to the appearance of increased rectal sparing in PSC-IBD. Further investigation into the macroscopic disease characteristics, such as backwash ileitis and rectal sparing, are clinically relevant, as they may aid in pattern recognition and diagnosis.

### Long-term outcomes of autoimmune pancreatitis: a multicentre, international analysis [^114iBNxd]. Gut (2013). Low credibility.

Treatment regimens

A wide variety of steroid regimens were employed for induction and maintenance of remission. For the initial dose of steroids, all centres used either a weight-based strategy (0.6 mg/kg/day of prednisolone) or fixed-dose regimen (30–40 mg/day) that were roughly equivalent for treatment of a 70 kg individual. Tapering strategies ranged from 5–10 mg decrease every 1–2 weeks. All Asian centres (n = 10) used a maintenance strategy of low-dose (2.5–5 mg/day) prednisolone, which was continued for anywhere from 6 months to 3 years. In general, the European and North American groups tapered the steroids off within 3 months and did not provide maintenance doses of steroids. Multiple centres elected to use immunomodulator drugs instead of low-dose steroids for maintenance therapy (n = 5). In the four centres treating more than five subjects with this strategy, azathioprine (2 mg/kg/day) was the preferred agent and was used for a variable duration of time (1–3 years).

Many patients initially underwent surgery either due to the absence of typical features of AIP or clinical presentation prior to the recognition of AIP as a disease entity. Surgeries were performed for resection of mass-forming lesions (ie, pancreaticoduodenectomy or distal splenectomy) or palliative bypass (ie, gastrojejunostomy) for those with an apparently unresectable cancer. Surgery was not intentionally performed as primary treatment for AIP. A number of patients were treated conservatively, without the use of steroids or surgery. Supportive care was provided for a variety of reasons including asymptomatic disease, severe comorbid disease (eg, metastatic cancer) or patient preference.

Statistical analyses

Continuous variables were compared using Student t test, χ² test and Fisher's exact t test (when one or more expected cell frequencies were < 5) were used for comparison of proportions. A p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

### Duration of remission and long-term prognosis according to the extent of disease in patients with ulcerative colitis on continuous mesalamine treatment [^116qgF4m]. Colorectal Disease (2008). Low credibility.

Aims

To describe the long-term prognosis of ulcerative colitis (UC) and to establish whether a correlation exists between the different anatomic locations of the disease and the risk of relapse in a homogeneous cohort of patients with UC in clinical remission, all treated with fixed doses of oral mesalamine from the date of enrollment to the appearance of the first relapse.

Method

We distinguished the patients with pancolitis and left-sided colitis from those with distal colitis. The follow-up lasted up to 5 and 6 years for the patients with pancolitis and left-sided colitis, respectively, and up to 9 years for the patients with distal colitis.

Results

One hundred and fifty patients satisfied the enrollment criteria. We registered 19 drop-outs. All the patients had relapsed within 9 years. In most cases relapses arose within 2–3 years. The patients with pancolitis had a shorter time to relapse (100% relapsed after 5 years) than the patients with left-sided colitis (100% after 6 years) or distal colitis (100% after 9 years). None of the enrolled patients developed a cancer. Extraintestinal complications were observed in 9% of cases and surgery was needed in five patients only.

Conclusion

The first 2–3 years after the enrollment of patients with UC in remission was the period at higher risk of relapse. No relationship was found between the different anatomic locations of the disease and the risk of relapse, even if distal colitis showed a slightly better course.

### What is the ideal approach-doublet, triplet, or quadruplet (s)? [^1155FXyF]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2024). Medium credibility.

Significant progress has been made in the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM), with the introduction of several new drugs with different mechanisms of action. The treatment of newly diagnosed MM has evolved dramatically with the development of highly effective combinations that include 1 or more of the new drugs. Despite the continuing improvement in the overall survival of patients with MM, nearly a quarter of the patients have significantly inferior survival, often driven by a combination of factors, including tumor genetics and host frailty. The focus of initial therapy remains rapid control of the disease with reversal of the symptoms and complications related to the disease with minimal toxicity and a reduction in early mortality. The selection of the specific regimen, to some extent, depends on the ability of the patient to tolerate the treatment and the underlying disease risk. It is typically guided by results of randomized clinical trials demonstrating improvements in progression-free and/or overall survival. While increasing risk calls for escalating the intensity of therapy by using quadruplet combinations that can provide the deepest possible response and the use of autologous stem cell transplant, increasing frailty calls for a reduction in the intensity and selective use of triplet or doublet regimens. The choice of subsequent consolidation treatments and maintenance approaches, including duration of treatment, also depends on these factors, particularly the underlying disease risk. The treatment approaches for newly diagnosed myeloma continue to evolve, with ongoing trials exploring bispecific antibodies as part of initial therapy and CAR T cells for consolidation.

### Clinical predictors of the risk of early colectomy in ulcerative colitis: a population-based study [^116yPZAf]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Background

A subset of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) will require colectomy within a few years of diagnosis. Thus, our aim was to determine the clinical predictors of early colectomy among patients with UC who are hospitalized with an acute flare.

Methods

Using population-based surveillance (1996–2009), all adults (≥ 18 years) hospitalized for UC within 3 years of diagnosis (n = 489) were identified. The primary outcome was a colectomy within 3 years of diagnosis. All medical charts were reviewed. A logistic regression model evaluated clinical variables that predicted colectomy within 3 years of diagnosis, and adjusted odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were reported.

Results

Among patients admitted to hospital with UC within 3 years of diagnosis, 57.7% underwent colectomy, with the odds of colectomy decreasing by 12% per year. Early colectomy was more likely among patients aged 35 to 64 years versus 18 to 34 years (OR 2.18 [95% CI, 1.27–3.74]), males (OR 2.03 [95% CI, 1.24–3.34]), those with pancolitis (OR 5.38 [95% CI, 3.20–9.06]), and living in rural areas (OR 2.81 [95% CI, 1.49–5.29]). Prescription of infliximab before hospitalization increased odds of surgery (OR 5.12 [95% CI, 1.36–19.30]).

Conclusions

Patients hospitalized for UC have a high risk of early colectomy. This is particularly true in middle-aged men, those living in rural areas, and those without response to infliximab.

Colon ischemia (CI) — bleeding burden and anemia metrics: Rectal bleeding is usually mild, but among 550 patients with severe hematochezia, 11.8% had CI as the cause. Severe hemorrhage occurs mainly with gangrenous CI, fulminant pancolitis, and IRCI. Anemia is common, with 42.6% of 364 CI patients having hemoglobin < 12 g/dl (similar to 36% in a more recent series), and blood transfusion is required in < 5% of CI presentations.

Conclusion

In conclusion we present a descriptive account of a large cohort of patients with a rare multi-system disease, and in so doing provide clinical insight into the management of autoimmune pancreatitis, supporting in particular the use of a radiologic centred approach to diagnosis and management. This parallels the reality faced by many clinicians not able to access histology for diagnosis, and provides ongoing support for the development of diagnostic pathways that are adaptable to varied clinical settings.

### Modelling the benefits of an optimised treatment strategy for 5-ASA in mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis [^111buywL]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

For the induction phase of the model, patients progressed through the treatment pathway in a sequential manner with no repeated courses and no skipped treatments (pathway composed of 5-ASA treatments, steroid treatments and anti-TNF therapies, (table 1), with treatments based on clinical guideline recommendations.

Table 1
Induction phase treatments

After each treatment, a decision point was reached where it was assessed whether patients had achieved remission or remained with active disease. Once patients reached remission, they were not modelled to receive any further induction treatment; if patients remained with active disease then they progressed to the next treatment. Two induction treatment approaches were modelled: standard treatment (lower 5-ASA dose intensity (2–2.9 g/day oral)) and optimised treatment (including high-dose combined 5-ASA (≥ 3 g/day oral plus 1 g/day rectal) with/without optimised oral steroids (using budesonide MMX as an example regimen)). All patients who achieved remission on optimised treatment without the need for systemic steroids (ie, achieved remission on 5-ASA, topical steroids or optimised oral steroids) were modelled to enter the 1-year maintenance phase; this was to ensure that the same number of patients in the standard and optimised pathways started maintenance therapy.

### Metabolic panniculitis: α-1 antitrypsin deficiency panniculitis and pancreatic panniculitis [^1152Z9oW]. Dermatologic Therapy (2010). Low credibility.

Panniculitis can be the initial presentation of both alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency and pancreatic disease. They can both present with abscess-like draining nodules, but may present like other forms of panniculitis with erythematous nodules. It is important to consider these in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with panniculitis. Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is a relatively common disorder mainly affecting the lungs and liver. It frequently goes undiagnosed, yet critical interventions can be made to minimize disease progression. Panniculitis associated with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency can be difficult to treat. Pancreatic panniculitis occurs in less than 3% of patients with underlying pancreatic disease and is often associated with arthritis. Diagnosis and treatment of the underlying pancreatic disease is imperative.

Results

Search results

A flow diagram of the database search results and study inclusion is shown in figure 1. After the removal of duplicate entries, 168 potentially eligible studies were identified, and a preliminary screening of them was done based on their titles and abstracts. Subsequently, 34 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility, and 15 studies were excluded. Finally, 19 studieswere included in the systematic review and meta-analysis.

Figure 1
A flow diagram of the database search results.

Characteristics of included studies

The 19 studies contained a total of 2612 patients with moderate-to-severe, active UC. The mean age of the patients ranged from 26.0 to 46.4 years, and the proportion of males ranged from 38.5% to 68.9%. All of the studies provided information regarding the proportions of patients with extensive disease or pancolitis, 15 studies reported data on patients previously exposed to anti-TNF treatments, 16 studies had information on patients with prior vedolizumab (VDZ) exposure, 13 studies included patients with prior ustekinumab (UST) exposure and 9 studies reported the proportion of patients who had received 2 or more prior biological treatments. The details of the included studies are summarised in table 1. The dose of tofacitinib is documented in online supplemental table S1.

Clinical response

A total of 11 studiesassessed the clinical response rate at various time points. Due to the heterogeneity (I² ranging from 64% to 91%) across the studies, estimates by random-effects models were used as the pooled effect. The pooled estimates for clinical response rate were, 0.58 (95% CI 0.49 to 0.67) at week 8, 0.61 (95% CI 0.58 to 0.67) at weeks 12–16, 0.51 (95% CI 0.40 to 0.68) at weeks 24–26 and 0.51 (95% CI 0.26 to 0.77) at week 52 (figure 2).

### Presence of risk factors associated with colectomy among patients with ulcerative colitis: aanalysis of data from the tofacitinib OCTAVE ulcerative colitis clinical program [^1155Rd22]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

A variety of predictors of colectomy have been proposed, including demographic, genetic, serologic, and endoscopic factors. Disease extent has been identified as one of the strongest predictors of colectomy among patients with UC. A retrospective review of patients with severe UC found that male patients, those diagnosed between the ages of 34 and 64 years, and those with pancolitis, had an increased likelihood of early colectomy. Furthermore, a previous systematic review that evaluated the risk factors for colectomy in patients with chronic refractory UC found that prior TNFi exposure was associated with a higher risk of colectomy. In the present analysis, all patients who underwent colectomy had prior TNFi failure, compared with 37.7–55.3% across the treatment groups of each study included in this analysis. These results suggest that patients with risk factors for colectomy and those with prior TNFi failure may represent a more treatment-refractory population, and this population is at higher risk for colectomy than a population with no prior risk factors for colectomy, or one that is TNFi-naïve. This finding is of particular relevance in environments where product labeling for tofacitinib requires previous failure of TNFi therapy. Most patients also had severe endoscopic disease (MES of 3) on program entry and moderately or severely active disease, based on the total Mayo score, prior to colectomy; however, the extent of disease varied, with a small majority having extensive colitis/pancolitis. Out of all the patients who underwent colectomy, only one patient in OCTAVE Open had a serum albumin level < 3.5 g/dL, suggesting that the risk factors for colectomy in an outpatient population differ from those in an inpatient population. Further studies are required to determine factors predictive of colectomy among patients with chronic refractory UC.

### World gastroenterology organization practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of IBD in 2010 [^1153k91A]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) represents a group of idiopathic, chronic, inflammatory intestinal conditions. Its two main disease categories are: Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), which feature both overlapping and distinct clinical and pathological features. While these diseases have, in the past, been most evident in the developed world, their prevalence in the developing world has been gradually increasing in recent decades. This poses unique issues in diagnosis and management which have been scarcely addressed in the literature or in extant guidelines. Depending on the nature of the complaints, investigations to diagnose either form of IBD or to assess disease activity will vary and will also be influenced by geographic variations in other conditions that might mimic IBD. Similarly, therapy varies depending on the phenotype of the disease being treated and available resources. The World Gastroenterology Organization has, accordingly, developed guidelines for diagnosing and treating IBD using a cascade approach to account for variability in resources in countries around the world.

12.3.2 Practice points

1 Paediatric‐onset UC is a risk factor for CRC, especially UC pancolitis. However, the absolute risk of CRC in children under the age of 18 years is low; CRC is exceptionally rare before puberty (Agreement 100%).
2 Risk factors for dysplasia or CRC in children with UC include long disease duration, VEO disease, PSC and family history (first‐degree relative) of CRC (Agreement 100%).
3 In patients with PSC and UC, colonoscopy should be considered annually or every 2 years from the time of PSC diagnosis. However, surveillance could be deferred in pre‐pubertal children while individualising based on risk factors (disease duration, family history, severity of the disease over time, and disease extent), since CRC is extremely rare under the age of 12 years, even in the presence of PSC (Agreement 100%).
4 Children who start CRC surveillance before the age of 18 should have surveillance intervals thereafter determined as per adult CRC surveillance guidelines (Agreement 100%).
5 Characterisation, therapeutic management and follow‐up of colonic dysplasia in children with IBD should largely follow guidance outlined for the adult IBD population. However, as dysplasia is such a rare occurrence in children, cases with dysplasia should be discussed between a paediatric gastroenterologist, an expert endoscopist and a histopathologist to determine optimal management (Agreement 100%).
6 Patients with UC and PSC have a high lifetime risk of hepatobiliary malignancy, with MRCP‐based surveillance shown to reduce mortality in the adult population. However, the risk of hepatobiliary cancer onset in childhood is low, with the pre‐puberty risk extremely low. Currently, there is insufficient evidence to recommend routine MRCP surveillance in paediatric patients with IBD‐PSC (Agreement 92%).

### AGA clinical practice update on diagnosis and management of immune checkpoint inhibitor colitis and hepatitis: expert review [^1149jcjz]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) enterocolitis — endoscopic distribution and diagnostic testing notes that "no mucosal inflammation is found in as many as 20%–30% of patients with suspected ICI enterocolitis". "Pancolitis is the most common presentation of luminal inflammation". Left-sided disease is common: "Approximately 95% of patients have inflammation in the left colon on biopsy", and "a flexible sigmoidoscopy is often adequate for making a diagnosis". Nevertheless, "Isolated upper GI inflammation (gastritis, gastroenteritis, or enteritis) can also occur on ICIs with a frequency likely in excess of 10%", so "Esophagogastroduodenoscopy is reasonable to consider in patients with negative flexible sigmoidoscopies". Imaging adds little: "Cross-sectional abdominal imaging by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging has a limited role in diagnosing ICI enterocolitis", and available CT data come from "Small retrospective analyses (both with 30–40 patients)".

### Tacrolimus therapy in moderate to subacute ulcerative proctocolitis: a large single-centre cohort study [^113uBBnc]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To explore the 'real world' effectiveness of tacrolimus therapy for refractory ulcerative proctocolitis (UC).

Design

Retrospective cohort study using prospectively collated clinical data.

Setting

A single district general hospital in Kent, UK. Clinical decisions and regular monitoring were undertaken by a single expert in inflammatory bowel disease.

Patients

All patients started on tacrolimus between January 2010 and August 2016 at Tunbridge Wells Hospital.

Interventions

Following failure of conventional medication, tacrolimus was commenced at 0.5mg/kg twice daily. Drug trough levels of 5–20ng/mL were targeted. Other immunomodulation was stopped and steroids were weaned over 4–6 weeks.

Main Outcome Measures

Treatment duration was measured for each patient. If the drug was stopped, the rationale, including specific side effects, was recorded. The patient's subsequent management plan was noted.

Results

Thirty-five patients were started on tacrolimus (range: 18–85, median: 36 years). Disease extent included proctitis to pancolitis. Twenty-five patients derived no benefit. Four patients responded, but drug side effects necessitated withdrawal. Eighteen of these 29 patients (62%) underwent surgery. One patient, who had previously responded, stopped the drug after becoming pregnant (healthy subsequent birth). Therefore, 5 of 35 patients (14%) remain on tacrolimus with sustained clinical response, ranging from 6 to 76 (median: 32) months of treatment. Treatment was most effective for proctosigmoiditis. There were no other demographic or biological markers for success.

Conclusions

In line with UK and European guidelines, tacrolimus can be beneficial for refractory UC. With appropriate monitoring, it appears treatment can be continued safely long term.

### Primary sclerosing cholangitis in children with inflammatory bowel disease: an ESPGHAN position paper from the hepatology committee and the IBD porto group [^112nkjCz]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a progressive liver disease with a chronic course, characterized by the destruction of the intra‐ and extrahepatic bile ducts. Approximately 5%–10% of patients with childhood‐onset inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have or will develop PSC. Conversely, children who do not have known IBD at the time of PSC diagnosis are likely to develop IBD in the years thereafter. In a cohort of children with both PSC and IBD (PSC–IBD), 60% were diagnosed with both conditions simultaneously. In 26%, PSC was diagnosed after IBD, and in 14%, IBD was diagnosed after PSC. Thirty to sixty percent of children with PSC will also display features of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH).

With long‐term complications such as cirrhosis, hepatopancreatobiliary and colorectal malignancies, which can become evident in young adulthood, children and adolescents with childhood‐onset PSC–IBD carry a high disease burden with uncertain outcomes including disability and impact on their work and/or education.

Several practice guidelines have been published on the management of adult PSC, but currently, there is no standardized guidance for the management of patients with childhood‐onset IBD and PSC. To address this, the European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) governing board commissioned a core group of experts from the Hepatology Committee and the Paediatric IBD Porto group to provide a position article. The aim of this position article is to provide pediatric gastroenterologists with an evidence‐supported overview of the diagnostic and therapeutic approach of PSC associated with IBD (Box 1).

Box 1.
Nomenclature

The International primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) Study Group recently provided the following working definitions:

Large duct PSC: High‐quality magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) or endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with features compatible with sclerosing cholangitis in the absence of apparent causes of secondary sclerosing cholangitis.

Small duct PSC: histologic features typical of PSC with normal and recent (< 1 year) high‐quality MRCP or ERC in the absence of other cholestatic disorders.

PSC with features of autoimmune hepatitis: PSC with biochemical, serological, or histological features of autoimmune hepatitis.

In most pediatric studies the commonly used term for the overlap syndrome between sclerosing cholangitis and autoimmune hepatitis is "autoimmune sclerosing cholangitis" or "juvenile sclerosing cholangitis", where the latter term acknowledges the significantly higher prevalence of this condition in children as compared to adults.

4.5.1 Evidence

Most children with PSC and IBD have colitis with a predilection for more severe inflammation in the right colon, as opposed to ulcerative colitis (UC) which is characterized by uniform inflammation of the colon and rectum, or increasing severity of inflammation towards the rectum. Children with PSC whose IBD is labeled Crohn's disease usually have colonic involvement. Isolated ileitis or extensive small bowel involvement is very rare in PSC–IBD. Figure 4 shows the typical distribution of inflammation with rectal sparing and/or backwash ileitis in the setting of pancolitis.

Figure 4
The IBD phenotype of PSC–IBD. IBD, inflammatory bowel disease; PSC, primary sclerosing cholangitis.

Persistent rectal bleeding or perianal disease should prompt endoscopic assessment of the gut. When the indication for endoscopy is less obvious, as in the case of children with chronic abdominal pain or nonbloody diarrhea, measuring fecal calprotectin may help to distinguish who is in need of a colonoscopy. A raised value signifies the presence of active inflammation warranting colonoscopy, whereas a normal value reduces the probability of finding inflammation to almost zero. It is unknown if this test strategy performs equally well in children with PSC and asymptomatic colitis, where there is typically mild intestinal disease, a reversed right to left gradient of inflammation, and rectal sparing. Despite milder colonic inflammation in PSC–IBD, fecal calprotectin values may be very similar to that in patients with "non‐PSC IBD". This apparent paradox has been provisionally explained in a study among adult patients with active PSC, in whom endoscopically quiescent colitis (assessed with the UC endoscopic index of severity [UCEIS]) was correlated with fecal calprotectin, biliary calprotectin (samples collected during ERCP) and markers of cholestasis. It was hypothesized that fecal calprotectin may not necessarily reflect only the severity of colonic inflammation, but also the severity of the concurrent biliary inflammation.

### Differentiating ulcerative colitis from Crohn disease in children and young adults: report of a working group of the north American society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition and the Crohn's and colitis foundation of America [^113tmsFD]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2007). Medium credibility.

Ulcerative colitis (UC) endoscopic classification and extent in children — during endoscopy, UC is typically classified into proctitis, left-sided disease, subtotal colitis, and pancolitis; proctitis is disease limited to the distal 15 cm of colon past the anal verge, and there should be no evidence of discontinuous inflammation, and the endoscopic findings should be uniform. Most epidemiological studies do not differentiate between subtotal colitis and pancolitis, and the Working Group of the World Congress of Gastroenterology recently recommended 3 subgroups: ulcerative proctitis (E1), left-sided UC (E2), and extensive UC (E3, which includes both subtotal colitis and pancolitis, or any UC proximal to the splenic flexure). Studies in children suggest that in approximately 80% of patients with UC, inflammation extends proximal to the splenic flexure or involves the whole colon (ie, > 80% of children have extensive UC).

Outcome and follow-up

A repeat CT abdomen-pelvis on day 31 of admission showed an improvement in the transverse colon which was now 4 cm in calibre. Subsequently, flexible sigmoidoscopy was attempted and revealed a normal mucosa from anus to distal descending colon. The biopsy showed no signs of IBD or dysplasia. The patient was now eating a regular diet and bowel movements had settled. He was discharged with no medications to take home and was planned to be followed up in 6 weeks.

### Risk factors and long-term outcome of disease extent progression in Asian patients with ulcerative colitis: a retrospective cohort study [^116uo1aC]. BMC Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

In the present study, we found that only initial disease location had an impact on the risk of extension. Patients with initial E1/2 were at greater risk of extending to pancolitis. Several studies have demonstrated that patients with proctitis are at greater risk to extend to pancolitis. In a recent study, the only predictor for UC extension was having E2 extent at baseline compared to E1. According to a recent meta-analysis, extension was 17.8% (95% CI 11.2–27.3) from E1 to E3, 27.5% (95% CI 7.6–45.6) from E2 to E3 and 20.8% (95% CI 11.4–26.8) from E1 to E2. In our study, though patients with E1 at baseline had the highest rates of disease extension of which the majority belongs to E1 to E2 extension, patients with E2 had a higher risk of progression to E3 compared to E1. This finding suggests that clinicians need to follow E2 patients more closely who are on higher risk for progression to pancolitis. Other previously reported risk factors for disease extension have also been examined. In the current study, there was a trend, albeit not statistically significant, toward increased risk of disease progression in patients diagnosed at a younger age. In contrast, smoking may have a protective effect against proximal disease extension. Albeit there was a trend, we failed to find a statistically significant difference between smokers and non-smokers (p = 0.171). Altogether, risk factors have been largely inconsistent across studies and better predictors of disease progression are needed.

### Treatment persistence and colectomy-free outcomes in patients with ulcerative colitis receiving golimumab or adalimumab: a UK experience [^115XvGnG]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is the most common type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in the UK, with around 146 000 people affected.UC is a chronic disease, with patients experiencing relapses and periods of remission, and patients who initially have disease of limited extent (proctitis) sometimes progressing to more extensive disease (proctosigmoiditis, left-sided colitis or pancolitis). Symptoms of UC include bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, urgency and tenesmus as a result of inflammation and ulceration of the colonic mucosa.

UK and European clinical guidelines recommend that UC treatment selection should aim for sustained steroid-free remission, and consider disease severity, extent and current activity. Treatment options for UC include aminosalicylates (5-ASA), corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, biologics and the Janus kinase inhibitor, tofacitinib. Although biologics are efficacious in many patients, failure to respond has been reported to occur in 30.0%–40.0% of patients with acute refractory UC. A secondary loss of response to biologics is also experienced by some patients, which is believed to result from antidrug antibodies formed due to biologics being naturally produced proteins; antidrug antibodies have been detected in ≤ 41.0% of patients with UC receiving biologics.

The therapeutic potential of biologics reported in clinical trials, with narrowly defined populations and carefully controlled conditions, is not always seen in clinical practice, with suboptimal adherence and persistence impacting clinical outcomes. Studies that explore real-world treatment outcomes following product approval are valuable in providing decision-makers with insight to the effectiveness of a product used beyond the controlled environment of a clinical trial. Published studies report treatment persistence rates at 1 year for biologics ranging from 35.0% to 63.0% in patients with UC from Ireland, the USA and Canada. A number of observational studies have explored treatment response in the three antitumour necrosis factor (anti-TNF) agents currently licensed for use in UC. These have included multicentre cohort studies of adalimumab and golimumab in Spain, an observational study of golimumab in Italian primary IBD centresand a retrospective analysis of the outcomes of infliximab treatment at a Japanese academic hospital.

### What is the latest in autoimmune pancreatitis [^113P1mHk]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP) is a steroid-responsive fibroinflammatory disorder with 2 clinically distinct subtypes known as type 1 autoimmune and type 2 autoimmune pancreatitis. Type 1 AIP is considered the pancreatic manifestation of immunoglobulin G4-related disease, a systemic disease often presenting with other organ involvement. Advances in understanding the unique clinical presentation, imaging findings, histopathology, and clinical course of this relatively uncommon disease have led to international consensus regarding diagnosis and treatment. While corticosteroids remain the mainstay of treatment, several emerging novel therapies have been explored primarily in the context or relapsing and refractory cases.

### IgG4 related disease-a retrospective descriptive study highlighting Canadian experiences in diagnosis and management [^112ZH2HS]. BMC Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Retrospective descriptive review is inevitably limited as compared to prospective studies, but for a rare disease managed by many clinicians, across in-patient and out-patient settings, it remains distinctly hard to be prospective in ones approach. Nevertheless clinicians and patients are in need of descriptions of disease that match their own experience and practice, as is the case here: our data therefore adds to the breadth of experience described for this difficult and often enigmatic disease, and highlights how patients have presented and been managed over time, as concepts about the disease have evolved, and clinicians have grown in their experience. Ideally specialist clinics would triage referrals and facilitate more prospective studies to address more closely the role of radiology over histology in diagnosing this syndrome. Clearly our approach can't formally validate the scoring systems in use (and isn't designed to; nor is it designed to utilise every scoring system presently available not least because not all clinical information was available to us, and this obstacle could not be overcome retrospectively), but nevertheless we can demonstrate their applied utility, which reflects the interest of clinicians. Similarly our observations largely reflect the type 1 AIP disease spectrum, and there will inevitably be patients presenting with type 2 disease (albeit much less common) who do not adequately fit into our description.

Autoimmune pancreatitis is notably a highly steroid sensitive disease. In our series there was a lower than expected steroid response to treatment. The likely explanation for this, once again, reflects the real world practice described. In settings where patients present to a variety of clinicians, in which referral pathways are set and potentially limited by pressure on resources, it is more likely that patients will have a delay in diagnosis and hence a potential impact on treatment. Additionally without clinical confidence from treating prior patients, clinicians may not always capture diagnosis accurately i.e. there is a risk of over-diagnosis. Our series, and many others, are therefore of importance in repeatedly highlighting this disease once again to a general audience. We demonstrate that it is important to consider autoimmune pancreatitis as a potential diagnosis, and that the combination of prompt high quality radiologic imaging and serologic studies, should allow all clinicians to make the diagnosis, and instigate prompt intervention.

### Clinical profile and treatment outcomes in autoimmune pancreatitis: a report from north India [^115NPnGX]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Summary Box

What is already known:

Autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP) is a rare autoimmune inflammatory disease of the pancreas
The majority of published studies are based on small patient populations and come mainly from Japan and the USA
Data from other parts of the world concerning the clinical features of AIP and the response to treatment are scarce

What the new findings are:

AIP is being increasingly diagnosed in India
The clinical manifestations, imaging features, treatment response and long-term outcomes of patients with AIP from north India are consistent with previously published reports from other parts of the world
Treatment with steroids is universally effective, with the majority of patients remaining asymptomatic after successful treatment

### Sclerosing mesenteritis and mesenteric panniculitis-clinical experience and radiological features [^114bRcvd]. BMC Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

MP with typical radiological findings is usually clinically and radiologically stable over time with mostly none or mild symptoms. Radiology is useful for diagnosis but the correlation between the radiological score and the clinical severity is poor and radiological progress over time seems uncommon. Therefore, radiology is not needed for routine follow-up in typical cases when malignancy has been ruled out. Corticosteroids are first line treatment and thiopurines may be useful if maintenance treatment is needed. Atypical radiology with histopathology compatible with SM may represent a separate entity with a more aggressive clinical course. This group has fluctuating radiological changes in multiple compartments of the abdomen but a prompt response to corticosteroid treatment. We propose that the term SM should be reserved for this condition.

Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) clinical presentation and diagnostic considerations — "AIH is an immune-mediated inflammatory liver disease of uncertain cause which affects all ages, both genders, and all ethnicities". "Patients may be asymptomatic, be chronically ill, or present with acute liver failure (ALF); and the diagnosis must be considered in all patients with acute or chronic liver inflammation, including patients with graft dysfunction after LT". "AIH does not have a signature diagnostic feature, and the diagnosis requires the presence of a constellation of typical features which can vary between patients with the same disease and can occur in other liver diseases". Outcomes can include "Progression to advanced hepatic fibrosis, cirrhosis, death from liver failure, or LT", and therapy notes that "Treatment with immunosuppressive agents has been life-saving, but management regimens may be long-term, associated with serious side effects, and variably effective".

3.9.1 Thiopurines

While studies vary in quality, meta-analyses consistently report a benefit of thiopurines over placebo for the maintenance of steroid-induced remission in UC but not for induction of remission. Meta-analysis of three randomised controlled thiopurine maintenance studies favours thiopurines over placebo (RR 0.6, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.95). In a further meta-analysis, OR was 2.59 (95% CI 1.26 to 5.3), absolute risk reduction was 23% and the number-needed-to-treat (NNT) to prevent one recurrence was five. A recent Cochrane review included 232 patients from four maintenance studies of azathioprine versus placebo and showed a benefit of azathioprine over placebo (44% vs 65% failure, respectively, RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.86). The side effects of thiopurines, both short- and long-term, should be considered (see Section 5.2.2 on Drug management: thiopurines) in choice of therapy, and also in decisions about duration of therapy, particularly in older patients (see Section 5.2.7.1 Stopping thiopurines).

### Backwash ileitis does not affect pouch outcome in patients with ulcerative colitis with restorative proctocolectomy [^116vyytp]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2011). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

There has been controversy over the significance of active inflammation of the terminal ileum (also known as backwash ileitis) in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease of indeterminate type for diagnosis and pouch construction. We investigated the impact of backwash ileitis on pouch outcome after restorative proctocolectomy with ileoanal pouch anastomosis.

Methods

Data from patients with backwash ileitis (n = 132) were compared with those from 132 matched controls without ileal inflammation for age, sex, and type of proctocolectomies with ileal pouch construction (1- or 2-stage). We evaluated terminal ileal sections from original colectomies of 2213 patients with either UC or idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease of indeterminate type, collected during a 21-year period, for extent and severity of chronic and active ileitis. Clinical pouch outcomes were assessed through a longitudinally maintained clinical outcome database that systematically catalogued all short-term and long-term pouch complications, including pouchitis, sepsis, impaired long-term pouch survival, and conversion to Crohn's disease.

Results

Regardless of severity or extent, backwash ileitis was not correlated with any clinical outcome examined, short-term or long-term.

Conclusions

Ileal inflammation is not a contraindication for restorative proctocolectomy with ileal pouch construction in patients with UC or idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease of indeterminate type. Ileal inflammation with pancolitis is not a useful criterion for classifying otherwise typical UC as colitis of indeterminate type, because pouch outcomes are not affected.

### Gross versus microscopic pancolitis and the occurrence of neoplasia in ulcerative colitis [^116Qkrqp]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

The gross extent of ulcerative colitis (UC) is a recognized risk factor for the development of colitis-related dysplasia and colorectal cancer (CRC). The risk of neoplasia associated with the microscopic extent of colitis is unknown. The aim of this study was to describe the gross and microscopic extent of colitis in patients with UC-related dysplasia/CRC.

Methods

All patients who underwent colectomy at our institution between 1992–2001 with colitis-related dysplasia/CRC were identified. Histological sections from each colectomy specimen were reviewed for the microscopic extent of colitis and the location of all lesions with dysplasia/CRC.

Results

Thirty-six patients with colitis-related dysplasia/CRC were identified of whom 30 had slides available for review. Gross pancolitis was identified in 19 patients, though microscopic pancolitis was evident in all 30 patients. Among the 11 patients with only distal gross colitis, 4/15 neoplastic lesions were proximal to the area of gross involvement.

Conclusions

UC-related neoplasia can occur in areas of the colon not grossly involved with colitis, though it did not occur in any patients without microscopic pancolitis. To devise rational cancer surveillance guidelines, further studies are needed to determine the risk of colitis-related neoplasia in patients with microscopic pancolitis but limited gross disease.

### ACG clinical guideline update: ulcerative colitis in adults [^113FB1Tu]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Ulcerative colitis — therapeutic management guidance: Therapeutic management in UC should be guided by the extent of bowel involvement, an assessment of disease activity and disease prognosis; patients with moderate-to-severely active UC or with high risk of hospitalization or colectomy should be treated with therapies that have evidence for efficacy based on clinical trials and real world studies. We recommend that prognosis should guide choice of therapy as much as activity of inflammation at the time of acute illness.

### A nomogram for predicting the response to exclusive enteral nutrition in adult patients with isolated colonic Crohn's disease [^117JGVLL]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

EEN has been widely accepted as a first-line therapy to treat active CD in children. – However, other than in the Japanese population, this intervention is not routinely utilized in adults due to heterogeneous response rate. Given that cCD patients have intact small bowel and relatively uninjured absorption function, EEN may be effective as an inducing therapy.

Our study showed that 52.9% of patients with cCD achieved clinical remission after EEN therapy, which is consistent with the results we reported previously. Given that more than half of the patients with isolated CD patients benefited from EEN therapy, we identified six factors that were predictive for the response to EEN, namely, pancolitis, colonic lesion features, SES-CD, CRP before treatment, LBMI and ∆pre-Alb, and we developed a simple, intuitive graph of a statistically predictive nomogram model that quantified the risk of nonresponse to EEN based on the five factors.

In our nomogram model, pancolitis is the greatest contributor to the risk of nonresponse to EEN, followed by LBMI and colonic lesion features. CRP before treatment showed the smallest effect on the probability of response to EEN. According to our findings, the risk of EEN therapy failure is approximately five times higher in isolated CD patients with pancolitis than in those without pancolitis. Pancolitis, characterized by high levels of inflammatory cytokines, will destroy the immunonutrition and anti-inflammatory effects of enteral nutrition.

We also observed that features of colonic lesions are related to the efficacy of EEN therapy. In particular, strictures or strictures combined with ulcers have a greater negative impact on the effectiveness of EEN therapy than fissuring ulcers. A likely explanation is that fibrostenosis and stricture are well-recognized endpoints in Crohn's disease and chronic inflammation sequelae. Strictures, the result of the wound-healing process, are accumulations of collagenous scarring that thicken the muscle layers and contract the lumina. These changes play a role in producing critical architectural changes in the intestinal wall that impede the normal movement of intestinal contents.EEN may be less effective in such luminal situations. Intestinal inflammation is not noticeable in some cases, but it does consistently coexist with strictures. Therefore, some newly diagnosed CD patients who are undergoing EEN for the first time still cannot achieve a satisfactory response to EEN therapy.

### Mucosal transcriptomics implicates under expression of BRINP3 in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis [^114Ue4Y5]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

BRINP3 Association with Disease Phenotype and Treatment

To assess whether low BRINP3 expression was associated with a particular disease phenotype, biopsies obtained from the ascending colon of patients with UC with either pancolitis or left-sided colitis were compared (Fig. 3). Individuals with left-sided disease were defined as those having no historical evidence of inflammation in the ascending colon. Therefore, alterations in BRINP3 expression at this location in these individuals would suggest that reduced expression is not associated with previous inflammation and support the hypothesis that low BRINP3 may predispose to disease onset. Although the overall expression levels compared with HC were lower in individuals with a history of pancolitis (P < 0.0008) as opposed to patients with left-sided disease (P = 0.183) (Fig. 3), BRINP3 levels were not consistent with phenotype as normal expression was observed in 30% of patients with pancolitis and low in 2 out of 7 individuals with left-sided colitis. To address the possible effects of treatment on BRINP3 expression, patients were separated into subgroups according to their medication at the time biopsies were taken. There was no difference between expression of BRINP3 with treatment (Fig. Supplemental Digital Content 8,) in the rectum or at any other location (data not shown).

### Optimizing therapy in patients with pancolitis [^114KW9LJ]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Pancolitis affects approximately 20% to 40% of the total ulcerative colitis population and remains a therapeutic challenge for clinicians. Practitioners must focus on pancolitis when evaluating a patient for ulcerative colitis, because pancolitis is associated with more severe and fulminant disease and a higher rate of colorectal cancer and colectomy. It is imperative for clinicians to be knowledgeable in the clinical course, medications, and appropriate manner to induce and maintain clinical remission to prevent serious sequelae of the disease. The purpose of this article is to provide a review of the treatment of pancolitis for general gastroenterologists, because medical management decisions have life-long effects for this subgroup of patients.

### AGA living clinical practice guideline on pharmacological management of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis [^114WGKGs]. Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

AGA Living Clinical Practice Guideline on pharmacological management of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis — future directions and updating plan note that "future selection of therapy may be based on predictive clinical and biomarker-based models", but "there is a paucity of data on how such models can inform treatment selection in the real-world setting", with "ongoing research efforts using multi-omic platforms using serum, stool, and tissue specimens" to develop predictive biomarkers. It emphasizes that "Shared decision making is an important process in selecting the management strategy for management of ulcerative colitis" and describes potential strategies including "combination advanced therapy or episodic use of nonimmunogenic advanced therapies, such as small molecules", while stating that "Further primary data are required to accurately inform the positioning of such strategies". For maintenance as a living guideline, it specifies that "the AGA will update relevant recommendations from these guidelines by periodic review of evidence every 6 months", and that the review "will include availability of phase 3 or phase 4 efficacy data for new treatments, treatment strategies, or existing treatments, as well as significant new safety concerns informing treatment positioning".

### Comparing surgical and conservative treatment approaches for perianal abscess in patients with hematologic malignancies: a comprehensive analysis [^112jLK4B]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

We observed that 67.9% of patients diagnosed with perianal abscess had neutropenia. This finding contrasted with previous reports suggesting that the typical characteristics of abscesses might be absent in individuals with severe neutropenia. Our results suggested that the presence of neutropenia might not significantly impact the formation of abscesses in this particular patient population. The diagnosis of perianal abscess primarily relies on the patient's medical history and physical examination. Imaging techniques are typically reserved for pre-surgical evaluation. Among these techniques, magnetic resonance (MR) imaging has proven to be a valuable tool in assessing perianal infections. MR imaging can identify infection sites that may not be clinically evident, making it a reliable method in these cases. It has been proposed that the presentation of perianal infection on MR imaging may vary in patients with hematologic malignancies. In these patients, perianal edema is often pronounced, but the presence of clear fistulas or distinct boundaries or processes may be limited on MR images.

In conclusion, perianal sepsis in patients with hematological malignancies is a common and serious condition that poses therapeutic challenges. Our study demonstrated that both conservative and surgical management approaches were safe and effective in resolving symptoms. We recommend considering initial conservative management for patients with clinical symptoms of recurrent abscesses or those who do not show improvement with conservative treatment. However, further prospective multicenter studies are needed to establish a definitive treatment algorithm for this condition. This study is limited by its retrospective design and relatively small sample size.

### Spatial evolution of histologic and endoscopic healing in the left and right colon in patients with ulcerative colitis [^111QEKUn]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Despite increasing interest in histologic remission as a treatment target in ulcerative colitis (UC), the accuracy of histologic findings in left colon in detecting pancolonic histologic remission is unknown.

Methods

In a retrospective cohort study of patients with endoscopically active pancolitis undergoing treat-to-target interventions, we evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of left-sided (distal to splenic flexure) histologic and endoscopic findings on colonoscopy for detecting histologic and endoscopic healing elsewhere in the colon.

Results

Of 86 patients with moderate to severely active pancolitis who underwent 2 consecutive colonoscopies during treat-to-target interventions, 38% and 51% achieved histologic and endoscopic remission, respectively. Substantial agreement (kappa, 0.67; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.51–0.83) was observed in histologic findings between left and right colon on follow-up colonoscopy. Histologic, and endoscopic, findings in left colon showed excellent accuracy in detecting pancolonic histologic remission (area under the curve (AUC), 0.96 [95% CI, 0.93–1.0]; misclassification rate, 5.9%), histologic normalization (AUC, 1.0, 0%), endoscopic improvement (AUC, 0.95 [0.96–1.0], 3.5%) and endoscopic remission (AUC, 0.98 [0.96–1.00], 5.8%), respectively.

Conclusions

In patients with active pancolitis undergoing treat-to-target interventions, histologic and endoscopic findings in the left colon on colonoscopy have excellent accuracy for detecting pancolonic histologic remission, histologic normalization, endoscopic improvement, and endoscopic remission. Flexible sigmoidoscopy may suffice for monitoring histologic and endoscopic activity in patients with pancolitis.

2.2 Classification of the quality of evidence

The quality of evidence was classified into four categories following the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach (Table 1). We categorized recommendations as weak or strong, in favor of or against an intervention. Weak recommendations imply that there was a significant variation in the decision of the voters and that physicians need to engage in a shared decision‐making process with patients. Strong recommendations suggest that almost all voters would choose that intervention. In such a case, physicians usually do not need to present an alternative intervention.

2.3 Position statements

For readability, this paper is divided into four main sections: diagnostic criteria, follow‐up strategies, therapeutic strategies, and research agenda. Each position statement (with the quality of evidence and, if applicable, the strength of recommendation) is framed and followed by a discussion of the evidence. Practical guidance sections complement the evidence by providing additional information not covered by the position statements.

2.4 Practice points

Practice points are included based on the consensus of the core group and reflect common practice where evidence is lacking. The practice points are framed, but they are not accompanied by statements about the quality of the evidence and the strength of the recommendation.

### Synchronous colorectal neoplasms in ulcerative pancolitis of 6 years duration: pathological and molecular heterogeneity [^112Mbfuq]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) complicating ulcerative colitis (UC) accounts for about 1% of all cases of CRC. Such tumours develop from pre-existing foci of dysplasia in patients with extensive and long-standing UC. We report a case of UC-associated synchronous CRC and foci of high-grade dysplasia with an additional malignant focus in the appendix in a female patient after only 6 years of pancolitis who did not have other risk factors for the development of complications. The multiplicity and the timings of the early changes noted suggest that long-standing inflammation in UC randomly damages multiple genes in epithelial cells known to contribute to colorectal carcinogenesis. Current findings also support a molecular and pathological heterogeneity during multiclonal origin of synchronous tumours whereby differences occur at various sites that were absent during the initial stages of the disease.

### The role of endoscopy in inflammatory bowel disease [^112Jb8cu]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2015). Medium credibility.

Random biopsy protocols in long-standing colitis — sampling intensity and distribution: In patients with pancolitis, random 4-quadrant biopsies are obtained every 10 cm from the cecum to the rectum, for a minimum of 33 specimens, which is believed to detect non-visible dysplasia with 90% confidence if present in 5% of the colon mucosa; in patients with less extensive colitis, random surveillance biopsies are limited to the maximally involved segments. Because of an increased frequency of left-sided CRC in UC, consideration may be given to taking 4-quadrant biopsies every 5 cm in the left side of the colon.

### Diagnosis and management of autoimmune hepatitis in adults and children: 2019 practice guidance and guidelines from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^113EhC9o]. Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Table 3 — Characteristic features of type 1 and type 2 autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) describe age, presentation patterns, cholangiopathy overlap, and cirrhosis at presentation. Type 1 AIH is seen in peripubertal and adults and often has chronic symptoms with ascites or GI bleeding rare; it can be asymptomatic in 25%-34%, with acute in 25%-75% and acute severe in 2%-6%. Type 2 AIH is usually under 14 years with acute onset (~40%), acute liver failure possible, and relapse frequent. Laboratory features for type 2 note that IgA levels may be reduced. Under autoimmune overlap with PSC (ASC in children), atypical pANCA is positive in type 1 and atypical pANCA-negative in type 2. For overlap with PBC, type 1 is seen in adults (not children). Cirrhosis at presentation in type 1 includes adults, 28%-33% (especially elderly), and children, ≤ 33%, whereas type 2 remission after drug withdrawal is rare and usually need long-term immunosuppression.

### Clinical guidelines for the management of inflammatory bowel disease: update of a French national consensus [^115aKTyV]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

New treatments and therapeutic approaches repeatedly emerged in the field of inflammatory bowel disease.

Aim

to update the French treatment algorithms for Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC).

Methods

A formal consensus method was used to determine changes to the treatment algorithms for various situations of CD and UC. Thirty-seven experts voted on questions that had been drafted by the steering committee ahead of time. Consensus was defined as at least 66% of experts agreeing on a response.

Results

Anti-TNF were reinforced as a first-line therapy rather than the use of immunosuppressant alone. Vedolizumab for UC, ustekinumab for CD took place as second-line maintenance therapy and potentially as a first-line therapy in the setting of unrestricted reimbursement for vedolizumab. Tofacitinib was recommended by the experts in case of vedolizumab failure for UC. Algorithms for complicated CD with abscess, intestinal and complex anal fistula were updated according to recent prospective cohort studies.

Conclusion

The changes incorporated to the algorithms provide up-to-date and easy-to-use guidelines to treat patients with IBD.

### Real world evidence on the effectiveness and safety of tofacitinib in ulcerative colitis in Lebanon [^1145ZZHv]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In the present study, we assessed the real-world evidence on the effectiveness and safety of tofacitinib in ulcerative colitis in Lebanon. At the end of the study at 52 weeks, 56.4% patients achieved clinical remission and endoscopic remission was achieved in 58.3% patients at 24 weeks. Ever since tofacitinib has been approved for use, many real-world studies have attempted to evaluate its effectiveness and safety. However, our study is the first to discuss this in a MENA (Middle East and North Africa) region. This is a real-world evidence (RWE) study of UC patients with moderate to severe disease who received tofacitinib in Lebanon between 2018 and 2021 and followed up for at least 12 weeks. Most patients had either pancolitis or left-sided disease with endoscopic Mayo score of 2 or 3 at the time of initiation. Also, more than half of them had failed one or more biologic therapy. This is also similar to most other previously reported RWE studies.

A meta-analysis of RWE studies of tofacitinib in UC patients was done by Lucaciu et al. and included 830 patients from 9 different studies. Among the enrolled patients, 81% were previously treated with anti-tumor necrosis factor antibodies (TNF) and 57% were previously treated with vedolizumab. The clinical remission rate at 8 weeks was 37% compared to 41,7% in our study. Rate for remission at the median follow-up of 24 weeks was 29% compared to our rate at 26 weeks of 57%. Another recent meta-analysis and systematic review included 17 RWE studies with a total of 1162 UC patients: Remission (reported in 11 studies) was achieved in 34.7% of patients at week 8 (95% confidence interval [CI] 24.4–45.1%), 47% at weeks 12 to 16 (95% CI, 40.3–53.6%), and 38.3% at month 6 (95% CI, 29.2–47.5%). Corticosteroid-free remission (reported in 5 studies) was achieved in 38.4%, 44.3%, 33.6%, and 31% of patients at week 8, weeks 12 to 16, month 6, and month 12, respectively. Mucosal healing was achieved in 48.3% and 45.3% of patients at week 8 and weeks 12 to 16, respectively.

### ACG clinical guideline update: ulcerative colitis in adults [^115AZoZK]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Ulcerative colitis — diagnosis, assessment, monitoring, and prognosis — The diagnosis of UC should be suspected in patients with hematochezia, increased stool frequency, or bowel urgency, and infectious etiologies should be excluded at the time of diagnosis. Colonoscopy with intubation of the ileum and biopsies of affected and unaffected areas should be obtained to confirm the diagnosis of UC, with mucosal biopsies interpreted by a pathologist, preferably one with expertise in gastrointestinal pathology. Categories of disease extent include proctitis within 18 cm of anal verge (distal to rectosigmoid junction), left-sided colitis extending from sigmoid to splenic flexure, and extensive colitis beyond splenic flexure including pancolitis; if the terminal ileum is normal, further evaluation of the stomach and small bowel by upper endoscopy and cross-sectional imaging is not needed unless other symptoms or findings suggest proximal gastrointestinal involvement or a diagnosis of Crohn's disease rather than UC. Definitions of disease severity are needed to guide treatment decisions and should be based on patient-reported outcomes (PROs), the inflammatory burden including endoscopic assessment and markers such as FC, CRP, and serum albumin, disease course, and disease impact. Endoscopic severity should be reported using a validated endoscopic scale such as the Mayo Endoscopic Score or the UC Endoscopic Index of Severity, and disease assessment and monitoring in response to therapy and during maintenance and suspected relapse may be performed with FC, CRP, endoscopic assessment with flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy, and/or intestinal ultrasound.

### Ulcerative colitis in adults: a review [^114mqsro]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on ulcerative colitis:

- **Definition**: UC is a chronic relapsing-remitting IBD characterized by superficial mucosal ulceration extending from the rectum to proximal colon.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathogenesis of UC is multifactorial and involves mutations in susceptibility genes, abnormalities in gut microbiota composition and host-microbiome interactions, as well as abnormalities in humoral and cellular adaptive immunity.
- **Epidemiology**: The highest incidence and prevalence of IBD are seen in the populations of Northern Europe and North America and the lowest in continental Asia. In the US, the incidence of UC is estimated at 8.8 cases per 100,000 person-years, while the prevalence is estimated at 286.3 persons per 100,000 population.
- **Disease course**: Inflammation and ulceration of the colonic mucosa may result in clinical manifestations of proctitis, proctosigmoiditis, left-sided colitis, pancolitis, severe rectal bleeding, toxic megacolon, and CRC, in addition to extraintestinal complications.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Over 10-years, 50–55% of patients remit, approximately 37% follow a chronic intermittent course, and 6% develop a chronic continuous course. An estimated 20–30% of patients require colectomy after 25 years of disease activity. The standardized mortality ratio of patients with UC, as compared with the general population, is estimated at 2.78 (95% CI, 1.48–4.75).

### Differentiating ulcerative colitis from Crohn disease in children and young adults: report of a working group of the north American society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition and the Crohn's and colitis foundation of America [^111CEvfo]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2007). Medium credibility.

Backwash ileitis in ulcerative colitis (UC) — prevalence across cohorts (Table 5) shows that in adults undergoing colectomy, 107 of 590 (18%) had ileitis, occurring in 107 of 476 with pancolitis (22%) and 0 of 114 with left-sided UC; among 18 children newly presenting with UC, 7 of 18 (39%) had erythema with associated microscopic nonspecific inflammation; in pediatric patients undergoing ileal pouch–anal anastomosis, ileitis was found in 16 of 109 patients with confirmed UC in 5-y follow-up (15%) and in 16 of 76 [22%] with pancolitis; in another UC surgical cohort undergoing ileoproctocolectomy and IPAA, inflammatory ileal changes were present in 34 of 200 (17%) patients.

### The role of endoscopy in inflammatory bowel disease [^112Wpkax]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2015). Medium credibility.

Inflammatory bowel disease endoscopy — ileoscopy and backwash ileitis identification states that ileoscopy is fundamental for distinguishing true Crohn's disease (CD) ileitis from ulcerative colitis (UC) with backwash ileitis, which "occurs in up to 25% of patients with UC with pancolitis". Backwash ileitis is characterized endoscopically by "a short, contiguous segment of mildly inflamed ileum without stricture, stenosis, or significant ulcerations" that appears continuous with cecal colitis, whereas features that favor CD ileitis include "extensive inflammation", inflammation without pancolitis, patchiness, greater severity than cecal inflammation, and "discrete ulcers or stricturing of the terminal ileum or ileocecal valve". In UC, a "cecal patch" around the appendiceal orifice "should not be misdiagnosed as CD", and studies show UC patients with a cecal patch have a "similar rate of remission, relapse, and proximal extension" compared with those without a cecal patch.

### The onset of ulcerative colitis upon Helicobacter pylori eradication in a 72-year-old woman: report of a rare case with a 3-year follow-up [^115kyUkk]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Strengths and limitations

Strengths: (1) long-term follow-up; (2) defined early course of the disease (pancolitis evolving to proctosigmoiditis) as colonoscopy of the only other patient reported 40 days after eradication suggested proctosigmoiditis; (3) differential diagnoses were ruled out (eg. bacteriological and O&P stool examinations); (4) H. pylori eradication was confirmed; (5) biochemical indicators of disease severity were monitored and reported.

Limitations: We cannot rule-out that (1) our patient would develop UC regardless of the H. pylori eradication (~ 20% of patients do after the age of 60); (2) UC onset was treatment and not H. pylori related. Although the risk of autoimmune diseases (including IBD) is increased in patients with peptic ulcer disease (PUD) who receive anti- H. pylori therapy, the same is true for PUD patients who didn't receive therapy and for patients who received antibiotics for urinary infection. Antibiotics have been suggested both as risk factors and potential therapy for IBD. A recent systematic review on antibiotic exposure and risk of IBD suggested there might be an association, and a large population-based retrospective cohort indicated increased risk in subjects exposed to antianaerobic antibiotics. On contrary, many randomized controlled trials reported antibiotics to be effective for induction of UC remission and several meta-analyses suggest overall higher remission rates with antibiotics in comparison with placebo. The fact that the patient stopped smoking as well as that she had underlying thyroid disease should also be acknowledged in the context of UC as both are potential factors that could have affected the course of the disease. Smoking was found to be protective in UC, decreasing the need for colectomy in some patients possibly due to the effect on cellular and humoral immune responses and mucus production. Furthermore, it has been reported that autoimmune disorders are more frequent in patients with IBD indicating possibly overlapping pathophysiological processes and/or shared risk factors. We cannot rule out that both factors affected the course of the disease. Nevertheless, smoking cessation could not have caused UC as the patient stopped smoking well after the disease developed. On the other hand, genetic susceptibility to autoimmune diseases could have contributed to the predisposition for subsequent development of UC.

### Long-term outcome of surgically treated Crohn's colitis: a prospective study [^117KLc3h]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose

Although bowel-sparing techniques have been published for treatment of Crohn's disease of the small bowel because of its relentless nature, extent of resection in Crohn's colitis is still a topic of debate. This study was designed to prospectively evaluate the long-term outcomes of patients with isolated Crohn's colitis to identify patients that may benefit from initial more aggressive resection.

Methods

We identified 179 patients with Crohn's disease operated on for primary colonic disease. They were divided into segmental colectomy, total abdominal colectomy, and total proctocolectomy groups, based on their initial operation. They were further characterized by extent and location of colonic involvement. Long-term outcome variables evaluated included colonic and small-bowel surgical recurrences, postoperative complications and long-term sequelae, long-term need for medical therapy, and need for permanent fecal diversion.

Results

Fifty-five patients underwent segmental colectomy, 49 total abdominal colectomy, and 75 total proctocolectomy. Patients with diffuse colonic involvement were significantly less likely to undergo segmental colectomy than total abdominal colectomy (P < 0.0001) or total proctocolectomy (P < 0.0001). Patients with distal involvement or pancolitis were significantly less likely to undergo segmental colectomy than total abdominal colectomy (P < 0.0001) or total proctocolectomy (P < 0.0001). Overall there were 31 patients (24.4 percent) with surgical Crohn's recurrences during follow-up: 19 (38.8 percent) in the segmental colectomy, 8 (22.9 percent) in the total abdominal colectomy, and 4 (9.3 percent) in the total proctocolectomy group. There was a significant difference in time to recurrence between the three groups by log-rank test (P = 0.017). Segmental colectomy patients had a significantly shorter time to first recurrence than total proctocolectomy patients (P = 0.014). After adjusting for extent of disease, the segmental colectomy group had a significantly greater risk of surgical recurrence than the total proctocolectomy group (P = 0.006). Total proctocolectomy patients were significantly less likely to be still taking medications one year after the index operation than total abdominal colectomy patients (P = 0.003) and segmental colectomy patients (P = 0.0003). During follow-up, patients with isolated distal disease were significantly more likely to require a permanent stoma than patients with isolated proximal disease (P = 0.004).

Conclusions

A more aggressive approach should be considered in patients with diffuse and distal Crohn's colitis. Total proctocolectomy in the properly selected patients is associated with low morbidity, lower risk of recurrence, and longer time to recurrence. Patients after total proctocolectomy are more likely to be weaned off all Crohn's-related medications. Long-term rate of permanent fecal diversion is significantly higher in patients with distal disease.

### CT imaging of acute E. coli-related colitis [^115R3hVE]. Emergency Radiology (2007). Low credibility.

Patients with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea often present in the acute setting to the emergency department for evaluation. After the appropriate clinical assessment, cross-sectional imaging is often utilized to evaluate for the severity of the disease. Although a wide spectrum of findings may be seen, diffuse colonic mural thickening, consistent with pancolitis, is most common. We report an Escherichia coli 0157:H7-related pancolitis in a patient with spinach intake linked to the recent outbreak.

### French national consensus clinical guidelines for the management of ulcerative colitis [^111ssH5W]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease of multifactorial etiology that primarily affects the colonic mucosa. The disease progresses over time, and clinical management guidelines should reflect its dynamic nature. There is limited evidence supporting UC management in specific clinical situations, thus precluding an evidence-based approach.

Aim

To use a formal consensus method - the nominal group technique (NGT) - to develop a clinical practice expert opinion to outline simple algorithms and practices, optimize UC management, and assist clinicians in making treatment decisions.

Methods

The consensus was developed by an expert panel of 37 gastroenterologists from various professional organizations with experience in UC management using the qualitative and iterative NGT, incorporating deliberations based on the European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation recommendations, recent reviews of scientific literature, and pertinent discussion topics developed by a steering committee. Examples of clinical cases for which there are limited evidence-based data from clinical trials were used. Two working groups proposed and voted on treatment algorithms that were then discussed and voted for by the nominal group as a whole, in order to reach a consensus.

Results

A clinical practice guideline covering management of the following clinical situations was developed: (i) moderate and severe UC; (ii) acute severe UC; (iii) pouchitis; (iv) refractory proctitis, in the form of treatment algorithms.

Conclusions

Given the limited available evidence-based data, a formal consensus methodology was used to develop simple treatment guidelines for UC management in different clinical situations that is now accessible via an online application.

Results

Cohort Demographics

Demographic data of all patients were collected. Clinical characterization of the cohort was performed in order to determine current disease activity and phenotype of the disease as well as to document the current therapy (Table 1).

Table 1.
Demographics and characteristics of IBD patients in the cohort.

A total of 89 patients with confirmed diagnosis of IBD and 40 healthy sex-, age-, and BMI-matched control individuals were included in our study (Supplementary Table 1). In the studied IBD cohort, detailed phenotyping of the patients was performed and the disease course including comorbidities, complications, and drug therapies was recorded. The data presented in Table 1 provide an overview of the disease phenotype at initial diagnosis, current disease activity, and therapy. The median age of patients with CD was 42 years, and that of patients with UC was 41 years. A total of 38% of patients with UC and 31% of patients with CD presented with normal body weight. In 62% of patients experiencing UC, the entire colon was affected in form of pancolitis. History of intestinal surgery, extraintestinal manifestations, and the number of relapses was recorded to assess disease severity and progression. There was a high proportion of extensive gastrointestinal involvement, with 53% with pancolitis, 12% with pancolitis and reflux ileitis for patients with UC, and 84% with multilocular CD. Endoscopic activity was detected in 56% with UC and in 45% with CD. Together, these data indicate pronounced disease activity in the studied cohort.

### Diagnosis and management of autoimmune hepatitis in adults and children: 2019 practice guidance and guidelines from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^1125G5bv]. Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) — autoantibody-negative hepatitis: ANA, SMA, and anti-LKM1 are absent in 19%-34% of North American and German patients originally diagnosed as cryptogenic hepatitis and then reclassified as AIH by the revised original diagnostic scoring system. Lower frequencies of autoantibody-negative AIH have been reported in other ethnicities and by other diagnostic criteria, including clinical judgment and glucocorticoid responsiveness. ANA and SMA may be expressed later in the course of the disease, and the demonstration of SLA and atypical pANCA may direct the diagnosis to AIH.

### The role of endoscopy in inflammatory bowel disease [^111fFa9i]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2015). Medium credibility.

Inflammatory bowel disease surveillance — chromoendoscopy and biopsy strategy specifies that chromoendoscopy with pancolonic dye spraying and targeted biopsies is sufficient for surveillance in IBD; consider 2 biopsies from each colon segment for histologic staging, and when chromoendoscopy is used for IBD surveillance, random biopsies for dysplasia detection are unnecessary. If chromoendoscopy is not available or its yield is reduced, random biopsies plus targeted biopsies of any suspicious appearing lesions remain a reasonable alternative. For extensive colitis, Pancolitis: 4-quadrant biopsies every 10 cm from cecum to rectum, for minimum of 33 biopsies, whereas with limited disease, No pancolitis: 4 quadrant biopsies every 10 cm limited to greatest extent of endoscopic or histologic involvement documented by any colonoscopy. Additional comments note that extent of colonic involvement should be defined by greatest extent of endoscopic or histologic involvement documented by any colonoscopy, isolated proctitis does not confer increased risk of IBD-related CRC, and patients with PSC should begin surveillance colonoscopy at the time of diagnosis, then yearly.

### Management of ulcerative colitis [^115TyGXe]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2016). Low credibility.

Medical management of UC

The treatment recommendations are based on the guidelines produced by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence and the joint guidelines produced by the European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation (ECCO) and European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN). These guidelines provide very useful and comprehensive algorithms, which cover most common clinical eventualities.

Most patients with UC can be treated on an outpatient basis, but with hospitalisation necessary for ASC. The main aim of treatment of UC in children is to achieve maximum possible symptomatic control with minimal side effects, while allowing children to function as normally as possible. The target for treatment increasingly is also looking at intestinal healing beyond simple symptomatic control to try and reduce the risk of long-term complications and surgery. Treatments can be broadly considered as those used to induce remission (at diagnosis or for a subsequent flare), such as 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) agents, corticosteroids and biologics, and those used for long-term maintenance of remission such as 5-ASA agents, biologics and thiopurines.
