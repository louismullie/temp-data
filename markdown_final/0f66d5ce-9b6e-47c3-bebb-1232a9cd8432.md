## Question

What is the dosage increase for wegovy for obesity

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the Wegovy (semaglutide 2.4 mg) dose escalation schedule for obesity, including the rationale, timing, flexibility, and what to do if doses are missed or not tolerated. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the FDA-labeled titration sequence and exact weekly increments. Then, I should verify the clinical rationale for the 4-week intervals. Next, I will review flexibility for tolerability and the option to pause or stop at 1.7 mg. After that, I need to check what to do if doses are missed and how to reinitiate. Finally, I will consider special populations, real-world adherence challenges, and a concise summary with monitoring points and counseling language.

> Let me first confirm the labeled dose escalation sequence so I don't miss a step: start at 0.25 mg subcutaneously once weekly for 4 weeks, then increase to 0.5 mg once weekly for 4 weeks, then to 1.0 mg once weekly for 4 weeks, then to 1.7 mg once weekly for 4 weeks, and finally to 2.4 mg once weekly as the maintenance dose, with the entire escalation taking 16 weeks. This is consistent across FDA labeling and major guidelines and is the same for adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older [^112ynMdv] [^115zmyja] [^1123BArJ] [^111bGd9e].

> Wait, let me verify the timing of each step so I don't misstate the intervals: each dose is maintained for exactly 4 weeks before the next increment, which means week 1–4 at 0.25 mg, week 5–8 at 0.5 mg, week 9–12 at 1.0 mg, week 13–16 at 1.7 mg, and week 17 onward at 2.4 mg if tolerated. This cadence is designed to mitigate gastrointestinal adverse effects and is reflected consistently in pivotal trials and labeling [^112ynMdv] [^1123BArJ] [^111bGd9e].

> Hold on, I should confirm the clinical rationale for this slow, stepwise escalation rather than faster titration. Gastrointestinal adverse events like nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea are dose-related and most frequent during escalation, so the 4-week intervals allow partial tolerance to develop, reducing discontinuation risk. Pooled STEP analyses show most GI events are mild-to-moderate and cluster during titration, supporting this cadence [^1123BArJ] [^115C54fc] [^116HkLue].

> I need to ensure I capture flexibility for intolerance. If a patient cannot tolerate the current dose, the label advises delaying the next escalation by 4 weeks, and if 2.4 mg is not tolerated, 1.7 mg can be used as an alternative maintenance dose. STEP protocols explicitly allowed dose reduction to 1.7 mg for those who would otherwise discontinue, with encouragement to attempt re-escalation later, which aligns with real-world treat-to-target approaches [^112ynMdv] [^113ns6hw] [^116ZK6Vm].

> Let me think about missed doses and reinitiation because this often causes confusion. If one dose is missed and the next scheduled dose is more than 2 days (48 hours) away, administer as soon as possible, but if the next dose is within 2 days, skip and resume on the regular day. If two or more consecutive doses are missed, resume the regular schedule or, if needed, reinitiate and follow the escalation schedule again to reduce GI symptoms upon re-start, which is a key safety nuance [^11161Kff].

> Next, I should review special populations. Adolescents aged 12 years and older follow the same 16-week escalation to either 2.4 mg or 1.7 mg maintenance, and in the pediatric trial, most completers reached 2.4 mg while a minority remained at 1.7 mg, supporting the adult titration paradigm in youth. I should also remember that hypotension and heart rate increases have been observed more frequently in adolescents, so monitoring is prudent [^114Pr1yE] [^113JsDjW] [^112WDjeE].

> But wait, what about real-world adherence to this schedule? I should double-check that outside trials, many patients deviate from monthly escalations, with Danish and US cohorts showing slow titration and high early discontinuation, often driven by cost and GI intolerance. This reinforces the need to counsel patients on expected GI effects, dietary strategies, and the acceptability of staying at 1.7 mg if needed to preserve adherence and outcomes [^116JCFpq] [^112Doy5F] [^114kWjHi].

> I will now examine the expected efficacy milestones to set expectations during escalation. In STEP 1, mean weight loss was about 6% by week 12 and about 12% by week 28, roughly aligning with the 1.0 mg and 1.7–2.4 mg dose ranges, respectively, which helps frame early follow-up visits and shared decision-making about pushing to 2.4 mg versus maintaining at 1.7 mg if side effects emerge [^114YQ4nW] [^115WLZCu].

> Let me reconsider the maintenance options to ensure completeness. The target maintenance dose is 2.4 mg once weekly, but 1.7 mg is an acceptable alternative if 2.4 mg is not tolerated, and both have been associated with clinically meaningful weight loss in trials and reviews, which should be communicated to patients who worry they are "failing" if they cannot reach 2.4 mg [^112ynMdv] [^115aaKv4].

> To synthesize, the Wegovy escalation is a fixed 4-week, stepwise increase from 0.25 mg to 0.5 mg to 1.0 mg to 1.7 mg to 2.4 mg over 16 weeks, with built-in flexibility to delay steps for intolerance and to maintain at 1.7 mg if needed. If multiple doses are missed, reinitiate the escalation to limit GI symptoms. This cadence balances efficacy and tolerability and is supported by FDA labeling, STEP trial designs, and major society guidelines [^112ynMdv] [^1123BArJ] [^111bGd9e].

Wegovy dose escalation for obesity is **0.25 mg weekly for 4 weeks, then 0.5 mg weekly for 4 weeks, then 1 mg weekly for 4 weeks, then 1.7 mg weekly for 4 weeks, and finally 2.4 mg weekly as maintenance** [^112ynMdv] [^115zmyja]. Each dose is maintained for 4 weeks to reduce gastrointestinal side effects [^1123BArJ]; if not tolerated, delay escalation by 4 weeks or maintain at 1.7 mg [^112ynMdv] [^113ns6hw]. The same schedule applies to adolescents aged ≥ 12 years [^114Pr1yE] [^115zmyja].

---

## Recommended dose escalation schedule

The **recommended dose escalation schedule** for Wegovy is as follows:

| **Weeks** | **Dose (mg)** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|
| 1–4 | 0.25 | Initial dose to minimize gastrointestinal side effects |
| 5–8 | 0.5 | Second escalation step |
| 9–12 | 1.0 | Third escalation step |
| 13–16 | 1.7 | Fourth escalation step |
| ≥ 17 | 2.4 | Maintenance dose |

---

Each dose is administered once weekly, and patients should remain on each dose for 4 weeks before escalating to the next dose [^112ynMdv] [^1123BArJ]. This gradual escalation is designed to minimize gastrointestinal adverse effects, which are common with GLP-1 receptor agonists [^112ynMdv] [^113bU4Z9].

---

## Rationale for gradual dose escalation

The gradual dose escalation of Wegovy is primarily intended to **reduce gastrointestinal adverse effects**, including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and constipation, which are common with GLP-1 receptor agonists [^1123BArJ]. These adverse effects are dose-dependent and typically occur during the initial weeks of treatment and during dose escalation [^116HkLue]. By slowly increasing the dose, patients are more likely to tolerate the medication and adhere to long-term therapy [^115p9Ldh].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting dose escalation

Clinical trials have demonstrated that **gradual dose escalation** significantly improves tolerability without compromising efficacy. The STEP (Semaglutide Treatment Effect in People with Obesity) trials, which evaluated **semaglutide 2.4 mg weekly**, used a 16-week dose escalation period and showed significant weight loss and improved cardiometabolic outcomes [^114YQ4nW] [^112VfZbG]. Specifically, the STEP 1 trial reported a mean weight loss of **14.9%** with semaglutide 2.4 mg compared to 2.4% with placebo over 68 weeks [^114YQ4nW]. The STEP 4 trial further demonstrated that continued treatment with semaglutide 2.4 mg resulted in sustained weight loss, whereas withdrawal led to weight regain [^112VfZbG].

---

## Management of dose escalation in clinical practice

In clinical practice, **clinicians should monitor patients closely during dose escalation** for gastrointestinal adverse effects and other potential side effects [^112MkB7e] [^112ynMdv]. If patients experience significant adverse effects, clinicians may delay the next dose escalation by an additional 4 weeks or maintain the patient at a lower dose (1.7 mg weekly) if the maximum dose of 2.4 mg is not tolerated [^112ynMdv] [^113ns6hw]. Patients should be counseled on the importance of adherence to the dose escalation schedule and the potential for transient gastrointestinal side effects [^11161Kff] [^11559yBJ].

---

## Special considerations

- **Pediatric patients**: The same dose escalation schedule applies to pediatric patients aged 12 years and older with obesity [^112ynMdv].
- **Patients with type 2 diabetes**: Semaglutide is also approved for glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes, but the dose escalation schedule differs from that used for obesity management [^115BcxFx].
- **Missed doses**: If a dose is missed, patients should resume the next scheduled dose if it is within 2 days. If more than 2 consecutive doses are missed, patients should restart the dose escalation schedule to minimize gastrointestinal symptoms [^11161Kff] [^1123BArJ].

---

## Summary of key points

- **Initial dose**: 0.25 mg once weekly for 4 weeks [^1123BArJ].
- **Subsequent escalations**: 0.5 mg, 1.0 mg, and 1.7 mg once weekly, each for 4 weeks [^1123BArJ].
- **Maintenance dose**: 2.4 mg once weekly [^112ynMdv].
- **Rationale**: Gradual escalation minimizes gastrointestinal adverse effects and improves adherence [^115p9Ldh].
- **Flexibility**: Dose escalation can be delayed or maintained at a lower dose if adverse effects occur [^116ZK6Vm].

---

The recommended dose escalation for Wegovy in obesity management involves a gradual increase from 0.25 mg to 2.4 mg over 16 weeks, with each dose maintained for 4 weeks. This approach **improves tolerability** and **supports long-term adherence**, ultimately enhancing weight loss outcomes [^114YQ4nW].

### Effect of oral semaglutide compared with placebo and subcutaneous semaglutide on glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes: a randomized clinical trial [^113AJnGt]. JAMA (2017). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists are effective therapies for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and are all currently available as an injection.

Objectives

To compare the effects of oral semaglutide with placebo (primary) and open-label subcutaneous semaglutide (secondary) on glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Design, Setting, and Patients

Phase 2, randomized, parallel-group, dosage-finding, 26-week trial with 5-week follow-up at 100 sites (hospital clinics, general practices, and clinical research centers) in 14 countries conducted between December 2013 and December 2014. Of 1106 participants assessed, 632 with type 2 diabetes and insufficient glycemic control using diet and exercise alone or a stable dose of metformin were randomized. Randomization was stratified by metformin use.

Interventions

Once-daily oral semaglutide of 2.5 mg (n = 70), 5 mg (n = 70), 10 mg (n = 70), 20 mg (n = 70), 40-mg 4-week dose escalation (standard escalation; n = 71), 40-mg 8-week dose escalation (slow escalation; n = 70), 40-mg 2-week dose escalation (fast escalation, n = 70), oral placebo (n = 71; double-blind) or once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide of 1.0 mg (n = 70) for 26 weeks.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary end point was change in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) from baseline to week 26. Secondary end points included change from baseline in body weight and adverse events.

Results

Baseline characteristics were comparable across treatment groups. Of the 632 randomized patients (mean age, 57.1 years [SD, 10.6]; men, 395 (62.7%); diabetes duration, 6.3 years [SD, 5.2]; body weight, 92.3 kg [SD, 16.8]; BMI, 31.7 [SD, 4.3]), 583 (92%) completed the trial. Mean change in HbA1c level from baseline to week 26 decreased with oral semaglutide (dosage-dependent range, -0.7% to -1.9%) and subcutaneous semaglutide (-1.9%) and placebo (-0.3%); oral semaglutide reductions were significant vs placebo (dosage-dependent estimated treatment difference [ETD] range for oral semaglutide vs placebo, -0.4% to -1.6%; p = 0.01 for 2.5 mg, < .001 for all other dosages). Reductions in body weight were greater with oral semaglutide (dosage-dependent range, -2.1 kg to -6.9 kg) and subcutaneous semaglutide (-6.4 kg) vs placebo (-1.2 kg), and significant for oral semaglutide dosages of 10 mg or more vs placebo (dosage-dependent ETD range, -0.9 to -5.7 kg; P < .001). Adverse events were reported by 63% to 86% (371 of 490 patients) in the oral semaglutide groups, 81% (56 of 69 patients) in the subcutaneous semaglutide group, and 68% (48 of 71 patients) in the placebo group; mild to moderate gastrointestinal events were most common.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients with type 2 diabetes, oral semaglutide resulted in better glycemic control than placebo over 26 weeks. These findings support phase 3 studies to assess longer-term and clinical outcomes, as well as safety.

2.1 Important Monitoring and Administration Instructions

In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, monitor blood glucose prior to starting WEGOVY and during WEGOVY treatment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].
Prior to initiation of WEGOVY, train patients on proper injection technique. Refer to the accompanying Instructions for Use for complete administration instructions with illustrations.
Inspect WEGOVY visually prior to each injection. Only use if solution is clear, colorless, and contains no particles.
Administer WEGOVY in combination with a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity.
Administer WEGOVY once weekly, on the same day each week, at any time of day, with or without meals.
Inject WEGOVY subcutaneously in the abdomen, thigh, or upper arm. The time of day and the injection site can be changed without dose adjustment.

2.2 Recommended Dosage Initiation and Escalation Schedule

Initiate WEGOVY with a dosage of 0.25 mg injected subcutaneously once weekly. Follow the recommended dosage initiation and escalation in Table 1 for all indications to reduce the risk of gastrointestinal adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6), Adverse Reactions (6.1)].
If patients do not tolerate a dose during dosage escalation, consider delaying dosage escalation for 4 weeks.

Table 1. Recommended Dosage Initiation and Escalation

2.3 Recommended Maintenance Dosage

Cardiovascular Risk Reduction and Weight Reduction

The maintenance dosage of WEGOVY for CV risk reduction and weight reduction is either 2.4 mg (recommended) or 1.7 mg injected subcutaneously once weekly.
Consider treatment response and tolerability when selecting the maintenance dosage [see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Clinical Studies (14.2, 14.3)].

Noncirrhotic MASH with Moderate to Advanced Liver Fibrosis

The recommended maintenance dosage of WEGOVY for the treatment of noncirrhotic MASH with moderate to advanced liver fibrosis is 2.4 mg injected subcutaneously once weekly.
If patients do not tolerate the maintenance dosage of 2.4 mg once weekly, the dosage can be decreased to 1.7 mg once weekly. Consider reescalation to 2.4 mg once weekly [see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Clinical Studies (14.4)].

### Semaglutide 2.4 mg for the treatment of obesity: key elements of the STEP trials 1 to 5 [^113ns6hw]. Obesity (2020). Medium credibility.

TABLE 2
Key eligibility criteria for STEP trials

Adults are excluded from the trials if there is a self‐reported change in body weight of > 5 kg within 90 days before screening. For trials that excluded patients with T2D (STEP trails 1, 3, 4, and 5), adults are excluded if they have a history of type 1 diabetes mellitus or T2D mellitus, HbA 1c ≥ 6.5% (48 mmol/mol), or previous treatment with glucose‐lowering agents or any AOM within the past 90 days before screening.

For all trials, treatment discontinuation can be decided by the investigator or participant. After discontinuation, participants are encouraged to continue to attend visits per the schedule and may be given the option to restart trial medication. Protocol‐specified discontinuation criteria include safety concerns from the investigator, calcitonin level ≥ 100 ng/L, suspicion of pancreatitis, pregnancy or intention to become pregnant, and participation in another clinical trial. Participants can withdraw consent at any point and are considered lost to follow‐up if they repeatedly fail to attend scheduled visits and cannot be contacted.

The protocols allow for dose reductions in case a participant does not tolerate the recommended target dose of 2.4 mg and may stay at the lower dose level of 1.7 mg once weekly, if needed. This is only allowed if the participant would otherwise discontinue trial treatment completely and if it is considered safe to continue trial treatment, per the investigator's discretion. It is recommended that the participant make at least one attempt to re‐escalate to the recommended target dose of 2.4 mg once weekly. Dose is recorded at selected visits throughout the trials.

Outcome measures

The primary and confirmatory secondary end points are described in Table 1. For all trials, the primary endpoints are percentage change from baseline at randomization (note that this was from week 20 in STEP 4) to end of treatment (EOT) in body weight and ≥ 5% WL from baseline after EOT (not applicable for the sustained WM trial [STEP 4]). Confirmatory secondary trial endpoints include the proportion of participants achieving a body weight reduction ≥ 10% or ≥ 15% from baseline to EOT (not applicable for the sustained WM trial [STEP 4]). Other confirmatory secondary endpoints for all the trials are change from baseline to EOT (or change from randomization [week 20] to EOT for the sustained WM trial [STEP 4]), in waist circumference (centimeters), systolic blood pressure (millimeters of mercury), and clinical outcome assessments.

### Alternative dosing regimens of GLP-1 receptor agonists may reduce costs and maintain weight loss efficacy [^115p9CyA]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

3.2 Alternative dosing of semaglutide

Though dose sizes vary between patients, both semaglutide and tirzepatide are typically administered once per week (q1wk). Indeed, once‐weekly is the dosing frequency studied in clinical trials, and phase 2 trials did not test dosing intervals longer than 1 week. We now use the mathematical models to investigate the weight loss efficacy of alternative dosing regimens.

Semaglutide is commercially available in maintenance doses of 2.4 mg (recommended) and 1.7 mg, with 0.25, 0.5, and 1 mg available as escalation doses. Figure 2 predicts the efficacy of 1.7 or 2.4 mg of semaglutide administered less frequently than once‐weekly. In Figure 2A, we plot the steady‐state percent change in body weight as a function of the dosing interval (time between doses). The most salient feature of Figure 2A is that increasing the dosing interval (i.e. decreasing the dosing frequency) does not commensurately decrease the weight loss efficacy of semaglutide. For instance, for a once‐weekly (q1wk) dose of 2.4 mg, the model predicts a steady‐state body weight reduction of 17%, which is in good agreement with clinical data for q1wk dosing. If the dose is fixed at 2.4 mg but the dosing interval is increased to 14 days (q2wk), the model predicts a steady‐state body weight reduction of 12%. Therefore, despite the fact that decreasing the dosing frequency from q1wk to q2wk decreases the total amount of drug taken over time by one half, the model predicts that patients retain 72% of their weight loss compared with q1wk. Similarly, 1.7 mg q2wk retains 69% of the weight loss of 1.7 mg q1wk. Furthermore, the model predicts that nearly 50% of weight loss is retained when comparing once‐weekly to only once‐monthly dosing (i.e. comparing a 7 versus 28‐day dosing interval in Figure 2A), though clinical validation is especially warranted for this prediction.

### Once-weekly semaglutide 7. 2 mg in adults with obesity and type 2 diabetes (STEP UP T2D): a randomised, controlled, phase 3b trial [^116csACM]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2025). High credibility.

Background

Semaglutide 2·4 mg is approved for weight management in adults with obesity or overweight in the presence of at least one obesity-related complication; however, many people with obesity and type 2 diabetes do not reach their bodyweight reduction goals with this dose. We aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of a new 7·2 mg maintenance dose of once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide in people with obesity and type 2 diabetes.

Methods

STEP UP T2D was a randomised, phase 3b, double-blind controlled, three-arm, parallel-group trial conducted at 68 hospitals, specialist clinics, and medical centres in Bulgaria, Canada, Hungary, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, South Africa, and the USA. Adults aged 18 years or older (BMI ≥ 30·0 kg/m 2, HbA 1c 7·0–10·0% [53–86 mmol/mol]) were randomly assigned (3:1:1) to receive once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 7·2 mg, 2·4 mg, or placebo, alongside a lifestyle intervention, for 72 weeks. Coprimary endpoints were the percentage change in bodyweight and the proportion of participants reaching a bodyweight reduction of 5% or greater with semaglutide 7·2 mg versus placebo. Confirmatory secondary endpoints were the proportion of participants reaching a bodyweight reduction of 10% or greater, 15% or greater, and 20% or greater, and changes in waist circumference (cm) and HbA 1c (%) with semaglutide 7·2 mg versus placebo. Efficacy was assessed in all randomly assigned participants, and safety was assessed in all randomly assigned participants who received at least one dose of the trial product. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05649137) and is now closed and completed.

Findings

Between Jan 4 and May 4, 2023, 512 participants were randomly assigned to receive semaglutide 7·2 mg (n = 307), semaglutide 2·4 mg (n = 103), or placebo (n = 102). 265 (51·8%) of 512 participants were female, the mean age was 56 (SD 10) years, mean bodyweight was 110·1 (22·9) kg, mean BMI was 38·6 (7·1) kg/m 2, and mean HbA 1c was 8·1% (0·9). Compared with placebo, semaglutide 7·2 mg led to greater reductions in mean bodyweight (-13·2% vs -3·9%; estimated treatment difference [ETD] -9·3% [95% CI -11·0 to -7·7]; p < 0·0001); more participants reaching bodyweight reductions of 5% or greater (odds ratio 10·0 [95% CI 6·0 to 16·9]; p < 0·0001), 10% or greater (11·3 [5·9 to 21·4]; p < 0·0001), 15% or greater (8·1 [3·7 to 17·7]; p < 0·0001), and 20% or greater (12·3 [3·0 to 51·0]; p = 0·0006); and reduced waist circumference (ETD -6·5 cm [95% CI -9·0 to -4·1]; p < 0·0001) and HbA 1c (ETD -1·5% [95% CI -1·8 to -1·2]; p < 0·0001). Level 2–3 hypoglycaemia risk was low and comparable between semaglutide doses and placebo. Gastrointestinal events were reported by 163 (53·1%) of 307 participants with semaglutide 7·2 mg, 53 (51·5%) of 103 participants with semaglutide 2·4 mg, 26 (25·5%) of 102 participants with placebo; and serious adverse events were reported by 28 (9·1%) participants with semaglutide 7·2 mg, nine (8·7%) participants with semaglutide 2·4 mg, and nine (8·8%) participants with placebo. Dysaesthesia was more common with semaglutide 7·2 mg (58 [18·9%] of 307) versus 2·4 mg (five [4·9%] of 103) and placebo (none).

Interpretation

Among people with obesity and type 2 diabetes, semaglutide 7·2 mg was superior to placebo in reducing bodyweight, waist circumference, and HbA 1c. Safety and tolerability were comparable between semaglutide 7·2 mg and 2·4 mg, except for the imbalance in dysaesthesia.

### Semaglutide 2.4 mg for the treatment of obesity: key elements of the STEP trials 1 to 5 [^114hsRUd]. Obesity (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

The obesity epidemic is a public health concern, warranting further research into pharmacological treatments for weight management (WM) as an adjunct to lifestyle interventions. The Semaglutide Treatment Effect in People with obesity (STEP) program aims to investigate the effect of semaglutide versus placebo on weight loss, safety, and tolerability in adults with obesity or overweight.

Methods

Across five phase 3 trials (NCT03548935, WM; NCT03552757, WM in type 2 diabetes; NCT03611582, WM with intensive behavioral therapy; NCT03548987, sustained WM; and NCT03693430, long-term WM), ~5,000 participants are being randomly assigned to receive semaglutide 2.4 mg once weekly subcutaneously versus placebo. Results will be available in 2020/2021. For all trials, the primary end point is change from baseline to end of treatment in body weight.

Results

Participants have a mean age of 46.2 to 55.3 years, are mostly female (mean: 74.1%-81.0%), and have a mean BMI of 35.7 to 38.5 kg/m 2 and a mean waist circumference of 113.0 to 115.7 cm.

Conclusions

The STEP program evaluates the efficacy and safety of semaglutide 2.4 mg subcutaneously once weekly in a broad population. The trials will provide insights on WM in people with obesity with and without type 2 diabetes and on long-term follow-up.

Importance

No retrospective cohort study has assessed the effectiveness of semaglutide at doses used in randomized clinical trials to treat obesity (ie, 1.7 and 2.4 mg).

Objective

To study weight loss outcomes associated with semaglutide treatment at doses used in randomized clinical trials for patients with overweight or obesity.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cohort study, conducted at a referral center for weight management, retrospectively collected data on the use of semaglutide for adults with overweight or obesity between January 1, 2021, and March 15, 2022, with a follow-up of up to 6 months. A total of 408 patients with a body mass index (BMI) of 27 or more were prescribed weekly semaglutide subcutaneous injections for 3 months or more. Patients with a history of bariatric procedures, taking other antiobesity medications, and with an active malignant neoplasm were excluded.

Exposures

Weekly 1.7-mg or 2.4-mg semaglutide subcutaneous injections for 3 to 6 months.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary end point was the percentage of weight loss. Secondary end points were the proportion of patients achieving weight loss of 5% or more, 10% or more, 15% or more, and 20% or more after 3 and 6 months and the percentage of weight loss for patients with or without type 2 diabetes after 3 and 6 months.

Results

The study included 175 patients (132 women [75.4%]; mean [SD] age, 49.3 [12.5] years; mean [SD] BMI, 41.3 [9.1]) in the analysis at 3 months and 102 patients at 6 months. The mean (SD) weight loss after 3 months was 6.7 (4.4) kg, equivalent to a mean (SD) weight loss of 5.9% (3.7%) (P < .001), and the mean (SD) weight loss after 6 months was 12.3 (6.6) kg, equivalent to a mean (SD) weight loss of 10.9% (5.8%) (P < .001 from baseline). Of the 102 patients who were followed up at 6 months, 89 (87.3%) achieved weight loss of 5% or more, 56 (54.9%) achieved weight loss of 10% or more, 24 (23.5%) achieved weight loss of 15% or more, and 8 (7.8%) achieved weight loss of 20% or more. Patients with type 2 diabetes had a lower mean (SD) percentage weight loss at 3 and 6 months compared with those without type 2 diabetes: 3.9% (3.1%) vs 6.3% (3.7%) at 3 months (P = .001) and 7.2% (6.3%) vs 11.8% (5.3%) at 6 months (P = .005).

Conclusions and Relevance

The results of this cohort study suggest that weekly 1.7-mg and 2.4-mg doses of semaglutide were associated with weight loss similar to that seen in randomized clinical trials. Studies with longer periods of follow-up are needed to evaluate prolonged weight loss outcomes.

5.4 Hypoglycemia

WEGOVY lowers blood glucose and can cause hypoglycemia.

In a trial of adult patients with type 2 diabetes and body mass index (BMI) greater than or equal to 27 kg/m2for weight reduction (Study 3), hypoglycemia (defined as a plasma glucose less than 54 mg/dL) was reported in 6.2% of WEGOVY-treated patients versus 2.5% of placebo-treated patients. One episode of severe hypoglycemia (requiring the assistance of another person) was reported in one WEGOVY-treated patient versus no placebo-treated patients [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

Patients with diabetes mellitus taking WEGOVY in combination with insulin or an insulin secretagogue (e.g., sulfonylurea) may have an increased risk of hypoglycemia, including severe hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia has been observed in patients treated with semaglutide at doses of 0.5 mg and 1 mg in combination with insulin. The use of WEGOVY (semaglutide 2.4 mg or 1.7 mg once weekly) in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus or in combination with insulin has not been evaluated.

Inform patients of the risk of hypoglycemia and educate them on the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia. In patients with diabetes, monitor blood glucose prior to starting WEGOVY and during WEGOVY treatment. When initiating WEGOVY, consider reducing the dose of concomitantly administered insulin or insulin secretagogue (such as sulfonylureas) to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

5.5 Acute Kidney Injury Due to Volume Depletion

There have been postmarketing reports of acute kidney injury, in some cases requiring hemodialysis, in patients treated with semaglutide. The majority of the reported events occurred in patients who experienced gastrointestinal reactions leading to dehydration such as nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea [see Adverse Reactions (6)].

Monitor renal function in patients reporting adverse reactions to WEGOVY that could lead to volume depletion, especially during dosage initiation and escalation of WEGOVY.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this study is the first retrospective study to evaluate weight loss outcomes associated with treatment with subcutaneous semaglutide, including the highest doses approved for weight loss (> 1.0 mg) for patients with overweight or obesity, with or without type 2 diabetes. In our cohort, patients lost approximately 6.7 kg at 3 months and 12.3 kg at 6 months, equivalent to 5.9% of weight lost at 3 months and 10.9% of weight lost at 6 months. Hence, this study may be a stepping stone to demonstrating the effectiveness of semaglutide for patients aiming to lose weight. These results may support the applicability of semaglutide in a less controlled environment, as previously proven in RCTs.

Comparison With RCTs

Several RCTs evaluated the weight loss outcomes of semaglutide. In one study including 1306 patients taking semaglutide, 2.4 mg, weight loss of approximately 6% was achieved by week 12 and 12% was achieved by week 28. Our results reflect similar weight loss outcomes within the same period, particularly for patients taking doses of 1.7 mg and 2.4 mg.

In the STEP 2 trial comparing 1 mg and 2.4 mg of semaglutide for patients with type 2 diabetes, similar weight loss trends compared with those in our study were seen. In 12 weeks, weight loss of approximately 4% was achieved among patients taking the 1-mg dose, and weight loss of approximately 5% was achieved among those taking the 2.4-mg dose. In addition, weight loss at 28 weeks approached approximately 7% for patients taking the 1-mg dose and 9.6% for those taking the 2.4-mg dose. Patients without type 2 diabetes achieved higher weight loss outcomes than those with type 2 diabetes, which is also shown in our study.

In addition, considering the 16-week semaglutide titration schedule and having only 44.0% of the patients in our cohort reach maximal semaglutide doses (ie, 1.7 or 2.4 mg) compared with more than 94% of patients in RCTs, weight loss is expected to increase as more patients achieve the maximal doses of this medication.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs; semaglutide and liraglutide) — titration, missed doses, and precautions are detailed as follows: To minimize risk of GI adverse effects, gradual dose titration is recommended for semaglutide and liraglutide. Semaglutide is started at 0.25 mg weekly for the first 4 weeks, followed by doses of 0.5 mg, 1.0 mg, and 1.7 mg weekly every 4 weeks at each dose, until the maintenance dose of 2.4 mg is reached after 16 weeks; for liraglutide, it is recommended to start with 0.6 mg daily for the first 7 days, followed by doses of 1.2 mg, 1.8 mg, and 2.4 mg daily every 7 days at each dose until the maintenance dose of 3.0 mg is reached after 4 weeks. If more than 2 consecutive doses are missed, clinical judgement is required to decide on subsequent dosing, and restarting the titration schedule should be considered if 3 or more consecutive doses are missed. Liraglutide or semaglutide should not be used with other GLP-1 RAs or with dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors; caution is advised when using GLP-1 RAs in combination with insulin or sulfonylureas, with dose adjustment and monitoring for hypoglycemia. Because GLP-1 RAs can delay gastric emptying, it may impact the absorption of some medications that require rapid onset of action, and GLP-1 RAs have been associated with thyroid C-cell tumors in rodents in dose- and treatment duration-dependent fashion.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Absorption

Absolute bioavailability of semaglutide is 89%. Maximum concentration of semaglutide is reached 1 to 3 days post dose.

Similar exposure was achieved with subcutaneous administration of semaglutide in the abdomen, thigh, or upper arm.

The average semaglutide steady state concentration following subcutaneous administration of WEGOVY was approximately 75 nmol/L in patients with either obesity (BMI greater than or equal to 30 kg/m2) or overweight (BMI greater than or equal to 27 kg/m2). The steady state exposure of WEGOVY increased proportionally with doses up to 2.4 mg once weekly.

Distribution

The mean volume of distribution of semaglutide following subcutaneous administration in patients with obesity or overweight is approximately 12.5 L. Semaglutide is extensively bound to plasma albumin (greater than 99%) which results in decreased renal clearance and protection from degradation.

Elimination

The apparent clearance of semaglutide in patients with obesity or overweight is approximately 0.05 L/h. With an elimination half-life of approximately 1 week, semaglutide will be present in the circulation for about 5 to 7 weeks after the last dose of 2.4 mg.

Metabolism

The primary route of elimination for semaglutide is metabolism following proteolytic cleavage of the peptide backbone and sequential beta-oxidation of the fatty acid sidechain.

2.2 Study protocol and titration schedule

Each STEP trial included an initial dose escalation for semaglutide, with initiation at 0.25 mg once weekly for 4 weeks, increased at 4‐weekly intervals to 0.5 mg, 1.0 mg, 1.7 mg and finally 2.4 mg at week 16. Participants unable to tolerate 2.4 mg (i.e. would otherwise discontinue treatment) were permitted to remain at lower maintenance doses, with at least one attempt to re‐escalate to 2.4 mg. Participants discontinuing treatment prematurely remained in each trial.

AE information, including onset and end date, was collected throughout each trial, using open‐ended, non‐leading verbal questions. Reported AEs were proactively followed up at each subsequent visit/contact. AEs were coded using the current version of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (Version 22.1) and categorized based on severity and seriousness, using standard definitions (File S1). AE incidence was assessed as a supportive secondary safety endpoint in each trial.

4 DISCUSSION

These analyses provide a robust assessment of the GI tolerability of semaglutide 2.4 mg in ~2650 adults over 68 weeks and show that weight loss with semaglutide 2.4 mg was mostly attributable to effects unrelated to GI AEs.

Pooled data from the STEP 1‐3 trials demonstrate frequent reports of GI AEs in both semaglutide 2.4 mg and placebo arms, with nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting and constipation the most common side effects with semaglutide. The relatively high incidence of GI AEs in the placebo arms was not unexpected and may in part reflect the known underlying increased risk of GI disorders associated with obesity. While not assessed directly in our study, crude comparison of the incidences of GI AEs reported in the individual STEP 1, 2 and 3 trials, indicates between‐trial variation in incidences for both semaglutide 2.4 mg and placebo arms, which may reflect trial‐specific differences in design and patient populations.

Although GI AEs occurred more frequently with semaglutide 2.4 mg than with placebo across STEP 1‐4, the vast majority of GI AEs reported were non‐serious and mild‐to‐moderate in severity, and did not necessitate dose reduction or discontinuation. GI AEs were most prevalent during or shortly after dose escalation, declining in prevalence thereafter. While rates of nausea, diarrhoea and vomiting with semaglutide remained elevated compared with placebo throughout treatment, participants typically recovered from each event within a few days. Constipation tended to last longer, and may be because of the effects of GLP‐1RAs on GI motility. Among the participants who reported any GI AEs, the vast majority experienced their first event during the dose‐escalation period, suggesting that the elevated prevalence of GI AEs with semaglutide versus placebo after dose escalation is primarily because of additional events being reported by participants who have previously experienced a GI AE. Collectively, these results should reassure patients and physicians alike that GI AEs associated with semaglutide 2.4 mg are unlikely to be serious and will typically be transient, although a small proportion of patients may continue to experience GI AEs throughout treatment. Importantly, in STEP 1‐3, only 4.3% of participants in the semaglutide arm discontinued treatment prematurely because of GI AEs, with very few discontinuations occurring after dose escalation.

### Weight loss outcomes associated with semaglutide treatment for patients with overweight or obesity [^1175Mjd5]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, is approved to treat type 2 diabetes, with subcutaneous injection doses of 0.25, 0.5, and 1 mg administered once weekly and oral doses of 3, 7, and 14 mg administered once daily. In June 2021, the FDA approved subcutaneous semaglutide for long-term weight management, with higher doses of 1.7 and 2.4 mg once weekly. The Semaglutide Treatment Effect in People With Obesity (STEP) trials have shown the efficacy of semaglutide for the treatment of obesity. In large RCTs, patients receiving semaglutide, 2.4 mg, lost a mean of 6% of their weight by week 12 and 12% of their weight by week 28. To our knowledge, no retrospective studies have been conducted to assess the effectiveness of semaglutide at the doses used to treat obesity (ie, 1.7 and 2.4 mg). In this study, we aim to assess weight loss outcomes associated with semaglutide treatment for patients with overweight or obesity and for patients with or without type 2 diabetes.

Methods

Trial design and participants

The current work complies with all relevant ethical regulations and reports a prespecified analysis of the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled SELECT trial, details of which have been reported in papers describing study design and rationale, baseline characteristicsand the primary outcome. SELECT evaluated once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg versus placebo to reduce the risk of major adverse cardiac events (a composite endpoint comprising CV death, nonfatal myocardial infarction or nonfatal stroke) in individuals with established CVD and overweight or obesity, without diabetes. The protocol for SELECT was approved by national and institutional regulatory and ethical authorities in each participating country. All patients provided written informed consent before beginning any trial-specific activity. Eligible patients were aged ≥ 45 years, with a BMI of ≥ 27 kg m − 2 and established CVD defined as at least one of the following: prior myocardial infarction, prior ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, or symptomatic peripheral artery disease. Additional inclusion and exclusion criteria can be found elsewhere.

Human participants research

The trial protocol was designed by the trial sponsor, Novo Nordisk, and the academic Steering Committee. A global expert panel of physician leaders in participating countries advised on regional operational issues. National and institutional regulatory and ethical authorities approved the protocol, and all patients provided written informed consent.

Study intervention and patient management

Patients were randomly assigned in a double-blind manner and 1:1 ratio to receive once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg or placebo. The starting dose was 0.24 mg once weekly, with dose increases every 4 weeks (to doses of 0.5, 1.0, 1.7 and 2.4 mg per week) until the target dose of 2.4 mg was reached after 16 weeks. Patients who were unable to tolerate dose escalation due to AEs could be managed by extension of dose-escalation intervals, treatment pauses or maintenance at doses below the 2.4 mg per week target dose. Investigators were allowed to reduce the dose of study product if tolerability issues arose. Investigators were provided with guidelines for, and encouraged to follow, evidence-based recommendations for medical treatment and lifestyle counseling to optimize management of underlying CVD as part of the standard of care. The lifestyle counseling was not targeted at weight loss. Additional intervention descriptions are available.

### Semaglutide 2.4 mg / wk for weight loss in patients with severe obesity and with or without a history of bariatric surgery [^1152iAr4]. Obesity (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

This retrospective cohort study aimed to assess the effectiveness of semaglutide 2.4mg in patients with severe obesity (BMI ≥ 40kg/m 2) who had previously undergone bariatric surgery (BS) but failed to achieve satisfactory weight loss or experienced weight regain compared with patients without a history of BS with similar BMI.

Methods

The authors analyzed data from 129 patients with a BMI ≥ 40kg/m 2, including 39 with (BS+) and 90 without (BS-) a history of BS. The patients received semaglutide treatment for 24weeks starting at 0.25mg/wk and gradually increasing to reach a final dose of 2.4mg/wk. The treatment outcomes were assessed based on the percentage of weight loss, changes in BMI, and waist circumference.

Results

Semaglutide treatment resulted in significant 9.1% weight loss in the BS+ group, with no significant difference in weight loss between the BS+ and BS- groups.

Conclusions

This study is the first, to the authors' knowledge, to compare the effectiveness of semaglutide treatment in patients with versus those without a history of BS, providing valuable evidence of its efficacy. By focusing on individuals with severe obesity (BMI > 40kg/m 2 and associated comorbidities), it fills a gap in the current literature and highlights the potential of semaglutide 2.4mg as a treatment option for this specific population.

### Two-year effects of semaglutide in adults with overweight or obesity: the STEP 5 trial [^116bRTXu]. Nature Medicine (2022). Excellent credibility.

The STEP 5 trial assessed the efficacy and safety of once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4mg versus placebo (both plus behavioral intervention) for long-term treatment of adults with obesity, or overweight with at least one weight-related comorbidity, without diabetes. The co-primary endpoints were the percentage change in body weight and achievement of weight loss of ≥ 5% at week104. Efficacy was assessed among all randomized participants regardless of treatment discontinuation or rescue intervention. From 5 October 2018 to 1 February 2019, 304 participants were randomly assigned to semaglutide 2.4mg (n = 152) or placebo (n = 152), 92.8% of whom completed the trial (attended the end-of-trial safety visit). Most participants were female (236 (77.6%)) and white (283 (93.1%)), with a mean (s.d.) age of 47.3 (11.0)years, body mass index of 38.5 (6.9)kgm -2 and weight of 106.0 (22.0)kg. The mean change in body weight from baseline to week104 was -15.2% in the semaglutide group (n = 152) versus -2.6% with placebo (n = 152), for an estimated treatment difference of -12.6%-points (95% confidence interval, -15.3 to -9.8; P < 0.0001). More participants in the semaglutide group than in the placebo group achieved weight loss ≥ 5% from baseline at week104 (77.1% versus 34.4%; P < 0.0001). Gastrointestinal adverse events, mostly mild-to-moderate, were reported more often with semaglutide than with placebo (82.2% versus 53.9%). In summary, in adults with overweight (with at least one weight-related comorbidity) or obesity, semaglutide treatment led to substantial, sustained weight loss over 104weeks versus placebo.

Semaglutide (Wegovy)

At 68 weeks, the STEP 1 trial reported a mean HbA1c reduction of 0.5% in the intervention group, compared to 0.2% in the placebo group (SDs not available; p-value not reported). A similar change was reported in the STEP 3-IBT trial. In STEP 4-Maintenance trial, from randomization after the run-in period at week 20 to week 68, there was a drop in HbA1c by 0.1 (0.7) % with semaglutide 2.4 mg while there was an increase of 0.1 (0) % with the placebo group (p < 0.001) (Table 2).

In patients with obesity and DM (mean baseline HbA1c 8.1%), there was a drop in HbA1c by 1.5–1.6% in semaglutide arms, and by 0.4% in the placebo arms. There was no significant difference between semaglutide doses.

Effect on lipid profile

4 STEP TRIAL DESIGNS

Table 1 compares key aspects of the trial designs, eligibility criteria, participant demographics and baseline characteristics of the global trials.

TABLE 1
STEP trials 1‐5 and 8: study designs and participant population baseline demographics and clinical characteristics,

In STEP 1, the largest trial (N = 1961), participants were randomized to receive once‐weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg or matching placebo for 68 weeks. At week 68, treatments (including lifestyle intervention) were discontinued and an off‐treatment extension followed a representative subset of participants for a further year.

STEP 2enrolled individuals with type 2 diabetes [glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) 7.0%‐10.0%], and randomized them to once‐weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg, semaglutide 1.0 mg (the approved dose in type 2 diabetes) or placebo for 68 weeks.

STEP 3was a 68‐week trial that compared once‐weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg with placebo as an adjunct to intensive behavioural therapy and an initial low‐calorie meal‐replacement diet for all participants.

STEP 4was a 68‐week withdrawal trial, designed to assess the effect on weight change of continuing versus discontinuing once‐weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg after an initial 20‐week semaglutide run‐in period.

STEP 5is the longest trial of the STEP programme. Participants were randomized to receive once‐weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg or matching placebo for 104 weeks.

STEP 6was a 68‐week trial in adults from east Asia with a body mass index (BMI) of ≥ 27.0 kg/mwith ≥ 2 weight‐related comorbidities or a BMI of ≥ 35.0 kg/mwith ≥ 1 weight‐related comorbidity (one comorbidity had to be either hypertension, dyslipidaemia or, in Japan only, type 2 diabetes). Participants were randomized to semaglutide 2.4 mg, 1.7 mg or placebo.

### Oral semaglutide: dosage in special situations [^111CWrnr]. Diabetes Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Persons on Once-Weekly GLP1RA

People who switch from once-weekly exenatide, dulaglutide, or semaglutide should start oral semaglutide 7 days after their last injection. Similar principles, as detailed above, apply to the choice of dose of initiation. A prescription of oral semaglutide that is started in response to lack of tolerability should begin with 3 mg daily. However, if oral semaglutide is chosen owing to lack of efficacy of current therapy, one may commence with 7 mg/day.

Once-weekly semaglutide has been compared with oral semaglutide, i.e. 0.5 mg once-weekly semaglutide with 7 mg of oral semaglutide. However, the difference in the impact on weight should be explained to the patient.

### Titration and discontinuation of semaglutide for weight management in commercially insured US adults [^112Doy5F]. Obesity (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

The objective of this study is to examine real-world dose titration patterns of semaglutide for weight management (Wegovy, Novo Nordisk A/S) in US adults and identify characteristics associated with early discontinuation.

Methods

We identified 15,811 commercially insured adults who started semaglutide for weight management (administrated through single-dose prefilled pens) between June 2021 and December 2023. We depicted dose-titration patterns over 5months and identified factors associated with discontinuation using multivariable Cox regression. Sensitivity analyses examined patterns after supply shortage resolution (after October 2023).

Results

Most semaglutide users deviated from the recommended monthly dose-escalation schedule within the first 5months. By the fifth month, nearly one-half (46%) had discontinued the treatment, with similar rates (48%) among those initiating after supply stabilization. Discontinuation was strongly associated with copayment amount, with rates increased from 41% in the lowest quintile ($1-$54 per month) to 51% in the highest quintile ($161-$1460 per month). Higher discontinuation rates were also associated with lower household income and education level.

Conclusions

The deviations from the recommended dose-escalation schedule and high discontinuation rate among real-world semaglutide users indicate important challenges in the delivery of evidence-based care. Policy interventions that reduce financial barriers to the persistence of semaglutide are needed.

2.4 Recommendations Regarding Missed Dose

If one dose is missed and the next scheduled dose is more than 2 days away (48 hours), administer WEGOVY as soon as possible. If one dose is missed and the next scheduled dose is less than 2 days away (48 hours), do not administer the dose. Resume dosing on the regularly scheduled day of the week.
If 2 or more consecutive doses are missed, resume dosing as scheduled or, if needed, reinitiate WEGOVY and follow the dose escalation schedule, which may reduce the occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms associated with reinitiation of treatment.

### Semaglutide for the treatment of overweight and obesity: a review [^115aaKv4]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Obesity is a chronic, relapsing disease associated with multiple complications and a substantial morbidity, mortality and health care burden. Pharmacological treatments for obesity provide a valuable adjunct to lifestyle intervention, which often achieves only limited weight loss that is difficult to maintain. The Semaglutide Treatment Effect in People with obesity (STEP) clinical trial programme is evaluating once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg (a glucagon-like peptide-1 analogue) in people with overweight or obesity. Across STEP 1, 3, 4 and 8, semaglutide 2.4 mg was associated with mean weight losses of 14.9%-17.4% in individuals with overweight or obesity without type 2 diabetes from baseline to week 68; 69%-79% of participants achieved ≥ 10% weight loss with semaglutide 2.4 mg (vs. 12%-27% with placebo) and 51%-64% achieved ≥ 15% weight loss (vs. 5%-13% with placebo). In STEP 5, mean weight loss was -15.2% with semaglutide 2.4 mg versus -2.6% with placebo from baseline to week 104. In STEP 2 (individuals with overweight or obesity, and type 2 diabetes), mean weight loss was -9.6% with semaglutide 2.4 mg versus -3.4% with placebo from baseline to week 68. Improvements in cardiometabolic risk factors, including high blood pressure, atherogenic lipids and benefits on physical function and quality of life were seen with semaglutide 2.4 mg. The safety profile of semaglutide 2.4 mg was consistent across trials, primarily gastrointestinal adverse events. The magnitude of weight loss reported in the STEP trials offers the potential for clinically relevant improvement for individuals with obesity-related diseases.

3.4 Impact of gastrointestinal adverse events on dose and treatment adherence (1‐3 pooled analysis)

GI AEs led to dose reduction or temporary treatment interruption in 12.5% of participants in the semaglutide 2.4 mg arm versus 1.7% of participants in the placebo arm. GI AEs led to permanent treatment discontinuation in more participants in the semaglutide 2.4 mg arm (4.3%) than in the placebo arm (0.7%), with most discontinuations occurring during the dose‐escalation period in both arms (Figure 1B).

Almost all participants who experienced GI AEs in the semaglutide 2.4 mg arm continued and completed the trial (95.5%), with a similar completion rate among those who did not experience GI AEs (93.0%). The proportion of participants in the semaglutide 2.4 mg arm who completed the trials on treatment was similar for participants who experienced GI AEs (83.1%) and for those who did not (86.7%); most of these participants (83.7% and 96.0%, respectively) were receiving the 2.4 mg dose at week 68 (Table 1). Among the participants in the semaglutide arm who experienced a dose reduction or temporary treatment interruption owing to GI AEs, 74.0% subsequently completed the study on treatment (at completion, 60.2% reported taking a dose of ≥ 1.7 mg and 36.7% the 2.4 mg dose) (Table 1).

### Pharmacotherapy for obesity: moving towards efficacy improvement [^115AY6sU]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2024). Medium credibility.

In the STEP program, semaglutide was widely studied in various scenarios in the population with obesity. The program included several phase-3 trials evaluating the efficacy of subcutaneous weekly injections of semaglutide 2.4 mg for treating patients with obesity.

Common elements of the STEP 1–4 trials were the duration of 68 weeks and the 16-week-long regimen of dose escalation. The treatment was initiated with 0.25 mg semaglutide and was escalated every 4 weeks to the subsequent dosing levels of 0.5 mg, 1.0 mg and 1.7 mg until reaching the target dose of 2.4 mg. Safety and tolerability were assessed up to week 75 (68 weeks on-treatment and 7 weeks off-treatment follow-up period).

STEP 1 was a phase-3a randomized, double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled trial in 1,961 adults with obesity. The main objective of STEP 1 was to evaluate the weight-management effects of semaglutide 2.4 mg versus a placebo combined with lifestyle interventions such as counseling, 500 kcal reduced daily energy intake and increased energy expenditure (150 min/week physical activity). Factors such as a ≥ 10% or ≥ 15% reduction in body weight, changes in waist circumference, systolic blood pressure, and physical functioning scores were also evaluated as secondary endpoints. In that study, patients (n = 1,306) with obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m 2) or who were overweight (BMI ≥ 27 kg/m 2, with one or more weight-related comorbidities) received either semaglutide 2.4 mg or placebo, in addition to lifestyle changes, for 68 weeks. A total of 94.3% of the participants completed the trial. At the end of the trial, the mean percentage of body weight lost was 14.9% with semaglutide versus 2.4% with placebo (p < 0.001). The mean change in body weight (kg) is illustrated in Fig. 2. Investigators evaluated the body composition changes of a subgroup of the STEP 1 trial. The overall weight loss in the subgroup was 17.4 kg in the semaglutide group, with 10.4 kg of fat mass (60%) and 6.92 kg of fat-free mass (40%); there was an increase in the proportion of lean mass (+ 3.04% in absolute numbers). More studies are warranted to evaluate whether specific lifestyle changes could reduce the loss of lean mass with semaglutide. The secondary endpoints of the study, cardiometabolic risk factors such as waist circumference, blood pressure, glycated hemoglobin levels, and lipid levels, baseline C-reactive protein, and the proportion of participants with normoglycemia, were significantly improved in the semaglutide group compared with the placebo group. The magnitude of these improvements is presumed to be proportional to weight loss. Regarding safety, both groups reported a similar number of adverse events (89.7% in the semaglutide group and 86.4% in the placebo group). Gastrointestinal disorders were the most common and were more frequent in the semaglutide group (74.2% vs. 47.9%). Serious events (also mainly gastrointestinal disorders) were reported in 9.8% and 6.4% of the cases and led to discontinuation of the trial in 7.0% of the cases in the semaglutide group vs. 3.1% in the placebo group.

14.3 Weight Reduction and Long-Term Maintenance Study in Pediatric Patients Aged 12 Years and Older with Obesity

Overview of Clinical Trial in Pediatric Patients WEGOVY was evaluated in a 68-week, double-blind, randomized, parallel group, placebo-controlled, multi-center trial in 201 pubertal pediatric patients aged 12 years and older with BMI corresponding to ≥ 95th percentile standardized for age and sex (Study 7) (NCT#04102189). After a 12-week lifestyle run-in period (including dietary recommendations and physical activity counseling), patients were randomized 2:1 to WEGOVY once weekly or placebo once weekly. WEGOVY or matching placebo was escalated to 2.4 mg or maximally tolerated dose during a 16-week period followed by 52 weeks on maintenance dose. Of WEGOVY-treated patients who completed the trial, 86.7% were on the 2.4 mg dosage at the end of the trial; for 5% of patients, 1.7 mg was the maximum tolerated dosage.

The mean age was 15 years; 38% of patients were male; 79% were White, 8% were Black or African American, 2% were Asian, and 11% were of other or unknown race; and 11% were of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. The mean baseline body weight was 108 kg, and mean BMI was 37 kg/m2.

### Semaglutide induces weight loss in subjects with type 2 diabetes regardless of baseline BMI or gastrointestinal adverse events in the SUSTAIN 1 to 5 trials [^114WNuUC]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

2.1 Study design

We conducted a post hoc efficacy analysis by trial using all subjects in the global phase 3a SUSTAIN 1 to 5 randomized clinical trial programme. The study designs of these trials are summarized in Table S1 (see the Supporting Information for this article) and have been reported previously. 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 The programme included subjects spanning the diabetes continuum of care: drug‐naïve (SUSTAIN 1); on metformin and/or thiazolidinediones (SUSTAIN 2); on 1 to 2 therapies comprising metformin, thiazolidinediones or sulfonylureas (SUSTAIN 3); on metformin ± sulfonylureas (SUSTAIN 4); or on basal insulin ± metformin (SUSTAIN 5).

In these 5 trials across a total of 33 countries, 3918 adult subjects with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes (HbA1c 7.0% to 10.0% [53 to 86 mmol/mol] for SUSTAIN 1, 4 and 5; 7.0% to 10.5% [53 to 91 mmol/mol] for SUSTAIN 2 and 3) were randomized to semaglutide 0.5 mg, semaglutide 1.0 mg or a comparator: placebo (SUSTAIN 1, 5), sitagliptin 100 mg (SUSTAIN 2), exenatide ER (SUSTAIN 3), and titrated insulin glargine (SUSTAIN 4) for 30 or 56 weeks. 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 Subjects were followed throughout the planned trial period.

Two semaglutide maintenance dose levels (0.5 and 1.0 mg once‐weekly) were used in each trial except for SUSTAIN 3, in which only the 1.0 mg dose was used. Semaglutide was administered using a pre‐filled pen injection device. Semaglutide‐treated subjects followed a fixed‐dose escalation regimen to improve GI tolerability. The semaglutide 0.5 mg maintenance dose was reached after 4 weeks of semaglutide 0.25 mg once‐weekly, and the semaglutide 1.0 mg maintenance dose was reached after 4 weeks of semaglutide 0.25 mg once‐weekly, followed by 4 weeks of semaglutide 0.5 mg once‐weekly.

### A model-based simulation of glycaemic control and body weight when switching from semaglutide to 3.0-and 4.5-mg doses of once-weekly dulaglutide [^115sn9kW]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

To summarize, model‐based evaluations suggest that switching from semaglutide 0.5‐mg QW to dulaglutide 3.0‐mg QW and from semaglutide 1.0‐mg QW to dulaglutide 4.5‐mg QWvia stepwise dose escalation, can potentially yield additional and comparable HbA1c reduction, respectively, with greater weight loss. The ability of robust exposure‐response time‐course models developed from and validated with actual observed clinical trial data to explore a myriad of clinical dosing scenarios draws on the flexibility of modelling and simulations as tools to answer questions on prescribing scenarios, which may otherwise have to be evaluated separately with clinical trials. The learnings drawn from this model‐based approach serve to provide guidance to prescribers should a patient need to switch from QW semaglutide to dulaglutide, also given at the same weekly dosing frequency. In this scenario, model predictions showed that glycaemic control and weight benefits should be preserved, if not enhanced. The simulation results should also augment the understanding for different dosing scenarios in order to minimize the risk of losing efficacy during the transition and manage expectations for treatment outcomes.

### Semaglutide 2.4 mg for the treatment of obesity: key elements of the STEP trials 1 to 5 [^111yd7at]. Obesity (2020). Medium credibility.

There are several trials that demonstrate the promising effects of GLP‐1s in general and semaglutide in particular on WM in subpopulations of people with obesity. In the Satiety and Clinical Adiposity – Liraglutide Evidence in individuals with and without diabetes (SCALE) trial of 3,731 people without diabetes, WL was maintained at 56 weeks with liraglutide 3.0 mg versus placebo (−8.0% versus −2.6%, respectively; P < 0.001) (34). The SCALE trial of 846 people with T2D and obesity or overweight demonstrated a 6.0% (6.4‐kg) reduction of initial body weight with liraglutide 3.0 mg versus 1.8 mg and placebo (4.7% [5.0 kg] and 2.0% [2.2 kg], respectively) (35). The Semaglutide Unabated Sustainability in Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes (SUSTAIN) clinical development program, which included > 8,000 people with T2D, demonstrated that semaglutide at doses of 0.5 mg and 1.0 mg weekly offered WM benefits of 2.5 to 5.7 kg and 2.0 to 7.9 kg, respectively (36). Liraglutide and semaglutide are administered at different frequencies and doses, and over a 24‐hour period, they have distinct pharmacodynamic effects (37, 38). However, they are equally associated with transient, mild, or moderate gastrointestinal symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea (17, 39). Clinical experience shows that slowing the initial escalation of liraglutide and semaglutide helps mitigate these side effects; hence, we have designed the trials in the STEP program to have a slow titration of semaglutide over a 16‐week period.

### Once-weekly semaglutide 7. 2 mg in adults with obesity (STEP UP): a randomised, controlled, phase 3b trial [^116m7t69]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2025). High credibility.

Background

Once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2·4 mg is approved for weight management in people with obesity and related complications; however, some individuals do not reach their therapeutic goals with this dose. We aimed to test the efficacy and safety of a higher dose of semaglutide (7·2 mg) in people with obesity.

Methods

STEP UP was a phase 3b, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled and active-controlled trial conducted across 95 hospitals, specialist clinics, and medical centres in 11 countries in adults with BMI 30 kg/m 2 or greater, without diabetes. Participants were randomly assigned (5:1:1) to receive once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 7·2 mg, 2·4 mg, or placebo, with a lifestyle intervention, for 72 weeks. Coprimary endpoints were percentage change in bodyweight and the proportion of participants with a bodyweight reduction of 5% or greater for semaglutide 7·2 mg versus placebo from baseline to week 72 (treatment policy estimand). Confirmatory secondary endpoints were percentage change in bodyweight with 7·2 mg versus 2·4 mg, change in waist circumference (cm), and proportion of participants with bodyweight reductions of 10% or greater, 15% or greater, 20% or greater, and 25% or greater versus placebo, and 20% or greater and 25% or greater versus 2·4 mg. Safety was assessed in all participants who received at least one dose of the trial product. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05646706) and is now completed.

Findings

Between Jan 1, 2023, and Nov 26, 2024, 1407 participants were randomly assigned to semaglutide 7·2 mg (n = 1005), semaglutide 2·4 mg (n = 201), or placebo (n = 201). 1037 (73·7%) of 1407 participants were female, the mean age was 47 (SD 12) years, mean bodyweight was 113·0 (24·1) kg, and mean BMI was 39·9 (7·1) kg/m 2. The mean change in bodyweight was greater with semaglutide 7·2 mg versus 2·4 mg (-18·7% [SE 0·4] vs -15·6% [0·7]; estimated treatment difference [ETD] -3·1% [95% CI -4·7 to -1·6]; p < 0·0001) and with semaglutide 7·2 mg versus placebo (-18·7% [0·4] vs -3·9% [0·6]; -14·8% [-16·2 to -13·4]; p < 0·0001). Participants in the semaglutide 7·2 mg group were more likely than those in the placebo group to reach bodyweight reductions of 5% or greater (odds ratio 12·1 [95% CI 8·3 to 17·6]; p < 0·0001), 10% or greater (14·5 [9·6 to 21·9]; p < 0·0001), 15% or greater (20·3 [11·2 to 36·8]; p < 0·0001), 20% or greater (27·3 [10·9 to 68·0]; p < 0·0001), and 25% or greater (127·4 [36·8 to 441·4]; p < 0·0001); and more likely than those in the 2·4 mg group to reach bodyweight reductions of 20% or greater (1·8 [1·3 to 2·4]; p = 0·0006) and 25% or greater (2·4 [1·6 to 3·5]; p < 0·0001). Improvements in waist circumference were observed with semaglutide 7·2 mg versus placebo (ETD -11·7 cm [95% CI -13·0 to -10·4]; p < 0·0001). Gastrointestinal adverse events were more common with semaglutide 7·2 mg (711 [70·8%] of 1004) versus 2·4 mg (123 [61·2%] of 201) or placebo (86 [42·8%] of 201), as was dysaesthesia (230 [22·9%], 12 [6·0%], and one [0·5%], respectively). Serious adverse events were reported by 68 (6·8%) of 1004 participants with semaglutide 7·2 mg, 22 (10·9%) of 201 with semaglutide 2·4 mg, and 11 (5·5%) of 201 with placebo.

Interpretation

Semaglutide 7·2 mg was superior to placebo and 2·4 mg for bodyweight reduction in adults with obesity, while retaining a favourable risk-benefit profile.

### Effect of continued weekly subcutaneous semaglutide vs placebo on weight loss maintenance in adults with overweight or obesity: the STEP 4 randomized clinical trial [^112VfZbG]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Importance

The effect of continuing vs withdrawing treatment with semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist, on weight loss maintenance in people with overweight or obesity is unknown.

Objective

To compare continued once-weekly treatment with subcutaneous semaglutide, 2.4 mg, with switch to placebo for weight maintenance (both with lifestyle intervention) in adults with overweight or obesity after a 20-week run-in with subcutaneous semaglutide titrated to 2.4 mg weekly.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Randomized, double-blind, 68-week phase 3a withdrawal study conducted at 73 sites in 10 countries from June 2018 to March 2020 in adults with body mass index of at least 30 (or ≥ 27 with ≥ 1 weight-related comorbidity) and without diabetes.

Interventions

A total of 902 participants received once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide during run-in. After 20 weeks (16 weeks of dose escalation; 4 weeks of maintenance dose), 803 participants (89.0%) who reached the 2.4-mg/wk semaglutide maintenance dose were randomized (2:1) to 48 weeks of continued subcutaneous semaglutide (n = 535) or switched to placebo (n = 268), plus lifestyle intervention in both groups.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary end point was percent change in body weight from week 20 to week 68; confirmatory secondary end points were changes in waist circumference, systolic blood pressure, and physical functioning (assessed using the Short Form 36 Version 2 Health Survey, Acute Version [SF-36]).

Results

Among 803 study participants who completed the 20-week run-in period (with a mean weight loss of 10.6%) and were randomized (mean age, 46 [SD, 12] years; 634 [79%] women; mean body weight, 107.2 kg [SD, 22.7 kg]), 787 participants (98.0%) completed the trial and 741 (92.3%) completed treatment. With continued semaglutide, mean body weight change from week 20 to week 68 was -7.9% vs +6.9% with the switch to placebo (difference, -14.8 [95% CI, -16.0 to -13.5] percentage points; P < .001). Waist circumference (-9.7 cm [95% CI, -10.9 to -8.5 cm]), systolic blood pressure (-3.9 mm Hg [95% CI, -5.8 to -2.0 mm Hg]), and SF-36 physical functioning score (2.5 [95% CI, 1.6–3.3]) also improved with continued subcutaneous semaglutide vs placebo (all P < .001). Gastrointestinal events were reported in 49.1% of participants who continued subcutaneous semaglutide vs 26.1% with placebo; similar proportions discontinued treatment because of adverse events with continued semaglutide (2.4%) and placebo (2.2%).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among adults with overweight or obesity who completed a 20-week run-in period with subcutaneous semaglutide, 2.4 mg once weekly, maintaining treatment with semaglutide compared with switching to placebo resulted in continued weight loss over the following 48 weeks.

Key considerations for using once‐weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg in clinical practice (approved in Canada, Europe, the UK and the USA). Abbreviations: AE, adverse event; GI, gastrointestinal; GLP‐1RA, glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor agonist

The STEP trials excluded participants with renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate < 15 ml/min/1.73 m 2; except STEP 2, < 30 ml/min/1.73 m 2 or < 60 ml/min/1.73 m 2 with SGLT2i). However, the prescribing information states that no dose adjustment of semaglutide is recommended for patients with renal impairment.

There is limited evidence from trials and real‐world studies on strategies for managing GI side effects of GLP‐1RA treatment. Expert recommendations based on clinical experience centre around education and explanation, escalation to an appropriate dose and effective management. Patients should be counselled about the possibility of GI side effects and advised that they are typically transient and mild‐to‐moderate in severity. For mild and short‐term GI side effects, this should include providing advice on dietary modifications and recommending that patients increase their fibre and water intake for constipation and consider stool softeners. For more persistent or severe GI symptoms, pausing of dose escalation is recommended, and short‐term use of over‐the‐counter medications may be considered.

The lack of clinical trial data on switching between liraglutide 3.0 mg and semaglutide 2.4 mg in individuals with overweight or obesity precludes the development of formal evidence‐based recommendations. However, in the context of the use of GLP‐1RAs in patients with type 2 diabetes, recommendations include patient counselling, starting with the recommended dose titration (considering history of GI events with the previous GLP‐1RA), management of GI side effects and re‐evaluation of response.

Semaglutide 2.4 mg has shown clinically meaningful bodyweight reductions in obesity both in the primarily white population of the STEP 1‐5 and 8 trials, as well as in the east Asian participants of the STEP 6 trial. Furthermore, post hoc analyses from STEP 2 indicate that the response to semaglutide 2.4 mg was not influenced by race or ethnicity. However, a regional Phase IIIa trial in Brazil, China, Hong Kong and South Korea is ongoing and will further add to our knowledge on ethnicity as a potential clinical consideration.

### Suitability and usefulness of a flexible dosing timing of oral semaglutide to maximize benefit in clinical practice: an expert panel [^114Jp9iv]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Suggested Strategies for Optimal Oral Semaglutide Administration

Ensuring that patients who start oral semaglutide therapy receive comprehensive education from their healthcare provider is crucial. This education should encompass various aspects such as instructions on timing and method of administration, expectations regarding efficacy and adverse events, preventive measures to minimize the occurrence of side effects and on how to address them promptly. Thus, thorough patient education not only enhances treatment adherence but also promotes proactive management of potential challenges, ultimately promoting better overall outcomes.

The different aspects, suggested by the experts, to consider in subjects starting therapy with oral semaglutide were the following:
Patient communication Adopt specific and proactive counseling as a key component in the management of patients with T2D initiating oral semaglutide treatment. Recommend and explain the dose escalation strategy, with a starting dose of 3 mg once daily for at least 1 month, which can be then increased to 7 mg. After at least 1 month the dose can be increased to a maintenance dose of 14 mg once daily if needed to further improve glycemic control and body weight. Staying longer than 1 month on the 7-mg dose may help diluting GI side effects, but should not delay the achievement of individual targets. Inform patients about the potential occurrence of GI side effects in the initial weeks of oral semaglutide treatment, particularly during dose escalation periods. Patients should be reassured that in most cases, GI symptoms are mild to moderate and typically resolve naturally over time, encouraging them to persist on treatment.
Method and timing of administration Communicate the specific instructions related to mode of administration and their importance to patients initiating oral semaglutide treatment, to guarantee an effective drug bioavailability. Underline the necessity for a pre-dose fasting condition (enough to have an empty stomach) and observing an additional fasting period of at least 30 min post-dose, along with avoiding pharmacological interactions to allow correct semaglutide absorption. Recommend taking the medication in a time slot based on patient daily routine, when the stomach is empty. Address the patient's lifestyle and needs, to evaluate whether taking oral semaglutide after the overnight fast is the most suitable option or whether an alternative dosing time could be considered. In the latter case, provide the patients with clear written dosing instructions, regarding pre- and post-dose fasting.
Dose escalation schedule Extend the escalation periods beyond the recommended duration, if tolerability concerns arise at lower doses, i.e. maintain longer than 1 month on 7 mg before increasing the dose to 14 mg. Reduce the dose temporarily if adverse events persist and resume dose escalation once the symptoms diminish or resolve.
Presence of diseases or conditions affecting adherence and prescription of therapy. Emphasize adherence to specific administration timing recommendations, such as taking oral semaglutide before any other oral medications and waiting for at least 30 min before other oral medications.
Adherence to recommended eating behaviors for patients with T2D (details reported in Table 1).

### Effect of weekly subcutaneous semaglutide vs daily liraglutide on body weight in adults with overweight or obesity without diabetes: the STEP 8 randomized clinical trial [^114nTXgk]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Phase 3 trials have not compared semaglutide and liraglutide, glucagon-like peptide-1 analogues available for weight management.

Objective

To compare the efficacy and adverse event profiles of once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide, 2.4 mg, vs once-daily subcutaneous liraglutide, 3.0 mg (both with diet and physical activity), in people with overweight or obesity.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Randomized, open-label, 68-week, phase 3b trial conducted at 19 US sites from September 2019 (enrollment: September 11-November 26) to May 2021 (end of follow-up: May 11) in adults with body mass index of 30 or greater or 27 or greater with 1 or more weight-related comorbidities, without diabetes (N = 338).

Interventions

Participants were randomized (3:1:3:1) to receive once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide, 2.4 mg (16-week escalation; n = 126), or matching placebo, or once-daily subcutaneous liraglutide, 3.0 mg (4-week escalation; n = 127), or matching placebo, plus diet and physical activity. Participants unable to tolerate 2.4 mg of semaglutide could receive 1.7 mg; participants unable to tolerate 3.0 mg of liraglutide discontinued treatment and could restart the 4-week titration. Placebo groups were pooled (n = 85).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary end point was percentage change in body weight, and confirmatory secondary end points were achievement of 10% or more, 15% or more, and 20% or more weight loss, assessed for semaglutide vs liraglutide at week 68. Semaglutide vs liraglutide comparisons were open-label, with active treatment groups double-blinded against matched placebo groups. Comparisons of active treatments vs pooled placebo were supportive secondary end points.

Results

Of 338 randomized participants (mean [SD] age, 49 [13] years; 265 women [78.4%]; mean [SD] body weight, 104.5 [23.8] kg; mean [SD] body mass index, 37.5 [6.8]), 319 (94.4%) completed the trial, and 271 (80.2%) completed treatment. The mean weight change from baseline was -15.8% with semaglutide vs -6.4% with liraglutide (difference, -9.4 percentage points [95% CI, -12.0 to -6.8]; P < .001); weight change with pooled placebo was -1.9%. Participants had significantly greater odds of achieving 10% or more, 15% or more, and 20% or more weight loss with semaglutide vs liraglutide (70.9% of participants vs 25.6% [odds ratio, 6.3 {95% CI, 3.5 to 11.2}], 55.6% vs 12.0% [odds ratio, 7.9 {95% CI, 4.1 to 15.4}], and 38.5% vs 6.0% [odds ratio, 8.2 {95% CI, 3.5 to 19.1}], respectively; all P < .001). Proportions of participants discontinuing treatment for any reason were 13.5% with semaglutide and 27.6% with liraglutide. Gastrointestinal adverse events were reported by 84.1% with semaglutide and 82.7% with liraglutide.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among adults with overweight or obesity without diabetes, once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide compared with once-daily subcutaneous liraglutide, added to counseling for diet and physical activity, resulted in significantly greater weight loss at 68 weeks.

### Two-year effects of semaglutide in adults with overweight or obesity: the STEP 5 trial [^113tKXBr]. Nature Medicine (2022). Excellent credibility.

The safety profile of semaglutide 2.4 mg in STEP 5 was consistent with that in other STEP program trials, and with the GLP-1 receptor agonist class in general. Gastrointestinal disorders were the most common adverse events with semaglutide, typically transient, of mild-to-moderate severity, occurring during dose escalation, and infrequently leading to treatment discontinuation.

Strengths of STEP 5 include the high rates of adherence to treatment and completion of the trial (which contributed to consistency in findings between the two estimands). Limitations include the low proportion of nonwhite participants and the preponderance of female participants. In addition, while the homogenous nature of the prescribed dietary intake deficit, physical activity goal and counseling frequency provided consistency, it may not fully reflect the need for approaches tailored to the health profiles of individuals or to different populations in clinical practice; however, beyond adherence to the stipulated criteria for counseling on diet and physical activity, behavioral intervention was delivered by each study site with no further direction, allowing a degree of local tailoring and aiding real-world applicability.

In conclusion, treatment with once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide in conjunction with behavioral intervention in adults with overweight (with at least one weight-related comorbidity) or obesity (without diabetes) was associated with clinically ﻿﻿impactful and sustained weight loss of 15.2% at week 104, along with improvements in weight-related cardiometabolic risk factors.

Semaglutide (Wegovy)

The Semaglutide Treatment Effect in People with Obesity (STEP) trials evaluated the efficacy and safety of Semaglutide 2.4 mg weekly compared to placebo, for a duration of 68 weeks each. The study population included men and women with overweight/obesity with at least one treated or untreated weight-related comorbidity. The range of mean BMI was 37.8–38.4 kg/m 2. For STEP 1 trial, the mean age of all participants was 46.0 years, and 74% were women. The STEP 1 trial included individual counseling sessions every 4 weeks to help with the adherence to a reduced calorie diet of 500 kcal deficit and an increased physical activity prescription of 150 min per week. STEP 1 trial reported a weight reduction of 14.8% in the intervention group (n = 1306), compared to a reduction of 2.4% in the placebo group (n = 655); SD not available (Fig. 2). Dropout rates was not reported. In STEP 4-Maintenance trial, mean age was 46.0 years, and 79% were women. Participants were prescribed a reduced-calorie diet (500-kcal/d deficit relative to estimated energy expenditure) and increased physical activity (150 min/wk) in addition to Semaglutide 2.4 mg weekly for 20 weeks, after which mean body weight of participants dropped by 10.6%. Participants were then randomized to semaglutide 2.4 mg (n = 535) or placebo (n = 268). After randomization, Semaglutide group achieved a weight reduction of 7.9 (8.3) % while the placebo group had a weight gain of 6.9 (8.8) % (Fig. 2). Dropout rate for both arms was very low of 0.8%.STEP 3- IBT trial included 611 participants, mean age 46 years, and 81% were women. All participants received a low-calorie diet prescription of 1000–1200 kcal followed by a hypocaloric diet of 1200–1800 kcal, in addition to a physical activity prescription. Participants also received individual IBT visits with a registered dietitian. In the intervention group (n = 407), weight reduction was 16.0%, while in the placebo group (n = 204) weight reduction was 5.7%, SD not available. Patients with DM in the STEP 2 trial had a baseline characteristics profile similar to other STEP trials in terms of mean age, range of percent females, mean body weight, mean BMI, mean blood pressure (systolic and diastolic), and coexisting conditions at the time of screening. At 68 weeks, the STEP 2 trial achieved a significant total body weight loss (percent total body weight loss 9.6 (8.0) % in semaglutide 2.4 mg; 7.0 (8.0) % in semaglutide 1.0 mg, 3.0 (8.0) % in placebo, p < 0.0001 between both arms and between semaglutide 1.0 mg and placebo). Compliance data was not reported, and the dropout rate was remarkably low in the STEP studies, ranging from 0 to 6%. The adverse events observed in more than 10% of the population in the main trials for approval of this drug include GI symptoms such as nausea, dyspepsia, vomiting, flatulence, diarrhea, abdominal pain, abdominal distention, or constipation; infections and infestations such as upper respiratory tract infections, urinary tract infection, and nasopharyngitis; musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders such as back pain; and symptoms of the nervous system such as dizziness and headaches (Table 1).

### Semaglutide for the treatment of overweight and obesity: a review [^112e2hLh]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

STEP 8was a head‐to‐head comparison in which participants were randomized to receive once‐weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg or matching placebo, or once‐daily liraglutide 3.0 mg or matching placebo for 68 weeks.

All trials followed the same dose‐escalation regimen. Participants treated with subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg were initiated on a dose of 0.25 mg once weekly and the dose was escalated every 4 weeks to 0.5 mg, 1.0 mg and 1.7 mg, until the target dose of 2.4 mg was reached at week 16. If participants were unable to tolerate the 2.4 mg dose because of adverse events (AEs), lower maintenance doses were permitted if the participant would otherwise discontinue trial treatment completely. It was recommended that participants made at least one attempt to re‐escalate to the recommended target dose. Diet and physical activity (lifestyle intervention) were recorded daily in a diary or by use of a smartphone application or other tools, reviewed during counselling sessions.

4.1 Estimands used to assess treatment efficacy

In line with regulatory guidance, the STEP trials were designed to report results using two estimands. The treatment policy (primary) estimand assessed effects regardless of treatment discontinuation or rescue medication, while the secondary trial product estimand modelled treatment effects in all randomly assigned participants, assuming they had remained on treatment for the duration of the trials, and without initiation of rescue medication. The data reported in this review are based on the primary treatment policy estimand, since the statistical analyses were performed using this approach. Results using the two estimands were largely consistent.

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

Adverse Reactions in Clinical Trials in Adults with Obesity or Overweight for Weight Reduction

WEGOVY 2.4 mg Subcutaneous Weekly Dosage

WEGOVY was evaluated for safety in 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials that included 2,116 adult patients with obesity or overweight treated with 2.4 mg WEGOVY for up to 68 weeks and a 7-week off-drug follow-up period [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. Baseline characteristics included a mean age of 48 years, 71% female, 72% White, 14% Asian, 9% Black or African American, and 5% reported as other or unknown; and 85% were not Hispanic or Latino ethnicity, 13% were Hispanic or Latino ethnicity, and 2% reported as unknown. The baseline characteristics were 42% with hypertension, 19% with type 2 diabetes, 43% with dyslipidemia, 28% with a BMI greater than 40 kg/m2, and 4% with CV disease.

In these clinical trials, 6.8% of patients treated with 2.4 mg WEGOVY and 3.2% of patients treated with placebo permanently discontinued treatment as a result of adverse reactions. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were nausea (1.8% versus 0.2%), vomiting (1.2% versus 0%), and diarrhea (0.7% versus 0.1%) for WEGOVY and placebo, respectively.

### Effect of semaglutide 2.4 mg on use of antihypertensive and lipid-lowering treatment in five randomized controlled STEP trials [^114gdXYy]. Obesity (2025). Medium credibility.

METHODS

The safety and efficacy of semaglutide 2.4 mg were assessed in adults aged ≥ 18 years with overweight or obesity and with or without T2D in US‐ or global‐based, blinded, randomized, placebo‐controlled, phase 3 STEP clinical trials. This analysis includes data from STEP 1, 2, 3, 6, and 8 (identifiers: STEP 1, NCT03548935; STEP 2, NCT03552757; STEP 3, NCT03611582, STEP 6: NCT03811574; and STEP 8: NCT04074161). Data from STEP 1, 3, 6 (which excluded those with T2D), and 8 were pooled due to similarities in study designs and populations (which included people with overweight or obesity). Data from participants in STEP 2 and 6 (which included people with overweight or obesity and T2D) were pooled and analyzed separately. People treated with semaglutide 1.7 mg in STEP 6 or treated with liraglutide 3.0 mg in STEP 8 were excluded from this analysis. Owing to differences in trial characteristics (i.e. population, design, or duration), other STEP trials were not included in the analysis. All STEP trials were conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice guidelines. The protocols and amendments were approved by an independent ethics committee or institutional review board at each study site. The trials were designed and overseen by a steering group of clinical professionals, including representatives from the trial sponsor.

1, 2, 3, 6, and 8 trial design

The STEP 1, 2, 3, 6, and 8 trial designs, including participant eligibility, locations, sample sizes, randomization, blinding, and statistical methods, have been previously published. Key details, including cohort descriptions, randomization, dose escalation, behavioral and lifestyle requirements, primary and secondary endpoints, and safety assessments, are summarized for all relevant trials in Table S1. Data on antihypertensive and lipid‐lowering medications were collected in all trials. Changes to medications were based on medical judgments by site investigators and reported changes in "treatment intensity" (i.e. increase or decrease in dose or addition or discontinuation of medication).

2.3 Drug administration

Semaglutide and semaglutide placebo were administered by once‐weekly subcutaneous injections in the thigh, abdomen or upper arm, and were to be taken on the same day of the week irrespective of meals. Participants followed a fixed‐dose escalation regimen starting from a dose of 0.25 mg and the dose doubled every 4 weeks until the maintenance dose was achieved. Doses were not to be changed during the trial after the semaglutide maintenance dose had been reached. Sitagliptin and sitagliptin placebo were provided as tablets and were to be administered orally once‐daily irrespective of meals. Metformin dose or dosing frequency was not to be changed during the treatment period, unless rescue medication was needed. Rescue medication was offered if fasting plasma glucose (FPG) exceeded predefined criteria (Table S3).

### High-dose once-weekly semaglutide: a new option for obesity management [^116HD88u]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To review the pharmacology, efficacy, and safety of high-dose once-weekly semaglutide for chronic weight management.

Data Sources

PubMed/MEDLINE and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched (inception to September 8, 2021) using keywords "semaglutide" and "obesity", "weight", "high dose", "high-dose", or "2.4".

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Clinical trials with published results were included. Publications studying the oral or < 2.4 mg formulation of semaglutide were excluded.

Data Synthesis

Four phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind trials demonstrated efficacy of high-dose once-weekly semaglutide compared with placebo for weight loss. Study populations included patients with overweight or obesity (STEP 1, STEP 3, and STEP 4) or patients with diabetes and with overweight or obesity (STEP 2). Lifestyle interventions for diet and exercise were included for all participants. Weight loss from baseline was significant for all studies, and secondary outcomes demonstrated cardiometabolic improvements including waist circumference, systolic blood pressure, and lipid profiles. Gastrointestinal adverse effects were common, but the medication was otherwise well tolerated.

Relevance To Patient Care and Clinical Practice

High-dose semaglutide offers significant weight-lowering potential and favorable effects on cardiometabolic risk factors and glycemic indices. Clinicians and patients should consider the route and frequency of administration, adverse effect profile, and cost when choosing an antiobesity medication. The importance of concomitant lifestyle interventions should be emphasized.

Conclusions

High-dose once-weekly semaglutide can significantly reduce weight, and although gastrointestinal adverse effects were common, it is generally well tolerated.

3.9 endpoints

The PK profile for semaglutide was as expected, supporting compliance with the treatment regimen during the trial (mean [coefficient of variation (CV)] AUC 0‐168h: 4467 [17.7] nmol × h/L; C max: 32.0 [19.1] nmol/L; t max: 33.2 [59.8] hours). Mean trough values (CV) for individual semaglutide dosages were: 0.25 mg, 4.64 (32.5) nmol/L; 0.5 mg, 10.25 (23.3) nmol/L; 1.0 mg, 19.73 (21.9) nmol/L.

3.10 Safety

AEs were reported more frequently with semaglutide vs placebo. All AEs were mild or moderate in severity; no serious AEs were reported. The most common AEs were GI events. Two AEs led to withdrawal from the trial during semaglutide treatment. No severe or blood glucose‐confirmed symptomatic hypoglycaemic events were reported. Observed systolic and diastolic blood pressure were stable throughout the trial for subjects receiving either treatment; at week 12, observed mean changes from baseline were within 2 mm Hg.

Dosing and tolerability of weekly NuSh agents — semaglutide and tirzepatide are dosed once weekly, and all agents require dose titration to minimize largely gastrointestinal adverse effects; slow titration mitigates intolerance, and for patients with adverse effects, decreasing the dose to a previously tolerated dose is recommended. In clinical trials, 4.3% to 7.1% of participants discontinued therapy due to adverse events. Among published clinical trials, the longest duration of treatment with a NuSh (liraglutide) was 3.8 years, and observational data across 5 years suggest that GLP-1 receptor agonists are effective; given that obesity is a chronic disease, weight regain after discontinuation of therapy is expected. Access and affordability challenges can lead to missed doses; should a patient miss doses due to lack of access, strategies exist to guide therapeutic interchanges, and if ≥ 3 missed dosages of once-weekly semaglutide or tirzepatide occur, a dose reduction may be considered.

14.2 Weight Reduction and Long-term Maintenance Studies in Adults with Obesity or Overweight

Overview of Clinical Studies in Adults The safety and efficacy of WEGOVY for weight reduction and long-term maintenance of body weight in conjunction with a reduced calorie diet and increased physical activity were studied in three 68-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials; one 68-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo withdrawal trial; and one 68-week, randomized, double-blind trial that investigated 2 different doses of WEGOVY versus placebo. In Studies 2 (NCT#03548935), 3 (NCT#03552757), and 4 (NCT#03611582), WEGOVY or matching placebo was escalated to 2.4 mg subcutaneous weekly during a 16-week period followed by 52 weeks on maintenance dose. In Study 5 (NCT#03548987), WEGOVY was escalated during a 20-week run-in period, and patients who reached a WEGOVY 2.4 mg subcutaneous weekly dosage after the run-in period were randomized to either continued treatment with WEGOVY or placebo for 48 weeks. In Study 6 (NCT#03811574), WEGOVY was escalated to 1.7 mg or 2.4 mg subcutaneous weekly dosages or placebo over 12 to 16 weeks followed by 52 weeks on either maintenance dose.

The study STEP 8 was published by Domenica M Rubino and colleagues in 2022 in the journal JAMA. This study is related to the following diseases: Obesity. In the STEP 8 study, the trial question was: is weekly subcutaneous semaglutide superior to daily liraglutide in adults with overweight or obesity without diabetes? In the STEP 8 study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the STEP 8 study, the population was: 338 patients (265 female, 73 male). The inclusion criteria were non-diabetic adults with a BMI of ≥ 30, or BMI of ≥ 27 plus at least one weight-related comorbidity. The key exclusion criteria were HbA1c ≥ 48 mmol/mol; history of type 1 or T2DM mellitus; self-reported change in body weight ≥ 5 kg at 90 days of screening. In the STEP 8 study, the interventions were: n = 126 semaglutide (initiated at 0.25 mg SC once weekly for the first 4 weeks and titrated every 4 weeks to the maintenance dose of 2.4 mg once weekly by week 16, or 1.7 mg once weekly if not tolerated, for a total of 67 weeks) n = 127 liraglutide (initiated at 0.6 mg SC daily and titrated over 4 weeks to the maintenance dose of 3 mg daily for a total of 67 weeks). In the STEP 8 study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in reduction in body weight (15.8% vs. 6.4%; AD 9.4%, 95% CI 6.8 to 12). In the STEP 8 study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in patients achieving a weight reduction of ≥ 10% (70.9% vs. 25.6%; OR 6.3, 95% CI 3.5 to 11.2) Significant increase in patients achieving a weight reduction of ≥ 15% (55.6% vs. 12%; OR 7.9, 95% CI 4.1 to 15.4) Significant increase in patients achieving a weight reduction of ≥ 20% (38.5% vs. 6%; OR 8.2, 95% CI 3.5 to 19.1). In the STEP 8 study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in gastrointestinal adverse events. In the STEP 8 study, the conclusion was: in non-diabetic adults with a BMI of ≥ 30, or BMI of ≥ 27 plus at least one weight-related comorbidity, semaglutide was superior to liraglutide with respect to reduction in body weight.

### Suitability and usefulness of a flexible dosing timing of oral semaglutide to maximize benefit in clinical practice: an expert panel [^1153SKGf]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

From clinical trials and observational data, oral semaglutide has proven to be the most effective second-line oral therapy for the management of patients with type 2 diabetes. This review aims to describe the perspective of an Italian expert panel that addressed the potential challenges arising during the use of oral semaglutide in the free-living conditions of routine clinical care. A group of Italian experts discussed and generated insights into the use of oral semaglutide in clinical practice. Key topics included the effectiveness of oral semaglutide in clinical practice, the positioning of the agent to optimize the treatment benefits, the possibility to adopt flexibility in the administration schedule, critical issues encountered, the role of patient communication and information in the importance of dose escalation and management of adverse events. Available data on efficacy and effectiveness of oral semaglutide from randomized clinical trials and real-world studies were reported, along with factors that determine tolerability and persistence on treatment. The debate over a fixed versus a flexible dosing schedule was critically addressed, providing anecdotical clues from a small case series and a real-world database. Additionally, a set of recommendations for clinicians to consider when prescribing oral semaglutide and during the process of patient monitoring were provided.

### Tirzepatide as compared with semaglutide for the treatment of obesity [^115Judms]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

Background

Tirzepatide and semaglutide are highly effective medications for obesity management. The efficacy and safety of tirzepatide as compared with semaglutide in adults with obesity but without type 2 diabetes is unknown.

Methods

In this phase 3b, open-label, controlled trial, adult participants with obesity but without type 2 diabetes were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive the maximum tolerated dose of tirzepatide (10 mg or 15 mg) or the maximum tolerated dose of semaglutide (1.7 mg or 2.4 mg) subcutaneously once weekly for 72 weeks. The primary end point was the percent change in weight from baseline to week 72. Key secondary end points included weight reductions of at least 10%, 15%, 20%, and 25% and a change in waist circumference from baseline to week 72.

Results

A total of 751 participants underwent randomization. The least-squares mean percent change in weight at week 72 was -20.2% (95% confidence interval [CI] -21.4 to -19.1) with tirzepatide and -13.7% (95% CI, -14.9 to -12.6) with semaglutide (P < 0.001). The least-squares mean change in waist circumference was -18.4 cm (95% CI, -19.6 to -17.2) with tirzepatide and -13.0 cm (95% CI, -14.3 to -11.7) with semaglutide (P < 0.001). Participants in the tirzepatide group were more likely than those in the semaglutide group to have weight reductions of at least 10%, 15%, 20%, and 25%. The most common adverse events in both treatment groups were gastrointestinal, and most were mild to moderate in severity and occurred primarily during dose escalation.

Conclusions

Among participants with obesity but without diabetes, treatment with tirzepatide was superior to treatment with semaglutide with respect to reduction in body weight and waist circumference at week 72. (Funded by Eli Lilly; SURMOUNT-5 ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT05822830.).

### Efficacy and safety of once-weekly semaglutide 2. 4 mg versus placebo in people with obesity and prediabetes (STEP 10): a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre phase 3 trial [^116q1KEX]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2024). High credibility.

Background

There are currently limited data regarding the effect of semaglutide 2·4 mg in individuals with obesity and prediabetes in clinical trials. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of semaglutide 2·4 mg for weight management and glycaemic control in participants with obesity and prediabetes.

Methods

STEP 10 was a randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, phase 3 trial done across 30 trial sites in Canada, Denmark, Finland, Spain, and the UK and included participants aged 18 years or older with a BMI of 30 kg/m 2 or higher and prediabetes according to UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence criteria (defined as having at least one of the following at screening: HbA 1c of 6·0–6·4% [42–47 mmol/mol] or fasting plasma glucose [FPG] of 5·5–6·9 mmol/L). Participants were randomly assigned (2:1) to once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2·4 mg or placebo with diet and physical activity counselling for 52 weeks, followed by a 28-week off-treatment period. Primary endpoints were percentage change in bodyweight and proportion of participants reverting to normoglycaemia (HbA 1c < 6·0% [< 42 mmol/mol] and FPG < 5·5 mmol/L) at week 52 (assessed in all randomly assigned participants by intention to treat). Selective safety data were collected for participants who received at least one dose of study drug. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT05040971, and is complete.

Findings

Between Sept 16 and Dec 29, 2021, 138 participants were randomly assigned to semaglutide 2·4 mg and 69 to placebo. 147 (71%) were female and 60 (29%) were male; 183 (88%) were White. All randomly assigned participants received at least one dose of study drug. Baseline mean age was 53 years (SD 11), bodyweight 111·6 kg (22·2), BMI 40·1 kg/m 2 (6·9), waist circumference 120·1 cm (14·7), HbA 1c 5·9% (0·3; 41·3 mmol/mol [3·0]), and FPG 5·9 mmol/L (0·6). There was a significantly greater reduction in bodyweight with semaglutide 2·4 mg than with placebo at week 52 (-13·9% [SD 0·7] vs -2·7% [0·6]; estimated treatment difference -11·2% [95% CI -13·0 to -9·4]; p < 0·0001). Greater proportions of participants reverted to normoglycaemia at week 52 with semaglutide 2·4 mg than with placebo (103 [81%] of 127 vs nine [14%] of 64; odds ratio 19·8 [95% CI 8·7 to 45·2]; p < 0·0001). Serious adverse events occurred in 12 (9%) participants receiving semaglutide 2·4 mg versus six (9%) receiving placebo. Adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation occurred in eight (6%) participants in the semaglutide 2·4 mg group versus one (1%) participant in the placebo group. No new safety signals were reported.

Interpretation

Semaglutide 2·4 mg provided superior reduction in bodyweight and reversion to normoglycaemia versus placebo in participants with obesity and prediabetes. The safety and tolerability profile was consistent with previous studies and with the GLP-1 receptor agonist class. These findings support the potential use of semaglutide 2·4 mg as a treatment option for individuals with obesity and prediabetes to achieve reversion to normoglycaemia.

8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of WEGOVY in combination with a reduced calorie diet and increased physical activity to reduce excess body weight and maintain weight reduction long term in pediatric patients aged 12 years and older with obesity have been established. Use of WEGOVY for this indication is supported by a 68-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in 201 pediatric patients aged 12 years and older with a BMI corresponding to ≥ 95th percentile for age and sex [see Clinical Studies (14.3)] and from trials in adult patients with obesity [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. Use of the 1.7 mg once weekly maintenance dosage of WEGOVY in pediatric patients is also supported by additional exposure-efficacy and safety analyses in pooled adult and pediatric patients.

Adverse reactions with WEGOVY treatment in pediatric patients aged 12 years and older were generally similar to those reported in adults. Pediatric patients aged 12 years and older treated with WEGOVY had greater incidences of cholelithiasis, cholecystitis, hypotension, rash, and urticaria compared to adults treated with WEGOVY [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

There are insufficient data in pediatric patients with type 2 diabetes treated with WEGOVY for obesity to determine if there is an increased risk of hypoglycemia with WEGOVY treatment similar to that reported in adults. Inform patients of the risk of hypoglycemia and educate them on the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia. In pediatric patients aged 12 years and older with type 2 diabetes, monitor blood glucose prior to starting WEGOVY and during WEGOVY treatment. When initiating WEGOVY in pediatric patients aged 12 years and older with type 2 diabetes, consider reducing the dose of concomitantly administered insulin secretagogue (such as sulfonylureas) or insulin to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

The safety and effectiveness of WEGOVY have not been established in pediatric patients:

To reduce the risk of major adverse CV events. Clinical trials for this indication are highly impracticable because of the low prevalence of the condition in pediatric patients.
To reduce excess body weight and maintain weight reduction long term in those less than 12 years of age.
For the treatment of noncirrhotic MASH.

### Semaglutide s.C. once-weekly in type 2 diabetes: a population pharmacokinetic analysis [^113VwmB8]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

All procedures performed in studies involving human participants were in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional and/or national research committee and with the 1964 Helsinki Declaration and its later amendments and Good Clinical Practice. The trial protocols were approved by independent ethics committees and/or institutional review boards. All subjects provided written informed consent before initiation of any trial-related activities.

Subjects included in the population pharmacokinetic analysis were randomized to a maintenance dose of either 0.5 mg or 1.0 mg semaglutide once weekly. SUSTAIN 3 used only the 1.0 mg maintenance dose for the semaglutide treatment arm (Table 1). In all trials, subjects taking semaglutide followed a dose-escalation regimen with the aim of minimizing gastrointestinal adverse events common to the class of GLP-1RAs. Subjects started with 4 weeks of treatment with 0.25 mg semaglutide once weekly before escalating to 0.5 mg semaglutide once weekly. Subjects randomized to the 1.0 mg semaglutide treatment arm would escalate to the 1.0 mg dose after 4 weeks of 0.5 mg semaglutide, remaining on this dose for the duration of the trial. The subcutaneous injections should be administered on the same day of each week, and subjects providing blood samples to be used in the population pharmacokinetic model were encouraged to inject in the same area of the body throughout the trial.

### Semaglutide: a new drug for the treatment of obesity [^116YMpo5]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2023). Medium credibility.

Semaglutide (▼Ozempic solution for injection, ▼Rybelsus tablets-Novo Nordisk) was initially granted market authorisation for the treatment of type 2 diabetes as an adjunct to diet and exercise. In 2021 and 2022, regulatory agencies in the USA and Europe licensed semaglutide (▼Wegovy solution for injection-Novo Nordisk) for the treatment of individuals who are obese, or overweight and who have at least one weight-related comorbidity. Manufacturer-sponsored randomised controlled trials have shown a loss of almost 12% of body weight over a 68-week period, however, once the medication is stopped people regain most of their pretreatment weight. Gastrointestinal adverse events occur commonly with semaglutide, and pancreatitis, diabetic retinopathy and severe allergic reactions have also been reported. Extensive hype in social and general media has resulted in increased demand for semaglutide leading to supply problems across the various licensed products including those used for treatment of diabetes. In the UK, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence has recommended semaglutide as an option for weight management for a maximum treatment duration of 2 years. Further studies are underway to assess the effect of semaglutide on longer-term health benefits.

### Efficacy and safety of semaglutide compared with liraglutide and placebo for weight loss in patients with obesity: a randomised, double-blind, placebo and active controlled, dose-ranging, phase 2 trial [^113bU4Z9]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Background

Obesity is a major public health issue, and new pharmaceuticals for weight management are needed. Therefore, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue semaglutide in comparison with liraglutide and a placebo in promoting weight loss.

Methods

We did a randomised, double-blind, placebo and active controlled, multicentre, dose-ranging, phase 2 trial. The study was done in eight countries involving 71 clinical sites. Eligible participants were adults (≥ 18 years) without diabetes and with a body-mass index (BMI) of 30 kg/m 2 or more. We randomly assigned participants (6:1) to each active treatment group (ie, semaglutide [0·05 mg, 0·1 mg, 0·2 mg, 0·3 mg, or 0·4 mg; initiated at 0·05 mg per day and incrementally escalated every 4 weeks] or liraglutide [3·0 mg; initiated at 0·6 mg per day and escalated by 0·6 mg per week]) or matching placebo group (equal injection volume and escalation schedule to active treatment group) using a block size of 56. All treatment doses were delivered once-daily via subcutaneous injections. Participants and investigators were masked to the assigned study treatment but not the target dose. The primary endpoint was percentage weight loss at week 52. The primary analysis was done using intention-to-treat ANCOVA estimation with missing data derived from the placebo pool. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02453711.

Findings

Between Oct 1, 2015, and Feb 11, 2016, 957 individuals were randomly assigned (102–103 participants per active treatment group and 136 in the pooled placebo group). Mean baseline characteristics included age 47 years, bodyweight 111·5 kg, and BMI 39·3 kg/m 2. Bodyweight data were available for 891 (93%) of 957 participants at week 52. Estimated mean weight loss was -2·3% for the placebo group versus -6·0% (0·05 mg), -8·6% (0·1 mg), -11·6% (0·2 mg), -11·2% (0·3 mg), and -13·8% (0·4 mg) for the semaglutide groups. All semaglutide groups versus placebo were significant (unadjusted p ≤ 0·0010), and remained significant after adjustment for multiple testing (p ≤ 0·0055). Mean bodyweight reductions for 0·2 mg or more of semaglutide versus liraglutide were all significant (-13·8% to -11·2% vs -7·8%). Estimated weight loss of 10% or more occurred in 10% of participants receiving placebo compared with 37–65% receiving 0·1 mg or more of semaglutide (p < 0·0001 vs placebo). All semaglutide doses were generally well tolerated, with no new safety concerns. The most common adverse events were dose-related gastrointestinal symptoms, primarily nausea, as seen previously with GLP-1 receptor agonists.

Interpretation

In combination with dietary and physical activity counselling, semaglutide was well tolerated over 52 weeks and showed clinically relevant weight loss compared with placebo at all doses.

Acute Kidney Injury

Acute kidney injury occurred in clinical trials for weight reduction in 7 adult patients (0.4 cases per 100 patient years) receiving WEGOVY versus 4 patients (0.2 cases per 100 patient years of exposure) receiving placebo. Some of these adverse reactions occurred in association with gastrointestinal adverse reactions or dehydration. In addition, 2 patients treated with WEGOVY had acute kidney injury with dehydration in other clinical trials. The risk of renal adverse reactions with WEGOVY was increased in adult patients with a history of renal impairment (trials included 65 patients with a history of moderate or severe renal impairment at baseline), and occurred more frequently during dose titration.

Retinal Disorders in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes

In a trial of adult patients with type 2 diabetes and BMI greater than or equal to 27 kg/m2for weight reduction, retinal disorders were reported by 6.9% of patients treated with WEGOVY (semaglutide 2.4 mg), 6.2% of patients treated with semaglutide 1 mg, and 4.2% of patients treated with placebo. The majority of events were reported as diabetic retinopathy (4%, 2.7%, and 2.7%, respectively) and non-proliferative retinopathy (0.7%, 0%, and 0%, respectively).

Increase in Heart Rate

Mean increases in resting heart rate of 1 to 4 beats per minute (bpm) were observed with routine clinical monitoring in WEGOVY-treated adult patients compared to placebo in clinical trials for weight reduction. In weight reduction trials in which adult patients were randomized prior to dose-escalation, more patients treated with WEGOVY, compared with placebo, had maximum changes from baseline at any visit of 10 to 19 bpm (41% versus 34%, respectively) and 20 bpm or more (26% versus 16%, respectively). In a clinical trial for weight reduction in pediatric patients aged 12 years and older with normal baseline heart rate, more patients treated with WEGOVY compared to placebo had maximum changes in heart rate of 20 bpm or more (54% versus 39%).

Hypotension and Syncope

Adverse reactions related to hypotension (hypotension, orthostatic hypotension, and decreased blood pressure) were reported in 1.3% of WEGOVY-treated adult patients versus 0.4% of placebo-treated patients and syncope was reported in 0.8% of WEGOVY-treated patients versus 0.2% of placebo-treated patients in clinical trials for weight reduction. Some reactions were related to gastrointestinal adverse reactions and volume loss associated with WEGOVY. Hypotension and orthostatic hypotension were more frequently seen in patients on concomitant antihypertensive therapy. In a clinical trial in pediatric patients aged 12 years and older for weight reduction, hypotension was reported in 2.3% of WEGOVY-treated patients versus 0% in placebo-treated patients.

6.2 Key clinical considerations for using once‐weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg in clinical practice

Currently, once‐weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg is approved for use in Canada, Europe, the UK and the USA as an adjunct to a reduced calorie diet and increased physical activity for chronic weight management in adults with an initial BMI of ≥ 30 or ≥ 27 kg/m 2 in the presence of ≥ 1 weight‐related comorbid condition.,

Figure 1 illustrates key considerations for the use of once‐weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg in clinical practice. Semaglutide should be initiated at a dose of 0.25 mg once weekly and then escalated every 4 weeks according to the dose‐escalation schedule in Figure 1, until the maintenance dose of 2.4 mg once weekly is reached. This escalation schedule is designed to minimize GI AEs, but if a patient does not tolerate a dose during the escalation period, the subsequent escalation step can be delayed for a further 4 weeks, after which it should be re‐escalated to 2.4 mg. If needed, this re‐escalation step can be postponed (e.g. for 4 more weeks) and the escalation can be stopped at a lower maintenance dose where AEs are tolerable. In patients with type 2 diabetes, blood glucose should be monitored prior to starting and during treatment with semaglutide 2.4 mg.

### Once-weekly semaglutide in adults with overweight or obesity [^112Zwtm3]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2021). Excellent credibility.

The study STEP 1 was published by John P H Wilding and colleagues in 2021 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Obesity. In the STEP 1 study, the trial question was: what is the role of once weekly semaglutide as an adjunct to lifestyle intervention in adults with overweight or obesity? In the STEP 1 study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the STEP 1 study, the population was: 1961 patients (1453 female, 508 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with a BMI of ≥ 30 (or ≥ 27 with ≥ 1 weight-related coexisting condition) who did not have diabetes. The key exclusion criteria were HbA1c ≥ 6.5%, self-reported change in body weight > 5 kg (11 lbs) within 90 days before screening, previous treatment with glucose-lowering agents or any antiobesity medications within the past 90 days before screening. In the STEP 1 study, the interventions were: n = 1306 semaglutide (initiated at 0.25 mg SC once weekly for the first 4 weeks and titrated every 4 weeks to the maintenance dose of 2.4 mg once weekly by week 16, plus diet and physical activity counseling) n = 655 placebo (matching placebo once weekly plus diet and physical activity counseling). In the STEP 1 study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in relative weight reduction at week 68 (14.9% vs. 2.4%; AD 12.4%, 95% CI 11.5 to 13.4). In the STEP 1 study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in the percentage of patients achieving a weight reduction of ≥ 10% at week 68 (69.1% vs. 12%; OR 14.7, 95% CI 11.1 to 19.4) Significant increase in the percentage of patients achieving a reduction in weight by ≥ 15% at week 68 (50.5% vs. 4.9%; OR 19.3, 95% CI 12.9 to 28.8) Significant increase in absolute weight reduction from baseline to week 68 (15.3 kg vs. 2.6 kg; AD 12.7 kg, 95% CI 11.7 to 13.7). In the STEP 1 study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in overall adverse events. significant differences in serious adverse events (9.8% vs. 6.4%), gastrointestinal disorders (74.2% vs. 47.9%), treatment discontinuation due to gastrointestinal events (4.5% vs. 0.8%). In the STEP 1 study, the conclusion was: in patients with a BMI of ≥ 30 (or ≥ 27 with ≥ 1 weight-related coexisting condition) who did not have diabetes, semaglutide was superior to placebo with respect to relative weight reduction at week 68.

### Gradual titration of semaglutide results in better treatment adherence and fewer adverse events: a randomized controlled open-label pilot study examining a 16-week flexible titration regimen versus label-recommended 8-week semaglutide titration regimen [^115p9Ldh]. Diabetes Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To determine whether a slower, flexible titration regimen of semaglutide would improve adherence and reduce gastrointestinal adverse events (GI-AEs) compared with the label-recommended regimen in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D).

Research Design and Methods

A total of 104 patients with T2D were randomized to label-recommended titration (0.25 mg, 0.5 mg, 1 mg at 4-week intervals) or flexible titration (starting at 0.0675 mg [measured as five clicks made by the dose selector dial], with gradual increases by 0.0675 mg/week and delays for GI-AEs) for 26 weeks.

Results

While final doses were similar between groups, only 2% of patients in the flexible arm withdrew due to GI-AEs vs. 19% in the label arm (P = 0.005). The flexible arm reported less nausea (45.1% vs. 64.2%; P = 0.051) and asthenia (9.8% vs. 24.5%; P = 0.047), with fewer days experiencing nausea (2.88 vs. 6.3 days; P = 0.017). HbA1c and BMI changes were similar between groups.

Conclusions

Slower, flexible titration improved adherence and reduced adverse events without compromising efficacy.

### What is the pipeline for future medications for obesity? [^112hcC6o]. International Journal of Obesity (2025). Medium credibility.

Adverse events with oral GLP-1 RA

Similar to injectable GLP-1 RA, the most common AE with oral GLP-1 RA were gastrointestinal which were mild to moderate in severity (Tables 2 and 3, safety outcomes). In the OASIS-1 study, 13% of participants (people with obesity without diabetes) receiving oral semaglutide 50 mg experienced "altered skin sensation" events compared to 1% with placebo - these events were generally mild to moderate in severity, occurred during dose escalation to the higher doses and resolved without requiring permanent treatment discontinuation. The "altered skin sensation" has not been reported in the PIONEER-PLUS study or with injectable semaglutide 2.4 mg and its aetiology will need to be explored further in future studies.

AE leading to discontinuation of treatment were 6–13% with semaglutide 50 mg once daily in phase 3 trials (vs. 4–10% with placebo) and 10–21% with orforglipron in phase 2 trials (vs. 2–6% with placebo, Tables 2 and 3). The percentages of participants who experienced AE leading to treatment discontinuation as well as of those who experienced gastrointestinal AE with oral semaglutide 50 mg (Tables 2 and 3) were similar to those observed with subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg (in STEP-1 and STEP-2 trials 6–7% discontinued treatment due to AE, 34–44% experienced nausea, 21–32% diarrhoea and 22–25% vomiting).

For orforglipron, participants initiated on higher doses and those on rapid titration schemes appeared to have higher discontinuation rates, providing insights into the optimisation process for the phase 3 trials.

For danuglipron, most AE were mild in severity at the phase 2 trial for people with T2D, but 22–34% of participants receiving the higher doses (≥ 80 mg twice daily) discontinued the medication due to AE (vs. 8% with placebo, Table 3). As the discontinuation rates were also high with the twice daily danuglipron at the phase 2 obesity trial (as discussed above), twice daily danuglirpon formulation will not advance into phase 3 studies, but an improved once-daily formulation with an aim to improve tolerability profile is currently under assessment. Another oral, non-peptide GLP-1 RA (lotiglipron) has also been withdrawn from development as in early phase clinical trials resulted in elevated liver enzymes which could indicate liver toxicity.

Obesity is a global health challenge with few pharmacologic options. Whether adults with obesity can achieve weight loss with once-weekly semaglutide at a dose of 2.4 mg as an adjunct to lifestyle intervention has not been confirmed.

In this double-blind trial, we enrolled 1961 adults with a body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) of 30 or greater (≥ 27 in persons with ≥ 1 weight-related coexisting condition), who did not have diabetes, and randomly assigned them, in a 2:1 ratio, to 68 weeks of treatment with once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide (at a dose of 2.4 mg) or placebo, plus lifestyle intervention. The coprimary end points were the percentage change in body weight and weight reduction of at least 5%. The primary estimand (a precise description of the treatment effect reflecting the objective of the clinical trial) assessed effects regardless of treatment discontinuation or rescue interventions.

Results

The mean change in body weight from baseline to week 68 was -14.9% in the semaglutide group as compared with -2.4% with placebo, for an estimated treatment difference of -12.4 percentage points (95% confidence interval [CI] -13.4 to -11.5; P < 0.001). More participants in the semaglutide group than in the placebo group achieved weight reductions of 5% or more (1047 participants [86.4%] vs. 182 [31.5%]), 10% or more (838 [69.1%] vs. 69 [12.0%]), and 15% or more (612 [50.5%] vs. 28 [4.9%]) at week 68 (P < 0.001 for all three comparisons of odds). The change in body weight from baseline to week 68 was -15.3 kg in the semaglutide group as compared with -2.6 kg in the placebo group (estimated treatment difference, -12.7 kg; 95% CI, -13.7 to -11.7). Participants who received semaglutide had a greater improvement with respect to cardiometabolic risk factors and a greater increase in participant-reported physical functioning from baseline than those who received placebo. Nausea and diarrhea were the most common adverse events with semaglutide; they were typically transient and mild-to-moderate in severity and subsided with time. More participants in the semaglutide group than in the placebo group discontinued treatment owing to gastrointestinal events (59 [4.5%] vs. 5 [0.8%]).

Conclusions

In participants with overweight or obesity, 2.4 mg of semaglutide once weekly plus lifestyle intervention was associated with sustained, clinically relevant reduction in body weight. (Funded by Novo Nordisk; STEP 1 ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT03548935).

✱ p < 0.0001 (unadjusted 2-sided) for superiority.

For Study 5, the primary efficacy parameter was mean percent change in body weight from randomization (week 20) to week 68.

From randomization (week 20) to week 68, treatment with WEGOVY resulted in a statistically significant reduction in body weight compared with placebo (Table 7). Because patients who discontinued WEGOVY during titration and those who did not reach the 2.4 mg weekly dose were not eligible for the randomized treatment period, the results may not reflect the experience of patients in the general population who are first starting WEGOVY.

LSMean = least squares mean; CI = confidence interval

1902 patients were enrolled at week 0 with a mean baseline body weight of 106.8 kg. The intent-to-treat population includes all randomized patients. At week 68, the body weight was missing for 2.8% and 6.7% of patients randomized to WEGOVY and placebo, respectively. Missing data were imputed from retrieved subjects of the same randomized treatment arm (RD-MI).

### High-dose semaglutide (up to 16 mg) in people with type 2 diabetes and overweight or obesity: a randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial [^112RcCFN]. Diabetes Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Studies have demonstrated dose-dependent efficacy of glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists for glycemic control and body weight. The aim of this trial was to characterize the dose-dependent effects of semaglutide (up to 16 mg/week) in people with type 2 diabetes and overweight or obesity.

Research Design and Methods

In this parallel-group, participant- and investigator-blinded, phase 2 trial, 245 individuals with type 2 diabetes and BMI ≥ 27 kg/m2 on metformin were randomized to weekly semaglutide (2, 8, or 16 mg s.c.) or placebo for 40 weeks. Doses were escalated every 4 weeks, followed by a maintenance period. Dose modifications were not allowed. Primary and secondary efficacy end points included change from baseline to week 40 in HbA1c and body weight, respectively.

Results

Estimated treatment difference between 16 and 2 mg was -0.3 percentage points (%-points) (95% CI -0.7 to 0.2; P = 0.245) for HbA1c change and -3.4 kg (-6.0 to -0.8; P = 0.011) for weight change for the treatment policy estimand and -0.5%-points (-1.0 to -0.1; P = 0.015) and -4.5 kg (-7.6 to -1.4; P = 0.004), respectively, for the hypothetical estimand. Dose-response modeling confirmed these findings. Treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) and treatment discontinuations due to AEs, primarily gastrointestinal, were more frequent in the semaglutide 8 and 16 mg groups than in the 2 mg group. No severe hypoglycemic episodes were reported.

Conclusions

Higher semaglutide doses for type 2 diabetes and overweight or obesity provide modest additional glucose-lowering effect, with additional weight loss, at the expense of more AEs and treatment discontinuations. A study for evaluating high-dose semaglutide in obesity is currently underway.

### Semaglutide in obesity: unmet needs in men [^111onX3c]. Diabetes Therapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Finding the optimal dose titration scheme helps to reduce AEs, and improve tolerability and adherence. A phase 2 dose-finding study for semaglutide in which 65% of the study population were men reported that slow dose escalation of semaglutide using 4-week dose escalation steps starting from an initial dose of 0.25 mg/week ameliorated AEs without compromising efficacy. A trial that included only a male population, which had the aim to investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of single escalating doses of semaglutide, identified the maximum tolerated single dose (MTSD) to be 15 μg/kg body weight, which was worked out to be 1.2 mg in a male subject weighing 80 kg. There were no serious AEs and no subjects were withdrawn due to AEs.

Based on differences in exposure-response analysis between men and women, established MTSD and our clinical experience, we propose that a higher initial dose of semaglutide of 0.5 mg/week should be considered for men, especially those with BMI > 35 kg/m 2. In the event of good tolerability, a rapid titration scheme in general may then be used in men. Since the response on weight reduction in men seems to be delayed in comparison to that in women, we also advise to delay the efficacy assessment in men to later than 3 months after treatment initiation. It would be of specific clinical interest to design randomized controlled trails to address these issues.

### Real-world use of semaglutide for weight management: patient characteristics and dose titration – A Danish cohort study [^116JCFpq]. Diabetes Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

To determine patient characteristics and dose titration patterns of real-world semaglutide (Wegovy) users.

Research Design and Methods

We used a population-based cohort study including Danish adults who filled semaglutide prescriptions from 12 December 2022 to 31 December 2023. Outcomes were patient characteristics, prescriber type, and dose titration patterns.

Results

We identified 110,748 individuals (median age 49 years; 70% female) filling 773,708 prescriptions for semaglutide. General practitioners initiated treatment in 86%. Common comorbidities included hypertension (30%), dyslipidemia (17%), and arthrosis (17%). Only 13% reached the maximum dose of 2.4 mg by their fifth prescription, while 5.7% stopped after the first prescription. Few users (10%) followed recommended dose increases every 4 weeks. Overall, 25% filled at least one prescription of 2.4 mg, while 33–48% continued with the 1.0-mg dosage from the fourth prescription onward.

Conclusions

Real-world semaglutide users generally resembled trial participants, but few follow the dose titration schemes tested in premarket clinical trials.

Randomisation and masking

Randomisation was done centrally using an interactive web response system and stratified for presence or absence of type 2 diabetes. Calyx (formerly Parexel) generated the randomisation list. Randomisation was done in a 2:1 ratio to the semaglutide or placebo group with a block size of six; patients were assigned to the next available treatment according to a randomisation schedule. Patients, investigators, trial site staff, and the sponsor (except for specific laboratory staff and individuals responsible for safety) remained blinded to treatment assignment throughout the trial. Semaglutide and placebo injections were visually identical — ie, used the same syringes and volume of injection, etc — to preserve blinding.

Procedures

Patients assigned to the semaglutide group received once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide and those assigned to the placebo group received once-weekly, subcutaneous placebo for 48 weeks with a 7-week follow-up. Semaglutide was escalated from an initial dose of 0·24 mg to 0·5 mg after 4 weeks, and thereafter every 4 weeks to 1·0 mg, 1·7 mg, and finally 2·4 mg once weekly after 16 weeks' treatment (appendix p 4). Dietary and lifestyle advice was given as standard of care according to local standards. During dose escalation, patients could remain at their existing level for up to 1 additional week for tolerability (eg, gastrointestinal events) or other reasons, as judged by the investigator. Patients were removed from the trial if any of the following criteria were met: simultaneous participation in another clinical trial, diagnosis of acute pancreatitis or medullary thyroid carcinoma, surgical treatment for obesity, or events of hepatic decompensation (eg ascites, variceal bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy, or spontaneous bacterial peritonitis).

### Long-acting PYYanalogue with semaglutide for obesity: from preclinical assessment through randomized clinical studies [^1127yUzH]. Obesity (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

The hormone peptide YY (PYY; cleaved into Y 2 -selective form PYY 3–36) is an attractive candidate for use as a complementary pharmacotherapy for obesity along with glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists. This series of studies investigated a novel long-acting PYY 3–36 analogue (PYY1875) alone and as an add-on to semaglutide for treatment of obesity.

Methods

Weight loss and food intake were first investigated in obese male rats, followed by phase 1 and 2 clinical studies investigating efficacy, safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of PYY1875 as monotherapy and in combination with semaglutide in participants with overweight or obesity.

Results

PYY1875 induced additional body weight loss in semaglutide-treated obese rats. In the phase 1 study, all doses of PYY1875 alone and coadministered with semaglutide were tolerated. In the phase 2 study, a modest but not clinically meaningful treatment effect of PYY1875 1.0mg versus placebo as an add-on to semaglutide 2.4mg was observed. However, gastrointestinal-related adverse events were common with the 1.0-mg PYY1875 dose, and the 2.0-mg PYY1875 dose escalation regimen was not tolerated (both as add-ons to semaglutide).

Conclusions

PYY1875 showed modest efficacy as an add-on to semaglutide for weight management in people with obesity, but the treatment was not well tolerated.

3.2 Incidence, timing and severity of any type of gastrointestinal adverse event (1‐3 pooled analysis)

A greater proportion of participants reported GI AEs in the semaglutide 2.4 mg arm compared with placebo: 72.9% and 47.1%, respectively (Table S2). Most GI AEs were non‐serious (99.5% of AEs) and mild or moderate in severity (98.1%) (Table S2). Severe GI AEs (namely nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhoea and vomiting) were reported by more participants in the semaglutide 2.4 mg arm (4.1% of participants) compared with the placebo arm (0.9%) (Table S2). GI AEs were reported more frequently within the dose‐escalation period, with the cumulative incidence of participants experiencing their first GI AE plateauing after week 20 (Figure 1A). Data for the 1.0 mg dose of semaglutide (STEP 2) are shown in Table S3 and Figure S2.

### Treat to target in weight management with semaglutide: real-world evidence from an eHealth clinic [^114BoHXq]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

In the phase 3 STEP program, a set of RCTs which evaluated semaglutide 2.4 mg/week for treatment of obesity, semaglutide together with lifestyle intervention led to a mean weight loss of 15%–16% after 68 weeks in the analysis of all randomised participants irrespective of treatment discontinuation and rescue medication. This is slightly less than the 16.7% observed in the present study. Notably, 86%–90% of the participants in these studies reached 2.4 mg/week, in contrast to only 28.8% titrating to above 1 mg/week in our study. Our results are more similar to the ~17% weight loss in the STEP program estimated by a hypothetical approach analysing the effect if all participants took the drug as intended. The study populations were generally similar between our study and the STEP program regarding age and sex, but the present cohort had a lower initial BMI (34.3 kg/m 2 vs. 37.8 kg/m 2 in STEP 1). A separate RWE studywith a comparable lifestyle intervention to this study showed a mean weight loss of 19.4% after just 12 months, but without a detailed description of how much medication was used during the study. Thus, some of the high efficacy in the current study with less than half the medication is likely a result of the IBT involving cognitive behavioural therapy, acceptance and commitment therapy, and a designated health coach available through the digital app solution.

The observation of similar weight losses across semaglutide doses in our study is in contrast with prior studies, showing that higher maintenance doses, compared to lower doses, increased weight loss. This discrepancy most likely reflects the personalised medication strategy in the present study, where participants were encouraged to stay on the lowest effective dose associated with continued weight loss and a manageable satiety/hunger. Interestingly, an exploratory analysis of dose escalations after week 26 among participants with different weight loss outcomes at week 26 showed only minor overall differences, suggesting that non‐responders were not substantially more likely to escalate their dose. However, it remains unknown how outcomes might have differed under a standardised titration of semaglutide. Therefore, the observation that weight loss was similar despite medication dose reflects the implication of a personalised dosing strategy and shows that different patients may require different titration strategies for optimal weight loss and support a more personalised, treat‐to‐target strategy where dose escalation is tailored to the individual.

Semaglutide was taken as once‐weekly subcutaneous injections. Dose escalations were generally tapered to a tolerable level at the discretion of the managing healthcare professional and were continuously assessed during the programme. However, dose escalations were generally not advocated by the clinic if the patient maintained a weekly weight reduction > 0.5% of their body weight and was able to manage the experienced satiety/hunger while on the medication. If satiety and hunger were perceived as unmanageable and/or sufficient weight loss was not achieved, the dose could be escalated. Regular follow‐ups and dose adjustments were based on individual response and tolerability. A titration chart used by the treating healthcare professional can be found in the Appendix S1. In the case of adverse events, depending on the severity of the adverse event report, the participant could either be maintained at the current dose, reduced to a dose in between standard doses, reduced to the previous titration dose, or terminated until the adverse event was properly handled. In general, there was an ongoing dialogue between the participant and health coach in collaboration with the treating nurse and physician about weekly dose and treatment effects. Participants were maintained at an effective dose level until their treatment goal was reached or the patient reached a BMI of 25. At this time, if motivated for tapering of medication, the participant was provided with a personalised tapering plan designed to support a gradual lowering of medicine, with dose reductions every 4–8weeks, depending on weight fluctuations and satiety/hunger changes reported by the participant. If a significant weight increase occurred (> 2 kg) or hunger became overwhelming after a dose reduction, the dose could be adjusted upward to prevent substantial weight gain while maintaining the overall goal of gradually tapering the patient to the lowest efficient dose level of semaglutide or cessation of semaglutide.

### Safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of concomitant administration of multiple doses of cagrilintide with semaglutide 2. 4 mg for weight management: a randomised, controlled, phase 1b trial [^11776rNr]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

Background

Cagrilintide, a long-acting amylin analogue, and semaglutide 2·4 mg, a glucagon-like peptide-1 analogue, are both being investigated as options for weight management. We aimed to determine the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of this drug combination.

Methods

In this randomised, placebo-controlled, multiple-ascending dose, phase 1b trial, individuals aged 18–55 years with a body-mass index 27·0–39·9 kg/m 2 and who were otherwise healthy were recruited from a single centre in the USA. The trial included six sequential overlapping cohorts, and in each cohort eligible participants were randomly assigned (3:1) to once-weekly subcutaneous cagrilintide (0·16, 0·30, 0·60, 1·2, 2·4, or 4·5 mg) or matched placebo, in combination with once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2·4 mg, without lifestyle interventions. In each cohort, the doses of cagrilintide and semaglutide were co-escalated in 4-week intervals to the desired dose over 16 weeks, participants were treated at the target dose for 4 weeks, and then followed up for 5 weeks. Participants, investigators, and the sponsor were masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was number of treatment-emergent adverse events from baseline to end of follow-up. Secondary pharmacokinetic endpoints assessed from day of last dose (week 19) to end of treatment (week 20) were area under the plasma concentration-time curve from 0 to 168 h (AUC 0–168 h) and maximum concentration [C max] of cagrilintide and semaglutide; exploratory pharmacokinetic endpoints were half-life, time to C max [t max], plasma clearance, and volume of distribution of cagrilintide and semaglutide; and exploratory pharmacodynamic endpoints were changes in bodyweight, glycaemic parameters, and hormones. Safety, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic endpoints were assessed in all participants who were exposed to at least one dose of study drug. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03600480, and is now complete.

Findings

Between July 25, 2018, and Dec 17, 2019, 285 individuals were screened and 96 were randomly assigned to cagrilintide (0·16–2·4 mg group n = 12; 4·5 mg group n = 11) or placebo (n = 24), in combination with semaglutide 2·4 mg, of whom 95 were exposed to treatment (one patient in 0·60 mg cagrilintide group was not exposed) and included in the safety and full analysis datasets. The mean age was 40·6 years (SD 9·2), 56 (59%) of 95 participants were men and 51 (54%) were Black or African American. Of 566 adverse events reported in 92 participants (69 [97%] of 71 participants assigned to 0·16–4·5 mg cagrilintide and 23 [96%] of 24 assigned to placebo), 207 (37%) were gastrointestinal disorders. Most adverse events were mild to moderate in severity and the proportion of participants with one or more adverse event was similar across treatment groups. Exposure was proportional to cagrilintide dose and did not affect semaglutide exposure or elimination. AUC 0–168 h ranged from 926 nmol×h/L to 24271 nmol×h/L, and C max ranged from 6·14 nmol/L to 170 nmol/L with cagrilintide 0·16–4·5 mg. AUC 0–168 h ranged from 12757 nmol×h/L to 15305 nmol×h/L, and C max ranged from 96·4 nmol/L to 120 nmol/L with semaglutide 2·4 mg. Cagrilintide 0·16–4·5 mg had a half-life of 159–195 h, with a median t max of 24–72 h. Semaglutide 2·4 mg had a half-life of 145–165 h, with a median t max of 12–24 h. Plasma clearance and volume of distribution for both cagrilintide and semaglutide were similar across treatment groups. At week 20, mean percentage bodyweight reductions were greater with cagrilintide 1·2 and 2·4 mg than with placebo (15·7% [SE 1·6] for cagrilintide 1·2 mg and 17·1% [1·5] for cagrilintide 2·4 mg vs 9·8% [1·2] for pooled placebo cohorts 1–5; estimated treatment difference of -6·0% [95% CI -9·9 to -2·0] for cagrilintide 1·2 mg and -7·4% [-11·2 to -3·5] for cagrilintide 2·4 mg vs pooled placebo), and with cagrilintide 4·5 mg than with matched placebo (15·4% [1·3] vs 8·0% [2·2]; estimated treatment difference -7·4% [-12·8 to -2·1]), all in combination with semaglutide 2·4 mg. Glycaemic parameters improved in all treatment groups, independently of cagrilintide dose. Changes in hormones were similar across treatment groups.

Interpretation

Concomitant treatment with cagrilintide and semaglutide 2·4 mg was well tolerated with an acceptable safety profile. Future larger and longer trials are needed to fully assess the efficacy and safety of this treatment combination.
