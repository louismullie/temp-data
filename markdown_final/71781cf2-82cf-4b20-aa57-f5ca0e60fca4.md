## Question

What is the significance of low testosterone, estradiol, and progesterone levels in postmenopausal women?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the significance of low estradiol, progesterone, and testosterone levels in postmenopausal women — what these levels mean, how to evaluate them, and how to treat based on evidence and guidelines. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the physiological hormonal changes in postmenopause and how they differ across estradiol, progesterone, and testosterone. Then, I should verify the symptom–pathophysiology links for each hormone and the strength of evidence. Next, I will examine guideline-concordant evaluation and monitoring, including what to measure and when. After that, I need to outline therapeutic decision-making for estrogen, progestogen, and testosterone, including safety and monitoring. Finally, I will highlight uncertainties and synthesize an integrated, risk-stratified plan with a concise summary.

> Let me first confirm the core physiology. After 12 months of amenorrhea from ovarian follicle depletion, estradiol production plummets and the predominant circulating estrogen becomes estrone via peripheral aromatization of adrenal androstenedione, while gonadotropins rise from loss of ovarian feedback, which together define the postmenopausal hormonal milieu, and this shift is consistently documented in FDA labels and endocrine reviews, with estradiol far more potent at the receptor than estrone but markedly reduced in concentration postmenopause [^115SsQEC]. Wait, I should verify testosterone next. Unlike estradiol and progesterone, testosterone decline is primarily age-related rather than menopause-specific, with roughly a 50% decrease from early adulthood into the mid-40s and continuing gradual decline thereafter, reflecting mixed adrenal and ovarian sources plus peripheral conversion, which I need to keep distinct from menopause-driven hypoestrogenism during clinical reasoning.

> Now, I need to link low estradiol to clinical consequences. Low estradiol is causally tied to vasomotor symptoms and genitourinary syndrome of menopause and is a major risk factor for bone loss and fracture via increased osteoclast activity, with broad systemic effects across cardiovascular, neurologic, and metabolic domains discussed in contemporary reviews, and guidelines recommend menopausal hormone therapy for symptomatic women under 60 or within 10 years of menopause without contraindications, favoring the transdermal route in those with cardiometabolic risk due to a more favorable risk profile [^115SsQEC] [^116ub51F] [^116TwWEe]. Hold on, I should not overlook mood. Let me verify the prevention data. A randomized trial showed transdermal estradiol plus intermittent micronized progesterone prevented onset of clinically significant depressive symptoms during the menopause transition and early postmenopause, which is prevention rather than treatment, so I should be precise about that distinction when counseling patients [^114Sfg2t].

> I should double-check measurement and monitoring nuances for estradiol because assay performance at low concentrations is a common pitfall. Postmenopausal estradiol assays require ultrasensitive, standardized methods, and expert workshops emphasize establishing reference ranges with certified assays, given historical fivefold variability across methods at low levels, which could mislead clinical decision-making if not recognized [^117ED91R] [^11313nzH]. Wait, let me verify a real-world therapeutic detail. Even on licensed transdermal estradiol doses, roughly one in four women may have subtherapeutic serum estradiol levels, which supports symptom-guided titration with judicious use of levels when response is inadequate, though I need to remember that clinical benefit, not a numeric target alone, should drive dosing [^112XBzDj].

> Next, I will examine low testosterone. Let me think this through carefully. Low testosterone is not a driver of vasomotor symptoms, has no established benefit for cognition or general wellbeing, and has not shown independent benefits on bone density or body composition in physiologic dosing, which means low T is not a general explanation for nonspecific symptoms in postmenopausal women, and I should avoid attributing broad syndromes to it without a sexual health phenotype [^111WHfat]. I was about to say "the only FDA-recognized indication is HSDD", but wait, that's imprecise and I should correct it now. There is no FDA-approved testosterone product for women in the United States; rather, the only evidence-based indication supported by international consensus is treatment of hypoactive sexual desire disorder with physiologic-dose testosterone after a full biopsychosocial assessment, ideally using female-appropriate formulations where available and otherwise cautious titration of male products to female physiologic ranges with close monitoring [^115TWE1i]. Let me verify effect size. Meta-analyses show a modest benefit, about one additional satisfying sexual event per month along with improvements in desire and arousal, which I should frame as moderate and variable in response [^111gK2zf] [^115CuyDv].

> Hold on, I should review safety and measurement before drawing conclusions. Systemic testosterone at female-physiologic doses is associated with mild increases in acne and hirsutism, with oral formulations worsening lipids and thus not recommended, and although short-term trials have not shown major cardiometabolic harms in lower-risk samples, long-term safety remains uncertain, which means shared decision-making and time-limited therapeutic trials with discontinuation for nonresponse are prudent [^1151dCLj] [^115TWE1i]. I need to ensure assays are appropriate. Direct free testosterone assays are unreliable in the female range, so I should preferentially use liquid or gas chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry for total testosterone and monitor to avoid supraphysiologic exposure, and I should not use total testosterone levels to diagnose HSDD itself, only to guide safe dosing and rule out excess [^114kXfbP] [^115TWE1i]. Let me reconsider adjuncts. Systemic DHEA has not shown meaningful improvement for libido in women with normal adrenal function and is not recommended for HSDD, which helps avoid therapies with weak evidence [^117GX1vK].

> I will now examine low progesterone. Progesterone's essential clinical role postmenopause is endometrial protection when systemic estrogen is prescribed to a woman with an intact uterus, and this is a consistent tenet of endocrine guidelines that I should confirm before writing any estrogen prescription [^116ub51F]. Wait, I should verify any extra-systemic effects. There is evidence that progesterone adds to estrogen for skeletal benefits, with data showing superior lumbar spine BMD gains for estrogen plus progesterone compared with estrogen alone, supporting a bone-protective synergy even if progesterone's isolated effects are less distinct in the postmenopausal state, and emerging neurosteroid considerations via allopregnanolone may partially intersect with mood physiology, though measurement at low concentrations is technically challenging in routine care [^1121XEUe]. But wait, I should be cautious. Observational links between low estradiol and progesterone states and suicide attempt severity exist, yet these are hypothesis-generating and not sufficient to recommend progesterone solely for mood, so I should not overinterpret correlational data when advising patients [^116jv6vA].

> Let me synthesize the hormone interplay before moving to evaluation. The natural postmenopausal state is combined low estradiol and low progesterone, producing a cluster of vasomotor, genitourinary, sleep, and sometimes mood or cognitive complaints, with estradiol deficiency as the dominant driver of systemic symptoms and long-term skeletal risk, progesterone needed for uterine protection if estrogen is used, and testosterone primarily influencing sexual desire with narrow, evidence-based indications, a differentiation that helps avoid overtesting and overtreatment while addressing the principal pathophysiology [^115SsQEC] [^1121XEUe]. Hold on, I should verify the "endometrial safety paradox". With naturally low estradiol, absolute endometrial risk is low, but once systemic estrogen therapy is initiated in a uterus-intact patient, progestogen becomes mandatory to mitigate unopposed estrogen effects, which is why regimen selection must consider uterine status up front [^116ub51F].

> Next, I should review a practical evaluation framework. First, confirm menopausal status clinically by 12 months of amenorrhea, supported as needed by elevated FSH in the appropriate context, while remembering that routine hormone measurements are not required to diagnose natural menopause, which prevents unnecessary testing and misinterpretation of fluctuating values during the transition [^115SsQEC] [^113xW3KT]. I need to check how to align testing with symptoms. Measure estradiol primarily for therapy monitoring when clinical response is unclear or suboptimal, interpret results with awareness of assay limitations at low concentrations, and consider testosterone measurement by mass spectrometry when evaluating distressing low desire and contemplating a monitored therapeutic trial, while generally avoiding routine progesterone testing postmenopause due to low utility and assay insensitivity at very low levels [^117ED91R] [^114kXfbP] [^11313nzH]. I should confirm risk stratification. Assess cardiovascular and breast cancer risk, because these shape hormone therapy route and eligibility, with a preference for transdermal estradiol in those with moderate cardiometabolic risk and explicit consideration of baseline breast cancer risk in therapy selection [^116TwWEe] [^1174zrG3].

> I will now outline treatment choices with built-in self-checks. For bothersome vasomotor symptoms in eligible women under 60 or within 10 years of menopause, use systemic estrogen therapy as first-line, adding a progestogen if the uterus is intact, and prefer the transdermal route when cardiometabolic risk is present, while titrating based on symptoms and, when needed, levels, mindful that a meaningful minority on standard transdermal dosing may have low serum estradiol and may require adjustment for adequate control [^116ub51F] [^116TwWEe] [^112XBzDj]. Hold on, let me verify testosterone specifics. Reserve systemic testosterone for carefully diagnosed HSDD after addressing biopsychosocial contributors, aim for premenopausal physiologic concentrations using the lowest effective dose, reassess at 3 to 6 months, and discontinue by 6 months if no meaningful benefit, documenting mild androgenic side effects and avoiding oral formulations due to adverse lipid effects, with ongoing monitoring to prevent supraphysiologic exposure [^115TWE1i] [^1151dCLj]. If systemic hormone therapy is contraindicated or breast cancer risk is intermediate to high, prioritize nonhormonal options for vasomotor symptoms, and employ shared decision-making regarding duration, tapering, and annual reassessment of risks and goals for any ongoing hormone therapy, which avoids inertia and aligns care with evolving risk profiles [^1112NDzW] [^112qfBPr] [^1169oVcS].

> But wait, what uncertainties should I flag explicitly. The cardiovascular "timing hypothesis" and the net effects of sex steroids in different cardiometabolic phenotypes remain debated, long-term safety data for female testosterone therapy are limited, and differences between micronized progesterone and synthetic progestins for breast risk need ongoing clarification, which means I should counsel with humility about benefit–risk estimates and update as evidence evolves [^115SsQEC] [^115TWE1i]. I should also double-check measurement frontiers. Persistent assay variability at low estradiol concentrations and lack of harmonized testosterone assays in the female range still complicate care and research, underscoring the need for standardized, ultrasensitive platforms, while genetic and intracrine variability likely contribute to heterogeneous responses yet are not clinically actionable today, which I should acknowledge when expectations are set with patients [^117ED91R] [^114kXfbP]. Finally, I need to remember special populations. Women with premature or early menopause have higher absolute risks for bone and cardiovascular outcomes, and estrogen replacement to the age of natural menopause is generally recommended barring contraindications, with careful attention to sexual health concerns that may persist despite estrogen repletion [^111n8wfL].

> In summary, low estradiol is the principal driver of postmenopausal symptoms and skeletal risk, treated effectively with systemic estrogen in appropriately selected women, adding a progestogen for uterine protection, while testosterone has a focused role only for well-diagnosed HSDD with modest benefits and uncertain long-term safety, and progesterone's independent role is limited but synergistic for endometrial and possibly skeletal outcomes during estrogen therapy, all within a framework of route selection, individualized risk stratification, judicious measurement, and periodic reassessment to ensure benefit exceeds risk over time [^115SsQEC] [^116ub51F] [^115TWE1i] [^1121XEUe].

Low testosterone, estradiol, and progesterone in postmenopausal women reflect **normal ovarian aging** [^112hXdgh] and are not inherently pathological [^113xW3KT] [^115kuLDK]. These low levels underlie common menopausal symptoms (vasomotor, sexual, mood, cognitive, musculoskeletal, and genitourinary) [^115SsQEC] and **increase risks of osteoporosis, cardiovascular disease, and metabolic syndrome** [^1121XEUe] [^115SsQEC]. Management is symptom-driven: hormone therapy is considered for vasomotor and bone protection [^116ub51F], with testosterone reserved for hypoactive sexual desire disorder after careful assessment [^115TWE1i] [^111gK2zf]; non-hormonal options are used when hormones are contraindicated [^1112NDzW] [^115SsQEC]. Persistent or severe symptoms despite therapy warrant evaluation for other endocrine or systemic causes [^1161RVZR].

## Physiological basis of low hormone levels in postmenopausal women

### Estradiol

Ovarian decline: After menopause [^112hXdgh], ovarian estradiol production ceases; peripheral conversion of adrenal androgens to estrone becomes the main estrogen source [^115kuLDK], with estradiol much lower than in reproductive years. Feedback effects: Low estradiol reduces negative feedback [^112hXdgh], raising LH and FSH, contributing to menopausal symptoms.

---

### Progesterone

Luteal absence: Progesterone falls sharply after menopause because ovulation and the corpus luteum cease [^116RYczs]; only minimal adrenal/ovarian production remains.

---

### Testosterone

Age-related decline: Testosterone declines gradually with age [^113xW3KT] due to reduced ovarian and adrenal secretion, independent of menopause [^114kXfbP]. Peripheral conversion: About half of circulating testosterone derives from peripheral conversion [^113xW3KT] of androgen precursors (androstenedione, DHEA, DHEAS).

---

## Clinical implications of low hormone levels

### Vasomotor symptoms

Hot flashes: Low estradiol drives hot flashes [^115SsQEC] and night sweats, affecting quality of life [^113db1pe].

---

### Sexual dysfunction

Libido and arousal: Low estradiol and testosterone contribute to decreased libido, arousal, and vaginal dryness [^115SsQEC] [^115TWE1i]. HSDD: Low testosterone is linked to hypoactive sexual desire disorder in some women.

---

### Mood and cognitive changes

Mood/cognition: Low estradiol and progesterone are associated with mood disturbances, anxiety, depression, and cognitive complaints [^115SsQEC] [^114Sfg2t].

---

### Musculoskeletal health

Bone loss: Low estradiol and progesterone increase bone resorption [^1121XEUe] and fracture risk [^115SsQEC]. Muscle mass: Low testosterone may reduce muscle mass and strength [^115SsQEC] [^117HaYHq].

---

### Cardiovascular and metabolic health

CVD risk: Low estradiol is linked to adverse lipid profiles and higher cardiovascular risk [^115SsQEC] [^116A6UXL]. Metabolic syndrome: Low testosterone may contribute to insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome [^115SsQEC].

---

## Clinical significance and management strategies

### Hormone replacement therapy (HRT)

Indications: HRT is effective for vasomotor symptoms [^116ub51F], osteoporosis prevention, and some mood/cognitive symptoms [^115SsQEC]. Risks: HRT carries risks (breast cancer, cardiovascular events) and requires individualized risk–benefit assessment [^1174zrG3] [^115SsQEC].

---

### Testosterone therapy

HSDD only: Testosterone is indicated only for HSDD [^115TWE1i] after thorough assessment [^111gK2zf]. Monitoring: Regular monitoring is essential [^114kXfbP] to avoid supraphysiological levels and adverse effects [^1151dCLj] [^111gK2zf].

---

### Non-hormonal therapies

Alternatives: Non-hormonal options (SSRIs, SNRIs, gabapentin, lifestyle changes) are used when hormones are contraindicated or not tolerated [^1112NDzW] [^115SsQEC].

---

## When to investigate further

Atypical features: Persistent or severe symptoms despite therapy, or atypical features (e.g. rapid bone loss, severe mood changes, unusual sexual dysfunction), warrant evaluation for other endocrine or systemic disorders (e.g. thyroid disease, adrenal insufficiency, pituitary disorders) [^1161RVZR].

---

Low testosterone, estradiol, and progesterone in postmenopausal women **are expected after menopause** [^112hXdgh] and drive many menopausal symptoms and health risks. Management is individualized, balancing hormone and non-hormone options, with further evaluation if symptoms are atypical or refractory [^116ub51F].

### The menopause transition: Signs, symptoms, and management options [^113db1pe]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Low credibility.

Menopause, the permanent cessation of menses, reflects oocyte depletion and the loss of gonadal steroids. It is preceded by a transitional state, the perimenopause, which is characterized by the gradual loss of oocytes, altered responsiveness to gonadal steroid feedback, wide hormonal fluctuations, and irregular menstrual patterns. The goal of this mini-review is to discuss the basic pathophysiology of the menopausal transition and the hormonal and non-hormonal management options for clinicopathology attributed to it.

- **Evidence acquisition**: A Medline search of epidemiologic, population-based studies, and studies of reproductive physiology was conducted. A total of 758 publications were screened.

- **Evidence synthesis**: The reproductive hormonal milieu of the menopausal transition precipitates bothersome vasomotor symptoms, mood disruption, temporary cognitive dysfunction, genitourinary symptoms, and other disease processes that reduce the quality of life of affected women. The endocrine tumult of the menopause transition also exposes racial and socioeconomic disparities in the onset, severity, and frequency of symptoms. Hormone therapy (HT) treatment can be effective for perimenopausal symptoms, but its use has been stymied by concerns about health risks observed in postmenopausal HT users who are older than 60 and/or women who have been postmenopausal for more than 10 years.

- **Conclusions**: The menopause transition is a disruptive process that can last for over a decade and causes symptoms in a majority of women. It is important for clinicians to recognize early signs and symptoms.

### Approach to investigation of hyperandrogenism in a postmenopausal woman [^113xW3KT]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Low credibility.

Menopausal transition is associated with a decrease in the number of antral follicles and ovarian volume, as well as a decline in serum antimüllerian hormone (AMH) as a marker for antral follicle count and ovarian reserve. When the number of antral follicles and ovarian granulosa cells decrease, estradiol levels decline and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels increase. Menopause, the last spontaneous menstruation, occurs on average at age 51 years when circulating estradiol has decreased to a level insufficient to stimulate the endometrium to grow and then shed. During this period, menopausal symptoms, including hot flushes, sweating, and sleep problems, are common and associated with the gradual decline in estradiol.

In contrast to the decrease in estradiol, circulating levels of testosterone decline as a consequence of age-related, but not menopause-related, reductions in secretion by both the adrenal gland and the ovary. This means a 50% reduction in testosterone in women aged 40–45 compared with women in the 18–24 age group. In premenopausal women, about 50% of circulating testosterone arises from direct secretion from the ovary and the adrenal gland, in equal amounts, under pituitary control of luteinizing hormone (LH) and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), respectively. The remaining 50% of testosterone is produced from peripheral conversion by ovarian and adrenal inactive androgen precursors (A4, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), and DHEAS). Testosterone is further converted in target tissues to dihydrotestosterone.

### Global consensus position statement on the use of testosterone therapy for women [^111gK2zf]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Low credibility.

- **Recommendations pertaining to the associations between endogenous androgen concentrations and female sexual function**: The associations between endogenous androgen concentrations and sexual function in women remain uncertain because of issues relating to the sensitivity and specificity of androgen assays in some studies and insufficient data. The physiology of androgens is complex because of their conversion in tissues and possible intracrine metabolism in multiple tissues. No cutoff blood level can be used for any measured circulating androgen to differentiate women with and without sexual dysfunction (Grade C).

- **Recommendations regarding systemic testosterone therapy for postmenopausal women**: Testosterone should be used in doses that approximate physiological testosterone concentrations for premenopausal women, based on findings from meta-analyses of placebo/comparator-controlled RCTs. There are insufficient data to make any recommendations regarding the use of testosterone in premenopausal women for treatment of sexual function or any other outcome.

- **Recommendations regarding testosterone treatment of naturally or surgically postmenopausal women with HSDD, with/or without concomitant estrogen therapy**: Testosterone therapy, in doses that approximate physiological testosterone concentrations for premenopausal women, exerts a beneficial effect on sexual function, including increases above the effects of placebo/comparator therapy. This includes an average of one satisfying sexual event per month and increases in the subdomains of sexual desire, arousal, and orgasm.

### Estrogen deficiency in the menopause and the role of hormone therapy: Integrating the findings of basic science research with clinical trials [^115SsQEC]. Menopause (2024). High credibility.

Menopause, defined by the cessation of menstrual cycles after 12 months of amenorrhea not due to other causes, is associated with significant hormonal changes, primarily a decrease in estrogen, androgen, and progesterone levels. This review delves into the effects of estrogen deficiency during the perimenopausal transition and postmenopause, integrating the findings of basic science with clinical trials. Here, we first outline the variation in endogenous estrogens before and after menopause, exploring both genomic and nongenomic actions of estrogen and its estrogen receptors throughout the body.

Next, we detail the spectrum of menopausal symptoms, from acute vasomotor, urogenital, and psychological issues during perimenopause to chronic reproductive, cardiovascular, neurological, skeletal, dermatologic, immune, and digestive changes postmenopause. Finally, we evaluate the role of hormone therapy in alleviating these symptoms, weighing its benefits against known risks. Publicizing these findings and providing an accurate representation of the risks and benefits of estrogen replacement to our aging patients is fundamental to improving their care, quality, and even quantity of life.

### Estrace [^112hXdgh]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Clinical pharmacology details the significant role of endogenous estrogens in the development and maintenance of the female reproductive system and secondary sexual characteristics. Although circulating estrogens exist in a dynamic equilibrium of metabolic interconversions, estradiol is the principal intracellular human estrogen and is substantially more potent than its metabolites, estrone and estriol, at the receptor level.

The primary source of estrogen in normally cycling adult women is the ovarian follicle, which secretes 70 to 500 mcg of estradiol daily, depending on the phase of the menstrual cycle. After menopause, most endogenous estrogen is produced by conversion of androstenedione, secreted by the adrenal cortex, to estrone by peripheral tissues. Thus, estrone and the sulfate conjugated form, estrone sulfate, are the most abundant circulating estrogens in postmenopausal women.

Estrogens act through binding to nuclear receptors in estrogen-responsive tissues. At the time of writing, two estrogen receptors have been identified. These vary in proportion from tissue to tissue.

Circulating estrogens modulate the pituitary secretion of the gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), through a negative feedback mechanism. Estrogens act to reduce the elevated levels of these hormones seen in postmenopausal women.

### Suicide attempts among women during low estradiol/low progesterone states [^116jv6vA]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2010). Low credibility.

The relationship between the menstrual cycle and the risk for suicidal behaviors is not clear. The aim of this study is to determine whether perimenstrual phases in fertile women are associated with acute risk for suicide attempts and explore whether risk is elevated during low estradiol/low progesterone states. Women (N = 431) recruited within 24 hours of a suicide attempt were assessed for psychopathology, suicidal behavior, and LH, FSH, estradiol, and progesterone blood levels. Among fertile women (N = 281/431), suicide attempts were more likely to occur during menses (26%, 72/281 observed vs. 15%, 43/281 expected attempts; p < 0.001). Compared to women whose attempts occurred during other phases, women who attempted suicide during low estradiol/low progesterone states (menstrual phase, amenorrhea, and menopause) reported severe suicide intent, a measure that may be predictive of eventual suicide death. Suicide attempts among women are more likely when estrogen and progesterone levels are low, and attempts made under these conditions are associated with greater severity. Low gonadal hormone levels may constitute a key factor in the neurobiological basis of suicidal behavior among women, suggesting a novel, testable hypothesis regarding the underpinnings of suicidal acts.

### Brain imaging reveals that engagement of descending inhibitory pain pathways in healthy women in a low endogenous estradiol state varies with testosterone [^114cWZD3]. Pain (2013). Low credibility.

The combined oral contraceptive pill (COCP) has been implicated in the development of a number of chronic pain conditions. Modern COCP formulations create a low endogenous estradiol, low progesterone environment similar to the early follicular phase of the natural menstrual cycle, with a variable effect on serum androgen levels. We used behavioral measures and functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the response to experimental thermal stimuli in healthy women, in both a natural and COCP-induced low endogenous estradiol state, to explore whether alterations in central pain processing may underlie these observations in COCP users. Although COCP users overall did not require lower temperatures to obtain a fixed pain intensity, alterations in the brain response to these stimuli were observed.

In a subgroup of COCP users with significantly reduced serum testosterone, however, lower temperatures were required. Region-of-interest analysis revealed that within key regions of the descending pain inhibitory system, activity in response to noxious stimulation varied with serum testosterone levels in both groups of women. Of particular interest, in COCP users, activity in the rostral ventromedial medulla increased with increasing testosterone and in those women with low testosterone, was significantly reduced compared to controls. These findings suggest that, in a low endogenous estradiol state, testosterone may be a key factor in modulating pain sensitivity via descending pathways, specifically, failure to engage descending inhibition at the level of the rostral ventromedial medulla.

### The role of testosterone therapy in postmenopausal women: Position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^1129onmS]. Menopause (2005). Low credibility.

To create an evidence-based position statement regarding the role of exogenous testosterone in postmenopausal women, the North American Menopause Society (NAMS) enlisted a panel of clinicians and researchers acknowledged as experts in the field of testosterone therapy. The panel was tasked with reviewing evidence from the medical literature, compiling supporting statements and conclusions, and reaching consensus on recommendations. The document was reviewed and approved by the NAMS Board of Trustees.

Endogenous testosterone levels have not been clearly linked to sexual function in postmenopausal women. Published evidence from randomized controlled trials, although limited, indicates that exogenous testosterone — both oral and nonoral formulations — has a positive effect on sexual function, primarily desire, arousal, and orgasmic response, in women after spontaneous or surgically induced menopause. Data are inadequate to support the use of testosterone for any other indication, including preserving or increasing bone mineral density, reducing hot flashes, increasing lean body mass, or improving well-being. Hirsutism and acne have been associated with testosterone therapy, but the actual risks are not well defined. It is not known whether testosterone therapy increases the risk of breast cancer, cardiovascular disease, or thromboembolic events. There are few data regarding the safety and efficacy of testosterone therapy in women not using concomitant estrogen therapy or for its use beyond six months.

### Treatment of symptoms of the menopause: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^116ub51F]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of menopause, particularly in addressing vasomotor symptoms, the ES 2015 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of estrogen therapy for women who have undergone a hysterectomy, or estrogen plus progestogen therapy for those without a hysterectomy. This advice is intended for menopausal patients under the age of 60 or within 10 years past menopause who experience bothersome vasomotor symptoms, with or without additional climacteric symptoms. Candidates should not have contraindications or excess cardiovascular or breast cancer risks and should be willing to undergo menopausal hormone therapy.

### Cholesterol-lowering medication, cholesterol level, and reproductive hormones in women: The Women's Ischemia Syndrome Evaluation (WISE) [^1156K7sK]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Reproductive hormones such as estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone are synthesized from a common cholesterol precursor pathway. We hypothesized that the use of statins and the resultant lower blood lipoprotein levels would be associated with lower reproductive hormone levels in women. We also sought to evaluate this association, independent of statin use, particularly among premenopausal women of childbearing age.

- **Methods**: We enrolled 453 women (114 pre-, 30 peri-, and 309 postmenopausal) with coronary risk factors (mean [± SD] age, 58 ± 13 years) who were undergoing coronary angiography for suspected ischemia at four academic medical centers. Blood lipoprotein levels (total cholesterol, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein [LDL] cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol) and serum reproductive hormone levels (estradiol, bioavailable estradiol, estrone, progesterone) were measured.

- **Results**: Use of statins was associated with lower lipoprotein levels, but not lower reproductive hormone levels, in all women. Mean estradiol levels were not significantly lower among premenopausal women with very low LDL cholesterol levels compared with women with higher LDL cholesterol levels (estradiol: 71 ± 52 pg/mL vs. 88 ± 67 pg/mL, P = 0.32).

- **Conclusion**: Among women undergoing coronary angiography for suspected myocardial ischemia, the use of statins, or lower cholesterol levels, are not associated with significantly lower levels of reproductive hormones.

### Treatment of symptoms of the menopause: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^1112NDzW]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for menopause, more specifically with respect to considerations for hormone therapy, the ES 2015 guidelines recommend considering non-hormonal therapies over hormone therapy as the first-line treatment for vasomotor symptoms in patients at high or intermediate risk of breast cancer.

### Global consensus position statement on the use of testosterone therapy for women [^1151dCLj]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Low credibility.

- **Recommendations regarding possible androgenic side effects of testosterone therapy**: Systemic testosterone therapy for postmenopausal women, in doses that approximate physiological testosterone concentrations for premenopausal women, is associated with mild increases in acne and body/facial hair growth in some women, but not with alopecia, clitoromegaly, or voice change (Level I, Grade A).

- **Recommendations regarding testosterone therapy and cardiovascular health**: Oral testosterone therapy is associated with adverse lipid profiles with negative effects on high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels and is not recommended (Level I, Grade A). Studies of nonoral testosterone therapies (percutaneous and injectable), in doses that approximate physiological testosterone concentrations for premenopausal women, have shown no statistically significant adverse effects on lipid profiles over the short term (Level I, Grade A). Testosterone therapy has not been associated with increases in blood pressure, blood glucose, or HbA1c levels (Level I, Grade A). A nonsignificant trend for an increased risk of deep venous thrombosis has been seen with testosterone therapy; however, the role of estrogen therapy in possible venous thrombosis risk cannot be excluded (Level I, Grade A). Limited data preclude assessment of the effects of testosterone therapy on myocardial infarction or death (Insufficient data). RCTs of testosterone therapy have excluded women at high cardiometabolic disease risk; most have included women taking estrogen therapy.

### Metabolic characterization of menopause: cross-sectional and longitudinal evidence [^116A6UXL]. BMC Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Menopause is associated with a decrease in estradiol, beginning during the transition phase (approximately two years before a woman's final menstrual period), with levels plateauing at a low value by approximately two years post-menopause. This decrease in estradiol is mirrored by an increase in follicle stimulating hormone levels over the same period. The metabolic changes observed here may, therefore, reflect sex and gonadotropin hormonal changes relating to the menopausal transition.

Previous studies have shown that exogenous estrogen alone, or in combination with progestogens [as hormone replacement therapy (HRT) or combined hormonal contraception], is associated with a variation in lipid levels. Of relevance to our findings, post-menopausal women using HRT were found to have lower LDL cholesterol compared to those not using HRT. However, these associations with exogenous hormones may not be causal, and it remains unclear to what extent HRT is associated with levels of non-lipid biomarkers, such as fatty acids and amino acids.

Several studies have recently found both exogenous hormones and reproductive-status changes, including pregnancy and menopause (as studied here), to be associated with changes in a wide range of circulating metabolites. Further research to understand the relationship between circulating levels of reproductive hormones at different stages of the life course and changes in comprehensive metabolic profiles would be important. This would provide a better understanding of the extent to which sex hormones influence metabolism during different reproductive stages of life.

The menopause transition and early postmenopausal period are associated with a 2- to 4-fold increased risk for clinically significant depressive symptoms. Although a few studies suggest that hormone therapy can effectively manage existing depression during this time, to our knowledge, there have been no studies testing whether hormone therapy can prevent the onset of perimenopausal and early postmenopausal depressive symptoms.

- **Objective**: To examine the efficacy of transdermal estradiol plus intermittent micronized progesterone (TE+IMP) in preventing depressive symptom onset among initially euthymic perimenopausal and early postmenopausal women. A secondary aim was to identify baseline characteristics predicting TE+IMP's beneficial mood effects.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: Double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial conducted at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill from October 2010 to February 2016. Participants included euthymic perimenopausal and early postmenopausal women from the community, aged 45 to 60 years.

- **Interventions**: Transdermal estradiol (0.1 mg/d) or transdermal placebo for 12 months. Oral micronized progesterone (200 mg/d for 12 days) was also given every 3 months to women receiving active TE, and identical placebo pills were given to women receiving placebo.

- **Main outcome measures**: Scores on the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D), assessed at baseline and at months 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 after randomization, and the incidence of clinically significant depressive symptoms, defined as a CES-D score.

### Treatment of symptoms of the menopause: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^112qfBPr]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of menopause, particularly in relation to hormone therapy, the Endocrine Society 2015 guidelines recommend using a shared decision-making approach when patients are preparing to discontinue menopausal hormone therapy. This involves eliciting individual preferences about adopting a gradual taper versus abrupt discontinuation.

### The range and variation in serum estradiol concentration in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women treated with transdermal estradiol in a real-world setting: a cross-sectional study [^112XBzDj]. Menopause (2025). Low credibility.

Estradiol concentration: low and high levels

Low (subtherapeutic) estradiol levels were clinically defined as < 200 pmol/L. In the whole cohort (N = 1,508), 378 women (25.07%) had low levels. Two hundred ninety-six of 933 women (31.73%) using licensed doses (1–4 PE) had estradiol levels of < 200 pmol/L, including 116 of 467 women (24.84%) using the highest licensed dose (4 PE), compared with 82 of 562 women (14.59%) using off-label doses.

- **Figure 3**: The percentage of women with low estradiol levels (< 200 pmol/L) in each dose category. Dose (number of pump equivalents, PE) was treated as a categorical variable. The number of women with low or subtherapeutic levels (< 200 pmol/L) decreases as the dose increases. However, up to 1 in 4 women using the maximum licensed dose (4 PE) have low levels, and around 1 in 6 women using high off-label doses (5–8 PE) have low levels.

### Effects of aromatase inhibition in elderly men with low or borderline-low serum testosterone levels [^116urwLV]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2004). Low credibility.

As men age, serum testosterone levels decrease, which may contribute to some aspects of age-related physiological deterioration. Although androgen replacement has been shown to have beneficial effects in men with frank hypogonadism, its use in elderly men with borderline hypogonadism is controversial. Furthermore, testosterone replacement methods have important limitations. We investigated the ability of the orally administered aromatase inhibitor, anastrozole, to increase endogenous testosterone production in 37 elderly men (aged 62–74 years) with screening serum testosterone levels less than 350 ng/dl.

Subjects were randomized in a double-blind fashion to the following 12-week oral regimens:

- **Anastrozole 1 mg daily (Group 1)**: n = 12
- **Anastrozole 1 mg twice weekly (Group 2)**: n = 11
- **Placebo daily (Group 3)**: n = 14

Hormone levels, quality of life (MOS Short-Form Health Survey), sexual function (International Index of Erectile Function), benign prostate hyperplasia severity (American Urological Association Symptom Index Score), prostate-specific antigen, and measures of safety were compared among groups.

Mean ± SD bioavailable testosterone increased from 99 ± 31 to 207 ± 65 ng/dl in Group 1 and from 115 ± 37 to 178 ± 55 ng/dl in Group 2 (P < 0.001 vs. placebo for both groups and P = 0.054 Group 1 vs. Group 2). Total testosterone levels increased from 343 ± 61 to 572 ± 139 ng/dl in Group 1 and from 397 ± 106 to 520 ± 91 ng/dl in Group 2 (P < 0.001 vs. placebo for both groups and P = 0.012 Group 1 vs. Group 2). Serum estradiol levels decreased from…

### International society for the study of women's sexual health clinical practice guideline for the use of systemic testosterone for hypoactive sexual desire disorder in women [^111hdRhD]. Journal of Women's Health (2021). Low credibility.

Menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) is strongly recommended for women with early menopause, at least until the age of natural menopause, for relieving symptoms and preventing long-term medical conditions. Physiological replacement of estrogen (and progesterone if the uterus is intact) is essential for health and quality of life. The controversies surrounding the use of MHT concerning benefits and risks should not apply to the premature and early menopause population.

Although there is evidence supporting the use of estrogens with adequate endometrial protection with progestogens (when the uterus is present) in women with premature and early menopause, there is a lack of evidence supporting the use of MHT for the management of sexual dysfunction in this population. The guiding principles are to avoid decreasing testosterone by using transdermal estradiol rather than oral estrogens, because transdermal preparations exert minimal effects on SHBG and free testosterone levels and modest improvement in sexual function of early postmenopausal women.

Another approach to maintaining testosterone levels is the use of a bioidentical (biologically identical to the hormones produced in vivo) estradiol-containing contraceptive pill (estradiol valerate and dienogest, estradiol and nomegestrol acetate) in late reproductive age women requiring contraception, taking into account the androgenicity of some synthetic progestogens. The Fourth International Consultation of Sexual Medicine recommended conducting studies of testosterone therapy for women with…

### Testosterone therapy in women: A clinical challenge [^113GdaWk]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Low credibility.

The physiology of testosterone as a normal female hormone during the reproductive years and beyond is poorly taught and understood. This lack of understanding has led to unregulated and potentially dangerous prescribing practices by physicians and other healthcare professionals. There are data supporting safe use, and as women's healthcare practitioners, it is incumbent upon us to adhere to these guidelines and practices. Additionally, we must advocate for more research and the development of safer, regulated products for prescription.

### Clinical review: The benefits and harms of systemic testosterone therapy in postmenopausal women with normal adrenal function: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115CuyDv]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Use of testosterone (T) has been suggested to improve women's health during the postmenopausal period. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials to summarize the best available evidence regarding the benefits and harms of systemic T in postmenopausal women with normal adrenal function.

A comprehensive search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycInfo, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, EBSCO CINAHL, and Scopus was conducted through January 2014. Study selection, data extraction, and appraisal were conducted in duplicate. Random-effects meta-analysis was used to pool results.

We identified 35 randomized trials (n = 5053) at a moderate risk of bias. T use was associated with statistically significant improvement in various domains of sexual function and personal distress in postmenopausal women, although the majority of the trials did not have specific or contemporary diagnostic criteria for androgen deficiency in women. T use was also associated with a reduction in total cholesterol, triglyceride, and high-density lipoprotein, and an increase in low-density lipoprotein and in the incidence of acne and hirsutism. No significant effect was noted on anthropometric measures and bone density. Long-term safety data were sparse, and the quality of such evidence was low.

Despite the improvement in sexual function associated with T use in postmenopausal women, long-term safety data are lacking.

### High level of plasma estradiol as a new predictor of ischemic arterial disease in older postmenopausal women: The three-city cohort study [^114nZXZq]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2012). Low credibility.

Data on the role of testosterone in cardiovascular disease are scarce and remain conflicting. One study has found that low levels of total testosterone were an independent risk factor for CHD among postmenopausal women. In addition, other data showed that low levels of testosterone could predict both all-cause and cardiovascular death among older women.

By contrast, the Women's Health Study reported that a high free androgen index was related to an increased risk of ischemic arterial disease in postmenopausal women without HT, but this association was not independent of traditional cardiovascular risk factors. More recently, the Cardiovascular Health Study reported an association of high testosterone levels with the risk of CHD among older postmenopausal women. In addition, the same investigation showed that testosterone was positively associated with some cardiovascular risk factors, such as insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome. This latest result was concordant with an earlier study that found a positive and significant association of free testosterone with the degree of coronary artery disease among postmenopausal women.

In our study, neither age-adjusted nor fully adjusted analyses displayed an association between testosterone and the risk of ischemic arterial disease in older women. We cannot exclude the possibility that the inconsistency in previous findings and absence of association in our study could be due to heterogeneity in vascular disease outcomes, population characteristics (e.g. age, health status), and hormone measurements between studies.

### Treatment of symptoms of the menopause: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^116TwWEe]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for menopause, specifically concerning the management of cardiovascular risks, the ES 2015 guidelines recommend considering transdermal estradiol as first-line therapy for patients at moderate risk of CVD. These preparations have a less adverse effect on blood pressure, triglycerides, and carbohydrate metabolism. Offer transdermal estradiol alone to patients without a uterus. For patients with an intact uterus, combine this agent with micronized progesterone or another progestogen that does not adversely modify metabolic parameters.

### International Society for the Study of Women's Sexual Health clinical practice guideline for the use of systemic testosterone for hypoactive sexual desire disorder in women [^114e6NH5]. Journal of Women's Health (2021). Low credibility.

Testosterone values and treatment targets are complex due to variations in measurement methods with different reference standards, making it challenging to establish a universal reference range for premenopausal women. Historically, the adequacy of serum testosterone therapy, targeting premenopausal values, was assessed using the free androgen index (FAI). This involved morning total testosterone (T) and SHBG assessments. Values were computed using the equation FAI = 100 × [Total T (ng/dL)]/SHBG (nmol/L), approximating free or bioavailable testosterone. However, this method has limitations as it presumes a predictable binding of testosterone to SHBG at all concentrations.

In an attempt to define a discriminatory level correlated with sexual function and dysfunction, Guay et al. (2004) conducted a study involving 60 healthy, menstruating women aged 20–49 years, without sexual dysfunction, as determined by a validated questionnaire and detailed interview. They performed RIA measurements of morning testosterone, SHBG, and various other androgens, calculating the FAI. This small cohort study proposed a clinically useful range for the normal androgen profile in women without sexual dysfunction.

Nonetheless, the clinical applicability of this method today is limited due to several factors:

- **Small sample sizes**: The original publications had small sample sizes.
- **Measurement limitations**: RIA testosterone measurements lack sufficient accuracy and precision.

The limited applicability of the method underlines the need for more robust alternatives in current clinical practice.

### How should postmenopausal androgen excess be evaluated [^115Q1bxv]. Clinical Endocrinology (2011). Low credibility.

Evidence of clinical and/or biochemical androgen excess connotes a unique differential diagnosis in postmenopausal women. Providers need to be able to discriminate between changes of the normal aging process compared to potential pathology in older women. The evaluation and treatment of postmenopausal hirsutism and hyperandrogenism is reviewed. Androgen excess may have long-term negative health consequences and as such should be detected and treated.

### Delestrogen [^115kuLDK]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Endogenous estrogens are largely responsible for the development and maintenance of the female reproductive system and secondary sexual characteristics. Although circulating estrogens exist in a dynamic equilibrium of metabolic interconversions, estradiol is the principal intracellular human estrogen and is substantially more potent than its metabolites, estrone and estriol, at the receptor level.

The primary source of estrogen in normally cycling adult women is the ovarian follicle, which secretes 70 to 500 mcg of estradiol daily, depending on the phase of the menstrual cycle. After menopause, most endogenous estrogen is produced by conversion of androstenedione, secreted by the adrenal cortex, to estrone by peripheral tissues. Thus, estrone and the sulfate-conjugated form, estrone sulfate, are the most abundant circulating estrogens in postmenopausal women.

Estrogens act through binding to nuclear receptors in estrogen-responsive tissues. At the time of writing, two estrogen receptors have been identified. These vary in proportion from tissue to tissue.

Circulating estrogens modulate the pituitary secretion of the gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH), and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), through a negative feedback mechanism. Estrogens act to reduce the elevated levels of these hormones seen in postmenopausal women.

- **Absorption**: Estrogens used in therapy are well absorbed through the skin, mucous membranes, and gastrointestinal tract. When applied for a local action, absorption is usually sufficient to cause systemic effects.

### Global consensus position statement on the use of testosterone therapy for women [^115TWE1i]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). High credibility.

The international panel concluded that the only evidence-based indication for testosterone therapy for women is the treatment of hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD), with available data supporting a moderate therapeutic effect. There are insufficient data to support the use of testosterone for treating any other symptom or clinical condition, or for disease prevention.

Meta-analyses of the available data show no severe adverse events during physiological testosterone use, with the caveat that women at high cardiometabolic risk were excluded from study populations. The safety of long-term testosterone therapy has not been established.

- **Assessment and diagnosis**: It was considered of utmost importance that the diagnosis of HSDD involves a full clinical assessment, and other factors contributing to female sexual dysfunction (FSD) must be identified and addressed before testosterone therapy is initiated. A blood total testosterone level should not be used to diagnose HSDD. Treatment should only be with formulations that achieve blood concentrations of testosterone approximating premenopausal physiological concentrations.

- **Product use and monitoring**: Because no female product is presently approved by a national regulatory body, male formulations can be judiciously used in female doses, and blood testosterone concentrations must be monitored regularly. The panel recommended against the use of compounded testosterone.

The panel highlighted the pressing need for more research into testosterone therapy for women and the development and licensing of products indicated specifically for women.

### Postmenopausal hormone therapy in clinical perspective [^1121rYHE]. Menopause (2007). Low credibility.

Although many of the risks and benefits of postmenopausal hormone therapy are known, only recently has the magnitude of these effects and their comparison to other therapies become more fully understood. Careful review of randomized controlled trials indicates that the risks of postmenopausal hormone therapy, including breast cancer, stroke, and venous thromboembolism, are similar to other commonly used agents. Overall, these risks are rare (less than 1 event per 1,000 women) and even rarer when initiated in women under 60 years of age or within 10 years of menopause. Additionally, the literature indicates that postmenopausal hormone therapy provides similar benefits to other medications used for the primary prevention of coronary heart disease in women when therapy is initiated in close proximity to menopause.

### Workshop on normal reference ranges for estradiol in postmenopausal women, September 2019, Chicago, Illinois [^117ED91R]. Menopause (2020). Low credibility.

The North American Menopause Society (NAMS) organized the Workshop on Normal Ranges for Estradiol in Postmenopausal Women from September 23 to 24, 2019, in Chicago, Illinois. The aim of the workshop was to review existing analytical methodologies for measuring estradiol in postmenopausal women and to assess existing data and study cohorts of postmenopausal women for their suitability to establish normal postmenopausal ranges. The anticipated outcome of the workshop was to develop recommendations for establishing normal ranges generated with a standardized and certified assay that could be adopted by clinical and research communities. The attendees determined that the term "reference range" was a better descriptor than "normal range" for estradiol measurements in postmenopausal women. Twenty-eight speakers presented during the workshop.

### Testosterone for the treatment of hypoactive sexual desire disorder in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women [^1174dHYa]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2025). Low credibility.

Although there is no androgen deficiency diagnosis for women, research demonstrates that testosterone treatment can be modestly beneficial in treating appropriately selected postmenopausal women with distressing low desire, also known as hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD). Data do not support the role of testosterone treatment in improving bone health, brain health, energy, or cognition in women, and only limited research supports its benefit for HSDD treatment in women of late reproductive age. No U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved formulation of testosterone is available for women in the United States because of a lack of long-term safety data. However, two clinical guidelines now provide expert guidance on testosterone treatment and monitoring in women for HSDD. This narrative review presents the data and summarizes the guidelines in a clinically relevant format to make the information accessible to clinicians treating cisgender women with HSDD seeking testosterone treatment.

### International Society for the Study of Women's Sexual Health clinical practice guideline for the use of systemic testosterone for hypoactive sexual desire disorder in women [^111n8wfL]. Journal of Women's Health (2021). Low credibility.

By 2030, using the age of 50 years as a proxy for menopause, the world population of postmenopausal women will be around 1.2 billion, with an incidence of 47 million reaching menopause each year. In addition, increasing numbers of women experience menopause earlier, with adverse health consequences affecting multiple systems, including those relevant to sexual health, often associated with significant distress.

The terms premature ovarian insufficiency (less than age 40 years) and early menopause (less than age 45 years) describe the spectrum of conditions associated with the loss of ovarian function before the age of natural menopause. Premature ovarian insufficiency and early menopause include both spontaneous primary ovarian insufficiency (idiopathic; caused by chromosomal and genetic defects; associated with autoimmune disorders, infections, metabolic disturbances, environmental factors) and induced ovarian failure resulting from interventions (pelvic radiation therapy, chemotherapy, surgical oophorectomy including risk-reducing bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy in women with BRCA mutations).

Circulating ovarian hormone levels of both estrogens as well as androgens are abruptly decreased and more substantially reduced after surgical menopause than natural menopause. The prevalence of primary ovarian insufficiency in women younger than 40 years is approximately 1%, younger than 30 years, 0.1%, and younger than 20 years, 0.01%, with little difference by ethnicity. Spontaneous early menopause affects approximately another 5% of women between ages 40 and 45 years.

### Estrogens and breast cancer [^116RYczs]. Annals of Oncology (2025). Low credibility.

Even after menopause, women continue to produce low levels of estrogens and progesterone (< 0.5 ng/ml). Postmenopausal estrogens consist of E1 (25–42 pg/ml), the dominant estrogen after menopause, and also E2 (10–25 pg/ml). E3 levels remain low at approximately 6 pg/ml. These estrogens are primarily synthesized by peripheral conversion of androstenedione (0.53 ng/ml) and testosterone (22.2 ng/dl), the androgens produced from postmenopausal ovaries and adrenal glands. Postmenopausal androgen biosynthesis, albeit slightly reduced after menopause, remains comparable to premenopausal levels of androstenedione (0.83 ng/ml) and testosterone (25.8 ng/dl).

Obesity is also associated with elevated levels of estrogens and increased breast cancer risk in postmenopausal women. In premenopausal women, however, obesity is linked to a reduced risk of breast cancer with lower levels of progesterone. It remains unclear whether progesterone levels are elevated in postmenopausal women with obesity, as estrogen levels are. Owing to the limited sensitivity of progesterone assays, it has been challenging to measure accurate concentrations of progesterone in postmenopausal women. Studies indicate that the ovary and adrenal gland are likely to be primary sources of postmenopausal progesterone.

### Recombinant cell ultrasensitive bioassay for measurement of estrogens in postmenopausal women [^11313nzH]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2005). Low credibility.

A recent analysis of data from nine studies provided convincing evidence that plasma estradiol measurements predict the risk of breast cancer in normal postmenopausal women. However, the median values detected by the various assays used in this study varied by five-fold. These and other published data in normal postmenopausal women suggest that assays measuring low plasma estradiol concentrations suffer from problems of sensitivity, specificity, and precision. The availability of a practical, low-cost, specific, precise, and ultrasensitive estrogen assay might allow enhanced prediction of the risk of breast cancer and provide an objective means of selecting postmenopausal women for breast cancer prevention.

A recombinant cell ultrasensitive bioassay (RCUB) for estrogen was recently validated for use in prepubertal children. We postulated that the RCUB might also prove useful for measurement of postmenopausal levels and designed the present study to examine this possibility. Thirty normal postmenopausal volunteers provided blood samples for measurement of estrogen by RCUB and, for comparison, by RIA. The estrogenic activity measured by RCUB [mean ± SD, 11.9 ± 10.9 pmol/liter (SI units, 3.23 ± 2.96 pg/ml)] was significantly lower than estradiol levels measured by RIA [43.7 ± 44.0 pmol/liter (11.9 ± 12.0 pg/ml)] in our volunteer subjects (P < 0.00001). Nonetheless, plasma estradiol levels measured by bioassay were significantly correlated with the estrogenic activity measured by RIA (r = 0.84) and by gas chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (r = 0.85).

### The relationship between bone and reproductive hormones beyond estrogens as well as androgens [^1121XEUe]. Endocrine Reviews (2021). High credibility.

In vivo human studies demonstrate that postmenopausal estrogen deficiency is a major risk factor for osteoporosis. It is now established that estrogen and progesterone work in tandem. Data from the Women's Health Initiative demonstrate that estrogen plus progesterone (compared to placebo) taken for an average of 5.6 years reduces the risk of fractures in postmenopausal women, with a hazard ratio of 0.76 overall. A more recent meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials of more than 1,000 menopausal women reported that estrogen plus progesterone therapy resulted in a superior increase in lumbar BMD compared to estrogen therapy alone, highlighting an additive action for progesterone.

During states of estrogen deficiency such as amenorrhea, and surgical and physiological menopause, low progesterone is almost indistinguishable temporally from low estrogen levels, making it difficult to isolate its effects. However, progesterone deficiency also occurs silently in conditions of subclinical ovulatory disturbance (SOD), whereby ovulation is disturbed with shorter luteal phases but normal cycle length and preserved estrogen levels. SOD therefore provides a useful context for the study of progesterone effects on female bone. Premenopausal women with lower BMD exhibit significantly lower progesterone levels despite regular cycles and frequently normal estrogen levels. Furthermore, studies of healthy premenopausal women have found that levels of bone formation and resorption markers change across the menstrual cycle, with increased markers of bone formation and higher osteoblastic activity occurring during specific phases.

### Low free testosterone levels are associated with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in postmenopausal diabetic women [^111HKz8i]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Hyperandrogenemia is associated with cardiovascular risk factors in women, but evidence about the relationship of testosterone levels with mortality is sparse. We aimed to evaluate whether total testosterone (TT), free testosterone (FT), and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) are associated with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in a cohort of postmenopausal women.

- **Research design and methods**: We measured TT and SHBG levels in 875 postmenopausal women who were referred for coronary angiography during 1997–2000. FT was calculated according to the Vermeulen method. The main outcome measures were Cox proportional hazard ratios (HRs) for mortality from all causes and from cardiovascular causes.

- **Results**: After a median follow-up time of 7.7 years, 179 women (20.5%) had died. There were 101 deaths due to cardiovascular disease (56.4% of all deaths). We found no association of FT, TT, and SHBG levels with mortality in all postmenopausal women. In postmenopausal diabetic women, multivariable-adjusted HRs (with 95% CIs) in the fourth compared with the first FT quartile for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality were 0.38 (0.08–0.90), P = 0.025, and 0.28 (0.08–0.90), P = 0.032, respectively. We found no association of TT and SHBG with mortality in diabetic postmenopausal women.

- **Conclusions**: In postmenopausal diabetic women referred for coronary angiography, low FT levels are independently associated with increased all-cause and cardiovascular mortality.

### Breast effects of oral, combined 17β-estradiol, and progesterone capsules in menopausal women: A randomized controlled trial [^113vipX6]. Menopause (2020). High credibility.

The participants of the study had to meet specific inclusion and exclusion criteria, which have been previously described. In brief, eligible participants were healthy postmenopausal women aged 40 to 65 years, with an intact uterus, a body mass index of ≤ 34.0 kg/m², and seeking treatment for vasomotor symptoms (VMS). Postmenopausal status was defined by one of the following conditions: at least 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea; at least 6 months of spontaneous amenorrhea with a screening serum follicle-stimulating hormone level over 40 mIU/mL; or at least 6 weeks after bilateral oophorectomy.

Eligible women needed to have a normal or nonclinically significant breast examination and a normal mammogram (BI-RADS 1 or 2), which had to be performed at screening or within 6 months prior to the first dose. Women with a BI-RADS 0 (incomplete) screening mammogram were excluded. Additional inclusion and exclusion criteria were typical for hormone therapy assessment studies, as detailed in other sources. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants.

### Low free testosterone levels are associated with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in postmenopausal diabetic women [^117HaYHq]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

In men, as well as in women, it has been shown that testosterone therapy augments anabolic function, leading to increased muscle mass and physical strength. Moreover, testosterone replacement therapy at physiological levels increased muscle mass and improved some cardiovascular risk factors, such as insulin resistance in women with androgen deficiency caused by hypopituitarism. As reviewed by Braunstein, the major adverse reactions to exogenous androgens are androgenic side effects, including hirsutism and acne; testosterone administration to postmenopausal women that results in physiological to slightly supraphysiological serum-free testosterone levels is safe for at least two years. Although there is substantial evidence that testosterone treatment in low-dose regimens has beneficial effects on several aspects, including bone mass, muscle mass, and quality of life, there is insufficient data concerning the long-term safety and side effects of testosterone replacement therapy.

Little is known about the clinical and biochemical features of PCOS after menopause. The definition of postmenopausal PCOS women remains to be determined because menstrual irregularity cannot be assessed in postmenopausal women and polycystic ovary morphology might change over time. The menopausal transition involves many changes regarding women's androgen status. To the best of our knowledge, no large prospective study has been published at the time of writing investigating the association of TT or FT levels with mortality in PCOS women. Considering our results showing an inverse association of FT levels with mortality, further research is needed.

### Low free testosterone levels are associated with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in postmenopausal diabetic women [^112uER76]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Hyperandrogenemia is associated with adverse metabolic features, including insulin resistance, central obesity, dyslipidemia, and chronic inflammation in premenopausal women, which can increase cardiovascular risk. Hyperandrogenemia in premenopausal women is most frequently caused by polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). In a recent meta-analysis, a twofold increased risk for arterial disease was observed in patients with PCOS compared to women without PCOS. BMI adjustment did not affect this finding, suggesting that the increased risk for cardiovascular events in PCOS might be a consequence of hyperandrogenemia rather than obesity per se.

High testosterone levels indicate an increased risk of type 2 diabetes in postmenopausal women and may underlie this association, considering that type 2 diabetes is associated with a 3.5-fold increased mortality. Conversely, low levels of testosterone have been reported in women with atherosclerotic disease. Little is known about the association of androgen levels with mortality in pre- as well as postmenopausal women. The few studies conducted so far have revealed conflicting results. Results from the Rancho Bernardo Study indicate no association of testosterone levels with mortality, whereas Shaw et al. demonstrated that hyperandrogenemia and a history of irregular menses were associated with angiographic coronary artery disease and increased mortality. In contrast, Sievers et al. demonstrated that low total testosterone (TT) levels were associated with increased all-cause mortality and incident cardiovascular events.

### Impact of DHEA supplementation on testosterone and estradiol levels in postmenopausal women: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials assessing dose and duration effects [^114rchcE]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2025). High credibility.

This meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluated the effects of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) supplementation on testosterone and estradiol levels in postmenopausal women. Our analysis of 21 RCTs revealed that DHEA supplementation significantly increased both testosterone and estradiol concentrations, although substantial heterogeneity was observed across the included trials.

Our findings indicate that DHEA is particularly effective in elevating testosterone levels when administered at dosages ≥ 50 mg/day. Additionally, a marked increase in estradiol levels was noted among participants aged ≥ 60 years receiving the same dosage. These findings are consistent with a previous meta-analysis by Li et al, which reported increased testosterone levels in participants receiving > 50 mg/day of DHEA for ≤ 12 weeks, particularly among those under 60 years of age. Similarly, Zhu et al. found that estradiol concentrations were significantly increased in participants aged ≥ 60 years who received ≥ 50 mg/day of DHEA for ≥ 26 weeks. The variation in effective intervention duration may stem from differences in study populations. Our meta-analysis focused exclusively on postmenopausal women, which may have contributed to differing results compared to previous analyses involving broader populations.

Most of the included trials in our study had an intervention duration of 6 to 12 months; therefore, we used 26 weeks (approximately 6 months) as the stratification threshold. While the average increase in estradiol was 7.86 pg/mL, this change may be clinically meaningful.

### Global consensus position statement on the use of testosterone therapy for women [^114kXfbP]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Low credibility.

Recommendations

- **Measurement of testosterone, female sexual dysfunction, and endogenous androgen levels**: Testosterone may act directly via the androgen receptor/nongenomic androgenic action or by reduction to the more potent androgen dihydrotestosterone and/or aromatization to estradiol and their metabolites. Testosterone concentrations decline during the reproductive years (Level IIB). Testosterone concentrations appear to be maintained in women beyond the age of 65 years, but whether this confers a benefit is yet to be understood (Level IIB).

- **Assessment methods**: Total testosterone can be measured with high accuracy and reproducibility using liquid/gas chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry assays (Grade B). Direct assays for the measurement of total and free testosterone are highly unreliable in the female range (Grade A). Reference laboratories should be "harmonized" with biological standards in coordination with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Expert Opinion).

- **Clinical practice implications**: Measurement of testosterone using direct assays in clinical practice is appropriate if liquid/gas chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry assay is not available, to exclude high baseline concentrations and also to exclude supraphysiological concentrations during treatment (Expert Opinion).

Research into testosterone physiology and clinical effects should mainly focus on measuring total testosterone as the main biomarker rather than "free" testosterone because evidence that "free" testosterone is the biologic.

### Global consensus position statement on the use of testosterone therapy for women [^117GX1vK]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Low credibility.

- **Recommendations regarding other androgenic preparations**: Systemic dehydroepiandrosterone is not associated with significant improvement in libido or sexual function in postmenopausal women with normal adrenal function and cannot be recommended for women with hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) (Level IA, Grade A). In the absence of vulvovaginal atrophy, vaginal dehydroepiandrosterone has not been tested and thus cannot be recommended for treatment of HSDD (Expert Opinion).

- **Recommendations regarding the design of future trials of physiologically dosed testosterone**: More adequately powered, double-blind randomized controlled trials (RCTs), without selection bias and with consistent reporting of standardized outcomes, are needed to comprehensively establish the benefits and risks of testosterone therapy for women. For studies of testosterone and female sexual dysfunction (FSD), relief of the distress associated with sexual dysfunction is a primary aim of FSD treatment. Presently, no questionnaire covers all domains of female sexual function, suggesting that a combination of domains from different questionnaires should be used. Satisfying sexual events should no longer be used as a primary efficacy measurement in clinical trials of women with FSD. A set of clearly defined core outcomes needs to be established. There is a need for an instrument to assess sexual function with the following characteristics: general applicability, not disease-specific, and high discriminant validity between women diagnosed with FSD and sexually functional women. Moreover, the instrument should be validated to measure FSD per se and as a tool to screen for and diagnose FSD.

### Follicle-stimulating hormone, its association with cardiometabolic risk factors, and 10-year risk of cardiovascular disease in postmenopausal women [^115E9aAr]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). High credibility.

Readers may have concerns that estrogens protect women from cardiovascular disease (CVD); however, participants with higher follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) had lower estradiol as shown in Table 1. It is possible that participants with higher FSH also had better metabolic parameters. The associations between FSH and metabolic parameters were independent of estradiol, as demonstrated in Figure 2, which led to a negative association between FSH and calculated 10-year CVD risk. The equations calculating the 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk did not include estradiol, indicating that estradiol fluctuates at such a low level in postmenopausal women that it may not influence 10-year ASCVD risk. Some studies found that estradiol levels were not associated with the risk of CVD in hormone replacement nonusers after menopause.

Our study had several strengths. First, it presented a novel association between FSH and 10-year ASCVD risk for the first time in a large sample. Second, the study was conducted in a general population as opposed to a clinic-based population, providing better external validity of the results.

### Global consensus position statement on the use of testosterone therapy for women [^111WHfat]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism (2019). Low credibility.

- **Recommendations regarding the effects of testosterone on wellbeing, mood, and cognition in postmenopausal women**: There is insufficient evidence to support the use of testosterone to enhance cognitive performance or to delay cognitive decline in postmenopausal women. Available data show no effect of testosterone therapy on general wellbeing (Level I, Grade A). Testosterone may improve wellbeing in premenopausal women, but data are inconclusive (Level I, Grade B). Available data do not show an effect of testosterone on depressed mood (Level I, Grade B).

- **Recommendations regarding the musculoskeletal effects of testosterone**: Few studies have evaluated the musculoskeletal effects of testosterone. Of the studies that have reported musculoskeletal outcomes, the number of included participants has been small, all participants were taking estrogen therapy, and no studies have been in women with osteoporosis. The available data do not support an effect of testosterone treatment on bone mineral density at the spine, total hip, or femoral neck at 12 months (Level I, Grade A). No statistically significant effect of testosterone administered in physiologic doses has been demonstrated on lean body mass, total body fat, or muscle strength (Level I, Grade A). There is a need for clinical trials to evaluate the impact of testosterone treatment on musculoskeletal tissues (Expert Opinion).

### Approach to investigation of hyperandrogenism in a postmenopausal woman [^113DtnGN]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Low credibility.

Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is considered the most frequent endocrine disorder in women of reproductive age, with a prevalence between 8% and 13% depending on the diagnostic criteria and population studied. According to the Rotterdam criteria, at least two of the following three criteria are required for a diagnosis: oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea; biochemical or clinical hyperandrogenism, such as hirsutism and acne; and polycystic ovarian morphology. There are no specific criteria to diagnose PCOS after menopause. The Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guideline has suggested that a diagnosis of PCOS in a postmenopausal woman can be based upon a history of oligo/amenorrhea and hyperandrogenism during the reproductive years.

The reproductive phenotype of PCOS usually improves with age due to the loss of ovarian follicles, leading to more regular cycles and decreased ovarian volume. However, the decrease in ovarian volume and serum AMH during the menopausal transition may be relatively less in women with PCOS than in other women. Consequently, the average age of menopause is approximately two years later in women with PCOS than in healthy controls. As androgen levels gradually decrease with age, symptoms of hyperandrogenism like hirsutism may improve in women with PCOS. Nevertheless, the prevalence of hirsutism was significantly higher in postmenopausal women with PCOS than in control women (33% vs. 4%) at a mean age of 81 years, as reported in a Swedish long-term follow-up study.

PCOS is considered a relatively mild form of hyperandrogenism since circulating levels of…

### The effects of postmenopausal hormone therapy on serum estrogen, progesterone, and sex hormone-binding globulin levels in healthy postmenopausal women [^112WF7MX]. Menopause (2010). Low credibility.

Differences in disease outcomes between users and nonusers of hormone therapy (HT) and between users of estrogen therapy (ET) and users of estrogen + progesterone therapy (EPT) may relate to differences in serum hormone concentrations between these populations. In this study, we examined the response of serum hormone levels in healthy postmenopausal women after 1 year of HT.

- **Methods**: A representative subsample of 200 healthy adherent participants from the active and placebo groups of the Women's Health Initiative randomized controlled clinical trials of ET (conjugated equine estrogens 0.625 mg daily) or EPT (ET plus medroxyprogesterone acetate 2.5 mg daily) were selected for the determination of selected sex hormone levels at baseline and 1 year after randomization.

- **Results**: In participants receiving active ET intervention compared with placebo, estrogenic hormone levels increased from baseline to year 1 by 3.6-fold for total estrone, 2.7-fold for total estradiol, and 1.8-fold for bioavailable and free estradiol concentrations. Serum sex hormone-binding globulin concentrations also increased 2.5-fold. In contrast, progesterone levels decreased slightly in women taking exogenous EPT. The response of serum estrogens and sex hormone-binding globulin did not differ substantially with the addition of progesterone. In subgroup analyses, hormone response varied by age, ethnicity, body mass index, smoking status, vasomotor symptoms, and baseline hormone levels.

- **Conclusions**: These data provide a reference point for the serum hormone response to HT and demonstrate that.

### Low progesterone and low estradiol levels associate with abdominal aortic aneurysms in men [^116KzySE]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Low credibility.

Increased understanding of the sexual dimorphism in human AAA may provide important clues to the pathogenesis and potential treatment targets of AAA. In premenopausal women, levels of progesterone and estradiol show great variation across the menstrual cycle but are generally much higher than in men. The results of this study not only raise the question of whether high progesterone and estradiol are protective in men, but also whether women are protected against AAA by their relatively higher levels of these sex hormones during the reproductive period. Indeed, while most available studies in women are limited by small study sizes, recent data from a large cohort of postmenopausal women suggest that premature menopause may be an important risk factor for AAA in women with a significant smoking history.

Increased knowledge of the role of sex hormones in AAA disease may also be of high clinical relevance. Prostate and breast cancer, the most common cancers in men and women, respectively, are both sex hormone–dependent, and drugs that suppress sex hormone production or action are foundations of their treatment. Hormone deficiencies, for example, in menopausal women as well as androgen-deficient men, are supplemented in large groups of patients. Increased cardiovascular risk has been reported for androgen deprivation therapy of men with prostate cancer as well as for testosterone treatment of elderly men, and a high incidence of AAA has been detected in men with prostate cancer. If and how treatments that target the sex hormone system affect AAA risk should be explored in future studies.

### Breast effects of oral, combined 17β-estradiol, and progesterone capsules in menopausal women: a randomized controlled trial [^111L5a7g]. Menopause (2020). High credibility.

Statistical analysis: The overall study sample size was determined based on the primary safety and efficacy endpoints as previously described. A post hoc power determination was made on the sample of women with mammogram data. With approximately 100 women in the placebo group and 300 women in an active treatment group, the study had an estimated power of 74% to detect a difference of a threefold increase (e.g. from 3% with placebo to 12% with an active dose) in the incidence of abnormal mammograms (BI-RADS 3 or 4). Baseline and demographic characteristics were descriptively summarized by treatment group. The incidence of adverse events (AEs) was calculated with the number of women in the safety population as the denominator (n = 1,835). The incidence of abnormal mammograms was calculated using the number of women with specific mammogram findings (e.g. BI-RAD 1/2 or 3/4) as the numerator and the number of women with available mammograms as the denominator. For women who had more than one follow-up mammogram, only the last one was included as the study-end mammogram. Analysis was performed using SAS v.9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).

### Serum levels of allopregnanolone, progesterone and testosterone in menstrually-related and postmenopausal migraine: A cross-sectional study [^116oykiF]. Cephalalgia (2020). Low credibility.

**Results**: Analyses of allopregnanolone, progesterone, and testosterone in fertile women showed that allopregnanolone levels were significantly lower in women with migraine in the MM group (mean value ± SD: 52 ± 18 pg/mL) compared to the FAC control group (mean value ± SD: 78 ± 36 pg/mL, p < 0.001, one-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey-Kramer post-hoc comparison test). Cohen's d value for allopregnanolone serum levels between PM and PC was −3.71 [−4.69 ÷ −2.72]. Postmenopausal women with migraine (PM) presented serum levels similar to those in the PC group.

### Physical activity and sex hormone levels in estradiol- and placebo-treated postmenopausal women [^111DRKL4]. Menopause (2011). Low credibility.

Postmenopausal changes in the hormonal milieu in women with or without hormone therapy are hypothesized to be the pathway for a number of menopause-associated modifications in physiology and disease risk. Physical activity may modify these changes in women's hormone profiles. The crucial yet complex relationship between physical activity and physiologic and pharmacologic sex hormone levels in postmenopausal women has not been investigated sufficiently.

- **Methods**: Using structured recall, physical activity was assessed longitudinally during a period of 2 years in 194 postmenopausal women (90 randomized to 1 mg 17β-estradiol treatment daily and 104 randomized to placebo) in the Estrogen in the Prevention of Atherosclerosis Trial. The levels of physical activity were correlated with the serum sex hormone and the serum hormone-binding globulin levels in each treatment group.

- **Results**: Among the placebo-treated women, total energy expenditure was positively associated with sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG; P < 0.001) and inversely associated with testosterones (total, bioavailable, or free) as well as androstenedione (P < 0.001 for all), as well as with estradiol (P = 0.02). In estradiol-treated women, estradiol levels were inversely associated with total energy expenditure (P = 0.002) and weekly hours spent in moderate or more vigorous physical activity (P = 0.001).

- **Conclusions**: Physical activity is associated with lower serum levels of estradiol in both hormone therapy-treated and untreated women. In placebo-treated women only, physical activity is associated with reduced levels of testosterones as well as androstenedione.

### Low free testosterone levels are associated with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in postmenopausal diabetic women [^116tZPYZ]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Hyperandrogenemia is associated with cardiovascular risk factors in women, but evidence about the relationship of testosterone levels with mortality is sparse. We aimed to evaluate whether total testosterone (TT), free testosterone (FT), and sex hormone–binding globulin (SHBG) are associated with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in a cohort of postmenopausal women.

We measured TT and SHBG levels in 875 postmenopausal women who were referred for coronary angiography during 1997–2000. FT was calculated according to the Vermeulen method. The main outcome measures were Cox proportional hazard ratios (HRs) for mortality from all causes and from cardiovascular causes.

After a median follow-up time of 7.7 years, 179 women (20.5%) had died. There were 101 deaths due to cardiovascular disease (56.4% of all deaths). We found no association of FT, TT, and SHBG levels with mortality in all postmenopausal women. In postmenopausal diabetic women, multivariable-adjusted HRs (with 95% CIs) in the fourth compared with the first FT quartile for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality were 0.38 (0.08–0.90), P = 0.025, and 0.28 (0.08–0.90), P = 0.032, respectively. We found no association of TT and SHBG with mortality in diabetic postmenopausal women.

In postmenopausal diabetic women referred for coronary angiography, low FT levels are independently associated with increased all-cause and cardiovascular mortality.

### Testosterone for peri- and postmenopausal women [^111UgDyR]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

The value of adding testosterone to hormone therapy (HT) for the management of peri- and postmenopausal women is controversial and has not been systematically reviewed.

- **Objectives**: To determine the benefits and risks of testosterone therapy for peri- and postmenopausal women taking hormone therapy.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Trials Register (1st November 2003), The Cochrane Library (Issue 2, 2003), MEDLINE (1966 to 1st November 2003), EMBASE (1980 to 1st November 2003), Biological Abstracts (1969 to 2002), PsycINFO (1972 to 1st November 2003), CINAHL (1982 to 1st November 2003), and reference lists of articles. We also contacted pharmaceutical companies and researchers in the field.

- **Selection criteria**: Studies that were randomized comparisons of testosterone plus hormone therapy versus hormone therapy alone in peri- or postmenopausal women.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors assessed the quality of the trials and extracted data independently. Where it was necessary, the corresponding authors of eligible trials were contacted for additional information. For dichotomous outcomes, Peto odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated. For continuous outcomes, non-skewed data from valid scales were synthesized using a weighted mean difference or standardized mean difference. If statistical heterogeneity was found, a random-effects model was used and reasons for the heterogeneity were explored and discussed.

- **Main results**: Twenty-three trials with 1957 participants were included.

### Androgen therapy for loss of desire in women: is the benefit worth the breast cancer risk [^1131uH24]. Fertility and Sterility (2008). Low credibility.

To contrast the limited evidence that androgen therapy is an effective treatment for low sexual desire in women with the extensive literature suggesting that androgens promote breast cancer.

- **Design**: Evidence from population studies of women is reviewed on the association between endogenous androgen levels and sexual function or satisfaction. Recent randomized trials of testosterone therapy for low desire are critiqued in terms of methodology and generalizability. Research on endogenous testosterone levels and breast cancer risk in both premenopausal and postmenopausal women is summarized, as are recent studies of androgenic hormonal therapy and breast cancer risk.

- **Setting**: Literature review.

- **Results**: Endogenous androgen levels are not correlated with sexual desire in population-based studies of aging women. Factors that are strongly associated with low desire include pain with sexual activity, emotional distress, life stress, and relationship conflict. The efficacy of testosterone therapy for women's desire problems is modest. Expectancy effects were not adequately controlled in randomized trials. Epidemiological findings agree that higher endogenous serum androgen levels confer increased breast cancer risk both before and after menopause. Androgenic hormonal replacement regimens also increase the risk of breast cancer.

Testosterone supplementation should not be prescribed to women with low sexual desire unless long-term studies can demonstrate safety and efficacy.

### Transdermal testosterone therapy improves well-being, mood, and sexual function in premenopausal women [^117SGgXp]. Menopause (2003). High credibility.

Circulating testosterone in women declines during the late reproductive years, resulting in women in their 40s having approximately half the testosterone level compared to women in their 20s. Despite this decline, research on the benefits of androgen replacement has been limited mainly to postmenopausal women. In light of the physiological decline in testosterone during premenopause, we have investigated the efficacy of transdermal testosterone therapy on mood, well-being, and sexual function in eugonadal, premenopausal women experiencing low libido.

- **Design**: Premenopausal women with low libido participated in a randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover efficacy study of testosterone cream (10 mg/day). The study included two double-blind, 12-week treatment phases separated by a single-blind, 4-week washout period.

- **Results**: Thirty-four women completed the study per protocol, and 31 women (mean age 39.7 ± 4.2 years; serum testosterone 1.07 ± 0.50 nmol/L) provided complete data. Testosterone therapy led to statistically significant improvements in the composite scores of the Psychological General Well-Being Index [+12.9 (95% CI, +4.6 to +21.2), P = 0.003] and the Sabbatsberg Sexual Self-Rating Scale [+15.7 (95% CI, +6.5 to +25.0), P = 0.001] compared with placebo. A mean decrease in the Beck Depression Inventory score approached significance [-2.8 (95% CI, -5.7 to +0.1), P = 0.06]. Mean total testosterone levels during treatment were at the high end of the normal range, and estradiol levels remained unchanged. No adverse effects were reported.

Testosterone therapy improved mood, well-being, and sexual function in premenopausal women with low libido without causing adverse effects.
