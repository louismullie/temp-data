## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the indications for bullectomy in COPD. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core pathophysiologic rationale that makes bullectomy beneficial. Then, I should verify the anatomic threshold that defines a "large" or "giant" bulla. Next, I will review the clinical indications, including symptomatic disease and complications. After that, I need to check the prerequisite of optimized medical therapy and multidisciplinary selection. I will then examine contraindications and risk modifiers, followed by expected benefits and outcomes. Finally, I should consider alternatives for inoperable patients and synthesize a concise indication statement with evidence grading and practical pearls for implementation.

> Let me first confirm the pathophysiologic rationale. Giant emphysematous bullae can compress adjacent, relatively preserved lung parenchyma, impairing ventilation and gas exchange and worsening hyperinflation; removing the bulla can decompress viable lung, improve mechanics, and enhance respiratory muscle and cardiac performance, which is the mechanistic foundation for benefit after bullectomy [^112B3SwQ] [^116Af1jU].

> I need to verify the anatomic threshold that triggers consideration. Multiple authoritative sources converge on a size criterion of roughly one-third of the hemithorax as defining a "large" or "giant" bulla; some literature uses "occupying more than one-third", others "about one-third", and some describe bullae filling up to half the thoracic volume in extreme cases, all indicating substantial mass effect on adjacent lung tissue [^112ys9Wj] [^112B3SwQ] [^111Syv4u].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about symptoms alone; I should confirm the clinical indications. The primary indication is persistent dyspnea attributable to a large bulla despite optimized medical therapy, with additional indications including complications such as recurrent or non-resolving pneumothorax, infection within the bulla, hemoptysis, and progressive enlargement with increasing compression; case series and surgical cohorts consistently report that symptom relief is achievable in appropriately selected patients [^116WksuU] [^112ys9Wj] [^112B3SwQ].

> Wait, let me verify the prerequisite of medical optimization. Bullectomy is not first-line; patients should undergo comprehensive medical therapy including bronchodilators, smoking cessation, vaccination, and pulmonary rehabilitation, and be reassessed for persistent, bulla-related symptoms or complications before surgical referral, aligning with GOLD's emphasis on structured phenotyping and multidisciplinary selection for interventional therapies in emphysema [^116LJxmR] [^115a465W].

> I should double-check contraindications and risk modifiers that temper benefit. Diffuse homogeneous emphysema without compressible adjacent lung, severe pulmonary hypertension, significant cor pulmonale, very low FEV₁ with poor DLCO, and high-risk surgical profiles increase perioperative risk and diminish functional gains; careful selection using CT morphology, pulmonary function testing, and hemodynamic assessment is essential, and larger bulla size and underlying diffuse emphysema have been associated with higher morbidity in surgical series [^111Syv4u] [^116WksuU] [^116LJxmR].

> Let me consider expected benefits and durability. In selected patients, bullectomy improves dyspnea, increases FEV₁ on the order of hundreds of milliliters, reduces hyperinflation, and enhances exercise tolerance; benefits appear durable for years in many patients, though those with underlying diffuse emphysema experience more rapid postoperative decline than those with focal disease, and VATS approaches can achieve outcomes comparable to open surgery with less physiologic insult [^116WksuU] [^115bLXUR] [^112ys9Wj].

> But wait, what if the patient is high surgical risk or declines surgery? I should review alternatives. For inoperable patients, bronchoscopic options such as endobronchial valves, lung coils, or thermal vapor ablation can be considered in specialized centers, and in select cases of bulla-related persistent air leak or poor surgical candidacy, chemical or blood-patch pleurodesis may be attempted; these strategies are generally reserved for carefully phenotyped emphysema and are not direct substitutes for bullectomy in giant bulla disease [^11439YtH] [^114aAmvs] [^112B3SwQ].

> I will now synthesize the indication succinctly. Bullectomy is indicated for patients with COPD and a large emphysematous bulla — typically occupying at least one-third of the hemithorax — that compresses adjacent viable lung and causes persistent dyspnea or complications such as recurrent or non-resolving pneumothorax, infection, or hemoptysis, despite optimized medical therapy, provided there is no prohibitive diffuse disease, severe pulmonary hypertension, or prohibitive surgical risk, and the case has been vetted by a multidisciplinary team [^112B3SwQ] [^115cmYYP] [^116LJxmR].

> Hold on, I should verify the evidence level and grading. GOLD assigns an Evidence C rating to bullectomy recommendations, reflecting benefits demonstrated in observational cohorts and expert consensus rather than randomized trials; this aligns with the historical absence of RCTs for this specific surgical niche and the reliance on case series and prospective cohorts for outcome data [^1158bC2o] [^116cEnWn].

> Let me reconsider practical pearls to ensure nothing is missed. High-resolution CT is indispensable to define bulla size, number, location, adjacent parenchymal compressibility, and fissure integrity; pulmonary function testing and, when indicated, cardiopulmonary exercise testing help quantify baseline impairment and anticipate postoperative gains; and preoperative smoking cessation and intensive medical optimization reduce complications and improve outcomes, consistent with GOLD's perioperative risk mitigation principles in COPD [^116LJxmR] [^115a465W].

Bullectomy is indicated in COPD patients with **giant bullae (> 1/3 hemithorax)** [^112B3SwQ] that cause **significant dyspnea, impaired lung function, or complications** (recurrent pneumothorax, infection, hemoptysis) despite optimized medical therapy [^115cmYYP]. It is most beneficial when the bulla compresses viable lung and the patient has **preserved underlying lung function** [^114nNVMp]; patients with diffuse emphysema, severe hyperinflation, or very low FEV₁ are less likely to benefit and have higher risk [^115bLXUR]. Bullectomy is not routinely indicated for small or asymptomatic bullae; patient selection should be guided by CT imaging, pulmonary function tests, and multidisciplinary evaluation [^116LJxmR].

## Indications for bullectomy in COPD

### Anatomical criteria

Large bullae are typically **> 1/3 of the hemithorax** [^112B3SwQ] and compress adjacent lung tissue, impairing ventilation and gas exchange [^112B3SwQ]. Single or few bullae are preferred over multiple or diffuse bullae, as the latter indicate widespread emphysema and poorer surgical outcomes [^115bLXUR].

---

### Clinical criteria

- **Significant dyspnea**: Persistent, disabling dyspnea despite optimized medical therapy, including bronchodilators, inhaled corticosteroids, and pulmonary rehabilitation [^116LJxmR].

- **Impaired lung function**: Reduced FEV₁ and increased residual volume due to bullous compression of functional lung tissue [^112B3SwQ].

- **Complications**: Recurrent pneumothorax, infection, or hemoptysis attributable to the bulla [^112ys9Wj].

---

### Physiological criteria

Preserved underlying lung function indicates relatively intact lung parenchyma outside the bulla and predicts **better postoperative recovery** [^112ys9Wj]. Absence of severe hyperinflation suggests less extensive emphysema and a greater likelihood of benefit from bullectomy [^notfound].

---

## Contraindications and relative contraindications

- **Diffuse emphysema**: Widespread emphysema without localized bullae indicates poor surgical candidates due to limited benefit and high risk [^115bLXUR].

- **Severe hyperinflation**: Marked hyperinflation or very low FEV₁ (< 20% predicted) increases surgical risk and reduces benefit [^114FgK2U].

- **Severe pulmonary hypertension**: Significant pulmonary hypertension or cor pulmonale contraindicates bullectomy due to high perioperative risk [^notfound].

- **Poor general health**: Significant comorbidities, poor nutritional status, or inability to tolerate surgery or anesthesia [^113DL6Ud].

---

## Preoperative evaluation

- **Imaging**: High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) to assess bulla size, location, and underlying lung structure [^112ys9Wj].

- **Pulmonary function tests**: Evaluate baseline lung function and predict postoperative outcomes [^116aZVfm].

- **Multidisciplinary team**: Involvement of pulmonologists, thoracic surgeons, and radiologists to optimize patient selection and surgical planning [^116LJxmR].

---

## Expected outcomes and benefits

Bullectomy can significantly **improve dyspnea, exercise capacity, and quality of life** in appropriately selected patients [^115bLXUR]. Lung function typically improves postoperatively, with increases in FEV₁ and reductions in residual volume [^116WksuU]. Complication rates vary, with persistent air leak being the most common, but overall morbidity and mortality are acceptable in experienced centers [^116WksuU].

## Summary of indications

| **Criteria** | **Indication for bullectomy** |
|-|-|
| Anatomical | - Large bullae (> 1/3 hemithorax) [^112B3SwQ] <br/> - Localized disease [^116Af1jU] |
| Clinical | - Significant dyspnea <br/> - Impaired lung function <br/> - Complications (pneumothorax, infection, hemoptysis) [^112ys9Wj] |
| Physiological | - Preserved underlying lung function <br/> - Absence of severe hyperinflation [^notfound] |
| Contraindications | - Diffuse emphysema <br/> - Severe hyperinflation <br/> - Severe pulmonary hypertension <br/> - Poor general health [^notfound] |

Bullectomy is indicated in COPD patients with **large, localized bullae** causing significant symptoms or complications, provided they have preserved underlying lung function and no major contraindications. Careful patient selection and multidisciplinary evaluation are essential to optimize outcomes [^116LJxmR].

Lung volume reduction therapies in advanced COPD may complement standard medical therapy, with bullectomy benefiting selected patients who harbor giant bullae occupying one-third of the ipsilateral hemithorax. The National Emphysema Treatment Trial suggested that patients with severe COPD defined as an FEV₁ < 45% predicted and reduced exercise capacity — defined as maximal exercise capacity < 25 W for women and 40 W for men on a standard incremental cycle ergometer test — may experience improvements with lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS); however, the therapy is costly, with a cost-effectiveness ratio of $98,000 per 1 quality-adjusted life year saved over 3 years, and 90% of patients who undergo LVRS experience significant air leaks, and none have received regulatory approval for use in COPD owing to limited efficacy and concerns about increased risk of pneumonia and exacerbations. We recommend: Studies to evaluate whether or not minimally invasive surgical techniques can reduce complication rates and improve perioperative outcomes and costs compared with conventional surgical techniques; Studies to evaluate whether or not the benefits of LVRS observed in trials during the late 1990s and early 2000s are still applicable in the current era in light of advances in medical management for COPD; Studies to evaluate bronchoscopic lung volume reduction techniques that are intended to increase benefits and reduce complications, especially those related to pneumonia.

Bullectomy for emphysema — Giant bullectomy is a rare, but effective procedure for surgical resection of a bulla that occupies > one-third of a hemithorax and compresses adjacent viable lung tissue, with reported reductions in dyspnea and improvements in lung, respiratory muscle and cardiac performance and exercise tolerance; for patients unfit for resection, blood or thrombin instillation may be effective.

### Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 10: bullectomy, lung volume reduction surgery, and transplantation for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^111Syv4u]. Thorax (2003). Low credibility.

There are currently three surgical treatments for emphysema: bullectomy, lung transplantation, and lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS). Unfortunately, most emphysema patients are poor candidates for any surgical intervention. A meticulous selection process is favoured in which indications and contraindications are considered and the best solution is devised for each patient. Patients with giant bullae filling half the thoracic volume and compressing relatively normal adjacent parenchyma are offered bullectomy; those with hyperinflation, heterogeneous distribution of destruction, forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV₁) > 20%, and a normal carbon dioxide tension (PCO₂) are offered LVRS; and patients with diffuse disease, lower FEV₁, hypercapnia, and associated pulmonary hypertension are directed towards transplantation. Using these criteria, few patients are serious candidates for surgical procedures. Combinations of LVRS and lung transplantation, either simultaneously or sequentially, are possible but rarely necessary.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^116LJxmR]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Interventional and surgical therapies for COPD — selection principles emphasize that lung structural related therapies include airway and emphysematous predominant treatments, and that phenotyping patients with clinical, physiological, and imaging tests is critical to select appropriate candidates and in assessing the benefits, timing, and type of intervention to be performed; multidisciplinary collaboration of pulmonology, thoracic surgery and imaging disciplines are necessary to ensure quality outcomes. Airway predominant treatments are currently the subject of Phase III clinical trials; emphysematous based treatments include bullectomy, lung volume reduction surgery, bronchoscopic lung reduction and in select cases, lung transplantation. Surgical and interventional treatments for patients with emphysema depends upon the severity of patient symptoms despite optimized medical treatment, the specific structural abnormalities and features of the lung seen on CT imaging, the presence of pulmonary and non-pulmonary comorbid conditions, physiological assessment, and the balance of benefits and risks for the individual patient.

Interventional therapy in stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) includes surgical and bronchoscopic options with defined indications and evidence levels. Lung volume reduction surgery improves survival in severe emphysema patients with upper-lobe emphysema and low post-rehabilitation exercise capacity (Evidence A). In selected patients, bullectomy is associated with decreased dyspnea, improved lung function and exercise tolerance (Evidence C). In appropriately selected patients with very severe COPD, lung transplantation has been shown to improve quality of life and functional capacity (Evidence C); in very severe COPD (progressive disease, BODE score of 7 to 10, and not candidates for lung volume reduction), lung transplantation may be considered for referral with criteria including history of hospitalization for exacerbation associated with acute hypercapnia (Pco₂ > 50 mmHg), pulmonary hypertension and/or cor pulmonale despite oxygen therapy, or FEV₁ ≤ 20% with either DLco < 20% or homogenous distribution of emphysema (Evidence C). In select patients with advanced emphysema, bronchoscopic interventions reduce end expiratory lung volume and improve exercise tolerance, health status and lung function at 6–12 months following treatment, including endobronchial valves (Evidence A), lung coils (Evidence B), and vapor ablation (Evidence B). Phase III trials are currently being conducted for refractory exacerbations and chronic bronchitis using cryospray, rheoplasty and targeted lung denervation technology.

### Surgical treatment of bilateral vanishing lung syndrome: a case report [^115HXw7a]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Volume reduction surgery is a routine treatment method for lung emphysema in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients. The formation of giant bullous emphysema is an indication for surgical bullectomy. Bilateral giant bullae severely compromise lung function and complicate surgical treatment.

Case Presentation

We present the algorithm for surgical treatment and correction of complications in a 38-year-old male with bilateral giant bullae (vanishing lung syndrome), severe COPD. Primarily the patient was admitted with a mild cough, mucopurulent sputum and dyspnea. A CT scan revealed bilateral giant bullae, displacing up to 50% of lung volume. A two-stage surgical bullectomy was planned, yet postoperative complications due to secondary bullae rupture prompted urgent revision with contralateral bullae resection. After complete bullectomy, severely reduced lung volume was successfully managed throughout a long postoperative rehabilitation period. At 5year follow-up, spirometry indicators and radiological examination show significantly improved and stable lung function.

Conclusion

This clinical case demonstrates the technical difficulties and possible complications of extended bilateral lung resections in patients with severe vanishing lung syndrome. Single-stage treatment of bilateral giant bullous emphysema is recommended to minimize postoperative complications and reduce risk of bullae rupture. Positive long-term outcome outweighs possible complications of surgical treatment.

### Surgical interventions for emphysema [^116Af1jU]. Seminars in Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Three surgical procedures are pertinent to the treatment of end-stage emphysema: giant bullectomy, lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS), and lung transplantation. Patients with localized disease manifesting as a giant bulla that compresses adjacent healthy lung tissues can be offered bullectomy. Patients with diffuse disease can be offered LVRS, lung transplantation, or staged LVRS/lung transplant, depending on multiple factors including age, lung function parameters, lobar predominance, and whether the disease is uni- or bilateral. Since end-stage emphysema is refractory to most medical treatment, surgery is often the only remaining option.

### Surgical therapies for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^113UCjaF]. Respiratory Care (2004). Low credibility.

Surgical procedures for treating emphysema were first developed nearly 100 years ago. Despite a wide range of surgical procedures performed over the years, only three appear to have true clinical benefit: bullectomy, lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS), and lung transplantation. Lung volume reduction surgery has been reintroduced in the past decade and is currently under active research. A recent large, multicenter trial showed LVRS to improve quality of life, exercise capacity, and even survival in certain highly selected patients. Some individuals with emphysema may be candidates for either LVRS or lung transplantation. Patient-selection criteria for these procedures are being developed.

"Some of these therapies (vapor ablation and lung coils) are not widely available for clinical care in many countries". Additionally, "In selected patients with a large bulla, surgical bullectomy may be considered", and "In selected patients with very severe COPD and without relevant contraindications, lung transplantation may be considered".

Surgical and Endoscopic Lung Volume Reduction

In selected patients with symptomatic heterogeneous or homogeneous emphysema and significant hyperinflation refractory to optimized medical care, surgical or bronchoscopic modes of lung volume reduction may be considered (Figure 7). In patients with a large bulla, surgical bullectomy is an option, and in selected patients with very severe COPD and without relevant contraindications, lung transplantation may be considered.

Surgical and interventional therapies in advanced emphysema. Homogeneous emphysema was defined as a < 10% difference in emphysematous destruction between the targeted and ipsilateral nontargeted lobe undergoing lung reduction as measured using quantitative chest CT imaging. By contrast, a greater than 10% difference between the targeted and nontargeted lobe is considered a heterogeneous pattern of emphysematous destruction. CT = computed tomography.

End-of-Life and Palliative Care

All patients with advanced COPD should be considered for end-of-life and palliative care support to optimize symptom control and allow patients and their families to make informed choices about future management.

### Why are thoracic operations postponed? [^1124aL2B]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Morbid patients with history of COPD and cardiological problems, mostly with advanced age and belonging to the male gender, are the ones most frequently having their thoracic procedure postponed. Another interesting finding is that among cases of postponement for medical reasons, patients planned for major/oncologic surgery (lobectomy, bilobectomy, pulmonectomy) have their operation more usually postponed than patients planned for minor or surgery for benign disease, such as biopsies, or bullectomy and pleurodesis. This can probably be explained both by the fact that patients with sever oncological problems often also face other comorbidities, as well as by the fact that patients planned for major surgery generally have the need for more thorough and meticulous preoperative preparation.

We hope that the aforementioned conclusions will assist thoracic surgeons, anaesthesiologists and nursing staff dealing with this important category of patients in avoiding such cases of postponement in the future.

### Evidence of mycobacterial disease in COPD patients with lung volume reduction surgery; the importance of histological assessment of specimens: a cohort study [^114bx2aP]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Methods

The clinical records of 126 consecutive patients who underwent LVRS or bullectomy at the Royal Brompton Hospital from 2000–2013, were retrospectively reviewed for demographic, clinical, lung function, surgical, radiological, microbiological and histological data. All patients underwent pulmonary rehabilitation prior to surgery and had a thorough pre-operative work up, including chest radiographs (CXR) and/or CT scans and lung function tests. Indications for LVRS/bullectomy: emphysema with destruction and marked hyperinflation; substantial bulla identified on CXR; a marked functional impairment; a marked reduction in activities of daily living; a failure of maximum medical treatment to reduce symptoms; heterogeneous disease with obvious apical target areas.

The LVRS or bullectomy was performed unilaterally using lateral thoracotomy or bilaterally via median sternotomy. Video assisted thoroscopic surgery (VATS) procedure was used for either bilateral or unilateral procedures.

### Bullectomy for symptomatic or complicated giant lung bullae [^116WksuU]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Giant bullae of the lung are rare. Little is known about functional results after surgical treatment.

Methods

This study retrospectively reviewed all patients who underwent surgical treatment for giant bullae between December 1988 and December 2010.

Results

There were 63 patients (51 men, 12 women) with a median age of 56 years (range, 26 to 85 years). Bullae were a median size of 14 cm (range, 9 to 30 cm). Forty-five patients (71%) had underlying diffuse emphysema. The indication for surgical intervention was symptoms alone in 30 patients (48%) and associated complications in 33 (52%). The operation was a bullectomy in 54 patients, lobectomy in 6, plication in 2, and bilobectomy in 1. Complications occurred in 27 patients (43%), and 2 patients (3.0%) died. At the last follow-up, 19 had died and 44 were alive. Of the 43 patients with shortness of breath preoperatively, 29 (67.4%) were improved. Thirty patients (46.1%) had preoperative and postoperative pulmonary function tests with improvement from a median forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV₁) of 1.0 L preoperatively to 1.4 L postoperatively (p = 0.002). Increasing bulla size (p = 0.02) and underlying emphysema (p = 0.01) were adversely associated with postoperative morbidity. Dyspnea improved in 21 of 33 patients (64%) with underlying diffuse emphysema compared with 5 of 7 patients (71%) without emphysema (p = 0.70).

Conclusions

Bullectomy improved pulmonary function in most patients with a symptomatic or complicated giant bulla, or both. However, increasing bulla size and underlying emphysema resulted in increased treatment morbidity. Underlying diffuse emphysema is not a contraindication to bullectomy.

### Surgical treatment of bilateral vanishing lung syndrome: a case report [^115P85vM]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) can present as bullous emphysema, which can lead to the formation of giant bullae. Though this is a rare phenomenon, giant emphysematous bullae, characteristic of "vanishing lung syndrome", can lead to formation of several giant air pockets, naturally expanding, displacing a significant amount of already compromised lung tissue. This leads to saturation related complications, as well as higher risk of infection and rupturing. Vanishing lung syndrome usually presents as one or several giant emphysematous bullae, and is often accompanied by other lung tissue pathology, including smaller bullae and constrictive pathology. Rupturing of emphysematous type II bullae leads to spontaneous pneumothorax, and is the most frequent indication for emergency thoracic surgery in patients with COPD. Giant bullae should be treated surgically. A large resection bullectomy a spontaneous pneumothorax can be caused by barotrauma due to lung ventilation or insufficient volume of primary lung resection when large bullae were located close to the resection line. This requires thorough preoperative planning to account for possible complications. We present a clinical case of surgical treatment of bilateral giant bullae in a patient with COPD, written according to CARE case report guidelines. The treatment was complicated by a spontaneous pneumothorax due to an undiagnosed bulla underlying the giant emphysematous bulla. Urgent surgical treatment allowed for correction and stabilization of the patient.

### Surgical treatment of bilateral vanishing lung syndrome: a case report [^116o66Mq]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The formation of rapidly progressing riant emphysematous bullae is often associated with COPD progression, and if combined with a FEV₁ decrease to less than 25%, may be an indication for lung transplantation. Significant progressive reduction of spirometry indications and reduced exercise tolerance accompanied with dyspnea are characteristic to patients with vanishing lung syndrome (VLS). Surgical treatment is possible and effectively reduces dyspneic symptoms and significantly lowers the risk of spontaneous pneumothorax in patients with VLS. Despite the associated risks of bulla recurrence, VATS bullectomy significantly improves patient respiratory function and reduces risks of serious complications associated with giant emphysematous bullae. Our case reports shows, that within a 5 year follow-up period it is possible that no recurrence of giant bullae manifests, which underlines the efficacy of surgical treatment of patients with VLS.

VLS in patients with COPD is complicated by significant reduction in healthy lung tissue, and is often accompanied by severe respiratory function morbidity. VATS giant bulla resection should be accompanied by proper pharmacological therapy and strict respiratory exercise regimen. Surgical excision of giant bullae significantly reduce the ratio of pleural cavity to lung volume, so we recommend gradual expansion with controlled pneumoperitoneum to reduce risk of postoperative complications and spontaneous pneumothorax.

In the presented case report, primarily a two-stage surgery was planned, but due to postoperative complications, urgent surgery and second stage surgery were performed 26 h after primary surgery. It is important to note, that a single stage bilateral bullectomy is recommended, with simultaneous controlled peritoneum and pleural drainage. This allows to reduce the adverse effects of lung volume reduction.

### Evidence of mycobacterial disease in COPD patients with lung volume reduction surgery; the importance of histological assessment of specimens: a cohort study [^113CgoZE]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Non-tuberculosis mycobacteria (NTM) are a group of widely distributed environmental mycobacteria (other than tuberculosis and leprosy). There are over 100 species with varying degrees of pathogenicity. Pulmonary disease is the most common manifestation and is commonly diagnosed using American Thoracic Society (ATS) guidelines. A diagnosis requires pulmonary symptoms, and nodular or cavitatory opacities on imaging, in addition to positive cultures from two or more separate sputum samples or one positive culture from tissue/bronchial lavage samples. The prevalence of NTM infection is increasing worldwide which may be due in part to increased exposure and numbers of susceptible patients.

NTM are opportunistic bacteria and are therefore more likely to cause disease when there are defects in local or systemic host immunity. Patients with pre-existing lung conditions, such as COPD, cystic fibrosis (CF) and bronchiectasis, are shown to have a higher association with NTM infection.

Lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS) and bullectomy are surgical procedures directed at COPD patients in whom optimal medical treatment has failed to reduce their symptoms. These procedures improve lung mechanics in heterogeneous emphysema by removing the areas of lung with the greatest destruction. These procedures provide a resected tissue specimen, which is routinely sent for histopathological analysis. We have previously reported the safety outcomes in this population. This study assessed the histology reports of patients undergoing LVRS and bullectomy for histological diagnoses in addition to emphysema, with a particular reference to evidence of mycobacterial infection.

### Thoracoscopic giant lung bullaectomy: our initial experience [^112ys9Wj]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Surgical intervention is the last resort for treating giant bullae because of the wide variety of factors that affect the postoperative course and make the decision to operate highly challenging. Preoperative assessment is critical for patients with symptomatic or complicated bullous emphysema. A CT of the chest can provide detailed information not only on location, size, and number of bullae, but also on adjacent pleural, mediastinal, and underlying pulmonary parenchima. It is vitally important to assess the patient's pulmonary function, including pulmonary ventilation volume-flow relationships, prior to embarking upon surgical intervention. Patients with ruptured bullous emphysema who sustain a persistent air leak are unfit to undergo this assessment, and other means, such as determining the dyspnea index, diffusion capacity of carbon monoxide, blood gas analysis, six-minute walking test, or pulmonary perfusion-ventilation radio-nucleotide scanning will need to be used. Despite the fact that these parameters are crucial to the selection of the most suitable surgical procedure, they are not performed generally due to the emergent nature of the surgery.

Several factors, such as a single giant bullae, a significantly compressed normal lung, and the absence of severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are suggested as important predictors of a good postoperative outcome. The development of VATS in the 1990s has changed the timing and indications of surgical intervention for GLB because of its minimally invasive nature and the level of effectiveness equivalent to that of open procedures.

The indications for bullectomy to prevent as well as to treat complications of bullae are well known, but there has been no compelling evidence to favor one surgical technique over another. The most common indications for bullectomy are the prevention of recurrence, the treatment of a non-resolving pneumothorax, and the improvement of dyspnea. The prevention of pneumothorax largely depends upon whether or not there is only a single GLB — which is associated with normal lung parenchyma — or if the GLB as a part of emphysematous lung disease. In such cases, bullectomy can also be accomplished by mechanical pleurodesis.

### Evidence of mycobacterial disease in COPD patients with lung volume reduction surgery; the importance of histological assessment of specimens: a cohort study [^116sLbo8]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

This is the first study, to our knowledge, using resected lung specimens from LVRS/bullectomy procedures to estimate the prevalence of concurrent clinically unexpected mycobacterial infection in patients with severe COPD. 11% of 126 patients (10% of 142 specimens) had histological evidence of mycobacterial infection (necrotising granuloma, with or without AFB). A small number of previous studies have likewise found evidence of a wide range of histopathological diagnoses in addition to emphysema in surgical specimens, including neoplastic nodules and interstitial fibrosis, however none of these studies have previously reported any evidence of mycobacterial disease on histology.

COPD and other chronic respiratory conditions have been shown to confer a high risk of NTM infection. One study, showed that patients, already diagnosed with NTM (according to the ATS criteria), were likely to also have COPD (odds ratio: 15.7). This study also showed there was longstanding COPD (i.e. they had COPD for more than 5 years before NTM diagnosis) in 42.8% of all NTM patients. Furthermore, inhaled steroid usage and dosage conferred an additional risk for NTM after adjustment for oral steroid use and comorbidities. A similar US study looked at diagnosed cases of NTM and found a high prevalence of co-morbid COPD in patients with NTM infection (28%). This present study differs by taking the opposite approach and providing an assessment of the prevalence of mycobacterial disease in a consecutive series of patients undergoing surgery for COPD, and importantly with no prior clinical indicators or suspicion of mycobacterial disease.

### Hospital readmissions for COPD: a retrospective longitudinal study [^117CfmQP]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Patient and hospital inclusion criteria

Analysis of COPD readmission rate was carried out for all patients who underwent an NHS COPD admission between 1 April 2006 and 31 March 2009 and who were aged ≥ 45 years at the time of that admission. Admission history prior to 1 April 2006 was not included in the analysis. The exclusion of younger patients was consistent with the criteria used in clinical trials of treatments for COPD. Younger patients may differ from older patients with COPD in their disease pathology and natural history. The majority of COPD patients are over 45 years. The cut off of 31 March 2009 for index cases was set so that any admissions in the subsequent year, up to and including 31 March 2010, of each patient so identified would be included in the data set.

NHS hospitals were identified by their provider codes and were included in the analysis if they had a record of ≥ 100 COPD patient admissions during the study period. This criterion was applied to allow a comparison of hospitals which had responsibility for emergency admissions whose medical care might have expected to include COPD. Hospitals specialising in operative procedures for COPD including bronchial stenting, bullectomy, lung volume reduction and transplantation were excluded. If two or more hospitals had merged during the study period, the admissions from each of the hospitals were combined. These mergers usually occurred between neighbouring hospitals. This meant that patients within the catchment areas of the two hospitals would have had a similar likelihood of being admitted to either hospital.

Statistical analysis

Descriptive analysis

Descriptive analysis of the index COPD admissions was undertaken. This included analysis of the proportion of patients admitted and discharged on a weekday, the proportion of patients admitted for < 1 day and a description of the LOS of the index COPD admissions. Weekday was defined as Monday to Friday, and weekend as Saturday or Sunday.

A comparison was made of the age, sex, and deprivation scores of patients readmitted with COPD within 1 year of the index COPD admission and those patients who were not readmitted within 1 year. The differences between the groups were analysed using the Chi-squared test and the independent samples t -test.

To examine the COPD readmission rate to hospital within 1 year of the index COPD admission, the proportion of patients readmitted on the same day, within 30 days, within 90 days, within 182 days and within 1 year among patients aged ≥ 45 years was calculated.

### Successful treatment of a giant emphysematous bulla by bronchoscopic placement of endobronchial valves [^1156Lokg]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

Surgical bullectomy is the treatment of choice for giant emphysematous bulla. We report a case of successful nonsurgical treatment with bronchoscopic placement of one-way endobronchial valves that are currently under investigation for the treatment of end-stage emphysema. In patients who are poor surgical candidates, this noninvasive bronchoscopic treatment may represent a valuable alternative.

### Elective surgery for giant bullous emphysema: a 5-year clinical and functional follow-up [^115bLXUR]. Chest (2005). Low credibility.

Background

So far, very few studies in the literature have reported data on the long-term follow-up of patients who have undergone surgery for giant bullous emphysema (GBE), and much still needs to be known on the late fate of these patients.

Aims

To evaluate patients who have undergone elective surgery due to GBE, early and late mortality following surgery, the early and late reappearance of bullae, and the early and late modifications of clinical and functional data.

Subjects and Methods

Forty-one consecutive patients (36 men; mean [± SD] age, 48.4 ± 14.8 years) who underwent elective surgery for GBE were enrolled in a prospective study, and were studied both before and after undergoing bullectomy for a 5-year-follow-up period. Analyses were performed on the whole population and on two subgroups of patients who were divided on the basis of the absence of underlying diffuse emphysema (group A; n = 23) or the presence of underlying diffuse emphysema (group B; n = 18).

Results

The early mortality rate was 7.3% (within the first year), and the late mortality rate was 4.9% (overall mortality rate at 5 years, 12.2%; mortality rate in group B, 27.8%). Bullae did not reappear and residual bullae did not become enlarged in any patients at the site of the bullectomy. During the follow-up, the dyspnea score was reduced significantly soon after bullectomy and up to the fourth year of follow-up; intrathoracic gas volume also was reduced significantly (average, 0.7 L). The same was true for the FEV₁ percent predicted and the FEV₁/vital capacity ratio, which kept increasing until the second year; then, from the third year of follow-up these values were reduced, yet remained above the prebullectomy values until the fifth year of follow-up. When considered separately, the patients in group B appeared to be the most impaired, clinically and functionally (eg, FEV₁ showed a similar significant increase up to the second year in both groups after surgery, while a different mean annual decrease was appreciable from the second to the fifth year of follow-up: group A, 25 mL/year; group B, 83 mL/year. Furthermore, patients in group B were the only ones who contributed to the mortality rate, on the whole showing a behavior similar to that of patients who had undergone lung volume reduction surgery.

Conclusions

In patients with GBE who were enrolled in the study prospectively and were investigated yearly during a 5-year-follow-up period, elective surgery appears to have been fairly safe, and allowed clinical and functional improvement for at least 5 years. Better results may be expected in patients without underlying diffuse emphysema.

### Lung cancer in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: enhancing surgical options and outcomes [^114hWDpa]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are at increased risk for both the development of primary lung cancer, as well as poor outcome after lung cancer diagnosis and treatment. Because of existing impairments in lung function, patients with COPD often do not meet traditional criteria for tolerance of definitive surgical lung cancer therapy. Emerging information regarding the physiology of lung resection in COPD indicates that postoperative decrements in lung function may be less than anticipated by traditional prediction tools. In patients with COPD, more inclusive consideration for surgical resection with curative intent may be appropriate as limited surgical resections or nonsurgical therapeutic options provide inferior survival. Furthermore, optimizing perioperative COPD medical care according to clinical practice guidelines including smoking cessation can potentially minimize morbidity and improve functional status in this often severely impaired patient population.

### Results of surgery for chronic pulmonary aspergillosis, optimal antifungal therapy and proposed high risk factors for recurrence – a national centre's experience [^111ycF1Q]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Surgery for pulmonary aspergillosis is infrequent and often challenging. Risk assessment is imprecise and new antifungals may ameliorate some surgical risks. We evaluated the medical and surgical management of these patients, including perioperative and postoperative antifungal therapy.

Methods

Retrospective study of patients who underwent surgery for pulmonary aspergillosis between September 1996 and September 2011.

Results

30 patients underwent surgery with 23 having a preoperative tissue diagnosis while 7 were confirmed post-resection. The median age was 57 years (17–78). The commonest presenting symptoms were cough (40%, n = 12) and haemoptysis (43%, n = 13). Twelve (40%) patients had simple aspergilloma (including 2 with Aspergillus nodules) while the remaining 18 (60%) had chronic cavitary pulmonary aspergillosis (CCPA) (complex aspergilloma). Most of the patients had underlying lung disease: tuberculosis (20%, n = 6), asthma (26%, n = 8) and COPD (20%, n = 6). The procedures included lobectomy 50% (n = 15), pneumonectomy 10% (n = 3), sublobar resection 27% (n = 8), decortication 7% (n = 2), segmentectomy 3% (n = 1), thoracoplasty 3% (n = 1), bullectomy and pleurectomy 3% (n = 1), 6% (n = 2) lung transplantation for associated disease. Median hospital stay was 9.5 days (3–37). There was no operative and 30 day mortality. Main complications were prolonged air leak (n = 7, 23%), empyema (n = 6, 20%), respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy /reintubation (n = 4, 13%). Recurrence of CCPA was noted in 8 patients (26%), most having prior CCPA (75%). Taurolidine 2% was active against all 9 A. fumigatus isolates and used for pleural decontamination during surgery.

Conclusions

Surgery in patients with chronic pulmonary aspergillosis offered good outcomes with an acceptable morbidity in a difficult clinical situation; recurrence is problematic.

Description of levels of evidence — Evidence based on endpoints of well-designed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) provides consistent findings without important limitations. Evidence with limitations includes RCTs with limited numbers of patients, post hoc or subgroup analyses or meta-analyses, and also applies when few RCTs exist or important limitations are evident (e.g., methodological flaws, small numbers, short duration, populations differing from the target, or inconsistent results). Evidence from non-randomized designs derives from outcomes of uncontrolled or non-randomized trials or observational studies. When clinical literature is insufficient, guidance relies on panel consensus based on clinical experience or knowledge that does not meet the above stated criteria.

### An official American Thoracic Society / European Respiratory Society statement: research questions in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^115Q47qn]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Lung transplantation in COPD is the most common indication, accounting for 35% of lung transplants, and among patients with severe COPD it improves survival and health-related quality of life. Candidate selection uses prognostic indices including an FEV1 less than 20% predicted plus either a DLCO less than 20% or homogeneous emphysema on imaging, evidence of secondary pulmonary hypertension (or cor pulmonale) despite adequate oxygenation, and a history of hospitalization with acute hypercapnic respiratory failure with PaCO₂ greater than 50 mm Hg. A BODE score of 7 or more has been proposed as another indicator, though its applicability is unclear. Bilateral lung transplantation may be a better option than single lung transplantation, as it is associated with better long-term outcomes, at least among patients younger than 60 years; however, the advantages of bilateral over single lung transplantation are less clear if the risk of death while still on the waiting list is considered.

### Clinical practice guidelines for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a review and comparison of current resources [^1176u5nN]. Respiratory Care (2006). Low credibility.

The first clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) for the assessment and management of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were published 30 years ago. These and subsequent CPGs issued by professional societies and other groups prior to 2000 were consensus recommendations based on expert opinion and available studies, and they have been criticized for being inconsistent and not explicitly evidence-based. The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD), a joint project of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and the World Health Organization, released the first of a new generation of rigorous, evidence-based COPD guidelines in 2001. Since that time several other CPGs, notably those developed jointly by the American Thoracic Society (ATS) and the European Respiratory Society (ERS), and by the British National Collaborating Center for Chronic Conditions and Institute for Clinical Excellence, have also become available. While previous COPD guidelines had different severity-grading systems and differed in their therapy recommendations, the new CPGs are remarkably consistent and have very few areas of clinically relevant discrepancy. All are available free via the Internet, provide for regular revision and updating, and include materials for patients and the public, as well as for health-care providers. Although the GOLD and ATS-ERS guidelines both have international authorship and are intended for worldwide use, implementation of many of their recommendations (such as the requirement for spirometry in diagnosis and staging, an escalating management scheme that includes expensive inhaled medications and pulmonary rehabilitation, and consideration for lung-volume reduction surgery) remains beyond the reach of many patients and health care systems.

### Deciding what type of evidence and outcomes to include in guidelines: article 5 in integrating and coordinating efforts in COPD guideline development. An official ATS / ERS workshop report [^111fiaS5]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Professional societies, like many other organizations around the world, have recognized the need to use more rigorous processes to ensure that health care recommendations are informed by the best available research evidence. This is the fifth of a series of 14 articles that were prepared by an international panel to advise guideline developers in respiratory and other diseases on approaches for guideline development. This article focuses on what type of evidence and outcomes to include in guidelines.

Methods

In this review we addressed the following topics and questions. (1) What methods should be used to select important outcomes? (2) What types of outcomes should be considered? (3) What sources of evidence should be considered? (4) How should the importance of outcomes be ranked? (5) How to deal with surrogate outcomes. (6) What issues related to outcomes should be considered in the evidence review? (7) What quality of evidence should be used? (8) How to interpret the effect on outcomes. (9) How to incorporate outcomes related to harm. We based our responses on a PubMed literature review, prior reviews, relevant methodological research, and workshop discussions.

Results and Discussion

Guideline panels should use transparent and systematic methods to select both the evidence and important outcomes, with input from groups that represent a wide range of expertise and constituencies. Outcomes should address both benefits and downsides, with consideration of the definitions, severity, and time course of the outcomes. Guideline panels should use a transparent approach to rank outcome importance recognizing that stakeholder and patient values and preferences may vary. Intermediate and surrogate outcomes are frequently reported, but their correlation with patient important outcomes may be low. A guideline panel should determine a priori the magnitude of effect judged clinically significant, factors that may influence outcome reporting, and whether different ways of measuring the outcomes permit the outcomes to be combined. Comprehensive identification of the evidence includes the use of multiple data sources. While randomized controlled trials (RCTs) provide the highest quality evidence, reviewers of evidence also need to consider nonrandomized studies such as case series, registries, and case-control studies if randomized trials are not available. This is particularly true for harms. The outcomes reported from RCTs may not always directly apply to clinical practice settings (i.e., they may not be generalizable).

### Synthesis, grading, and presentation of evidence in guidelines: article 7 in integrating and coordinating efforts in COPD guideline development. An official ATS / ERS workshop report [^116pEEd6]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Professional societies, like many other organizations around the world, have recognized the need to use more rigorous processes to ensure that health care recommendations are informed by the best available research evidence. This is the seventh of a series of 14 articles that were prepared to advise guideline developers in respiratory and other diseases on approaches for guideline development. This article focuses on synthesizing, rating, and presenting evidence in guidelines.

Methods

In this review we addressed the following questions. (1) What evidence should guideline panels use to inform their recommendations? (2) How should they rate the quality of the evidence they use? (3) How should they grade evidence regarding diagnostic tests? (4) What should they do when quality of evidence differs across outcomes? (5) How should they present the evidence in a guideline? We did not conduct systematic reviews ourselves. We relied on prior evaluations of electronic databases and systematic reviews suggesting that the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation Working Group (GRADE) approach includes the desired features of a system for grading quality of evidence, including provision of models for presenting evidence for guideline panels, and for the consumers of practice guidelines. This article describes the GRADE approach to grading the quality of evidence and presenting evidence. Available evidence, the practice of leading guideline developers, and workshop discussions provide the basis for our conclusions.

Results and Discussion

GRADE rates the quality of evidence for each outcome across studies rather than for each study. In the GRADE approach randomized trials start as high-quality evidence and observational studies as low-quality evidence, but both can be rated down or up. Five factors may lead to rating down the quality of evidence: study limitations or risk of bias, inconsistency of results, indirectness of evidence, imprecision, and publication bias. Three factors may lead to rating up the quality of evidence from observational studies: large magnitude of effect, dose-response gradient, and situations in which all plausible confounders would decrease an apparent treatment effect, or would create a spurious effect when results suggest no effect. GRADE suggests use of evidence profiles that provide a comprehensive way to display the key evidence relevant to a clinical question. Guideline developers who follow this structure will find the transparency of their recommendations markedly enhanced.

### Moving from evidence to developing recommendations in guidelines: article 11 in integrating and coordinating efforts in COPD guideline development. An official ATS / ERS workshop report [^114vSrT7]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Professional societies, like many other organizations around the world, have recognized the need to use more rigorous processes to ensure that healthcare recommendations are informed by the best available research evidence. This is the 11th of a series of 14 articles that methodologists and researchers from around the world prepared to advise guideline developers for respiratory and other diseases on how to achieve this goal. For this article, we developed five key questions and updated a review of the literature on moving from evidence to recommendations.

Methods

We addressed the following specific questions. What is the strength of a recommendation and what determines the strength? What are the implications of strong and weak recommendations for patients, clinicians, and policy makers? Should guideline panels make recommendations in the face of very low-quality evidence? Under which circumstances should guideline panels make research recommendations? How should recommendations be formulated and presented? We searched PubMed and other databases of methodological studies for existing systematic reviews and relevant methodological research. We did not conduct systematic reviews ourselves. Our conclusions are based on available evidence, consideration of what guideline developers are doing, and pre- and postworkshop discussions.

Results and Discussion

The strength of a recommendation reflects the extent to which guideline developers can, across the range of patients for whom the recommendations are intended, be confident that the desirable effects of following the recommendation outweigh the undesirable effects. Four factors influence the strength of a recommendation: the quality of evidence supporting the recommendation, the balance between desirable and undesirable effects, the uncertainty or variability of patient values and preferences, and costs. Strong and weak (also called "conditional") recommendations have distinct implications for patients, clinicians, and policy makers. Adherence to strong recommendations or, in the case of weak (conditional) recommendations, documentation of discussion or shared decision making with a patient, might be used as quality measures or performance indicators. Clinicians desire guidance regardless of the quality of the underlying evidence. Very low-quality evidence should ideally result in either appropriately labeled recommendations (i.e., as based on very low-quality evidence) or a statement that the guideline panel did not reach consensus on the recommendation due to the lack of confidence in the effect estimates. However, guideline panels often have more resources, time, and information than practicing clinicians. Therefore, they may be in a position to use their best judgments to make recommendations even when there is very low-quality evidence, although some guideline developers disagree with this approach and prefer a general approach of not making recommendations in the face of very low-quality evidence. Guideline panels should consider making research recommendations when there is important uncertainty about the desirable and undesirable effects of an intervention, further research could reduce that uncertainty, and the potential benefits and savings of reducing the uncertainty outweigh the potential harms of not making the research recommendation. Recommendations for additional research should be as precise and specific as possible.

Developing evidence-based recommendations — grading approach: The Work Group used "a modified GRADE and USPSTF methodology", and, per GRADE, "each recommendation's strength and direction is determined by the following four domains". For the domain Confidence in the quality of the evidence, "The options for this domain include: High, Moderate, Low, or Very low", and "the lowest quality of evidence for any of the critical outcomes determines the overall quality of the evidence for a recommendation". Recommendation strength "generally aligns with the confidence", where "Strong recommendations are typically supported by High or Moderate quality evidence", yet "GRADE permits Low or Very low quality evidence to support a Strong recommendation in certain instances (e.g., life-threatening situation)". The domain "Balance of Desirable and Undesirable Outcomes" "refers to the relative magnitudes or tradeoffs of anticipated benefits".

### Attitudes and access to lung volume reduction surgery for COPD: a survey by the British thoracic society [^114FgK2U]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2014). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major cause of disability and mortality in the UK and is now the third most frequent cause of death worldwideas a consequence of the ongoing epidemic of tobacco addiction. The pathological processes involved, destruction of small airways and lung parenchyma as well as narrowing of larger airways, are poorly responsive to medical therapies and many patients remain severely disabled despite optimum medical therapy. Only a handful of treatments including smoking cessation, long-term oxygen therapy in selected patients and lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS) have been shown to improve prognosis.

LVRS was described as a palliative treatment for emphysema by Brantigan and Muller in 1957. The aim of LVRS is to resect the most emphysematous portion of the lung. This allows healthier, less compliant areas to be ventilated more effectively, reduces operating lung volumes and thus improves chest wall and respiratory muscle mechanics. In the US National Emphysema Treatment Trial (NETT), patients with an upper lobe predominant pattern of emphysema and a low preoperative exercise capacity gained the maximum benefit and had increased survival, which long-term economic analysis suggests is achieved at an acceptable cost per quality-adjusted life year. The NETT study also identified a group of patients with an excess risk of surgical mortality: those with a forced expiratory volume 1 s (FEV₁) < 20% predicted and either homogeneous disease or a carbon monoxide transfer factor < 20% predicted. The mortality rate for patients excluding this high-risk group was 5.2% at 90 days. In the NETT trial, complications included major respiratory or cardiac complication in 29.8% and 20% of patients, respectively. At 1 month, 28.1% of patients were still hospitalised or in a long-term care facility. However, audit of current practice suggests that mortality and morbidity are significantly lower.

Data from the UK Society of Cardiothoracic Surgery (SCTS) register, show that only 96 procedures in 2009–2010 and 90 in 2010–2011 were recorded. The likely pool of eligible patients is significantly larger than thisand there is therefore concern that patients who may benefit are not being considered for treatment. Some authors have suggested that physicians are deterred from referral as LVRS is perceived as too complicated with limited patient benefit and a substantial risk of complications. To improve understanding of the obstacles limiting provision of LVRS to suitable patients with COPD, we undertook a survey of members of the British Thoracic Society (BTS).

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^115a465W]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease perioperative management — Risk of postoperative pulmonary complications in COPD may vary with severity, and the surgical site is the most important predictor with risk increasing as the incision approaches the diaphragm. Most reports conclude that epidural or spinal anesthesia have a lower risk than general anesthesia. Acute exacerbation rates as high as 8.4% have been reported after sham bronchoscopic procedures, and these data suggest that intubation and/or simple airway manipulation may increase the risk of exacerbation in select COPD patients. To prevent postoperative pulmonary complications, stable COPD patients clinically symptomatic and/or with limited exercise capacity should be treated medically intensively before surgery, and the presence of comorbid conditions, especially cardiac abnormalities, should be systemically assessed and treated before any major surgical intervention.

### Identifying target audiences: who are the guidelines for? article 1 in integrating and coordinating efforts in COPD guideline development. An official ATS / ERS workshop report [^112Cfyks]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Professional societies, like many other organizations around the world, have recognized the need to use rigorous processes to ensure that health care recommendations are informed by the best available research evidence. Different clinical practice guidelines addressing the management of the same disease may vary widely in the evidence used and the format of the recommendations, with the result that not all are appropriate for all audiences. This is the first of a series of 14 articles that clinicians, methodologists, and researchers from around the world prepared to advise those developing guidelines in respiratory and other diseases about the potential impact of identifying the target audiences for their clinical practice guidelines.

Methods

In this review we address the following questions. (1) Which audiences are interested in a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) guideline? (2) How many audiences can be addressed in a single COPD guideline? (3) What is the purpose of the guidelines? (4) Who should be included on the guideline panel? We collected information by searching PubMed and reviewing information from groups that are currently making and using respiratory disease guidelines, as well as from workshop discussions. Our conclusions are based on available evidence, consideration of what guideline developers are doing, and the opinions of those who attended the workshop.

Results and Conclusions

Clinicians desire COPD and other guidelines that are concise, use evidence from practices similar to theirs, and whose authors have expertise in providing care in similar settings and with similar patients. In the case of COPD, barriers to generalists' use of guidelines include lack of awareness of the guidelines, failure to embrace the diagnostic methods as capable of providing definitive confirmation of COPD, and, most importantly, failure of previous guidelines to address the treatment of COPD in the context of the broad range of multiple morbidities that affect most people with COPD. COPD specialists may require guidelines with more details regarding complex COPD management. The purpose of the guidelines may determine the appropriate audience. Guidelines developed to improve care by enhancing education may have a very different audience than guidelines designed to improve care by limiting the scope of practice, punishing noncompliance, or saving money. The purpose will drive dissemination and implementation strategies, but should not influence the methods used to develop a guideline. Clinicians desire guidelines, but data suggest that the current development systems, content, format, and dissemination strategies may need to be altered to fit these audiences. After the purpose and audience are determined, the guideline committee must decide how to fairly address these audiences, which will usually require seeking their input.

### Reporting and publishing guidelines: article 12 in integrating and coordinating efforts in COPD guideline development. An official ATS / ERS workshop report [^116YKu3e]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Professional societies, like many other organizations around the world, have recognized the need to use rigorous processes to ensure that health care recommendations are informed by the best available research evidence. This is the twelfth of a series of 14 articles that were prepared to advise guideline developers in respiratory and other diseases. This article discusses the reporting and publishing of guidelines.

Methods

The authors formulated and discussed the following questions on the reporting and publishing of guidelines. (1) What should be reported in guidelines? (2) How should guidelines be written? (3) How should the bottom-line message be conveyed? (4) How should guidelines be packaged? (5) Where should guidelines be published? (6) Who benefits from the publication of guidelines? (7) What information should be vetted by the editor(s)? (8) How should guidelines be peer reviewed? We conducted a review of the literature, looking for systematic reviews and methodological research that addressed these questions, but we did not conduct a full systematic review. Our conclusions are based on the available evidence from the published literature and logical arguments from experienced guideline developers.

Results and Discussion

There is little empirical evidence that addresses the reporting and publishing of guidelines. A standard format for reporting guidelines is desirable to ensure that guidelines are comprehensive and that all of the information necessary to judge their quality is presented. In addition, guidelines should contain concise evidence-based recommendations. To facilitate the use of guidelines by consumers, it is preferable to publish them in journals that serve the target audience and to package them in multiple ways. Editors and peer reviewers should ensure that reporting standards have been met, potential conflicts of interest have been adequately addressed and made public, and that the recommendations address important clinical questions.

### An official American Thoracic Society / European Respiratory Society statement: research questions in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^111vhK2p]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society research statement on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease outlines that the goal is to describe evidence related to diagnosis, assessment, and management; identify gaps in knowledge; and make recommendations for future research, and it is not intended to provide clinical practice recommendations on COPD diagnosis and management. Methods state that clinicians, researchers, and patient advocates with expertise in COPD were invited to participate; a literature search of Medline was performed; the search was not a systematic review of the evidence; and existing evidence was appraised and summarized, and then salient knowledge gaps were identified. Recommendations for research that addresses important gaps in the evidence in all areas of COPD were formulated via discussion and consensus. The introduction summarizes disease burden, noting Global Burden of Disease estimates that COPD is the third leading cause of death worldwide and in the United States, caused more than 3 million deaths in 2010 alone, is the second leading cause of disability-adjusted life-years lost, that COPD-related mortality more than doubled among women over a 20-year observation period, and that exacerbations account for 50 to 75% of the cost associated with COPD.

### Smad gene expression in pulmonary fibroblasts: indications for defective ECM repair in COPD [^117FkmeD]. Respiratory Research (2008). Low credibility.

Tissue of GOLD stage IV COPD patients (median FEV₁ 19% of predicted) was obtained from COPD patients undergoing surgery for lung transplantation or lung volume reduction. All individuals had quitted smoking for at least 1 year before surgery. The resected tissue showed both macroscopically and microscopically severe emphysematous lesions, often accompanied by bullae. Sub-pleural fibrous areas were avoided.

Tissue of the control group (median FEV₁ 86% of predicted) was derived from non-involved lung tissue from patients undergoing resective surgery for pulmonary carcinoma. Patients had no airway obstruction, nor chronic airway symptoms like cough and sputum production. Material was always taken as far as possible from the tumor, or from a non-involved lobe. No histopathological abnormalities were present.

### Incorporating coexisting chronic illness into decisions about patient selection for lung cancer screening. An official American Thoracic Society research statement [^116aZVfm]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) and perioperative risk in advanced chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) — although decreasing FEV1 and DLCO predict worse postoperative outcomes after thoracotomy, this effect is markedly diminished for resections performed via VATS; perioperative mortality in advanced COPD is lower after VATS lobectomy than after thoracotomy (1.5–2.9% vs. 3.5–7.8%, respectively); yet in U.S. population databases, only 30–40% of lobectomies are performed via VATS, only 50% of lobectomies in the United States are performed by dedicated cardiothoracic surgeons, and only 60% of lobectomies performed by cardiothoracic surgeons are via VATS; thus, the issue of how the risk of perioperative mortality should factor into a decision whether to screen a patient with pulmonary compromise is complicated and is linked not only to the degree of compromise but also to the type of resection and where the resection may be performed.

Results

Demographics

We identified 18 patients who had undergone an OWT. Their demographics are outlined in Table 1. Patients ranged in age from 31 to 79. Nine patients (50%) had a history significant for smoking. All but 3 patients had significant pre-existing comorbidities as graded by the CCI, an estimate of 10-year survival based on individual comorbidities at the time of the index operation. Two of the 3 patients without pre-existing comorbidities as measured by the CCI had a post-traumatic cause of empyema (one occurring in an otherwise healthy 47-year-old male after a gun-shot wound to the chest and the other in a 31-year-old male with cerebral palsy after a gastrostomy-tube was inadvertently tunneled into the pleural space). Of the patients without comorbidities tabulated by CCI, 2 of 3 did not require readmission after their index operation other than for scheduled delayed closure, and they are both still living. The third patient with underlying cerebral palsy died secondary to complications. The most common comorbidities among our patient population were metastatic cancer (n = 7) and hypertension/coronary artery disease, which is not factored into CCI (n = 7). Another common comorbidity was COPD or reactive airway disease (n = 4).

Abbreviations: AIDS acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, BPF bronchopleural fistula, CAD coronary artery disease, COPD chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, CVA cerebrovascular accident, HIV human immunodeficiency virus, HTN hypertension, M mean, OWT open window thoracotomy, SD standard deviation

Operative details

Operative details of the procedures are listed in Table 2. The most common indication for OWT was a post-resectional BPF (50% with n = 4 post-lobectomy and n = 5 post-pneumonectomy). In the majority of post-resectional BPF patient population (n = 6), presence of empyema meant less invasive surgical options for stump closure such as stump revision or filling post-resectional dead space with muscle or omentum given extent of contamination were not feasible. In one patient who suffered from a bronchial stump fistula after a right upper lobectomy, however, an endobronchial stent was trialed to protect the remaining lung from spillage while allowing time for the BPF to heal. Given a persistent loculated apical cavity in the setting of mycobacterium avium-intracellulare infection, an OWT was ultimately performed.

### Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease guidelines in Europe: a look into the future [^114zLSNk]. Respiratory Research (2018). Low credibility.

A standardised pan-European guideline; is this realistic?

Duplicate efforts are made across Europe, with individual countries investing significant resources into the development of CPGs. Institutional collaboration and consolidation of efforts may significantly reduce the cumbersome nature of guideline development and frequent updates. Furthermore, variations in individual sets of guidelines will inevitably continue unless collaboration is encouraged and optimised between countries. These variations, however minor, have the potential to mislead or confuse practicing healthcare professionals.

Most national guidelines in Europe have been influenced to varying extents by GOLD. Moreover, GOLD 2017 will likely impact future revisions of European national guidelines in a move towards more personalised treatment of COPD. The GOLD strategy also carries a major positive advantage in that the document is updated annually with the most recent and relevant literature and studies; however, no formal evaluation of evidence (i.e. GRADE or similar) is performed. In addition, since by its definition, GOLD aims to provide a global strategy document, some recommendations may not be directly (i.e. without any adaptation) applicable in some areas or contexts. As most countries do not have the resources to facilitate an annual update to their national guidelines, each country has the opportunity to adopt specific sections of GOLD that are locally relevant. Such processes could be facilitated by tighter collaboration between GOLD committees and regional, national or local initiatives.

Owing to the importance of national guidelines, coupled with the international availability of the GOLD 2017 document, there may be potential for the development of an intermediary document between the two. This could comprise a single detailed "umbrella" evidence base supporting common principles but with an adaptation of recommendations to reflect local practices. Individual sensitivities could therefore be facilitated within this common adaptable template. National reimbursement policies, availability of resources and/or regulatory legislation may cause guideline recommendation and prescription deviations between countries. In brief, first-line treatment recommendations (at the class level) and secondary recommendations could be included within the common guideline, with local alternative suggestions added at a local level in line with local policy and scientific societies.

To support the introduction and implementation of a common, adaptable European guideline, a pan-European guideline development resource repository could be compiled as a support tool. Moreover, different sections of a guideline dedicated to a specific healthcare practitioner role may boost implementation across clinical practice.

### An official American Thoracic Society / European Respiratory Society statement: research questions in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^114pB84m]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease outcomes and recommendations — Outcomes are the results of an intervention, and the relationship between many surrogate outcomes and outcomes that matter to patients is described as modest at best, with interventions that improve surrogate outcomes frequently not affecting patient-centered outcomes; as a result, there is increasing emphasis on using patient-centered outcomes in clinical research and on finding high-quality surrogate outcomes that reliably predict patient-centered outcomes. We recommend: Studies that determine which outcomes matter most to patients with COPD and, therefore, are truly patient-centered outcomes in this population. We recommend: Studies that correlate physiological and anatomical outcomes with patient-centered outcomes, to identify high-quality surrogate outcomes that may be used in future research.

### Pulmonary rehabilitation for adults with chronic respiratory disease: an official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^115kZ16X]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Question 1) background — burden, symptoms, and unmet need: Approximately 11.7% of people worldwide have COPD, and in the United States approximately 16 million have diagnosed COPD with likely millions more undiagnosed. Dyspnea and reduced exercise capacity are cardinal features and relate to respiratory structural and functional changes, skeletal muscle dysfunction, deconditioning, cardiocirculatory limitations, and other comorbid conditions. Acute exacerbations further worsen lung function, symptoms, and disability and increase patients' mortality risk, collectively impairing HRQoL. People with COPD typically remain symptomatic despite existing pharmacotherapies; additional treatments are therefore needed to improve patients' outcomes.

### An official American Thoracic Society / European Respiratory Society statement: research questions in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^113UxR2y]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a leading cause of morbidity, mortality, and resource use worldwide. The goal of this Official American Thoracic Society (ATS)/European Respiratory Society (ERS) Research Statement is to describe evidence related to diagnosis, assessment, and management; identify gaps in knowledge; and make recommendations for future research. It is not intended to provide clinical practice recommendations on COPD diagnosis and management.

Methods

Clinicians, researchers, and patient advocates with expertise in COPD were invited to participate. A literature search of Medline was performed, and studies deemed relevant were selected. The search was not a systematic review of the evidence. Existing evidence was appraised and summarized, and then salient knowledge gaps were identified.

Results

Recommendations for research that addresses important gaps in the evidence in all areas of COPD were formulated via discussion and consensus.

Conclusions

Great strides have been made in the diagnosis, assessment, and management of COPD as well as understanding its pathogenesis. Despite this, many important questions remain unanswered. This ATS/ERS Research Statement highlights the types of research that leading clinicians, researchers, and patient advocates believe will have the greatest impact on patient-centered outcomes.

### A guide to guidelines for professional societies and other developers of recommendations: introduction to integrating and coordinating efforts in COPD guideline development. An official ATS / ERS workshop report [^111Nk6vQ]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2012). Low credibility.

Organizations around the world are recognizing that guidelines should be based on the best available evidence, that the development of recommendations needs to be transparent, and that appropriate processes should be followed. In June 2007, we convened an American Thoracic Society (ATS)/European Respiratory Society (ERS)-sponsored workshop with over 60 representatives from 36 international organizations to provide advice to guideline developers about the required steps and processes for guideline development using the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) as an example. Following the workshop, participants completed a series of 14 review articles that underwent peer review and incorporated key new literature until June 2011 for most articles in this series. The review articles evaluate the guideline cycle including: priority setting, question formulation, managing conflict of interest, defining appropriate outcomes, stakeholder involvement, grading the quality of evidence and strength of recommendations, integration of values and preferences, considering resource use, reporting of guidelines, implementation, and adaptation. In this Introduction we frame the background and methods of these reviews and provide the key conclusions of the workshop. A summary of the workshop's conclusions and recommendations was published in The Lancet. Given the enormous resources that are spent on research and the importance of providing the best guidance to healthcare decision makers, attributing appropriate funds to research syntheses and transparent, independent guidance for the development of evidence-based guidelines is justified. Furthermore, given the immense amount of work that is required, individuals and organizations need to collaborate to achieve the best possible and cost-effective coordination of these efforts.

Stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) — maintenance inhaled therapy to prevent acute exacerbations: For patients with stable COPD, "we recommend inhaled long-acting anticholinergic/long-acting β2-agonist therapy or inhaled long-acting anticholinergic monotherapy, since both are effective to prevent acute exacerbations of COPD (Grade 1C)". For patients with stable COPD, "we recommend maintenance combination of inhaled corticosteroid/long-acting β2-agonist therapy or inhaled long-acting anticholinergic monotherapy, since both are effective to prevent acute exacerbations of COPD (Grade 1C)". For patients with stable COPD, "we suggest maintenance combination of inhaled long-acting anticholinergic/corticosteroid/long-acting β2-agonist therapy or inhaled long-acting anticholinergic monotherapy, since both are effective to prevent acute exacerbations of COPD (Grade 2C)". Underlying values place "high value on reducing the risk of acute exacerbations of COPD", and also state, "This recommendation does not support the use of inhaled corticosteroid monotherapy in COPD".

Manuscript Preparation

After the generation of recommendations, the panel divided up into working groups for manuscript preparation. For each PICO question, we summarized the recommendation, provided a narrative summary of the evidence (highlighting the largest and most relevant clinical trials for each PICO question), discussed issues raised as part of the EtD framework, and provided a justification for the final recommendation considering the above, together with implementation considerations and future research directions. Each PICO summary was reviewed by the individual working group and then synthesized by the chairs and methodologists.

Editing and feedback on the manuscript were conducted electronically and were coordinated by the panel chairs. The final wording of all recommendations and justifications was agreed on by the entire panel and submitted to ATS for review and approval. The guideline underwent anonymous peer review by content experts and a methodologist. After multiple cycles of review and revision, the guideline was reviewed and approved by a multidisciplinary board of directors.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) — cardio-selective beta-blockers and cardiovascular (CV) indications: The Work Group characterized this as a Reviewed, Amended recommendation, with confidence in the quality of the evidence very low and the body of evidence limited to two RCTs with relatively small sample sizes. They considered that the harms of using cardio-selective beta-blockers in patients with COPD and hypertension without any other CV requirements outweigh the benefits. In patients with a CV indication, beta-blocker use was associated with decreased COPD exacerbations and mortality, without an increase in adverse events, whereas without a CV indication beta-blockers are associated with a higher risk of exacerbations and hospitalizations. There was limited evidence in COPD with overlapping asthma, and the Work Group decided upon a Weak for recommendation.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease comorbidity management — patients with COPD and multiple chronic comorbidities are generally treated according to existing standards for each disease, and observational studies suggest mortality can be reduced by nonrespiratory treatments including β-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and statins. We recommend: Studies that evaluate the effects of treating COPD on the outcomes of comorbid diseases as well as studies that evaluate the effect of treating comorbid diseases on COPD-related outcomes.

GRADE methodology — link between evidence quality and recommendation strength is described: The CPG's use of GRADE reflects a more rigorous application of the methodology, and the determination of the strength of the recommendation is more directly linked to the confidence in the quality of the evidence on outcomes that are critical to clinical decision-making. Topics for which it may be inherently more difficult to design and conduct rigorous studies are typically supported by lower quality evidence and, in turn, Weak recommendations, whereas topics for which rigorous studies can be designed and conducted may more often be Strong recommendations. Per GRADE, if the quality of evidence differs across the relevant critical outcomes, the lowest quality of evidence for any of the critical outcomes determines the overall quality of the evidence for a recommendation.
