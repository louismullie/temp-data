## Question

Eye infection

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about evaluating and managing an eye infection. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the initial triage and red flags that mandate urgent ophthalmology referral. Then, I should verify how to distinguish infectious from noninfectious causes and how to differentiate viral, bacterial, allergic, and other etiologies. Next, I will review when and how to use diagnostic testing. After that, I need to outline management by etiology, including antibiotic stewardship and delayed prescribing. Finally, I should confirm follow-up, prevention, and special populations such as neonates, contact lens wearers, and immunocompromised patients, making sure each step aligns with current guidelines and high-quality evidence.

> Let me first confirm the red flags that require immediate ophthalmology referral, because missing these risks vision loss. Severe pain, photophobia with pupillary constriction, decreased visual acuity, anisocoria, corneal involvement, hypopyon, or a vesicular rash on the eyelids or nose should trigger urgent referral, as should suspected herpetic disease, immunocompromise, recent ocular surgery, or a hyperacute presentation with copious purulent discharge and marked chemosis suggesting gonococcus or meningococcus, which can rapidly progress to corneal melt and perforation [^1128PMbG] [^113ttBcu] [^114Xxkdx].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about etiology before a careful history and exam. I need to check for unilateral versus bilateral disease, discharge character, itch, URI symptoms, contact lens use, recent ocular procedures, trauma, sexual exposures, and immunocompromise, and I should examine visual acuity, lids, conjunctiva, cornea with fluorescein, and anterior chamber, because no single sign reliably separates viral from bacterial conjunctivitis and misclassification is common [^116ZAFRG] [^112ByJSW] [^114ZswsT].

> Let me consider the epidemiology to refine pretest probabilities. In adults, most acute conjunctivitis is viral, whereas in children bacterial disease predominates, which helps calibrate expectations before testing or treatment decisions, but I should double-check that I am not overgeneralizing in atypical presentations [^112ByJSW] [^114ZswsT].

> Next, I should review the clinical features that shift likelihood toward viral versus bacterial disease, while remembering these are probabilistic, not definitive. Features favoring viral include watery discharge, concomitant pharyngitis, preauricular lymphadenopathy, and contact with others with red eye, whereas mucopurulent discharge with eyelids matted on waking and concurrent otitis media favor bacterial; importantly, no single sign is pathognomonic, so I need to integrate the whole picture and avoid anchoring bias [^112ByJSW] [^114ZswsT].

> I will now examine the differential beyond viral and bacterial causes. Allergic conjunctivitis typically presents with intense bilateral itching and a history of atopy, HSV can produce unilateral disease with a dendritic epithelial defect, chlamydial disease is often chronic with follicles and may be associated with genital infection, and contact lens–related disease carries a higher risk of Pseudomonas keratitis, so I should confirm lens wear and corneal status carefully [^112Q6fN6] [^112Nyjhu].

> Wait, let me verify when diagnostic testing is warranted. Routine cultures are not needed for mild cases, but I should obtain cultures or PCR in neonates, immunocompromised patients, hyperacute cases, treatment failures, suspected chlamydia or gonorrhea, or when keratitis is suspected; in resource-limited settings, povidone-iodine 1.25% ophthalmic solution can be considered when antibiotics are unavailable [^117E7fSP] [^112ZYxCy] [^114DEtT2].

> For viral conjunctivitis, I need to ensure I do not over-treat. Management is supportive with artificial tears, cold compresses, and strict hygiene counseling, and I should advise minimizing contact with others for 10–14 days from onset in the last affected eye because adenovirus is highly contagious and can persist on surfaces; antibiotics should be avoided because they do not help and may cause harm, and I should confirm that patients understand these points to reduce transmission [^114ZswsT] [^116ReYNy] [^114zXC3p].

> For bacterial conjunctivitis, let me think about stewardship and timing. Mild disease in immunocompetent adults is often self-limited, and delayed prescribing reduces antibiotic use without worsening symptom control; if antibiotics are used, a 5–7 day course of a broad-spectrum topical agent is reasonable, with no evidence that one antibiotic class is superior, and chloramphenicol remains a suitable first-line option in many settings; in children, antibiotics modestly shorten symptom duration, so treatment is reasonable when disease is moderate or when return to school is a priority [^115WeUv1] [^113JyVu3] [^112ZYxCy] [^114nZNYs] [^1177nUqX].

> But wait, what if this is hyperacute bacterial conjunctivitis with profuse purulence and chemosis. I should treat this as a potential gonococcal or meningococcal infection and initiate urgent ophthalmology referral, obtain cultures, and start systemic therapy such as intramuscular ceftriaxone, adding topical fluoroquinolone while awaiting results, because these pathogens can cause rapid corneal destruction and systemic spread [^114Xxkdx] [^112Hw1t1].

> For chlamydial conjunctivitis, I need to ensure systemic therapy and partner management. Adults should receive oral azithromycin or doxycycline, infants require systemic erythromycin because more than half have infection elsewhere, and all sexual partners should be treated; I should also consider sexual abuse evaluation in children and arrange follow-up given nontrivial failure rates [^114DEtT2] [^112Q6fN6].

> For allergic conjunctivitis, I should confirm the presence of itching and atopy, then initiate topical antihistamines with mast cell–stabilizing activity, add cold compresses and lubricants, and reserve a short course of topical corticosteroids for severe flares only after ruling out HSV and ensuring close follow-up, given risks of steroid-induced complications [^114ZswsT] [^115scch9].

> For HSV conjunctivitis or keratitis, I need to check for dendritic epithelial defects and avoid steroids initially. Topical ganciclovir or trifluridine plus oral acyclovir or valacyclovir are appropriate, with early ophthalmology involvement, and I should arrange follow-up within a week to monitor for progression and toxicity, especially with trifluridine [^112RASn5] [^1113kw7x].

> For contact lens wearers with red eye, I should confirm lens removal and examine the cornea for infiltrates or ulcers. The threshold for urgent ophthalmology referral is lower because Pseudomonas keratitis risk is higher, and I should treat presumptively for bacterial keratitis with frequent topical antibiotics while arranging prompt specialist evaluation [^114Xxkdx] [^113TsmVu].

> Let me reconsider the role of topical corticosteroids in infectious conjunctivitis. Steroids can reduce inflammation but may prolong adenoviral infection, worsen HSV epithelial disease, and raise IOP; if considered, they should be used only with anti-infective coverage and close ophthalmic supervision for short courses, and I should double-check that HSV has been excluded before prescribing [^117JkdqQ] [^1112KZBq].

> Next, I should review prevention and public health measures. Hand hygiene is the cornerstone to limit transmission of viral and bacterial conjunctivitis, patients should avoid touching or rubbing the eyes, and those with adenoviral disease should minimize close contact for 10–14 days; in wilderness or resource-limited contexts, povidone-iodine 1.25% can be a reasonable alternative when antibiotics are unavailable [^113rDq7w] [^116ReYNy] [^112ZYxCy].

> I need to ensure appropriate follow-up and safety netting. Most cases resolve within 1–2 weeks, but patients should return if pain worsens, vision declines, a corneal opacity develops, or symptoms persist beyond two weeks; in children, I should maintain a lower threshold for evaluation given higher bacterial prevalence and potential complications [^114ZswsT] [^1138Wf4y].

> Finally, I should confirm documentation and patient education. I will record the working diagnosis, rationale for delayed prescribing if used, hygiene instructions, and return precautions, and I will explain that most conjunctivitis is self-limited, antibiotics offer modest benefit at best in bacterial disease, and misuse drives resistance, aligning with stewardship principles and patient-centered outcomes [^114aP5sv] [^1112KZBq].

Eye infections include **conjunctivitis** (viral, bacterial, allergic) [^114ZswsT], **keratitis** (corneal infection) [^115WDUig], and **endophthalmitis** (intraocular infection) [^113eify2]. Viral conjunctivitis is most common [^1138Wf4y], typically self-limited, and managed with supportive care [^114ZswsT]; bacterial conjunctivitis is treated with topical antibiotics [^115L23qK] to shorten duration and reduce transmission [^116E3SJr]. Keratitis and endophthalmitis are sight-threatening and require urgent ophthalmology referral and aggressive therapy [^115y7vo5] [^1123LgC4]. Red flags include pain, photophobia, vision loss, corneal opacity, or purulent discharge [^1128PMbG]; prompt evaluation is essential to prevent complications [^1123g5wo].

## Clinical presentation

Typical symptoms include **redness, discharge, itching, tearing, crusting, pain, photophobia, blurred vision, and foreign-body sensation** [^1154u44P] [^115y7vo5]. Red flags requiring urgent evaluation include **severe pain, vision loss, corneal opacity, purulent discharge, or symptoms persisting beyond 48 hours** [^115y7vo5] [^113ttBcu].

---

## Diagnostic methods

- **Clinical examination**: Slit-lamp, fluorescein staining, visual acuity [^114A3rZs].
- **Microbiological tests**: Cultures, PCR, smears for bacterial/fungal/viral identification [^113AxWjY].
- **Imaging**: Ultrasound, OCT for posterior segment involvement [^notfound].

---

## Treatment approaches

- **Supportive care**: Artificial tears, cold compresses, hygiene measures [^114ZswsT].
- **Topical antibiotics**: For bacterial conjunctivitis/keratitis (erythromycin, fluoroquinolones) [^115L23qK] [^114eswYs].
- **Antivirals**: Ganciclovir, trifluridine for HSV; systemic acyclovir for severe cases [^112RASn5].
- **Antifungals**: Natamycin, voriconazole for fungal keratitis [^notfound].
- **Intravitreal antibiotics**: For endophthalmitis (vancomycin, ceftazidime) [^1123LgC4].

---

## Potential complications

Complications include **corneal scarring, vision loss, endophthalmitis, chronic infection, and recurrence** [^113TsmVu] [^113YQDMX]. Early, appropriate treatment and close follow-up are critical to prevent these outcomes [^113TsmVu].

---

## Prevention strategies

Prevention relies on **hand hygiene** — frequent handwashing and avoiding eye rubbing [^113rDq7w] — and on **contact lens hygiene** — strict adherence to cleaning, storage, and replacement schedules [^116nH1Mj]. Avoiding irritants and allergens reduces allergic and irritant conjunctivitis, and public health measures such as education and outbreak control limit spread [^116ReYNy].

Scenario 2: Infective Conjunctivitis

Conjunctivitis, an inflammation or infection of the mucous membrane covering the anterior sclera and inside eyelid, has 2 infectious forms, viral and bacterial, as well as a noninfectious form induced by allergens. Acute conjunctivitis is a relatively common ailment, with an estimated incidence reported in primary care settings of approximately 1.5% to 2% in the developed world. Although viral and bacterial conjunctivitis present with differentiating characteristics (eTable 4 in the Supplement), some studies suggest that pathogenic ambiguity can lead to misdiagnoses in as high as half of all cases, meaning that many patients receive inappropriate treatment. However, the unnecessary provision of antibiotics to individuals with the viral rather than the bacterial form of conjunctivitis adds to the development of antimicrobial resistance from overprescription of antibiotics. In reality, most conjunctivitis cases are self-limiting within 1 to 2 weeks of presentation, with minimal risk of long-term vision loss, a spontaneous remission rate that has led to increasing encouragement of a "delayed prescription" or "delayed antibiotic" approach.

Because in our scenario the visual signs and symptoms for viral and bacterial conjunctivitis precluded the SPs from requesting treatment for themselves, the SPs requested treatment for a family member or partner. For case 2A, when symptoms indicate bacterial conjunctivitis, the ideal management specified in the guidelines is prescription of a topical ocular antibiotic or, for mild cases, antiseptic eye drops (Table 2). Ocular lubricants or saline solutions will not treat the infection, although they can relieve some discomfort. Case 2B describes the presentation of viral conjunctivitis for which antiviral drugs are not recommended; rather, treatment is symptomatic and includes saline solution or an ocular lubricant. Diagnostic ambiguity is present because of conspecific symptom overlap between viral conjunctivitis and the most common type of noninfectious conjunctivitis, allergic conjunctivitis, whose incidence is very high. In the empirical analysis, we controlled for the contradistinctive symptoms of itchy or burning eyes and/or a history of allergies by asking the SP (posing as a family member or partner) the following diagnostic questions: "Do they have any allergies?" (with an answer of "No") and "Do they have any other symptoms?" (with an answer of "Yes, they had a cold about a week ago") (eTable 4 in the Supplement).

Introduction

Blepharitis

Lid and ocular surface diseases often share a constellation of signs, including lid margin erythema, meibomian gland inspissation, conjunctivitis, conjunctival erythema, tear film instability, and keratitis. Blepharitis is a common inflammatory ocular disease that affects the eyelid margin, frequently resulting in disruption of the ocular surface and tear film. When present, blepharitis can damage the ocular surface and exacerbate concurrent ocular surface disorders. Because of its chronic nature and frequent comorbidity with other ocular surface diseases, managing these patients can be difficult. There are no FDA-approved treatments specifically for blepharitis, so the goal is often palliative, providing short-term management of signs and symptoms, with strategies such as warm compresses and lid hygiene, topical anti-inflammatory agents, and topical and oral antibiotics. While these options may temporarily relieve patient symptoms, they rarely address the root cause of the disease.

### Conjunctivitis: diagnosis and management [^114ZswsT]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Conjunctivitis caused by viruses, bacteria, or allergies is one of the most common eye conditions in primary care. There is no single sign or symptom that accurately differentiates viral from bacterial conjunctivitis. A comprehensive history and physical examination can guide diagnosis. Viral and allergic conjunctivitis are more common in adults and typically present with watery discharge. Supportive care options for viral conjunctivitis include artificial tears, cold compresses, and antihistamine eye drops. Strict personal hygiene, including frequent handwashing, is essential to decrease the risk of transmission. Topical antihistamines with mast cell-stabilizing activity are the treatment of choice for allergic conjunctivitis. Bacterial conjunctivitis is more common in children and typically presents as mucopurulent discharge with the eyelids matted shut. Delayed antibiotic prescribing has been found to have similar symptom control as immediate prescribing. Ophthalmology referral is indicated for conjunctivitis in a neonate or patients with severe pain, decreased vision, recent ocular surgery, vesicular rash on the eyelids or nose, history of rheumatologic disease, or immunocompromised state.

### A review of the differential diagnosis of acute infectious conjunctivitis: implications for treatment and management [^117SpSi8]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The diagnosis of acute infectious conjunctivitis can be difficult. Clinical ambiguity exists between the acute viral and bacterial as well as the allergic forms, which can confound diagnosis. Also, discrimination between viral or bacterial origins of infectious conjunctivitis based on historical, nonspecific, clinical signs and symptoms contributes to a high rate of misdiagnosis and overuse of antibiotic treatment. Therefore, in order to effectively treat acute infectious conjunctivitis, physicians must be aware of the clinical signs and symptoms and available diagnostic tests that can provide a more accurate differential diagnosis.

### The review of ophthalmic symptoms in COVID-19 [^115VsMmj]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Summary

The medical experience accumulated during the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrates complexity and unpredictability of the effects of this disease. One of the less obvious aspects of the infection is the occurrence of ophthalmological symptoms. Although they are not dominant or common, they can appear at any stage of COVID-19 disease. Moreover, in some cases they may be the first symptoms of a disease, signaling other, more systemic ailments. The role of ophthalmologists in identifying and treating these symptoms is undeniably important. When treating COVID-19 patients, it is important to recognize both typical and atypical ophthalmic symptoms associated with the infection. However, knowledge on this subject should extend beyond the circle of eye disease specialists. All doctors, regardless of their specialty, should be aware of the possibility of such symptoms and ocular complications. Additionally, physicians treating COVID-19 should be alert to the specific risks that may be associated with this disease. Therefore, it is important that ophthalmology specialists participate in treatment teams dealing with COVID-19 patients. Their expertise in the diagnosis and treatment of eye diseases may be crucial in identifying and appropriately treating potential eye complications.

Both ophthalmologists and general practitioners need to remain vigilant regarding the potential, though infrequent, ocular side effects following COVID-19 vaccination. While ocular symptoms occur less frequently in vaccinated individuals compared to those infected with COVID-19, it is crucial for medical professionals to recognize potential links between COVID-19 vaccinations and eye-related symptoms. This knowledge is essential for the prompt identification and management of visual impairments or severe, potentially fatal complications.

Challenges of Acute Infectious Conjunctivitis Management and Diagnosis

Eye care professionals tend to evaluate acute infectious conjunctivitis cases at secondary care visits. Patients with infectious conjunctivitis are suboptimally managed in primary care due to an underappreciation of the prevalence of viral conjunctivitis, as well as frequent antibiotic prescriptions (~80%) for infectious conjunctivitis, despite guidelines that discourage antibiotic use for minor self-limiting illnesses. Antibiotic prescription is a measure of presumed diagnosis of bacterial conjunctivitis, but the rate of clinical accuracy in diagnosing viral conjunctivitis may be < 50%. Observational evidence indicates that laboratory confirmation isolates bacterial pathogens in just 30–50% of suspected cases.

Misdiagnoses expose patients to unnecessary and ineffective antibiotic treatment. In the Antibiotic Resistance Monitoring in Ocular Microorganisms (ARMOR) surveillance study of 3237 ocular isolates collected from patients with bacterial eye infections (from 72 US centers from 2009 to 2013), nearly one-half had methicillin-resistant staphylococci. Although the contribution of topical antibiotics to antibiotic resistance is not easily confirmed, current resistance trends should be considered before treating common eye infections with antibiotics. Furthermore, prescribing antibiotics in cases of unconfirmed bacterial infection is not compliant with Antibiotic Stewardship initiatives, which are part of primary care and pediatric practice protocols. In addition to the risk of antibiotic resistance, misdiagnosis can result in recurrent cases of infectious conjunctivitis, particularly among pediatric patients, or in cases that progress to serious ocular and extra-ocular complications.

There are several challenges to accurately diagnosing acute infectious conjunctivitis. First, clinical ambiguity exists between the acute viral and bacterial as well as the allergic forms, which can confound diagnosis. Discrimination between viral or bacterial origins of infectious conjunctivitis based on historical, nonspecific, clinical signs and symptoms, such as type of discharge, is difficult and not supported by evidence-based diagnostic criteria. Routine bacteriologic examinations are neither typically performed nor practical in the management of clinically suspected acute bacterial conjunctivitis, except in neonates. Culturing should also be considered for immunocompromised patients or for patients with hyperacute cases of infectious conjunctivitis. The misdiagnosis of infectious conjunctivitis is compounded by the view that all cases should be treated with topical ophthalmic antibiotics, even though most are self-limiting. Social factors, such as school policies or pressure to reduce absence from work, may also influence general practitioners to prescribe topical antibiotics. Lastly, the level at which patients enter the health care system can impact the accuracy of the diagnosis.

### A review of the differential diagnosis of acute infectious conjunctivitis: implications for treatment and management [^113PBcU1]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Diagnosis of acute infectious conjunctivitis is complicated because of the signs and symptoms that overlap with other inflammatory conjunctival conditions; therefore, likelihood for misdiagnosis remains high. Misdiagnosis of viral conjunctivitis as bacterial conjunctivitis may result in inappropriate use of antibiotics, which in turn contributes to increased antibiotic resistance. Additionally, misdiagnosis may lead to impaired quality of life and lost productivity due to poor outcomes. Adherence to the American Academy of Ophthalmology evidence-based treatment guidelines and greater educational efforts directed at both patients and physicians could improve the management of acute infectious conjunctivitis. Prescription of antibiotics should be delayed until a bacterial etiology is confirmed, and educational pamphlets should be distributed to general and emergency care practitioners. Development of novel agents with broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity may offer potential new approaches without the drawback of resistance.

### Conjunctivitis: a systematic review of diagnosis and treatment [^115mqPVn]. JAMA (2013). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Conjunctivitis is a common problem.

Objective

To examine the diagnosis, management, and treatment of conjunctivitis, including various antibiotics and alternatives to antibiotic use in infectious conjunctivitis and use of antihistamines and mast cell stabilizers in allergic conjunctivitis.

Evidence Review

A search of the literature published through March 2013, using PubMed, the ISI Web of Knowledge database, and the Cochrane Library was performed. Eligible articles were selected after review of titles, abstracts, and references.

Findings

Viral conjunctivitis is the most common overall cause of infectious conjunctivitis and usually does not require treatment; the signs and symptoms at presentation are variable. Bacterial conjunctivitis is the second most common cause of infectious conjunctivitis, with most uncomplicated cases resolving in 1 to 2 weeks. Mattering and adherence of the eyelids on waking, lack of itching, and absence of a history of conjunctivitis are the strongest factors associated with bacterial conjunctivitis. Topical antibiotics decrease the duration of bacterial conjunctivitis and allow earlier return to school or work. Conjunctivitis secondary to sexually transmitted diseases such as chlamydia and gonorrhea requires systemic treatment in addition to topical antibiotic therapy. Allergic conjunctivitis is encountered in up to 40% of the population, but only a small proportion of these individuals seek medical help; itching is the most consistent sign in allergic conjunctivitis, and treatment consists of topical antihistamines and mast cell inhibitors.

Conclusions and Relevance

The majority of cases in bacterial conjunctivitis are self-limiting and no treatment is necessary in uncomplicated cases. However, conjunctivitis caused by gonorrhea or chlamydia and conjunctivitis in contact lens wearers should be treated with antibiotics. Treatment for viral conjunctivitis is supportive. Treatment with antihistamines and mast cell stabilizers alleviates the symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis.

### COVID-19 and the eye [^114ze9qd]. Clinics in Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

There is growing literature describing the ocular manifestations of COVID-19. We have assessed published reviews, cross-sectional analyses, and clinical reports to summarize the ocular manifestations of the disease and available vaccines, identify the potential role of ocular transmission, and offer basic clinical guidance to health care providers. Ultimately, self-limiting conjunctivitis and conjunctival hyperemia are the most frequently reported ocular findings; several rarer entities may warrant targeted topical therapies. COVID-19 vaccines have been infrequently associated with the development of rare but significant side effects that may warrant ophthalmologist referral as well as specific treatments. Despite the overall low risk of ocular transmission, eye protection is advisable for health care providers in high-risk scenarios. This review should help to guide the assessment of patients with eye complaints in the setting of COVID-19 to promote appropriate diagnosis, treatment, monitoring, and referral.

### Ocular inflammation and infection [^114A3rZs]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Ocular inflammation and infection may involve any part of the eye and surrounding tissue. A complete examination, including visual acuity, extraocular movements, pupillary response, slit lamp examination, and fluorescein staining, is often required to establish the diagnosis. Pain relief may be achieved with oral analgesics and cycloplegics. In most cases, prompt follow-up is required.

### Diagnosis of infectious diseases of the eye [^113AxWjY]. Eye (2012). Low credibility.

Specific therapy of ocular infections often requires etiological diagnosis that is a combined effect of observation of characteristic clinical features and microbiological investigations. Clinical impression is central to guiding the laboratory investigation, and the aim of laboratory investigation is to confirm or rule out the clinical diagnosis. However, clinical features may vary considerably, and no one clinical feature may be pathognomonic of a particular pathogen. In addition, there may be a racial, geographical, and climatic difference in the distribution and type of causative agents associated with infections. Ophthalmologists have at their disposal in vivo and in vitro methods of diagnosis of ocular infections. The expertise of the clinician and the microbiologist along with the facilities available, determine the success with accurate diagnosis. A wide range of conventional and molecular techniques are available that not only provide rapid diagnosis for known common infections but have the potential to bring to the fore unknown organisms that may be associated with ocular infections.

### Fifteen-minute consultation: approach to recurrent cutaneous and ophthalmic herpes simplex virus infection [^115Vd76F]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2025). Medium credibility.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection in children is a common and challenging disease characterised by frequent misdiagnosis, a variety of treatment protocols and frequent recurrences from latent infection. With potential consequences such as pain, disfigurement, self-esteem issues, school exclusion and vision loss in eye disease, early diagnosis, informed management and appropriate interventions to prevent recurrences are essential. Management of HSV disease typically involves the use of oral antivirals for cutaneous disease and a combination of oral and topical treatment for eye disease. For children with recurrent disease, management options include episodic or chronic suppressive treatment for cutaneous disease, while longer-term suppressive therapy is often recommended for eye disease.

### Antibiotics versus placebo for acute bacterial conjunctivitis [^115L23qK]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute bacterial conjunctivitis is an infection of the conjunctiva and is one of the most common ocular disorders in primary care. Antibiotics are generally prescribed on the basis that they may speed recovery, reduce persistence, and prevent keratitis. However, many cases of acute bacterial conjunctivitis are self-limited, resolving without antibiotic therapy. This Cochrane Review was first published in The Cochrane Library in 1999, then updated in 2006, 2012, and 2022.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and side effects of antibiotic therapy in the management of acute bacterial conjunctivitis.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (The Cochrane Library 2022, Issue 5), MEDLINE (January 1950 to May 2022), Embase (January 1980 to May 2022), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) (www.controlled-trials.com), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.

Clinicaltrials

gov), and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases in May 2022. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in which any form of antibiotic treatment, with or without steroid, had been compared with placebo/vehicle in the management of acute bacterial conjunctivitis. This included topical and systemic antibiotic treatments.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently reviewed the titles and abstracts of identified studies. We assessed the full text of all potentially relevant studies and determined the included RCTs, which were further assessed for risk of bias using Cochrane methodology. We performed data extraction in a standardized manner and conducted random-effects meta-analyses using RevMan Web.

Main Results

We included 21 eligible RCTs, 10 of which were newly identified in this update. A total of 8805 participants were randomized. All treatments were topical in the form of drops or ointment. The trials were heterogeneous in terms of their eligibility criteria, the nature of the intervention (antibiotic drug class, which included fluoroquinolones [FQs] and non-FQs; dosage frequency; duration of treatment), the outcomes assessed and the time points of assessment. We judged one trial to be of high risk of bias, four as low risk of bias, and the others as raising some concerns. Based on intention-to-treat (ITT) population, antibiotics likely improved clinical cure (resolution of clinical symptoms or signs) by 26% (RR 1.26, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.46; 5 trials, 1474 participants; moderate certainty) as compared with placebo. Subgroup analysis showed no differences by antibiotic class (P = 0.67) or treatment duration (P = 0.60). In the placebo group, 55.5% (408/735) of participants had spontaneous clinical resolution by days 4 to 9 versus 68.2% (504/739) of participants treated with an antibiotic. Based on modified ITT population, in which participants were analyzed after randomization on the basis of positive microbiological culture, antibiotics likely increased microbiological cure (RR 1.53, 95% CI 1.34 to 1.74; 10 trials, 2827 participants) compared with placebo at the end of therapy; there were no subgroup differences by drug class (P = 0.60). No study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of antibiotic treatment. Patients receiving antibiotics had a lower risk of treatment incompletion than those in the placebo group (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.78; 13 trials, 5573 participants; moderate certainty) and were 27% less likely to have persistent clinical infection (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.81; 19 trials, 5280 participants; moderate certainty). There was no evidence of serious systemic side effects reported in either the antibiotic or placebo group (very low certainty). When compared with placebo, FQs (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.90) but not non-FQs (RR 4.05, 95% CI 1.36 to 12.00) may result in fewer participants with ocular side effects. However, the estimated effects were of very low certainty.

Authors' Conclusions

The findings of this update suggest that the use of topical antibiotics is associated with a modestly improved chance of resolution in comparison to the use of placebo. Since no evidence of serious side effects was reported, use of antibiotics may therefore be considered to achieve better clinical and microbiologic efficacy than placebo. Increasing the proportion of participants with clinical cure or increasing the speed of recovery or both are important for individual return to work or school, allowing people to regain quality of life. Future studies may examine antiseptic treatments with topical antibiotics for reasons of cost and growing antibiotic resistance.

### The eye in systemic infection [^112wweQF]. Lancet (2004). Excellent credibility.

Bacterial, fungal, viral, and parasitic pathogens all cause systemic infection and can spread to the eye. Dissemination of pathogens via the bloodstream can lead to direct involvement of the eye. Visual loss is common in bacterial or fungal endophthalmitis, and toxoplasmosis is a major cause of ocular morbidity and poor vision after congenital or acquired infection. Some infections cause intraocular damage by indirect mechanisms (eg, HIV-mediated immunosuppression), leading to opportunistic infections such as cytomegalovirus infection, periocular nerve involvement due to leprosy, and hypersensitivity reactions in tuberculosis. Eye symptoms might indicate the outcome of an underlying infection, such as development of retinal ischaemia in severe malaria, which is associated with a poor prognosis. Successful outcome for patients with ocular infection depends on close collaboration between clinicians identifying and treating underlying disease, specialist ophthalmic review, and ophthalmic interventional skills (when needed).

Wilderness Medical Society — conjunctivitis in wilderness settings is common, as "Conjunctivitis is the most common cause of a red eye", with "Common etiologies includ[ing] allergies, viruses, and bacteria". Bacterial conjunctivitis "gives a purulent discharge whereas viral conjunctivitis tends to give a watery discharge". Management differs by cause: "Treatment of allergic and viral conjunctivitis is primarily supportive, and bacterial conjunctivitis is treated with antibiotics", and "studies have demonstrated that use of antibiotics results in faster clinical and microbiological remission", with "no studies showing superiority of any one antibiotic" so choice is based on availability; "Erythromycin ointment, 1-cm ribbon, placed in the lower conjunctival sac 3 or 4 times daily for 7 days is a reasonable option". Because "viral conjunctivitis is extremely contagious", "proper hand washing is essential… to avoid spread throughout a group or to the contralateral eye". "Topical anesthetic eye drops are diagnostically beneficial and provide acute relief…; however,… they should not be used chronically as they are toxic to the corneal epithelium". Recommendation ratings: Topical or systemic antibiotics: 1A; Hand washing: 1C.

### Ocular infection and inflammation [^1123g5wo]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Managing the inflamed or infected eye in the emergency setting presents a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge to the emergency physician; the causes and prognoses range from benign, self-limited illness to organ-threatening pathology. A careful history, with attention to comorbid illnesses and time course, is paramount, as is knowledge of the complete ophthalmologic examination. Much of the organ morbidity is ameliorated with prompt therapy in the emergency department and by initiating ophthalmologic consultation. In this article, the authors discuss the diagnosis and treatment of several types of eye infection, including conjunctivitis, episcleritis, keratitis, uveitis, hordeolum and chalazion, dacryocystitis, and cellulitis.

### Conjunctivitis preferred practice pattern [^112ZYxCy]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Mild bacterial conjunctivitis — treatment approach: Mild bacterial conjunctivitis is usually self-limited, and it typically resolves spontaneously without specific treatment in immune-competent adults. Use of topical antibacterial therapy is associated with earlier clinical and microbiological remission compared with placebo in days 2 to 5 of treatment, and these advantages persist over days 6 to 10, but the extent of benefit over placebo lessens over time. Because a 5- to 7-day course of a broad-spectrum topical antibiotic is usually effective, the most convenient or least expensive option can be selected; there is no clinical evidence supporting the superiority of any particular antibiotic. Povidone-iodine 1.25% ophthalmic solution may be as effective as topical antibiotic therapy for treating bacterial conjunctivitis and could be considered when access to antibiotics is limited, such as in low- to middle-income countries, and although there are no data supporting the cost-effectiveness of using antibiotics in mild bacterial conjunctivitis, the shortened morbidity associated with their use makes choice of therapy an individual decision.

### Herpes simplex keratitis: challenges in diagnosis and clinical management [^116Vb3yQ]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) is a ubiquitous DNA virus that can infect virtually anywhere in the body, particularly when newborns are infected.–However, in an individual with a normal immune system, the most common sites of infection are the mouth, genitalia, and eyes. In very young children, and in rare instances adults, the brain may also become infected. HSV infections of the eye are the leading cause of infectious corneal blindness in developed countries. Approximately 500,000 people in the US are currently infected with ocular HSV. The costs of treatment for this disease are in the tens of millions spent annually in the US alone. While most infections are unilateral, around 1.3%–12% of affected individuals have bilateral ocular infections. Bilateral infections are seen mostly in immunocompromised patients.–Infections can occur in both anterior and posterior segments of the eye, but it most commonly infects the corneal epithelia. It is primarily diagnosed by its clinical presentation, but atypical presentation of the infection can impede accurate diagnoses and thus proper treatment.

Conjunctivitis — common features and field care: Among fluorescein‑negative medical eye conditions, conjunctivitis, blepharitis, and ultraviolet keratitis can usually be treated in the field and are typically not serious, and conjunctivitis is the most common cause of a red eye. Common etiologies include allergies, viruses, and bacteria; conjunctivitis always involves the palpebral conjunctiva and the examiner must look under the lid to evaluate for this inflammation. The hallmark of allergic conjunctivitis is itching; bacterial conjunctivitis gives a purulent discharge whereas viral conjunctivitis tends to give a watery discharge. Treatment of allergic and viral conjunctivitis is primarily supportive, and bacterial conjunctivitis is treated with antibiotics.

### American Academy of Ophthalmology recommendations on screening for endogenous Candida endophthalmitis [^116vYk6p]. Ophthalmology (2022). High credibility.

American Academy of Ophthalmology — screening for endogenous Candida endophthalmitis: Ophthalmologic consultation is reasonable for anyone with a clinical rationale including signs or symptoms concerning for an ocular infection, but current evidence does not support a routine ophthalmologic consultation after laboratory findings of systemic Candida septicemia, and this low-value practice should be de-adopted. Systemic management should be tailored to the underlying candidemia, rather than associated ocular findings. Any future recommendations should be developed through collaborative efforts between specialists represented by ophthalmology and infectious diseases, and such efforts and any future studies must eliminate discrepancies regarding the incidence of sight-threatening disease and potential benefit of ophthalmologic screening for candidemia within the literature after carefully applying rigorous definitions, reviewing associated clinical data, including control groups, and including long-term visual outcomes data. These recommendations are based on, but not limited to, safety, efficacy, epidemiology, and pathophysiology of endogenous Candida endophthalmitis.

### Toxocariasis: a review for pediatricians [^115mmMFn]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2014). Low credibility.

Toxocariasis is a parasitic disease caused by roundworms of cats and dogs. The disease is endemic throughout the United States and causes significant morbidity in children, including damage to the lungs, liver, or central nervous system, especially the eyes. Two well established clinical syndromes of disease include visceral and ocular toxocariasis. Symptoms of visceral toxocariasis include abdominal pain, cough, or wheezing. Vision loss or strabismus are common symptoms of ocular toxocariasis. Serologic testing for presence of Toxocara antibody is available, although a positive test result does not necessarily correlate with active clinical infection. Albendazole or mebendazole is the recommended treatment for visceral toxocariasis. Treatment options for ocular toxocariasis include corticosteroids or ophthalmic surgery; anthelminthic medications also may be used. Risk for toxocariasis can be reduced by handwashing after soil contact, routine pets deworming, discouraging geophagia, and appropriate disposal of pet feces.

### A randomised controlled trial of management strategies for acute infective conjunctivitis in general practice [^113JyVu3]. BMJ (2006). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To assess different management strategies for acute infective conjunctivitis.

Design

Open, factorial, randomised controlled trial.

Setting

30 general practices in southern England.

Participants

307 adults and children with acute infective conjunctivitis.

Intervention

One of three antibiotic prescribing strategies-immediate antibiotics (chloramphenicol eye drops; n = 104), no antibiotics (controls; n = 94), or delayed antibiotics (n = 109); a patient information leaflet or not; and an eye swab or not.

Main Outcome Measures

Severity of symptoms on days 1–3 after consultation, duration of symptoms, and belief in the effectiveness of antibiotics for eye infections.

Results

Prescribing strategies did not affect the severity of symptoms but duration of moderate symptoms was less with antibiotics: no antibiotics (controls) 4.8 days, immediate antibiotics 3.3 days (risk ratio 0.7, 95% confidence interval 0.6 to 0.8), delayed antibiotics 3.9 days (0.8, 0.7 to 0.9). Compared with no initial offer of antibiotics, antibiotic use was higher in the immediate antibiotic group: controls 30%, immediate antibiotics 99% (odds ratio 185.4, 23.9 to 1439.2), delayed antibiotics 53% (2.9, 1.4 to 5.7), as was belief in the effectiveness of antibiotics: controls 47%, immediate antibiotics 67% (odds ratio 2.4, 1.1 to 5.0), delayed antibiotics 55% (1.4, 0.7 to 3.0), and intention to reattend for eye infections: controls 40%, immediate antibiotics 68% (3.2, 1.6 to 6.4), delayed antibiotics 41% (1.0, 0.5 to 2.0). A patient information leaflet or eye swab had no effect on the main outcomes. Reattendance within two weeks was less in the delayed compared with immediate antibiotic group: 0.3 (0.1 to 1.0) v 0.7 (0.3 to 1.6).

Conclusions

Delayed prescribing of antibiotics is probably the most appropriate strategy for managing acute conjunctivitis in primary care. It reduces antibiotic use, shows no evidence of medicalisation, provides similar duration and severity of symptoms to immediate prescribing, and reduces reattendance for eye infections.

### Conjunctivitis: a systematic review of diagnosis and treatment [^1138Wf4y]. JAMA (2013). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on infectious conjunctivitis:

- **Definition**: Infectious conjunctivitis is the inflammation of the conjunctiva caused by bacterial, viral, or fungal pathogens.
- **Pathophysiology**: Viruses account for 80% of all cases of acute conjunctivitis, with most cases caused by adenoviruses. Other viral causes include HSV, VZV, EBV, influenza, enterovirus, and coxsackievirus. Bacterial conjunctivitis is commonly caused by S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, and H. influenzae. Ophthalmia neonatorum is typically caused by C. trachomatis or N. gonorrhoeae. Fungal conjunctivitis is rare and usually occurs in immunocompromised patients.
- **Epidemiology**: It is estimated that approximately 6 million cases of acute conjunctivitis occur annually in the US.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors include close contact with infected individuals, poor hand hygiene, use of contaminated contact lenses, and exposure to contaminated water.
- **Disease course**: Clinically, infectious conjunctivitis presents with redness, itching, tearing, discharge, and crusting. Bacterial conjunctivitis often presents with purulent discharge, while viral conjunctivitis usually has a watery discharge and may be associated with upper respiratory tract infection symptoms. Fungal conjunctivitis may present with chronic, indolent symptoms.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Most cases of infectious conjunctivitis are self-limiting, lasting 1–2 weeks. Mild bacterial conjunctivitis typically resolves spontaneously without specific treatment in immunocompetent adults.

### A review of the differential diagnosis of acute infectious conjunctivitis: implications for treatment and management [^113eJ6MH]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Conjunctivitis is a collective term for a diverse group of diseases that are characterized by inflammation of the conjunctiva. The most common cause of infectious conjunctivitis is viral infection (~80% of cases), followed by bacterial. The noninfectious forms are allergic, mechanical/irritative/toxic, immune-mediated, and neoplastic. Of noninfectious conjunctivitis, the allergic form is the most common, affecting approximately 40% of the US population. Conjunctivitis can also be classified as acute, chronic, or recurrent, according to the mode of onset and severity of the clinical response. Most cases of viral and bacterial conjunctivitis are considered acute and, less frequently, as hyperacute. The mechanical/irritative/toxic, immune-mediated, and neoplastic forms are typically associated with chronic inflammation, and the toxic form can have an acute onset. Allergic conjunctivitis can be chronic, with possible onset in childhood, and present with acute exacerbations related to seasonal factors or contact lens use, for example.

Conjunctivitis is a highly common presentation in the primary care setting. It is responsible for ~2% of all medical consultations in the United Statesand countless self-referrals to community pharmacies. It is difficult to accurately capture the true epidemiology of conjunctivitis because of the high numbers of patients who may self-medicate or delay or decline to seek medical care, and because of inaccurate diagnosis in the primary medical care setting. Approximately 70% of all patients with acute red eye present to primary care and urgent care, posing a large economic and social burden.–The pharmacoeconomic impact of infectious conjunctivitis is noteworthy and includes the cost of repeat diagnoses, referrals, insurance copays, patient medications, and lost productivity associated with absence from work or school. In the United States, acute conjunctivitis affects an estimated 6 million people per year, and bacterial conjunctivitis treatment alone costs the United States $377–857 million annually. To the best of our knowledge, no health-related quality-of-life studies of patients with acute infectious conjunctivitis have been published.

The purpose of this narrative review is to provide practical guidance on the differentiation of acute infectious conjunctivitis in the primary care setting and to highlight disconnects between diagnosis and treatment.

### A review of the differential diagnosis of acute infectious conjunctivitis: implications for treatment and management [^112Q6fN6]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Chlamydia is the cause of 1.8–5.6% of all acute conjunctivitis cases. Chlamydial conjunctivitis primarily has a unilateral presentation with concurrent genital infectionand presents with conjunctival redness, lymphoid follicle formation, or mild purulent discharge. A distinctive sign of this infection in adults is bulbar conjunctival follicles, which are absent in neonates/infants. Chlamydial conjunctivitis is typically spread through sexual contact. Chlamydia is the most common sexually transmitted disease in the United States, with 1,708,569 cases reported in 2017. From 2013 to 2017, the number of reported cases of chlamydia in the United States increased by 22%. In neonates, the eyes can be infected after vaginal delivery by infected mothers. Treatment includes oral azithromycin or oral doxycycline in adults, and erythromycin in neonates.

Allergic Conjunctivitis

Most cases of allergic conjunctivitis are attributable to seasonal allergies and present with bilateral symptoms. Mild to severe itching and redness are the key symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis, which can present with a watery or mucoid discharge. Treatment includes supportive measures (cold compress, artificial tears), topical or oral antihistamines, and mast cell inhibitors. A short course of topical corticosteroids can be used in select cases in which corneal involvement and herpetic infection have been ruled out; both conditions could worsen with steroid use.

Differential Diagnosis

To satisfy the American Academy of Ophthalmology Preferred Practice Pattern guidelines that treatment of conjunctivitis is directed at the root cause, physicians should manage patients by taking a systematic approach (Figure 2), considering the epidemiologic spectrum of infectious conjunctivitis, patient history, clinical exam, and — if needed — diagnostic tests.

### The review of ophthalmic symptoms in COVID-19 [^1139rW7q]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 had a significant impact on the health of the global human population, affecting almost every human organ, including the organ of vision. Research focus on understanding the pathophysiology, identifying symptoms and complications of the disease. Eye-related pathologies are important foci of research due to the potential for direct impact of the virus. Ophthalmologists around the world are reporting various symptoms of eye infections and ocular pathologies associated with SARS-CoV-2. The review of ophthalmic symptoms was conducted to help physicians of various specialties recognize possible ophthalmic manifestations of this viral disease. A literature review was conducted from January 2020 to July 2023 in the PubMed, MEDLINE, Science Direct, Scopus, Scielo and Google Scholar databases. The review of the literature showed that conjunctivitis is the most common ophthalmic symptom observed during the course of COVID-19 and can occur at any stage of the disease. Changes in the eye may result from the direct effect of the virus, immune response, prothrombotic states, comorbidities, and medications used. Symptoms related to the organ of vision can be divided into: changes affecting the protective apparatus of the eye, the anterior eye segment, the posterior eye segment, neuro-ophthalmic, and orbital changes. Ocular symptoms may suggest COVID-19 infection or appear several weeks after recovery. Following COVID-19 vaccinations, a diverse range of ophthalmic symptoms was observed in various locations and at different times, mirroring the ocular symptoms experienced throughout the course of the COVID-19 illness. It is important for physicians of all specialties to be aware of possible potential connections between eye diseases and SARS-CoV-2, in order to effectively diagnose and treat patients.

Conclusions

After carefully reviewing the available literature, we found that ocular manifestation can be the first presenting symptom of COVID-19. Eye infection of SARS-CoV-2 could potentially lead to systemic manifestation, although its evidence needs further investigation. Patients with COVID-19 with ocular manifestation were not associated with severe COVID-19. Detecting SARS-CoV-2 from tears yielded a relatively low positivity rate. However, we acknowledged the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 transmission from patients with COVID-19 presenting with only ocular manifestation.

Endophthalmitis is a rare but sight-threatening complication that can occur after ocular surgery or trauma or as a consequence of systemic infection. To optimize visual outcome, early diagnosis and treatment are essential. Over recent decades, advances in hygienic standards, improved microbiologic and surgical techniques, development of powerful antimicrobial drugs, and the introduction of intravitreal antibiotic therapy have led to a decreased incidence and improved management of endophthalmitis. However, endophthalmitis still represents a serious clinical problem. This review focuses on current principles and techniques for evaluation and treatment of endophthalmitis.

### Summary benchmarks-full set – 2024 [^116UHwaU]. AAO (2024). High credibility.

Conjunctivitis management — care management emphasizes that the majority of cases in the adult population are viral and self-limited and do not require antimicrobial treatment, and there is no proven effective treatment for eradication of adenoviral infection; symptomatic measures such as artificial tears, topical antihistamines, topical corticosteroids, oral analgesics or cold compresses may mitigate symptoms, and the use of antibiotics should be avoided because of potential adverse treatment effects. Allergen-specific immunotherapy is beneficial in reducing allergic conjunctivitis, more so in children than in adults. Treatment for vernal conjunctivitis includes environmental modification with cold compresses and ocular lubricants, and for acute exacerbations, topical corticosteroids are usually needed to control severe symptoms (I+, MQ, SR). For contact lens-related keratoconjunctivitis, discontinue contact lens wear until the cornea returns to normal, and in mild cases a brief course of topical corticosteroids in addition to longer-term topical cyclosporine can be considered. Use systemic antibiotic treatment for conjunctivitis due to Neisseria gonorrhoeae or Chlamydia trachomatis; treat sexual partners when conjunctivitis is associated with sexually transmitted diseases and refer patients and their sexual partners to an appropriate medical specialist; refer patients with manifestation of a systemic disease to an appropriate medical specialist.

### Diagnosis and management of red eye in primary care [^115y7vo5]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Red eye is the cardinal sign of ocular inflammation. The condition is usually benign and can be managed by primary care physicians. Conjunctivitis is the most common cause of red eye. Other common causes include blepharitis, corneal abrasion, foreign body, subconjunctival hemorrhage, keratitis, iritis, glaucoma, chemical burn, and scleritis. Signs and symptoms of red eye include eye discharge, redness, pain, photophobia, itching, and visual changes. Generally, viral and bacterial conjunctivitis are self-limiting conditions, and serious complications are rare. Because there is no specific diagnostic test to differentiate viral from bacterial conjunctivitis, most cases are treated using broad-spectrum antibiotics. Allergies or irritants also may cause conjunctivitis. The cause of red eye can be diagnosed through a detailed patient history and careful eye examination, and treatment is based on the underlying etiology. Recognizing the need for emergent referral to an ophthalmologist is key in the primary care management of red eye. Referral is necessary when severe pain is not relieved with topical anesthetics; topical steroids are needed; or the patient has vision loss, copious purulent discharge, corneal involvement, traumatic eye injury, recent ocular surgery, distorted pupil, herpes infection, or recurrent infections.

### A review of the differential diagnosis of acute infectious conjunctivitis: implications for treatment and management [^112Hw1t1]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Bacterial Conjunctivitis

Approximately 32% of acute infectious conjunctivitis cases are caused by bacteria, according to an evaluation of the prevalence of positive bacterial culture in adult patients who presented to their general practitioner with a red eye and either (muco)purulent discharge or glued eyelids. Bacterial conjunctivitis is typically unilateral but can sometimes affect both eyes. The staphylococcal species are the most common pathogens for bacterial conjunctivitis in adults, followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. In children, the bacterial disease is responsible for 50–75% of conjunctivitis cases, often caused by S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, or Moraxella catarrhalis. The hyperacute form of bacterial conjunctivitis is caused by either Neisseria gonorrhoeae or Chlamydia trachomatis.

Acute bacterial conjunctivitis is characterized by a rapid onset of conjunctival redness and mucopurulent discharge. Symptoms may also include burning and itching, though these are less common. Acute bacterial conjunctivitis is self-limiting, resolving within 7–10 days. Use of broad-spectrum topical antibiotics should be delayed, and no evidence demonstrates the superiority of any topical antibiotic agent. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) conjunctivitis is the cause of an estimated 3–64% of ocular staphylococcal infectionsand requires management by an ophthalmologist with antibiotics that are active against MRSA, such as besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension.

The rapid onset and progression of hyperacute bacterial conjunctivitis (often caused by N. gonorrhoeae) warrants immediate ophthalmic management to prevent corneal involvement and potentially perforation. Symptoms include purulent discharge, diminished visual acuity, eye tenderness, and swollen lymph nodes. The increasing incidence of gonorrhea infection was recognized in 2015 as an urgent public health threat in the United States. From 2013 to 2017 the rate of reported gonorrhea cases increased by 67% (555,608 cases in 2017), with an 18.6% increase between 2016 and 2017. Gonococcal ocular infection can present in neonates after vaginal delivery by infected mothers. Treatment includes intramuscular ceftriaxone for adults, children, and neonates, and oral azithromycin or doxycycline for adults. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention treatment guidelines changed in 2015 to support the use of dual therapy with ceftriaxone and azithromycin due to the increased resistance of N. gonorrhoeae to the antimicrobials previously used for treatment. Bacterial conjunctivitis lasting more than 4 weeks is considered chronic.

### Infectious eye disease in the 21st century-an overview [^1152VWSA]. Eye (2024). Medium credibility.

Infectious diseases affecting the eye often cause unilateral or asymmetric visual loss in children and people of working age. This group of conditions includes viral, bacterial, fungal and parasitic diseases, both common and rare presentations which, in aggregate, may account for a significant portion of the global visual burden. Diagnosis is frequently challenging even in specialist centres, and many disease presentations are highly regional. In an age of globalisation, an understanding of the various modes of transmission and the geographic distribution of infections can be instructive to clinicians. The impact of eye infections on global disability is currently not sufficiently captured in global prevalence studies on visual impairment and blindness, which focus on bilateral disease in the over-50s. Moreover, in many cases it is hard to differentiate between infectious and immune-mediated diseases. Since infectious eye diseases can be preventable and frequently affect younger people, we argue that in future prevalence studies they should be considered as a separate category, including estimates of disability-adjusted life years (DALY) as a measure of overall disease burden. Numbers of ocular infections are uniquely affected by outbreaks as well as endemic transmission, and their control frequently relies on collaborative partnerships that go well beyond the remit of ophthalmology, encompassing domains as various as vaccination, antibiotic development, individual healthcare, vector control, mass drug administration, food supplementation, environmental and food hygiene, epidemiological mapping, and many more. Moreover, the anticipated impacts of global warming, conflict, food poverty, urbanisation and environmental degradation are likely to magnify their importance. While remote telemedicine can be a useful aide in the diagnosis of these conditions in resource-poor areas, enhanced global reporting networks and artificial intelligence systems may ultimately be required for disease surveillance and monitoring.

### Viral ocular manifestations: a broad overview [^11437Pwh]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2013). Low credibility.

The viruses able to affect the eye are taxonomically diverse, ranging from double-stranded DNA viruses, to single stranded RNA viruses, to retroviruses. Any part of the eye may be affected, frequently producing blepharitis, conjunctivitis, keratitis, uveitis, cataract and retinitis. The more common ocular viral infections include the Herpesviruses such as HSV-1, VZV and CMV. The HIV pandemic is placing a serious burden on ophthalmology clinics, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa as the number of viral ocular diseases is increasing. In particular, CMV retinitis is becoming more prevalent where antiretroviral therapy is not available and is replaced by immune-recovery uveitis where antiretrovirals are given. This review aims to improve knowledge of the common viral ocular diseases, their diagnosis and management, as well as the fairly uncommon viral ocular diseases that may also cause considerable morbidity.

### Antibiotics versus placebo for acute bacterial conjunctivitis [^116vUc9B]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Acute bacterial conjunctivitis is an infection of the conjunctiva. Both the palpebral and the bulbar ocular conjunctival surfaces are usually affected and typically become red and inflamed. Antibiotic therapy is widely used for the treatment of acute bacterial conjunctivitis. This Cochrane Review was first published in The Cochrane Library in 1999; updated in 2006 and again in 2012.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of antibiotic therapy in the management of acute bacterial conjunctivitis.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 7), MEDLINE (January 1950 to July 2012), EMBASE (January 1980 to July 2012), OpenGrey (System for Information on Grey Literature in Europe) (www.opengrey.eu/), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) (www.controlled-trials.com), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 18 July 2012.

Selection Criteria

We included double-masked randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in which any form of antibiotic treatment had been compared with placebo/vehicle in the management of acute bacterial conjunctivitis. This included topical, systemic and combination (for example, antibiotics and steroids) antibiotic treatments.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors (UN and SM) independently checked and reviewed the titles and abstracts of identified studies. We assessed the full text of all potentially relevant studies. We graded the included RCTs for methodological quality using Cochrane methodology. We performed data extraction in a standardised manner. We performed random-effects meta-analyses using RevMan.

Main Results

We identified 11 eligible RCTs which randomised a total of 3673 participants. One further trial, which was published in abstract form in 1990 but has yet to be reported fully, is currently 'awaiting assessment'. Six of the 11 included studies have been included for the first time in this latest (2012) update. The trials were heterogeneous in terms of their inclusion and exclusion criteria, the nature of the intervention, and the outcome measures assessed. We judged two of the trials to be of high quality and graded the remainder as poor quality. Meta-analyses of data on clinical and microbiological remission rates revealed that topical antibiotics were of benefit in improving 'early' (days two to five) clinical (risk ratio (RR) 1.36, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.15 to 1.61) and microbiological (RR 1.55, 95% CI 1.37 to 1.76) remission rates. At the 'late' time point (days six to 10), antibiotics were found to still confer modest benefits in clinical remission (RR 1.21, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.33) and microbiological cure rates (RR 1.37, 95% CI 1.24 to 1.52). By days six to 10, 41% (95% CI 38 to 43) of cases had resolved in those receiving placebo. We found no data on the cost-effectiveness of antibiotics. No serious outcomes were reported in either the active or placebo arms of these trials, suggesting that important sight-threatening complications are an infrequent occurrence.

Authors' Conclusions

Although acute bacterial conjunctivitis is frequently self limiting, the findings from this updated systematic review suggest that the use of antibiotic eye drops is associated with modestly improved rates of clinical and microbiological remission in comparison to the use of placebo. Use of antibiotic eye drops should therefore be considered in order to speed the resolution of symptoms and infection.

### Use of topical steroids in conjunctivitis: a review of the evidence [^117JkdqQ]. Cornea (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Conjunctivitis, or inflammation of the conjunctiva, is a common condition that can be caused by infectious (eg, bacterial or viral infections) and noninfectious (eg, allergy) etiologies. Treatment involves diagnosis of the underlying cause and use of appropriate therapies. A broad-spectrum therapy that can address multiple etiologies, and also the accompanying inflammation, would be very useful. In this review, we discuss the usefulness of topical ophthalmic corticosteroids and ophthalmic formulations that combine corticosteroids with anti-infectives/antibiotics for treating acute infectious conjunctivitis.

Methods

A review of the published literature and relevant treatment guidelines.

Results

Topical corticosteroids are useful in treating ocular inflammation, but most treatment guidelines recommend steroid use generally in severe cases of conjunctivitis. This is partly due to risks associated with steroid use. These risks include potential for prolonging adenoviral infections and potentiating/worsening herpes simplex virus infections, increased intraocular pressure, glaucoma, and cataracts. Most of these perceived risks are not, however, supported by high-quality clinical data. They are also associated with long-term steroid uses that are dissimilar to applications for infectious conjunctivitis. Clinical data show that ophthalmic formulations that combine corticosteroids with broad-spectrum anti-infectives could be effective and well tolerated when used for short-term treatment (≤ 2 weeks).

Conclusions

Corticosteroids, in combination with anti-infectives, could be a promising treatment option for acute conjunctivitis subject to development of further evidence on their effectiveness and safety in conjunctivitis treatment.

### Medical interventions for fungal keratitis [^114mjxYp]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Fungal infections can involve different parts of the eye and periocular tissues, including the lacrimal apparatus, conjunctiva, eyelids and bony orbit. The most common sites for fungal infections of the eye involve the cornea and the retina or vitreous. Fungal keratitis is a severe infection of the cornea which often results in loss of vision. It most commonly affects young agricultural workers of low socioeconomic status in tropical and subtropical countries. Early intervention with the appropriate treatment is vital to improving outcomes for these patients. There is evidence to suggest the incidence of this condition is increasing globally, particularly in low‐ and middle‐income countries.

### Diagnostic techniques for inflammatory eye disease: past, present and future: a review [^1149qzEj]. BMC Ophthalmology (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Intraocular inflammatory eye diseases though relatively uncommon remain an important cause of visual impairment. For example, uveitis is the third leading cause of blindness. Broadly, the underlying aetiologies are divided into infective and non-infective (presumed autoimmune or autoinflammatory) causes. Since the late 20 th century, advances in molecular techniques have led not only to increasing our understanding of the pathogenetic mechanisms that are associated with various forms non-infectious uveitides, but also to improved refined, sensitive and specific diagnosis of infectious causes. Our understanding of the cellular and molecular pathways enabled in uveitis has led to the adoption of various immunosuppressive agents to overcome the burden of corticosteroid use, traditional and entrenched in uveitis practice. In a recent survey of treatment patterns of non-infectious uveitis by Ophthalmologists in the United States, it was found that up to 60% of patients were still treated with greater than 30mg of steroids for more than 1.5 years as maintenance therapy to control inflammation and the use of immunosuppressive therapy was only used in 12% of patients. 75% of physicians were not aware of treatment guidelines for uveitis. Such guidelines are based on data and evidence that include, over time, the iterative bench-to-bedside translation and delivering clinical evidence for use of anti-metabolites and calcineurin inhibitors. More recently, progress in targeted therapy with biologics targeted against cytokines (e.g. anti-IL-1, anti-IL-6 and anti-TNF-α), soluble mediators (e.g. interferons), or cell surface molecules (e.g. Alemtuzumab and CTLA-4 Ig) are showing great promise in the control of refractory non-infective uveitides. There remains the need to provide randomized controlled trial evidence to confirm their efficacy, some of which are on going. There are increasingly guidelines and algorithms being developed for immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory therapies for non-infectious uveitis by harnessing the increasing evidence being developed, in for example Behcet's disease, and adoption by governments. Arguably on the contrary, infective uveitides are still managed based on the clinician's experience as such a clinical diagnosis is sometimes based on clinical signs and symptoms, supported by demographic information, morphology, laterality and clinical history. One clear example is cytomegalovirus retinitis in HIV. However in practice with many cases, investigations are often necessary to elucidate and differentiate an aetiology and importantly to discriminate those that directly cause an infectious disease versus those evoking an inflammatory disease, such as latent tuberculosis (TB).

### Does this patient with acute infectious conjunctivitis have a bacterial infection? the rational clinical examination systematic review [^112ByJSW]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Acute infectious conjunctivitis is characterized by ocular redness and discharge, and is a common clinical entity. Evidence-based tools to aid the clinical diagnosis of viral vs bacterial conjunctivitis are lacking and may contribute to overprescribing of topical antibiotics.

Objective

To determine the relative prevalence of viral vs bacterial conjunctivitis in adults and children, and to determine which symptoms or signs are suggestive of a viral vs bacterial etiology.

Data Sources

A MEDLINE search (January 1946-March 2022) yielded 1891 articles. Included articles were rated using a quality score based on a modified Rational Clinical Examination grading system. Methodological quality levels 1 through 4 required a microbiological reference standard for diagnosis, whereas quality level 5 (the lowest quality) used a clinical reference standard for diagnosis.

Study Selection

Consecutive series of patients presenting with acute infectious conjunctivitis and case series of viral or bacterial conjunctivitis alone. Thirty-two studies were included in a meta-analysis to determine prevalence and diagnostic accuracy measures; 27 used a microbiological reference standard for diagnosis and 5 used a clinical reference standard for diagnosis.

Results

In studies involving children (5 studies; 881 patients; mean age, 4.7 years [age range, 1 month-18 years]), the prevalence of bacterial conjunctivitis was higher than viral conjunctivitis (71% vs 16%, respectively, P = 0.01). In the only study of adults (n = 207 patients; mean age, 25.7 years), the prevalence of viral conjunctivitis was higher than bacterial conjunctivitis (78% vs 16%, respectively, P < .001). For the primary analysis of level 1 (n = 6) and level 2 (n = 5) studies (1725 patients total), the clinical findings that best distinguished a viral etiology for conjunctivitis from a bacterial etiology included pharyngitis (sensitivity range, 0.55–0.58; specificity range, 0.89–0.94; positive likelihood ratio [LR] range, 5.4–9.9), preauricular lymphadenopathy (sensitivity range, 0.17–0.31; specificity range, 0.93–0.94; positive LR range, 2.5–5.6), and contact with another person with red eye (sensitivity, 0.18 [95% CI, 0.14–0.22]; specificity, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.90–0.95]; positive LR, 2.5 [95% CI, 1.6–3.7]). Mucopurulent ocular discharge (sensitivity, 0.76 [95% CI, 0.60–0.87); specificity, 0.66 [95% CI, 0.58–0.73]; positive LR, 2.1 [95% CI, 1.7–2.6]) and otitis media (sensitivity, 0.24 [95% CI, 0.20–0.29]; specificity, 0.91 [95% CI, 0.85–0.94]; positive LR, 2.5 [95% CI, 1.5–4.4]) were associated with the presence of bacterial conjunctivitis.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this review, bacterial conjunctivitis was more common than viral conjunctivitis in children and viral conjunctivitis was more common than bacterial conjunctivitis in adults, although the prevalence estimates were based on limited evidence. Symptoms and signs associated with a higher likelihood of viral conjunctivitis in adults and children included concomitant pharyngitis, an enlarged preauricular node, and contact with another person with red eye, and signs associated with a higher likelihood of bacterial conjunctivitis included the presence of mucopurulent discharge and otitis media, but no single symptom or sign differentiated the 2 conditions with high certainty.

### Dry eye symptoms and impact on vision-related function across international task force guidelines severity levels in the United States [^115nF17E]. BMC Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Dry eye disease is frequently undertreated. Barriers to appropriate treatment include the time required to adequately diagnose and determine appropriate treatment based on the patient's severity level, the perception by clinicians that the condition has minor impact on patient well-being, the perception by patients that the disease is normal or less important than other conditions that require treatment, lack of understanding of the disease process, and a perceived paucity of therapeutic options. Supplemental artificial tears and eyelid hygiene are common treatment modalities for dry eye disease, yet many patients continue to experience significant disruption to their daily lives. Our findings suggest that dry eye symptoms are frequently troublesome to the patient at all levels of disease severity, and require attention and adequate treatment. A complete and comprehensive medical and ocular history conducted by clinicians should help correctly identify patients who may have ambiguous symptoms without clinical signs or vice versa, and allow proper treatment and management of dry eye disease.

### What is causing the corneal ulcer? Management strategies for unresponsive corneal ulceration [^114QmMoF]. Eye (2012). Low credibility.

Infectious keratitis represents a significant cause of ocular morbidity in the United States. The work-up and treatment of presumed infectious keratitis (PIK) has changed in the past two decades. The development of newer topical antibiotics has enabled broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage with good tissue penetration. The majority of PIK cases respond well to this strategy. The small numbers of cases that do not respond to the treatment are the cases that offer a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. This review will describe different algorithms that can be followed for the successful management of patients with difficult or progressive PIK. These algorithms are based on scientific work and on our empirical clinical experience. The review will also present three different clinical cases of PIK that were managed according to the algorithms presented in this review.

### Sore eyes as the most significant ocular symptom experienced by people with COVID-19: a comparison between pre-COVID-19 and during COVID-19 States [^115Pdd9Z]. BMJ Open Ophthalmology (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

SARS-CoV-2 is the cause of COVID-19, which has been shown to be primarily a respiratory illness, with the most common symptoms being a new continuous cough and high temperature. Further symptoms have been added to this list, and the WHO added conjunctivitis a less common symptom. Ocular manifestations of COVID-19 have not been at the forefront of substantial research, possibly due to the life-threatening nature of the other more serious respiratory symptoms which have resulted in high numbers of mortality around the world. This might have resulted in other non-life-threatening symptoms not given importance in the presence of other life-threatening conditions. However, the type, frequency and ocular transmission of the virus must not be ignored, especially as the eye has been recognised as one of the organs through which the virus might enter the body.

### American Academy of Ophthalmology recommendations on screening for endogenous Candida endophthalmitis [^116Ft8SP]. Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

The American Academy of Ophthalmology evaluated the practice of routine screening for intraocular infection from Candida septicemia. In the United States, ophthalmologists are consulted in the hospital to screen for intraocular infection routinely for patients with Candida bloodstream infections. This practice was established in the era before the use of systemic antifungal medication and the establishment of definitions of ocular disease with candidemia. A recent systematic review found a rate of less than 1% of routinely screened patients with endophthalmitis from Candida septicemia. Other studies found higher rates of endophthalmitis but had limitations in terms of inaccuracies in ocular disease classification, lack of vitreous biopsies, selection biases, and lack of longer-term visual outcomes. Some studies attributed ocular findings to Candida infections, rather than other comorbidities. Studies also have not demonstrated differences in medical management that are modified for eye disease treatment; therefore, therapy should be dictated by the underlying Candida infection, rather than be tailored on the basis of ocular findings. In summary, the Academy does not recommend a routine ophthalmologic consultation after laboratory findings of systemic Candida septicemia, which appears to be a low-value practice. An ophthalmologic consultation is a reasonable practice for a patient with signs or symptoms suggestive of ocular infection regardless of Candida septicemia.

### Clinical and microbiological characteristics of meningococcal eye infections: retrospective national surveillance in england, 2010–2022 [^1174rQK2]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Neisseria meningitidis is primarily associated with severe systemic infections but can infect the eye and periocular tissues. Most meningococcal eye infections have a mild prognosis, but there is a significant increase in the risk of invasive disease. UK public health guidelines recommend chemoprophylaxis for meningococcal eye infection cases and contacts. This study involved a clinical and microbiological analysis of meningococcal eye infections in England over a thirteen-year period.

Methods

The analysis included all English cases of eye infection with confirmed isolation of N. meningitidis from ocular samples between 2010 and 2022. Microbiological data were integrated with clinical information collected by public health professionals, including age, clinical presentation, and treatment.

Results

Among 263 meningococcal eye infection cases, nearly half were observed in infants, with the highest risk in neonates. Conjunctivitis was the most common presentation, and most cases resolved without complications following treatment. Young children were more likely to receive intravenous antibiotics compared to older age groups. Around 3% of cases progressed to invasive disease (groups B, Y or W); however, all patients survived. Most eye-derived isolates were non-groupable and reflected the profile of carriage strains in the UK indicating an incidental infection not requiring encapsulation.

Conclusions

Meningococcal eye infections typically reflect strains circulating within the population suggesting they arise from exposure to respiratory secretions. While cases often present with mild symptoms, the risk of invasive disease shortly after onset highlights the need for prompt recognition, systemic treatment, and a swift public health response.

### The mydriatic red eye as the initial presentation of syphilis [^114d2c44]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection that has been increasing in prevalence since the early 2000s. Ocular involvement occurs in a minority of patients and must be in the differential diagnosis for patients who present with red eye and uveitis.

Case Report

A 29-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with a painful, mydriatic red eye. Review of systems revealed a rash as well as a recent genital lesion and, on further questioning, she admitted to a history of intravenous drug use and high-risk sexual activity. Ophthalmology was consulted and the patient was diagnosed with bilateral uveitis. Serologic testing was positive for syphilis, and she was admitted and treated with intravenous penicillin, with resolution of her uveitis. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Red eye is a common ocular symptom in patients presenting to the emergency department. The differential diagnosis of the red eye is broad and can range from benign etiologies, such as conjunctivitis, to life- and sight-threatening conditions, such as endogenous endophthalmitis. Systemic diseases such as syphilis may present with primarily ocular symptoms, and ocular syphilis must be identified and managed appropriately to prevent devastating sequelae.

### Clinical significance and pathogenesis of viral respiratory infections [^115q3tXt]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Viral respiratory tract infections, also known as colds, are the most common infection in humans. The majority of these infections are caused by rhinoviruses. Rhinovirus deposition in the nose or the eye initiates infection. The virus attaches to the host cell intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) receptors in the back of the throat. Subsequent viral replication triggers the release of inflammatory mediators and activation of neurogenic pathways, which lead to symptoms. Symptoms occur within 10 to 16 hours after virus entry into the nose and peak on days 2 to 3 of infection. Symptom duration is typically 1 week, although 25% of cases last longer. Understanding the chronology of these events is important in the timing of treatment. Because of the rapidity of symptom onset, early treatment is the key to reducing viral replication and illness. Also, early treatment may reduce the risk of transmission.

### Endophthalmitis: a review of current evaluation and management [^1123LgC4]. Retina (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

To review the current state of evaluation and management of various forms of endophthalmitis.

Methods

A review of the literature is included, encompassing endophthalmitis occurring after ocular surgeries, intravitreal injection, trauma, and systemic infection. Based on this review, current principles and techniques for evaluating and treating these forms of endophthalmitis are discussed.

Results

Postoperative endophthalmitis after cataract surgery is the most common presentation. Conclusions from the Endophthalmitis Vitrectomy Study (EVS) remain a foundation for management of postcataract surgery endophthalmitis, notably prompt intravitreal antibiotic administration after vitreous sampling, with consideration for pars plana vitrectomy in severe cases. The potential impact of advances since the EVS, such as oral fourth generation fluoroquinolones and new vitrectomy techniques, are also discussed. The management of postcataract endophthalmitis is compared and contrasted to endophthalmitis occurring after other ocular surgeries, intravitreal injection, trauma, and systemic infection. Although some principles remain common, treatment rationales differ with other forms of endophthalmitis based on differing clinical circumstances, such as the virulence of organisms that are frequently encountered.

Conclusions

Endophthalmitis is a serious, potentially vision threatening condition which can present in various settings. Prompt recognition and treatment are key in maximizing outcomes.

What is already known about this subject?

Bacterial conjunctivitis is common and often treated empirically with topical antimicrobials. Inappropriate use of antimicrobials has led to increased bacterial resistance.

What are the new findings?

Among Gram-positive bacteria, the most prevalent cause of bacterial conjunctivitis, chloramphenicol sensitivity remains high.

How might these results change the focus of research or clinical practice?

Topical chloramphenicol remains a suitable first-line treatment for bacterial conjunctivitis.

### Conjunctivitis preferred practice pattern [^114zXC3p]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Adenoviral conjunctivitis — The majority of adult acute infectious conjunctivitis cases are viral and self-limited and do not require antimicrobial treatment. Patients with adenoviral conjunctivitis need to understand that the condition is highly contagious and that the virus can survive for many weeks on surfaces if careful disinfection doesn't occur; this infection is often referred to as epidemic keratoconjunctivitis (EKC). Patients should be educated about measures to reduce spread and encouraged to make every attempt to minimize contact with other people for 10 to 14 days from the onset of symptoms in the last eye affected.

### Conjunctivitis preferred practice pattern [^112RASn5]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Herpes simplex virus conjunctivitis — Herpes simplex virus conjunctivitis is a self-limited acute condition, and possible topical options include ganciclovir 0.15% gel used three to five times per day or trifluridine 1% solution five to eight times per day; oral treatments include acyclovir (200 to 400 mg five times a day), valacyclovir (500 mg two or three times a day), or famciclovir (250 mg twice a day). Topical trifluridine inevitably causes epithelial toxicity if used for more than 2 weeks, whereas topical ganciclovir is less toxic to the ocular surface. Oral antivirals alone may not be adequate in preventing the progression of HSV blepharoconjunctivitis, but the addition of topical antiviral treatment has been effective, and lower doses of oral antivirals are considered for long-term prophylaxis against recurrent HSV conjunctivitis and keratitis. Topical corticosteroids potentiate HSV epithelial infections and should be avoided. Within 1 week of treatment, patients should have a follow-up visit consisting of an interval history, visual acuity measurement, and slit-lamp biomicroscopy, and neonates require prompt consultation with the pediatrician or primary care physician because systemic HSV infection is a life-threatening condition.

### Effect of topical antibiotics on duration of acute infective conjunctivitis in children: a randomized clinical trial and a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1177nUqX]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Are topical antibiotics effective for the management of acute infective conjunctivitis in children?

Findings

In this randomized clinical trial with 88 participants, use of topical antibiotics reduced the time to clinical cure, and in the meta-analysis with 584 participants, the use of topical antibiotics was associated with a significant reduction in the proportion of children who had symptoms of conjunctivitis on days 3 to 6 compared with those receiving a placebo.

Meaning

These findings suggest that topical antibiotic therapy should be considered for acute infective conjunctivitis in children because antibiotics were associated with significantly shorter recovery times.

### Conjunctivitis preferred practice pattern [^1112KZBq]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Conjunctivitis pharmacotherapy stewardship: Indiscriminate use of topical antibiotics or corticosteroids should be avoided, because viral conjunctivitis will not respond to antibacterial agents and mild bacterial conjunctivitis is likely to be self-limited; for acute exacerbations of vernal conjunctivitis, topical corticosteroids are usually necessary, and no evidence exists demonstrating the superiority of any topical antibiotic agent.

Wilderness eye pathologies — evidence scope and treatment realities are summarized as follows: Wilderness eye pathologies encompass a diverse group of injuries and illnesses that often require specialized equipment, medications, and expertise, and although this review provides an evidence-based overview of the most commonly encountered eye pathologies experienced in the wilderness, evidence regarding wilderness treatment is limited to case reports and the extrapolation of clinical and hospital care. Treatment in the wilderness is often based on available supplies and treatments rather than on the most evidence-based interventions, and with proper planning, tools, and physical examination skills, most providers can determine the need for further intervention or evacuation in cases of ocular pathology in the wilderness.

### Bacterial conjunctivitis [^114Gxx2a]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2012). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Most cases of conjunctivitis in adults are probably due to viral infection, but children are more likely to develop bacterial conjunctivitis than they are viral forms. The main bacterial pathogens are Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae in adults and children, and Moraxella catarrhalis in children. Contact lens wearers may be more likely to develop gram-negative infections. Bacterial keratitis occurs in up to 30 per 100,000 contact lens wearers.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of empirical treatment in adults and children with suspected bacterial conjunctivitis? What are the effects of treatment in adults and children with bacteriologically confirmed bacterial conjunctivitis? What are the effects of treatment in adults and children with clinically confirmed gonococcal conjunctivitis? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to July 2011 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 44 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: ocular decongestants, oral antibiotics, parenteral antibiotics, saline, topical antibiotics, and warm compresses.

### Ocular herpes simplex [^115mTR2H]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2008). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Ocular infection with herpes simplex virus (HSV) is usually acquired early in life, with 50% of people from higher and 80% from lower socioeconomic groups in the United States having antibodies by the age of 30 years. Attacks usually resolve spontaneously within 1–2 weeks, but 50% of people will experience a recurrence within 10 years.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatments in people with epithelial keratitis? What are the effects of treatments in people with stomal keratitis? What are the effects of interventions to prevent recurrence of ocular herpes simplex? What are the effects of interventions to prevent recurrence of ocular herpes simplex in people with corneal grafts? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to July 2007 (BMJ Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found seven systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: adding oral aciclovir to topical corticosteroids plus topical antiviral treatment; adding topical corticosteroids to topical antiviral treatment; antiviral agents (topical); debridement; interferons (topical); and oral aciclovir.

### Cornea / external disease summary benchmarks – 2024 [^115scch9]. AAO (2024). High credibility.

Conjunctivitis — care management outlines symptomatic care for viral disease, targeted therapy for allergic and vernal forms, measures for contact lens–related keratoconjunctivitis, and management when sexually transmitted pathogens are involved. The majority of cases in the adult population are viral and self-limited, and do not require antimicrobial treatment; there is no proven effective treatment for eradication of adenoviral infection, artificial tears, topical antihistamines, topical corticosteroids, oral analgesics or cold compresses may mitigate symptoms, and the use of antibiotics should be avoided because of potential adverse treatment effects. Allergen-specific immunotherapy is beneficial in reducing allergic conjunctivitis, more so in children than in adults. Treat mild allergic conjunctivitis with an over-the-counter antihistamine/vasoconstrictor agent or second-generation topical histamine H1-receptor antagonists; if the condition is frequently recurrent or persistent, mast-cell stabilizers can be used, and new medications combine antihistamine activity with mast-cell stabilizing properties. Treatment for vernal conjunctivitis includes modifying the environment and use of cold compresses and ocular lubricants, and for acute exacerbations, topical corticosteroids are usually needed to control severe symptoms (I+, MQ, SR). For contact lens-related keratoconjunctivitis, discontinue contact lens wear until the cornea returns to normal, and in mild cases a brief course of topical corticosteroids, in addition to longer-term use of topical cyclosporine, can be considered. Use systemic antibiotic treatment for conjunctivitis due to Neisseria gonorrhoeae or Chlamydia trachomatis, treat sexual partners when conjunctivitis is associated with sexually transmitted diseases and refer patients and their sexual partners to an appropriate medical specialist, and refer patients with manifestation of a systemic disease to an appropriate medical specialist.

### Bacterial keratitis preferred practice pattern ® [^115WDUig]. Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on bacterial keratitis:

- **Definition**: Bacterial keratitis is a corneal infection caused by bacteria, characterized by pain, redness, inflammation, and opacity of the cornea.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of bacterial keratitis involves the entry of bacteria into the cornea, often facilitated by a disruption in the ocular epithelial surface. The bacteria then proliferate and release tissue-damaging proteases and toxins, leading to an inflammatory response.
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of keratitis in the US is estimated at 27.6 per 100,000 person-years.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for bacterial keratitis include the use of contact lenses, the presence of ocular surface diseases, ocular trauma, administration of topical corticosteroids, history of ocular surgery, and exposure to certain environmental factors.
- **Disease course**: Clinically, patients with bacterial keratitis often present with symptoms such as pain, redness, discharge, blurred vision, and photophobia. On examination, suppurative stromal infiltrates with indistinct edges, corneal edema, and white cell infiltration in the surrounding stroma are often observed. An epithelial defect is typically present, and an anterior chamber reaction is often observed.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of bacterial keratitis can vary, but it can lead to severe visual impairment if not treated promptly.

### Causes and how It spreads… [^113rDq7w]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Pink eye caused by viruses or bacteria is very contagious.
- Allergens and irritants can also cause pink eye, but these are not contagious.
- Sometimes it is hard to determine the cause because some symptoms are the same no matter the cause. Causes Most common causes of pink eye are viruses, bacteria, and allergens. Less common causes include irritants such as:

- Chemicals
- Contact lens wear
- Foreign bodies in the eye
- Indoor and outdoor air pollution caused by smoke, dust, fumes, or chemical vapors
- Fungi
- Ameba and parasites. Viruses Very contagiousand sometimes can lead to large outbreaks depending on the virus. Cause: A number of different viruses, such as adenoviruses. Occurs: Viral pink eye can also occur with a common cold or respiratory infection. Bacteria Very contagiousand can spread easily with certain bacteria and in certain settings. More common in kids than adults, especially shortly after birth.

Cause: Certain bacteria. Occurs: More frequently from December through April; can occur at the same time as an ear infection. Irritants Not contagiousfrom person to person. Cause: Irritation from a foreign body in the eye or contact with smoke, dust, fumes, or chemicals Occurs: When contact lenses are worn longer than recommended or not cleaned properly. How it spreads Pink eye caused by viruses and bacteria can easily spread from person to person in different ways. You can get pink eye from: Close personal contact, such as touching or shaking hands. Contact with dropletsfrom the air after an infected coughs or sneezes. Touching objects and surface swith germs on them, then touching your eyes before washing your hands. Prevent getting or spreading pink eye by practicing good hygiene, including washing your hands often for at least 20 seconds.

### What causes contact lens-related eye infections… [^116nH1Mj]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

At a glance
- Neglecting proper eye care and contact lens maintenance can increase the risk of eye complications like keratitis.
- Practice appropriate healthy eye habits while wearing contact lenses to prevent infections. Overview Contact lenses provide vision benefits, but they are not risk-free. Contact lens wear is linked to higher risk of keratitis or inflammation of the cornea. Keratitis in contact lens wearers can be caused by many factors. One type of keratitis, called microbial keratitis, can occur when germs invade the cornea. These germs — such as viruses, bacteria, fungi, or parasites — are more likely to invade the eyes when contact lenses are worn for too long or are not cared for correctly. Microbial keratitis is a serious type of eye infection in contact lens wearers, which can lead to blindness or the need for corneal transplant in the most severe cases.

Types of microbial keratitis
- Bacterial keratitis
- Fungal keratitis
- Parasitic/Amebic keratitis
- HSV keratitis. Microbial keratitis symptoms
- Irritated, red eyes
- Worsening pain in or around the eyes — even after contact lens removal
- Light sensitivity
- Sudden blurry vision
- Unusually watery eyes or discharge If you experience any of these symptoms, remove your contact lenses and call your eye doctor immediately.
- Dry eyes
- Allergies affecting the eyes
- **Giant Papillary Conjunctivitis**: bumps that appear underneath the eyelid
- **Corneal abrasion**: a scratch or scrape on the cornea
- **Contact Lens-induced Acute Red Eye**: red, irritated eyes
- **Corneal infiltrates**: irritation of the cornea indicating inflammation and possible infection
- **Neovascularization**: new blood vessels growing onto the cornea, sometimes causing eye redness.

Prevention methods Microbial keratitis can usually be prevented through proper eye health and care of contact lenses and supplies. Most complications can be easily treated by an eye doctor. However, more serious infections can result in vision loss or blindness if left untreated. If you experience unusual eye irritation:

- Promptly remove your contact lenses
- Avoid wearing contact lenses again until advised by your eye doctor
- See an eye doctor Keep ReadingPreventing Eye Infections when You Wear Contacts.

### Key points… [^113eify2]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Fungal eye infections are extremely rare but can be very serious.
- Most fungal eye infections occur from eye injuries.
- Eye surgeries and bloodstream infections can also cause fungal eye infections.
- Fungal eye infections are treated with prescription antifungal medications. Overview Eye infections can be caused by many different organisms, including bacteria, viruses, amoeba, and fungi. Eye infections caused by fungi are extremely rare but can be very serious. Types There are two main types of fungal eye infections, depending on the part of the eye that is infected. Many types of fungi can cause eye infections. Types of infections The two types of fungal eye infections are keratitis and endophthalmitis. Keratitis is an infection of the clear, front layer of the eye. Endophthalmitis is an infection of the inside of the eye. Endophthalmitis can occur two different ways.

Exogenous fungal endophthalmitis occurs after fungal spores enter the eye from an external source. Endogenous fungal endophthalmitis occurs when a bloodstream infection spreads to one or both eyes. Many types of fungi can cause infections. Fusarium–lives in the environment, especially in soil and on plants. Aspergillus– common mold foundi n indoor and outdoor environments. Candida– a type of yeast that normally lives in and on the body. Symptoms The symptoms of a fungal eye infection can show up anytime from several days to several weeks after an exposure. Fungal eye infection symptoms are similar to those of other types of eye infections, like those caused by bacteria. Symptoms can include:

- Eye pain
- Eye redness
- Blurred vision
- Sensitivity to light
- Excessive tearing
- Eye discharge.

Treatment and recovery The treatment for a fungal eye infection depends on the type of fungus, the severity of the infection, and the parts of the eye that are affected. Possible forms of treatment for fungal eye infections include:

- Antifungal eye drops.
- Antifungal medication given as a pill.
- Antifungal medication injected. Eye surgery may be needed if infections do not get better after using antifungal medications. More resources on fungal diseases Communication and Educational Materials Webinars, Podcasts, and Clinical Tools.

### For clinicians… [^114Xxkdx]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

- Picornaviruses, such as coxsackievirus A24 and enterovirus 70. Signs and symptoms of bacterial conjunctivitis overlap with other causes of conjunctivitis, including viral and allergic conjunctivitis, which can make diagnosis difficult. Typical signs and symptoms include:

- Red eye
- Purulent discharge that causes eyelids to be matted together
- Chemosis
- Decreased vision
- Eyelid swelling and pain Contact lens wearers with bacterial conjunctivitis are at higher risk of bacterial keratitis. They should be asked to remove their contact lenses, treated with topical antibiotics, and promptly evaluated by an ophthalmologist. Types of bacterial conjunctivitis include:

Acute bacterial conjunctivitis
- Is the most common form of bacterial conjunctivitis
- In children is often caused by Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, or Moraxella catarrhalis
- Is typically self-limited within 1–2 weeks, but topical antibiotic therapy may reduce the duration of disease. Hyperacute bacterial conjunctivitis
- Is a very rare and severe type of conjunctivitis with rapid onset and progression, as well as severe symptoms, including massive exudate, severe chemosis, eyelid swelling, marked hyperemia, pain, and decreased vision
- Caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeaeor Neisseria meningitidis
- Requires both parenteral and topical antibiotic therapy
- Can progress to corneal infiltrates, melting and perforation and vision loss if not treated promptly by an ophthalmologist.
- Acute disease is commonly unilateral with hyperemia and purulent discharge and caused by Chlamydia trachomatissubtypes D through K
- Many patients will have a mild prolonged course
- Presenting with chlamydial conjunctivitis will have an associated genital infection
- Acute disease is commonly unilateral with hyperemia and purulent discharge and caused by
- Trachoma
- The leading global cause of preventable blindness
- A chronic follicular conjunctivitis caused by. Chlamydia trachomatissubtypes A through C
- Causes scarring of the inner eyelid which can cause the eyelashes to turn in and scratch the cornea, leading to permanent damage
- Transmitted from person to person through contact with discharge from the eyes or nose of an infected person, through shared items, or by flies spreading ocular secretions.

### How fungal eye infections happen… [^116Wvgkw]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

How Fungal Eye Infections Happen What Causes Fungal Eye Infections. Eye Injuries The most common way for someone to get a fungal eye infection is because of an eye injury, particularly if plant material such as a stick or a thorn 1 caused the injury. Some fungi that cause eye infections, such as Fusarium, live in the environment and are often associated with plant material. Fungi can enter the eye and cause infection after an injury. Eye Surgery Less often, infection can occur after eye surgery such as corneal transplant surgery or cataract surgery. People who have had surgery to replace their corneas are at higher risk of fungal eye infections. Each year, about 50, 000 Americans have a corneal transplant to replace injured or diseased corneas. A small number of people who have this surgery develop a fungal eye infection.

From 2007 to 2014, endophthalmitis, or infection of the interior of the eye, became more than twice as common for people with recent corneal transplant surgery. 2 In the past, this type of endophthalmitis was most commonly caused by bacteria. However, now fungi cause about two-thirds of infections. CDC is working with partners to understand the reasons for this increase in fungal endophthalmitis following corneal transplant surgery and to find ways to prevent it. Invasive Eye Procedure Fungal eye infections could happen after an invasive eye procedure such as an injection. Some infections have been traced to contaminated medical products such as contact lens solution, 3 irrigation solution 4 and dye 5 used during eye surgery, or corticosteroids injected directly into the eye.
5. Fungal Bloodstream Infection Rarely, fungal eye infections can happen after a fungal bloodstream infection such as candidemia spreads to the eye.
