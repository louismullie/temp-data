## Question

should someone with a kidney transplant take low dose aspirin

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether someone with a kidney transplant should take low-dose aspirin and under what circumstances it is indicated or should be avoided. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the patient's cardiovascular risk profile because that drives secondary versus primary prevention decisions. Then, I should verify current guideline recommendations for kidney transplant recipients and how they align with CKD and general cardiology guidance. Next, I will examine direct and indirect evidence on efficacy and bleeding risk, including KTR-specific data. After that, I need to consider perioperative and special contexts like pregnancy, and finally, I should review practical dosing, interactions, and a decision framework with shared decision-making and monitoring considerations.

> Let me first confirm the risk framing: kidney transplant recipients carry markedly elevated cardiovascular risk compared with the general population, with CVD often the leading cause of death and a major driver of graft loss after the first post-transplant year, so I should treat CVD risk in KTRs at least as intensively as in high-risk non-transplant patients, recognizing the balance with bleeding risk inherent to CKD and immunosuppression [^1145yE2q] [^1165rHJM].

> I will now examine indications for secondary prevention. If the patient has established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, the recommendation is strong to use low-dose aspirin for prevention of recurrent ischemic events; KDIGO 2024 explicitly recommends low-dose aspirin for secondary prevention in CKD with established ischemic CVD, and KDOQI commentary endorses this approach in CKD with appropriate caution about bleeding, so transplant recipients with established CVD should generally be on aspirin unless contraindicated [^1179PC6w] [^1113xgC6].

> Wait, let me verify primary prevention guidance, because this is where uncertainty lies. KDOQI commentary on KDIGO 2009 suggests aspirin can be considered for primary prevention in adult KTRs unless contraindicated, but the evidence quality is low and transplant-specific randomized data are lacking. Contemporary KDIGO 2024 focuses on secondary prevention and notes the paucity of primary prevention evidence in CKD, and ACC/AHA 2019 advises against routine aspirin for primary prevention when bleeding risk factors are present, which often includes CKD and polypharmacy in transplant recipients [^1165rHJM] [^1113xgC6] [^115JWA3C].

> Hold on, I should review direct transplant evidence before concluding. A post hoc analysis of FAVORIT in stable KTRs without prior CVD found no reduction in incident CVD, mortality, or kidney failure with aspirin use, supporting the notion that routine primary prevention aspirin is not beneficial in KTRs. This aligns with the broader CKD literature showing uncertain net benefit for primary prevention due to increased bleeding risk, even though a modest reduction in myocardial infarction may be seen in pooled CKD analyses [^1165rHJM] [^114aoceA].

> I need to check bleeding risk carefully. Cochrane analyses in CKD show that antiplatelet therapy probably increases major bleeding by about 35% and minor bleeding by about 55%, and in hemodialysis AVG populations, dual antiplatelet therapy increased bleeding without clear thrombotic benefit. In transplant cohorts, UK-HARP showed a 3-fold increase in minor bleeds with 100 mg aspirin without excess major bleeding, but that does not negate the overall bleeding hazard that is higher in CKD and may be compounded by immunosuppression and procedural needs [^114aoceA] [^114jx15b] [^114zcyXX].

> But wait, what about peri-transplant and peri-procedural contexts. KDIGO recommends stopping antiplatelet agents other than aspirin 5 days before living donor transplantation and generally continuing single-agent aspirin when clinically indicated, and for biopsies, contemporary interventional data suggest that low-dose aspirin exposure does not meaningfully increase bleeding risk, whereas high-dose aspirin within 3 days does. This supports individualized holding strategies rather than a blanket stop for low-dose aspirin around procedures [^114226xv] [^115K96zK] [^115LtK2m].

> Let me consider pregnancy, because this is a special case. I should confirm that in kidney transplant recipients who are pregnant or planning pregnancy, daily low-dose aspirin starting at 12 weeks is recommended for preeclampsia prophylaxis, with benefits extending to reducing risks of superimposed preeclampsia and potentially allograft complications. Multiple transplant and obstetric guidelines endorse this practice unless contraindicated, so aspirin is appropriate here regardless of primary/secondary CVD status [^115UXNwS] [^114LJ7rm] [^117GL9VL].

> I should double-check practical dosing and interactions. Low-dose aspirin in the 75–100 mg daily range is standard in trials and guidelines, with 81 mg commonly used in North America; if aspirin is used for secondary prevention in a KTR, this dose range is reasonable. I need to ensure patients avoid concomitant NSAIDs that blunt aspirin's antiplatelet effect; if ibuprofen is required, it should be dosed either at least 30 minutes after aspirin or at least 8 hours before aspirin to minimize interference, and acetaminophen is preferred for analgesia when feasible [^114Ej6yL] [^114ZUnob].

> Let me synthesize a decision framework, but I should confirm each branch. For established CVD, start or continue low-dose aspirin unless there is a clear bleeding contraindication. For primary prevention in a KTR without CVD, routine aspirin is not recommended given neutral KTR outcomes and increased bleeding risk in CKD; reserve for exceptional cases with very high atherothrombotic risk and low bleeding risk after shared decision-making. For peri-procedural planning, generally continue low-dose aspirin for biopsies and most surgeries, holding higher-dose aspirin and dual antiplatelet therapy according to procedural bleeding risk and cardiothoracic input. For pregnancy, initiate aspirin at 12 weeks for preeclampsia prophylaxis unless contraindicated. Throughout, reassess bleeding risk, renal function, anemia, and drug interactions regularly [^1179PC6w] [^114aoceA] [^115UXNwS].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should also address a common pitfall. I initially thought "all transplant recipients should be on aspirin for graft protection", but that overstates the evidence; early small studies suggested reduced early graft thrombosis with perioperative aspirin, yet no modern randomized trials demonstrate sustained graft survival benefit from routine aspirin, and current guidelines emphasize cardiovascular rather than graft-protective indications, so I need to correct that assumption and anchor decisions to cardiovascular indications and bleeding risk rather than graft thrombosis prevention alone [^113Xh5sc] [^1145yE2q] [^114bE669].

> Final take: Yes, many kidney transplant recipients should take low-dose aspirin, but primarily when there is established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease for secondary prevention. For primary prevention, routine aspirin is not advised due to uncertain benefit and higher bleeding risk, except in pregnancy where aspirin is indicated for preeclampsia prophylaxis, and in select high-risk, low-bleeding-risk scenarios after shared decision-making. Always individualize, monitor for bleeding, and coordinate peri-procedural plans with the transplant and cardiology teams [^1179PC6w] [^1165rHJM] [^115JWA3C] [^115UXNwS].

---

Low-dose aspirin is recommended for kidney transplant recipients with established cardiovascular disease for secondary prevention [^1145yE2q], but it is **not routinely recommended for primary prevention** due to increased bleeding risk and lack of proven benefit in this population [^114aoceA] [^114bE669]. Aspirin should be individualized based on bleeding risk, comorbidities, and concomitant medications, and avoided in patients with high bleeding risk or active gastrointestinal ulcers. Routine use for graft protection is **not supported** by current evidence [^114dik4P].

## Indications for aspirin use in kidney transplant recipients

### Secondary cardiovascular prevention

In kidney transplant recipients with established cardiovascular disease (CVD), low-dose aspirin (75–100 mg daily) is **recommended for secondary prevention** [^112WH7j2] to reduce recurrent ischemic events [^1179PC6w]. This aligns with KDIGO 2024 guidelines for CKD patients with established CVD [^112WH7j2] [^1113xgC6].

---

### Primary cardiovascular prevention

Routine aspirin for primary prevention in kidney transplant recipients is **not recommended** because of increased bleeding risk and lack of proven benefit in this population [^1165rHJM] [^1134ftjC]. KDOQI commentary advises aspirin use only when clearly indicated and after careful risk–benefit assessment [^1145yE2q] [^1135CPTf].

---

## Risks and benefits of aspirin therapy in kidney transplant recipients

### Benefits

Potential benefits include **reduced cardiovascular events** — modest reductions in myocardial infarction in CKD patients, including transplant recipients [^114aoceA] [^116EG7JK] — and **possible graft protection**, with limited evidence suggesting reduced early graft thrombosis, though this remains uncertain and is not a standard indication [^113Xh5sc] [^114dik4P].

---

### Risks

Key risks include an **increased bleeding risk**, with higher rates of major and minor bleeding in CKD patients, including transplant recipients [^114aoceA] [^1113xgC6], and **gastrointestinal complications**, such as peptic ulcer disease and gastrointestinal bleeding, which are more common in immunosuppressed patients.

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

| **Guideline/source** | **Recommendation** | **Evidence level** |
|-|-|-|
| KDIGO 2024 | Low-dose aspirin for secondary prevention in CKD patients with established CVD | High |
| KDOQI commentary | Aspirin for primary prevention only after careful risk–benefit assessment | Moderate |
| Cochrane review | Increased bleeding risk with antiplatelet therapy in CKD patients | High |
| UK-HARP study | No significant increase in major bleeding with 100 mg aspirin daily in CKD patients, including transplant recipients | Moderate |

## Patient-specific factors influencing aspirin use

- **Cardiovascular risk profile**: Established CVD, diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia.
- **Bleeding risk**: History of gastrointestinal bleeding, peptic ulcer disease, thrombocytopenia, or concomitant anticoagulant use.
- **Comorbidities**: Active malignancy, liver disease, or uncontrolled hypertension.
- **Concomitant medications**: Immunosuppressive agents, anticoagulants, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).

---

## Clinical scenarios where aspirin use is contraindicated or should be avoided

Aspirin should be avoided or discontinued in the following scenarios:

- **High bleeding risk**: Active gastrointestinal bleeding, peptic ulcer disease, or concomitant anticoagulant therapy.
- **Allergic reactions**: History of hypersensitivity to aspirin or other NSAIDs.
- **Surgical procedures**: Perioperative periods where bleeding risk is elevated, unless specifically indicated for cardiovascular reasons [^112o16u8] [^116Vp4Pv].

---

## Alternative medications and strategies

Alternative medications and strategies include **P2Y12 inhibitors** (clopidogrel, ticagrelor) for patients with aspirin intolerance or contraindications, and **lifestyle modifications** with aggressive risk-factor control — blood pressure, lipid, and diabetes management — as primary strategies for cardiovascular risk reduction [^114N4VZF] [^116dphzF].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular monitoring and follow-up should include assessment for **bleeding** — gastrointestinal bleeding, hematuria, and easy bruising — and periodic evaluation of renal function, blood pressure, and cardiovascular status.

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Secondary prevention**: Recommended for kidney transplant recipients with established CVD [^116qVUxF].
- **Primary prevention**: Not routinely recommended; individualized decision-making required [^115JWA3C].
- **Graft protection**: Not supported by current evidence; routine use not recommended [^114dik4P].
- **Individualized assessment**: Essential to balance cardiovascular benefits against bleeding risks [^1135CPTf].

---

Low-dose aspirin is **beneficial for secondary cardiovascular prevention** in kidney transplant recipients but is not routinely recommended for primary prevention due to increased bleeding risk. Individualized assessment and careful monitoring are essential to optimize outcomes.

Other medications are also important in the management of ARVD. Lipid-lowering drugs are strongly recommended to achieve cholesterol targets appropriate to the level of cardiovascular risk; by definition, ARVD represents a clinical manifestation of atherosclerotic disease and should be considered to pose very high risk. Anti-platelet therapy with at least a low dose of aspirin is also considered as standard care for secondary prevention of cardiovascular events. Additional measures to manage ARVD risk include tobacco cessationand glycemic control. Application of guideline-directed medical treatment was fundamental to the success of "optimized" medical therapy in the CORAL trial.

Revascularization in ARVD

Beginning in the 1960s, surgical revascularization of the kidney became standard therapy for selected patients with identified renovascular hypertension. Numerous series of such patients reported improvement (and occasionally "cure") in hypertension. – With the expansion of endovascular revascularization procedures in the 1980s, percutaneous angioplasty with stent implantation was later widely applied to ARVD, allowing treatment of individuals deemed to be at high surgical risk. Endovascular interventions were developed in parallel with major advances in antihypertensive drug therapy (including RAAS blockade) and medical therapies to treat atherosclerotic disease. As interventional procedures have some risks and are not always effective in older individuals with ARVD, several attempts to characterize their appropriateness have been undertaken.

An alternative strategy in 'high-risk' patients with non- MCP -aHUS is combined kidney–liver transplantation, with the transplanted liver correcting complement dysregulation through production of wild-type complement proteins. However, this procedure is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, with poor outcomes initially reported in children with CFH mutations and life-threatening disease. These have been followed by several successful reports in CFH -aHUS, and one each in CFB -aHUS and combined CFH/CFI -aHUS, using pre- and post-operative TPE, heparin and low-dose aspirin. Guidelines to patient selection for combined liver–kidney transplantation have been published. A single case is reported also of pre-emptive isolated split liver transplant with good graft and native renal function at 2 years.

### Practical issues in clinical scenarios involving CKD patients requiring antithrombotic therapy in light of the 2017 ESC guideline recommendations [^112D6XBn]. BMC Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Patients with advanced CKD/ESRD are at risk of major bleeding due to a number of reasons, with the risk being greatly increased by OAT. Before contemplating DAPT in anticoagulation patients undergoing PCI, careful consideration must be given to the impact on their bleeding risk, which will be significantly enhanced. Even in the general population, the risk of major bleeding with PCI after acute MI is significantly increased with triple therapy. A Danish registry of over 40,000 patients showed an annual hospitalization rate for major bleeding of 2.6–4.3% with either aspirin, clopidogrel, or OAT therapy alone, which increased to 12% with 'triple therapy'.

The main principles of treatment in this complex situation must be to safely use antiplatelet therapy to prevent stent thrombosis whilst avoiding escalation of the bleeding risk. As the antiplatelet efficacy of aspirin is recognized to be less than that of clopidogrel, but its use in combination with clopidogrel and OAT definitely increases major bleeding risk, patients with CKD categories G4, G5, or G5D receiving OAT and requiring PCI should receive single agent antiplatelet therapy, namely clopidogrel (see Figure seven from the ESC Update).

Aspirin for primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) — evidence and bleeding risk: In adults < 40 years of age, there is insufficient evidence to judge the risk–benefit ratio of routine aspirin; although "routine use is not recommended in these settings", there is also insufficient evidence to comment on whether physicians might discuss prophylactic aspirin with adults < 40 years of age or > 70 years of age. As inferred from the first recommendation, there is "no justification for the routine administration of low-dose aspirin" among adults at low estimated ASCVD risk; in the ARRIVE trial the observed average 10-year ASCVD risk was < 10%, and "the overall benefits of prophylactic aspirin by intention-to-treat were negligible". Accumulated data "support avoiding prophylactic aspirin" when bleeding risk factors are present, including "a history of previous gastrointestinal bleeding or peptic ulcer disease or bleeding at other sites, age > 70 years, thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, chronic kidney disease (CKD)", and concurrent use of agents that increase bleeding risk such as "nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, steroids, direct oral anticoagulants, and warfarin".

Anticoagulation in Kidney Transplantation

Guidelines for anticoagulant/antiplatelet treatment in kidney transplant recipients are still lacking, but continuous anticoagulation is necessary because the risk of thrombosis persists. Heparin, low-molecular-weight heparin, and warfarin have been shown to be effective in kidney transplant recipients. Interestingly, unlike dialysis patients, kidney transplant recipients undergoing heparin treatment rarely experienced HIT even if they have a history of HIT. This phenomenon might result from the inhibitory effect of immunosuppressants on the synthesis of HIT antibodies (Figure 6), which indicated that heparin may be safe for kidney transplant recipients. Antiplatelet drugs, including clopidogrel and aspirin, could also be used but is not the first choice because available evidences showed that antiplatelet drugs did not improve graft loss in kidney transplant recipients.

DOACs may not be suitable for kidney transplant recipients because it is cleared by the kidney and has drug interactions with certain immunosuppressants, especially calcineurin inhibitors.

IgA Nephropathy

IgA nephropathy is an autoimmune nephropathy that is manifested by the deposition of IgA immune complexes in the mesangial region of glomeruli. Although the incidence of thrombosis is low, many studies have also found hypercoagulable states in patients with IgA nephropathy.

Despite the higher risk of cardiovascular events in patients with chronic kidney disease, the role of aspirin for primary prevention is unclear. In the current issue, Wolfe et al. present a subgroup analysis of the ASPirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly (ASPREE) trial that suggests there was no reduction in cardiovascular events but bleeding events were doubled. Aspirin cannot be recommended for primary prevention in chronic kidney disease, but the continuation of ongoing research, such as the Aspirin To Target Arterial Events in Chronic Kidney Disease (ATTACK trial), is warranted.

### Kidney transplantation in a patient lacking cytosolic phospholipase AProves renal origins of urinary PGI-M and TX-M [^1175pjZx]. Circulation Research (2018). Low credibility.

In conclusion, we now need to reconsider the many studies and clinical trials that have used measures of PGI-M and TX-M to construct some of the fundamental concepts of eicosanoid biology and to characterize various patient groups. This is particularly important in the areas of aspirin therapy and COX-2 biology where urinary markers have been used to inform discussions on the mechanisms associated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory group of drugs and cardiovascular risk. In the light of our findings, which prove that urinary PGI-M can originate from the kidney, we may conclude that earlier studies showing COX-2 inhibitor drugs to reduce PGI-M simply confirm the kidney as a prime site for constitutive COX-2 expression and add to the idea that blockade of the production of protective COX-2–derived prostanoids in the kidney contributes to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory group of drug–induced cardiovascular side effects.

### KDOQI US commentary on the KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of CKD [^1113xgC6]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Antiplatelet therapy in chronic kidney disease (CKD) — For secondary prevention after established ischemic cardiovascular disease (CVD), Recommendation 3.15.2.1 states, "We recommend oral low-dose aspirin for prevention of recurrent ischemic cardiovascular disease events (i.e., secondary prevention)", and Practice Point 3.15.2.1 advises to "Consider other antiplatelet therapy (e.g. P2Y12 inhibitors) when there is aspirin intolerance". Supporting evidence notes a Cochrane Collaboration meta-analysis in CKD that "may reduce the relative risk of myocardial infarction by 12% (risk ratio, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.79–0.99)" but that "antiplatelet medication use was associated with an expected relative increase in major bleeding (risk ratio, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.10–1.65) and minor bleeding (risk ratio, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.27–1.90)", with "There were no studies analyzed that examined primary prevention" and "there is uncertain effect on risk of stroke and death". KDIGO also "has a class C recommendation for oral low-dose aspirin in the secondary prevention of recurrent ischemic cardiovascular events in persons with CKD based on available clinical trial data".

### Aspirin to target arterial events in chronic kidney disease (ATTACK) [^116EaoJG]. ClinicalTrials (2018). Low credibility.

Study Overview This study aims to find out whether people with chronic kidney disease should take low dose aspirin to reduce the risk of first heart attack or stroke. CKD is common and is associated with an increased risk of CVD. CVD is caused by small blood clots and aspirin thins the blood to reduce the risk of such clots developing but it also increases the risk of bleeding. Aspirin is recommended to prevent further CVD in people who have already had a first CVD event. Here the investigators want to study the use of aspirin as primary prevention in people with CKD who have not had a CVD to prevent the first event, to assess whether the potential benefits exceed the risks. Eligible patients will be recruited from their United Kingdom general practices and allocated by chance to be prescribed once daily low dose aspirin or usual care only.

Follow-up will be for several years both electronically and by annual questionnaires to ascertain CVD and bleeding events. Aim To test the hypothesis that the addition of 75mg aspirin once daily to usual care reduces the risk of major vascular events in patients with chronic kidney disease who do not have pre-existing cardiovascular disease.
- Subjects whose behaviour or lifestyle would render them less likely to comply with study medication
- Subjects in prison
- Subjects currently participating in another clinical trial of an investigational medicinal product or who have taken part in such a trial in the last three months Interventions Suitable participants will be randomised to receive: 75mg non-enteric coated or dispersible aspirin once daily in addition to their usual medication; or no additional treatment and avoidance of aspirin.

Secondary outcome measures Efficacy
- Death from any cause
- Composite outcome of major vascular event or revascularisation
- Individual components of the primary composite endpoint
- Health-related quality of life Safety. -. Subjects with other conditions which in the opinion of their General Practitioner would preclude prescription of aspirin in routine clinical practice, for example significant anaemia or thrombocytopenia
- Subjects who are pregnant or likely to become pregnant during the study period
- Subjects with malignancy that is life-threatening or likely to limit prognosis, other life-threatening co-morbidity, or terminal illness.

KDIGO Chapter 15 — Management of NODAT advises that if NODAT develops, consider modifying the immunosuppressive drug regimen to reverse or ameliorate diabetes after weighing the risk of rejection and other potential adverse effects (Not Graded). It further advises to consider targeting HbA1c 7.0%-7.5% and to avoid targeting HbA1c ≤ 6.0%, especially if hypoglycemic reactions are common (Not Graded). In patients with diabetes, it suggests that aspirin (65–100 mg/d) for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) be based on patient preferences and values, balancing ischemic versus bleeding risks (2D).

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of chronic kidney disease in patients infected with HIV: 2014 update by the HIV Medicine Association of the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^114Ej6yL]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Aspirin therapy to reduce cardiovascular risk in CKD — benefits, risks, and dosing: Aspirin use is associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular disease but with increased risk of major bleeding complications. The US Preventive Services Task Force recommends aspirin for primary prevention in men aged 45–79 and women aged 55–79 when cardiovascular risk exceeds age-adjusted bleeding risk, yet < 20% of HIV-infected patients meeting 2009 USPSTF criteria were prescribed aspirin in one study. In post hoc analyses among 3619 subjects with a GFR < 60 mL/minute/ 1.73 m², aspirin 75 mg/day was associated with fewer cardiovascular events and lower all-cause mortality; for every 1000 persons with a GFR < 45 mL/minute/1.73 m², aspirin was estimated to prevent 76 major cardiovascular events and 54 all-cause deaths while contributing to 27 excess major bleeds, with a tendency toward increased bleeding as GFR declines (P = 0.08). In a randomized placebo-controlled study including CKD patients with ESRD, functioning transplants, and predialysis patients with creatinine ≥ 1.7 mg/dL, aspirin 100 mg/day was associated with a 3-fold higher risk of minor, but not major, bleeding episodes. KDIGO guidelines suggest that adults with CKD at risk for atherosclerotic events be offered antiplatelet agents unless bleeding risk is increased. Across trials, risk reduction was similar for dose ranges 75–162 mg/day compared with higher doses 500–1500 mg/day, and a CKD trial used 75–162 mg/day; doses of 75–100 mg/day were effective in trials of patients with CKD.

### Renal infarction associated with low dose intravenous immunoglobulin in a kidney transplant recipient with sepsis: a case report and literature review [^114PCqc1]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

The patient survived from severe infection, but her grafted kidney was failure. Prevention is the most important because the occurrence of these side effects causes irreversible complications. To reduce the risk of thrombosis when using IVIG, it is essential to identify the risk factors. The daily use of IVIG should be limited to 400–500 mg/kg, and hydration should be considered before and after administration. The use of premedications, such as aspirin or low-molecular-weight heparin, may be considered in high-risk patients if it is not contraindicated to use them. Slow infusion is also effective in preventing thrombosis. The use of a protocol that includes hydration, premedication, and slow infusion in renal transplantation patients reduces the risk of thrombosis. Furthermore, in kidney transplant recipients prone to developing thromboembolic events, proper imaging surveillance should be considered to diagnose renal infarction during suitable times, especially if laboratory or clinical findings show any suspicious findings associated with renal infarction. Doppler ultrasonography or contrast CT should also be performed in patients with high risk of thromboembolic events rather than conventional ultrasonography or non-contrast CT due to their limitations in detecting renal blood flow.

There were inconsistent results regarding the association determined between the use of IVIG and clinical outcomes in septic patients. Although the meta-analysis using high quality trials alone did not show a significant effect on survival, the meta-analysis using all randomized trials showed a reduction in mortality. A recent trial has shown that high-dose IVIG (1.5–2.0 g/kg) is associated with favorable outcomes. Considering these, the current guidelines state that the use of IVIG in septic patients is supported by weak recommendations or weak evidence. However, the use of IVIG can be considered in septic patients who are also immunodeficient. In our study, the patient received three immunosuppressants and could not withdraw any of her medications. Although these medications preferentially work on T-cells, previous studies have shown that they can directly or indirectly attenuate humoral immunity. There were few data regarding the efficacy of IVIG in septic patients who were kidney transplant recipients; the patient would have an acquired immunodeficient status compared to the general population. Our case shows that IVIG can be considered as a possible option of treatment in septic patients.

In conclusion, infarction of transplant kidney can be caused by IVIG use in a patient with sepsis, even with low-dose administration. Transplant kidney may be more susceptible to thromboembolic events following IVIG use. Thus, when using IVIG for kidney transplant patients with high risk of thromboembolic events, we may be careful to prevent the thromboembolic events.

### Effects of aspirin on cardiovascular outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease [^116EiYhf]. Kidney International (2023). Medium credibility.

Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) carry a high cardiovascular (CV) risk. Since whether this risk is reduced by aspirin is unclear, we examined if the effect of aspirin on cardiovascular outcomes varied by baseline kidney function in a primary cardiovascular disease prevention trial. The International Polycap Study-3 (TIPS-3) trial had randomized people without previous cardiovascular disease to aspirin (75 mg daily) or placebo. We now examined aspirin versus placebo on cardiovascular events in participants grouped by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), using a threshold of 60 ml/min/1.73 m², and by using tertiles of eGFR. The primary outcome was a composite of non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke or cardiovascular death. A total of 5712 participants were randomized with a mean follow-up of 4.6 years. Of these, 983 (17.2%) had an eGFR under 60 ml/min/1.73 m² (mean eGFR 49 ml/min/1.73 m²) and 4,729 over 60 ml/min/1.73 m² (mean 84 ml/min/1.73 m²). In participants with an eGFR under 60 ml/min/1.73 m² there were 26 primary outcomes in 502 participants on aspirin and 39/481 on placebo (hazard ratio 0.57; 95% confidence interval 0.34–0.94). In participants with an eGFR over 60 ml/min/1.73 m² there were 90 primary outcomes in 2357 participants on aspirin and 95/2372 on placebo (0.95; 0.71–1.27). With tertiles of eGFR under 70, 70–90, and over 90 ml/min/1.73 m², risk reductions with aspirin for the primary outcome were larger at lower eGFR levels (0.62; 0.43–0.91) for the lowest tertile, (0.96; 0.62–1.49) for the middle, and (1.30; 0.77–2.18) for the highest tertile. Thus, our findings support aspirin may reduce cardiovascular events in people with moderate to advanced stage CKD.

### Antiplatelet agents for chronic kidney disease [^114aoceA]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Antiplatelet agents are widely used to prevent cardiovascular events. The risks and benefits of antiplatelet agents may be different in people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) for whom occlusive atherosclerotic events are less prevalent, and bleeding hazards might be increased. This is an update of a review first published in 2013.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of antiplatelet agents in people with any form of CKD, including those with CKD not receiving renal replacement therapy, patients receiving any form of dialysis, and kidney transplant recipients.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 13 July 2021 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Selection Criteria

We selected randomised controlled trials of any antiplatelet agents versus placebo or no treatment, or direct head-to-head antiplatelet agent studies in people with CKD. Studies were included if they enrolled participants with CKD, or included people in broader at-risk populations in which data for subgroups with CKD could be disaggregated.

Data Collection and Analysis

Four authors independently extracted data from primary study reports and any available supplementary information for study population, interventions, outcomes, and risks of bias. Risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated from numbers of events and numbers of participants at risk which were extracted from each included study. The reported RRs were extracted where crude event rates were not provided. Data were pooled using the random-effects model. Confidence in the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.

Main Results

We included 113 studies, enrolling 51,959 participants; 90 studies (40,597 CKD participants) compared an antiplatelet agent with placebo or no treatment, and 29 studies (11,805 CKD participants) directly compared one antiplatelet agent with another. Fifty-six new studies were added to this 2021 update. Seven studies originally excluded from the 2013 review were included, although they had a follow-up lower than two months. Random sequence generation and allocation concealment were at low risk of bias in 16 and 22 studies, respectively. Sixty-four studies reported low-risk methods for blinding of participants and investigators; outcome assessment was blinded in 41 studies. Forty-one studies were at low risk of attrition bias, 50 studies were at low risk of selective reporting bias, and 57 studies were at low risk of other potential sources of bias. Compared to placebo or no treatment, antiplatelet agents probably reduces myocardial infarction (18 studies, 15,289 participants: RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.99, I² = 0%; moderate certainty). Antiplatelet agents has uncertain effects on fatal or nonfatal stroke (12 studies, 10.382 participants: RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.59, I² = 37%; very low certainty) and may have little or no effect on death from any cause (35 studies, 18,241 participants: RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.06, I² = 14%; low certainty). Antiplatelet therapy probably increases major bleeding in people with CKD and those treated with haemodialysis (HD) (29 studies, 16,194 participants: RR 1.35, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.65, I² = 12%; moderate certainty). In addition, antiplatelet therapy may increase minor bleeding in people with CKD and those treated with HD (21 studies, 13,218 participants: RR 1.55, 95% CI 1.27 to 1.90, I² = 58%; low certainty). Antiplatelet treatment may reduce early dialysis vascular access thrombosis (8 studies, 1525 participants) RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.70; low certainty). Antiplatelet agents may reduce doubling of serum creatinine in CKD (3 studies, 217 participants: RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.86, I² = 8%; low certainty). The treatment effects of antiplatelet agents on stroke, cardiovascular death, kidney failure, kidney transplant graft loss, transplant rejection, creatinine clearance, proteinuria, dialysis access failure, loss of primary unassisted patency, failure to attain suitability for dialysis, need of intervention and cardiovascular hospitalisation were uncertain. Limited data were available for direct head-to-head comparisons of antiplatelet drugs, including prasugrel, ticagrelor, different doses of clopidogrel, abciximab, defibrotide, sarpogrelate and beraprost.

Authors' Conclusions

Antiplatelet agents probably reduced myocardial infarction and increased major bleeding, but do not appear to reduce all-cause and cardiovascular death among people with CKD and those treated with dialysis. The treatment effects of antiplatelet agents compared with each other are uncertain.

### Effect of antiplatelet therapy on cardiovascular and kidney outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112qjxdB]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

This review suggested that antiplatelet therapy might reduce the occurrence of major cardiovascular events and hemodialysis vascular access failure in CKD patients compared with placebo or usual-care groups. However, the significantly increased risk of bleeding should be considered. Although there is seemingly a net benefit of using antiplatelet therapy for CKD patients, complete evaluation and careful monitoring should permeate the whole therapy process. Physicians should weigh the tradeoff between benefits and risks of bleeding individually. Further antiplatelet studies are warranted to confirm and integrate these results for CKD patients.

### 2024 guideline for the primary prevention of stroke: a guideline from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^1165V1aG]. Stroke (2024). High credibility.

Antiplatelet use for primary prevention — Recommendations include: In patients with diabetes or other common vascular risk factors and no prior stroke, the use of aspirin to prevent a first stroke is not well established (Class of Recommendation [COR] 2b; Level of Evidence [LOE] A). In patients with established, stable coronary artery disease and a low bleeding risk, the addition of ticagrelor to aspirin beyond 12 months for a period up to 3 years may be beneficial to reduce the rate of ischemic stroke (COR 2b; LOE B-R). In individuals ≥ 70 years of age with at least 1 additional cardiovascular risk factor, the use of aspirin is not beneficial to prevent a first stroke (COR 3: No Benefit; LOE A). In patients with chronic kidney disease, the use of aspirin is not effective to prevent a first stroke (COR 3: No Benefit; LOE B-NR).

### Primary prevention aspirin, lipoprotein (a), and cardiorenal outcomes in chronic kidney disease: chronic renal insufficiency cohort [^111SJoqE]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Aspirin use was associated with a significantly lower risk of MI and ESRD among individuals with CKD without clinical CVD who had Lp(a) ≥ 50 mg/dL. Aspirin use did not significantly associate with a lower risk of CVD or renal outcomes among those with Lp(a) < 50 mg/dL. Furthermore, there was no significant increase in major bleeding events with aspirin use in either Lp(a) group, though this observational study is not able to fully account for aspirin prescribing practices according to baseline bleeding risk. In summary, individuals with CKD and elevated Lp(a) without clinical CVD may derive net clinical benefit from low-dose aspirin for the primary prevention of MI and ESRD. Further risk-benefit discussions and robust investigations involving the role of aspirin therapy in primary prevention among individuals with CKD are required.

Perspectives

COMPETENCY IN MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE: In the first study to assess the role of aspirin according to Lp(a) level among individuals with CKD without clinical CVD, aspirin use was associated with a 38% and 28% lower risk of MI and ESRD for individuals with Lp(a) ≥ 50 but not < 50 mg/dL. Aspirin use was not significantly associated with stroke or major bleeding in either Lp(a) group.

TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: These results underline a need to perform randomized clinical trials assessing the role of primary prevention aspirin for individuals with CKD according to Lp(a) level.

### Clinical practice guideline on pregnancy and renal disease [^115Usiy6]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Women with CKD should have specialist care of kidney disease in pregnancy, in addition to routine antenatal care. This means that they will be seen by doctors (obstetricians) as well as midwives during their pregnancy, and they will have extra scans to check the growth and wellbeing of their baby. Many women with CKD will need treatment for their blood pressure in pregnancy and a number of different blood pressure medications are safe including labetalol, nifedipine, methyldopa. Pregnant women with CKD may need iron (which can be given by injection), and vitamin D. If women were taking erythropoietin ('Epo') before conceiving then the dose will need to be increased in pregnancy. Women with CKD, including women with renal transplants, can have a vaginal delivery. They can also breastfeed if they wish and can be given medications that are safe in breastfeeding if they need them.

Compared with women without CKD, women with CKD have a higher risk of a condition called pre-eclampsia. This condition only occurs in pregnancy and goes away after delivery. It causes high blood pressure, protein leak into the urine, headaches and abnormal blood tests. It can also affect the growth of the baby. It can be difficult to know if a woman with CKD has pre-eclampsia if she had high blood pressure and protein in her urine before pregnancy, and specialists should be available to help with diagnosis and treatment. If a woman develops pre-eclampsia, she will need close monitoring and she may need to deliver her baby early. All women with CKD should take low-dose aspirin in pregnancy. This is safe and reduces the risk of pre-eclampsia.

Women with kidney transplants, lupus and diabetes can have successful pregnancies. Timing of pregnancy in these conditions is particularly important in order to make sure kidney function is stable, and that lupus and diabetes are well controlled before pregnancy, in order to have the best chance of a healthy baby. Women who have congenital kidney disease and women who have had bladder surgery should have specialist advice on the best way to deliver their baby. Pregnancy while on dialysis has a very high risk of complications. Although the number of hours of dialysis can be increased in pregnancy, pregnancy outcomes are better for most women on dialysis if they can delay pregnancy until after successful kidney transplantation.

### KDIGO clinical practice guideline on the evaluation and management of candidates for kidney transplantation [^114226xv]. Transplantation (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for kidney transplantation, more specifically with respect to management of antithrombotics, KDIGO 2020 guidelines recommend to stop antiplatelet agents (except aspirin) 5 days before living donor transplantation (unless cessation is contraindicated) and during the perioperative period for deceased donor transplantation.

### Azathioprine [^116p7LfB]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE:

Azathioprine is indicated as an adjunct for the prevention of rejection in renal homotransplantation. It is also indicated for the management of active rheumatoid arthritis to reduce signs and symptoms.

Renal Homotransplantation: Azathioprine Tablets are indicated as an adjunct for the prevention of rejection in renal homotransplantation. Experience with over 16,000 transplants shows a 5-year patient survival of 35% to 55%, but this is dependent on donor, match for HLA antigens, anti-donor or anti-B-cell alloantigen antibody, and other variables. The effect of azathioprine on these variables has not been tested in controlled trials.

Rheumatoid Arthritis: Azathioprine Tablets are indicated for the treatment of active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) to reduce signs and symptoms. Aspirin, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and/or low dose glucocorticoids may be continued during treatment with Azathioprine Tablets. The combined use of azathioprine with disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) has not been studied for either added benefit or unexpected adverse effects. The use of Azathioprine Tablets with these agents cannot be recommended.

### Effect of antiplatelet therapy on cardiovascular and kidney outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111wJ14i]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is recognized as a major public health problem. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality for CKD patients. The association between prevalent CVD and the risk of progression of CKD has been demonstrated by large population-based cohort studies. Management of multiple cardiovascular risk factors, such as improved blood pressure and diabetes control, not only protects from cardiovascular disease, but also delays CKD progression. In patients with occlusive vascular disease, antiplatelet therapy reduced the yearly risk of major cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, stroke, and vascular death, by about 25%. The different etiological pathways of CVD, pathophysiology, and abnormal platelet function have resulted in substantial uncertainty concerning the risks and benefits of antiplatelet therapy in patients with CKD.

In addition to providing cardiovascular protection, another role of antiplatelet therapy is presumed to prevent dialysis vascular access thrombosis and improve fistula or graft function in populations on or nearing commencement of hemodialysis therapy. Some random control trials (RCTs) involving a CKD population showed that more intensive platelets inhibition could be of reduced benefit in preventing major cardiovascular events and dialysis vascular access failure, whereas others suggested benefits of similar or even greater magnitude. Given these uncertainties, patients with CKD have been shown to be less likely to be prescribed antiplatelet drugs, even after acute myocardial infarction. Thus, the issue of whether these beneficial effects could be outweighed by the increased bleeding hazards remains inconclusive and controversial. It is difficult for clinicians to interpret these results when counseling patients with CKD about antiplatelet therapy.

In this systematic review, our aim was to summarize all the available clinical trial data and evaluate the benefits and side effects of antiplatelet therapy in preventing major cardiovascular events, all-deaths, dialysis vascular access failure, and kidney outcome in patients with CKD.

### Influence of aspirin on early allograft thrombosis and chronic allograft nephropathy following renal transplantation [^113Xh5sc]. The British Journal of Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Primary thrombosis and chronic allograft nephropathy are important causes of early and late graft loss, respectively, following renal transplantation. This study examined the potential for aspirin therapy to reduce these complications.

Methods

A consecutive series of 105 cadaveric renal transplants treated with aspirin 150 mg daily for the first 3 months after transplantation was compared with an untreated historical control group (n = 121). Protocol needle-core biopsies were performed on all transplants in both groups at 1 week and 12 months after transplantation. Needle-core allograft biopsies were performed at 3, 6 and 12 months after transplantation, and serum creatinine was measured at each outpatient attendance for the duration of follow-up.

Results

There was a significantly lower rate of primary allograft thrombosis in patients treated with aspirin (none of 105) compared with that in the control group (six (5 per cent) of 121; P = 0.03). There were no differences in renal function or 2-year allograft survival between the two groups. Aspirin-treated patients had a lower incidence of chronic allograft nephropathy at 1 year than controls although this did not reach statistical significance (16 versus 26 per cent; P = 0.075). There were no major bleeding complications in either group in association with peptic ulcer disease or following renal transplant biopsy.

Conclusion

Aspirin reduced the rate of early graft thrombosis of renal transplants in this series but did not improve renal function or graft survival. A trend towards a lower rate of chronic allograft nephropathy was noted with aspirin treatment. These findings require confirmation in a prospective randomized trial.

### Renal association clinical practice guideline in post-operative care in the kidney transplant recipient [^114LJ7rm]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Guideline 11.2 – KTR: conception and contraception (female)

We suggest:
KTRs should wait for 1 year after transplant and have stable function before attempting conception (2C)
Counselling regarding fertility and reproduction should be offered to female KTRs and their partners either prior to transplantation or soon afterwards (2D)
m-TORi should be stopped prior to conception and replaced as appropriate (2D)
Pregnancy should be managed jointly with an Obstetrics department with experience of care of KTRs (2D)
We suggest that KTRs receive aspirin 75 mg daily to reduce the risk of pre-eclampsia from 12 weeks gestation until birth of the baby unless there are contraindications (2C)
The risks and benefits of breastfeeding should be discussed (2D)
Contraception advice should be similar to the general population (2D)

Guideline 11.3 – KTR: conception and contraception (male)

We recommend:
Male KTRs are advised that MPA containing compounds have theoretical teratogenic potential in men taking these agents (1D)
KTRs should be advised that m-TORi reduce the male sperm count and counselled accordingly (1C)

Guideline 11.4 – KTR: conception and contraception (male)

We suggest:
All immunosuppressive drugs other than m-TORi can be used in male KTRs. Advice for MPA is as Guideline 11.3 (2D)
The decision to continue MPA containing compounds in a male KTR wishing to conceive should balance a the risk of theoretical teratogenicity against the risk of rejection on changing from MPA to azathioprine (2D)
Men on m-TORi who wish to conceive should discontinue these agents prior to conception and replace them as appropriate (2D)
Men who wish to maintain fertility should avoid m-TORi or bank sperm prior to starting these drugs (2D)

Audit Measure

Pregnancy rates and outcomes should be monitored

### Ticlopidine and clopidogrel, sometimes combined with aspirin, only minimally increase the surgical risk in renal transplantation: a case-control study [^115vTVJ5]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Patients undergoing kidney transplantation are sometimes being treated with antiplatelet agents such as ticlopidine or clopidogrel. Some teams refuse to wait-list these patients for fear of bleeding during transplant surgery.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed the records of 702 adult patients with a kidney transplant alone between 2000 and 2010. Nineteen (2.7%) patients were taking clopidogrel or ticlopidine when called in for transplantation. Furthermore, 10 of these 19 patients were also taking low-dose aspirin (ASA). We compared the risk of bleeding peri- and postoperatively, and the occurrence of cardiovascular complications within 30 days after renal transplantation between 19 cases and 39 controls randomly selected within the cohort.

Results

Platelets were administered to 7 cases (37%) versus 0 controls (P < 0.001). A single case (5.3%) presented with significant bleeding during surgery following an implantation biopsy, and required 4 red bood cell (RBC) units. During the first day, 3 of the 19 cases (16%) and 1 of the 39 controls required RBC (P = 0.1). No reoperation was performed for bleeding. After the transplant, clopidogrel or ticlopidine was resumed in only two patients. The platelet count and haemoglobin were similar between cases and controls at Day 30. No cardiovascular event occurred in cases or controls during the first month post-transplantation. At 5 years, graft and patient survival was similar in cases and controls.

Conclusions

Clopidogrel and ticlopidine, sometimes in combination with ASA, are associated with a low risk of bleeding during renal transplantation and does not seem to be a contraindication for renal transplant surgery.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of chronic kidney disease in patients infected with HIV: 2014 update by the HIV Medicine Association of the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^1169Lwd7]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Statin selection and aspirin considerations in antiretroviral therapy (ART)–treated patients — Statins have important drug–drug interactions with protease inhibitors and other drugs that are metabolized by the CYP3A system and pose an increased risk of myopathy, and among the currently available statins, atorvastatin, fluvastatin (except with nelfinavir), pitavastatin, pravastatin (except with darunavir), and rosuvastatin are acceptable options in ART-treated patients with appropriate dosing and monitoring. It is not clear that statins are beneficial in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and kidney disease may increase the risk of bleeding with aspirin.

### Early and late effects of low-dose aspirin on renal function in elderly patients [^113fCqZ1]. The American Journal of Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Although low-dose aspirin is used by many elderly patients, monitoring of renal function is currently not recommended. We recently reported transient retention of uric acid and creatinine caused by aspirin in doses of 75 to 325 mg/d. We therefore evaluated the renal effects of aspirin (100 mg/d), including post-treatment effects.

Methods

We studied 83 stable geriatric patients in long-term care (aged 56 to 98 years) who were treated with low-dose aspirin (100 mg/d) for 2 weeks and 40 control patients. Other medications and diet were kept constant. Biochemical monitoring including blood samples and 24-hour urinary collections for creatinine and uric acid at baseline and weekly for a total of 5 weeks.

Results

After 2 weeks on aspirin, urinary excretion of creatinine decreased in 60 (72%) and excretion of uric acid decreased in 54 (65%) of the 83 patients, and their mean clearances decreased; during the same period, serum blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and uric acid levels increased (P < 0.05 for all). Deterioration from baseline levels was significantly greater (and more prevalent) in the aspirin-treated group than in the 40 control patients (P = 0.001 to 0.09). After withdrawal of aspirin these parameters improved. However, 3 weeks after stopping aspirin, 48% (35 of the 73 in whom this measurement was available) had a persistent decline in creatinine clearance from baseline, as compared with only 8% (3/36) controls (P < 0.001).

Conclusion

Short-term low-dose aspirin treatment may affect renal function in elderly patients. These effects persist 3 weeks after cessation of the drug in some of these patients.

### U.S. centers for disease control and prevention launches new chronic kidney disease surveillance system website [^1133V6Gy]. BMC Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Resource for general public, patients and health providers

The information on the website is available to everyone with the expectation that it will become an essential resource on CKD. The website is designed to be user-friendly and easy-to-navigate for the general public. The information on the site is presented in a number of different formats including maps, figures, charts, summaries, and videos. The CDC, in addition, creates and disseminates a consensus document, the National CKD Fact Sheet, which provides a concise overview on the burden of CKD. Although much of the information may be useful to the general public, a large portion of the material is especially relevant to patients with CKD and their health care providers. For example, there is a section dedicated to describing the burden of established risk factors among patients with CKD. Patients and their providers may also find the health consequences indicator germane, as it addresses some of the more common comorbidities associated with advanced CKD. Risk factor modification and the potential health consequences of chronic kidney disease are two fundamental areas of CKD education, and physicians, particularly primary care providers and nephrologists, should be well versed in these data to have informed discussions with their patients. The information on the website, however, may serve as a reliable adjunct to the patient education that usually takes place in the office or at the bedside. The site also has videos that deal with important topics in kidney disease. For example, one of the featured videos pertains to the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (many of them available over the counter in the United States) — a practice that should be avoided in patients with CKD (with the notable exception of aspirin for cardiovascular disease protection). Unfortunately, a significant number of patients continue to take these medications because they may be unaware of the damaging consequences, or their physicians overlooked their kidney disease. The website also contains information pertinent to special populations, namely children and solid organ transplant recipients with chronic kidney disease. Health care providers and policy makers may find the content on the processes to improve quality and delivery of care particularly significant. In creating this surveillance system, the CDC and their collaborators envisioned that it would lead to measurable improvement in the burden of CKD and quality of CKD care. The surveillance website while inclusive is not the only resource for important CKD information for patients and health care providers. The American Board of Internal Medicine in partnership with Consumer Reports recently invited a number of medical societies including the American Society of Nephrology to identify "Five Things to Question" as part of their Choosing Wisely initiative. These five questions pertain to test and procedures that are commonly done in patients with CKD, which may be unnecessary or potentially harmful and should be preceded by a thorough risk benefit discussion with the patient and their family. For example, the common practice of using peripherally inserted central catheters in patients with CKD could lead to difficulty with appropriate vascular access creation for hemodialysis when necessary, and should largely be discouraged.

### Concomitant use of ibuprofen and aspirin… [^114ZUnob]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Science Paper 9/8/2006 Concomitant Use of Ibuprofen and Aspirin: Potential for Attenuation of the Anti- Platelet Effect of Aspirin Healthcare professionals should be aware of an interaction between low dose aspirin and ibuprofen which might render aspirin less effective when used for its. anti-platelet cardioprotective effect. Healthcare professionals should advise consumers and patients regarding the appropriate concomitant use of ibuprofen and aspirin. Summary
- Existing data using platelet function tests suggest there is a pharmacodynamic interaction between 400mg ibuprofen and low dose aspirin when they are dosed. concomitantly. The FDA is unaware of data addressing whether taking less than 400 mg of ibuprofen interferes with the antiplatelet effect of low dose aspirin.
- The clinical implication of this interaction may be important because the cardioprotective effect of aspirin, when used for secondary prevention of.

- Patients taking immediate release low-dose aspirin and ibuprofen 400mg should take the ibuprofen at least 30 minutes after aspirin ingestion, or at least 8 hours before aspirin ingestion to avoid any potential interaction.
- Other nonselective OTC NSAIDs should be viewed as having potential to interfere with the antiplatelet effect of low-dose aspirin unless proven otherwise.
- Analgesics that do not interfere with the antiplatelet effect of low dose aspirin should be considered for populations at high risk for cardiovascular events. acid, and thereby prevent thromboxane-induced platelet aggregation. Aspirin has an irreversible anti-platelet effect, while other NSAIDs, including ibuprofen, have a reversible anti-platelet effect. 5 Low dose aspirin is effective in the secondary prevention of cardiovascular events because of its antiplatelet effect. Because they bind at similar. aspirin-induced inhibition of thromboxane, when measured as TXB2 production ex vivo.

7 How can the data regarding the interaction between aspirin and ibuprofen from the single and multiple dose studies be interpreted. It thus appears that taking low-dose immediate release aspirin at least 30 minutes before ibuprofen will preserve the anti-platelet effect of aspirin. the cardiovascular event clinical outcome of concomitant dosing has been equivocal. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.

### Primary prevention aspirin, lipoprotein (a), and cardiorenal outcomes in chronic kidney disease: chronic renal insufficiency cohort [^112u8ACf]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Assessment of cardiovascular, renal, and major bleeding outcomes

All participants self-reported the absence of clinical CVD at baseline using medical history questionnaires. Incident cardiovascular and renal outcomes in CRIC were adjudicated by 2 independent physicians. Incident myocardial infarction (MI) was identified based on symptoms, cardiac biomarkers, and/or electrocardiogram evidence of ischemia. Ischemic stroke was defined as a sudden onset of 1 major or 2 minor neurologic symptoms within a cerebrovascular distribution lasting for ≥ 1 day or until the patient died, without identifiable hemorrhage on imaging performed within 1 day of onset. Progression to ESRD was defined by initiation of chronic maintenance dialysis or kidney transplant, determined via self-report, medical record review, and participant records in the United States Renal Data System. Major bleeding events were defined using the International Classification Diagnosis 10th revision and 9th revision codes (Supplemental Table 1). Similar to prior work, we assessed 2 definitions of major bleeding, including the modified Food and Drug Administration (FDA) definition and the Cunningham definition. In brief, the FDA definition considers the first three positions on the discharge summary as a primary bleeding definition, whereas the Cunningham definition considers a major bleeding event only in the first position on the discharge summary.

### Impaired P2Y12 inhibition by clopidogrel in kidney transplant recipients: results from a cohort study [^115YH1eM]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) portends an increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Moreover, a decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR) has been associated with unfavourable clinical outcomes in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), possibly because of endothelial dysfunction and platelet activation. Dual anti-platelet therapy with aspirin and P2Y12 receptor antagonists (including clopidogrel) is currently considered as a key strategy to reduce platelet reactivity and to prevent thrombotic complications following PCI. However, the clinical utility of clopidogrel may be hampered by the high inter-individual variability of inhibition of P2Y12-dependent platelet function. Accordingly, an elevated on-clopidogrel platelet reactivity (HPR) to adenosine diphosphate is a well-known risk factor for adverse events (especially stent thrombosis) following PCI. In CKD patients, a significant and detrimental relationship between the severity of renal impairment and the extent of P2Y12 inhibition has been reported. Cardiovascular complications represent a major cause of morbidity and mortality for CKD patients undergoing kidney transplantation (KT). Notably, a previous investigation reported an association of clopidogrel use with a higher mortality risk, although caution should be exercised as it was an observational study with some data missing. An increased platelet activation caused by calcineurin inhibitors has been advocated to explain the increased atherothrombotic risk observed in renal allograft recipients. However, the impact of KT and chronic immunosuppression on platelet response to clopidogrel in CKD patients undergoing coronary or peripheral revascularization procedures remains unclear. We therefore designed the current cohort study in order to compare platelet responsiveness to clopidogrel [as assessed by vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) phosphorylation] in KT recipients and non-transplanted CKD patients.

Antithrombotic therapy following PTRA

The type and duration of antithrombotic therapy after renal artery PTRA has not been studied in specific RCTs. In the aforementioned trials comparing PTRA with stenting to medical treatment, different types of antithrombotics were used in most (but not all) patients included in the intervention arm, such as low-dose aspirin monotherapy or combinations of low-dose aspirin with clopidogrel or ticagrelor. One observational study reported a trend towards fewer secondary procedures for revascularization failure if the initial stenting was followed by dual antiplatelet therapy. Of note, the various stent devices (bare metal, drug eluting etc.) require different types and duration of antiplatelet treatment and the majority of patients with ARVD have additional atherosclerotic lesions on other vascular beds (coronary, carotid or peripheral arteries) that could have been previously treated with intravascular or open surgical procedures and require antithrombotic therapy. In the absence of trials directly assessing the effects of dual versus single antiplatelet therapy after renal PTRA with stenting, antithrombotic therapy should be chosen in collaboration of the interventionists and the treating nephrologists and cardiologists on an individualized basis, taking into account all the patient's comorbidities, as well as the thrombotic and bleeding risk. In everyday clinical practice, a combination of clopidogrel and low-dose aspirin is empirically prescribed in most centres, typically from 1 to 3 months, prolonged in some cases up to 1 year, after which single antiplatelet therapy is used.

### Society for Maternal-fetal Medicine consult series # 66: prepregnancy evaluation and pregnancy management of patients with solid organ transplants [^115UXNwS]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). Medium credibility.

The rate of solid organ transplant in reproductive-aged patients has increased in the past 3 decades. Concurrently, the range of medical immunosuppressive agents has increased, making it safer for reproductive-aged individuals who have received transplants to attempt and continue a pregnancy. In this Consult, we review the general considerations and contemporary approach to medical and obstetrical management of pregnant solid organ transplant recipients, discuss the perinatal outcomes and incidence of graft rejection specific to the most common types of organ transplants, and provide management recommendations based on the available evidence. The following are Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine recommendations: (1) we recommend that all solid organ transplant recipients capable of pregnancy be offered prepregnancy counseling as part of the pretransplant evaluation and before any posttransplant pregnancy (Best Practice); (2) we recommend deferring pregnancy for at least 1 year (except for lung transplant recipients in which case a 2-year deferral is recommended) following solid organ transplant or any episode of acute cellular rejection (GRADE 1B); (3) we recommend that solid organ transplant recipients have stable allograft function and optimal control of chronic medical comorbidities before attempting pregnancy (GRADE 1B); (4) we recommend that solid organ transplant recipients of reproductive age use highly effective contraception when on mycophenolate or other immunosuppressive agents with known teratogenic risk (GRADE 1A); (5) we recommend that solid organ transplant recipients contemplating pregnancy transition to an appropriate immunosuppressive regimen before attempting pregnancy to establish stable medication dosing and allograft function (GRADE 1C); (6) we recommend close monitoring of serum drug levels during pregnancy and the postpartum period to guide immunosuppressive therapy dosing (GRADE 1C); (7) we recommend that solid organ transplant recipients who are pregnant or contemplating pregnancy receive all indicated vaccinations before and during pregnancy (GRADE 1C); (8) given the risk of fetal and neonatal sequelae secondary to cytomegalovirus infection in pregnancy, we suggest that solid organ transplant recipients ideally complete any indicated antiviral prophylaxis or treatment before pursuing pregnancy (GRADE 2B); (9) we recommend daily low-dose aspirin prophylaxis to reduce the risk for preeclampsia in pregnant solid organ transplant recipients and to reduce the risk for renal allograft failure in renal transplant recipients (GRADE 1C); (10) as for all pregnant people, we recommend that pregnant solid organ transplant recipients have access to mental health specialists and receive screening for depression during pregnancy and the postpartum period (Best Practice); (11) because of the increased incidence of fetal growth restriction and common coexisting medical morbidities, we recommend serial assessment of fetal growth every 4 to 6 weeks throughout gestation after the anatomic survey (GRADE 1C); (12) we suggest antenatal surveillance from 32 weeks of gestation unless other fetal or maternal factors are identified in which case initiation of surveillance at an earlier gestational age is indicated (GRADE 2C); (13) we recommend that renal function be assessed before pregnancy or in early pregnancy in all solid organ transplant recipients (kidney and non-kidney) (GRADE 1C); (14) we suggest individualized delivery timing for pregnant solid organ transplant recipients and to consider delivery at between 37+0/7 and 39+6/7 weeks of gestation; in the absence of other indications, we suggest delivery by 39+6/7 weeks gestation for pregnant solid organ transplant recipients (GRADE 2B); (15) given that a trial of labor is associated with a high success rate and lower neonatal morbidity without increasing maternal morbidity or compromising graft survival, we recommend that cesarean delivery be reserved for medical obstetrical indications in solid organ transplant recipients (GRADE 1C); (16) we recommend that blood pressure targets in pregnant renal transplant recipients with chronic hypertension follow guidelines for nonpregnant recipients with a target blood pressure of ≤ 130/80 mm Hg (GRADE 1C); (17) we recommend monthly urine cultures to screen for asymptomatic bacteriuria with treatment if positive to protect the graft in pregnant renal transplant recipients (GRADE 1C); (18) we recommend that pregnancies in pancreas-kidney transplant recipients be managed in a similar way as those of renal transplant recipients alone (GRADE 1C); (19) we recommend characterizing the underlying condition that led to liver transplantation and assessing baseline renal function in pregnant liver transplant recipients. (GRADE 1C); (20) because of the cardiovascular demand of pregnancy and the unique physiological implications of cardiac transplantation, we recommend that pregnant heart transplant recipients receive multidisciplinary care with cardiology, cardiac and/or obstetrical anesthesiology, and maternal-fetal medicine specialists (Best Practice); and (21) we recommend careful delivery planning to minimize hemodynamic stress (including considering operative vaginal delivery to minimize Valsalva) and suggest continuous intrapartum or intraoperative electrocardiographic monitoring for heart transplant recipients (GRADE 1C).

KDOQI rationale and commentary — The risk of cardiovascular mortality in KTRs is several-fold higher than in the general population, especially in younger age groups and patients with decreasing allograft function, and cardiovascular disease is a major cause of graft loss after the first posttransplant year. In this context, the authors strongly agree that CVD should be managed in KTRs at least as intensively as in the general population, and the working group agreed with the use of low-dose aspirin in KTRs with evidence of atherosclerosis.

Immunosuppression and medications

A comparison of immunosuppression and medication use for both time points is shown in Table 2. At 12 months, patients were generally on lower mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) doses and lower average prednisolone use compared to 6 months. Calcineurin-inhibitor use was no different with most patients on tacrolimus. As calcineurin-inhibitor doses were targeted to levels, the actual dosage carries little meaning and was not examined. Plasma exchange and IVIG use were less frequent at 12 months compared to 6 months. Our centre does not use anti-thymocyte globulin or rituximab for induction therapy. We use an interleukin-2 receptor antibody (basiliximab) for induction in high immunological risk patients. Basiliximab effects are not expected to last 6 months.

Use of prophylactic medications (proton pump inhibitor, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and valganciclovir) reduced from 6 to 12 months, consistent with practice guidelines. Use of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors increased slightly at 12 months but remained < 20% overall. A quarter of patients received antiplatelet agents, mostly with aspirin as a single agent. Less than 5% were on anticoagulants, which were similar at both times. There was low use of supplemental iron and B12 injections were limited to those with documented low B12.

ATHEROSCLEROTIC RENOVASCULAR DISEASE (ARVD)

While the Angioplasty and Stenting for Renal Artery Lesions (ASTRAL)and Cardiovascular Outcomes in Renal Atherosclerotic Lesions (CORAL)trials failed to demonstrate benefits of renal artery stenting with respect to the key outcomes of kidney function, cardiovascular events, and mortality, at least in CORAL a consistent modest difference in systolic BP favoring the stent group was found. However, as a result, the medical community is now reluctant to contemplate revascularization for ARVD. Optimal medical therapy is therefore paramount, as is consideration of remaining uncertainty regarding revascularization.

What is the optimal medical therapy for patients with ARVD?

Patients with ARVD usually have polyvascular disease, and many are first identified during investigation of nonrenal vascular disease, including aortic, coronary, cerebral, and PAD, and heart failure. After an ARVD diagnosis, rates of vascular events are high, and annual mortality is many times higher than the risk of kidney failure requiring kidney replacement therapy. As a result, high-dose statin therapy (e.g. atorvastatin 80 mg daily) is essential, and guidelines recommend antiplatelet therapy (e.g. aspirin) as part of vasculoprotective treatment.

Control of BP to optimal targets (systolic BP < 120 mm Hg when tolerated, using standardized office BP measurement) is the goal, but this may be achieved in only the minority of patients. Despite concerns regarding reduced glomerular filtration pressures associated with renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) blockers (i.e. angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers) in patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis or with renal artery stenosis in a solitary functioning kidney, RAAS blockers are the most logical antihypertensive agents, given the role of RAAS upregulation in the ischemic kidney. RAAS blockers should be introduced in all patients with ARVD. Although a fall in eGFR may occur, we consider the recommendation to withdraw RAAS therapy if this occurs to be too cautious. However, major reductions in eGFR (e.g. > 4 ml/ min per year)in patients with high-grade (> 75%) renal artery stenosis should prompt consideration of renal revascularization.

### Low-dose aspirin confers protection against acute cellular allograft rejection after primary liver transplantation [^114DpSRi]. Liver Transplantation (2022). Medium credibility.

The observation that the nonaspirin group was sicker might imply that adverse outcomes were more likely to occur compared with the aspirin group. This finding might assume that the beneficial effects of aspirin were rather related to the higher acuity of the recipient than the anti‐inflammatory and antithrombotic properties of aspirin. To address this potential confounding effect, we included parameters of medical acuity such as pretransplant life support (dialysis and/or ventilation) and MELD scores < 30 in our multivariate analysis.

Our multivariate analysis also identified two other important risk factors for ACR that we would like to highlight. First, perioperative red blood cell (RBC) transfusions improved rejection‐free survival after primary LT. This effect, also known as transfusion‐related immunomodulation (TRIM), has been initially reported in the renal transplant setting, when significantly improved renal allograft survival was observed in transplant recipients who received RBC transfusions. Although the immunosuppressive mechanisms of TRIM are not yet fully elucidated, impaired natural killer cell function and macrophage phagocytosis, defective antigen presentation, and suppression of lymphocytic proliferation are described as immunosuppressive alterations. These immunosuppressive effects of RBC TRIM might play an important role in why the factor RBC transfusion was an almost independent protective factor against ACR in our multivariate analysis. Second, our multivariate analysis identified allografts from DCD as an independent risk factor for ACR. However, this finding appears divergent from many studies reporting similar rejection rates for DBD and DCD organs.

### Post-transplantation diabetes mellitus [^112i8KUL]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

SGLT2 Inhibitors

There is presently no robust research evidence to support the use of SGLT2 inhibitors in PTDM. In patients with heart transplants, empagliflozin was shown to produce clinical reduction in body weight and blood pressure and a non-significant reduction in HBA1c. After 147 cumulative months of empagliflozin use, no adverse events such as diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) or genitourinary infections were reported. They are promising agents because of specific benefits, i.e. weight loss, low risk of hypoglycaemia, renoprotection, cardioprotection, and reduction in incidence and admissions with heart failure. They cannot be initiated in patients with an eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m² and should be discontinued when eGFR < 45 ml/min/1.73 m². Notably, in the EMPA-REG study, patients with an eGFR of 30 ml/min/1.73 m² were part of the study. No clinically meaningful interaction was noted between cyclosporine and canagliflozin in healthy participants.

In small experimental studies, empagliflozin has been shown to alleviate tacrolimus-induced renal and pancreatic cell injury, thereby stabilising and improving the resulting renal dysfunction and hyperglycaemia.

Bariatric Surgery

Randomized controlled trials in patients with type 2 DM undergoing bariatric surgery have shown sustained diabetes remission in 30–63% of the patients. Although there are no studies formally assessing metabolic surgery in PTDM, this can be offered as a mean for diabetes amelioration/remission in obese patients (BMI ≥ 35) affected by obesity-related complications and impaired QoL.

Prevention of CV Disease

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is quite prevalent in patients after kidney transplantation. Aspirin reduces atherosclerotic cardiovascular events in patients with known CVD. Low-dose aspirin is therefore recommended for secondary prevention.

### FIGO guideline on liver disease and pregnancy [^112EfwgM]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

4 PREGNANCY AFTER LIVER TRANSPLANT

Delaying pregnancy at least until 1 year is advised as it is associated with improved maternal and fetal outcomes including more stable graft function, reduced susceptibility to acute cellular rejection, reduced burden of immunosuppression and risk of infection, reduced rates of prematurity, and low birth weight.,

Pregnancy‐compatible drugs include azathioprine, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, and prednisolone. Mycophenolate mofetil is teratogenic and should be stopped at least 12 weeks before conception. De novo renal impairment occurs in up to one‐quarter of pregnant liver transplant patients and this should be monitored to enable decisions around management and the possibility of expedited delivery.

Women are at increased risk of gestational hypertension, pre‐eclampsia, cholestasis, gestational diabetes, and acute kidney injury and clinicians should ensure screening for these conditions and initiation of low‐dose aspirin in the first trimester for pre‐eclampsia prophylaxis. Live‐birth rates in women with liver transplant have increased over time with rates up to 84% now reported. Miscarriage rates reflect that of the background population and stillbirth rates of around 1% are reported. Rates of preterm birth and fetal growth restriction are increased compared with the background pregnant non‐transplant population. Mode of delivery should be related to obstetric indication, routine cesarean birth is not indicated.

Pregnancy after liver transplant

Best practice guidance
Women with liver transplant should be counseled to delay pregnancy for 1 year post transplant.
Pre‐pregnancy counseling should include discussion around the safety of medications, need for monitoring of blood markers of rejection, and increased rates of maternal gestational disorders including the appropriate screening.
Give low‐dose aspirin for pre‐eclampsia prophylaxis unless contradicated.

### Thrombophilic factors do not predict outcomes in renal transplant recipients under prophylactic acetylsalicylic acid [^1117HvvY]. American Journal of Transplantation (2010). Low credibility.

A cohort of recipients of renal transplant after 2000 (N = 310) was prospectively screened on the day of transplantation and 1 month later for a panel of 11 thrombophilic factors to assess their effect on posttransplant outcomes. All patients received prophylactic acetylsalicylic acid, started before transplantation. The rate of thromboembolic events or acute rejection episodes during the first posttransplant year (primary composite endpoint) was 16.7% among patients free of thrombophilic factor (N = 60) and 17.2% in those with ≥ 1 thrombophilic factor (N = 250) (p > 0.99). The incidence of the primary endpoint was similar among patients free of thrombophilic factors and those with ≥ 2 (N = 135), or ≥ 3 (N = 53) factors (16.3% and 15.1% respectively; p = 1) and in patients who remained thrombophilic at 1 month (15.7%; p = 0.84). None of the individual thrombophilic factor present at the day of transplantation was associated with the primary endpoint. The incidence of cardiovascular events at 1-year, serum creatinine at 1-year, 4-year actuarial graft and patient survival were not influenced by the presence of ≥ 1 thrombophilic factor at baseline (p = NS). In conclusion, the presence of thrombophilic factors does not influence thromboembolic events, acute rejection, graft or patient survival in patients transplanted after 2000 and receiving prophylactic acetylsalicylic acid.

### Use of cardioprotective medications in kidney transplant recipients [^116jWdAQ]. American Journal of Transplantation (2009). Low credibility.

Death with function causes half of late kidney transplant failures, and cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the most common cause of death in these patients. We examined the use of potentially cardioprotective medications in a prospective observational study at seven transplant centers in the United States and Canada. Among 935 patients, 87% received antihypertensive medications at both 1 and 6 months after transplantation. Similar antihypertensive regimens were used for patients with and without diabetes and CVD, but with wide variability among centers. In contrast, while 44% of patients were on angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) at the time of transplantation, the proportion taking these agents dropped to 12% at month 1, then increased to 24% at 6 months. Fewer than 30% with CVD or diabetes received ACEI/ARB therapy 6 months posttransplant. Aspirin use was uncommon (< 40% of patients). Even among those with diabetes and/or CVD, fewer than 60% received aspirin and only half received a statin at 1 and 6 months. This study demonstrates marked variability in the use of cardioprotective medications in kidney transplant recipients, a finding that may reflect, among several possible explanations, clinical uncertainty due the lack of randomized trials for these medications in this population.

### Effects of aspirin therapy on ultrasound-guided renal allograft biopsy bleeding complications [^115LtK2m]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

To determine if patient aspirin exposure and timing affect bleeding risk after renal allograft biopsy.

Materials and Methods

Review of 6,700 renal allograft biopsies (in 2,362 unique patients) was performed. Median patient age was 53.0 years [interquartile range 43.0, 62.0]; 56.2% of patients were male. Of biopsies, 4,706 (70.2%) were performed in patients with no aspirin exposure within 10 days of biopsy; 664 (9.9%), were performed within 8–10 days of aspirin exposure; 855 (12.8%), within 4–7 days; and 475 (7.1%), within 0–3 days. Follow-up to 3 months after the procedure was completed in all patients. Biopsies were categorized as protocol or indication; 19.7% were indication biopsies. Bleeding complications were graded based on SIR criteria. Logistic regression models examined the association between aspirin use and bleeding events.

Results

Rate [95% confidence interval] of major bleeding complications was 0.24% [0.14, 0.39], and rate of any bleeding complication was 0.66% [0.46, 0.90]. Bleeding events were significantly associated with patients undergoing indication biopsies compared with protocol biopsies (odds ratio [OR] 2.27, P = 0.012). Patient factors associated with major bleeding complications in multivariate models included estimated glomerular filtration rate (OR 0.61, P = 0.016) and platelet count (OR 0.64, P = 0.033). Aspirin use was not significantly associated with increased risk of bleeding complication except for use of 325 mg of aspirin within 3 days of biopsy (any complication OR 3.87 [1.12, 13.4], P = 0.032; major complication OR 6.30 [1.27, 31.3], P = 0.024).

Conclusions

Renal allograft biopsy bleeding complications are very rare, particularly for protocol biopsies. Use of 325 mg of aspirin within 3 days of renal allograft biopsy was associated with increased bleeding complications.

### Cardiovascular risk factors in kidney transplantation [^116KgQ59]. Current Opinion in Urology (2001). Low credibility.

Classical and non-classical cardiovascular risk factors are common after renal transplantation, and they are effectively associated with the development of cardiovascular disease. Despite the absence of large, controlled clinical trials examining the effect of prevention strategies, therapies should not be withheld from renal transplant recipients with significant risk factors, because their risk of developing cardiovascular disease is at least as high as that of the general population.

Guideline 6.4 – KTR: ischaemic heart disease

We suggest that KTRs receive standard treatment for ischaemic heart disease including thrombolysis, revascularisation, and secondary prevention (2C)

Audit Measures

Proportion of patients with ischaemic heart disease
Proportion of patients suffering myocardial infarction
Proportion of patients undergoing primary revascularisation
Proportion of patients receiving secondary prevention with a statin, anti-platelet agents and RAS blockers

Rationale

Coronary artery disease (CAD) is common in patients with ESRD, including transplant recipients, and is a major contributory factor to cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. The presence of coronary artery disease often influences the decision to transplant list patients with ESRD. Irrespective of the presence or severity of pre-transplant CAD, once transplanted, CAD is reported in 14–20% (previous myocardial infarction MI or CAD). Post transplantation myocardial infarction (MI) is common, affecting approximately 11.1% of patients by 3 years post transplantation, and much of this risk is experienced early, within the first 6 months of transplantation. MI risk has been shown to be linked with modifiable factors including delayed graft function, post transplantation diabetes and graft failure, and in turn, MI predicts graft failure and death. Additionally, the ALERT trial demonstrated that determinants of non-fatal myocardial infarction in RTR include total cholesterol level, prior CAD and previous acute rejection. Combined, these data suggest that whilst RTR share common risk factors with the general population for CAD and MI post transplantation, there are further graft-specific aspects to post-transplant CAD. It is known that patients with ESRD, including transplant recipients, are less likely to undergo cardiac intervention (bypass grafting, thrombolytics or per-catheter therapies), possibly because of higher complication rates, and are less likely to receive secondary prevention. There is no reason to believe that transplant recipients will benefit less than patients in the general population, many of whom have renal impairment. Patients with renal transplants should have equal access to cardiac investigations and surgery as patients without CKD.

### Aspirin and cardiovascular primary prevention in non-endstage chronic kidney disease: a meta-analysis [^1134ftjC]. Atherosclerosis (2016). Low credibility.

Background and Aims

Chronic kidney disease is a strong independent predictor of cardiovascular disease. No published meta-analyses on the use of aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in chronic kidney disease exist. We therefore performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of this subject.

Methods

We used a pre-defined and registered protocol (PROSPERO identification CRD42014008860). We searched Medline and Embase between 1996 and July 2015. Inclusion criteria were adult subjects with non-endstage chronic kidney disease (CKD) and no history of cardiovascular disease. The co-primary outcomes were major cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes included bleeding-related events. We used a random effects model to pool data.

Results

Three trials were identified and two of these provided previously unpublished data. The studies included 4468 participants and 16,740 person-years of follow-up. There were no statistically significant reductions in the risk of major cardiovascular events (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.73, p = 0.79, I(2) 71%) or mortality (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.00, p = 0.05, I(2) 0%) with aspirin compared to the control group. Major bleeding events were increased with aspirin though (RR 1.98, 95% CI 1.11 to 3.52, p = 0.02, I(2) 0%).

Conclusions

There is no clear benefit of aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events in CKD and no statistically significant reduction in mortality. Aspirin is likely to increase the risk of major bleeding events. Currently, insufficient randomised control trial data exists to recommend universal use or avoidance of aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular events in CKD.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for kidney transplantation, more specifically with respect to evaluation for eligibility, antithrombotic therapy, KDIGO 2020 guidelines recommend to consider continuing single-agent antiplatelet therapy (such as aspirin, clopidogrel, or ticagrelor) while waiting for a deceased donor transplant.

### Aspirin use and incident cardiovascular disease, kidney failure, and death in stable kidney transplant recipients: a post hoc analysis of the folic acid for vascular outcome reduction in transplantation (FAVORIT) trial [^1165rHJM]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in kidney transplant recipients. Whether aspirin may reduce the risk for CVD, death, and kidney failure outcomes is uncertain.

Study Design

Post hoc cohort analysis of FAVORIT, a randomized trial examining the effect of homocysteine-lowering vitamins on CVD in kidney transplant recipients.

Setting & Participants

Prevalent adult kidney transplant recipients with hyperhomocysteinemia and stable kidney function from the United States, Canada, and Brazil participating in FAVORIT, with no known history of CVD.

Predictor

Aspirin use, with aspirin users matched to nonusers using a propensity score.

Outcomes

Incident CVD events, kidney failure, all-cause mortality, a composite of CVD events or mortality, and a composite of kidney failure or mortality. Cox proportional hazards models with a robust variance to account for the correlation in outcomes within matched pairs were sequentially adjusted for demographic, clinical, and laboratory characteristics to assess the association between aspirin use and events.

Results

981 aspirin users were matched to 981 nonusers. During a 4-year mean follow up, there were 225 CVD events, 200 deaths, 126 kidney failure events, 301 composite kidney failure or mortality events, and 324 composite CVD or mortality events. Adjusted models showed no significant difference associated with aspirin use in risk for CVD events, all-cause mortality, kidney failure, composite of kidney failure or mortality, or composite of primary CVD events or mortality (HRs of 1.20 [95% CI, 0.92–1.58], 0.92 [95% CI, 0.69–1.23], 1.19 [95% CI, 0.81–1.74], 1.03 [0.82–1.31], and 1.11 [95% CI, 0.88–1.38], respectively).

Limitations

We did not examine dose or continued use of aspirin after randomization. CVD history is dependent on participant report at baseline. Aspirin use was non-randomly assigned.

Conclusions

Aspirin use is not associated with reduced risk for incident CVD, all-cause mortality, or kidney failure in stable kidney transplant recipients with no history of CVD.

### Interventions for preventing thrombosis in solid organ transplant recipients [^114dik4P]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Graft thrombosis is a well-recognised complication of solid organ transplantation and is one of the leading causes of graft failure. Currently there are no standardised protocols for thromboprophylaxis. Many transplant units use unfractionated heparin (UFH) and fractionated heparins (low molecular weight heparin; LMWH) as prophylaxis for thrombosis. Antiplatelet agents such as aspirin are routinely used as prophylaxis of other thrombotic conditions and may have a role in preventing graft thrombosis. However, any pharmacological thromboprophylaxis comes with the theoretical risk of increasing the risk of major blood loss following transplant. This review looks at benefits and harms of thromboprophylaxis in patients undergoing solid organ transplantation.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of instituting thromboprophylaxis to patients undergoing solid organ transplantation.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 10 November 2020 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs designed to examine interventions to prevent thrombosis in solid organ transplant recipients. All donor types were included (donor after circulatory (DCD) and brainstem death (DBD) and live transplantation). There was no upper age limit for recipients in our search.

Data Collection and Analysis

The results of the literature search were screened and data collected by two independent authors. Dichotomous outcome results were expressed as risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Random effects models were used for data analysis. Risk of bias was independently assessed by two authors using the risk of bias assessment tool. Confidence in the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.

Main Results

We identified nine studies (712 participants). Seven studies (544 participants) included kidney transplant recipients, and studies included liver transplant recipients. We did not identify any study enrolling heart, lung, pancreas, bowel, or any other solid organ transplant recipient. Selection bias was high or unclear in eight of the nine studies; five studies were at high risk of bias for performance and/or detection bias; while attrition and reporting biases were in general low or unclear. Three studies (180 participants) primarily investigated heparinisation in kidney transplantation. Only two studies reported on graft vessel thrombosis in kidney transplantation (144 participants). These small studies were at high risk of bias in several domains and reported only two graft thromboses between them; it therefore remains unclear whether heparin decreases the risk of early graft thrombosis or non-graft thrombosis (very low certainty). UFH may make little or no difference versus placebo to the rate of major bleeding events in kidney transplantation (3 studies, 155 participants: RR 2.92, 95% CI 0.89 to 9.56; I² = 0%; low certainty evidence). Sensitivity analysis using a fixed-effect model suggested that UFH may increase the risk of haemorrhagic events compared to placebo (RR 3.33, 95% CI 1.04 to 10.67, P = 0.04). Compared to control, any heparin (including LMWH) may make little or no difference to the number of major bleeding events (3 studies, 180 participants: RR 2.70, 95% CI 0.89 to 8.19; I² = 0%; low certainty evidence) and had an unclear effect on risk of readmission to intensive care (3 studies, 180 participants: RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.12 to 3.90, I² = 45%; very low certainty evidence). The effect of heparin on our other outcomes (including death, patient and graft survival, transfusion requirements) remains unclear (very low certainty evidence). Three studies (144 participants) investigated antiplatelet interventions in kidney transplantation: aspirin versus dipyridamole (1), and Lipo-PGE 1 plus low-dose heparin to "control" in patients who had a diagnosis of acute rejection (2). None of these reported on early graft thromboses. The effect of aspirin, dipyridamole and Lipo PGE 1 plus low-dose heparin on any outcomes is unclear (very low certainty evidence). Two studies (168 participants) assessed interventions in liver transplants. One compared warfarin versus aspirin in patients with pre-existing portal vein thrombosis and the other investigated plasmapheresis plus anticoagulation. Both studies were abstract-only publications, had high risk of bias in several domains, and no outcomes could be meta-analysed. Overall, the effect of any of these interventions on any of our outcomes remains unclear with no evidence to guide anti-thrombotic therapy in standard liver transplant recipients (very low certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Overall, there is a paucity of research in the field of graft thrombosis prevention. Due to a lack of high quality evidence, it remains unclear whether any therapy is able to reduce the rate of early graft thrombosis in any type of solid organ transplant. UFH may increase the risk of major bleeding in kidney transplant recipients, however this is based on low certainty evidence. There is no evidence from RCTs to guide anti-thrombotic strategies in liver, heart, lung, or other solid organ transplants. Further studies are required in comparing anticoagulants, antiplatelets to placebo in solid organ transplantation. These should focus on outcomes such as early graft thrombosis, major haemorrhagic complications, return to theatre, and patient/graft survival.

### First United Kingdom heart and renal protection (UK-HARP-I) study: biochemical efficacy and safety of simvastatin and safety of low-dose aspirin in chronic kidney disease [^114zcyXX]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with chronic kidney disease are at increased risk for cardiovascular disease, but the efficacy and safety of simvastatin and aspirin are unknown in this patient group.

Methods

Patients were randomly assigned in a 2 x 2 factorial design to the administration of: (1) 20 mg of simvastatin daily versus matching placebo, and (2) 100 mg of modified-release aspirin daily versus matching placebo.

Results

Overall, 448 patients with chronic kidney disease were randomly assigned (242 predialysis patients with a creatinine level ≥ 1.7 mg/dL [≥ 150 micromol/L], 73 patients on dialysis therapy, and 133 patients with a functioning transplant). Compliance with study treatments was 80% at 12 months. Allocation to treatment with 100 mg of aspirin daily was not associated with an excess of major bleeds (aspirin, 4 of 225 patients [2%] versus placebo, 6 of 223 patients [3%]; P = not significant [NS]), although there was a 3-fold excess of minor bleeds (34 of 225 [15%] versus 12 of 223 patients [5%]; P = 0.001). Among those with predialysis renal failure or a functioning transplant at baseline, aspirin did not increase the number of patients who progressed to dialysis therapy (7 of 187 [4%] versus 6 of 188 patients [3%]; P = NS) or experienced a greater than 20% increase in creatinine level (63 of 187 patients [34%] versus 56 of 188 patients [30%]; P = NS). After 12 months of follow-up, allocation to 20 mg of simvastatin daily reduced nonfasting total cholesterol levels by 18% (simvastatin, 163 mg/dL [4.22 mmol/L] versus placebo, 196 mg/dL [5.08 mmol/L]; P < 0.0001), directly measured low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels by 24% (89 mg/dL [2.31 mmol/L] versus 114 mg/dL [2.96 mmol/L]; P < 0.0001), and triglyceride levels by 13% (166 mg/dL [1.87 mmol/L] versus 186 mg/dL [2.10 mmol/L]; P < 0.01), but there was no significant effect on high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (2% increase; P = NS). Allocation to simvastatin therapy was not associated with excess risk for abnormal liver function test results or elevated creatine kinase levels.

Conclusion

During a 1-year treatment period, simvastatin, 20 mg/d, produced a sustained reduction of approximately one quarter in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, with no evidence of toxicity, and aspirin, 100 mg/d, did not substantially increase the risk for a major bleeding episode. Much larger trials are now needed to assess whether these treatments can prevent vascular events.

### Diagnosis and management of cardiovascular disease in advanced and end-stage renal disease [^115ee2t1]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Duration of DAPT

The 2014 ACC/AHA guidelines recommend that in patients undergoing urgent noncardiac surgery performed < 4 to 6 months after BMS or DES implantation, DAPT should be continued unless the relative risk of bleeding outweighs the benefit of prevention of stent thrombosis. 19 Moreover, DAPT should be continued for at least 6 months in patients with DESs if the risk of surgical delay is greater than the risk of DES thrombosis. Importantly, the ACC/AHA guidelines also recommend that perioperative management of DAPT should be discussed by a multidisciplinary team including the operating surgeon, cardiologist, anesthesiologist, and patient to weigh the risks of bleeding and stent thrombosis in an individualized fashion. Important factors to consider in perioperative DAPT management are the type, number, and size of stents versus the risk of delaying renal transplantation in favor of prolonging DAPT to prevent stent thrombosis. A newer generation of DESs with enhanced biocompatibility and reduced thrombogenicity may require only 1 to 6 months of DAPT depending on the type of stent, but more evidence is needed. 61, 66, 67 These considerations highlight the fact that DAPT should be tailored to the individual patient. For example, patients requiring multivessel PCI with the use of a DES for lesions involving coronary ostia, long lesions, bifurcation lesions, chronic total occlusions, or for cases in which the minimal stent area achieved is small, may benefit from a prolonged course of DAPT. In contrast, patients with high bleeding risk or single‐vessel disease who undergo PCI with a DES for simpler coronary lesions (AHA type A/B1) with a large minimal stent area achieved by imaging guidance may require shorter duration of DAPT. 68, 69 Moreover, it is important to note that patients with CKD have less platelet inhibition by clopidogrel. 70 Prasugrel and ticagrelor have not been well studied in CKD, and ticagrelor has a relative contraindication in patients with CKD. Data from a few recent clinical series show similar outcomes of renal transplantation performed on DAPT soon after DES implantation. Patients on DAPT or aspirin alone compared with patients not receiving antiplatelet therapy did not have a statistically significant increase in bleeding risk, requirement for blood transfusion, or reoperation. 71, 72 These studies should be interpreted with caution because the long‐term effects of increased periprocedural bleeding and the need for transfusion on graft survival are lacking.

### Antiplatelet agents for chronic kidney disease [^116EG7JK]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Antiplatelet agents are widely used to prevent cardiovascular events. The risks and benefits of antiplatelet treatment may be different in people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) for whom occlusive atherosclerotic events are less prevalent, and bleeding hazards might be increased.

Objectives

To summarise the effects of antiplatelet treatment (antiplatelet agent versus control or other antiplatelet agent) for the prevention of cardiovascular and adverse kidney outcomes in individuals with CKD.

Search Methods

In January 2011 we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Renal Group's Specialised Register without language restriction.

Selection Criteria

We selected randomised controlled trials of any antiplatelet treatment versus placebo or no treatment, or direct head-to-head antiplatelet agent studies in people with CKD. Studies were included if they enrolled participants with CKD, or included people in broader at-risk populations in which data for subgroups with CKD could be disaggregated.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently extracted data from primary study reports and any available supplementary information for study population, interventions, outcomes, and risks of bias. Risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated from numbers of events and numbers of participants at risk which were extracted from each included study. The reported RRs were extracted where crude event rates were not provided. Data was pooled using the random-effects model.

Main Results

We included 50 studies, enrolling 27,139 participants; 44 studies (21,460 participants) compared an antiplatelet agent with placebo or no treatment, and six studies (5679 participants) directly compared one antiplatelet agent with another. Compared to placebo or no treatment, antiplatelet agents reduced the risk of myocardial infarction (17 studies; RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.99), but not all-cause mortality (30 studies; RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.06), cardiovascular mortality (19 studies; RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.12) or stroke (11 studies; RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.72). Antiplatelet agents increased the risk of major (27 studies; RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.65) and minor bleeding (18 studies; RR 1.49, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.97). In terms of dialysis access outcomes, antiplatelet agents reduced access thrombosis or patency failure but had no effect on suitability for dialysis. Meta-regression analysis indicated no differences in the relative benefit or harms of treatment (risk of all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, or major bleeding) by type of antiplatelet agent or stage of CKD. Limited data were available for direct head-to-head comparisons of antiplatelet drugs, treatment in kidney transplant recipients, primary prevention, or risk of ESKD.

Authors' Conclusions

Antiplatelet agents reduce myocardial infarction but increase major bleeding. Risks may outweigh harms among people with low annual risks of cardiovascular events, including those with early stages of CKD who do not have clinically-evident occlusive cardiovascular disease.

### Sticky platelet syndrome: an underrecognized cause of graft dysfunction and thromboembolic complications in renal transplant recipients [^11248rsA]. American Journal of Transplantation (2007). Low credibility.

Sticky platelet syndrome (SPS) leads to hyperaggregabilty of platelets in response to physiologic stimuli. In this report we describe three patients with clinical symptoms of SPS after renal transplantation. The first patient developed an infarction of her transplant kidney with additional, subsequent renal microinfarctions. The second patient suffered multiple strokes and deep vein thrombosis with episodes of pulmonary embolism and ischemic bowel disease due to colonic microinfarctions. The third patient experienced a long episode of unexplained respiratory and graft dysfunction immediately after transplantation until therapy for SPS was initiated, at which point symptoms resolved quickly. Kidney transplant recipients with SPS may be at increased risk of developing thrombosis, given that most immunosuppressive drugs are known to induce either endothelial cell damage or augment platelet aggregation. All patients awaiting renal transplantation should be screened for a history of thrombosis and, if appropriate, tested for SPS. Affected patients should receive dose-adjusted acetylsalicylic acid.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 743: low-dose aspirin use during pregnancy [^117GL9VL]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

Low-dose aspirin has been used during pregnancy, most commonly to prevent or delay the onset of preeclampsia. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists issued the Hypertension in Pregnancy Task Force Report recommending daily low-dose aspirin beginning in the late first trimester for women with a history of early-onset preeclampsia and preterm delivery at less than 34 0/7 weeks of gestation, or for women with more than one prior pregnancy complicated by preeclampsia. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force published a similar guideline, although the list of indications for low-dose aspirin use was more expansive. Daily low-dose aspirin use in pregnancy is considered safe and is associated with a low likelihood of serious maternal, or fetal complications, or both, related to use. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine support the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force guideline criteria for prevention of preeclampsia. Low-dose aspirin (81 mg/day) prophylaxis is recommended in women at high risk of preeclampsia and should be initiated between 12 weeks and 28 weeks of gestation (optimally before 16 weeks) and continued daily until delivery. Low-dose aspirin prophylaxis should be considered for women with more than one of several moderate risk factors for preeclampsia. Women at risk of preeclampsia are defined based on the presence of one or more high-risk factors (history of preeclampsia, multifetal gestation, renal disease, autoimmune disease, type 1 or type 2 diabetes, and chronic hypertension) or more than one of several moderate-risk factors (first pregnancy, maternal age of 35 years or older, a body mass index greater than 30, family history of preeclampsia, sociodemographic characteristics, and personal history factors). In the absence of high risk factors for preeclampsia, current evidence does not support the use of prophylactic low-dose aspirin for the prevention of early pregnancy loss, fetal growth restriction, stillbirth, or preterm birth.

### Efficacy and safety of chemical thromboprophylaxis in renal transplantation – A systematic review [^114MZTYw]. Thrombosis Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The benefit of administering chemical thromboprophylaxis to chronic kidney disease patients undergoing renal transplantation is unclear and no previous systematic review has addressed this as reflected by variations in national guidelines.

Methods

A literature search was performed using MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane, CINAHL, World Health Organisation (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov databases to December 2019. Studies included participants undergoing renal transplantation only with no contra-indication to thromboprophylaxis, no history/clinical suspicion of acute organ rejection and those describing a form of chemical thromboprophylaxis intervention compared with another form, no intervention or placebo.

Results

Thirteen studies with 1600 patients were included. There was wide variation concerning type of thromboprophylaxis, time of onset, dosing and duration. Reports of symptomatic/asymptomatic venous thromboembolism and mortality were limited. Seven studies reported on renal allograft thrombosis. When comparing thromboprophylaxis to no intervention, there was no evidence of difference for thrombosis risk (risk ratio 0.2; [95% CI 0.01–4.63]), however all studies were underpowered to answer this question. Six studies reported on major bleeding but type of intervention, timing of onset and duration of thromboprophylaxis varied significantly, making it difficult to pool data for further analysis.

Conclusion

There is insufficient evidence to advise on efficacy and safety of chemical thromboprophylaxis in patients undergoing renal transplantation or to determine whether one chemical thromboprophylaxis is better than another thromboprophylaxis.

Obstetric management in transplant recipients — key timeline interventions: Pertinent issues include high dose folic acid (4–5 mg/day); an early fetal anatomic survey (11–16 weeks); at 24–28 weeks, an oral glucose tolerance test to screen for gestational diabetes (earlier screening if high risk); and low-dose aspirin (75–162 mg daily) started at 12–16 weeks and continued until delivery; consider calcium supplementation. Delivery planning notes that cesarean delivery is reserved for obstetric indications or intractable heart failure, and the fourth trimester requires close monitoring for hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and return to pre-pregnancy state.

### Impaired P2Y12 inhibition by clopidogrel in kidney transplant recipients: results from a cohort study [^1129pxHZ]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusion

As a conclusion, KT is associated with an increased prevalence of high on-clopidogrel platelet reactivity. Our results suggest that platelet function tests may be clinically useful for the management of this specific population. However, the clinical impact and the precise mechanisms of this interaction remain to be established. Future studies should assess whether a tailored antiplatelet therapy based on PRI VASP monitoring may significantly improve clinical outcomes in CKD patients undergoing KT.

### Pros and cons of antithrombotic therapy in end-stage kidney disease: a 2019 update [^1111FAvT]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2019). Medium credibility.

Dialysis patients manifest both an increased thrombotic risk and a haemorrhagic tendency. A great number of patients with chronic kidney disease requiring dialysis have cardiovascular comorbidities (coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation or venous thromboembolism) and different indications for treatment with antithrombotics (primary or secondary prevention). Unfortunately, few randomized controlled trials deal with antiplatelet and/or anticoagulant therapy in dialysis. Therefore cardiology and nephrology guidelines offer ambiguous recommendations and often exclude or ignore these patients. In our opinion, there is a need for an expert consensus that provides physicians with useful information to make correct decisions in different situations requiring antithrombotics. Herein the European Dialysis Working Group presents up-to-date evidence about the topic and encourages practitioners to choose among alternatives in order to limit bleeding and minimize atherothrombotic and cardioembolic risks. In the absence of clear evidence, these clinical settings and consequent therapeutic strategies will be discussed by highlighting data from observational studies for and against the use of antiplatelet and anticoagulant drugs alone or in combination. Until new studies shed light on unclear clinical situations, one should keep in mind that the objective of treatment is to minimize thrombotic risk while reducing bleeding events.

### Clinical practice guideline on pregnancy and renal disease [^115avJVZ]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Pre-eclampsia prophylaxis

Guideline 4.3.1

We recommend women with CKD are offered low-dose aspirin (75–150 mg) in pregnancy to reduce the risk of pre-eclampsia (1B).

Guideline 4.3.2

We suggest kidney donors are offered low dose aspirin (75 mg–150 mg) to reduce the risk of pre-eclampsia (2D).

Rationale

Women with CKD have an increased risk of pre-eclampsia compared to women without CKD and should be offered pre-eclampsia prophylaxis with aspirin. This recommendation is generalised from high-quality evidence that low dose aspirin is associated with a reduced incidence of pre-eclampsia in other high-risk cohorts, although there is limited definitive evidence as to the optimal gestation and dose for women with CKD. A recent subgroup analysis of women with chronic hypertension from a randomised-controlled trial of 150 mg aspirin (150 mg) failed to show a reduction in the risk of subsequent pre-eclampsia, although these data are difficult to interpret in the absence of standardised diagnostic criteria for superimposed pre-eclampsia. Current national guidance recommends prescribing 75–150 mg of aspirin from 12 weeks' gestation onwards, but future research may elucidate optimisation of prophylaxis in women with CKD.

Women who have donated a kidney are at increased risk of pre-eclampsia (odds ratio 2.4; 95% confidence intervals 1.0–5.6). Pre-eclampsia prophylaxis with aspirin should be discussed with these women, particularly in the presence of other known risk factors as outlined in national guidelines.

The benefit of calcium supplementation in reducing the prevalence of pre-eclampsia remains unclear. A Cochrane systematic review of randomised controlled trials showed that supplementation of a least 1 g calcium per day was associated with a 55% reduction in pre-eclampsia, although the effect was mostly shown in smaller trials, with possible confounding by low dietary calcium intake. In contrast, large randomised controlled trials of calcium supplementation starting both before and after 20 weeks' gestation have failed to show a benefit in reducing the incidence of pre-eclampsia. In the absence of evidence specific to women with CKD, and given the potential cardiovascular sequelae of a positive calcium balance in women with CKD, it was the consensus opinion of the guideline committee that calcium supplementation to reduce the risk of pre-eclampsia cannot be recommended for women with CKD, based on current evidence.

### Atrial fibrillation in kidney transplant recipients: is there a place for the novel drugs? [^114asJKs]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2018). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia of high clinical importance, occurring in 2% of the general population and in 19–24% in patients with chronic kidney disease. It is a well-known risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Kidney transplant recipients with a history of AF were associated with significantly higher rate of ischaemic strokes, graft failure and post-transplant mortality. AF occurs in over 7% of kidney transplant recipients in the first 3years after transplantation and is associated with reduced graft and patient survival. The incidence of stroke in patients after kidney transplantation (KTx) is higher than the general population, but markedly lower than those on dialysis. Oral anticoagulation (OAC) therapy is recommended in AF patients at high risk of stroke. There are no randomized studies assessing OAC in patients after KTx and there are no specific recommendations and guidelines on therapeutic strategies in these patients. KTx recipients are a vulnerable population, exposed to variations in renal function, being at higher risk of bleeding and thrombotic complications, with possible interactions with immunosuppression. Surely, there is a place for novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) in this group of patients as long as the summary of product characteristics is followed, as they are a valuable anticoagulation therapy. On one hand, they are at least as effective as warfarin; on the other hand NOACs are safer, especially when it comes to intracranial haemorrhages. However, NOACs seem to be underused in this population as they are excreted via kidney, may interact with immunosuppressive therapy and physicians need more experience and confidence in their administration. Percutaneous left atrial appendage occlusion procedure may also be considered as an opportunity for this group of patients, in particular in the presence of contraindications to anticoagulation.

Kidney biopsy — bleeding prevention strategies include assessing bleeding history, holding antithrombotics, checking labs, kidney function, and blood pressure, and selective desmopressin use. Strategies listed are to "Assess personal and family history for bleeding diathesis", "Stop anticoagulants before the scheduled procedure" including "Stop aspirin at least 1 wk before procedure", "Stop nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents several days before (to ensure 4–5 half-lives have elapsed)", "Stop warfarin and consider switch to heparin in advance of procedure", and "Stop heparin before procedure". Pre-biopsy labs are specified: "Check complete blood count and coagulation parameters before biopsy" with "Bleeding time? — controversial". Kidney function checks are included: "Use equation to estimate GFR". For abnormal bleeding time and/or low GFR, "Consider administration of ddAVP", with dosing "0.3 μg/kg given in 50 mL of saline over 15–30 min immediately before procedure". Blood pressure control is addressed: "Control blood pressure on day of procedure" and "May give oral agents before procedure to decrease blood pressure".

### KDOQI US commentary on the KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of CKD [^1135CPTf]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in chronic kidney disease (CKD) — The commentary notes evidence gaps and the need to balance benefits and harms: "There is a paucity of literature on primary prevention strategies (including antiplatelet agents) for CVD in persons with CKD. Careful studies are needed to understand the best approaches for primary prevention, carefully balancing possible harm with benefits". It further states, "Patients with CKD may have greater risk of adverse events such as bleeding (as seen in the Cochrane meta-analysis for secondary prevention). Further, a patient-centered approach is needed to account for patient preferences, pill burden, and quality of life".

Aspirin use in adult heart transplant recipients — evidence status and ongoing trial are summarized as follows: There are no randomized studies analyzing the effect of antiplatelet therapy with aspirin in heart transplant recipients as primary prevention for cardiovascular events, though two observational studies suggest early aspirin in the first year post-transplant is associated with lower CAV development and fewer CAV-related events. The AERIAL trial will randomize post-transplant patients to placebo, aspirin, or clopidogrel; it is a feasibility study that will also assess effects of early antiplatelet initiation on coronary health.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of chronic kidney disease in patients infected with HIV: 2014 update by the HIV Medicine Association of the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^113kSDTJ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Cardiovascular risk reduction therapies in HIV-infected patients with CKD — We recommend using angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) in those with confirmed or suspected HIVAN or clinically significant albuminuria, with thresholds such as > 30 mg/day in diabetic patients and > 300 mg/day in nondiabetic patients. We recommend statins for HIV-infected individuals with pre-ESRD CKD to prevent cardiovascular disease as appropriate for persons in the highest cardiovascular risk group, for example > 7.5% 10-year risk of cardiovascular disease. We suggest that clinicians consider prescribing aspirin 75–100 mg/day to prevent cardiovascular disease in HIV-infected individuals with CKD, and the benefit of aspirin should be balanced against the individual's risk of bleeding.

### Combination immunosuppressive therapy to prevent kidney… [^113Rgyqn]. ClinicalTrials (2004). Low credibility.

Combination Immunosuppressive Therapy to Prevent Kidney Transplant Rejection in AdultsClinicalTrials. gov ID Study Overview Transplant rejection occurs when a patient's body does not recognize the new organ and attacks it. Patients who have kidney transplants must take drugs to prevent transplant rejection. Alemtuzumab is a man-made antibody used to treat certain blood disorders. The purpose of this study is to test the safety and effectiveness of using alemtuzumab in combination with two other drugs, sirolimus and tacrolimus, to prevent organ rejection after kidney transplantation. This study will also test whether this combination of medications will allow patients to eventually stop taking antirejection medications entirely. Study hypothesis: A new strategy of immunosuppression using alemtuzumab, tacrolimus, and sirolimus for human renal transplantation will permit a step-wise withdrawal from immunosuppressive drugs.

Drugs that suppress the immune system, such as sirolimus and tacrolimus, have contributed to increased success of transplantation. However, to prevent organ rejection, transplant recipients need to take immunosuppressive drugs for the rest of their lives, and these drugs make patients more susceptible to infection, endangering their health and survival. This study will last up to 4 years. Participants will undergo kidney transplantation on Day 0 and will receive intravenous doses of alemtuzumab, acetaminophen, and diphenhydramine on Days 0, 1, and 2, as well as methylprednisolone on Day 0. After transplant, patients will receive up to 10 days of valganciclovir or acyclovir. Participants will take tacrolimus daily by mouth for at least 60 days after transplant and sirolimus daily by mouth for at least 12 months after transplant.

As part of opportunistic infection prophylaxis, participants will also take sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim by mouth 3 times a week, valganciclovir or acyclovir for up to 10 days post-transplant, and clotrimazole or nystatin by mouth for at least 3 months post-transplant. Participants eligible for sirolimus withdrawal will undergo several kidney biopsies, including one 2 weeks prior to the start of withdrawal, 6 and 12 months after completion of withdrawal, 1 year after study enrollment, and annually thereafter.

### Mini-dose aspirin and renal function in the elderly… [^111w4tsd]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

The role of aspirin has changed from high-dose treatment for inflammation to low-dose or mini-dose for thromboembolic risk prevention. As a result, over-the-counter preparations account for most aspirin that is taken. While studies have demonstrated that high-dose aspirin therapy can adversely affect renal function and uric acid secretion, the impact of a mini-dose regimen on the kidneys has not been examined. Elderly patients are more likely to use mini-dose aspirin therapy but may also be more susceptible to the adverse effects of aspirin on the kidneys. Caspi and associates studied the effect of mini-dose aspirin on renal function and uric acid secretion in elderly patients. Elderly patients with a history of renal failure, hyperuricemia, gout or bleeding were excluded from the study, as were patients currently taking anticoagulants, aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

Patients were given aspirin in a dosage of 75 mg per day in the first week, 150 mg per day in the second week, 325 mg per day in the third week and zero mg during the fourth week. At the lowest dosage of aspirin, the excretion rate of uric acid dropped, and the serum levels rose. Creatinine and uric acid secretion rates were parallel during aspirin therapy. One week after aspirin was discontinued, the uric acid clearance rate returned to baseline, while the creatinine clearance rate remained lower. Plasma aspirin levels varied among the participants, but those whose levels were above the median had significantly more changes in renal parameters. The negative effect of mini-dose aspirin therapy was greater in patients with low serum albumin levels or concomitant diuretic therapy. editor's note: Aspirin has become a common preventive against thromboembolic events. Advertisements in the lay media have emphasized this property.

Because aspirin is an over-the-counter medication, physicians may be unaware that their patients are taking it on a regular basis. This study shows that, even at very low dosages, aspirin has a negative effect on renal function and uric acid secretion in elderly patients. When recommending aspirin therapy to elderly patients, physicians should weigh the risks and benefits of this therapy. This is particularly true in patients who have low albumin levels or are already taking diuretics. — k. e. m.
