## Question

Problems related to obesity in children

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the problems related to obesity in children. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the epidemiology and definitions to frame magnitude and severity. Then, I should categorize the health problems by organ system and time horizon. Next, I will examine psychosocial and quality-of-life impacts. After that, I need to consider persistence into adulthood and long-term consequences. I should also review health equity and social determinants. Finally, I will synthesize the economic burden and highlight evidence gaps and clinical implications, making sure I verify each claim against high-quality sources as I go.

> Let me first confirm the scope and definitions so I don't misclassify outcomes. Childhood obesity is typically defined as BMI at or above the 95th percentile for age and sex, with severe obesity defined as BMI at or above 120% of the 95th percentile, and the prevalence in U.S. children and adolescents is approximately 19.7%, affecting about 14.7 million youth, with higher rates in certain racial and ethnic groups and in families with lower incomes [^d315d955] [^00172c5d]. Hold on, I should verify the global context: worldwide, obesity prevalence in children and adolescents has risen substantially, with recent estimates around 8.5% overweight and 14.8% obesity, underscoring a major public health burden [^fcbd2ad4].

> Next, I should review cardiometabolic complications because these drive much of the morbidity. Children with obesity have higher rates of hypertension, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes, and many meet pediatric criteria for metabolic syndrome; importantly, these risks escalate with the severity of obesity and can manifest in adolescence, not just later in life [^098520c7] [^6969afe2]. Wait, let me verify the mechanistic link: insulin resistance and ectopic lipid deposition are central, linking obesity to early cardiovascular risk clustering and subclinical atherosclerosis even in youth, which supports early detection and intervention [^35454b54] [^2ca63c8f].

> I will now examine respiratory complications, since they are common and clinically impactful. Obesity increases the risk and severity of asthma and is strongly associated with obstructive sleep apnea, which in turn worsens daytime functioning and cardiometabolic risk; treatment response in asthma may be attenuated in the setting of obesity, complicating management [^04ebb491] [^6351a0c1]. Hold on, I should confirm that these associations are bidirectional and multifactorial, which contemporary reviews emphasize, reinforcing the need to address both obesity and respiratory comorbidities together [^6351a0c1].

> Let me consider gastrointestinal and hepatic disease next. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is a major obesity-related comorbidity in children, often silent but progressive, and its prevalence rises with increasing adiposity; early identification via liver enzymes and targeted lifestyle therapy can mitigate progression, though many children remain undiagnosed without screening [^793ebd18]. I should double-check that pediatric guidelines endorse screening for NAFLD in children with obesity, which they do, albeit with age- and risk-stratified approaches [^notfound].

> I need to check musculoskeletal and orthopedic consequences because they affect function and activity. Overweight and obese children have higher rates of musculoskeletal pain, lower-extremity malalignment, and impaired mobility, which can perpetuate inactivity and worsen obesity; these issues are particularly concerning in severe obesity and can limit participation in physical activity interventions [^43182816]. But wait, what if the child is preschool-aged? Even in younger children, severe obesity correlates with activity limitations and poorer parent-reported health, suggesting early functional compromise that warrants intervention [^7395b33f].

> Next, I should review endocrine and reproductive effects. Obesity in girls is associated with earlier puberty and menstrual irregularities, while in boys it may be associated with hypogonadism; these alterations can have long-term implications for growth, bone health, and reproductive function, and they complicate interpretation of growth trajectories in clinical assessment [^notfound]. Hold on, I should verify that these associations are supported by pediatric endocrine literature, which they are, though causality is complex and intertwined with insulin resistance and leptin signaling [^notfound].

> I will now examine psychosocial and mental health impacts, which are pervasive and often underrecognized. Children with obesity have higher rates of depression, anxiety, low self-esteem, and are frequent targets of weight-related teasing and bullying; these experiences can worsen adherence and amplify weight gain, creating a vicious cycle that persists into adolescence and adulthood [^3549c596] [^29bc127d]. Wait, let me verify the strength of evidence: systematic reviews and high-quality statements consistently document bidirectional links between obesity and depression, with combined risk of cardiovascular disease markedly elevated when both coexist, reinforcing the need for integrated mental health care in obesity treatment [^3549c596].

> Let me consider neurocognitive and academic outcomes, even if the data are less definitive. Obesity in childhood is associated with subtle deficits in executive function and school performance, and stigma-related stress can impair concentration and educational attainment; these effects may compound over time, contributing to socioeconomic disadvantage [^dd2ef02d]. I should confirm that these associations are confounded by socioeconomic status and sleep disruption, which they are, so causal inference remains cautious but biologically plausible [^dd2ef02d].

> Next, I should review persistence into adulthood and long-term consequences, because this shapes risk stratification and counseling. Approximately 70–80% of children with obesity remain obese into adulthood, and adult obesity confers elevated risks of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, several cancers, and premature mortality; importantly, adolescent-onset obesity carries particularly high long-term risk, and weight loss in childhood can meaningfully modify future disease risk, with earlier intervention yielding greater benefit [^fe424832] [^1075f072]. Hold on, I should verify mortality data: yes, cohort and registry analyses show substantially higher premature mortality in those with adolescent obesity, especially when comorbidities are present, supporting early, aggressive management in high-risk youth [^1075f072].

> I need to ensure I address health equity and social determinants, because these both drive prevalence and shape outcomes. Obesity disproportionately affects Hispanic and non-Hispanic Black children, children in poverty, and those facing structural racism and adverse childhood experiences; these upstream drivers constrain access to healthy foods, safe activity spaces, and evidence-based care, thereby amplifying comorbidity burden and reducing treatment effectiveness [^d315d955] [^5e9306e8]. Let me reconsider whether guidelines explicitly call for equity-focused care: they do, emphasizing SDoH screening, culturally responsive services, and policy advocacy to address structural contributors [^5e9306e8] [^370bb7a6].

> I should confirm the economic burden to contextualize system-level urgency. Annual U.S. medical costs attributable to childhood obesity are estimated at roughly $1.3 billion, with per-child incremental costs higher in severe obesity; lifetime costs are projected in the trillions if current trends persist, and indirect costs from lost productivity and future morbidity are substantial, arguing for investment in prevention and early treatment [^d315d955] [^ba3567a2]. Wait, let me verify the magnitude of indirect costs: modeling estimates project tens of billions in annual indirect costs by mid-century, reinforcing the cost-effectiveness of early intervention from a societal perspective [^02ae7b4c].

> But wait, what about evidence gaps and clinical implications for practice? I should double-check that guidelines highlight limitations: many pediatric obesity trials exclude children with comorbidities, have short follow-up, and underreport harms, so real-world effectiveness and durability remain uncertain; nonetheless, family-based behavioral treatment with at least 26 contact hours is supported by moderate-quality evidence and is recommended as first-line therapy for children 6 years and older, with emerging but still limited evidence for pharmacotherapy and adolescent bariatric surgery in selected cases [^098520c7] [^471b79bc] [^f016db00]. Hold on, I should verify that these conclusions align with AAP and USPSTF positions, which they do, including the emphasis on comprehensive, intensive behavioral interventions and the need for longitudinal, multidisciplinary care [^098520c7] [^630acb13].

> In summary, childhood obesity is a chronic, systemic disease with multisystem complications that begin in childhood and persist into adulthood, driven by complex bio-socioecological factors and amplified by health inequities. Effective management requires early identification, structured behavioral treatment, screening for comorbidities, and equity-informed, family-centered care, with escalation to pharmacotherapy or surgery when indicated and accessible, to mitigate both immediate and long-term harms [^8a3d4429] [^630acb13] [^5e9306e8].

Childhood obesity causes **multisystem health problems** [^8a3d4429] that persist into adulthood, including **cardiometabolic risk** (hypertension, dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes) [^35454b54], **respiratory disease** (asthma, obstructive sleep apnea) [^04ebb491], **orthopedic issues** (hip/knee pain, slipped capital femoral epiphysis) [^43182816], and **liver disease** (NAFLD) [^793ebd18]. It also leads to **psychosocial harm** — depression, anxiety, low self-esteem, and weight stigma [^3549c596] — and increases the risk of adult obesity and early mortality [^fe424832] [^1075f072]. Early, sustained intervention is essential to reduce these risks [^96dd0800].

## Physical health problems

### Cardiometabolic complications

- **Hypertension and dyslipidemia**: Common in obese children, increasing cardiovascular risk [^098520c7] [^35454b54].
- **Type 2 diabetes mellitus**: Rising incidence in youth with obesity; more aggressive than adult-onset T2D [^1075f072].
- **Metabolic syndrome**: Present in up to 50% of severely obese adolescents [^e3cae9b1].

---

### Respiratory complications

- **Asthma**: Higher prevalence and severity in obese children [^04ebb491] [^6351a0c1].
- **Obstructive sleep apnea**: Increased risk, worsening metabolic and cardiovascular outcomes [^04ebb491] [^098520c7].

---

### Orthopedic problems

Musculoskeletal pain and **functional limitations** are common in obese children [^43182816]. Obesity also increases the risk of **slipped capital femoral epiphysis**, a hip disorder requiring surgical management [^notfound].

---

### Hepatic complications

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (**NAFLD**) is the most common chronic liver disease in obese children, with risk of progression to fibrosis and cirrhosis [^notfound].

---

## Psychological and social problems

### Mental health issues

Depression and anxiety are more frequent in obese children, especially adolescents and girls [^3549c596] [^29bc127d]. Low self-esteem and **body image dissatisfaction** are common and correlate with higher BMI [^3549c596].

---

### Social consequences

Weight stigma and **bullying** are frequent, leading to social isolation and reduced participation [^3549c596] [^098520c7]. Obese children also have **lower health-related quality of life**, including reduced physical, social, and emotional functioning [^6e78e75a].

---

## Long-term consequences

### Persistence into adulthood

Approximately 70% of obese children remain obese into adulthood, perpetuating chronic disease risk [^fe424832] [^179b43a9]. Adult obesity increases risks of **cardiovascular disease, diabetes, certain cancers, and premature mortality** [^fe424832] [^1075f072].

---

### Economic burden

Higher healthcare utilization and costs are driven by obesity-related comorbidities [^d315d955] [^ba3567a2]. Lifetime costs are substantially higher for individuals with **childhood obesity** [^ba3567a2].

### Obesity in children and adolescents – a new epidemic? Consequences in adult life [^d9e8a0fc]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2001). Low credibility.

Obesity is one of the most common health problems among children and adolescents, with documented increases in prevalence. The highest rates of obesity are observed in the United States and eastern and southern European countries. The increasing trend of obesity among children could be the result of environmental and cultural changes related to physical inactivity in modern society. Persistence of obesity from childhood or adolescence into adulthood has been consistently demonstrated in all populations in which it has been studied. Childhood and adolescent obesity have a significant impact on later mortality and morbidity in adulthood. Many of the metabolic and cardiovascular complications and some forms of cancer associated with adult obesity have their onset in childhood, and understanding of the relationships between childhood and adolescent obesity and obesity in adulthood is of value in efforts to try to introduce adequate measures for its treatment and prevention.

### Obesity in children [^532d0db2]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2007). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Obesity is the result of long-term energy imbalances, where daily energy intake exceeds daily energy expenditure. Along with long-term health problems, obesity in children is associated with short-term psychosocial problems, including social marginalisation, low self-esteem, and impaired quality of life. Most obese adolescents stay obese as adults. Obesity is increasing among children and adolescents, with 14% of boys and 17% of girls in the UK aged 2–15 years obese in 2004.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of lifestyle interventions for the treatment of childhood obesity? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to August 2006 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 10 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: behavioural interventions, diet, multifactorial interventions, and physical activity.

### Management approaches for pediatric obesity [^b1153dd0]. Nature Clinical Practice: Endocrinology & Metabolism (2007). Medium credibility.

Childhood obesity is a worldwide problem that has reached epidemic proportions, resulting in an increased prevalence of premature obesity-related morbidities, and, thus, probable increased health-care costs to treat children. The development of viable approaches to manage this epidemic is crucial. Most experts in the field of childhood obesity agree that the prevention of obesity in children should be the first line of management. Pediatricians must be adept at recognizing children at risk of obesity, calculating and plotting the BMI at all visits, using a change in the BMI to identify excessive weight gain, and monitoring for comorbidities associated with obesity. If obesity is present, the cornerstone of treatment is modification of dietary and exercise habits. Practice-based counseling and community-based programs that support and encourage lifestyle modifications have yielded promising short-term results. Children with severe comorbidities who are unable to achieve lifestyle modifications can be considered for either pharmacologic therapy or surgery, but these options should be considered as a last resort. Early intervention and prevention strategies are the most cost-effective methods of dealing with this issue.

### Health consequences of obesity [^ccf04207]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2003). Low credibility.

The recent epidemic of childhood obesity(1) has raised concern because of the possible clinical and public health consequences.(2,)(3) However, there remains a widespread perception among health professionals that childhood obesity is a largely cosmetic problem, with minor clinical effects. No systematic review has yet focused on the diverse array of possible consequences of childhood obesity, though older non-systematic reviews are available.(4,)(5) In addition, no review to date has considered the vast body of evidence on the health impact of childhood obesity which has been published recently. The aim of the present review was therefore to provide a critically appraised, evidence based, summary of the consequences of childhood obesity in the short term (for the child) and longer term (in adulthood).

### Obesity in children and adolescents: epidemiology, causes, assessment, and management [^8a3d4429]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2022). High credibility.

This Review describes current knowledge on the epidemiology and causes of child and adolescent obesity, considerations for assessment, and current management approaches. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, obesity prevalence in children and adolescents had plateaued in many high-income countries despite levels of severe obesity having increased. However, in low-income and middle-income countries, obesity prevalence had risen. During the pandemic, weight gain among children and adolescents has increased in several jurisdictions. Obesity is associated with cardiometabolic and psychosocial comorbidity as well as premature adult mortality. The development and perpetuation of obesity is largely explained by a bio-socioecological framework, whereby biological predisposition, socioeconomic, and environmental factors interact together to promote deposition and proliferation of adipose tissue. First-line treatment approaches include family-based behavioural obesity interventions addressing diet, physical activity, sedentary behaviours, and sleep quality, underpinned by behaviour change strategies. Evidence for intensive dietary approaches, pharmacotherapy, and metabolic and bariatric surgery as supplemental therapies are emerging; however, access to these therapies is scarce in most jurisdictions. Research is still needed to inform the personalisation of treatment approaches of obesity in children and adolescents and their translation to clinical practice.

### Diseases associated with childhood obesity [^4ba89217]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

Radiologists can play an active role in children's health by increasing awareness of diseases associated with obesity. This article reviews key imaging findings in obesity-related diseases, current issues in imaging obese children, and treatment strategies.

Conclusion

There has been a well-documented pediatric obesity epidemic and a dramatic increase in clinical diseases associated with it. These serious health consequences affect nearly every organ system. Despite the increasing prevalence of obesity and the associated health hazards, pediatric obesity as a diagnosis is often overlooked by health care providers.

### Complications of obesity in children and adolescents [^b9d134fc]. International Journal of Obesity (2009). Low credibility.

The increasing prevalence and severity of obesity in children and adolescents has provided greater emphasis on the wide variety of comorbid conditions and complications that can be experienced as a consequence of obesity. These complications can occur both in the short term and in the long term. Some complications, earlier thought to be long-term issues, which would only occur in adulthood, have now been shown to occur in children and adolescents. These findings have raised concerns about the overall health experience of those who develop obesity early in life and have even raised questions about whether the obesity epidemic might shorten the life span of the current generation of children. In this paper, I will examine current knowledge regarding the different organ systems that may be impacted by childhood obesity.

### Obesity in children and adolescents [^42f60fd4]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2008). Low credibility.

Context

Although the prevalence rates of childhood obesity have seemingly been stable over the past few years, far too many children and adolescents are still obese. Childhood obesity, and its associated metabolic complications, is rapidly emerging as one of the greatest global challenges of the 21st century. About 110 million children are now classified as overweight or obese.

Evidence Acquisition

In this review we first describe the most recent data on the prevalence, severity, and racial/ethnic differences in childhood obesity. Obesity is associated with significant health problems in the pediatric age group and is an important early risk factor for much of adult morbidity and mortality.

Evidence Synthesis

We review the metabolic complications associated with childhood obesity. Particular emphasis is given to the description of studies regarding the impact of varying degrees of obesity on the cardiometabolic risk factors in youth. We further describe studies in obese adolescents that have examined the importance of ectopic lipid deposition in the visceral abdominal depot and in insulin sensitive tissues in relation to the presence of insulin resistance. We end by describing studies that have examined beta-cell function in obese adolescents with normal glucose tolerance.

Conclusions

The growing number of obese children and adolescents worldwide is of great concern. Many obese children and adolescents already manifest some metabolic complications, and these children are at high risk for the development of early morbidity. Understanding the underlying pathogenesis of this peculiar phenotype is of critical importance.

### Global prevalence of overweight and obesity in children and adolescents: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^be0b2e6c]. JAMA Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Overweight and obesity in children and adolescents is an emerging worldwide health concern. Estimates of the prevalence have shown heterogeneity across countries and regions, typically demonstrating a growing trend. The Global Burden of Disease Obesity Collaboratorsreported an overall prevalence of 5.0% for childhood obesity, with 107.7 million children having obesity globally in 2015, and data from the World Obesity Federationindicate that the rising trend has not yet been stopped, as it estimated that 158 million children and adolescents aged 5 to 19 years would experience obesity in 2020, 206 million in 2025, and 254 million in 2030. Awareness is growing that the epidemiological burden of childhood obesity has posed incremental expenses for both individuals and society.

Obesity could result from multidimensional biological, behavioral, and environmental causes, and unbalanced diet and sedentary habits appearing to be the main drivers. Since obesity is a disease in and of itself, managing it becomes more difficult when it coexists with other pathological illnesses including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and psychological disorders. Furthermore, childhood overweight and obesity have been shown to persist into adulthood, and their related adverse outcomes include not only certain health conditions in childhood, but also a greater risk and earlier onset of chronic disorders in later life. Hence, there is a demand for routine surveillance of weight status in children and adolescents.

There has been a dearth of studies into the prevalence of obesity among children and adolescents from global perspective since the Non-Communicable Diseases Risk Factor Collaborationreported an estimation of 5.6% of girls and 7.8% of boys with obesity in 2016. The present study pooled a larger and more recent set of national surveys than previously reported to estimate global prevalence as well as risk factors and comorbidities associated with overweight and obesity among children and adolescents under 18 years old from 2000 to 2023.

### Severe obesity in children and adolescents: identification, associated health risks, and treatment approaches: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^233f9bc7]. Circulation (2013). Low credibility.

Severe obesity afflicts between 4% and 6% of all youth in the United States, and the prevalence is increasing. Despite the serious immediate and long-term cardiovascular, metabolic, and other health consequences of severe pediatric obesity, current treatments are limited in effectiveness and lack widespread availability. Lifestyle modification/behavior-based treatment interventions in youth with severe obesity have demonstrated modest improvement in body mass index status, but participants have generally remained severely obese and often regained weight after the conclusion of the treatment programs. The role of medical management is minimal, because only 1 medication is currently approved for the treatment of obesity in adolescents. Bariatric surgery has generally been effective in reducing body mass index and improving cardiovascular and metabolic risk factors; however, reports of long-term outcomes are few, many youth with severe obesity do not qualify for surgery, and access is limited by lack of insurance coverage. To begin to address these challenges, the purposes of this scientific statement are to (1) provide justification for and recommend a standardized definition of severe obesity in children and adolescents; (2) raise awareness of this serious and growing problem by summarizing the current literature in this area in terms of the epidemiology and trends, associated health risks (immediate and long-term), and challenges and shortcomings of currently available treatment options; and (3) highlight areas in need of future research. Innovative behavior-based treatment, minimally invasive procedures, and medications currently under development all need to be evaluated for their efficacy and safety in this group of patients with high medical and psychosocial risks.

### Obesity management in children and adolescents [^96bb0d26]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Obesity in the pediatric population is increasing in the United States and globally. Childhood obesity is associated with cardiometabolic and psychosocial comorbidities and decreased overall life span. The cause of pediatric obesity is multifactorial and includes genetic predisposition, lifestyle, behavioral patterns, and consequences of social determinants of health. Routine screening of BMI and comorbid conditions is essential to identifying patients who require treatment. The AAP recommends immediate Intensive Health Behavior and Lifestyle Treatment for children with obesity, encompassing lifestyle changes, behavioral changes, and mental health treatments. Pharmacologic interventions and metabolic and bariatric surgery are also available when indicated.

### Expert committee recommendations regarding the prevention, assessment, and treatment of child and adolescent overweight and obesity: summary report [^274cc799]. Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

To revise 1998 recommendations on childhood obesity, an Expert Committee, comprised of representatives from 15 professional organizations, appointed experienced scientists and clinicians to 3 writing groups to review the literature and recommend approaches to prevention, assessment, and treatment. Because effective strategies remain poorly defined, the writing groups used both available evidence and expert opinion to develop the recommendations. Primary care providers should universally assess children for obesity risk to improve early identification of elevated BMI, medical risks, and unhealthy eating and physical activity habits. Providers can provide obesity prevention messages for most children and suggest weight control interventions for those with excess weight. The writing groups also recommend changing office systems so that they support efforts to address the problem. BMI should be calculated and plotted at least annually, and the classification should be integrated with other information such as growth pattern, familial obesity, and medical risks to assess the child's obesity risk. For prevention, the recommendations include both specific eating and physical activity behaviors, which are likely to promote maintenance of healthy weight, but also the use of patient-centered counseling techniques such as motivational interviewing, which helps families identify their own motivation for making change. For assessment, the recommendations include methods to screen for current medical conditions and for future risks, and methods to assess diet and physical activity behaviors. For treatment, the recommendations propose 4 stages of obesity care; the first is brief counseling that can be delivered in a health care office, and subsequent stages require more time and resources. The appropriateness of higher stages is influenced by a patient's age and degree of excess weight. These recommendations recognize the importance of social and environmental change to reduce the obesity epidemic but also identify ways healthcare providers and health care systems can be part of broader efforts.

### Tackling obesity while preventing obesity stigma [^ab3dd537]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2024). Medium credibility.

Obesity is a significant public health problem. Prevalence is rising in children and young people, with lifelong health impacts and implications for paediatric clinical practice. Obesity stigma is increasingly acknowledged as a problem within health services. Health professionals can inadvertently contribute to this stigma, which is harmful and in itself can promote weight gain. A complex web of factors contributes to obesity, and a simplistic approach exclusively focused on personal responsibility, diet and exercise is unhelpful. A more nuanced, sensitive and informed approach is needed, with careful use of language and non-judgemental partnership working.

### Evidence-based behavioral treatment of obesity in children and adolescents [^5a8d1a43]. Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Obesity is the most common childhood disease and is widely acknowledged as having become a global epidemic. Well-recognized health consequences of childhood obesity exist, both during childhood and adulthood, affecting health and psychological and economic welfare. The importance of finding effective strategies for the management of childhood obesity has international significance with the publication of various expert reports and evidence-based guidelines in recent years.

### Executive summary: clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and treatment of children and adolescents with obesity [^630acb13]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

American Academy of Pediatrics pediatric obesity clinical practice guideline — introduction and scope states that obesity is a common, complex, and often persistent chronic disease associated with serious health and social consequences if not treated, yet treatment of obesity can be successful. The current and long-term health of 14.4 million children and adolescents is affected by obesity, making it one of the most common pediatric chronic diseases in the United States. The document notes that obesity has long been stigmatized as a reversible consequence of personal choices but has, in reality, complex genetic, physiologic, socioeconomic, and environmental contributors, and highlights increased understanding of the impact of social determinants of health (SDoHs) and of obesity-related comorbidities on both obesity risk and treatment. This clinical practice guideline (CPG) aims to inform pediatricians and other pediatric health care providers (PHCPs) about the standard of care for evaluating and treating children with overweight and obesity and related comorbidities and promotes an approach that considers the child's health status, family system, community context, and resources for treatment to create the best evidence-based treatment plan. The medical home should coordinate the evaluation and treatment of obesity and related conditions.

### Childhood obesity and the associated rise in cardiometabolic complications [^35454b54]. Nature Metabolism (2020). High credibility.

Childhood obesity is one of the most serious global public-health challenges of the twenty-first century. Over the past four decades, the number of children and adolescents with obesity has risen more than tenfold. Worldwide, an increasing number of youth are facing greater exposure to obesity throughout their lives, and this increase will contribute to the early development of type 2 diabetes, fatty liver and cardiovascular complications. Herein, we provide a brief overview of trends in the global shifts in, and environmental and genetic determinants of, childhood obesity. We then discuss recent progress in the elucidation of the central role of insulin resistance, the key element linking obesity and cardiovascular-risk-factor clustering, and the potential mechanisms through which ectopic lipid accumulation leads to insulin resistance and its associated cardiometabolic complications in obese adolescents. In the absence of effective prevention and intervention programs, childhood obesity will have severe public-health consequences for decades to come.

### Clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and treatment of children and adolescents with obesity [^9acd43ef]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) clinical practice guideline — introduction and scope — notes burden, chronic-disease recognition, and population coverage. The current and long-term health of 14.4 million children and adolescents is affected by obesity, and prior acknowledgments include the National Institutes of Health designating obesity as a chronic disease in 1998 and the American Medical Association recognizing it as a complex, chronic disease in 2013. This is the AAP's first clinical practice guideline outlining evidence-based evaluation and treatment of children and adolescents with overweight and obesity. The guideline does not cover the prevention of obesity and does not include guidance for overweight and obesity evaluation and treatment of children younger than 2 years; children under the age of 2 were not part of the inclusion criteria for the evidence review because it is difficult to practically define and measure excess adiposity in this age group. Related prior work referenced includes the "Algorithm for the Assessment and Management of Childhood Obesity" in 2016.

### Childhood obesity: aetiology, comorbidities, and treatment [^8d0d05b4]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Obesity is currently considered a global epidemic, and its implications in mortality and morbidity in a paediatric patient and in adulthood are increasingly important. The objective of this article is to review in detail the definition of obesity according to age group, and, in turn, the epidemiology of this entity worldwide and in South America. Available evidence about pathophysiology and, additionally, associated comorbidities are reported in some of the most important and clinically relevant body systems. The recommendations on pharmacological and nonpharmacological management through changes in lifestyle and relevant aspects of bariatric surgery in the paediatric population are also described.

### Overview of pediatric obesity as a disease [^7925ba36]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

The authors highlight well-known and hypothesized pathophysiologic mechanistic links underlying obesity and the various pediatric disorders across multiple organ systems with which it is associated. Obesity is attributed to an imbalance in energy intake versus expenditure; there is growing knowledge regarding its multifactorial origins, dysfunctional physiologic processes, and adverse health consequences. Individuals with obesity exhibit variations in metabolic rate, genetic predisposition, and hormonal regulation, influencing diverse responses in regulating energy balance. Understanding the complex mechanistic relationships surrounding the pathophysiology of obesity assists in its consideration as a disease process, allowing pediatric health practitioners to manage its sequelae more effectively.

### Clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and treatment of children and adolescents with obesity [^0b65b9ae]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Chronic disease and obesity definitions — CDC and Obesity Medicine Association (OMA) — are presented as follows: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defines chronic diseases broadly as "conditions that last 1 year or more and require ongoing medical attention or limit activities of daily living or both". Obesity is described as "a chronic disease that results in altered anatomy, physiology, and metabolism — all of which adversely affect the physical and mental health trajectory of children and adolescents", and the Obesity Medicine Association defines obesity as a "chronic, relapsing, multifactorial, neurobehavioral disease, wherein an increase in body fat promotes adipose tissue dysfunction and abnormal fat mass physical forces, resulting in adverse metabolic, biomechanical, and psychosocial health consequences".

### Health state preferences associated with weight status in children and adolescents [^6e78e75a]. BMC Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Childhood obesity is a substantial public health problem. The extent to which health state preferences (utilities) are related to a child's weight status has not been reported. The aims of this study were (1) to use a generic health state classification system to measure health related quality of life and calculate health utilities in a convenience sample of children and adolescents and (2) to determine the extent to which these measures are associated with weight status and body mass index (BMI).

Methods

We enrolled 76 children 5–18 years of age from a primary care clinic and an obesity clinic in Boston MA. We administered the Health Utilities Index (HUI) and used the HUI Mark 3 single- and multi-attribute utility functions to calculate health utilities. We determined BMI percentile and weight status based on CDC references. We examined single-attribute and overall utilities in relation to weight status and BMI.

Results

Mean (range) age was 10.8 (5–18) years. Mean (SD) BMI percentile was 76 (26); 55% of children were overweight or obese. The mean (SD) overall utility was 0.79 (0.17) in the entire sample. For healthy-weight children, the mean overall utility was higher than for overweight or obese children (0.81 vs. 0.78), but the difference was not statistically significant (difference 0.04, 95% CI -0.04, 0.11).

Conclusions

Our results provide a quantitative estimate of the health utility associated with overweight and obesity in children, and will be helpful to researchers performing cost effectiveness analyses of interventions to prevent and/or treat childhood obesity.

### Childhood obesity: causes, consequences, and management [^398f2b85]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

One-third of North American children are overweight or obese. Pathologic obesity accounts for only a small percentage of these cases. The vast majority are the result of a complex interaction of genetic and hormonal, nutritional, physical activity, and physical and social environmental factors. Obesity increases the risk for various cardiometabolic, pulmonary, and psychosocial complications for children, which often continues into adulthood. Multidisciplinary care, focusing on family-centered behavior change, is an evidence-based, essential part of the treatment, along with pharmacologic and surgical options for more complex cases. Prevention and early intervention strategies are key to reversing the obesity epidemic.

The prevention of pediatric obesity by promoting healthful diet, activity, and environment should be a primary goal, as achieving effective, long-lasting results with lifestyle modification once obesity occurs is difficult. The use of weight loss medications during childhood and adolescence should be restricted to clinical trials.

### Factors associated with the effectiveness of interventions to prevent obesity in children: a synthesis of evidence from 204 randomised trials [^61c916f4]. BMJ Public Health (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Rising population levels of childhood overweight and obesity present a global challenge, with profound implications for public health and health services. Children and adolescents living with obesity are more likely to experience reduced health-related quality of life and, for adolescents, a number of comorbidities. It is, therefore, important to prevent childhood obesity, both to ensure good long-term physical and mental health and to help children realise their full potential. Prevention requires effective interventions to change behaviour in relation to dietary habits and physical activity. Such behavioural change interventions typically contain multiple techniques or components, which may act individually or in combination to determine the effectiveness of the intervention.

We recently conducted two Cochrane systematic reviews of 244 randomised controlled trials of behavioural change interventions aimed at preventing obesity in children (aged 5 to 11 years and 12 to 18 years, respectively). Interventions were grouped according to whether they targeted physical activity, diet or both. While we found some modest beneficial effects, on average, of physical activity interventions, either alone or in combination with diet, there remained substantial between-trial variability in results across trials within each of the broad comparisons. This heterogeneity is most likely caused by variation in the characteristics of interventions included in each category. The characteristics varied in many different dimensions, including whether they targeted diet or physical activity or both, the degree of home (family) engagement, the degree of active participation by the children, the number of different strategies employed concurrently, the mode of delivery, the intensity and the duration.

In this paper, we report results of a re-analysis of these trials using all types of BMI outcomes reported, age groups (5–18 years) and follow-up times in a single comprehensive analysis. Our aim is to identify characteristics of these behavioural change interventions that are most strongly associated with their effectiveness in preventing obesity in children. We employ an analytic framework co-produced with stakeholders, statistical methods for mapping different outcomes onto a single measurement scaleand a bespoke complex meta-regression model.

### Childhood obesity and cardiovascular dysfunction [^2ca63c8f]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

Obesity-related cardiovascular disease in children is becoming more prevalent in conjunction with the rise in childhood obesity. Children with obesity are predisposed to an increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in adulthood. Importantly, research in children with obesity over the last decade has demonstrated that children may exhibit early signs of cardiovascular dysfunction as a result of their excess adiposity, often independent of other obesity-related comorbidities such as dyslipidemia and insulin resistance. The clinical evidence is accumulating to suggest that the cardiovascular damage, once observed only in adults, is also occurring in obese children. The objective of this review is to provide a synopsis of the current research on cardiovascular abnormalities in children with obesity and highlight the importance and need for early detection and prevention programs to mitigate this potentially serious health problem.

### The epidemiological burden of obesity in childhood: a worldwide epidemic requiring urgent action [^fe424832]. BMC Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Excess weight during childhood and adolescence remains one of the most important issues in global health, despite emerging as a concern several decades ago. Recent estimates suggest that 40 million children under the age of 5 years and more than 330 million children and adolescents aged 5–19 years were overweight or obese in 2016. Given the global emergency posed by excess weight in children, member states of the World Health Organization (WHO) endorsed "no increase in childhood overweight by 2025" as one of the six global nutrition targets in the 'Comprehensive Implementation Plan for Maternal, Infant and Young Child Nutrition'. This is consistent with the same target for obesity and diabetes between 2010 and 2025 in the 'WHO Global Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of Non-communicable Diseases 2013–2020'.

Overweight or obesity during childhood has important short-term and long-term consequences. In the short term, children who are overweight or obese are more likely to suffer from psychological comorbidities such as depression, anxiety, low self-esteem, a series of emotional and behavioural disorders, asthma, low-grade systemic inflammation, liver complications, and musculoskeletal problems, especially in the lower extremities. Children who are overweight and obese also have more metabolic and cardiovascular risk factors, such as high blood pressure, dyslipidaemia, type 2 diabetes and other abnormalities of the cardiovascular system. In the long term, overweight or obesity during childhood increases the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, some cancers, and musculoskeletal disorders in adulthood, which can lead to disability and premature death. In addition, the treatment of obesity in adulthood is difficult, with evidence suggesting that around three-quarters of children who are overweight or obese carry this status into adulthood. Strong persistence of overweight status and low efficacy of available treatments highlight the need to prevent overweight and obesity at the earliest possible stage of life.

### Antibiotics, obesity and the link to microbes-what are we doing to our children? [^0e1c5816]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The increasing prevalence of childhood obesity is one of the greatest challenges facing medical professionals caring for infants and children. According to a recent report from the United States, more than one in six children and youths between the ages of two and 19 years are obese and more than one in three are overweight. Overweight and obese children are at a high risk of becoming obese adults. The detrimental health consequences of obesity – increased risk of metabolic and cardiovascular disease, musculoskeletal problems as well as psychosocial issues – may manifest already in childhood and become more prevalent with increasing age. Effective strategies for reducing the risk of obesity are desperately needed. Devising such means is dependent on an improved understanding of the factors involved in obesity development. Recent data suggest that the developmental pathway leading to obesity may begin already in infancy and that childhood overweight is a strong predictor of later obesity. Early life programming towards a phenotype prone to obesity may occur as a result of intrauterine or extrauterine influences, some of which may be amenable to intervention. As discussed in detail below, reducing antibiotic exposure in the perinatal period or in early infancy, which has recently been associated with an increased risk of obesity development, may be one means of combatting the obesity epidemic.

### The role of the pediatrician in primary prevention of obesity [^e8b8923f]. Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

Summary points for pediatric primary prevention of obesity — The adoption and maintenance of healthful lifestyles must be emphasized as the basis for the prevention of obesity and other chronic health conditions; prevention of childhood obesity remains a public health priority, because obesity is the most prevalent chronic health condition in the pediatric population, and although many social sectors need to be mobilized to completely address this problem, pediatric primary care has a unique role to play, should be a resource for the community, and can be an integral part of the solution; to address obesity prevention effectively in clinical practice, pediatricians should become familiar with the complex and interconnected factors that lead to excessive weight gain.

### Clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and treatment of children and adolescents with obesity [^f491e9a9]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

A. Health equity considerations — Differences in disease prevalence and outcomes are often labeled disparities, but disparity only defines differences between groups and does not address inequities that cause these differences, which include economic, civil-political, cultural, or environmental conditions required for parity and equity. Because inequities intertwine across the life course, health disparities occur from maternal pregnancy outcomes through adolescence and can impact childhood obesity. This distinction is important in chronic disease because obesity risk factors are embedded in the socioecological and environmental fabric of children's lives, and there is a danger of stigmatizing children with obesity and their families on the basis of race and ethnicity, age, and gender based on disparities of outcome without recognizing systemic challenges that cause and maintain inequities. Inequities are often associated with each other and result in disparities in obesity risk and outcomes.

- Obesity affects some groups more than others, including adolescents, Hispanic and non-Hispanic Black children, and children in families with lower incomes.
- Health care for obesity is expensive for patients and the health care system. Many U. S. children have obesity From 2017 to March 2020, the prevalence of obesity among U. S. children and adolescents was 19. 7%. This means that approximately 14. 7 million U. S. youths aged 2–19 years have obesity. For children, obesity is defined as having a body mass index at or above the 95th percentile for age and sex. Obesity affects some groups more than others The prevalence of obesity increased with age. From 2017 to March 2020, obesity prevalence was 12. 7% among U. S. children 2–5 years old, 20. 7% among those 6–11, and
22. 2% among adolescents 12–19. Overall, obesity prevalence was highest in Hispanic children and non-Hispanic Black children followed by non-Hispanic white and non-Hispanic Asian children. Among U. S. girls, obesity prevalence was highest among non-Hispanic Black girls. Among U. S. boys, obesity prevalence was highest among Hispanic boys. Obesity prevalence increased as family income decreased. Obesity prevalence was:

- 11. 5% among U. S. children with family income more than 350% of the Federal Poverty Level.

Introduction

Childhood obesity is a condition which, throughout the last 100 years, has transformed from a sign of wealth and health to a disease that according to the WHO is "one of the most serious challenges of the 21 st century". There are several reasons for the WHO statement. According to the Global Burden of Disease Study, health hazards — such as global exposure to unsafe sanitation, household air pollution, childhood underweight, childhood stunting, and smoking — decreased by more than 25% between 1990 and 2015. During the same period, risks associated with high body‐mass index (BMI) increased by more than 25%. The prevalence of obesity has doubled in more than 70 countries since 1980. A total of 107.7 million children had obesity in 2015.

Childhood and adolescent obesity is associated with increased risk of premature death. Many factors contribute, such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes (T2D), and several endocrine disorders, as well as depression and cognitive disturbances that may contribute to poor school results. Almost all organ systems are affected by obesity in childhood (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1
Diseases and conditions caused or aggravated by obesity during childhood and adolescence. Childhood obesity is a systemic disease and almost all organs in the body are potentially affected.

An additional concern for children with obesity is the negative effects obesity may have on social interaction. Bullying is common, and the negative attitudes toward children with obesity may increase the risks for eating disorders, social isolation, and reduced physical activity. Childhood obesity is today associated with stigma to such a degree that, despite it being considered a disease, the health care system is requested to not call the disease "obesity" but to use nonbiased language such as "weight" and "body mass index". There is also a powerful "body activism" movement claiming that obesity is not a disease and that the "medicalization" of someone's body is harmful. Consequently, children with obesity should be left alone and treatment postponed. Although such a statement will be misleading, it is important to carefully evaluate the psychosocial risks of stigmatization associated with childhood obesity treatment and compare these risks with the potential health benefits of successful treatment.

In this article, we will go through the long‐term medical and psychosocial consequences of childhood obesity and discuss to what extent comorbidity markers during childhood are associated with disease in adulthood. We will demonstrate how much can be gained if effective treatment of obesity is initiated already during childhood.

Cosponsoring Associations

The European Society of Endocrinology and the Pediatric Endocrine Society. This guideline was funded by the Endocrine Society.

Objective

To formulate clinical practice guidelines for the assessment, treatment, and prevention of pediatric obesity.

Participants

The participants include an Endocrine Society-appointed Task Force of 6 experts, a methodologist, and a medical writer.

Evidence

This evidence-based guideline was developed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach to describe the strength of recommendations and the quality of evidence. The Task Force commissioned 2 systematic reviews and used the best available evidence from other published systematic reviews and individual studies.

Consensus Process

One group meeting, several conference calls, and e-mail communications enabled consensus. Endocrine Society committees and members and co-sponsoring organizations reviewed and commented on preliminary drafts of this guideline.

Conclusion

Pediatric obesity remains an ongoing serious international health concern affecting ∼17% of US children and adolescents, threatening their adult health and longevity. Pediatric obesity has its basis in genetic susceptibilities influenced by a permissive environment starting in utero and extending through childhood and adolescence. Endocrine etiologies for obesity are rare and usually are accompanied by attenuated growth patterns. Pediatric comorbidities are common and long-term health complications often result; screening for comorbidities of obesity should be applied in a hierarchal, logical manner for early identification before more serious complications result. Genetic screening for rare syndromes is indicated only in the presence of specific historical or physical features. The psychological toll of pediatric obesity on the individual and family necessitates screening for mental health issues and counseling as indicated. The prevention of pediatric obesity by promoting healthful diet, activity, and environment should be a primary goal, as achieving effective, long-lasting results with lifestyle modification once obesity occurs is difficult. Although some behavioral and pharmacotherapy studies report modest success, additional research into accessible and effective methods for preventing and treating pediatric obesity is needed. The use of weight loss medications during childhood and adolescence should be restricted to clinical trials. Increasing evidence demonstrates the effectiveness of bariatric surgery in the most seriously affected mature teenagers who have failed lifestyle modification, but the use of surgery requires experienced teams with resources for long-term follow-up. Adolescents undergoing lifestyle therapy, medication regimens, or bariatric surgery for obesity will need cohesive planning to help them effectively transition to adult care, with continued necessary monitoring, support, and intervention. Transition programs for obesity are an uncharted area requiring further research for efficacy. Despite a significant increase in research on pediatric obesity since the initial publication of these guidelines 8 years ago, further study is needed of the genetic and biological factors that increase the risk of weight gain and influence the response to therapeutic interventions. Also needed are more studies to better understand the genetic and biological factors that cause an obese individual to manifest one comorbidity vs another or to be free of comorbidities. Furthermore, continued investigation into the most effective methods of preventing and treating obesity and into methods for changing environmental and economic factors that will lead to worldwide cultural changes in diet and activity should be priorities. Particular attention to determining ways to effect systemic changes in food environments and total daily mobility, as well as methods for sustaining healthy body mass index changes, is of importance.

### Special considerations in childhood and adolescent obesity [^3fd41be7]. Clinics in Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Child and adolescent obesity is increasingly prevalent in westernized countries. It is associated with significant medical and psychosocial co-morbidities that are both immediate and long-term. While genetic factors influence the susceptibility of a given child to an obesity-conducive environment, the current epidemic is due to massive environmental change over the past few decades leading to a rise in sedentary pursuits, a decrease in physical activity and increased energy intake. Effective management requires a family-focused, developmentally sensitive, behavioural management approach that addresses, for example, eating habits, incidental activity and television viewing. Prevention of childhood obesity will ultimately require multi-faceted, large-scale interventions.

### Addressing childhood obesity through increased physical activity [^62c1d81d]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2010). Medium credibility.

Obesity is affecting an increasing proportion of children globally. Despite an appreciation that physical activity is essential for the normal growth and development of children and prevents obesity and obesity-related health problems, too few children are physically active. A concurrent problem is that today's young people spend more time than previous generations did in sedentary pursuits, including watching television and engaging in screen-based games. Active behavior has been displaced by these inactive recreational choices, which has contributed to reductions in activity-related energy expenditure. Implementation of multifactorial solutions considered to offer the best chance of combating these trends is urgently required to redress the energy imbalance that characterizes obesity. The counterproductive 'shame and blame' mentality that apportions responsibility for the childhood obesity problem to sufferers, their parents, teachers or health-care providers needs to be changed. Instead, these groups should offer constant support and encouragement to promote appropriate physical activity in children. Failure to provide activity opportunities will increase the likelihood that the children of today will live less healthy (and possibly shorter) lives than their parents.

Introduction

The prevalence of childhood obesity remains a high priority for public health policy in most high- and middle-income countries. In the last two decades since the World Health Organization declared the global nature of the obesity epidemic, the prevalence of unhealthy weight has continued to increase. In 2016 it was estimated that 340 million children aged 5–19 years were overweight or obese. Additionally, recent surveillance data suggests there has been a sharp increase in the prevalence of obesity in school-aged children during the COVID-19 pandemic in some countries.

Unhealthy weight contributes enormously to the global burden of disease, increasing the risk of many health conditions (including cancer and cardiovascular disease), and was responsible for 4.7 million premature deaths in 2017 and between 0.7% and 2.8% of national health care costs. Childhood obesity is linked with a range of adverse physical, mental health and societal outcomes, and children living with obesity are at a greater risk of being overweight and having life-limiting comorbidities in adulthood. Allowing childhood obesity levels to rise further will likely translate into major health and economic challenges for future generations — not least vulnerability to pandemic outbreaks of viruses like COVID-19, for which overweight is an important risk factor. Strategies to prevent unhealthy weight gain in children therefore represent a key strategy to mitigate this burden.

Healthy weight promotion in children is addressed by various international strategies and policy frameworks, which make recommendations for action to support healthy weight across settings. To ensure that governments are enacting policies that have the greatest impact on health outcomes, it is essential that such policies are based on the most recent and robust evidence available. The evidence-base regarding childhood obesity prevention has increased markedly in recent years. The most recent Cochrane review of obesity prevention interventions targeting children 0–18 years identified 153 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to 2015, and another 315 potentially eligible trials (not synthesized) up to January 2018. This increasing volume of research enables precise estimates of obesity prevention interventions effects and importantly affords the opportunity to examine the effects of interventions in different settings, populations, and different duration and componentry to guide the development of appropriate and effective obesity prevention initiatives. Additionally, policy makers and practitioners require information regarding adverse impacts of intervention options, and their delivery costs. This information is largely absent within existing reviews.

### Effects of lifestyle interventions on mental health in children and adolescents with overweight or obesity: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^4f3b5bd3]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Overweight and obesity, characterized by an excessive accumulation of body fat, have emerged as considerable global health concerns, particularly among children and adolescents. Recent estimates from the World Health Organization (WHO) indicate that over 340 million children and adolescents with overweight or obesity were identified in 2022. This alarming trend is observed across diverse geographical and socioeconomic contexts, with significant implications for both individual health and public health systems. The health consequences of childhood obesity are extensive, including an increased risk of chronic diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and metabolic disorders. Furthermore, these health challenges can lead to long-term economic burdens on healthcare systems and decreased quality of life for affected individuals.

Childhood represents a critical period for physiological, psychological, and social development, and in addition to the physical risks associated with obesity, mental health disorders among children and adolescents have emerged as a global crisis. According to the WHO, one in seven individuals aged 10–19 years is affected by a mental health disorder, underscoring the urgent need to prioritize mental health in public health agendas. The impact of poor mental health extends beyond individual well-being, placing substantial pressure on healthcare systems, educational institutions, and broader societal structures. Moreover, rising social and environmental stressors have exacerbated inequalities and driven a rise in mental health challenges among young people. Given that mental illnesses are conceptualised as chronic disorders of young people, addressing these issues during early developmental stages has emerged as a global health priority.

### What are parents worried about? Health problems and health concerns for children [^398334d2]. Clinical Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Patient-centered care requires pediatricians to address parents' health concerns, but their willingness to solicit parental concerns may be limited by uncertainty about which topics will be raised. The authors conducted surveys of parents to identify current health-related issues of concern.

Methods

Participants rated 30 items as health problems for children in their community (large, medium, small, or no problem) and volunteered concerns for their own children.

Results

A total of 1119 parents completed the survey. Allergies (69%), lack of exercise (68%), asthma (65%), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (65%), Internet safety (63%), obesity (59%), smoking (58%), and bullying (57%) were identified as important problems (large or medium) with variation among demographic subgroups. Concerns for their own children included healthy nutrition; obesity; lack of exercise, healthy growth and development; safety and injury prevention; and mental health issues.

Conclusion

Parents' health concerns for children are varied and may differ from those routinely addressed during well-child care.

### Actions and programs of European countries to combat obesity in children and adolescents: a survey [^3e52b450]. International Journal of Obesity (2005). Low credibility.

In view of the dramatically increasing prevalence of obesity among European children and adolescents and its comorbidities, the EU and national health authorities are confronted with a major public health problem, starting in childhood. So far, little is known about policies and prevention programs that are planned and implemented in EU member states in order to combat childhood obesity epidemic. For this reason all 25 Ministries of Health have been asked to give a report on their activities in that specific field. In all, 19 ministries responded and provided information on their measures in varying detail. Taken together, it shows that most ministries are aware of that severe problem and different kind of 'National Action plans against Obesity' have been recently established. However, in most cases no detailed information about the realization and the effectiveness of these programs were given. Thus, there is an urgent need for specific actions both at national and European levels in regard to succeed in fighting childhood obesity.

### Pediatric obesity [^823db7df]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Childhood obesity is a tremendous burden for children, their families, and society. Obesity prevention remains the ultimate goal but rapid development and deployment of effective nonsurgical treatment options is not currently achievable given the complexity of this disease. Surgical options for adolescent obesity have been proven to be safe and effective and should be offered. The development of stratified protocols of increasing intensity should be individualized for patients based on their disease severity and risk factors. These protocols should be offered in multidisciplinary, cooperative clinical trials to critically evaluate and develop optimal treatment strategies for morbid obesity.

### Evaluating obesity and cardiovascular risk factors in children and adolescents [^e3cae9b1]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Obesity continues to be a growing public health problem. According to the 2003–2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 17 percent of persons two to 19 years of age are overweight. The number of obese children and adolescents has tripled in the past 20 years. Obesity in adults is associated with cardiovascular risk factors including hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes. The growing prevalence of overweight in children and adolescents is paralleled by the growth of its associated complications in that population: hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and metabolic syndrome. A modification of the metabolic syndrome criteria designed for children and adolescents shows that as many as 50 percent of those who are severely overweight have the syndrome. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force has not found sufficient evidence to support screening children for obesity or other cardiovascular risk factors. The American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Heart Association have adopted a more aggressive stance, based largely on consensus opinion. Current suggestions include focusing on children whose body mass indexes exceed the 85th percentile; who are rapidly gaining weight; who have a family history of type 2 diabetes or hypercholesterolemia; or who have hypertension or signs of insulin resistance. Physician advocacy for healthy communities and institutions that foster physical activity, good eating habits, and healthy lifestyles is also encouraged.

### Healthcare and childhood obesity… [^958785dd]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Healthcare providers, health plans, delivery systems, and information technologies all play a role in supporting children's healthy growth and the prevention and treatment of obesity. Prevention and care management options are needed in clinics and hospital-based settings. Healthcare can address childhood obesity by providing proven health services, complemented by community resources, systems changes, programs, and policies. The US Preventive Services Task Force and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommend screening children for obesity and offering prevention or treatment services. The US Preventive Services Task Force recommends screening children and adolescents 6 years and older for obesity, and offering or referring those with obesity to family-centered, comprehensive, intensive behavioral interventions to promote improvements in weight status.

Family Healthy Weight Programs Guideline-based care effectively treats obesity but is not available to most children with excess weight. Evidence-based recommendations for children with obesity include referral to a family healthy weight program. Reported barriers to providing access to these programs include availability, cost, and insurance reimbursement. 1–3 The following are tools and resources that can be used in healthcare settings to prevent and treat childhood obesity. CDC Child and Teen Body Mass Index Calculator Provides body mass index and corresponding BMI-for-age percentile based on CDC growth charts for children and teens ages 2 through 19 years. American Academy of Pediatrics Best-Practice Tools Clinical supports for obesity prevention, assessment, and treatment best-practices in patients 2 years and older. AAP's Bright Futures health promotion and prevention initiative also includes guidance on child obesity prevention during well-child visits.

Referrals to Community Resources Patient prescription or referral to community resources that support families in healthy eating, active living, and improving social determinants of health.

### A recent update on childhood obesity: aetiology, treatment and complications [^b9a03a93]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Obesity is a complex, chronic condition characterised by excess adiposity. Rates of obesity in childhood and adolescence are increasing worldwide, with a corresponding increase in adulthood. The aetiology of obesity is multifactorial and results from a combination of endocrine, genetic, environmental and societal factors. Population level approaches to reduce the prevalence of childhood obesity worldwide are urgently needed. There are wide-ranging complications from excess weight affecting every system in the body, which lead to significant morbidity and reduced life expectancy. Treatment of obesity and its complications requires a multi-faceted, biopsychosocial approach incorporating dietary, exercise and psychological treatments. Pharmacological treatments for treating childhood obesity have recently become available, and there is further development of new anti-obesity medications in the pipeline. In addition, bariatric surgery is being increasingly recognised as a treatment option for obesity in adolescence providing the potential to reverse complications related to excess weight. In this review, we present an update on the prevalence, aetiology, complications and treatment of childhood obesity.

### Medical and non-medical complications among children and adolescents with excessive body weight [^3e9c98ec]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Children with body weight excess are an important high risk group for health complications. This population suffers already at an early age of multiple complications leading to increased health risks and costs in adult life.

However, there are disparities in epidemiological data, depending on where the studies are performed, the selected populations and the clinical settings. Indeed, most childhood obesity co-morbidities are rare in the general population, but are likely to be of increasing importance as even if stabilizing, the prevalence of childhood obesity in our country is still of 20%. Therefore, it is important to collect data from a clinical population to evaluate their prevalence. To our knowledge, no studies have investigated the concomitant occurrence of medical (cardiovascular, metabolic, orthopedic) and non-medical complications in a large sample of overweight or obese children and adolescents. Therefore, we aimed first at determining the prevalence of obesity-related co-morbidities in a cohort of children with body weight excess consulting in a specialized obesity center and second at comparing those complications between overweight, obese and extremely obese subjects. We hypothesized that the numbers of complications increase with weight status.

In this issue of JAMA, the US Preventive Services Task Force releases updated recommendations for interventions for high body mass index in children and adolescents. 1 Child and adolescent obesity continues to be one of the most significant health challenges in the US and globally. In 2017–2020, 19. 7% of US children and adolescents aged 2 to 19 years had obesity, 2 and the rate of BMI increase nearly doubled during the first 9 months of the COVID-19 pandemic. 3 Obesity is associated with significant social, psychological, and medical burdens among children, as well as increased risks of adult obesity, diabetes, heart disease and stroke, many cancers, many other chronic illnesses, and early mortality. Youth from low socioeconomic status families and Black, Hispanic, or Indigenous youth have higher rates of obesity and its related comorbidities. 2, 4, 5 Robinson TN, Armstrong SC.

### Clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and treatment of children and adolescents with obesity [^5e9306e8]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

II. Approach — Childhood obesity results from a multifactorial set of socioecological, environmental, and genetic influences, with risk increased among children exposed to adversity and social determinants of health (SDOHs) such as racism; overweight and obesity are more common in children who live in poverty, underresourced communities, immigrated families, or those who experience discrimination or stigma, and obesity does not affect all population groups equally, highlighting the need to understand SDOHs and the social context in care. Children with overweight and obesity benefit from health behavior and lifestyle treatment as a child-focused, family-centered, coordinated approach to care, coordinated by a patient-centered medical home, which may involve pediatricians; registered dietitian nutritionists (RDNs); psychologists; nurses; exercise specialists; social workers; families; schools; communities; and health policy. Because obesity is a chronic disease with escalating effects over time, a life course approach to identification and treatment should begin as early as possible and continue longitudinally through childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood, with transition into adult care; obesity is long-lasting with persistent negative health effects, attributable morbidity and mortality, and social and economic consequences impacting quality of life.

### Childhood obesity: highlights of AMA expert committee recommendations [^2058fa7d]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Childhood obesity is an increasingly serious problem; 13.9 percent of children two to five years of age, 18.8 percent of children six to 11 years of age, and 17.4 percent of adolescents 12 to 19 years of age in America are obese. Practical strategies that primary care physicians can use to tackle the problem are scarce. The American Medical Association recently convened an expert panel to address this need. Evidence about how best to manage and prevent obesity was reviewed and incorporated into a series of reports. The Expert Committee on the Assessment, Prevention, and Treatment of Child and Adolescent Overweight and Obesity recommends addressing the issue of weight with all children at least once a year. Family physicians are urged to assess key dietary habits (e.g., consumption of sweetened beverages), physical activity habits, readiness to change lifestyle habits, and family history of obesity and obesity-related illnesses. Laboratory testing recommendations depend on the degree of obesity and associated illnesses. For children with a body mass index between the 85th and 94th percentiles but who have no obesity-related illnesses, a fasting lipid profile should be done. Those with the same body mass index and obesity-related illnesses should also have tests for alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, and fasting blood glucose levels. Measurement of blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels should be added in children with a body mass index above the 95th percentile. A four-stage approach to treatment of childhood obesity is recommended. Many of these recommendations can be carried out by family physicians for treatment and prevention. These include advising families to limit consumption of sweetened beverages and fast food, limit screen time, engage in physical activity for at least 60 minutes per day, and encourage family meals on most, and preferably all, days of the week.

### Introduction and methodology: standards of care in overweight and obesity – 2025 [^a5ed9fab]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2025). High credibility.

Obesity is a chronic, relapsing, and progressive disease requiring long-term, interprofessional treatment strategies to improve health outcomes. With over 40% of US adults and nearly 20% of children affected, obesity remains a significant public health concern. Despite the American Medical Association's recognition of obesity as a chronic disease, gaps persist in education, training, and access to effective treatments. These gaps contribute to inadequate obesity management and reinforce stigma and weight bias in healthcare settings. The Standards of Care in Overweight and Obesity-2025, developed by The Obesity Association TM, a division of the American Diabetes Association (R), (ADA's Obesity Association), will provide evidence-based recommendations for screening, diagnosis, and management of obesity and related complications. These guidelines will emphasize a complication-centric, risk-reduction approach rather than solely focusing on weight loss. The recommendations will be intended for healthcare professionals, including but not limited to primary care physicians, endocrinologists, obesity medicine physicians, dietitians, and behavioral health specialists, as well as policymakers and insurers. The guideline development will follow a rigorous methodology, incorporating evidence from systematic literature reviews, expert consensus, and public feedback. Recommendations will be graded based on the quality and certainity of supporting evidence, with the goal of annual updates to ensure alignment with the latest research. A stringent conflict-of-interest policy will be maintained to uphold guideline integrity. By promoting personalized and equitable obesity care, these guidelines will aim to bridge existing gaps in clinical practice, enhance treatment accessibility, and improve long-term health outcomes for individuals with overweight or obesity.

### Dynamics of obesity and chronic health conditions among children and youth [^ac3dabec]. JAMA (2010). Excellent credibility.

Context

Rates of obesity and other childhood chronic conditions have increased over recent decades. Patterns of how conditions change over time have not been widely examined.

Objective

To evaluate change in prevalence of obesity and other chronic conditions in US children, including incidence, remission, and prevalence.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Prospective study using the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth-Child Cohort (1988–2006) of 3 nationally representative cohorts of children. Children were aged 2 through 8 years at the beginning of each study period, and cohorts were followed up for 6 years, from 1988 to 1994 (cohort 1, n = 2337), 1994 to 2000 (cohort 2, n = 1759), and 2000 to 2006 (n = 905).

Main Outcome Measures

Parent report of a child having a health condition that limited activities or schooling or required medicine, special equipment, or specialized health services and that lasted at least 12 months. Obesity was defined as a body mass index at or above the 95th percentile for age. Chronic conditions were grouped into 4 categories: obesity, asthma, other physical conditions, and behavior/learning problems.

Results

The end-study prevalence of any chronic health condition was 12.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] 11.2%-14.5%) for cohort 1 in 1994, 25.1% (95% CI, 22.7%-27.6%) for cohort 2 in 2000, and 26.6% (95% CI, 23.5%-29.9%) for cohort 3 in 2006. There was substantial turnover in chronic conditions: 7.4% (95% CI, 6.5%-8.3%) of participants in all cohorts had a chronic condition at the beginning of the study that persisted to the end, 9.3% (95% CI, 8.3%-10.3%) reported conditions at the beginning that resolved within 6 years, and 13.4% (95% CI, 12.3%-14.6%) had new conditions that arose during the 6-year study period. The prevalence of having a chronic condition during any part of the 6-year study period was highest for cohort 3 (51.5%; 95% CI, 47.3%-55.0%), and there were higher rates among male (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 1.24; 95% CI, 1.07–1.42), Hispanic (AOR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.11–1.67), and black (AOR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.35–1.90) youth.

Conclusions

Prevalence of chronic conditions among children and youth increased from 1988 to 2006. However, presence of these conditions was dynamic over each 6-year cohort.

### Long term follow up of high risk children: who, why and how? [^aa8ea403]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Physical health

Physical health can include a number of different areas, as follows:
i. General health Regardless of the age of the child, any current or ongoing health problems must always be addressed, particularly because they could affect performance in other areas of the child's development. Some of these health problems could result from complications arising in the newborn period, such as ongoing breathing difficulties and oxygen dependency from lung injury.
ii. Growth Height, weight and head circumference will be relevant at all ages, but particularly in early life when growth rates are high and when aberrations of growth, particularly poor growth, detected by plotting the measurements on growth charts relevant for the age and sex of the child, can be indicators of underlying health problems. After the first few years growth in all measurements slows, apart from during puberty, and poor growth is less likely to present as a new problem. Overweight and obesity, on the other hand, are ongoing health problems throughout life, and are increasingly common in recent years in both childhood and adulthood in Australia and elsewhere. Other measurements, such as mid-arm circumference or skin-fold thickness might be relevant for some research questions, but are not usually helpful in clinical practice. The waist-to-hip ratio currently is valuable for emphasising life course cardiovascular preventative health.
iii. Feeding problems

### Consequences of obesity | Overweight&obesity… [^eee05fcb]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Health Conditions Obesity in children and adults increases the risk for the following health conditions. 1, 2, 3
- High blood pressure and high cholesterol which are risk factors for heart disease.
- Type 2 diabetes.
- Breathing problems, such as asthma and sleep apnea.
- Joint problems such as osteoarthritis and musculoskeletal discomfort.
- Gallstones and gallbladder disease. Childhood obesity is also associated with: 4, 5, 6
- Psychological problems such as anxiety and depression.
- Low self-esteem and lower self-reported quality of life.
- Social problems such as bullying and stigma.
- Obesity as adults. Adults with obesity have higher risks for stroke, many types of cancer, premature death, and mental illness such as clinical depression and anxiety. 7, 8. Economic Impact Annual obesity-related medical care costs in the United States, in 2019 dollars, were estimated to be nearly $173 billion. 9 Annual nationwide productivity costs of obesity-related absenteeism range between $3.

38 billion and $6. 38 billion. 10 Direct medical costs may include preventive, diagnostic, and treatment services. Indirect costs relate to sickness and death and include lost productivity. Productivity measures include employees being absent from work for obesity-related health reasons, decreased productivity while at work, and premature death and disability 11. Military Readiness Just over 1 in 3 young adults aged 17–24 is too heavy to serve in the US military. Among the young adults who meet weight requirements, only 3 in 4 report physical activity levels that prepare them for challenges in basic training. Consequently, only 2 in 5 young adults are both weight-eligible and adequately active for military service.

### Prevention and treatment of pediatric obesity: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline based on expert opinion [^179b43a9]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2008). Low credibility.

1.0 The problem with obesity

The objective of interventions in overweight and obese patients is the prevention or amelioration of obesity-related comorbidities, e.g. glucose intolerance and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), metabolic syndrome, dyslipidemia, and hypertension.

The prevalence of obesity (BMI in the 95th percentile or above) increased almost 4-fold for 6- to 11-yr-old children and 3-fold for 12 to 19 yr olds between the surveys of 1963–1970 and 1999–2000. For infants (0–23 months), the increase was from 7.2% in 1976–1980 to 11.6%; for 2 to 5 yr olds, the increase was from 5 to 13.9% during this time. Although rates vary among different ethnic groups, the overall prevalence of childhood obesity is 17.1%. The standards for weight and BMI percentiles are derived from the data of National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) II (1976–1980) and National Health Examination Survey (NHES) I (1963–1965) and II (1966–1970), when children were leaner.

The prevalence of overweight (BMI ≥ 85th but < 95th percentile) in the same period increased by 2.5-fold to 37.2% in boys and girls older than 6 yr of age. Exact rates vary according to ethnicity.

The prevalence of pediatric obesity varies according to ethnicity, with especially high rates among Mexican-Americans and African-Americans. The role of poverty, although tending to be associated with a higher prevalence of obesity, is inconsistent across ethnicity and gender.

1.1 Association with adult disease

This increased prevalence is particularly important because childhood overweight and obesity are predictive of adult overweight and obesity. After adjusting for parental obesity, the odds ratio for a BMI > 27.8 kg/m² for men and > 27.3 kg/m² for women aged 21–29 yr increased from 1.3 when children aged 1–2 yr had a BMI > the 85th percentile to an odds ratio of 17.5 when children aged 15–17 yr had a BMI > the 85th percentile. The results are similar when looking at overweight adults at age 35 yr compared with childhood BMIs at the 75th, 85th, and 95th percentiles. A BMI in the 85th percentile or above during the preschool and elementary school years is associated with a significantly increased risk of overweight in adolescents.

### Early childhood health promotion and its life course health consequences [^044794bc]. Academic Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To explore whether health promotion efforts targeted at preschool-age children can improve health across the life span and improve future economic returns to society.

Methods

We selected 4 health topics to review-tobacco exposure, unintentional injury, obesity, and mental health-because they are clinically and epidemiologically significant, and represent the complex nature of health problems in this early period of life. The peer-reviewed literature was searched to assess the level of evidence for short- and long-term health impacts of health promotion and disease prevention interventions for children from before birth to age 5. This review sought to document the monetary burden of poor child health, the cost implications of preventing and treating child health problems, and the net benefit of the interventions.

Results

The evidence is compelling that these 4 topics-tobacco exposure, unintentional injury, obesity, and mental health-constitute a significant burden on the health of children and are the early antecedents of significant health problems across the life span. The evidence for the cost consequences of these problems is strong, although more uneven than the epidemiological data. The available evidence for the effectiveness of interventions in this age group was strongest in the case of preventing tobacco exposure and injuries, was limited to smaller-scale clinical interventions in the case of mental health, and was least available for efforts to prevent obesity among preschoolers.

Conclusions

Currently available research justifies the implementation of health interventions in the prenatal to preschool period-especially to reduce tobacco exposure and prevent injuries. There is an urgent need for carefully targeted, rigorous research to examine the longitudinal causal relationships and provide stronger economic data to help policy makers make the case that the entire society will benefit from wise investment in improving the health of preschool-age children and their families.

The growing number of obese children and adolescents across the world creates a diagnostic challenge to caregivers. The early clinical manifestations of abnormalities related to childhood obesity, attributed to obesity-driven insulin resistance, are impaired glucose metabolism and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Both have no symptoms and demand a high index of suspicion and the proper choice of tests for establishing the diagnosis. The clinician should gather information derived from thoroughly taken history and a focused physical examination to stratify patients by their risk. Focused lifestyle modification-aimed interventions are showing promising results in improving the metabolic profile of obese children. Early diagnosis may help allocate resources for intensive interventions that may benefit individuals at greatest risk for early obesity-related morbidity.

### Pediatric obesity-long-term consequences and effect of weight loss [^1075f072]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Childhood obesity is, according to the WHO, one of the most serious challenges of the 21st century. More than 100 million children have obesity today. Already during childhood, almost all organs are at risk of being affected by obesity. In this review, we present the current knowledge about diseases associated with childhood obesity and how they are affected by weight loss. One major causative factor is obesity‐induced low‐grade chronic inflammation, which can be observed already in preschool children. This inflammation — together with endocrine, paracrine, and metabolic effects of obesity — increases the long‐term risk for several severe diseases. Type 2 diabetes is increasingly prevalent in adolescents and young adults who have had obesity during childhood. When it is diagnosed in young individuals, the morbidity and mortality rate is higher than when it occurs later in life, and more dangerous than type 1 diabetes. Childhood obesity also increases the risk for several autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis, Crohn's disease, arthritis, and type 1 diabetes and it is well established that childhood obesity also increases the risk for cardiovascular disease. Consequently, childhood obesity increases the risk for premature mortality, and the mortality rate is three times higher already before 30 years of age compared with the normal population. The risks associated with childhood obesity are modified by weight loss. However, the risk reduction is affected by the age at which weight loss occurs. In general, early weight loss — that is, before puberty — is more beneficial, but there are marked disease‐specific differences.

### Screening for obesity in children and adolescents: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^098520c7]. JAMA (2017). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Based on year 2000 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention growth charts, approximately 17% of children and adolescents aged 2 to 19 years in the United States have obesity, and almost 32% of children and adolescents are overweight or have obesity. Obesity in children and adolescents is associated with morbidity such as mental health and psychological issues, asthma, obstructive sleep apnea, orthopedic problems, and adverse cardiovascular and metabolic outcomes (eg, high blood pressure, abnormal lipid levels, and insulin resistance). Children and adolescents may also experience teasing and bullying behaviors based on their weight. Obesity in childhood and adolescence may continue into adulthood and lead to adverse cardiovascular outcomes or other obesity-related morbidity, such as type 2 diabetes.

Subpopulation Considerations

Although the overall rate of child and adolescent obesity has stabilized over the last decade after increasing steadily for 3 decades, obesity rates continue to increase in certain populations, such as African American girls and Hispanic boys. These racial/ethnic differences in obesity prevalence are likely a result of both genetic and nongenetic factors (eg, socioeconomic status, intake of sugar-sweetened beverages and fast food, and having a television in the bedroom).

Objective

To update the 2010 US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation on screening for obesity in children 6 years and older.

Evidence Review

The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on screening for obesity in children and adolescents and the benefits and harms of weight management interventions.

Findings

Comprehensive, intensive behavioral interventions (≥ 26 contact hours) in children and adolescents 6 years and older who have obesity can result in improvements in weight status for up to 12 months; there is inadequate evidence regarding the effectiveness of less intensive interventions. The harms of behavioral interventions can be bounded as small to none, and the harms of screening are minimal. Therefore, the USPSTF concluded with moderate certainty that screening for obesity in children and adolescents 6 years and older is of moderate net benefit.

Conclusions and Recommendation

The USPSTF recommends that clinicians screen for obesity in children and adolescents 6 years and older and offer or refer them to comprehensive, intensive behavioral interventions to promote improvements in weight status. (B recommendation).

### Preventing childhood obesity: 6 things families can Do… [^6afa715b]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Why it matters About 1 in 5 American children have obesity. Compared to children with healthy weight, children with obesity are at a higher risk for asthma, sleep apnea, bone and joint problems, type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, and mental health concerns like depression and anxiety. Children with obesity are more likely to have obesity as adults. Adults with obesity have higher risks for stroke, many types of cancer, heart disease, type 2 diabetes, premature death and mental health issues. Factors that influence obesity include genes, eating patterns, physical activity levels, access to health care, and sleep routines. Also, conditions where we live, learn, work, and play affect access to healthy food and safe places to be physically active. Though there is no one solution to addressing obesity, there are many ways parents and caregivers can help children have a healthy weight and set up lifelong healthy habits at home.

Help kids rethink their drink by replacing sugary drinks, such as soda, fruit drinks, and flavored milk, with water, 100% juice, or plain milk. Sugary drinks are the leading sources of added sugars in the American diet. Having too many sugary drinks can lead to weight gain, obesity, type 2 diabetes, and dental problems like cavities.
2. Move more as a family Physically active youth have stronger muscles and bones, better cardiovascular fitness, and lower body fat than those who are inactive. Regular physical activity can also help improve attention and memory and reduce the risk of depression. Children aged 3–5 years should be physically active throughout the day. Guidelines recommend that children aged 6–17 years get at least 60 minutes of physical activity every day., including naps. Children 6–12 years old need 9–12 hours of uninterrupted sleep a night, and youth 13–17 need 8–10 hours. Keeping a consistent sleep schedule, including on weekends, can help children sleep better.
4.

Replace screen time with family time During childhood, too much screen time can lead to poor sleep, weight gain, lower grades in school, and poor mental health. Reducing screen time can free up time for family activities and can remove cues to eat unhealthy food. When looking for ECE programs for your child, ask about policies and practices related to nutrition and physical activity, like breastfeeding and feeding breast milk to infants, nutrition standards for the food served, access to outdoor physical activity, and daily screen time.
6. Find a family healthy weight program.

### Obesity in American-Indian children: prevalence, consequences, and prevention [^6186965e]. Preventive Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Background

American Indians of all ages and both sexes have a high prevalence of obesity. The health risks associated with obesity are numerous and include Type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and respiratory problems. Obesity has become a major health problem in American Indians only in the past few generations and it is believed to be associated with the relative abundance of high-fat, high-calorie foods and the rapid change from active to sedentary lifestyles.

Methods

The authors reviewed selected literature on prevalence of obesity in American-Indian children, and health consequences of obesity.

Results

Obesity is now one of the most serious public health problems facing American-Indian children, and it has grave implications for the immediate and long-term health of American-Indian youth. Unless this pattern is reversed, American-Indian populations will be burdened by an increased incidence of chronic diseases. Intervention studies are urgently needed in American-Indian communities to develop and test effective strategies for obesity prevention and treatment.

Conclusions

To be effective, educational and environmental interventions must be developed with full participation of the American-Indian communities.

In 2023, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) published its first clinical practice guideline (CPG) for the treatment of obesity. The CPG is organized by key action statements (KAS) and consensus recommendations that address screening, diagnosis and evaluatin of children and adolescents with obesity, assessment of comorbidities and evidence-based treatment options. The evidence base for each KAS and recommendation is detailed alongside care recommendations. Alongisde the publication of the CPG, the AAP published many resources for pediatric clinicians to support implementation of these recommendations to daily practice.

Obesity has become an important public health problem worldwide that disproportionally affects the underserved. Obesity has been associated with many diseases and unfortunately has not spared the respiratory system. Specifically, the prevalence of common respiratory problems, such as asthma and obstructive sleep apnoea, is higher in obese children. Further, the treatment outcomes of these frequent conditions is also worse in obese children compared to lean controls.

### Treatment of pediatric overweight and obesity: position of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics based on an umbrella review of systematic reviews [^628b39cc]. Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (2022). High credibility.

United States pediatric obesity burden — pediatric overweight and obesity continues to be a significant problem in the United States, and prevalence of pediatric obesity in 2017–2018 was 19.3%, affecting 14.4 million children and adolescents. Prevalence is higher among children who are Hispanic and non-Hispanic Black, and in families with lower- and middle-incomes. Obesity is associated with significant short- and long-term health problems, including cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, depression, and other mental health issues. Pediatric obesity is associated with higher hospitalization costs when it is a primary or secondary diagnosis and directly increases lifetime medical costs compared with youth without overweight or obesity.

### Musculoskeletal pain in overweight and obese children [^43182816]. International Journal of Obesity (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Worldwide childhood obesity has increased by 50% in the past 30 years, with ∼43 million children under the age of five being reported as overweight. The WHO defines overweight and obesity as abnormal or excessive fat accumulation that may impair health. In Australia, obesity, as defined by WHO, continues to be a major public health problem with over 20% of school children being either overweight or obeseand children from low socioeconomic areas being 70% more likely to be either overweight or obese. Central obesity, as measured by waist circumference, is thought to be a more reliable indicator of health problems than total body mass for people with a body mass index (BMI) of less than 35. Studies into obesity tend to report indices such as BMI and waist circumference. However, a definition of obesity and its clinical diagnosis is often difficult and remains controversial, with waist circumference, BMI and skin folds being the more common non-invasive measurements used. A number of reports suggest that overweight and obese children have subsequently developed short- and long-term health problems that continue into adult life. In particular, psychological co-morbidities associated with being overweight or obese during childhood and adolescence are well documented. These health problems include social isolation, depression, loneliness and low self-esteem, and more recently depressive symptoms have been linked with cardiorespiratory fitness in obese adolescents. Obesity in children is a significant public health problem, and it has the potential to have an impact on a child's osteoarticular health, resulting in ongoing chronic pain.

Pediatric obesity treatment goals and intermediate outcomes — in already obese children, "the primary goal of obesity treatment is to improve weight-for-height disproportion through weight loss in older children or through weight maintenance during linear growth through adoption of a healthier lifestyle in younger children", and the evidence review reports "a significant decrease in CV risk factors with an improvement in weight and/or decrease in body fatness", including "decreases in systolic and diastolic BPs", "decreases in TC, LDL–C, and/or TG", "decrease in IR", "decrease in inflammatory markers", and "improvement in subclinical measures of atherosclerosis". If weight improvements are sustained, "the improved weight profile should be associated with improved overall health and CV risk, reduced incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and other problems known to be associated with obesity in childhood".

### BMI is a poor predictor of adiposity in young overweight and obese children [^9db454ae]. BMC Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Childhood obesity is a global public health crisis and obesity in the United States has more than doubled in children and quadrupled in adolescents over the last 30 years. At present, more than one-third of children and adolescents in the United States are overweight or obese, more than 17% of these youth are obese. Childhood obesity is associated with cardiovascular disease, hypertension, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, asthma, obstructive sleep apnea, psychosocial problems, decreased quality of life, and increased likelihood of becoming obese adults. Morbidity and mortality risk may vary between different racial and Hispanic origin groups at the same body mass index (BMI). Adiposity is an independent risk factor for insulin resistance and a strong predictor of morbidity. Therefore, directly assessing body fat is a key strategy for preventative and therapeutic intervention of childhood obesity.

Obesity, or having excess body fat, can be defined using cut points of BMI; the ratio of an individual's weight to height squared (kg/m²). The BMI varies with age in children and thus BMI values are compared with age- and sex-specific references. For children and adolescents aged 2 to 19 years, BMI is plotted on the sex-specific, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) growth chart to identify the BMI-for-age percentile. Childhood obesity is defined as a BMI at or above the 95th percentile on the BMI-for-Age growth chart The BMI-for-age percentile is calculated based on a reference population. The indirect relationship between BMI and measures of adiposity has been established but varies according to sex, age, and race-ethnicity.

### Diet, physical activity and behavioural interventions for the treatment of overweight or obese children from the age of 6 to 11 years [^471b79bc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Child and adolescent overweight and obesity has increased globally, and can be associated with significant short- and long-term health consequences. This is an update of a Cochrane review published first in 2003, and updated previously in 2009. However, the update has now been split into six reviews addressing different childhood obesity treatments at different ages.

Objectives

To assess the effects of diet, physical activity and behavioural interventions (behaviour-changing interventions) for the treatment of overweight or obese children aged 6 to 11 years.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS as well as trial registers ClinicalTrials.gov and ICTRP Search Portal. We checked references of studies and systematic reviews. We did not apply any language restrictions. The date of the last search was July 2016 for all databases.

Selection Criteria

We selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of diet, physical activity, and behavioural interventions (behaviour-changing interventions) for treating overweight or obese children aged 6 to 11 years, with a minimum of six months' follow-up. We excluded interventions that specifically dealt with the treatment of eating disorders or type 2 diabetes, or included participants with a secondary or syndromic cause of obesity.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened references, extracted data, assessed risk of bias, and evaluated the quality of the evidence using the GRADE instrument. We contacted study authors for additional information. We carried out meta-analyses according to the statistical guidelines in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions.

Main Results

We included 70 RCTs with a total of 8461 participants randomised to either the intervention or control groups. The number of participants per trial ranged from 16 to 686. Fifty-five trials compared a behaviour-changing intervention with no treatment/usual care control and 15 evaluated the effectiveness of adding an additional component to a behaviour-changing intervention. Sixty-four trials were parallel RCTs, and four were cluster RCTs. Sixty-four trials were multicomponent, two were diet only and four were physical activity only interventions. Ten trials had more than two arms. The overall quality of the evidence was low or very low and 62 trials had a high risk of bias for at least one criterion. Total duration of trials ranged from six months to three years. The median age of participants was 10 years old and the median BMI z score was 2.2. Primary analyses demonstrated that behaviour-changing interventions compared to no treatment/usual care control at longest follow-up reduced BMI, BMI z score and weight. Mean difference (MD) in BMI was -0.53 kg/m² (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.82 to -0.24); P < 0.00001; 24 trials; 2785 participants; low-quality evidence. MD in BMI z score was -0.06 units (95% CI -0.10 to -0.02); P = 0.001; 37 trials; 4019 participants; low-quality evidence and MD in weight was -1.45 kg (95% CI -1.88 to -1.02); P < 0.00001; 17 trials; 1774 participants; low-quality evidence. Thirty-one trials reported on serious adverse events, with 29 trials reporting zero occurrences RR 0.57 (95% CI 0.17 to 1.93); P = 0.37; 4/2105 participants in the behaviour-changing intervention groups compared with 7/1991 participants in the comparator groups). Few trials reported health-related quality of life or behaviour change outcomes, and none of the analyses demonstrated a substantial difference in these outcomes between intervention and control. In two trials reporting on minutes per day of TV viewing, a small reduction of 6.6 minutes per day (95% CI -12.88 to -0.31), P = 0.04; 2 trials; 55 participants) was found in favour of the intervention. No trials reported on all-cause mortality, morbidity or socioeconomic effects, and few trials reported on participant views; none of which could be meta-analysed. As the meta-analyses revealed substantial heterogeneity, we conducted subgroup analyses to examine the impact of type of comparator, type of intervention, risk of attrition bias, setting, duration of post-intervention follow-up period, parental involvement and baseline BMI z score. No subgroup effects were shown for any of the subgroups on any of the outcomes. Some data indicated that a reduction in BMI immediately post-intervention was no longer evident at follow-up at less than six months, which has to be investigated in further trials.

Authors' Conclusions

Multi-component behaviour-changing interventions that incorporate diet, physical activity and behaviour change may be beneficial in achieving small, short-term reductions in BMI, BMI z score and weight in children aged 6 to 11 years. The evidence suggests a very low occurrence of adverse events. The quality of the evidence was low or very low. The heterogeneity observed across all outcomes was not explained by subgrouping. Further research is required of behaviour-changing interventions in lower income countries and in children from different ethnic groups; also on the impact of behaviour-changing interventions on health-related quality of life and comorbidities. The sustainability of reduction in BMI/BMI z score and weight is a key consideration and there is a need for longer-term follow-up and further research on the most appropriate forms of post-intervention maintenance in order to ensure intervention benefits are sustained over the longer term.

### Prevention and treatment of pediatric obesity: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline based on expert opinion [^ec9350d6]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2008). Low credibility.

SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS

1.0 The problem with obesity

The objective of interventions in overweight and obese children and adolescents is the prevention or amelioration of obesity-related comorbidities, e.g. glucose intolerance and T2DM, metabolic syndrome, dyslipidemia, and hypertension.

2.0 Diagnosis of overweight and obesity

2.1 We recommend the use of the BMI (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared), with CDC-derived normative percentiles, as the preferred method for the diagnosis of the overweight or obese child (1 ⊕⊕○○).

2.2 We recommend that a child be diagnosed as overweight if the BMI is in at least the 85th percentile but < the 95th percentile for age and sex, and as obese if the BMI is in at least the 95th percentile for age and sex (1 ⊕○○○).

2.3 We recommend against a routine laboratory evaluation for endocrine causes of obesity in obese children or early to midpubertal obese adolescents unless the child's height velocity, assessed in relation to stage of puberty and family background, is attenuated (1 ⊕⊕○○).

2.4.a We recommend referral to a geneticist for children whose obesity has a syndromic etiology, especially in the presence of neurodevelopmental abnormalities (1 ⊕○○○).

2.4.b We suggest that parents of children who have inexorably gained weight from early infancy and have risen above the 97th percentile for weight by 3 yr of age be informed of the availability of MC4R genetic testing. However, the test is positive in only 2–4% of such patients who are above the 97th percentile for weight and currently will not alter treatment (2 ⊕○○○).

2.5 We recommend that children with a BMI in at least the 85th percentile be evaluated for associated comorbidities and complications (see Table 1 and Fig. 1) (1 ⊕○○○).

3.0 Treatment of obesity

3.1 Lifestyle recommendations

3.1.0 We recommend that clinicians prescribe and support intensive lifestyle (dietary, physical activity, and behavioral) modification for the entire family and the patient in an age-appropriate manner and as the prerequisite for all overweight and obesity treatments for children and adolescents (1 ⊕○○○).

2.1 Remarks

Although not ideal, the BMI is the internationally recognized standard for the definition of overweight and obesity, and the CDC standard curves are the most readily available standards for American children. The Task Force elected not to recommend another standard without higher quality evidence.

Stunted populations may have an increased BMI without increased body fat. Taller individuals may have a high BMI even if their body proportions are equivalent to those of shorter individuals. In individuals who are not unusually short or tall, a high BMI is likely to predict abnormally high body fat content. However, a normal BMI does not always exclude the presence of increased body fat or increased risk of obesity-associated comorbidities (see 2.2 Remarks). Fat tissue and BMI increase naturally with pubertal progression in girls, so that matching the value to chronological age may be misleading if the child progresses through puberty outside the average age range.

Much research has focused on using the waist circumference or waist-to-height ratio as a marker of obesity, as well as an additional marker for IR (,–). This approach has the advantage of taking into account body fat distribution and the greater cardiovascular risk associated with visceral fat. Waist circumference standards for American children of various ethnic groups are available. Waist circumference should be recorded because future research may prove this measure to reflect fatness or morbidity better.

BMI (weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) is plotted according to the standardized CDC growth charts for the United States. Waist circumference is measured at the level of the iliac crest and interpreted according to age, sex, and racial standards.

2.2 Recommendation

We recommend that a child be diagnosed as overweight if the BMI is at least in the 85th percentile but < the 95th percentile and obese if the BMI is at least in the 95th percentile for age and sex (1 ⊕○○○).

2.2 Evidence

Adults experience increased morbidity and mortality when the BMI rises over 30 kg/m², which is about the 95th percentile of BMI at 19½ yr of age. Clinicians caring for children can use curves generated by tracing the progression of BMI values for age back from the various percentiles at this older age to determine, in an age-adjusted manner, what BMI is equivalent to 25 or 30 kg/m² for an adult. Although these cutoffs are not derived from pediatric data, some experts consider them to be relevant indicators of health and morbidity, but others do not.

### Healthy for now? A cross-sectional study of the comorbidities in obese preschool children in the United States [^7395b33f]. Clinical Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

Examine health of preschoolers by BMI status.

Methods

A cross-sectional analysis of children 3 to 5 years old in the 1999–2008 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey was carried out. The measured age- and sex-specific BMI percentiles were used to categorize children as very obese, obese, overweight, or healthy weight. The authors used logistic regression to examine the effect of weight status on 17 available measures of current child health potentially related to obesity.

Results

Except for very obese children, weight status had minimal effect on most measures of health for preschool-aged children (n = 2792). Parents of very obese children reported poorer general health and more activity limitations for their children. Additionally, very obese girls had more frequent/severe headaches, and overweight/obese boys had more asthma diagnoses.

Conclusions

Only severe obesity appears consistently related to immediate health problems in preschool-aged children. Parental perception that very obese children have worse health and more activity limitations may lead to decreases in physical activity, which would perpetuate obesity.

### Global prevalence of overweight and obesity in children and adolescents: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^fcbd2ad4]. JAMA Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, the current study provided new epidemiological insights of overweight and obesity among children and adolescents worldwide. Our findings indicated high prevalence of overweight and obesity in children and adolescent with a pooled estimation of 8.5% and 14.8%, meaning approximately 1 of every 5 children or adolescents experience excess weight. Various risk factors, including inherent, dietary, and environmental factors, were significantly associated with the prevalence of pediatric obesity. It is noteworthy that children and adolescents with obesity were at high risk of mental and physical comorbidities. Global coordinated action and national control program are paramount to comprehend, prevent, and manage childr and adolescent obesity.

### Effect of pediatric obesity treatment on long-term health [^96dd0800]. JAMA Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Childhood obesity has reached epidemic proportions in both developed and developing countries. By 2035, the global prevalence of obesity in individuals aged 5 to 19 years is estimated to be 18% among girls and 20% among boys. Childhood obesity is associated with hypertension, steatotic liver disease, insulin resistance, and psychosocial issues, such as anxiety, depression, and stigma. Additionally, children and adolescents with obesity are at a greater risk of ill health in adulthood compared with those of a healthy weight.,

Beneficial response to behavioral lifestyle obesity treatments in children and adolescents improves short- and long-term health. In adolescents, both bariatric surgery and pharmacotherapy have been shown to reduce the degree of obesity when lifestyle intervention alone proves insufficient. However, the extent of weight loss necessary to mitigate, or even eliminate, long-term obesity-related outcomes remains to be determined.

Evidence-based treatment options for childhood obesity have been available in Sweden for more than 15 years, with the main option being behavioral lifestyle modification. Multiple studies, have used the Swedish Childhood Obesity Treatment Register (BORIS)to assess the link between obesity and related complications in children. BORIS is the world's second largest prospective register of children and adolescents receiving treatment for obesity. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of pediatric obesity treatment response on obesity-related outcomes and mortality in young adulthood.

### Recorded diagnosis of overweight / obesity in primary care is linked to obesity care performance rates [^3df20986]. Pediatric Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Obesity is a global public health challenge with worldwide increased incidence. Childhood obesity has reached pandemic proportions and is currently one of the most prevalent public health problems. The pathophysiology of excess weight gain is complex, and includes interactions between genetic, biological, behavioral (physical inactivity, increased screen time), and socioeconomic factors. –

The increasing prevalence of childhood obesity is associated with the emergence of comorbidities previously considered to be "adult" diseases, including hypertension, dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The negative health, social, and economic consequences of obesity can impact a child's quality of life. Moreover, children with obesity are likely to become adults with obesity; the latter confers increased risks of morbidity and mortality. Therefore, controlling the childhood obesity pandemic has become a top public health priority worldwide.

In clinical practice, body mass index (BMI) frequently serves as both a screening and diagnostic tool for detecting excess body adiposity, because it is easy to use and inexpensive. For children and teens, BMI interpretation is age- and sex-specific, and a child's BMI category is determined using an age-and sex-specific percentile for BMI. The World Health Organization (WHO) has defined age-specific cutoff values of BMI for pediatric overweight and obesity.

Periodical BMI measurement during regular visits with primary care pediatricians (PCP) is central to diagnosing overweight and obesity, and to managing and tracking overweight and obesity in children and adolescents.

Early and accurate classifications of overweight and obesity, and identifying obesity-related comorbidities are fundamental to providing appropriate treatment. This is important because young patients and their parents often do not perceive overweight and obesity as health problems; and may thus not benefit from health behavior and lifestyle change treatment, or pharmacological anti-obesity medication treatment.

### Management of the pediatric patient with asthma and obesity [^6351a0c1]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2024). Medium credibility.

Asthma and obesity are 2 of the most significant chronic diseases of childhood. Both are major public health problems that have been increasing in prevalence. Obesity increases the risk of developing asthma in children, and in children with asthma, obesity increases asthma severity and morbidity. The nature of this relationship is complex and not fully understood, but some pediatric patients with "obesity-related asthma" may represent a phenotype that differs from the more classical, atopic pediatric asthma. In this review, we investigate and discuss some of the currently available literature regarding treatment for asthma complicated by obesity in the pediatric population. We cover the importance of healthy lifestyle modifications, management of obesity-related comorbidities, and the potential role of nutritional supplementation or modification. We then review recent literature, mostly in adults, investigating the potential role of obesity or diabetes medications in the management of patients with asthma who have obesity. Finally, we discuss some of the necessary next steps before these potential new treatments can be considered as part of the standard clinical management of asthma.

### Childhood obesity [^58ee5683]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2005). Low credibility.

In March 2004 a group of 65 physicians and other health professionals representing nine countries on four continents convened in Israel to discuss the widespread public health crisis in childhood obesity. Their aim was to explore the available evidence and develop a consensus on the way forward. The process was rigorous, although time and resources did not permit the development of formal evidence-based guidelines. In the months before meeting, participants were allocated to seven groups covering prevalence, causes, risks, prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and psychology. Through electronic communication each group selected the key issues for their area, searched the literature, and developed a draft document. Over the 3-d meeting, these papers were debated and finalized by each group before presenting to the full group for further discussion and agreement. In developing a consensus statement, this international group has presented the evidence, developed recommendations, and provided a platform aimed toward future corrective action and ongoing debate in the international community.

### Metabolic, behavioral health, and disordered eating comorbidities associated with obesity in pediatric patients: an obesity medical association (OMA) clinical practice statement 2022 [^3549c596]. Obesity Pillars (2022). High credibility.

Pediatric obesity — depression comorbidity, risk factors, and management are summarized as follows: Depression frequently co-exists with obesity in children, and more severe depression is associated with higher BMI weight categories and is more likely in females than males; the onset of depression and/or obesity is bidirectional, and the combination of obesity and depression increases the risk of cardiovascular disease 5-fold. Influences that can raise the risk of obesity and depression include use of social media associated with an increase in body dissatisfaction, peer victimization, bullying and teasing related to weight, and co-existing eating disorders. The diagnosis of depression is made by a mental health professional through structured interviews and validated depression scales, and health risk screening for depression in adolescents, which helps identify those at risk, is recommended in children and adolescents. Management of depression includes consideration of pharmacotherapy, often antidepressants, and antidepressant usage is independently associated with increasing BMI trajectory over time; initial improvement in depression can occur post weight loss from metabolic and bariatric surgery, but symptoms may return with weight regain. Whatever obesity treatment regimen is employed, mental health support is key in addressing preexisting mental health issues along with support for weight loss/regain adjustment concerns.

### Long-term effects of adolescent obesity: time to act [^272a9cca]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2018). Medium credibility.

Obesity in adolescence will probably have major implications not only for the affected adolescents but also for society. Those who have obesity during adolescence usually have obesity into adulthood, which causes many medical and psychological issues that can result in premature death. Furthermore, obesity in adolescents is associated with a range of social problems, including difficulties securing an apprenticeship or a job or finding a partner. Adolescents with obesity are also at increased risk of having children with obesity later in life. All these consequences lead to high costs for the health-care system. Although efficient treatment options are available that have been proven in randomized controlled trials, such as lifestyle interventions for adolescents with obesity and bariatric surgery for adolescents with severe obesity, these interventions frequently fail in clinical practice as treatment adherence is low in adolescents and most adolescents with obesity do not seek medical care. Therefore, improving treatment adherence and identifying treatment barriers are necessary.

### Parent-only interventions for childhood overweight or obesity in children aged 5 to 11 years [^d830e265]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Child and adolescent overweight and obesity have increased globally, and are associated with short- and long-term health consequences.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy of diet, physical activity and behavioural interventions delivered to parents only for the treatment of overweight and obesity in children aged 5 to 11 years.

Search Methods

We performed a systematic literature search of databases including the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL and LILACS as well trial registers. We checked references of identified trials and systematic reviews. We applied no language restrictions. The date of the last search was March 2015 for all databases.

Selection Criteria

We selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of diet, physical activity and behavioural interventions delivered to parents only for treating overweight or obesity in children aged 5 to 11 years.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trials for risk of bias and evaluated overall study quality using the GRADE instrument. Where necessary, we contacted authors for additional information.

Main Results

We included 20 RCTs, including 3057 participants. The number of participants ranged per trial between 15 and 645. Follow-up ranged between 24 weeks and two years. Eighteen trials were parallel RCTs and two were cluster RCTs. Twelve RCTs had two comparisons and eight RCTs had three comparisons. The interventions varied widely; the duration, content, delivery and follow-up of the interventions were heterogeneous. The comparators also differed. This review categorised the comparisons into four groups: parent-only versus parent-child, parent-only versus waiting list controls, parent-only versus minimal contact interventions and parent-only versus other parent-only interventions. Trial quality was generally low with a large proportion of trials rated as high risk of bias on individual risk of bias criteria. In trials comparing a parent-only intervention with a parent-child intervention, the body mass index (BMI) z score change showed a mean difference (MD) at the longest follow-up period (10 to 24 months) of -0.04 (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.15 to 0.08); P = 0.56; 267 participants; 3 trials; low quality evidence. In trials comparing a parent-only intervention with a waiting list control, the BMI z score change in favour of the parent-only intervention at the longest follow-up period (10–12 months) had an MD of -0.10 (95% CI -0.19 to -0.01); P = 0.04; 136 participants; 2 trials; low quality evidence. BMI z score change of parent-only interventions when compared with minimal contact control interventions at the longest follow-up period (9 to 12 months) showed an MD of 0.01 (95% CI -0.07 to 0.09); P = 0.81; 165 participants; 1 trial; low quality evidence. There were few similarities between interventions and comparators across the included trials in the parent-only intervention versus other parent-only interventions and we did not pool these data. Generally, these trials did not show substantial differences between their respective parent-only groups on BMI outcomes. Other outcomes such as behavioural measures, parent-child relationships and health-related quality of life were reported inconsistently. Adverse effects of the interventions were generally not reported, two trials stated that there were no serious adverse effects. No trials reported on all-cause mortality, morbidity or socioeconomic effects. All results need to be interpreted cautiously because of their low quality, the heterogeneous interventions and comparators, and the high rates of non-completion.

Authors' Conclusions

Parent-only interventions may be an effective treatment option for overweight or obese children aged 5 to 11 years when compared with waiting list controls. Parent-only interventions had similar effects compared with parent-child interventions and compared with those with minimal contact controls. However, the evidence is at present limited; some of the trials had a high risk of bias with loss to follow-up being a particular issue and there was a lack of evidence for several important outcomes. The systematic review has identified 10 ongoing trials that have a parent-only arm, which will contribute to future updates. These trials will improve the robustness of the analyses by type of comparator, and may permit subgroup analysis by intervention component and the setting. Trial reports should provide adequate details about the interventions to be replicated by others. There is a need to conduct and report cost-effectiveness analyses in future trials in order to establish whether parent-only interventions are more cost-effective than parent-child interventions.

### Cardiovascular morbidity, diabetes and cancer risk among children and adolescents with severe obesity [^6969afe2]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The prevalence of childhood obesity has dramatically increased over the last decades. This has prompted the need for obesity stratification to identify those at increased cardiometabolic risk. Substantial data have accumulated on the association of childhood obesity with cardiometabolic risk, though obesity was usually considered as a single entity. Extreme values of body mass index (BMI), categorized as severe obesity, were once a phenomenon of adults. However, the problem is escalating in the pediatric population. According to a recent report, in many of 21 European countries, 1 in 4 children with obesity at school age have severe obesity. Furthermore, 2.1% of children between ages 2 to 5 years from the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) and 1.3% of Canadians of this age group; and 1.5% of toddlers (2–3 year-old) from the US National Institute (NIH) of Health Environmental Influences on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO) program and 0.3% of a cohort of Canadian children aged 17 to 24 months reportedly had severe obesity. Since severe obesity in childhood has become common only in the last decades, the relative contribution of this phenomenon to disease burden has only recently been approached. Identifying those with substantial risk for severe obesity and its deleterious cardiovascular sequelae is of great clinical and public health importance. This review aims to summarize (i) the association between severe obesity and the prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors, diabetes and cancer in cross-sectional studies; (ii) the relationship between severe obesity and incident cardiometabolic, cancer and mortality in longitudinal studies. We aimed to highlight gaps in evidence in order to direct future research.

1 INTRODUCTION

Child obesity has long been a worldwide public health concern. Child body mass index (BMI) has now plateaued in many high‐income countries, but it continues to rise elsewhere. The universally accepted definitions of overweight and obesity in adults are BMI 25+ and 30+ kg/m², respectively, and the changing prevalence of overweight and obesity across countries and regions over time has been widely documented, a recent study summarizing rates in 200 countries.BMI is also used to assess thinness, defined as BMI less than 18.5 kg/m².

The assessment of overweight, obesity and thinness in children is more complex than in adults. As a measure, BMI is equally valid, but because children grow in height and weight, child BMI needs adjusting for age and sex using a suitable reference. There are two widely used international child BMI references, the International Obesity Task Force (IOTF) cut‐offs, and the World Health Organization (WHO) growth standard and reference. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reference is also used, and all three are endorsed by the European Child Obesity Group (ECOG). The references convert BMI to an age–sex‐adjusted z ‐score, and the categories of overweight, obesity and thinness are defined as the child's z ‐score lying above (or for thinness, below) the relevant z ‐score cut‐off (see Table 1).

### Clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and treatment of children and adolescents with obesity [^c5786b2d]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

AAP childhood obesity guideline — evidence gaps and scope — highlights that current research provides insufficient information on heterogeneity of treatment effects and that many studies use restrictive inclusion criteria excluding children with comorbidities, disabilities, physical activity limitations, or medication use. It notes limited reporting of intervention dose, duration, and specific components; that comorbidity studies are mostly cross-sectional, limiting guidance on the appropriate age to begin laboratory evaluation; that epidemiologic and longitudinal studies are needed to identify age and BMI ranges and to guide monitoring and reevaluation frequency; and that consistent laboratory thresholds are needed. Few primary care studies evaluate outcomes other than BMI, evidence is lacking on whether comorbidity assessment or diagnosis affects engagement, the role of SDoHs and culture is limited, and harms are seldom assessed despite behavioral interventions generally carrying low risk. The evidence review did not include primary prevention or assessment and treatment of children 0 to 2 years of age, and early prevention is emphasized because 1 in 7 preschool-aged children already have obesity.

### Reducing risk of childhood obesity in the wake of COVID-19 [^dff4a823]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

The swift and necessary public health response to the covid-19 pandemic has had detrimental consequences for the prevention and management of childhood obesity, a concern critically in need of public health action. Although children are not as severely affected by covid-19 as adults — experiencing fewer or no symptoms — the public health response to mitigate its spread has exacerbated several risk factors for childhood obesity. Extended lockdowns and social distancing measures have increased children's exposure to obesogenic environments and disrupted their participation in health promoting behaviours.

Childhood obesity affects an estimated 50 million girls and 74 million boys worldwide. These children are at greater risk of developing related functional, metabolic, and psychological conditions; experiencing pervasive weight bias and stigma; and having greater healthcare costs. Childhood obesity is strongly correlated with risk of adult obesity and poor health, with considerable social and economic consequences. Despite efforts, no country is on track to meet the targets set out by the World Health Organization's Commission on Ending Childhood Obesity (ECHO).

All children have a right to healthcare, yet the evidence is clear that current obesogenic environments are detrimental to health, violating the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, to which many countries are signatories. Furthermore, childhood obesity is greater among poorer children, and trends continue to rise among marginalised and deprived populations, and those in low and middle income countries. The impact of covid-19 might exacerbate these inequities, with data from the United States indicating widening racial, ethnic, and neighbourhood socioeconomic differences in childhood obesity rates since its onset.

As we look towards recovery from covid-19, we have the chance to build back better, with the opportunity for increased focus on the role of public health and prevention to protect and promote the health of populations. With the public health response to covid-19 exacerbating risk factors for childhood obesity, there is an increased urgency for evidence based action.
