## Question

30y male with sever hematemesis, hypotensive, Hgb 9, endoscopy show 2×2 ulcer. what is the management?
- Stop the bleeding + highly Selective truncal vagotomy
- Stop the bleeding + post op PPI
- Stop the bleeding + Truncal vagotomy + Pylorplasty

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which management option is most appropriate for a 30-year-old male with severe hematemesis, hypotension, hemoglobin 9 g/dL, and a 2×2 cm peptic ulcer on endoscopy, and to choose among stopping the bleeding plus highly selective truncal vagotomy, stopping the bleeding plus postoperative PPI, or stopping the bleeding plus truncal vagotomy with pylorplasty. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate hemodynamic stabilization and transfusion thresholds. Then, I should verify the role and timing of endoscopic hemostasis. Next, I will review post-endoscopic acid suppression and H. pylori management. After that, I need to evaluate indications for surgery versus interventional radiology if endoscopy fails. Finally, I will consider the specific surgical options and decide which option best aligns with contemporary evidence-based care, including why older operations like truncal vagotomy are no longer first-line therapy.

> Let me first confirm the clinical scenario and risk profile. Severe hematemesis with hypotension and a 2×2 cm ulcer places this patient in a high-risk category for rebleeding and complications, warranting aggressive resuscitation and early definitive hemostasis; I should double-check that the hemoglobin of 9 g/dL in an unstable patient supports transfusion above a restrictive threshold, which it does in the setting of massive bleeding and hemodynamic instability [^112QFf8u].

> I need to ensure immediate priorities are addressed. Airway protection comes first if there is ongoing hematemesis or altered mental status, followed by rapid IV access and crystalloid resuscitation to restore perfusion, and then red cell transfusion to a hemoglobin target of about 7–9 g/dL in most patients, with a higher target around 9 g/dL in massive bleeding or significant comorbidity; I should confirm that these thresholds are consistent with major guidelines, which they are [^112WxE8t] [^112WxE8t].

> Next, I should review endoscopic therapy. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — endoscopy is the cornerstone, but timing matters. Early endoscopy within 24 hours is recommended for all UGIB, and in high-risk presentations with hemodynamic instability, endoscopy within 12–24 hours after stabilization is reasonable; I should confirm that combination endoscopic therapy (epinephrine injection plus a second modality such as thermal or mechanical therapy) is superior to monotherapy, which it is, and that epinephrine alone should not be used as monotherapy [^111rjcAj] [^112WxE8t] [^113P2PSS].

> Now, post-endoscopic management. I should confirm that high-dose IV PPI is indicated after successful endoscopic hemostasis in high-risk stigmata; yes, guidelines recommend an 80 mg IV bolus followed by 8 mg/hour continuous infusion for 72 hours, then step-down to twice-daily oral PPI for 14 days, and finally once-daily PPI to complete ulcer healing, which reduces rebleeding risk [^111rjcAj] [^1139J3py] [^1112pdab].

> But wait, what if endoscopic therapy fails or is not feasible? I need to check escalation pathways. If bleeding recurs or persists after a second attempt at endoscopic hemostasis, transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) is generally preferred over immediate surgery due to lower complication rates and similar mortality; surgery is reserved for failed TAE or when TAE is unavailable, with damage-control strategies considered in unstable patients [^111rjcAj] [^115BFPJM] [^117SS96m].

> Let me consider the surgical options now. Truncal vagotomy with pyloroplasty was historically used for refractory peptic ulcer disease, but hold on, I should verify current indications. Contemporary guidelines and surgical literature indicate that elective acid-reducing operations have largely been supplanted by effective medical therapy and endoscopic hemostasis; surgery today is typically for failed endoscopic/TAE control, and when surgery is needed, procedures are tailored to ulcer location and bleeding vessel control rather than routine vagotomy, which adds morbidity without proven benefit in the modern era [^116cT4LV].

> Hmm, wait a minute — what about "highly selective truncal vagotomy"? I should double-check the terminology. That phrase is imprecise; "highly selective vagotomy" (parietal cell vagotomy) and "truncal vagotomy" are distinct operations, and neither is first-line today for bleeding control. Given the availability of effective endoscopic therapy and PPI-based acid suppression, routine vagotomy is not indicated; surgery, if needed, should focus on hemostasis and ulcer management rather than acid-reducing vagotomy procedures.

> I will now examine the provided choices against evidence-based care. Option A proposes stopping the bleeding plus highly selective truncal vagotomy — this mixes terms and introduces an unnecessary acid-reducing operation that does not address the immediate need for endoscopic hemostasis and PPI therapy. Option B proposes stopping the bleeding plus postoperative PPI — this aligns with standard care if "stopping the bleeding" refers to endoscopic hemostasis followed by high-dose IV PPI. Option C proposes stopping the bleeding plus truncal vagotomy with pyloroplasty — again, this adds an outdated acid-reducing operation that is not indicated acutely when endoscopic therapy and PPI are effective [^111rjcAj] [^1112pdab] [^113WkJDZ].

> Let me reconsider and synthesize the optimal pathway. The best evidence-based sequence is aggressive resuscitation with transfusion to hemoglobin around 9 g/dL in this unstable presentation, urgent upper endoscopy with combination endoscopic hemostasis once the patient is stabilized, followed by 72 hours of high-dose IV PPI and then step-down oral PPI to complete ulcer healing, with H. pylori testing and eradication and careful review of NSAIDs/antithrombotics; surgery or TAE is reserved for failure of endoscopic therapy, not as initial therapy in a 30-year-old without contraindications to endoscopy [^1112pdab] [^111rjcAj] [^113P2PSS].

> Conclusion: Option B — "stop the bleeding + post-op PPI" — most closely matches contemporary guideline-based care, provided that "stop the bleeding" is interpreted as endoscopic hemostasis followed by guideline-directed high-dose PPI therapy; Options A and C inappropriately introduce truncal vagotomy, which is obsolete for initial management of bleeding peptic ulcer in the modern endoscopic and PPI era [^111rjcAj] [^1112pdab] [^113WkJDZ].

---

The correct answer is **stop the bleeding + post-op PPI** [^1139J3py]. This reflects the standard of care: secure endoscopic hemostasis [^111rjcAj], then give high-dose IV PPI (80 mg bolus → 8 mg/h infusion) for 72 hours [^112WxE8t] to reduce rebleeding risk [^116sczUY]. Surgery (vagotomy ± pyloroplasty) is reserved for refractory bleeding or endoscopic failure [^113WkJDZ], not first-line therapy [^1112pdab]. Highly selective vagotomy is outdated and not indicated in acute bleeding [^116cT4LV].

---

## Clinical scenario analysis

The patient presents with **severe hematemesis, hypotension, and a hemoglobin level of 9 g/dL**, indicating significant acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) with hemodynamic instability [^1127G6rW]. Endoscopy reveals a 2×2 cm ulcer, suggesting a bleeding peptic ulcer as the likely source [^112QFf8u]. The management priorities are:

- **Immediate hemodynamic stabilization**: Rapid intravenous fluid resuscitation and blood transfusion to restore hemodynamic stability [^1112pdab].

- **Early endoscopic intervention**: Urgent upper endoscopy within 24 hours [^111rjcAj] to identify and treat the bleeding source [^113UD35P].

- **Pharmacologic acid suppression**: High-dose proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy to reduce gastric acid secretion and stabilize clot formation [^113styHD].

---

## Management options evaluation

### Option 1: Stop the bleeding + highly selective truncal vagotomy

Highly selective vagotomy (HSV) is a surgical procedure that selectively denervates the acid-producing parietal cells, reducing acid secretion while preserving pyloric innervation [^notfound]. Historically, HSV was used for refractory peptic ulcer disease, but it has largely been supplanted by medical therapy and endoscopic interventions [^113UifXL]. In acute bleeding, HSV is not indicated as **first-line therapy** because it does not address immediate hemostasis and carries surgical risks [^113WkJDZ].

---

### Option 2: Stop the bleeding + post-op PPI

This option aligns with current evidence-based practice: secure **endoscopic hemostasis** followed by high-dose intravenous PPI therapy [^111rjcAj]. Endoscopic hemostasis is the cornerstone of acute UGIB management, achieving hemostasis in **over 90% of cases** [^113YtX5X]. High-dose PPI therapy (e.g. 80 mg bolus followed by 8 mg/hour continuous infusion for 72 hours) significantly reduces rebleeding, need for surgery, and mortality [^113styHD].

---

### Option 3: Stop the bleeding + truncal vagotomy + pyloroplasty

Truncal vagotomy with pyloroplasty is a surgical procedure that reduces acid secretion and improves gastric emptying [^112Ce6t7]. While historically used for refractory peptic ulcer disease, it is now reserved for cases of recurrent or refractory bleeding despite endoscopic therapy [^113WkJDZ]. As **first-line therapy** for acute bleeding, this option is overly invasive and unnecessary given the efficacy of endoscopic and medical management [^1112pdab].

---

## Evidence-based recommendations

Current guidelines and expert consensus strongly recommend the following:

- **Endoscopic hemostasis**: First-line treatment for acute nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding, including peptic ulcer bleeding [^111rjcAj].

- **High-dose PPI therapy**: Intravenous PPI therapy (80 mg bolus followed by 8 mg/hour infusion for 72 hours) after successful endoscopic hemostasis significantly reduces rebleeding and mortality [^113styHD].

- **Surgical intervention**: Reserved for cases of refractory bleeding or failure of endoscopic therapy [^113WkJDZ].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

The most appropriate management for this patient is **Option 2: Stop the bleeding + post-op PPI**. This approach ensures immediate hemostasis through endoscopic intervention, followed by high-dose PPI therapy to reduce rebleeding risk and improve outcomes [^116sczUY]. Surgical options (highly selective vagotomy or truncal vagotomy with pyloroplasty) are reserved for refractory cases and are not indicated as first-line therapy in acute bleeding [^113WkJDZ].

### Diagnosis and management of gastrointestinal hemorrhage: what you need to know [^112rKvE9]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Acute gastrointestinal (GI) hemorrhage is a common cause for hospital admission that requires prompt diagnosis and multidisciplinary management to optimize clinical outcomes. Acute gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) includes both upper and lower GI tract sources with an extensive list of differential pathologies. This review provides a systematic approach to both upper and lower GIB management, emphasizing initial resuscitation, stabilization, diagnostic evaluation to identify the source, and treatment modalities. Endoscopy remains the cornerstone for diagnostic and interventional purposes, significantly reducing the need for surgical procedures. However, lower GIB and severe or refractory cases may necessitate additional imaging and interventions, including surgical management. Integrating clinical guidelines, evidence-based strategies, and individualized care, this review delineates what you need to know to diagnose and manage acute GI hemorrhage.

In patients who are hemodynamically stable and without serious comorbidities, endoscopy should be performed as soon as possible in a non-emergent setting to identify the substantial proportion with low-risk endoscopic findings who can be safely discharged. In patients with higher risk clinical features (e.g., tachycardia, hypotension, bloody emesis or NG aspirate in hospital), endoscopy within 12 h may be considered to potentially improve clinical outcomes.

### Gastrointestinal bleeding [^117XngpF]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Gastrointestinal bleeding is a common complaint encountered in the emergency department and frequent cause of hospitalization. Important diagnostic factors that increase morbidity and mortality include advanced age, serious comorbid conditions, hemodynamic instability, esophageal varices, significant hematemesis or melena, and marked anemia. Because gastrointestinal bleeding carries a 10% overall mortality rate, emergency physicians must perform timely diagnosis, aggressive resuscitation, risk stratification, and early consultation for these patients.

### Management of patients with acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding: an updated ACG guideline [^112K37Q7]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) — initial assessment and stabilization: A focused history, physical examination, and laboratory evaluation should be obtained at the time of patient presentation to assess the severity of bleeding and its possible location and etiology, and initial patient assessment and hemodynamic resuscitation should be performed simultaneously. Patients with hemodynamic instability and/or suspected ongoing bleeding should receive intravenous fluid resuscitation with the goal of optimization of blood pressure and heart rate before endoscopic evaluation/ intervention. Hematochezia associated with hemodynamic instability may be indicative of an UGIB source, and an upper endoscopy should be performed if the suspicion is high to exclude a proximal source of bleeding. Endoscopic hemostasis can be considered safe and effective in patients who have an INR of 2.5 or less. Platelets should be administered in the setting of severe LGIB to maintain a platelet count of > 30 × 10⁹/L, and a higher threshold of > 50 × 10⁹/L can be considered if endoscopic procedures are required, and there is no benefit to routine platelet transfusion for patients on antiplatelets.

Considerations

All patients should be assessed for evidence of hemodynamic compromise and low hemoglobin levels. The decision to transfuse should take into account the hemoglobin level, but practitioners should keep in mind that transfusion may carry the risks of complications. This decision should be weighed carefully for each individual patient. As common sense dictates, hypovolemic patients with acute massive blood loss who may only show a spuriously small drop in hemoglobin on presentation should be managed proactively according to the hemoglobin levels that are anticipated to show following volume resuscitation. Similarly, a higher target level of hemoglobin should be pursued in patients who have low tolerance to anemia because of comorbidities such as coronary artery disease, cardiac or renal failure. More research is necessary before sound recommendations can be made about the hemoglobin threshold for transfusion and the target hemoglobin levels.

Risk stratification, management of co-morbidities, and time to endoscopy

Many patients who experience upper GI bleeding have other medical co-morbidities which can affect their outcomes. Anticoagulation, in particular, is a treatment for many medical conditions, and recent guidelines recommend reversal of coagulopathy when it is identified. They make note, however, that reversal should not delay endoscopy.

There exists general consensus that patients presenting with upper GI bleeding should be considered for risk-stratification using an evidence-based scoring system such as the Rockall score or the Blatchford score. The two scores differ in their clinical predictions. The complete (post-endoscopy) Rockall score predicts the occurrence of rebleeding and mortality, and those patients who are at low risk for rebleeding and death can be safely discharged after endoscopy. The Blatchford score can be completed prior to endoscopy and predicts the need for intervention. There are no guidelines that recommend one particular risk-assessment score, though the NICE guidelines recommend performing the Blatchford score at first assessment and the complete Rockall score after endoscopy. NICE performed a rigorous systematic review and meta-analysis on the prognostic accuracy of these scoring systems. Both of them have higher sensitivity than specificity and therefore are mainly useful for ruling out high risk patients. The Blatchford score is extremely sensitive (99–100%), but the quality of evidence for this result is "low" according to Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE); the Rockall is slightly less sensitive (98%), but the quality of evidence for this is somehow better ("moderate" according to GRADE).

### Emergency medicine updates: upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^112QFf8u]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) is a condition commonly seen in the emergency department (ED). Therefore, it is important for emergency clinicians to be aware of the current evidence regarding the diagnosis and management of this disease.

Objective

This paper evaluates key evidence-based updates concerning UGIB for the emergency clinician.

Discussion

UGIB most frequently presents with hematemesis. There are numerous causes, with the most common peptic ulcer disease, though variceal bleeding in particular can be severe. Nasogastric tube lavage for diagnosis is not recommended based on the current evidence. A hemoglobin transfusion threshold of 7 g/dL is recommended (8 g/dL in those with myocardial ischemia), but patients with severe bleeding and hemodynamic instability require emergent transfusion regardless of their level. Medications that may be used in UGIB include proton pump inhibitors, prokinetic agents, and vasoactive medications. Antibiotics are recommended for those with cirrhosis and suspected variceal bleeding. Endoscopy is the diagnostic and therapeutic modality of choice and should be performed within 24 h of presentation in non-variceal bleeding after resuscitation, though patients with variceal bleeding may require endoscopy within 12 h. Transcatheter arterial embolization or surgical intervention may be necessary. Intubation should be avoided if possible. If intubation is necessary, several considerations are required, including resuscitation prior to induction, utilizing preoxygenation and appropriate suction, and administering a prokinetic agent. There are a variety of tools available for risk stratification, including the Glasgow Blatchford Score.

Conclusions

An understanding of literature updates can improve the ED care of patients with UGIB.

GUIDELINE STATEMENTS

Management of antithrombotic agents in the setting of acute GI bleeding

The first 10 guideline statements address the management of antithrombotic agents in the setting of acute GI bleeding. Acute GI bleeding is defined as patients hospitalized or under observation with acute overt GI bleeding (upper and/or lower) manifesting as melena, hematochezia, or hematemesis. Life-threatening hemorrhage is defined as major clinically overt or apparent bleeding, resulting in hypovolemic shock or severe hypotension requiring pressors or surgery; or associated with a decrease in hemoglobin of > 5 g/dL, or requiring transfusion of ≥ 5 units of packed red blood cells, or causing death.

VKA reversal.

For patients on warfarin who are hospitalized or under observation with acute GI bleeding, we suggest against fresh frozen plasma (FFP) administration (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence).

### The role of endoscopy in the patient with lower GI bleeding [^115vDW3H]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2014). Medium credibility.

Lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) epidemiology and outcomes — LGIB is diagnosed in 20% to 30% of all patients presenting with major gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding; the annual incidence of LGIB is 0.03%, it increases 200-fold from the second to eighth decades of life, and the mean age at presentation ranges from 63 to 77 years; approximately 35.7 per 100,000 adults in the United States are hospitalized for LGIB annually, and a full-time gastroenterologist manages more than 10 cases per year; although blood loss from LGIB can range from trivial to massive and life-threatening, the majority of patients have self-limited bleeding and an uncomplicated hospitalization; compared with acute upper GI bleeding (UGIB), patients with LGIB tend to present with a higher hemoglobin level and are less likely to develop hypotensive shock or require blood transfusions; the mortality rate ranges from 2% to 4%; and an epidemiologic study reported a decreased incidence of LGIB (41.8/100,000 in 2001 vs 35.7/100,000 in 2009; p = 0.02) and a lower age-adjusted and sex-adjusted case fatality rate (1.93% in 2001 vs 1.47% in 2009; p = 0.003).

### Management of patients with ulcer bleeding [^112wJ8kt]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2012). Medium credibility.

Ulcer bleeding — initial assessment, risk stratification, endoscopic therapy, and proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use are outlined as follows: Management of the patient presenting with overt bleeding proceeds in a step-wise manner, and the first step is assessment of hemodynamic status with initiation of resuscitative measures as needed; patients are risk stratified by clinical features, and most patients should receive an upper endoscopy within 24 hr or less, and endoscopic features of the ulcer assist in directing further management. Those with high-risk stigmata such as active bleeding or non-bleeding visible vessel should receive endoscopic therapy and those with an adherent clot may receive endoscopic therapy; these patients should then receive intravenous PPI therapy with a bolus followed by continuous infusion, whereas those with flat spots or clean-based ulcers do not require endoscopic therapy or intensive intravenous PPI therapy. Patients with recurrent bleeding after endoscopic therapy should be treated with repeat endoscopic therapy.

### How would you manage this patient with nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding? grand rounds discussion from beth Israel deaconess medical center [^1176xQkE]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding is common, morbid, and potentially fatal. Cornerstones of inpatient management include fluid resuscitation; blood transfusion; endoscopy; and initiation of proton-pump inhibitor therapy, which continues in an individualized manner based on risk factors for recurrent bleeding in the outpatient setting. The International Consensus Group released guidelines on the management of nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding in 2019. These guidelines provide a helpful, evidence-based roadmap for management of gastrointestinal bleeding but leave certain management details to the discretion of the treating physician. Here, 2 gastroenterologists consider the care of a patient with nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding from a peptic ulcer, specifically debating approaches to blood transfusion and endoscopy timing in the hospital, as well as the recommended duration of proton-pump inhibitor therapy after discharge.

Patient management and clinical endpoints

All patients presenting with NVUGIB received an immediate 8 mg/h proton pump inhibitor infusion after an 80 mg bolus. The standard approach for fluid resuscitation was 3–5 ml/kg/hour infusion following a 10 ml/kg bolus saline infusion, in cases of hypotension bolus dose 20 ml/kg. Based on blood pressure and urine output, the infusion rate was titrated. The goal mean arterial pressure was > 65 mmHg and urine output were > 0.5 ml/kg/hour. Regarding the patient's comorbidities, aggressive fluid resuscitation was avoided in normotensive individuals to prevent volume overload. Erythrocyte suspension transfusion was administered to increase the target hemoglobin level to > 9 g/dl in patients over 65 years, with chronic lung disease or coronary artery disease; in younger patients, the target hemoglobin level was 7–9 g/dl. During the first twelve hours, endoscopic intervention was performed on patients who continued bleeding, had an unstable hemodynamic state, or had a lower hematocrit even after transfusion. Within the first 12 to 48 h, patients who were clinically stable and had not experienced severe bleeding underwent an endoscopy. Each patient's time of ES admission and the beginning of the endoscopic examination were recorded, and the gap between them was called the "time to endoscopy". In endoscopic treatment, the endoscopist applied depending on the characteristics of the lesion either thermal contact or mechanical techniques combined with adrenaline injection. Adrenaline injection alone was not evaluated as an endoscopic treatment. Once an upper gastrointestinal endoscopic examination failed to detect a lesion, a colonoscopy was performed. For individuals whose colonoscopy identified no bleeding lesions or evidence of ongoing bleeding, no further procedure was carried out. An attempt was made to identify the bleeding focus in individuals with bleeding continued or rebleeding by computed CT angiography. In patients whose bleeding focus could not be detected, angiography by interventional radiology or double balloon enteroscopy was performed. Severe bleeding that did not respond to endoscopic therapy was referred for surgical or interventional radiology. CT angiography was performed on all patients who could not be stabilized despite intense resuscitation. Interventional radiologists performed coil embolization regardless of bleeding rate when extravasation was identified. Endoscopy was performed at the ICU bedside when extravasation failed to be detected. Once endoscopic therapy and coil embolization failed, surgery was the only option. All patients were followed up outpatient clinic visits in the second week and the first month after hospitalization. Study data were obtained following hospitalization by telephone visits or by scanning the national electronic registration system for patients who missed outpatient clinic visits.

Acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) — initial assessment and risk stratification: A focused history, physical examination, and laboratory evaluation should be obtained at the time of presentation to assess bleeding severity, location, and etiology; hematochezia with hemodynamic instability may be indicative of an upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) source and an upper endoscopy should be performed; a nasogastric aspirate/lavage may be used to assess a possible upper GI source if suspicion of UGIB is moderate; and risk assessment and stratification should be performed to distinguish high- vs low-risk patients and assist triage including timing of colonoscopy and level of care. Initial testing should include a complete blood count, serum electrolytes, coagulation studies, and a type and cross match, and the physical examination should include the measurement of vital signs, including orthostasis.

Pre-endoscopic approach and management

Resuscitation

All management guidelines recommend prompt assessment of hemodynamic status and resuscitation if required. Generally, the guidelines agree that red blood cell transfusions should be administered to patients whose hemoglobin levels drop to 70 g/L or less. In 2010, Heamshaw et al published a prospective cohort study assessing outcomes in patients who received blood transfusions within 12 h of presentation. They found that, regardless of the initial hemoglobin level (greater than or less than 80 g/L), the rates of rebleeding were higher in those who received early transfusion. The odds ratio (OR) for rebleeding was 2.26, adjusted for Rockall score and initial hemoglobin level. Mortality at 30 days was greater in those receiving transfusion, but not significantly so when adjusted for initial hemoglobin level and Rockall score. Previous randomized controlled trials (RCTs) had shown comparable results, but these were performed over a decade ago when appropriate endoscopic hemostasis was not offered in all high-risk patients.

However, a more recent RCT on this topic was published by Villanueva et al who randomized 921 patients (bleeding peptic ulcer 48%, variceal bleeding 24%) with upper GI bleeding to either a restrictive (transfuse at a hemoglobin level of 70 g/L) or liberal (transfuse at a hemoglobin level of 90 g/L) transfusion strategy. The patients were treated according to current standards of care with regards to proton pump inhibitor (PPI) treatment and endoscopic hemostasis. Patients treated with the restrictive strategy had significantly lower mortality at 45 days [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.55; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.33 to 0.92], less rebleeding, and experienced fewer overall adverse events. These findings attracted high publicity but should be interpreted with caution because of high risk of performance bias (due to lack of blinding) and limited generalizability (many potentially eligible patients were either not screened or excluded for reasons such as "massive" bleeding or severe comorbidity). Furthermore, the subgroup analyses on peptic ulcer bleeding versus variceal bleeding, albeit important, were underpowered; therefore, no conclusion could be drawn specifically for patients with peptic ulcer bleeding.

Upper gastrointestinal bleeding is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality, affecting 36 to 48 per 100,000 persons annually. Aggressive resuscitation and upper endoscopy remain the cornerstones of therapy; however, in cases refractory to endoscopic diagnosis and management, radiology plays an increasingly vital and often lifesaving role, thanks to improvements in both imaging and interventional techniques. The various etiologies of upper gastrointestinal bleeding are discussed along with specific management recommendations based on an extensive literature review of current radiographic methods.

### Diagnosis and management of acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding: European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) guideline [^1165fCHX]. Endoscopy (2021). Medium credibility.

1: ESGE recommends that the initial assessment of patients presenting with acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding should include: a history of co-morbidities and medications that promote bleeding; hemodynamic parameters; physical examination (including digital rectal examination); and laboratory markers. A risk score can be used to aid, but should not replace, clinician judgment. Strong recommendation, low quality evidence. 2: ESGE recommends that, in patients presenting with a self-limited bleed and no adverse clinical features, an Oakland score of ≤ 8 points can be used to guide the clinician decision to discharge the patient for outpatient investigation. Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence. 3: ESGE recommends, in hemodynamically stable patients with acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding and no history of cardiovascular disease, a restrictive red blood cell transfusion strategy, with a hemoglobin threshold of ≤ 7g/dL prompting red blood cell transfusion. A post-transfusion target hemoglobin concentration of 7–9g/dL is desirable. Strong recommendation, low quality evidence. 4: ESGE recommends, in hemodynamically stable patients with acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding and a history of acute or chronic cardiovascular disease, a more liberal red blood cell transfusion strategy, with a hemoglobin threshold of ≤ 8g/dL prompting red blood cell transfusion. A post-transfusion target hemoglobin concentration of ≥ 10g/dL is desirable. Strong recommendation, low quality evidence. 5: ESGE recommends that, in patients with major acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding, colonoscopy should be performed sometime during their hospital stay because there is no high quality evidence that early colonoscopy influences patient outcomes. Strong recommendation, low quality of evidence. 6: ESGE recommends that patients with hemodynamic instability and suspected ongoing bleeding undergo computed tomography angiography before endoscopic or radiologic treatment to locate the site of bleeding. Strong recommendation, low quality evidence. 7: ESGE recommends withholding vitamin K antagonists in patients with major lower gastrointestinal bleeding and correcting their coagulopathy according to the severity of bleeding and their thrombotic risk. In patients with hemodynamic instability, we recommend administering intravenous vitamin K and four-factor prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC), or fresh frozen plasma if PCC is not available. Strong recommendation, low quality evidence. 8: ESGE recommends temporarily withholding direct oral anticoagulants at presentation in patients with major lower gastrointestinal bleeding. Strong recommendation, low quality evidence. 9: ESGE does not recommend withholding aspirin in patients taking low dose aspirin for secondary cardiovascular prevention. If withheld, low dose aspirin should be resumed, preferably within 5 days or even earlier if hemostasis is achieved or there is no further evidence of bleeding. Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence. 10: ESGE does not recommend routinely discontinuing dual antiplatelet therapy (low dose aspirin and a P2Y12 receptor antagonist) before cardiology consultation. Continuation of the aspirin is recommended, whereas the P2Y12 receptor antagonist can be continued or temporarily interrupted according to the severity of bleeding and the ischemic risk. If interrupted, the P2Y12 receptor antagonist should be restarted within 5 days, if still indicated. Strong recommendation, low quality evidence.

### Determinants of empiric transfusion in gastrointestinal bleeding in the emergency department [^116SzVuU]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Current guidelines for the management of GI bleeding (GIB) recommend restrictive transfusion triggers unless patients have shock or specific comorbidities. However, these studies may not be applicable to Emergency Department (ED) patients. Factors determining transfusion decisions in the ED are poorly understood. We compared baseline characteristics and outcomes between ED patients with GI bleeding transfused at lower or higher empiric hemoglobin levels.

Methods

Single center, retrospective analysis of hospital records from a large tertiary care center of ED patients diagnosed with GIB who underwent red blood cell transfusion in the ED. A pre-transfusion hemoglobin cutoff of 7 g/dl was used to divide patients into restrictive and empirically transfused groups. Demographics, mortality, hospital length-of-stay, and mortality risk estimates were compared between groups.

Results

175 patients met inclusion criteria, with 120 restrictive patients (68.5%) and 55 liberal patients (31.4%). The sample was 49.7% male, with mean age 67.2 years, similar between groups. Patients in the empiric transfusion group had more acute emergency severity index scores (2.09 vs. 2.3). No difference was found between groups in triage vital signs, pre-endoscopy Rockall scores or mortality estimates, or length of stay. Most common reasons for empiric transfusion from chart review were hypotension and witnessed large hemorrhage.

Conclusions

Patients that were empirically transfused had similar presentations to patients meeting restrictive guidelines, based on review of triage data. Transfusions above restrictive thresholds occurred frequently in our population. Additional studies are required to clarify appropriate criteria to guide transfusions for GIB in the ED.

### Patient presentation, risk stratification, and initial management in acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding [^1137DXqf]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

The approach to lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) has evolved over the last few years to incorporate a multidisciplinary management strategy. Although the causes of LGIB vary depending on the age and comorbid conditions of patients, the initial resuscitation and principles of optimizing patients' condition before endoscopic evaluation, when appropriate, are the cornerstones to clinical care. The role of risk stratification is to triage patients as well as to mobilize health care resources based on predicted outcomes. Individualized management according to patients' comorbid conditions has been a focus in most recent guidelines.

Coagulopathy is also a marker for other comorbidites, such as chronic liver disease. Bleeding in these patients is often more severe, and coagulopathy should be corrected in those with active bleeding. The target INR has not been defined and is established by the patient's indication for anticoagulation. A study showed that mild to moderate anticoagulation (INR 1,3–2,7) at endoscopy did not increase the risk of recurrent bleeding compared with an INR of less than 1,3.

One small cohort study with a historical comparison showed that aggressive resuscitation including correction of coagulation (INR < 1,8) led to lower mortality rates.

Although numerous factors from the patient history, physical examination, and initial tests have been examined for an association with a need for intervention, no single factor is sufficiently predictive of UGIB severity to be used for triage.

The most predictive individual factors are a history of malignancy, presentation with hematemesis, signs of hypovolemia including hypotension, tachycardia and shock, and a haemoglobin < 8 g/dL.

Some factors, such as a history of aspirin or NSAIDs use, may not be useful for immediate disposition but are still important to assess for future management (e.g. if PUB were the aetiology of UGIB, then NSAIDs use should be discontinued). Patients who have significant comorbidities may require admission regardless of the severity of the UGIB.

Several scoring systems have been created and/or validated for this purpose, including APACHE II, Forrest classification, Blatchford score, pre-endoscopic Rockall score. Some of these may be cumbersome (APACHE II) or require data not immediately available based on initial clinical assessment (the Rockall Scoring System, for instance, requires endoscopic data) and therefore may be of limited utility in the acute setting.

### Upper gastrointestinal bleeding in adults: evaluation and management [^1127G6rW]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is defined as hemorrhage from the mouth to the ligament of Treitz. Common risk factors for upper GI bleeding include prior upper GI bleeding, anticoagulant use, high-dose nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use, and older age. Causes of upper GI bleeding include peptic ulcer bleeding, gastritis, esophagitis, variceal bleeding, Mallory-Weiss syndrome, and cancer. Signs and symptoms of upper GI bleeding may include abdominal pain, lightheadedness, dizziness, syncope, hematemesis, and melena. Physical examination includes assessment of hemodynamic stability, presence of abdominal pain or rebound tenderness, and examination of stool color. Laboratory tests should include a complete blood count, basic metabolic panel, coagulation panel, liver tests, and type and crossmatch. A bolus of normal saline or lactated Ringer solution should be rapidly infused to correct hypovolemia and to maintain blood pressure, and blood should be transfused when hemoglobin is less than 7 g per dL. Clinical prediction guides (e.g. Glasgow-Blatchford bleeding score) are necessary for upper GI bleeding risk stratification and to determine therapy. Patients with hemodynamic instability and signs of upper GI bleeding should be offered urgent endoscopy, performed within 24 hours of presentation. A common strategy in patients with failed endoscopic hemostasis is to attempt transcatheter arterial embolization, then proceed to surgery if hemostasis is not obtained. Proton pump inhibitors should be initiated upon presentation with upper GI bleeding. Guidelines recommend high-dose proton pump inhibitor treatment for the first 72 hours post-endoscopy because this is when rebleeding risk is highest. Deciding when to restart antithrombotic therapy after upper GI bleeding is difficult because of lack of sufficient data.

### Diagnosis and management of nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage: European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) guideline [^112WxE8t]. Endoscopy (2015). Low credibility.

This Guideline is an official statement of the European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE). It addresses the diagnosis and management of nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage (NVUGIH). Main Recommendations MR1. ESGE recommends immediate assessment of hemodynamic status in patients who present with acute upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage (UGIH), with prompt intravascular volume replacement initially using crystalloid fluids if hemodynamic instability exists (strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence). MR2. ESGE recommends a restrictive red blood cell transfusion strategy that aims for a target hemoglobin between 7g/dL and 9g/dL. A higher target hemoglobin should be considered in patients with significant co-morbidity (e.g., ischemic cardiovascular disease) (strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence). MR3. ESGE recommends the use of the Glasgow-Blatchford Score (GBS) for pre-endoscopy risk stratification. Outpatients determined to be at very low risk, based upon a GBS score of 0–1, do not require early endoscopy nor hospital admission. Discharged patients should be informed of the risk of recurrent bleeding and be advised to maintain contact with the discharging hospital (strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence). MR4. ESGE recommends initiating high dose intravenous proton pump inhibitors (PPI), intravenous bolus followed by continuous infusion (80mg then 8mg/hour), in patients presenting with acute UGIH awaiting upper endoscopy. However, PPI infusion should not delay the performance of early endoscopy (strong recommendation, high quality evidence). MR5. ESGE does not recommend the routine use of nasogastric or orogastric aspiration/lavage in patients presenting with acute UGIH (strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence). MR6. ESGE recommends intravenous erythromycin (single dose, 250mg given 30–120 minutes prior to upper gastrointestinal [GI] endoscopy) in patients with clinically severe or ongoing active UGIH. In selected patients, pre-endoscopic infusion of erythromycin significantly improves endoscopic visualization, reduces the need for second-look endoscopy, decreases the number of units of blood transfused, and reduces duration of hospital stay (strong recommendation, high quality evidence). MR7. Following hemodynamic resuscitation, ESGE recommends early (≤ 24 hours) upper GI endoscopy. Very early (< 12 hours) upper GI endoscopy may be considered in patients with high risk clinical features, namely: hemodynamic instability (tachycardia, hypotension) that persists despite ongoing attempts at volume resuscitation; in-hospital bloody emesis/nasogastric aspirate; or contraindication to the interruption of anticoagulation (strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence). MR8. ESGE recommends that peptic ulcers with spurting or oozing bleeding (Forrest classification Ia and Ib, respectively) or with a nonbleeding visible vessel (Forrest classification IIa) receive endoscopic hemostasis because these lesions are at high risk for persistent bleeding or rebleeding (strong recommendation, high quality evidence). MR9. ESGE recommends that peptic ulcers with an adherent clot (Forrest classification IIb) be considered for endoscopic clot removal. Once the clot is removed, any identified underlying active bleeding (Forrest classification Ia or Ib) or nonbleeding visible vessel (Forrest classification IIa) should receive endoscopic hemostasis (weak recommendation, moderate quality evidence). MR10. In patients with peptic ulcers having a flat pigmented spot (Forrest classification IIc) or clean base (Forrest classification III), ESGE does not recommend endoscopic hemostasis as these stigmata present a low risk of recurrent bleeding. In selected clinical settings, these patients may be discharged to home on standard PPI therapy, e.g., oral PPI once-daily (strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence). MR11. ESGE recommends that epinephrine injection therapy not be used as endoscopic monotherapy. If used, it should be combined with a second endoscopic hemostasis modality (strong recommendation, high quality evidence). MR12. ESGE recommends PPI therapy for patients who receive endoscopic hemostasis and for patients with adherent clot not receiving endoscopic hemostasis. PPI therapy should be high dose and administered as an intravenous bolus followed by continuous infusion (80mg then 8mg/hour) for 72 hours post endoscopy (strong recommendation, high quality evidence). MR13. ESGE does not recommend routine second-look endoscopy as part of the management of nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage (NVUGIH). However, in patients with clinical evidence of rebleeding following successful initial endoscopic hemostasis, ESGE recommends repeat upper endoscopy with hemostasis if indicated. In the case of failure of this second attempt at hemostasis, transcatheter angiographic embolization (TAE) or surgery should be considered (strong recommendation, high quality evidence). MR14. In patients with NVUGIH secondary to peptic ulcer, ESGE recommends investigating for the presence of Helicobacter pylori in the acute setting with initiation of appropriate antibiotic therapy when H. pylori is detected. Re-testing for H. pylori should be performed in those patients with a negative test in the acute setting. Documentation of successful H. pylori eradication is recommended (strong recommendation, high quality evidence). MR15. In patients receiving low dose aspirin for secondary cardiovascular prophylaxis who develop peptic ulcer bleeding, ESGE recommends aspirin be resumed immediately following index endoscopy if the risk of rebleeding is low (e.g. FIIc, FIII). In patients with high risk peptic ulcer (FIa, FIb, FIIa, FIIb), early reintroduction of aspirin by day 3 after index endoscopy is recommended, provided that adequate hemostasis has been established (strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence).

### Management of patients with ulcer bleeding [^114RqkRT]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2012). Medium credibility.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for peptic ulcer disease, more specifically with respect to risk and severity assessment, bleeding ulcer, ACG 2012 guidelines recommend to consider discharging patients from the emergency department without inpatient endoscopy if the urea nitrogen < 18.2 mg/dL, hemoglobin ≥ 13.0 g/dL for males (12.0 g/dL for females), SBP ≥ 110 mmHg, pulse < 100 bpm, and absence of melena, syncope, cardiac failure, and liver disease, as they have < 1% chance of requiring intervention.

### ACG clinical guideline: upper gastrointestinal and ulcer bleeding [^113P2PSS]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Overt upper gastrointestinal bleeding — initial triage and pre-endoscopic management algorithm: Very-Low Clinical Risk, defined as risk score indicating 0–1% false negatives for transfusion, hemostatic intervention, or death with Glasgow-Blatchford Score 0–1, is managed with discharge from the emergency department with outpatient management if no other reason for hospitalization, whereas Not Very-Low Clinical Risk, defined as risk score indicating > 1% false negatives with Glasgow-Blatchford Score ≥ 2, is managed with admission to hospital or observation unit. Pre-endoscopic management includes resuscitation and attention to active comorbidities, RBC transfusion if hemoglobin < 7 g/dL, suggesting erythromycin 250mg infusion 30–90 minutes before upper endoscopy, and there is no recommendation for or against proton pump inhibitors. The pathway specifies upper endoscopy within 24 hours of presentation; after endoscopy, low-risk endoscopic findings such as clean-based ulcer, nonbleeding Mallory-Weiss tear, or erosions lead to discharge if stable vital signs and hemoglobin and no other reason for hospitalization, whereas non-low-risk findings such as ulcer with stigmata of hemorrhage, varices, neoplasm, or Dieulafoy lesion result in the patient remaining in hospital.

### Diagnosis and management of nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^115mN3UU]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2012). Medium credibility.

Nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Despite the improvements in the management of this condition in western countries, mortality rates have remained at 5–10% over the past decade. This article presents the main recommendations for the management of UGIB. Pre-endoscopic management (including use of scoring scales, nasogastric tube placement and blood pressure stabilization) is crucial for triage and optimal resuscitation of patients, and should include a multidisciplinary approach at an early stage. Unless the patient has specific comorbidities, transfusion should only be considered if their hemoglobin level is ≤ 70 g/l. Endoscopic therapy, the cornerstone of therapeutic management of high-risk lesions, should not be delayed for more than 24 h following admission. Several endoscopic techniques, mostly using clips or thermal methods, are available and new approaches are emerging. When endoscopy fails, surgery or arterial embolization should be considered. Although the efficacy of prokinetics and high-dose intravenous PPI prior to endoscopy is controversial, the use of an intravenous PPI following endoscopy is strongly recommended. Antiplatelet therapy should be suspended and resumed in 3–5 days. Finally, all patients should be tested for Helicobacter pylori by serology in the acute setting.

Methods

These consensus guidelines are an update of the 2013 WSES position paper on this topic. To create these guidelines, a panel of experts was designed and charged by the board of the WSES to develop questions on six main topics that thoroughly cover the field of this pathology (diagnosis, resuscitation, nonoperative management, surgery, angiography-angioembolization, antimicrobial therapy). Then, leading specialists in the field were asked to perform a thorough search on each of these topics in different databanks (MEDLINE, SCOPUS, EMBASE) for relevant papers between 1985 and June 2018 and a systematic review of the available literature. They were asked to focus their search in order to provide evidence-based answers to every question with immediate practical application and to summarize them in statements. All the statements were presented and discussed during the 5 th WSES Congress held in Bertinoro, Italy in June 28th, 2018. For each statement, a consensus among the WSES panel of experts was reached. All the members contributed to the development of the manuscript; the manuscript was reviewed and approved by all the authors.

The present guidelines have been developed according to the GRADE methodology.

Topics and questions

For clarity, we report the six topics together with the questions dividend into each of them.

Diagnosis

In patients with a suspected perforated peptic ulcer, which are the appropriate biochemical and imaging investigations that should be requested?
In patients with perforated peptic ulcer, what is the clinical value of risk scores such as Boey Score and Pulp score?
In patients with suspected bleeding peptic ulcer, which biochemical and imaging investigations should be requested?
In patients with suspected bleeding peptic ulcer, what is the diagnostic role of endoscopy?
In patients with bleeding peptic ulcer, are the endoscopic findings useful to determine the risk for rebleeding and how do they affect the clinical management?

Resuscitation

In patients with perforated peptic ulcer, which parameters should be evaluated ad ED referral?
In patients with perforated peptic ulcer, which are the appropriate targets for resuscitation (hemoglobin level, blood pressure/heart rate, lactates level, others)?
In patients with bleeding peptic ulcer, which parameters should be evaluated at ED referral and which criteria should be adopted to define an unstable patient?
In patients with bleeding peptic ulcer, which are the appropriate targets for resuscitation (hemoglobin level, blood pressure/heart rate, lactates level, others)?

### Management of patients with ulcer bleeding [^111UzQzk]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2012). Medium credibility.

Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) gastric lavage and timing of endoscopy — nasogastric or orogastric lavage is not required in patients with UGIB for diagnosis, prognosis, visualization, or therapeutic effect (Conditional recommendation). Patients with UGIB should generally undergo endoscopy within 24 h of admission, following resuscitative efforts to optimize hemodynamic parameters and other medical problems (Conditional recommendation). In patients who are hemodynamically stable and without serious comorbidities endoscopy should be performed as soon as possible in a non-emergent setting to allow for the substantial majority with low-risk endoscopic findings who can be safely discharged (Conditional recommendation). In patients with higher risk clinical features (e.g., tachycardia, hypotension, bloody emesis or nasogastric aspirate in hospital) endoscopy within 12 h may be considered to potentially improve clinical outcomes (Conditional recommendation).

ACG acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) initial assessment and risk stratification — A focused history, physical examination, and laboratory evaluation should be obtained at the time of patient presentation, and initial patient assessment and hemodynamic resuscitation should be performed simultaneously (strong recommendation); hematochezia with hemodynamic instability may be indicative of an UGIB source and an upper endoscopy should be performed, with a nasogastric aspirate/lavage used to assess a possible upper GI source if suspicion of UGIB is moderate (strong recommendation); and risk assessment and stratification should be performed to help distinguish high- and low-risk patients and assist triage including the timing of colonoscopy and the level of care (conditional recommendation).

### Injection and cautery methods for nonvariceal bleeding control [^116T4947]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Upper gastrointestinal bleeding remains one of the most common challenges faced by gastroenterologists and endoscopists in daily clinical practice. Endoscopic management of nonvariceal bleeding has been shown to improve clinical outcomes, with significant reduction of recurrent bleeding, need for surgery, and mortality. Early upper gastrointestinal endoscopy is recommended in all patients presenting with upper gastrointestinal bleeding within 24 hours of presentation, although appropriate resuscitation, stabilization of hemodynamic parameters, and optimization of comorbidity before endoscopy are essential.

### Management of massive peptic ulcer bleeding [^113qRmqs]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Massive bleeding from a peptic ulcer remains a challenge. A multidisciplinary team of skilled endoscopists, intensive care specialists, experienced upper gastrointestinal surgeons, and intervention radiologists all have a role to play. Endoscopy is the first-line treatment. Even with larger ulcers, endoscopic hemostasis can be achieved in the majority of cases. Surgery is clearly indicated in patients in whom arterial bleeding cannot be controlled at endoscopy. Angiographic embolization is an alternate option, particularly in those unfit for surgery. In selected patients judged to belong to the high-risk group — ulcers 2 cm or greater in size located at the lesser curve and posterior bulbar duodenal, shock on presentation, and elderly with comorbid illnesses — a more aggressive postendoscopy management is warranted. The optimal course of action is unclear. Most would be expectant and offer medical therapy in the form of acid suppression. Surgical series suggest that early elective surgery may improve outcome. Angiography allows the bleeding artery to be characterized, and coil embolization of larger arteries may further add to endoscopic hemostasis. The role of early elective surgery or angiographic embolization in selected high-risk patients to forestall recurrent bleeding remains controversial. Prospective studies are needed to compare different management strategies in these high-risk ulcers.

High-risk ulcer bleeding — endoscopy timing outcomes: A randomized trial comparing endoscopy within 12h versus > 12h after presentation found no significant benefit in bleeding, surgery, or mortality; subgroup patients with a bloody nasogastric aspirate had significantly fewer transfused units and hospital days. In an observational study of high-risk UGIB (Blatchford score ≥ 12), mortality was higher when endoscopy occurred > 13h after presentation (44%) than with earlier endoscopy (9%, P < 0.001), and presentation-to-endoscopy time was the only variable significantly associated with mortality.

### AGA clinical practice update on endoscopic therapies for non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding: expert review [^116sczUY]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding — initial medical management and antithrombotic considerations: Target hemoglobin is generally 9 g/dL in patients with significant cardiovascular disease and 7 g/dL for all others, and the consensus recommendation was for blood transfusion for hemoglobin levels < 8 g/dL with a threshold for those with cardiovascular disease. Intravenous proton pump inhibitors should be administered to all patients with suspected NVUGIB and should not delay endoscopic intervention, and high-dose intravenous proton pump inhibitors should be continued post endoscopy because their use is associated with decreased risk of rebleeding. The need for reversal of antithrombotic medications requires careful consideration of the risks of thromboembolic events, these decisions should be made by the gastroenterologist in consultation with intensivists, cardiologists, neurologists, and hematologists, and when there is doubt, it is usually better to err on the side of not reversing AT medication because a cardiopulmonary or neurologic thromboembolic event is usually far more devastating than ongoing NVUGIB.

### Management of patients with acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding: an updated ACG guideline [^113Ncu8G]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Hemodynamic resuscitation in unstable lower gastrointestinal bleeding — Patients with hemodynamic instability and/or suspected ongoing bleeding should receive intravenous fluid resuscitation with the goal of optimization of blood pressure and heart rate before endoscopic evaluation/intervention. Patients who are hemodynamically unstable should receive intravenous fluid resuscitation with crystalloids with the goal of normalization of blood pressure and heart rate before any diagnostic or therapeutic intervention.

### Management of patients with ulcer bleeding [^116zTmAg]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2012). Medium credibility.

Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) — evidence on early endoscopy timing and disposition: Early endoscopy has been variably defined as within 2–24 h of presentation; studies show that patients undergoing endoscopy within 8 h of presentation have more high-risk stigmata, while observational studies do not document a benefit in clinical outcomes for endoscopy performed within 1–2 h of presentation. Thus, endoscopy within 24 h appears appropriate in hospitalized UGIB, with risk stratification also having a role in decisions regarding timing. In low-risk randomized trials, endoscopy within 2 h vs within 48 h in 110 hemodynamically stable patients found no significant improvements in end points such as bleeding, surgery, or mortality; the length of hospital stay, post-discharge unplanned physician visits, and costs were significantly decreased, and Forty-six percent were discharged home immediately without rebleeding or repeat endoscopy during the next month. A second randomized trial comparing early endoscopy within 6 h vs within 48 h in 93 patients showed no significant benefits in clinical end points or resource utilization; although discharge without hospitalization was recommended in 40% meeting criteria for early discharge, this advice was followed in only 9%. Both studies suggest potential for early discharge in up to ~40–45% of patients.

### Management of patients with acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding: an updated ACG guideline [^114QVy2W]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Initial management — initial triage/evaluation emphasizes comprehensive bedside assessment: "A thorough history and physical examination is needed to determine potential sources of bleeding and help identify patients at risk of severe bleeding and adverse outcomes such as rebleeding and mortality". History should cover "cardiovascular, oncologic, or renal comorbidities; GI surgeries; and associated symptoms such as abdominal pain, alteration in bowel habits, or unintentional weight loss". Examination should include "careful attention to vital signs and assessment for signs of hypovolemia", and "Careful rectal examination can help determine whether a bleeding source may be emanating from the anorectal region or indicate the presence of melena, which may increase the likelihood of an UGIB". Medication review should assess "NSAIDs, antiplatelets, and anticoagulants", and "findings such as a preceding history of decompensated liver disease or prior peptic ulcer disease… or visible stigmata of advanced liver disease may indicate the possibility of an upper GI source of bleeding in a patient with severe hematochezia".

### AGA clinical practice update on management of bleeding gastric varices: expert review [^112TBySt]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Table 2 — evidenced-based algorithm for initial management of suspected portal hypertensive bleeding specifies to ensure adequate vascular access with 2 large-bore peripheral intravenous cannulae or central venous access and provide fluid resuscitation with colloid or crystalloid, and to assess airway protection with tracheal intubation advised for active hematemesis, inability to maintain or protect airway, and to enable optimal sedation for endoscopic therapy. Vasoactive therapy includes octreotide initial intravenous bolus of 50 μg (can be repeated in first hour if ongoing bleeding) followed by continuous intravenous infusion of octreotide 50 μg/h for 2–5 d (may stop after definitive hemostasis achieved), and somatostatin analogs inhibit gastric acid secretion so co-administration of proton pump inhibitor is not required. Antibiotic prophylaxis is emphasized, with intravenous ceftriaxone 1 g/24 h (maximal duration 7 d) since prophylactic antibiotics reduce infections, rebleeding, and mortality. A restrictive red blood cell transfusion strategy is outlined: transfuse at Hgb threshold of 7 g/dL and goal maintenance Hgb of 7–9 g/dL, with restrictive transfusion associated with favorable effect on hepatic venous pressure gradient, decreased mortality, and decreased rate for early rebleeding; avoid overuse of blood products in cirrhosis given risks including precipitation of portal venous thrombosis. Urgent endoscopic assessment for source control should follow stabilization, within 12 h of presentation, and consider erythromycin before emergency endoscopy (250 mg intravenous, 30–120 min before) to optimize visualization with QT interval check; patients with acute variceal hemorrhage should be managed within the intensive care unit or other well-monitored units given mortality risk and care complexity.

### Management of nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding: guideline recommendations from the international consensus group [^113styHD]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Description

This update of the 2010 International Consensus Recommendations on the Management of Patients With Nonvariceal Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding (UGIB) refines previous important statements and presents new clinically relevant recommendations.

Methods

An international multidisciplinary group of experts developed the recommendations. Data sources included evidence summarized in previous recommendations, as well as systematic reviews and trials identified from a series of literature searches of several electronic bibliographic databases from inception to April 2018. Using an iterative process, group members formulated key questions. Two methodologists prepared evidence profiles and assessed quality (certainty) of evidence relevant to the key questions according to the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach. Group members reviewed the evidence profiles and, using a consensus process, voted on recommendations and determined the strength of recommendations as strong or conditional.

Recommendations

Preendoscopic management: The group suggests using a Glasgow Blatchford score of 1 or less to identify patients at very low risk for rebleeding, who may not require hospitalization. In patients without cardiovascular disease, the suggested hemoglobin threshold for blood transfusion is less than 80 g/L, with a higher threshold for those with cardiovascular disease. Endoscopic management: The group suggests that patients with acute UGIB undergo endoscopy within 24 hours of presentation. Thermocoagulation and sclerosant injection are recommended, and clips are suggested, for endoscopic therapy in patients with high-risk stigmata. Use of TC-325 (hemostatic powder) was suggested as temporizing therapy, but not as sole treatment, in patients with actively bleeding ulcers. Pharmacologic management: The group recommends that patients with bleeding ulcers with high-risk stigmata who have had successful endoscopic therapy receive high-dose proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy (intravenous loading dose followed by continuous infusion) for 3 days. For these high-risk patients, continued oral PPI therapy is suggested twice daily through 14 days, then once daily for a total duration that depends on the nature of the bleeding lesion. Secondary prophylaxis: The group suggests PPI therapy for patients with previous ulcer bleeding who require antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy for cardiovascular prophylaxis.

### Recent advances on the management of patients with non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^114NBmMJ]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusions

NVUGIB is a common and serious condition that, unfortunately, still carries a high degree of mortality. While the advances of the past few years promise to improve management, they also open up new questions and avenues for investigation. There is now growing evidence that the use of prokinetic agents can benefit certain subsets of patients with upper GI bleeding, but more research will likely be required before their use is adopted by all major guideline committees. The introduction of novel hemostatic methods, such as nanopowders, offers exciting new possibilities for the mechanical management of bleeding lesions. More research should also be devoted to investigating the various other mechanical and injectable hemostatic modalities that are already more widely in use. The appropriate hemoglobin level for consideration of red blood cell transfusion and the optimal dose and route of administration for PPI after endoscopy are unclear, but stronger evidence is required before firm changes can be made to practice guidelines. Finally, much of the data that exists focuses specifically on the treatment of peptic ulcer bleeding; studies on the optimal ways to manage the other entities that result in upper GI bleeding require strong consideration as well.

Although current evidence does not appear to support urgent endoscopy at less than 6 h, some variceal bleeding guidelines advise that endoscopy should be performed at between 12 h and 24 h. Exact timing of endoscopy can be challenging and should be decided on the basis of thorough clinical assessment, including haemodynamics and underlying comorbidities. Appropriate resuscitation and optimisation of comorbidities is essential before endoscopy.

### Management of patients with ulcer bleeding [^114ZJw7s]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2012). Medium credibility.

ACG Practice Guidelines — Scope, evidence review, and grading — focus on ulcer-related UGIB and use GRADE for recommendations. Ulcers are the most common cause of hospitalization for UGIB, and this guideline addresses the management of patients with overt UGIB due to gastric or duodenal ulcers, where "overt" indicates hematemesis, melena, and/or hematochezia. The document covers initial assessment and risk stratification, pre-endoscopic use of medications and gastric lavage, timing of endoscopy, endoscopic and medical management, post-endoscopic medical therapy and disposition, and prevention of recurrent bleeding. Evidence review included a MEDLINE search using the MeSH term "gastrointestinal hemorrhage" limited to "all clinical trials" and "meta-analysis" for years 1966–2010 without language restriction. The GRADE system was used; the quality of evidence ranges from "high" to "very low" with stated definitions, and the strength of a recommendation is graded as strong when desirable effects clearly outweigh undesirable effects and conditional when uncertainty exists about the trade-offs; additional factors include variability in patient values and preferences and whether an intervention represents a wise use of resources.

Surgery

In patients with bleeding peptic ulcer, which are the indications for surgical treatment and which is the appropriate timing for surgery?

In patients with bleeding peptic ulcer, we suggest surgical hemostasis (or angiographic embolization if immediately available and with appropriate skills) after failure of repeated endoscopy. In patients with hypotension and/or hemodynamic instability and/or ulcer larger than 2 cm at first endoscopy, we suggest surgical intervention without repeated endoscopy (strong recommendation based on very low-quality evidences, 1D).

A renowned RCT conducted in 1999 compared endoscopic retreatment with surgery for peptic ulcer rebleeding after initial endoscopy. Over a 40-month period, 92 patients with recurrent bleeding were enrolled: 48 patients were randomly assigned to undergo immediate endoscopic retreatment and 44 were assigned to undergo surgery. Of the 48 patients who were assigned to endoscopic retreatment, 35 had long-term control of bleeding. Thirteen underwent salvage surgery, 11 because retreatment failed, and 2 because of perforations resulting from thermocoagulation. Five patients in the endoscopy group died within 30 days, as compared with eight patients in the surgery group (p = 0.37). Seven patients in the endoscopy group had complications, as compared with 16 in the surgery group (p = 0.03). Duration of hospitalization, need for ICU admission, ICU length of stay, and the number of blood transfusions were similar in the two groups. In multivariate analysis, hypotension at randomization (p = 0.01) and an ulcer size of at least 2 cm (p = 0.03) were independent factors predictive of the failure of endoscopic retreatment. According to these data, repeated endoscopy is indicated for stable patients with ulcers smaller than 2 cm in diameter, while for patients with a larger ulcer and heavier bleeding, surgery may be taken into account as a first-line therapy.

Repeat endoscopy — routine second-look endoscopy is not advised, but targeted repeat endoscopy is endorsed for recurrent bleeding. Routine second-look endoscopy, in which repeat endoscopy is performed 24h after initial endoscopic hemostatic therapy, is not recommended (Conditional recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). Repeat endoscopy should be performed in patients with clinical evidence of recurrent bleeding and endoscopic therapy should be applied in those with higher risk stigmata of hemorrhage (Strong recommendation, high-quality evidence).

### Management of acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^1112pdab]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) is a common medical emergency, with a reported mortality of 2–10%. Patients identified as being at very low risk of either needing an intervention or death can be managed as outpatients. For all other patients, intravenous fluids as needed for resuscitation and red cell transfusion at a hemoglobin threshold of 70–80 g/L are recommended. After resuscitation is initiated, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and the prokinetic agent erythromycin may be administered, with antibiotics and vasoactive drugs recommended in patients who have cirrhosis. Endoscopy should be undertaken within 24 hours, with earlier endoscopy considered after resuscitation in patients at high risk, such as those with hemodynamic instability. Endoscopic treatment is used for variceal bleeding (for example, ligation for esophageal varices and tissue glue for gastric varices) and for high risk non-variceal bleeding (for example, injection, thermal probes, or clips for lesions with active bleeding or non-bleeding visible vessel). Patients who require endoscopic therapy for ulcer bleeding should receive high dose proton pump inhibitors after endoscopy, whereas those who have variceal bleeding should continue taking antibiotics and vasoactive drugs. Recurrent ulcer bleeding is treated with repeat endoscopic therapy, with subsequent bleeding managed by interventional radiology or surgery. Recurrent variceal bleeding is generally treated with transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt. In patients who require antithrombotic agents, outcomes appear to be better when these drugs are reintroduced early.

1: ESGE recommends in patients with acute upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage (UGIH) the use of the Glasgow-Blatchford Score (GBS) for pre-endoscopy risk stratification. Patients with GBS ≤ 1 are at very low risk of rebleeding, mortality within 30 days, or needing hospital-based intervention and can be safely managed as outpatients with outpatient endoscopy. Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence. 2: ESGE recommends that in patients with acute UGIH who are taking low-dose aspirin as monotherapy for secondary cardiovascular prophylaxis, aspirin should not be interrupted. If for any reason it is interrupted, aspirin should be re-started as soon as possible, preferably within 3–5 days. Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence. 3: ESGE recommends that following hemodynamic resuscitation, early (≤ 24 hours) upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy should be performed. Strong recommendation, high quality evidence. 4: ESGE does not recommend urgent (≤ 12 hours) upper GI endoscopy since as compared to early endoscopy, patient outcomes are not improved. Strong recommendation, high quality evidence. 5: ESGE recommends for patients with actively bleeding ulcers (FIa, FIb), combination therapy using epinephrine injection plus a second hemostasis modality (contact thermal or mechanical therapy). Strong recommendation, high quality evidence. 6: ESGE recommends for patients with an ulcer with a nonbleeding visible vessel (FIIa), contact or noncontact thermal therapy, mechanical therapy, or injection of a sclerosing agent, each as monotherapy or in combination with epinephrine injection. Strong recommendation, high quality evidence. 7: ESGE suggests that in patients with persistent bleeding refractory to standard hemostasis modalities, the use of a topical hemostatic spray/powder or cap-mounted clip should be considered. Weak recommendation, low quality evidence. 8: ESGE recommends that for patients with clinical evidence of recurrent peptic ulcer hemorrhage, use of a cap-mounted clip should be considered. In the case of failure of this second attempt at endoscopic hemostasis, transcatheter angiographic embolization (TAE) should be considered. Surgery is indicated when TAE is not locally available or after failed TAE. Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence. 9: ESGE recommends high dose proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy for patients who receive endoscopic hemostasis and for patients with FIIb ulcer stigmata (adherent clot) not treated endoscopically. (A): PPI therapy should be administered as an intravenous bolus followed by continuous infusion (e.g., 80mg then 8mg/hour) for 72 hours post endoscopy. (B): High dose PPI therapies given as intravenous bolus dosing (twice-daily) or in oral formulation (twice-daily) can be considered as alternative regimens. Strong recommendation, high quality evidence. 10: ESGE recommends that in patients who require ongoing anticoagulation therapy following acute NVUGIH (e.g., peptic ulcer hemorrhage), anticoagulation should be resumed as soon as the bleeding has been controlled, preferably within or soon after 7 days of the bleeding event, based on thromboembolic risk. The rapid onset of action of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACS), as compared to vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), must be considered in this context. Strong recommendation, low quality evidence.

### Turn over the new leaf of the treatment in peptic ulcer bleeding: a review of the literature [^115BFPJM]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Challenging ulcer bleeding and salvage treatments

Despite advancements in endoscopic and pharmacological therapies, still a minority of patients (8%–15%) experience refractory peptic ulcer bleeding. Predictors of rebleeding include initial hemodynamic instability, low hemoglobin levels upon presentation, greater blood transfusion requirements, high-risk endoscopic stigmata, large ulcer size, and specific ulcer locations like posterior duodenal or high lesser gastric curvature ulcers. For patients with peptic ulcers who experience recurrent bleeding despite initial endoscopic treatment, a second-look endoscopy has shown long-term bleeding control with reduced complications, no increased mortality risk, and lower costs compared to surgery. Therefore, guidelines recommend a second-look endoscopy in such cases.

Malignancy-related ulcer bleeding is another challenge to manage. Due to local vessel invasion and friable neovascularization of tumors, malignant ulcers can rebleed even after initial hemostasis was achieved. Although surgery and endoscopic resection can remove the tumor, not all patients are appropriate candidates. Standard combination therapy with injection and thermal or mechanical treatment can reach 80%–90% initial hemostasis. However, the overall rebleeding rate of malignant ulcers is 40%, and the rebleeding rate within 30 days is 30%. Until now, there is no strongly recommended therapy for malignant bleeding in treatment guidelines.

If bleeding cannot be controlled through endoscopy, options such as transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) or surgical intervention should be considered. Although TAE has higher rebleeding rates compared with surgery, it is associated with significantly lower complication risks, shorter hospital stays, and no difference in mortality. Hence, TAE is the preferred salvage therapy for patients with failed endoscopic therapy, while surgery is considered when TAE is unavailable locally or after failed TAE attempts.

### Management of patients with rebleeding [^113YtX5X]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Peptic ulcer bleeding is a common emergency. Management of ulcer bleeding requires prompt risk stratification, initiation of pharmacotherapy, and timely evaluation for endoscopy. Although endoscopy can achieve primary hemostasis in more than 90% of peptic ulcer bleeding, rebleeding may occur in up to 15% of patients after therapeutic endoscopy and is associated with heightened mortality. Early identification of high-risk patients for rebleeding is important. Depending on bleeding severity and center availability, patients with rebleeding may be managed by second endoscopy, transarterial angiographic embolization, or surgery. This article reviews the current management of peptic ulcers with an emphasis on rebleeding.

The established quality indicators for early management of upper gastrointestinal (GI) hemorrhage are based on rapid diagnosis, risk stratification, and early management. Effective preendoscopic treatment may improve survivability of critically ill patients and improve resource allocation for all patients. Accurate risk stratification helps determine the need for hospital admission, hemodynamic monitoring, blood transfusion, and endoscopic hemostasis before esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) via indirect measures such as laboratory studies, physiologic data, and comorbidities. Early management before the definitive EGD is essential to improving outcomes for patients with upper GI bleeding.

Low- and high-risk clinical features — timing evidence indicates that in low-risk patients, two small RCTs found endoscopy within 2–6 hours identified low-risk endoscopic findings that should allow discharge with outpatient follow-up in at least 40% of patients, but differences in further bleeding or mortality were not identified and one study noted ∼80% of outpatient recommendations were not followed. A large cohort of 5,415 hemodynamically stable patients without significant comorbidities reported that endoscopy within 24 hours had adjusted OR = 0.59, 0.33–1.05 for in-hospital mortality but not 30-day mortality (adjusted OR = 1.02, 0.50–2.09). In high-risk settings, a nationwide Danish cohort found in-hospital mortality was lower with endoscopy 6–24 hours after admission in hemodynamically unstable patients and 12–36 hours after admission in hemodynamically stable patients with significant comorbidities (American Society of Anesthesiologists score 3–5) versus outside these timeframes, raising the possibility that very early endoscopy may cause harm if resuscitation and comorbidity management are not undertaken; conversely, a single-center Korean cohort reported reduced 28-day mortality with endoscopy within 6 hours vs 6–48 hours after presentation.

### What if endoscopic hemostasis fails? alternative treatment strategies: surgery [^112wQLTg]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Management of bleeding peptic ulcers is increasingly challenging in an aging population. Endoscopic therapy reduces the need for emergency surgery in bleeding peptic ulcers. Initial endoscopic control offers an opportunity for selecting high-risk ulcers for potential early preemptive surgery. However, such an approach has not been supported by evidence in the literature. Endoscopic retreatment can be an option to control ulcer rebleeding and reduce complications. The success of endoscopic retreatment largely depends on the severity of rebleeding and ulcer characteristics. Large chronic ulcers with urgent bleeding are less likely to respond to endoscopic retreatment. Expeditious surgery is advised.

### Asia-pacific working group consensus on non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding: an update 2018 [^114VTWJz]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

(Accept — agreement: 100%, level of evidence: moderate)

The timing of endoscopy in patients with NVUGIB is a matter of debate. The previous Asia-Pacific Working Group consensus recommended 'endoscopic intervention within 24 hours of onset of bleeding in patients at high risk". A systematic review concluded that endoscopy within 12 hours did not improve clinical outcome. It has also been pointed out that in patients at very high risk who are haemodynamically unstable and in patients presenting with massive haematemesis, endoscopy should be performed as soon as they are stabilised with resuscitation.

Several studies examined the role of urgent endoscopy (within 12 hours) in the management of NVUGIB. In a retrospective cohort of 361 patients, it was found that patients who underwent urgent endoscopy had a greater than fivefold increased risk of adverse outcome (death, inpatient rebleeding, surgery or radiological intervention or repeated endoscopic therapy). In a subgroup analysis from this study, time to endoscopy was not significant as a predictor of worse outcome, hence less prognostic in the high-risk patients than in lower-risk patients. A nationwide cohort study included 12 601 patients with peptic ulcer disease. It suggested that patients with haemodynamic instability or American Society of Anesthesiology score of 3–5 had reduced in-hospital mortality if receiving endoscopy within 6–24 hours after admission. However, the exact timing within 24 hours is still not clear. A nationwide survey from the UK included 4478 patients. It showed that earlier endoscopy (< 12 hours) was not associated with a lower mortality, or need for surgery, compared with endoscopy offered within 24 hours.

Non-colonoscopy interventions for acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding: A surgical consultation should be requested in patients with high-risk clinical features and ongoing bleeding. In general, surgery for acute LGIB should be considered after other therapeutic options have failed and should take into consideration the extent and success of prior bleeding control measures, severity and source of bleeding, and the level of comorbid disease. It is important to very carefully localize the source of bleeding whenever possible before surgical resection to avoid continued or recurrent bleeding from an unresected culprit lesion (conditional recommendation, very-low-quality evidence). Radiographic interventions should be considered in patients with high-risk clinical features and ongoing bleeding who have a negative upper endoscopy and do not respond adequately to hemodynamic resuscitation efforts and are therefore unlikely to tolerate bowel preparation and urgent colonoscopy (strong recommendation, very-low-quality evidence). If a diagnostic test is desired for localization of the bleeding site before angiography, CT angiography should be considered (conditional recommendation, very-low-quality evidence).

### Recent advances on the management of patients with non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^111CvEtw]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Non-variceal upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding (NVUGIB) is a common emergency, affecting 44 to 99 per 100,000 persons every year. Peptic ulcer bleeding is the principal cause of NVUGIB. Significant bleeding can result in major consequences, such as acute coronary syndromes. The mortality from NVUGIB remains high. A recent UK national audit found a 9.6% in-hospital mortality rate. Recurrence of bleeding occurs in 8–26% of patients, and is associated with an even higher mortality. Mortality is also increased in the elderly.

Such a serious disease inspires constant research in the hope of decreasing complications and mortality. A number of practice guidelines have been developed to help clinicians manage patients with NVUGIB, including those issued by the UK National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), an International Consensus meeting, and the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG). Of note, the Hellenic Society of Gastroenterology held a national consensus meeting on NVUGIB in Athens on June 8, 2008; the recommendations have not been published, but were remarkably similar to the International Consensus recommendations that were formed a few months later. The principle components of management include resuscitation, risk-stratification, endoscopy for diagnosis and appropriate intervention, and post-endoscopic acid-suppression. All of these factors are the subject of constant revision and rigorous testing to improve outcomes and, in the last three years in particular, the literature has grown considerably. This review serves to survey the most recent evidence to emerge in the management of NVUGIB and put in into context with recommendations from the recent practice guidelines.

Discussion

TAE has become popular in the treatment of non-variceal UGIB in the past two decades. It can be used as a bleeding control method in case of failed endoscopy or as a method to prevent recurrent bleeding after a successful primary endoscopic therapy. In this study, TAE was used as a preventive tool in patients at high risk of recurrent bleeding after primary endoscopy.

The mean age of patients who underwent preventive TAE was 70.9 ± 12.5 years, which is higher than reported by other authors. Spiliopoulos et al. reported a mean age of 74 years for patients undergoing TAE in their retrospective study. The patient characteristics in the recently reported study by Lau et al. are similar to the results of the present study considering the age and characteristics of the ulcer. In Asian trials, a predominance of male patients is reported; contrary to that, European studies report a proportion of gender similar to our results.

Risk assessment is an indisputable part of the management strategy in patients with acute gastrointestinal bleeding. Even considering the latest progress in endoscopic, surgical, and interventional radiology, there is still a rather high rate of rebleeding — up to 20% — as well as deaths ranging from 5 to 10% particularly in unselected patients. Risk factor identification predicting a high risk of rebleeding is one of the ways for outcome improvement in patients who are poor candidates for surgery. Several criteria have been proposed for the stratification of high- and low-risk patients. The criteria include the physiologic response to bleeding: acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding and a substantial loss of intravascular volume, resting tachycardia, hypotension (systolic blood pressure, < 100 mm Hg), or postural changes (an increase in the pulse rate) and the importance of endoscopic findings (ulcer size and completeness of endoscopic hemostasis). The Glasgow-Blatchford score is widely recommended for the prediction of outcomes and the timing of medical intervention including emergent endoscopy in patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding. The Rockall score is calculated based on the clinical variables indicating the urgency of endoscopic intervention and evidence of stigmata of bleeding. The Glasgow-Blatchford score and the Rockall score are superior considering their sensitivity in predicting the rebleeding rate. Factors like hemoglobin levels, ulcer size, arterial pressure, heart rate, and ASA score were taken into account when making a decision about further therapy after a successful primary endoscopy.

### ACG clinical guideline: upper gastrointestinal and ulcer bleeding [^1139J3py]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

We performed systematic reviews addressing predefined clinical questions to develop recommendations with the GRADE approach regarding management of patients with overt upper gastrointestinal bleeding. We suggest risk assessment in the emergency department to identify very-low-risk patients (e.g. Glasgow-Blatchford score = 0–1) who may be discharged with outpatient follow-up. For patients hospitalized with upper gastrointestinal bleeding, we suggest red blood cell transfusion at a threshold of 7 g/dL. Erythromycin infusion is suggested before endoscopy, and endoscopy is suggested within 24 hours after presentation. Endoscopic therapy is recommended for ulcers with active spurting or oozing and for nonbleeding visible vessels. Endoscopic therapy with bipolar electrocoagulation, heater probe, and absolute ethanol injection is recommended, and low- to very-low-quality evidence also supports clips, argon plasma coagulation, and soft monopolar electrocoagulation; hemostatic powder spray TC-325 is suggested for actively bleeding ulcers and over-the-scope clips for recurrent ulcer bleeding after previous successful hemostasis. After endoscopic hemostasis, high-dose proton pump inhibitor therapy is recommended continuously or intermittently for 3 days, followed by twice-daily oral proton pump inhibitor for the first 2 weeks of therapy after endoscopy. Repeat endoscopy is suggested for recurrent bleeding, and if endoscopic therapy fails, transcatheter embolization is suggested.

### Current management of peptic ulcer bleeding [^112hoFXm]. Nature Clinical Practice: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2006). Medium credibility.

Peptic ulcer bleeding is a common and potentially fatal condition. It is best managed using a multidisciplinary approach by a team with medical, endoscopic and surgical expertise. The management of peptic ulcer bleeding has been revolutionized in the past two decades with the advent of effective endoscopic hemostasis and potent acid-suppressing agents. A prompt initial clinical and endoscopic assessment should allow patients to be triaged effectively into those who require active therapy, versus those who require monitoring and preventative therapy. A combination of pharmacologic and endoscopic therapy (using a combination of injection and thermal coagulation) offers the best chance of hemostasis for those with active bleeding ulcers. Surgery, being the most effective way to control bleeding, should be considered for treatment failures. The choice between surgery and repeat endoscopic therapy should be based on the pre-existing comorbidities of the patient and the characteristics of the ulcer.

### Clinical and endoscopic features of severe acute gastrointestinal bleeding in elderly patients treated with direct oral anticoagulants: a multicentre study [^116APQg6]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In this cohort, severe GI bleeding occurred in a population of elderly patients with multiple and severe cardiovascular comorbidities and moderate to severe renal impairment. With endoscopy performed within 48 h, most of the bleeding events were observed in the upper GI tract, mainly from gastroduodenal peptic ulcers. The need for endoscopic haemostasis was low compared with the initial clinical severity of the bleeding. While the all-cause mortality rate in our cohort was relatively high (11.8% at day 30), only one out of four patients with life-threatening bleeding at admission died within this period. A low haemoglobin level was the only predictive factor for life-threatening bleeding and all-cause mortality. This study represents one of the largest European cohorts of GI bleeding under DOAC therapy and provides information about endoscopic findings and management in those patients. However, considering the lack of studies focusing on GI bleeding and endoscopic management under DOAC therapy, especially in a context of newly available specific antidotes, more real-life studies are needed to better assess these situations.

### ACG clinical guideline: management of patients with acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding [^114CnZMR]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

This guideline provides recommendations for the management of patients with acute overt lower gastrointestinal bleeding. Hemodynamic status should be initially assessed with intravascular volume resuscitation started as needed. Risk stratification based on clinical parameters should be performed to help distinguish patients at high- and low-risk of adverse outcomes. Hematochezia associated with hemodynamic instability may be indicative of an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding source and thus warrants an upper endoscopy. In the majority of patients, colonoscopy should be the initial diagnostic procedure and should be performed within 24h of patient presentation after adequate colon preparation. Endoscopic hemostasis therapy should be provided to patients with high-risk endoscopic stigmata of bleeding including active bleeding, non-bleeding visible vessel, or adherent clot. The endoscopic hemostasis modality used (mechanical, thermal, injection, or combination) is most often guided by the etiology of bleeding, access to the bleeding site, and endoscopist experience with the various hemostasis modalities. Repeat colonoscopy, with endoscopic hemostasis performed if indicated, should be considered for patients with evidence of recurrent bleeding. Radiographic interventions (tagged red blood cell scintigraphy, computed tomographic angiography, and angiography) should be considered in high-risk patients with ongoing bleeding who do not respond adequately to resuscitation and who are unlikely to tolerate bowel preparation and colonoscopy. Strategies to prevent recurrent bleeding should be considered. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use should be avoided in patients with a history of acute lower GI bleeding, particularly if secondary to diverticulosis or angioectasia. Patients with established high-risk cardiovascular disease should not stop aspirin therapy (secondary prophylaxis) in the setting of lower GI bleeding. The exact timing depends on the severity of bleeding, perceived adequacy of hemostasis, and the risk of a thromboembolic event. Surgery for the prevention of recurrent lower gastrointestinal bleeding should be individualized, and the source of bleeding should be carefully localized before resection.

SRH prognostic value and bleeding patterns: SRH provide prognostic information on rebleeding, need for therapeutic intervention, and death and are used to stratify patients and guide management decisions including endoscopic and medical therapy, admission, discharge, and level of care. Most patients with ulcer bleeding have low-risk clean base or flat spot at endoscopy. In a large prospective trial of actively bleeding ulcers, only 68 (17%) of 397 had arterial spurting. In non-randomized cohorts managed conservatively, further bleeding requiring surgery was higher with spurting than with oozing (7/10 (70%) vs. 7/24 (29%)).

### Endoscopic therapy for severe ulcer bleeding [^114wbh9N]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Upper gastrointestinal (UGI) bleeding secondary to ulcer disease occurs commonly and results in significant patient morbidity and medical expense. After initial resuscitation, carefully performed endoscopy provides an accurate diagnosis of the source of the UGI hemorrhage and can reliably identify those high-risk subgroups that may benefit most from endoscopic hemostasis. Effective endoscopic hemostasis of ulcer bleeding can significantly improve outcomes by reducing rebleeding, transfusion requirement, and need for surgery, as well as reduce the cost of medical care. This article discusses the important aspects of the diagnosis and treatment of bleeding from ulcers, with a focus on endoscopic therapy.

ACG Clinical Guideline — recurrent ulcer bleeding after successful endoscopic hemostatic therapy — We suggest that patients with recurrent bleeding after endoscopic therapy for a bleeding ulcer undergo repeat endoscopy and endoscopic therapy rather than undergo surgery or transcatheter arterial embolization (conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence for comparison with surgery; very-low-quality evidence for comparison with transcatheter arterial embolization). In a randomized trial (Endoscopy [N = 48]; Surgery [N = 44]), further bleeding was 11 (22.9) vs 3 (6.8) with absolute difference 16% (2% to 30%); death was 5 (10.4) vs 8 (18.2) with −8% (−22% to 7%); surgery for rebleeding or complication after initial assigned treatment was 13 (27.1) vs 4 (9.1) with 18% (3% to 33%); complications were 7 (14.6) vs 16 (36.4) with −22% (−39% to −4%); and hospital days were median 10 (2–111) vs 11 (4–42). Safety notes include that Two of 48 patients treated with repeat heater probe therapy in the RCT developed perforation, and in that trial failure of repeat endoscopic hemostatic therapy was associated with hypotension at the time of rebleeding and ulcer size > 2 cm.

### Challenges in the management of acute peptic ulcer bleeding [^113UifXL]. Lancet (2013). Excellent credibility.

Acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding is a common medical emergency worldwide, a major cause of which are bleeding peptic ulcers. Endoscopic treatment and acid suppression with proton-pump inhibitors are cornerstones in the management of the disease, and both treatments have been shown to reduce mortality. The role of emergency surgery continues to diminish. In specialised centres, radiological intervention is increasingly used in patients with severe and recurrent bleeding who do not respond to endoscopic treatment. Despite these advances, mortality from the disorder has remained at around 10%. The disease often occurs in elderly patients with frequent comorbidities who use antiplatelet agents, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and anticoagulants. The management of such patients, especially those at high cardiothrombotic risk who are on anticoagulants, is a challenge for clinicians. We summarise the published scientific literature about the management of patients with bleeding peptic ulcers, identify directions for future clinical research, and suggest how mortality can be reduced.

### ACG clinical guideline: upper gastrointestinal and ulcer bleeding [^112qEc3x]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

ACG Clinical Guideline — overt upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) management summarizes key acute care recommendations as follows: We suggest risk assessment in the emergency department to identify very-low-risk patients (e.g. Glasgow-Blatchford score = 0–1) who may be discharged with outpatient follow-up. For patients hospitalized with upper gastrointestinal bleeding, we suggest red blood cell transfusion at a threshold of 7 g/dL. Erythromycin infusion is suggested before endoscopy, and endoscopy is suggested within 24 hours after presentation. Endoscopic therapy is recommended for ulcers with active spurting or oozing and for nonbleeding visible vessels, and endoscopic therapy with bipolar electrocoagulation, heater probe, and absolute ethanol injection is recommended; low- to very-low-quality evidence also supports clips, argon plasma coagulation, and soft monopolar electrocoagulation. Hemostatic powder spray TC-325 is suggested for actively bleeding ulcers and over-the-scope clips for recurrent ulcer bleeding after previous successful hemostasis. After endoscopic hemostasis, high-dose proton pump inhibitor therapy is recommended continuously or intermittently for 3 days, followed by twice-daily oral proton pump inhibitor for the first 2 weeks of therapy after endoscopy. Repeat endoscopy is suggested for recurrent bleeding, and if endoscopic therapy fails, transcatheter embolization is suggested.

### Management of patients with ulcer bleeding [^116AF6K7]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2012). Medium credibility.

ACG Practice Guidelines — Management of patients with ulcer bleeding — outline step-wise care for overt upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) from assessment through prevention. Hemodynamic status is first assessed, and patients are risk-stratified. Pre-endoscopic erythromycin is considered to increase diagnostic yield at first endoscopy, and pre-endoscopic proton pump inhibitor (PPI) may be considered to decrease the need for endoscopic therapy but does not improve clinical outcomes. Upper endoscopy is generally performed within 24 h, and ulcer stigmata direct therapy. Patients with active bleeding or non-bleeding visible vessels receive endoscopic therapy and those with an adherent clot may receive endoscopic therapy; these patients then receive intravenous PPI with a bolus followed by continuous infusion, whereas patients with flat spots or clean-based ulcers do not require endoscopic therapy or intensive PPI therapy. Recurrent bleeding after endoscopic therapy is treated with a second endoscopic treatment; if bleeding persists or recurs, surgery or interventional radiology is undertaken. For prevention, H. pylori is eradicated and after cure is documented anti-ulcer therapy is generally not given; nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are stopped, and if they must be resumed low-dose COX-2-selective NSAID plus PPI is used; patients with established cardiovascular disease who require aspirin should start PPI and generally re-institute aspirin soon after bleeding ceases (within 7 days and ideally 1–3 days); patients with idiopathic ulcers receive long-term anti-ulcer therapy.

### Consensus recommendations for managing patients with nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^117Fzesk]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Background

The management of patients with acute nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding has evolved substantially over the past 10 years amid a paucity of published consensus guidelines.

Purpose

To provide evidence-based management recommendations that address clinically relevant issues. REVIEW AND CONSENSUS PROCESSES: A multidisciplinary consensus group of 25 voting participants representing 11 national societies used a 7-step approach to develop recommendation statements according to accepted standards. Sources of data included narrative and systematic reviews as well as published and new meta-analyses. The quality of the evidence, the strength of the recommendation, and the level of consensus were graded according to recognized classifications.

Main Findings

Recommendations emphasize appropriate initial resuscitation of the patient and a multidisciplinary approach to clinical risk stratification that determines the need for early endoscopy. Early endoscopy allows safe and prompt discharge of selected patients classified as low risk. Endoscopic hemostasis is reserved for patients with high-risk endoscopic lesions. Although monotherapy with injection or thermal coagulation is effective, the combination is superior to either treatment alone. The placement of endoscopic clips for endoscopic hemostasis appears promising. High-dose intravenous proton-pump inhibition is recommended in patients who have undergone successful endoscopic therapy. Routine second-look endoscopy is not recommended. Patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding should be tested for Helicobacter pylori infection and receive eradication therapy if infection is present.

Future Directions

The efficacy of newer endoscopic therapeutic technologies, the optimal regimen of proton-pump inhibition, and the roles of other pharmacologic agents require further research.

### Management of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in children: variceal and nonvariceal [^111LpSYc]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Upper gastrointestinal (UGI) bleeding is generally defined as bleeding proximal to the ligament of Treitz, which leads to hematemesis. There are several causes of UGI bleeding necessitating a detailed history to rule out comorbid conditions, medications, and possible exposures. In addition, the severity, timing, duration, and volume of the bleeding are important details to note for management purposes. Despite the source of the bleeding, acid suppression with a proton-pump inhibitor has been shown to be effective in minimizing rebleeding. Endoscopy remains the interventional modality of choice for both nonvariceal and variceal bleeds because it can be diagnostic and therapeutic.

Acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding — non-colonoscopy interventions: A surgical consultation should be requested in patients with high-risk clinical features and ongoing bleeding, and surgery for acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding should be considered after other therapeutic options have failed with careful localization of the source whenever possible (conditional recommendation, very-low-quality evidence). Radiographic interventions should be considered in patients with high-risk clinical features and ongoing bleeding who have a negative upper endoscopy and do not respond adequately to hemodynamic resuscitation and are unlikely to tolerate bowel preparation and urgent colonoscopy (strong recommendation, very-low-quality evidence). If a diagnostic test is desired for localization of the bleeding site before angiography, computed tomographic angiography should be considered (conditional recommendation, very-low-quality evidence).

### ACG clinical guideline: management of patients with acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding [^114G3vn8]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016). Medium credibility.

ACG acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding management — hemodynamic status should be initially assessed with intravascular volume resuscitation started as needed, and risk stratification based on clinical parameters should be performed to help distinguish patients at high- and low-risk of adverse outcomes. Hematochezia associated with hemodynamic instability may be indicative of an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding source and thus warrants an upper endoscopy. In the majority of patients, colonoscopy should be the initial diagnostic procedure and should be performed within 24 h of patient presentation after adequate colon preparation, and endoscopic hemostasis therapy should be provided to patients with high-risk endoscopic stigmata of bleeding including active bleeding, non-bleeding visible vessel, or adherent clot. The endoscopic hemostasis modality used (mechanical, thermal, injection, or combination) is most often guided by endoscopist experience, the etiology of bleeding, access to the bleeding site, and endoscopist experience with the various hemostasis modalities, and repeat colonoscopy, with endoscopic hemostasis performed if indicated, should be considered for patients with evidence of recurrent bleeding. Radiographic interventions (tagged red blood cell scintigraphy, computed tomographic angiography, and angiography) should be considered in high-risk patients with ongoing bleeding who do not respond adequately to resuscitation and who are unlikely to tolerate bowel preparation and colonoscopy, and strategies to prevent recurrent bleeding should be considered. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use should be avoided in patients with a history of acute lower GI bleeding, particularly if secondary to diverticulosis or angioectasia, and patients with established cardiovascular disease who require aspirin (secondary prophylaxis) should generally resume aspirin as soon as possible after bleeding ceases and at least within 7 days. Surgery for the prevention of recurrent lower gastrointestinal bleeding should be individualized, and the source of bleeding should be carefully localized before resection.

### Prophylactic transcatheter arterial embolization for high-risk ulcers following endoscopic hemostasis: a meta-analysis [^116F5ETU]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) is widely acknowledged for its effectiveness in treating brisk arterial bleeding. It has largely replaced surgery as a first-line therapy for UGIB refractory to endoscopic treatment due to its high efficacy and favorable safety profile. However, a subgroup of ulcers remains at high risk for future rebleeding despite achieving hemostasis via endoscopy. These high-risk lesions are typically large in size (i.e.g.reater than 10mm), belong to Forrest class I-IIb, and/or were treated in hemodynamically unstable patients. While residual blood flow underneath a treated lesion may serve as a source of rebleeding, the intermittent nature of UGIB is dependent on a patient's hemodynamic status. For example, a hypotensive patient may present with a lesion that appeared hemostatic at endoscopy; however following blood transfusion, the normalized blood pressure could initiate rebleeding. In 2012, based on the available data at that time, the American College of Gastroenterology Guidelines only recommended medical treatment of the underlying etiology such as withholding aspirin, treating H. pylori, etc. Studies have been published in the last 5 years showing the use of PTAE to decrease this risk and mortality in selected patients. As such, most authors considered PTAE as an option if the ulcer was deemed high risk based on endoscopic findings (i.e. large ulcers, Forrest class I-IIb) and/or clinical presentation (i.e. hypotension, decreased hemoglobin during endoscopy). Mille et al. considered PTAE in patients with Forrest class I-IIc ulcers based on the presence of clinical and individual risk factors. Twenty-seven patients from the Mille et al. study were evaluated to be Forrest class III; however, none received PTAE and were instead treated with proton pump inhibitors and/or EO.

### Perforated and bleeding peptic ulcer: WSES guidelines [^117SS96m]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

An immediate or delayed biopsy is recommended (weak recommendation based on low-quality evidences, 2C)

A refractory bleeding peptic ulcer is defined as an ulcer still bleeding after repeated endoscopy/angioembolization. Open surgery is recommended when endoscopic treatments have failed and there is evidence of ongoing bleeding, plus or minus hemodynamic instability. The choice of the appropriate surgical procedure for bleeding peptic ulcer should be made on the basis of the location and extension of the ulcer and the characteristics of the bleeding vessel. Surgical approach involves ulcer oversew or resection. Bleeding gastric ulcers should be resected or at least biopsied for the possibility of neoplasms. Conversely, most duodenal ulcers requiring surgery for persistent bleeding are usually large and posterior lesions, and the bleeding is often from the gastro-duodenal artery. A recent prospective cohort study conducted in Denmark compared the outcomes of duodenal and gastric bleeding peptic ulcers and found a significantly higher 90-day mortality and reoperation rate for the duodenal location, confirming the greater complexity of surgical management of this ulcer. Via duodenotomy, the bleeding vessel can be seen on the floor of the ulcer and can be rapidly oversewn. It is critical to perform triple-loop suturing of bleeding of the GDA due to the collateral blood supply to the transverse pancreatic arteries. The surgeon may not know preoperatively where the bleeding originates and intraoperative endoscopic guidance may be helpful. For patients with intractable ulcer bleeding, Schroeder et al. from the analysis of a large database (ACS-NSQIP) have found that the surgical procedure of vagotomy/drainage is associated with significantly lower mortality than simply simple local ulcer oversew. They further suggest that vagotomy/drainage is preferred to local procedures alone for the surgical management of patients with bleeding peptic ulcer disease requiring emergency operation for intractable bleeding ulcers.

In patients with bleeding peptic ulcer, what is the role of damage control surgery?

We suggest considering damage control surgery for patients with hemorrhagic shock and signs of severe physiological derangement, in order to quickly resolve the bleeding and allow a prompt ICU admission (weak recommendation based on very low-quality evidences, 2D).

Indications for damage control surgery in bleeding peptic ulcer are similar to those for perforated peptic ulcer and are reported in the WSES guidelines on Open Abdomen management in non-trauma patients.

### Management of complicated peptic ulcer disease… [^112Ce6t7]. JAMA Network (2005). Excellent credibility.

Lester Dragstedt, MD, PhD, reported on the importance of pyloroplasty as an adjunct to vagotomy to prevent gastric stasis. Further, he noted that the release of gastrin was due in part to an elevated gastric pH. He proposed that vagotomy combined with antrectomy was a superior operation for peptic ulcer disease owing to its eradication of the cephalic and gastric influences on acid secretion. Several recommendations for treatment among those with NSAID-associated peptic ulceration can be made. All anti-inflammatory and antiplatelet drug treatments should be withdrawn. Any long-term anticoagulation should be temporarily reversed. Assessment and treatment of HP infection, if present, seems reasonable. If further anti-inflammatory drugs are to be used, consideration for cyclooxygenase inhibitor–specific therapy should be entertained. 30 Data relative to any impact of NSAID use in the treatment algorithm for complicated ulcer disease will be discussed further.

The diagnosis was made via upper endoscopy and biopsy performed at the time of laparotomy. Postoperatively, patients were randomized to receive anti-HP therapy or a 4-week course of omeprazole alone after which treatment with all medications was discontinued. Patients completing the study protocol were followed up for 1 year with repeat endoscopy for ulcer surveillance and HP infection assessment by repeat biopsy. In those with a successful second endoscopy, complications occurred in 14%. In contrast, 93% of patients going directly to surgery without repeat endoscopy achieved permanent hemostasis with a postoperative complication rate of 36%. On analysis, the authors noted that hypotension prior to the second endoscopy and an ulcer larger than 2 cm significantly correlated with endoscopic failure.

With the recognition that HP infection significantly contributes to the etiology and persistence of uncomplicated ulcer disease, its role in the treatment algorithm for patients with significant gastrointestinal tract bleeding was questioned. Specifically, can therapy directed at HP infection eradication complement therapeutic endoscopy and reduce the number of patients requiring operation for hemorrhage. The question remains: Can early treatment for HP infection, if present, avert surgery in those with massive bleeding. In 2 similarly designed and consecutively reported early studies, Rokkas et al66 and Jaspersen et al67 examined the impact of HP eradication in those patients with upper gastrointestinal tract bleeding secondary to peptic ulcer disease. The presence of HP infection in both studies was assessed by both the CLO test and histologic evaluation.

### Upper gastrointestinal bleeding in adults: evaluation and… [^112hNsBz]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

Treatments ENDOSCOPY Patients with hemodynamic instability and signs of upper GI bleeding should be offered urgent endoscopy after fluid resuscitation and stabilization. 30 The majority of efficacy data on endoscopic therapy is from trials including individuals who have peptic ulcer bleeding. The recommended endoscopic methods for peptic ulcer bleeding include injection of epinephrine, injection of other sclerosants, bipolar electrocoagulation probes, heater probes, or endoclips. 3 Endoscopic injection of epinephrine should not be used as monotherapy in patients with peptic ulcer bleeding because it has higher rates of failure than epinephrine injection combined with another modality.
31. ARTERIAL EMBOLIZATION AND SURGERY Transcatheter arterial embolization is typically performed after endoscopy if endoscopy has failed to control bleeding.

A common strategy in patients with failed endoscopic hemostasis is to attempt transcatheter arterial embolization, then proceed to surgery if hemostasis is not obtained. However, a systematic review of nine studies including 711 individuals found that surgery was associated with a 59% lower risk of rebleeding compared with transcatheter arterial embolization with no difference in mortality.
32. PROTON PUMP INHIBITORS Proton pump inhibitors should be started upon presentation with upper GI bleeding. 33 Initiation of a proton pump inhibitor should not be delayed before endoscopy. Oral proton pump inhibitors may be preferred over intravenous ones because of cost savings when used in conjunction with endoscopic treatment. 34 A 2017 meta-analysis of nine RCTs showed no difference between oral and intravenous proton pump inhibitors in recurrent bleeding, surgery, or mortality. 34 Guidelines recommend high-dose proton pump inhibitor treatment for the first 72 hours post-endoscopy because this is when rebleeding risk is highest. 5 After 72 hours of high-dose therapy, patients with high-risk endoscopic lesions should receive twice-daily proton pump inhibitors through day 14, whereas those with low-risk lesions require only once-daily proton pump inhibitor therapy. Once-daily proton pump inhibitor therapy should be continued for four to eight weeks in patients with peptic ulcer bleeding. In patients with peptic ulcer bleeding, the benefits of proton pump inhibitor therapy outweigh the risks. 3.

Arch Surg. 1999; 134: 1373–1377. doi: 10.1001/archsurg.134.12.1373 WHILE ulcerations of the stomach and duodenum remained common entities in the latter half of the 20th century, the number of operations performed for ulcer declined remarkably. Medical treatments became effective as specific medications eliminated the deleterious effects of intraluminal acid, greatly reducing the need for operations. 1 Subsequently, bacterial infection was proven to be a major risk factor for gastric and duodenal ulcers., especially for ulcer recurrence, which was eliminated in 98% of those at risk by antibiotics directed against Helicobacter species.

2, 3 For the first time in history, medical treatments for ulcer were clearly more effective than ulcer operations; ulcer surgery, once the only "definitive" therapy, is perceived as a heroic intervention, reserved for patients without other alternatives.
