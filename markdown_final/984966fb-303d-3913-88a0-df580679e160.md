## Question

Antibiotic for nasal infection

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about when and how to use antibiotics for a "nasal infection", which in clinical practice spans viral rhinitis, acute bacterial rhinosinusitis, and chronic rhinosinusitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the clinical entity and distinguishing viral from bacterial disease. Then, I should verify the diagnostic criteria that justify antibiotics in acute bacterial rhinosinusitis. Next, I will review first-line antibiotic choices, dosing, and duration, including special populations and allergy considerations. After that, I need to check what to do if there is no improvement and how to escalate. Finally, I will consider chronic rhinosinusitis, where antibiotics are generally not indicated, and close with stewardship and patient counseling points.

> Let me first confirm the terminology so I don't conflate entities. "Nasal infection" in primary care typically refers to acute rhinosinusitis, which is classified as viral or bacterial based on duration and trajectory of symptoms; chronic rhinosinusitis is a separate inflammatory condition lasting beyond 12 weeks and is not managed with routine antibiotics in the absence of an acute bacterial exacerbation [^e3747a0e] [^5600ca63].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about antibiotics for everyone with nasal symptoms. I need to ensure I distinguish viral from bacterial disease because most acute rhinosinusitis is viral and antibiotics do not help; watchful waiting and supportive care are appropriate, and antibiotics should be reserved for patients who meet specific bacterial criteria or are severely ill [^f7f6a5e8] [^e58e7a35].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic criteria for acute bacterial rhinosinusitis. I should confirm that ABRS is suspected when symptoms persist for at least 10 days without improvement, or worsen after initial improvement ("double sickening"), or are severe at onset with fever of 39°C or higher plus purulent nasal discharge and facial pain for at least 3 consecutive days; these are the standard adult criteria endorsed by contemporary guidelines and reviews [^5600ca63] [^e58e7a35] [^3b365ed9].

> Wait, let me verify the strength of evidence before recommending antibiotics even when criteria are met. High-quality evidence shows only modest benefit from antibiotics in uncomplicated ABRS, with a small reduction in clinical failure and faster resolution of purulent discharge, but a meaningful increase in adverse effects; thus, shared decision-making is important, and observation without antibiotics is reasonable in selected adults with mild disease and reliable follow-up [^f7f6a5e8] [^688a248f] [^85b082f7].

> I will now examine first-line therapy for adults who warrant antibiotics. I should confirm that amoxicillin is preferred for most adults with uncomplicated ABRS, with amoxicillin–clavulanate reserved for those with risk factors for resistance, moderate to severe disease, recent antibiotics, daycare exposure, older age, or comorbidities; duration is typically 5–7 days, shorter courses being effective and associated with fewer adverse effects [^e674ee33] [^46755339] [^5044ac90].

> But wait, what if the patient has a penicillin allergy. I need to check alternatives: doxycycline is a reasonable option for adults with nonsevere beta-lactam allergy, while respiratory fluoroquinolones are reserved for patients with severe beta-lactam allergy or when first-line therapy fails; macrolides should be avoided for empiric therapy due to high resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae, and TMP-SMX is not recommended because of resistance patterns [^991b5309] [^5be9c73f] [^56b5e946].

> Next, I should review pediatric considerations. Let me verify that amoxicillin–clavulanate is first-line in children when antibiotics are indicated, with dosing at 90 mg/kg/day of the amoxicillin component plus 6.4 mg/kg/day of clavulanate; observation without immediate antibiotics is acceptable for persistent symptoms, and antibiotics are indicated for severe onset or worsening course as defined by pediatric criteria [^1f445561] [^9c1a586c] [^fb734ce7].

> I need to ensure I plan for treatment failure. If there is no improvement after 3–5 days of appropriate therapy, I should reassess the diagnosis, consider complications, and switch therapy; common issues include beta-lactamase–producing Haemophilus influenzae or Moraxella catarrhalis and penicillin-resistant pneumococcus, prompting escalation to high-dose amoxicillin–clavulanate or a respiratory fluoroquinolone if no alternatives exist, with careful attention to adverse effects and stewardship [^c61db5e6] [^c02e2d71] [^7fa8adcc].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of diagnostics when patients fail therapy. Cultures by direct sinus aspiration are not routine but may be considered in refractory cases or when complications are suspected; in practice, many clinicians rely on clinical reassessment and, when needed, imaging to evaluate for complications or alternative diagnoses rather than routine culture [^511da4a7] [^a743ebd8].

> Let me consider chronic rhinosinusitis separately, because I need to avoid reflex antibiotics. Routine antibiotics are not indicated for CRS without an acute bacterial exacerbation; first-line management is intranasal corticosteroids and saline irrigation, with antibiotics reserved for documented acute bacterial exacerbations characterized by significant or persistent purulent discharge and objective evidence of infection, ideally confirmed on exam or endoscopy [^4912c1a7] [^862326b1] [^852e175d].

> I should double-check the evidence base for antibiotics in CRS. Systematic reviews show very limited benefit from systemic antibiotics in CRS, with only modest, short-term quality-of-life improvements in select subgroups and no durable long-term benefit; macrolides may have anti-inflammatory effects but data are mixed, reinforcing that antibiotics should not be used routinely for CRS [^ab3ebe00] [^8c98907a].

> Next, I should review stewardship and patient counseling so we do not overprescribe. Most acute rhinosinusitis is viral and improves within 7–10 days; antibiotics increase adverse effects without meaningful benefit in uncomplicated cases, and overuse drives resistance; patients should be educated about red flags that warrant reassessment and the risks of unnecessary antibiotics, aligning with high-value care recommendations [^f7f6a5e8] [^2001cd74] [^923938c0].

> In summary, I need to ensure antibiotics are used only when ABRS criteria are met or when illness is severe, favor amoxicillin for most adults (amoxicillin–clavulanate when risk factors are present), keep courses short, and reassess promptly if there is no improvement; for CRS, avoid routine antibiotics and prioritize intranasal steroids and saline, reserving antibiotics for documented acute bacterial exacerbations [^e674ee33] [^4912c1a7] [^f7f6a5e8].

Antibiotics are **not routinely indicated** for nasal infections because most are viral and self-limited [^f7f6a5e8]. Reserve antibiotics for **acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS)** [^e674ee33] when symptoms persist ≥ 10 days without improvement, worsen after initial improvement ("double sickening"), or are severe (fever ≥ 39°C with purulent discharge/facial pain ≥ 3 days) [^3b365ed9]. First-line therapy is **amoxicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanate for 5–7 days** [^e674ee33]; use amoxicillin-clavulanate if there are risk factors for resistance or severe disease [^5044ac90]. Avoid antibiotics for chronic rhinosinusitis without acute bacterial exacerbation [^4912c1a7] [^862326b1]. If no improvement in 3–5 days, reassess and consider alternative diagnoses or different antibiotics [^c61db5e6] [^7fa8adcc].

## Indications for antibiotic therapy in nasal infections

Antibiotics are **not indicated for most nasal infections**, as they are typically viral and self-limited [^f7f6a5e8]. However, antibiotics are indicated for **acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS)** [^e674ee33] under the following clinical scenarios:

- **Persistent symptoms**: Nasal discharge or cough lasting ≥ 10 days without improvement [^3b365ed9].
- **Worsening symptoms**: New-onset fever, increased nasal discharge, or cough after initial improvement ("double sickening") [^3b365ed9].
- **Severe onset**: Fever ≥ 39°C (102.2°F) with purulent nasal discharge and facial pain for ≥ 3 consecutive days [^3b365ed9].

---

## First-line antibiotic recommendations

When antibiotics are indicated for ABRS, the following **first-line agents are recommended**:

| **Antibiotic** | **Dosage and duration** | **Indications** |
|-|-|-|
| Amoxicillin | 500 mg orally three times daily or 875 mg orally twice daily for 5–7 days | - First-line for uncomplicated ABRS [^e674ee33] <br/> - Narrow spectrum <br/> - Lower adverse-event rate [^46755339] |
| Amoxicillin-clavulanate | 500/125 mg orally three times daily or 875/125 mg orally twice daily for 5–7 days | - Risk factors for resistance [^5044ac90] <br/> - Severe infection [^68047c96] <br/> - Recent antibiotic use <br/> - Immunocompromised patients [^68047c96] |

---

## Alternative antibiotic therapy

For patients with **beta-lactam allergy** or intolerance, the following alternatives are recommended:

- **Doxycycline**: 100 mg orally twice daily for 5–7 days [^notfound].
- **Respiratory fluoroquinolones (levofloxacin, moxifloxacin)**: Reserved for patients with severe beta-lactam allergy or treatment failure [^c02e2d71].

---

## Antibiotics not recommended

Certain antibiotics are **not recommended** due to resistance patterns or limited efficacy:

- **Macrolides (azithromycin, clarithromycin)**: High resistance rates in Streptococcus pneumoniae [^5be9c73f].
- **Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole**: High resistance rates and limited efficacy [^56b5e946].
- **Second- or third-generation oral cephalosporins**: Inadequate coverage for common pathogens [^98dd0b32].

---

## Duration of antibiotic therapy

The **recommended duration** of antibiotic therapy for ABRS is 5–7 days [^e674ee33]. Shorter courses (5 days) are effective and associated with fewer adverse effects than longer courses [^a9f44057].

---

## Management of treatment failure

If there is no improvement within 3–5 days of antibiotic therapy, clinicians should **reassess the diagnosis** and consider the following:

- **Confirm ABRS**: Re-evaluate symptoms and signs [^c61db5e6].
- **Exclude other causes**: Consider alternative diagnoses (e.g. allergic rhinitis, migraine, dental infections) [^c61db5e6].
- **Change antibiotic**: Switch to a different antibiotic class or broaden coverage if resistance is suspected [^c02e2d71].
- **Imaging**: Consider sinus CT if complications are suspected or if symptoms persist despite appropriate therapy [^1d7920a8].

---

## Special considerations

- **Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS)**: Antibiotics are not routinely indicated unless there is an acute bacterial exacerbation [^4912c1a7] [^862326b1].
- **Pediatric patients**: Amoxicillin-clavulanate is first-line therapy, with dosing adjusted for age and weight [^1f445561] [^fb734ce7].
- **Immunocompromised patients**: Broad-spectrum antibiotics may be necessary, and specialist consultation is advised [^68047c96].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Antibiotics are **not routinely indicated** for nasal infections, as most are viral and self-limited [^f7f6a5e8]. They should be reserved for confirmed ABRS based on clinical criteria [^3b365ed9]. First-line therapy is **amoxicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanate for 5–7 days** [^e674ee33], with alternatives for beta-lactam allergy [^991b5309]. If there is no improvement within 3–5 days, reassess the diagnosis and consider alternative antibiotics or further evaluation [^c61db5e6].

### Is there a role for antibiotics in the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis? [^ce066305]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

Rhinosinusitis is one of the most common reasons for adult outpatient antibiotic prescriptions, though there is little clinical evidence to support this practice, especially for chronic rhinosinusitis. Despite considerable research, the etiology of chronic rhinosinusitis, including the pathogenic role of microbes, remains poorly understood. Rigorous studies of the efficacy of antibiotic treatment of chronic sinusitis are surprisingly few in number and the results are somewhat conflicting. This article will review the rationales for and against the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis with antibiotics, based on current evidence and understanding of pathophysiology, and will also summarize the current guidelines.

### Antibiotics for acute rhinosinusitis in adults [^f7f6a5e8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Acute rhinosinusitis is an acute infection of the nasal passages and paranasal sinuses that lasts less than four weeks. Diagnosis of acute rhinosinusitis is generally based on clinical signs and symptoms in ambulatory care settings. Technical investigations are not routinely performed, nor are they recommended in most countries. Some trials show a trend in favour of antibiotics, but the balance of benefit versus harm is unclear. We merged two Cochrane Reviews for this update, which comprised different approaches with overlapping populations, resulting in different conclusions. For this review update, we maintained the distinction between populations diagnosed by clinical signs and symptoms, or imaging.

Objectives

To assess the effects of antibiotics versus placebo or no treatment in adults with acute rhinosinusitis in ambulatory care settings.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (2017, Issue 12), which contains the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE (January 1950 to January 2018), Embase (January 1974 to January 2018), and two trials registers (January 2018). We also checked references from identified trials, systematic reviews, and relevant guidelines.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of antibiotics versus placebo or no treatment in people with rhinosinusitis-like signs or symptoms or sinusitis confirmed by imaging.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data about cure and side effects and assessed the risk of bias. We contacted trial authors for additional information as required.

Main Results

We included 15 trials involving 3057 participants. Of the 15 included trials, 10 appeared in our 2012 review, and five (631 participants) are legacy trials from merging two reviews. No new studies were included from searches for this update. Overall, risk of bias was low. Without antibiotics, 46% of participants with rhinosinusitis, whether or not confirmed by radiography, were cured after 1 week and 64% after 14 days. Antibiotics can shorten time to cure, but only 5 to 11 more people per 100 will be cured faster if they receive antibiotics instead of placebo or no treatment: clinical diagnosis (odds ratio (OR) 1.25, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02 to 1.54; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 19, 95% CI 10 to 205; I² = 0%; 8 trials; high-quality evidence) and diagnosis confirmed by radiography (OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.39; NNTB 10, 95% CI 5 to 136; I² = 0%; 3 trials; moderate-quality evidence). Cure rates with antibiotics were higher when a fluid level or total opacification in any sinus was found on computed tomography (OR 4.89, 95% CI 1.75 to 13.72; NNTB 4, 95% CI 2 to 15; 1 trial; moderate-quality evidence). Purulent secretion resolved faster with antibiotics (OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.13 to 2.22; NNTB 10, 95% CI 6 to 35; I² = 0%; 3 trials; high-quality evidence). However, 13 more people experienced side effects with antibiotics compared to placebo or no treatment (OR 2.21, 95% CI 1.74 to 2.82; number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) 8, 95% CI 6 to 12; I² = 16%; 10 trials; high-quality evidence). Five fewer people per 100 will experience clinical failure if they receive antibiotics instead of placebo or no treatment (Peto OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.63; NNTH 19, 95% CI 15 to 27; I² = 21%; 12 trials; high-quality evidence). A disease-related complication (brain abscess) occurred in one participant (of 3057) one week after receiving open antibiotic therapy (clinical failure, control group).

Authors' Conclusions

The potential benefit of antibiotics to treat acute rhinosinusitis diagnosed either clinically (low risk of bias, high-quality evidence) or confirmed by imaging (low to unclear risk of bias, moderate-quality evidence) is marginal and needs to be seen in the context of the risk of adverse effects. Considering antibiotic resistance, and the very low incidence of serious complications, we conclude there is no place for antibiotics for people with uncomplicated acute rhinosinusitis. We could not draw conclusions about children, people with suppressed immune systems, and those with severe sinusitis, because these populations were not included in the available trials.

### Accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis: minimizing bacterial resistance [^4305796e]. Clinical Therapeutics (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Antimicrobial resistance in respiratory pathogens has become a common clinical problem that has serious public health implications. Inappropriate use of antibiotics for the treatment of viral upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) has contributed to the development of resistant microorganisms. Health care providers can help control the spread of resistance by limiting the use of antimicrobial agents to infections that meet clinical guidelines for a bacterial cause.

Objective

This article examines the means of accurately diagnosing and appropriately treating acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) in an effort to control increasing levels of resistance.

Methods

This article discusses current treatment guidelines that provide the evidenced-based rationale for choosing the most appropriate antimicrobial agents for suspected ABRS in adults and children. An evidence-based approach can help minimize the public health threat posed by the continuing increase in microbial resistance.

Results

Although definitive clinical criteria that differentiate between ABRS and viral URTI are lacking, careful evaluation of the duration and severity of symptoms provides a rational basis for diagnosing ABRS in primary care settings.

Conclusions

Once a diagnosis of ABRS has been made, empiric antibiotic therapy may be justified. When it is, the first-line agent should be the narrowest spectrum antibiotic that would be expected to eradicate the most common causative organisms. The antibiotic selection process should take into account prevailing patterns of resistance and the presence of risk factors for infection with resistant pathogens, as well as published evidence-based guidelines.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^e674ee33]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) in most adults — initial antibiotic and duration: If a decision is made to treat ABRS with an antibiotic agent, the clinician should prescribe amoxicillin with or without clavulanate as first-line therapy for 5–7 days for most adults. This is a Recommendation based on randomized controlled trials with heterogeneity and noninferiority design, with Aggregate evidence quality: Grade A and Level of Confidence in Evidence: Moderate. Benefits-harms assessment indicates a preponderance of benefit over harm, while risks include potential increased gastrointestinal adverse effects with amoxicillin-clavulanate and adverse effects from penicillin allergy. Exceptions include patients with penicillin allergy for whom amoxicillin is contraindicated. Intentional vagueness states that whether to prescribe amoxicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanate is at the clinician's discretion and that "most" adults are recommended 5 days of therapy, although a longer course may be appropriate for more severe illness or persistent symptoms beyond the initial 5 days. Role of patient preferences is moderate for shared decision making and large for determining duration since adverse events are reduced with shorter duration of therapy.

### Guidelines for the use of antibiotics in acute upper respiratory tract infections [^fe5b6f95]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

To help physicians with the appropriate use of antibiotics in children and adults with upper respiratory tract infection, a multidisciplinary team evaluated existing guidelines and summarized key practice points. Acute otitis media in children should be diagnosed only if there is abrupt onset, signs of middle ear effusion, and symptoms of inflammation. A period of observation without immediate use of antibiotics is an option for certain children. In patients with sinus infection, acute bacterial rhinosinusitis should be diagnosed and treated with antibiotics only if symptoms have not improved after 10 days or have worsened after five to seven days. In patients with sore throat, a diagnosis of group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus pharyngitis generally requires confirmation with rapid antigen testing, although other guidelines allow for empiric therapy if a validated clinical rule suggests a high likelihood of infection. Acute bronchitis in otherwise healthy adults should not be treated with antibiotics; delayed prescriptions may help ease patient fears and simultaneously reduce inappropriate use of antibiotics.

### Principles of appropriate antibiotic use for treatment of nonspecific upper respiratory tract infections in adults: background [^efe8f51f]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The following principles of appropriate antibiotic use for adults with nonspecific upper respiratory tract infections apply to immunocompetent adults without complicating comorbid conditions, such as chronic lung or heart disease.1. The diagnosis of nonspecific upper respiratory tract infection or acute rhinopharyngitis should be used to denote an acute infection that is typically viral in origin and in which sinus, pharyngeal, and lower airway symptoms, although frequently present, are not prominent. 2. Antibiotic treatment of adults with nonspecific upper respiratory tract infection does not enhance illness resolution and is not recommended. Studies specifically testing the impact of antibiotic treatment on complications of nonspecific upper respiratory tract infections have not been performed in adults. Life-threatening complications of upper respiratory tract infection are rare.3. Purulent secretions from the nares or throat (commonly observed in patients with uncomplicated upper respiratory tract infection) predict neither bacterial infection nor benefit from antibiotic treatment.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS AND CONCLUDING REMARKS

Some unanswered questions in CRS antibiotic research are listed in Table II. Several expert guidelines call for RCTs to study the widespread practice of antibiotics for CRS. 3,72 Due to the variable quality of much of the existing evidence, it remains uncertain whether the use of short or long-term antibiotics have an impact on patient outcomes in adults with CRS. Further randomised studies with larger population sizes are needed. Unlike macrolides, the combination of amoxicillin and clavulanate is not believed to have direct sinonasal anti-inflammatory properties, and so studies are needed to determine conclusively its effectiveness in CRS given the frequency of its prescription for CRS.

Antibiotic resistance is a major threat to public health that demands ongoing attention. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that more than 2 million patients suffer from complications of antibiotic resistance, with 23,000 patients dying from such complications annually in the United States. 73 Furthermore, the CDC estimates that at least 1 in 3 prescriptions for antibiotics are unnecessary, and the majority of the unnecessary antibiotics are prescribed for respiratory disease caused by viruses. 73 Reducing inappropriate antibiotic use is critical to combating antibiotic resistance. CRS is an ideal condition to clarify the appropriateness and efficacy of antibiotic prescriptions, which is very pertinent in the context of the global crisis of resistance to antibiotics. 3

### Is there a role for antibiotics in the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis? [^4a04e655]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

If acute and chronic cases are combined, rhinosinusitis (RS) is currently the most common indication for adult outpatient antibiotic prescriptions in the United States. There are several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses demonstrating no evidence of benefit from antibiotics for the common cold/acute RS (ARS). and some evidence supporting the efficacy of antibiotics in the treatment of a select group of patients with symptoms and signs suggestive of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS), However, there are only two published placebo-controlled randomized trials of antibiotic efficacy for chronic RS (CRS), defined as RS symptoms lasting > 12 weeks. Guidelines differ regarding whether antibiotics should be included as part of the regimen for medical therapy for CRS, which reflects both the paucity of rigorous and consistent evidence supporting their efficacy and the persisting uncertainty about the role of microbes in the pathogenesis of CRS. This article will review the rationale for and against antibiotic treatment of CRS based on available clinical evidence as well as the current understanding of the pathophysiology of this condition. We will focus primarily on diffuse primary CRS in adults but antibiotic recommendations for some special considerations will be discussed also. The review will not cover the role of antifungals in the treatment of fungal sinusitis.

CRS encompasses a complex, heterogeneous group of debilitating chronic inflammatory sinonasal diseases. The changing of treatment recommendations over time reflects the evolving understanding of the pathogenesis of the various phenotypes and endotypes. Despite being the subject of considerable research, the etiology of CRS remains poorly understood. A wide range of potential causative agents have been investigated: microbes, aberrant inflammatory patterns, anatomic variations, the genetics underlying the innate immune system and epithelial barrier integrity and mucociliary clearance, hypersensitivities associated with asthma, hormonal imbalance, autoimmune disorders and immunodeficiency. There is little doubt that the condition is multifactorial. Defining the therapeutic role of antibiotics requires some understanding of the pathogenic role of bacteria in CRS.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^4912c1a7]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Adult sinusitis guideline — antibiotics in chronic rhinosinusitis states that clinicians should not routinely prescribe antimicrobial therapy for adults with CRS without acute exacerbation or as a mandatory prerequisite for paranasal sinus imaging or surgery. The action statement identifies aggregate evidence quality Grade A from systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials with a high level of confidence, notes the role of patient preferences as limited, and specifies exceptions of acute exacerbation of CRS and odontogenic infection accompanying CRS, with policy level Recommendation. Supporting text notes that first-line treatment for CRS is nasal saline irrigation and intranasal corticosteroid spray, and that there is no recent evidence for widespread empiric usage of antibiotic therapy for treating CRS; a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial of 50 patients studied 3 weeks of treatment with 3 arms, and clinical improvement was noted with the irrigation and the oral steroid arms but not with the antibiotics.

### Clinical practice guideline on adult sinusitis [^05bcd911]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

This executive summary will alert clinicians to key evidence-based statements in a multidisciplinary, clinical practice guideline on adult sinusitis developed by the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation. Included in the guideline are 17 boldfaced action statements: 3 on viral rhinosinusitis, 7 on acute bacterial rhinosinusitis, and 7 on chronic rhinosinusitis and recurrent acute rhinosinusitis. Evidence profiles that accompany each statement are summarized to show why it was made and how it can be implemented. Guideline statements regarding acute rhinosinusitis focus on diagnosing presumed bacterial illness and using antibiotics appropriately. Guideline statements regarding chronic rhinosinusitis or recurrent acute rhinosinusitis focus on appropriate use of diagnostic tests. Surgical therapy is not discussed.

### Appropriate antibiotic use for acute respiratory tract infection in adults: advice for high-value care from the American College of Physicians and the centers for disease control and prevention [^2001cd74]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Acute respiratory tract infection (ARTI) is the most common reason for antibiotic prescription in adults. Antibiotics are often inappropriately prescribed for patients with ARTI. This article presents best practices for antibiotic use in healthy adults (those without chronic lung disease or immunocompromising conditions) presenting with ARTI.

Methods

A narrative literature review of evidence about appropriate antibiotic use for ARTI in adults was conducted. The most recent clinical guidelines from professional societies were complemented by meta-analyses, systematic reviews, and randomized clinical trials. To identify evidence-based articles, the Cochrane Library, PubMed, MEDLINE, and EMBASE were searched through September 2015 using the following Medical Subject Headings terms: "acute bronchitis", "respiratory tract infection", "pharyngitis", "rhinosinusitis", and "the common cold".

High-Value Care Advice 1

Clinicians should not perform testing or initiate antibiotic therapy in patients with bronchitis unless pneumonia is suspected.

High-Value Care Advice 2

Clinicians should test patients with symptoms suggestive of group A streptococcal pharyngitis (for example, persistent fevers, anterior cervical adenitis, and tonsillopharyngeal exudates or other appropriate combination of symptoms) by rapid antigen detection test and/or culture for group A Streptococcus. Clinicians should treat patients with antibiotics only if they have confirmed streptococcal pharyngitis.

High-Value Care Advice 3

Clinicians should reserve antibiotic treatment for acute rhinosinusitis for patients with persistent symptoms for more than 10 days, onset of severe symptoms or signs of high fever (> 39 °C) and purulent nasal discharge or facial pain lasting for at least 3 consecutive days, or onset of worsening symptoms following a typical viral illness that lasted 5 days that was initially improving (double sickening).

High-Value Care Advice 4

Clinicians should not prescribe antibiotics for patients with the common cold.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^c61db5e6]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Statement 6 — treatment failure for acute bacterial rhinosinusitis specifies that if the patient fails to improve or worsens despite being on an appropriate antibiotic for 3–5 days, the clinician should reassess the patient to confirm ABRS, exclude other causes of illness, and detect complications, and if ABRS is confirmed, the clinician should change the antibiotic; the recommendation is based on expert opinion and first principles for changing therapy with a preponderance of benefit over harm, with an action statement profile citing quality improvement opportunity, aggregate evidence quality Grade D with use of rescue antibiotic in RCTs, level of confidence in evidence moderate, benefits of preventing complications, detecting missed diagnosis, and instituting effective therapy, and risks or costs including delay in changing therapy if the patient fails to improve and medication costs.

### Microbiology and antimicrobial management of sinusitis [^2ddf4f5c]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

The growing resistance to antimicrobial agents of all respiratory tract bacterial pathogens has made the management of sinusitis more difficult. The upper respiratory tract including the nasopharynx serves as the reservoir for pathogenic bacteria that can cause respiratory infections including sinusitis. During a viral respiratory infection, potential pathogens can relocate from the nasopharynx into the sinus cavity, causing sinusitis. Establishment of the correct microbiology of all forms of sinusitis is of primary importance, because it can serve as a guide for choosing the adequate antimicrobial therapy. This article summarizes the current information regarding the microbiology of all forms of sinusitis and approaches to antimicrobial therapy.

Acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) is a common complication of viral upper respiratory tract infections and is associated with a significant socioeconomic burden. Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of ABRS have been produced in association with a number of societies in the United States; these guidelines aim to promote the rational selection of antibiotic therapy to optimize clinical outcomes while minimizing the potential for selection of antibiotic resistance. This article provides an overview of current U.S. guidelines for the treatment of ABRS, focusing on the impact of antibiotic resistance on treatment options.

### Clinical practice guideline: improving nasal form and function after rhinoplasty [^0257f0ea]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Rhinoplasty postoperative antibiotics — statement 7 specifies that when a surgeon, or surgeon's designee, chooses to administer perioperative antibiotics for rhinoplasty, he or she should not routinely prescribe antibiotic therapy for a duration > 24 hours after surgery; this is a recommendation against prescribing based on randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews, with a preponderance of harm over benefit. The action statement profile notes a quality improvement opportunity to reduce antibiotic prescribing after rhinoplasty and promote antibiotic stewardship, aggregate evidence quality Grade B randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews with a preponderance of harm over benefit, medium level of confidence in evidence, benefits of promoting selective use of antibiotics after surgery with reduced adverse effects and cost, and risk of potential infection among patients who might have benefited from > 24 hours of antibiotics but did not receive it; the benefit–harm assessment is a preponderance of benefit over harm.

Acute otitis media is the most common infection for which antibiotics are prescribed in children, resulting in more than 20 million antibiotic prescriptions annually. New practice guidelines published by the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Academy of Family Physicians call for the judicious use of antibiotics in view of increasing antibiotic resistance and the unclear necessity of the use of antibiotics in children with uncomplicated acute otitis media. This article reviews those guidelines, several other common ear, nose, and throat entities, including sinusitis and dental emergencies, and current strategies in diagnosis and treatment.

### Antibiotics for clinically diagnosed acute rhinosinusitis in adults [^2d0778f3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

In primary care settings, the diagnosis of rhinosinusitis is generally based on clinical signs and symptoms. Technical investigations are not routinely performed, nor recommended. Individual trials show a trend in favour of antibiotics, but the balance of benefit versus harm is unclear.

Objectives

To assess the effect of antibiotics in adults with clinically diagnosed rhinosinusitis in primary care settings.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2012), MEDLINE (January 1950 to February week 4, 2012) and EMBASE (January 1974 to February 2012).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of antibiotics versus placebo in participants with rhinosinusitis-like signs or symptoms.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. We contacted trial authors for additional information. We collected information on adverse effects from the trials.

Main Results

We included 10 trials involving 2450 participants. Overall, the risk of bias in these studies was low. Irrespective of the treatment group, 47% of participants were cured after one week and 71% after 14 days. Antibiotics can shorten the time to cure, but only five more participants per 100 will cure faster at any time point between 7 and 14 days if they receive antibiotics instead of placebo (number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB)) 18 (95% confidence interval (CI) 10 to 115, I(2) statistic 0%, eight trials). Purulent secretion resolves faster with antibiotics (odds ratio (OR) 1.58 (95% CI 1.13 to 2.22)), (NNTB 11, 95% CI 6 to 51, I(2) statistic 0%, three trials). However, 27% of the participants who received antibiotics and 15% of those who received placebo experienced adverse events (OR 2.10, 95% CI 1.60 to 2.77) (number needed to treat to harm (NNTH)) 8 (95% CI 6 to 13, I(2) statistic 13%, seven trials). More participants in the placebo group needed to start antibiotic therapy because of an abnormal course of rhinosinusitis (OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.66), NNTH 20 (95% CI 14 to 35, I(2) statistic 0%, eight trials). Only one disease-related complication (brain abscess) occurred in a patient treated with antibiotics.

Authors' Conclusions

The potential benefit of antibiotics in the treatment of clinically diagnosed acute rhinosinusitis needs to be seen in the context of a high prevalence of adverse events. Taking into account antibiotic resistance and the very low incidence of serious complications, we conclude that there is no place for antibiotics for the patient with clinically diagnosed, uncomplicated acute rhinosinusitis. This review cannot make recommendations for children, patients with a suppressed immune system and patients with severe disease, as these populations were not included in the available trials.

### Clinical practice guideline: surgical management of chronic rhinosinusitis [^852e175d]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Chronic rhinosinusitis — antibiotic use and diagnostic evaluation during exacerbations: Despite the limited evidence of the efficacy of short- and long-term antibiotics for routine CRS treatment, the use of antibiotics in CRS patients may be appropriate if bacterial infection results in acute exacerbation, and evidence of purulence within the middle meatus or nasal cavity of a symptomatic CRS patient may reasonably indicate that bacterial infection is contributing to exacerbation. To assess for the presence of sinonasal purulence, anterior rhinoscopy, oropharyngeal examination, or nasal endoscopy can be performed before prescribing antibiotic therapy, and repeated physical examination seems preferable to reflexive antibiotic usage or indiscriminately repeated CT scans. Specific recommendations regarding antibiotic choice, dosage, and treatment duration are not sufficiently supported by published data, but antibiotic selection based on endoscopically guided cultures may provide clinically meaningful improvements in nasal findings and patient-reported symptoms. Known side effects of antibiotic use include gastrointestinal upset, allergic reactions, liver enzyme disruptions, and Clostridium difficile colitis, and there are pertinent concerns about the development of multidrug-resistant bacteria from the inappropriate and injudicious use of antibiotics.

Reducing the duration of antibiotic treatment for respiratory tract infections to combat antimicrobial resistance

Most bacterial RTIs show equal efficacy with fewer adverse events in shorter compared to standard antibiotic courses in clinical trials. This is based on the principle of 'shorter is better', initially conceived one decade ago. However, there are two notable exceptions: otitis media among children under the age of two and streptococcal pharyngitis, in which shorter first-line antibiotic courses are less effective than standard antibiotic courses.

Over the last few decades, most guidelines have recommended standard antimicrobial therapy durations of seven to ten days for lower RTIs. However, few randomised clinical trials have been conducted to determine the minimal effective treatment durations. Despite the low number of patients included in some of these studies, shorter treatment durations, such as two to three days, have been demonstrated not to be inferior to longer durations in terms of clinical efficacy. Initially advocated for uncomplicated urinary tract infections in the early 2000s, an increasing body of evidence suggests that shorter durations of antibiotics are also effective in treating most RTIs (Table 2). Some recent clinical guidelines, like the WHO AWaRe antibiotic book, advocate for five-day courses of antibiotics for acute rhinosinusitis, COPD exacerbations, and community-acquired pneumonia. Despite this evidence, most clinicians still use standard or longer courses.

### Judicious antibiotic use and intranasal corticosteroids in acute rhinosinusitis [^375638b5]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Most patients with symptoms of acute rhinosinusitis are treated with antibiotics. However, many cases of rhinosinusitis are secondary to viral infections and unlikely to benefit from antibiotic therapy. Inappropriate use of antibiotics in patients with acute nonbacterial rhinosinusitis contributes to the increase in bacterial antibiotic resistance. Consequently, safe and effective alternatives to antibiotics are needed in the treatment of acute rhinosinusitis caused by viral infections. Recent results from controlled trials have shown that intranasal corticosteroids, used in combination with antibiotics or as monotherapy in selected cases, provide significant symptom relief and resolution of acute rhinosinusitis. The use of intranasal corticosteroids in acute rhinosinusitis therefore might reduce the inappropriate use of antimicrobial therapy in acute rhinosinusitis.

### Abscess on the nasal tip of a young woman [^43814e46]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Question 3: What is the most appropriate next step in management?
A. Incision and drainage of the patient's lesion and treating her partner with penicillin
B. Empiric treatment with oral terbinafine and obtaining a fungal culture
C. Treating the patient with topical mupirocin ointment and warm compresses
D. Performing a biopsy of the lesion and sending tissue for histopathologic examination
E. Treating the patient with oral clindamycin for gram-positive coverage

Answers:
A. Incision and drainage of the patient's lesion and treating her partner with penicillin – Correct. Abscesses caused by GBS often require incision and drainage, as antibiotics alone may not suffice. Additionally, the patient's partner is an asymptomatic carrier likely reinfecting the patient, so penicillin treatment is appropriate.
B. Empiric treatment with oral terbinafine and obtaining a fungal culture – Incorrect. Although fungal infections can present as refractory nodules, the culture results showing beta-hemolytic, Christie-Atkins-Munch-Petersen-positive gram-positive cocci strongly indicate a bacterial, not fungal, etiology. Oral terbinafine is not warranted here.
C. Treating the patient with topical mupirocin ointment and warm compresses – Incorrect. While topical antibiotics can be effective for superficial bacterial infections, this patient's chronic and refractory nodule suggests a deeper infection requiring more invasive management, such as incision and drainage and systemic antibiotic therapy.
D. Performing a biopsy of the lesion and sending tissue for histopathologic examination – Incorrect. A biopsy could be considered if there was suspicion of an atypical lesion (eg, malignancy or granulomatous infection). However, in this case, the diagnosis is clear based on the culture and clinical features, making biopsy unnecessary as the first-line step.
E. Treating the patient with oral clindamycin for gram-positive coverage – Incorrect. Although clindamycin provides effective gram-positive coverage, incision and drainage is critical in managing abscesses. Treating the partner is also essential to prevent reinfection, which clindamycin alone does not address.

### Clinical practice guideline: surgical management of chronic rhinosinusitis [^862326b1]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) — assessment before prescribing antibacterial therapy: The surgeon or their designee should not prescribe antibacterial therapy to an adult with CRS if significant or persistent purulent nasal discharge (anterior, posterior, or both) is absent on examination. Evidence strength is a strong recommendation based on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that are limited in number but demonstrate a preponderance of benefit over harm when limiting the indiscriminate use of antibiotics for CRS treatment. Benefits include avoiding therapy designed to address an infectious condition when no infection exists; prevent harm and adverse effects from therapy that is not beneficial; limit induced bacterial resistance; reduce cost, while risks include possibly missing or delaying therapy for a bacterial infection that does not have obvious discolored or purulent nasal discharge. The word "significant" is used to allow for clinician judgment regarding the severity of the purulence and the impact on the patient; the word "persistent" is used to limit making a judgment on a single observation. Exceptions note that macrolide antibiotics may exhibit anti-inflammatory properties that may provide therapeutic benefits for select CRS patients, although the data for macrolide antibiotics in CRS treatment are mixed. Supporting context clarifies that antibiotic therapy has had a role in acute bacterial rhinosinusitis, which is characterized by purulent nasal drainage that persists for at least 10 days beyond the onset of upper respiratory symptoms or worsens within 10 days after an initial improvement.

### Antibiotics for the common cold and acute purulent rhinitis [^8dbe7885]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

It has long been believed that antibiotics have no role in the treatment of common colds yet they are often prescribed in the belief that they may prevent secondary bacterial infections.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy of antibiotics compared with placebo for reducing general and specific nasopharyngeal symptoms of acute upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) (common colds). To determine if antibiotics have any influence on the outcomes for acute purulent rhinitis and acute clear rhinitis lasting less than 10 days before the intervention. To determine whether there are significant adverse outcomes associated with antibiotic therapy for participants with a clinical diagnosis of acute URTI or acute purulent rhinitis.

Search Methods

For this 2013 update we searched CENTRAL 2013, Issue 1, MEDLINE (March 2005 to February week 2, 2013), EMBASE (January 2010 to February 2013), CINAHL (2005 to February 2013), LILACS (2005 to February 2013) and Biosis Previews (2005 to February 2013).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any antibiotic therapy against placebo in people with symptoms of acute upper respiratory tract infection for less than seven days, or acute purulent rhinitis less than 10 days in duration.

Data Collection and Analysis

Both review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data.

Main Results

This updated review included 11 studies. Six studies contributed to one or more analyses related to the common cold, with up to 1047 participants. Five studies contributed to one or more analyses relating to purulent rhinitis, with up to 791 participants. One study contributed only to data on adverse events and one met the inclusion criteria but reported only summary statistics without providing any numerical data that could be included in the meta-analyses. Interpretation of the combined data is limited because some studies included only children, or only adults, or only males; a wide range of antibiotics were used and outcomes were measured in different ways. There was a moderate risk of bias because of unreported methods details or because an unknown number of participants were likely to have chest or sinus infections. Participants receiving antibiotics for the common cold did no better in terms of lack of cure or persistence of symptoms than those on placebo (risk ratio (RR) 0.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.59 to 1.51, (random-effects)), based on a pooled analysis of six trials with a total of 1047 participants. The RR of adverse effects in the antibiotic group was 1.8, 95% CI 1.01 to 3.21, (random-effects). Adult participants had a significantly greater risk of adverse effects with antibiotics than with placebo (RR 2.62, 95% CI 1.32 to 5.18) (random-effects) while there was no greater risk in children (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.63). The pooled RR for persisting acute purulent rhinitis with antibiotics compared to placebo was 0.73 (95% CI 0.47 to 1.13) (random-effects), based on four studies with 723 participants. There was an increase in adverse effects in the studies of antibiotics for acute purulent rhinitis (RR 1.46, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.94).

Authors' Conclusions

There is no evidence of benefit from antibiotics for the common cold or for persisting acute purulent rhinitis in children or adults. There is evidence that antibiotics cause significant adverse effects in adults when given for the common cold and in all ages when given for acute purulent rhinitis. Routine use of antibiotics for these conditions is not recommended.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis [^c0975a90]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

This guideline provides evidence-based recommendations on managing sinusitis, defined as symptomatic inflammation of the paranasal sinuses. Sinusitis affects 1 in 7 adults in the United States, resulting in about 31 million individuals diagnosed each year. Since sinusitis almost always involves the nasal cavity, the term rhinosinusitis is preferred. The guideline target patient is aged 18 years or older with uncomplicated rhinosinusitis, evaluated in any setting in which an adult with rhinosinusitis would be identified, monitored, or managed. This guideline is intended for all clinicians who are likely to diagnose and manage adults with sinusitis.

Purpose

The primary purpose of this guideline is to improve diagnostic accuracy for adult rhinosinusitis, reduce inappropriate antibiotic use, reduce inappropriate use of radiographic imaging, and promote appropriate use of ancillary tests that include nasal endoscopy, computed tomography, and testing for allergy and immune function. In creating this guideline the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation selected a panel representing the fields of allergy, emergency medicine, family medicine, health insurance, immunology, infectious disease, internal medicine, medical informatics, nursing, otolaryngology-head and neck surgery, pulmonology, and radiology.

Results

The panel made strong recommendations that 1) clinicians should distinguish presumed acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) from acute rhinosinusitis caused by viral upper respiratory infections and noninfectious conditions, and a clinician should diagnose ABRS when (a) symptoms or signs of acute rhinosinusitis are present 10 days or more beyond the onset of upper respiratory symptoms, or (b) symptoms or signs of acute rhinosinusitis worsen within 10 days after an initial improvement (double worsening), and 2) the management of ABRS should include an assessment of pain, with analgesic treatment based on the severity of pain. The panel made a recommendation against radiographic imaging for patients who meet diagnostic criteria for acute rhinosinusitis, unless a complication or alternative diagnosis is suspected. The panel made recommendations that 1) if a decision is made to treat ABRS with an antibiotic agent, the clinician should prescribe amoxicillin as first-line therapy for most adults, 2) if the patient worsens or fails to improve with the initial management option by 7 days, the clinician should reassess the patient to confirm ABRS, exclude other causes of illness, and detect complications, 3) clinicians should distinguish chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) and recurrent acute rhinosinusitis from isolated episodes of ABRS and other causes of sinonasal symptoms, 4) clinicians should assess the patient with CRS or recurrent acute rhinosinusitis for factors that modify management, such as allergic rhinitis, cystic fibrosis, immunocompromised state, ciliary dyskinesia, and anatomic variation, 5) the clinician should corroborate a diagnosis and/or investigate for underlying causes of CRS and recurrent acute rhinosinusitis, 6) the clinician should obtain computed tomography of the paranasal sinuses in diagnosing or evaluating a patient with CRS or recurrent acute rhinosinusitis, and 7) clinicians should educate/counsel patients with CRS or recurrent acute rhinosinusitis regarding control measures. The panel offered as options that 1) clinicians may prescribe symptomatic relief in managing viral rhinosinusitis, 2) clinicians may prescribe symptomatic relief in managing ABRS, 3) observation without use of antibiotics is an option for selected adults with uncomplicated ABRS who have mild illness (mild pain and temperature < 38.3 degrees C or 101 degrees F) and assurance of follow-up, 4) the clinician may obtain nasal endoscopy in diagnosing or evaluating a patient with CRS or recurrent acute rhinosinusitis, and 5) the clinician may obtain testing for allergy and immune function in evaluating a patient with CRS or recurrent acute rhinosinusitis.

Disclaimer

This clinical practice guideline is not intended as a sole source of guidance for managing adults with rhinosinusitis. Rather, it is designed to assist clinicians by providing an evidence-based framework for decision-making strategies. It is not intended to replace clinical judgment or establish a protocol for all individuals with this condition, and may not provide the only appropriate approach to diagnosing and managing this problem.

### Acute community-acquired bacterial sinusitis: continuing challenges and current management [^385f5219]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Acute sinusitis is one of the most common infections seen in general clinical practice. The most common cause of acute sinusitis is viral; however, many patients receive a prescription for an antibiotic. Such injudicious prescribing habits have a major impact on health care costs, contribute to the increasing prevalence of drug-resistant strains of common respiratory pathogens, and reflect many of the challenges in differentiating viral and bacterial disease. Sinus puncture and culture of the aspirate, the diagnostic reference standard in the research setting, are not appropriate for routine clinical practice. However, certain clinical signs and symptoms that do not improve or that worsen after 7–10 days are currently accepted criteria for diagnosis of bacterial sinusitis. Accurate diagnosis can select patients who would benefit most from antimicrobial use. Antimicrobial agents should be selected on the basis of local resistance patterns, and their spectrum of activity should cover the common bacterial pathogens, including resistant strains.

### Rhinitis 2020: a practice parameter update [^f04fc60f]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Infectious rhinitis — etiology, diagnostic distinction from allergic rhinitis, and antibiotic prescribing patterns are summarized as follows: Infectious rhinitis and rhinosinusitis may be acute or chronic and may range from self-limited rhinitis secondary to common viral upper respiratory infections to more severe disease caused by other pathogens, and acute infectious rhinitis is usually a result of 1 of many viruses with secondary bacterial rhinosinusitis a possible complication. Viral infections account for as many as 98% of acute infectious rhinitis. While symptoms may overlap with allergic rhinitis (AR), the presence of a recurrent seasonal pattern of symptoms, the presence of an obvious allergic trigger, and symptoms of nasal or ocular pruritus strongly suggest the diagnosis of AR. Inappropriate prescribing of antibiotics is often secondary to misinterpretation of infectious viral rhinitis/rhinosinusitis as bacterial disease, leading to overprescribing antibiotics and a subsequent increase in antibiotic resistance, with recent research demonstrating antibiotic prescribing rates as high as 69% to 79% for acute infectious rhinitis, which may account for up to 60% of all antibiotic prescriptions written by providers, despite often a lack of benefit and increased risk of adverse effects, including resistance.

### Antibiotics for adults with clinically diagnosed acute rhinosinusitis: a meta-analysis of individual patient data [^688a248f]. Lancet (2008). Excellent credibility.

Background

Primary-care physicians continue to overprescribe antibiotics for acute rhinosinusitis because distinction between viral and bacterial sinus infection is difficult. We undertook a meta-analysis of randomised trials based on individual patients' data to assess whether common signs and symptoms can be used to identify a subgroup of patients who benefit from antibiotics.

Methods

We identified suitable trials — in which adult patients with rhinosinusitis-like complaints were randomly assigned to treatment with an antibiotic or a placebo — by searching the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Medline, and Embase, and reference lists of reports describing such trials. Individual patients' data from 2547 adults in nine trials were checked and re-analysed. We assessed the overall effect of antibiotic treatment and the prognostic value of common signs and symptoms by the number needed to treat (NNT) with antibiotics to cure one additional patient.

Findings

15 patients with rhinosinusitis-like complaints would have to be given antibiotics before an additional patient was cured (95% CI NNT[benefit] 7 to NNT[harm] 190). Patients with purulent discharge in the pharynx took longer to cure than those without this sign; the NNT was 8 patients with this sign before one additional patient was cured (95% CI NNT[benefit] 4 to NNT[harm] 47). Patients who were older, reported symptoms for longer, or reported more severe symptoms also took longer to cure but were no more likely to benefit from antibiotics than other patients.

Interpretation

Common clinical signs and symptoms cannot identify patients with rhinosinusitis for whom treatment is clearly justified. Antibiotics are not justified even if a patient reports symptoms for longer than 7–10 days.

### High-dose vs standard-dose amoxicillin plus clavulanate for adults with acute sinusitis: a randomized clinical trial [^8695a992]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Conclusions

How can clinicians help their patients with presumed acute bacterial sinusitis as defined by the current IDSA guidelines? This randomized clinical trial found that adding more amoxicillin to the standard, but minimally beneficial, treatment with amoxicillin and clavulanate does not appear to be the answer. Quinolones have shown some efficacybut are not without risks, including black box warnings. The best policy may be, therefore, to emphasize the use, also in accordance with IDSA guidelines, of saline flushes and nasal steroids.

### Clinical practice guideline (update): adult sinusitis [^85b082f7]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

This update of a 2007 guideline from the American Academy of Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery Foundation provides evidence-based recommendations to manage adult rhinosinusitis, defined as symptomatic inflammation of the paranasal sinuses and nasal cavity. Changes from the prior guideline include a consumer added to the update group, evidence from 42 new systematic reviews, enhanced information on patient education and counseling, a new algorithm to clarify action statement relationships, expanded opportunities for watchful waiting (without antibiotic therapy) as initial therapy of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS), and 3 new recommendations for managing chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS).

Purpose

The purpose of this multidisciplinary guideline is to identify quality improvement opportunities in managing adult rhinosinusitis and to create explicit and actionable recommendations to implement these opportunities in clinical practice. Specifically, the goals are to improve diagnostic accuracy for adult rhinosinusitis, promote appropriate use of ancillary tests to confirm diagnosis and guide management, and promote judicious use of systemic and topical therapy, which includes radiography, nasal endoscopy, computed tomography, and testing for allergy and immune function. Emphasis was also placed on identifying multiple chronic conditions that would modify management of rhinosinusitis, including asthma, cystic fibrosis, immunocompromised state, and ciliary dyskinesia.

Action Statements

The update group made strong recommendations that clinicians (1) should distinguish presumed ABRS from acute rhinosinusitis (ARS) caused by viral upper respiratory infections and noninfectious conditions and (2) should confirm a clinical diagnosis of CRS with objective documentation of sinonasal inflammation, which may be accomplished using anterior rhinoscopy, nasal endoscopy, or computed tomography. The update group made recommendations that clinicians (1) should either offer watchful waiting (without antibiotics) or prescribe initial antibiotic therapy for adults with uncomplicated ABRS; (2) should prescribe amoxicillin with or without clavulanate as ﬁrst-line therapy for 5 to 10 days (if a decision is made to treat ABRS with an antibiotic); (3) should reassess the patient to confirm ABRS, exclude other causes of illness, and detect complications if the patient worsens or fails to improve with the initial management option by 7 days after diagnosis or worsens during the initial management; (4) should distinguish CRS and recurrent ARS from isolated episodes of ABRS and other causes of sinonasal symptoms; (5) should assess the patient with CRS or recurrent ARS for multiple chronic conditions that would modify management, such as asthma, cystic fibrosis, immunocompromised state, and ciliary dyskinesia; (6) should confirm the presence or absence of nasal polyps in a patient with CRS; and (7) should recommend saline nasal irrigation, topical intranasal corticosteroids, or both for symptom relief of CRS. The update group stated as options that clinicians may (1) recommend analgesics, topical intranasal steroids, and/or nasal saline irrigation for symptomatic relief of viral rhinosinusitis; (2) recommend analgesics, topical intranasal steroids, and/or nasal saline irrigation) for symptomatic relief of ABRS; and (3) obtain testing for allergy and immune function in evaluating a patient with CRS or recurrent ARS. The update group made recommendations that clinicians (1) should not obtain radiographic imaging for patients who meet diagnostic criteria for ARS, unless a complication or alternative diagnosis is suspected, and (2) should not prescribe topical or systemic antifungal therapy for patients with CRS.

### Principles of judicious antibiotic prescribing for upper respiratory tract infections in pediatrics [^49e75691]. Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Most upper respiratory tract infections are caused by viruses and require no antibiotics. This clinical report focuses on antibiotic prescribing strategies for bacterial upper respiratory tract infections, including acute otitis media, acute bacterial sinusitis, and streptococcal pharyngitis. The principles for judicious antibiotic prescribing that are outlined focus on applying stringent diagnostic criteria, weighing the benefits and harms of antibiotic therapy, and understanding situations when antibiotics may not be indicated. The principles can be used to amplify messages from recent clinical guidelines for local guideline development and for patient communication; they are broadly applicable to antibiotic prescribing in general.

### Antibiotics for upper respiratory tract infections: an overview of cochrane reviews [^b2f3af79]. Respiratory Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Objectives

The aim of this paper is to review the four Cochrane reviews of antibiotics for upper respiratory tract infections.

Methods

Each Cochrane review was read and summarized, and results presented as odds ratios (as in the Internet version) and, where relevant, numbers needed to treat.

Results

The reviews of antibiotics for acute otitis media have concluded that benefit is not great with a number needed to treat for a benefit (NNTB) of 15. Recent US guidelines are recommending a delay in prescriptions in children over the age of 6 months. For streptococcal tonsillitis, the Cochrane reviewers suggest that antibiotic use seems to be discretionary rather than prohibited or mandatory. This is because the benefit in terms of symptoms is only about 16h (NNTB from 2 to 7 at day 3 for pain) compared with placebo, and that serious complications, such as rheumatic fever and glomerulonephritis, are now rare in developed countries. The reviewers do, however, suggest that antibiotics are considered in populations in whom these complications are more common. This is an area of debate, as the Infectious Disease Society of America (2002) recommends routine treatment. [Clin. Infect. Dis. 35 (2002) 113] There is good evidence and consensus that there is no indication for antibiotics for the common cold. The situation with acute purulent rhinitis is less clear, as new evidence suggests that antibiotics may be effective for acute purulent rhinitis (NNTB from 6 to 8). However, as most people with acute purulent rhinitis improve without antibiotics, giving antibiotics is not justified as an initial treatment. For acute maxillary sinusitis, the evidence suggests that antibiotics are effective for people with radiologically confirmed sinusitis. The reviewers suggest that clinicians should weigh up the modest benefits (NNTB from 3 to 6) against the potential for adverse effects.

Conclusion

The use of antibiotics for acute otitis media, sore throat and streptococcal tonsillitis, common cold and acute purulent rhinitis, and acute maxillary sinusitis seems to be discretionary rather than prohibited or mandatory, at least for non-severe cases.

### How to approach a patient hospitalized for pneumonia who is not responding to treatment? [^c89cca9a]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Similarly, addition of vancomycin or linezolid to treat MRSA is often considered in patients with clinical deterioration. Risk of acquisition of MRSA during hospitalization varies but is generally uncommon if good infection prevention practices are in place. The negative predictive value of MRSA nasal swabs (via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or culture) is high; thus, if the MRSA nasal screening test is negative then it is reasonable to either discontinue or forgo the addition of anti-MRSA empiric therapy.

One additional caveat regarding non-responders relates to appropriate drug and adequate dose of antibiotics. For example, if vancomycin is prescribed for MRSA, but therapeutic levels take 4 days to achieve, one could see a clinical decline or non-response to treatment. Similarly, if daptomycin was started for other reasons, it would not be expected to cover a secondary pneumonia with MRSA because it is inactivated by pulmonary surfactant. Underdosing of beta-lactam antibiotics directed at Gram-negative organisms occurs frequently, although patients in the ICU with sepsis have altered pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics that can result in increased clearance of antibiotics. For these reasons, many ICUs preferentially administer beta-lactam agents via continuous or extended infusion.

### WITHDRAWN: antibiotics for persistent nasal discharge (rhinosinusitis) in children [^57825401]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Nasal discharge (rhinosinusitis) is extremely common in children. It is the result of inflammation of the mucosa of the upper respiratory tract, and is usually due to either infection or allergy. Infections may be caused by bacteria.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness of antibiotics versus placebo or standard therapy in treating children with persistent nasal discharge (rhinosinusitis) for at least 10 days.

Search Strategy

In this updated review, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2005) which includes the ARI Group's specialised trials register; MEDLINE (1966 to April Week 3, 2005) EMBASE (1997 to December 2004), and the references of relevant articles were searched. Authors and pharmaceutical companies were contacted.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials that compared antibiotics versus placebo or standard therapy. Trials which included the use of other medications were included if all participants were allowed equal access to such medications or if the additional or alternative therapies were regarded as ineffective. Trials that only combined or compared antibiotics with surgery, or sinus puncture and lavage, were not included in the review.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were extracted by a single author for the following eight outcomes: overall clinical failure (primary outcome), failure to cure, failure to improve, clinical improvement, time to resolution, complications, side-effects and bacteriologic failure. For the dichotomous outcome variables of each individual study, proportional and absolute risk reductions were calculated using a modified intention-to-treat analysis. The summary weighted risk ratio and 95% confidence interval (CI) (fixed effect model) were calculated using the inverse of the variance of each study result for weighting (Cochrane statistical package, RevMan version 4.2).

Main Results

A total of six studies involving 562 children compared antibiotics with placebo or standard therapy. All studies were randomised but most were still susceptible to bias. Five of the studies were conducted in emergency, allergy or ENT clinics. Four of the studies required children to have x-ray changes consistent with sinusitis. Only the primary outcome (overall clinical failure) was reported in all studies. Around 40% of all randomised children did not have a clinical success documented when reviewed two to six weeks after randomisation. The control event rate varied from to 22 to 71% (mean 46%). The risk ratio estimated using a fixed effects model was 0.75 (95% CI 0.61 to 0.92). There was no evidence of statistical heterogeneity. Side effects (sufficient to cease treatment) occurred in 4 of 189 control group children (four studies). More children treated with antibiotics had side effects (17 of 330), but this difference was not statistically significant (RR 1.75, 95% CI 0.63 to 4.82).

Authors' Conclusions

For children with persistent nasal discharge or older children with radiographically confirmed sinusitis, the available evidence suggests that antibiotics will reduce the probability of persistence in the short to medium-term. The benefits appear to be modest and around eight children must be treated in order to achieve one additional cure (number needed to treat (NNT) 8, 95% CI 5 to 29). No long term benefits have been documented. These conclusions are based on a small number of small randomised controlled trials and may require revision as additional data become available.

### Systemic and topical antibiotics for chronic rhinosinusitis [^ab3ebe00]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

This review is one of six looking at the primary medical management options for patients with chronic rhinosinusitis. Chronic rhinosinusitis is common and is characterised by inflammation of the lining of the nose and paranasal sinuses leading to nasal blockage, nasal discharge, facial pressure/pain and loss of sense of smell. The condition can occur with or without nasal polyps. Systemic and topical antibiotics are used with the aim of eliminating infection in the short term (and some to reduce inflammation in the long term), in order to normalise nasal mucus and improve symptoms.

Objectives

To assess the effects of systemic and topical antibiotics in people with chronic rhinosinusitis.

Search Methods

The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Trials Register; CENTRAL (2015, Issue 8); MEDLINE; EMBASE; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 29 September 2015.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a follow-up period of at least three months comparing systemic or topical antibiotic treatment to (a) placebo or (b) no treatment or (c) other pharmacological interventions.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes were disease-specific health-related quality of life (HRQL), patient-reported disease severity and the commonest adverse event - gastrointestinal disturbance. Secondary outcomes included general HRQL, endoscopic nasal polyp score, computerised tomography (CT) scan score and the adverse events of suspected allergic reaction (rash or skin irritation) and anaphylaxis or other very serious reactions. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence for each outcome; this is indicated in italics.

Main Results

We included five RCTs (293 participants), all of which compared systemic antibiotics with placebo or another pharmacological intervention. The varying study characteristics made comparison difficult. Four studies recruited only adults and one only children. Three used macrolide, one tetracycline and one a cephalosporin-type antibiotic. Three recruited only patients with chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps, one recruited patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps and one had a mixed population. Three followed up patients for 10 to 12 weeks after treatment had finished. Systemic antibiotics versus placebo Three studies compared antibiotics with placebo (176 participants). One study (64 participants, without polyps) reported disease-specific HRQL using the SNOT-20 (0 to 5, 0 = best quality of life). At the end of treatment (three months) the SNOT-20 score was lower in the group receiving macrolide antibiotics than the placebo group (mean difference (MD) -0.54 points, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.98 to -0.10), corresponding to a moderate effect size favouring antibiotics (moderate quality evidence). Three months after treatment, it is uncertain if there was a difference between groups. One study (33 participants, with polyps) provided information on gastrointestinal disturbances and suspected allergic reaction (rash or skin irritation) after a short course of tetracycline antibiotic compared with placebo. We are very uncertain if antibiotics were associated with an increase in gastrointestinal disturbances (risk ratio (RR) 1.36, 95% CI 0.22 to 8.50) or skin irritation (RR 6.67, 95% CI 0.34 to 128.86) (very low quality evidence). Systemic antibiotics plus saline irrigation and intranasal corticosteroids versus placebo plus saline irrigation and intranasal corticosteroids One study (60 participants, some with and some without polyps) compared a three-month course of macrolide antibiotic with placebo; all participants also used saline irrigation and 70% used intranasal corticosteroids. Disease-specific HRQL was reported using SNOT-22 (0 to 110, 0 = best quality of life). Data were difficult to interpret (highly skewed and baseline imbalances) and it is unclear if there was an important difference at any time point (low quality evidence). To assess patient-reported disease severity participants rated the effect of treatment on a five-point scale (-2 for "desperately worse" to 2 for "cured") at the end of treatment (three months). For improvement in symptoms there was no difference between the antibiotics and placebo groups; the RR was 1.50 (95% CI 0.81 to 2.79; very low quality evidence), although there were also slightly more people who felt worse after treatment in the antibiotics group. There was no demonstrable difference in the rate of gastrointestinal disturbances between the groups (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.16 to 7.10). General HRQL was measured using the SF-36. The authors stated that there was no difference between groups at the end of treatment (12 weeks) or two weeks later. Systemic antibiotics versus intranasal corticosteroids One study (43 participants, without polyps) compared a three-month course of macrolide antibiotic with intranasal corticosteroids. Patient-reported disease severity was assessed using a composite symptom score (0 to 40; 0 = no symptoms). It is very uncertain if there was a difference as patient-reported disease severity was similar between groups (MD -0.32, 95% CI -2.11 to 1.47; low quality evidence). Systemic antibiotics versus oral corticosteroids One study (28 participants, with polyps) compared a short course of tetracycline antibiotic (unclear duration, ˜20 days) with a 20-day course of oral corticosteroids. We were unable to extract data on any of the primary efficacy outcomes. It is uncertain if there was a difference ingastrointestinal disturbances (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.16 to 6.14) or skin irritation (RR 2.00, 95% CI 0.20 to 19.62) as the results for these outcomes were similar between groups (very low quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

We found very little evidence that systemic antibiotics are effective in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis. We did find moderate quality evidence of a modest improvement in disease-specific quality of life in adults with chronic rhinosinusitis without polyps receiving three months of a macrolide antibiotic. The size of improvement was moderate (0.5 points on a five-point scale) and only seen at the end of the three-month treatment; by three months later no difference was found. Despite a general understanding that antibiotics can be associated with adverse effects, including gastrointestinal disturbances, the results in this review were very uncertain because the studies were small and few events were reported. No RCTs of topical antibiotics met the inclusion criteria. More research in this area, particularly evaluating longer-term outcomes and adverse effects, is required.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^5600ca63]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Adult sinusitis guideline — Statement 1a (differential diagnosis of acute rhinosinusitis) states that clinicians should distinguish presumed acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) from acute rhinosinusitis caused by viral upper respiratory infections and noninfectious conditions. A clinician should diagnose ABRS when symptoms or signs of acute rhinosinusitis (purulent nasal drainage accompanied by nasal obstruction, facial pain-pressure-fullness, or both) persist without evidence of improvement for at least 10 days beyond the onset of upper respiratory symptoms, or when symptoms or signs of acute rhinosinusitis worsen within 10 days after an initial improvement (double worsening). This is a strong recommendation based on diagnostic studies with minor limitations and a preponderance of benefit over harm. The action statement profile notes a quality improvement opportunity to avoid inappropriate use of antibiotics for presumed viral infections, aggregate evidence quality Grade B and Level of Confidence in Evidence Medium, a benefits-harm assessment of preponderance of benefit over harm, and harms including the risk of misclassifying acute bacterial rhinosinusitis as viral, or vice-versa, with intentional vagueness and role of patient preferences listed as none.

### Acute sinusitis in children: do antibiotics have any role? [^4ad6bfc1]. The Journal of Infection (2014). Low credibility.

Bacteria can be recovered from paranasal sinuses in the majority of patients given the diagnosis of acute bacterial sinusitis (ABS), and bacteriologic cure can be achieved with appropriate antibiotic treatment. The critical question is whether bacteriologic cure correlates with meaningful clinical endpoints such as clinical improvement, reduction in recurrent disease, or prevention of complications. Of the 4 pediatric placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials (PCRCTs), 2 suggest superiority of antibiotic treatment and 2 suggest lack of superiority. PCRCTs in adults are mixed as to clinical benefit. Pediatric and adult meta-analyses demonstrate modest benefit of antibiotic therapy and rates of spontaneous recovery without antibiotics of 60–65%. Although retrospective studies indicate that some patients who develop orbital or neurologic complications of sinusitis were pre-treated with antibiotic therapy, a low rate of complications precludes determination of whether antibiotic treatment prevents complications in some proportion of patients. Like the literature evidence, expert guideline recommendations are mixed. Although the evidence base is incomplete and conflicting, the limited data suggest that antibiotics probably do have a role in the treatment of pediatric ABS. The most compelling rationale is prevention of serious complications, but proof for this rationale is lacking.

### SHEA statement on antibiotic stewardship in hospitals during public health emergencies [^a14db9e9]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2022). Medium credibility.

What microbiologic and radiographic diagnostic tests are appropriate if antibiotics are started for patients with possible bacterial coinfection?

Recommendations

Before initiating antibiotics, HCP should attempt to establish a microbiologic diagnosis.
HCP should limit respiratory multiplex PCR tests to ICU patients and patients who require broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy.
HCP should restrict repeat microbiologic testing to changes in a patient's clinical status.
HCP should perform a nasal MRSA swab for patients started on anti-MRSA treatment.
HCP should not perform routine testing for fungal infection in the absence of a clinical presentation that raises that concern.
HCP should review the necessity of antibiotics within 48–72 hours, as results from tests become available, and should de-escalate or discontinue antibiotic therapy based on those results and clinical response. Procalcitonin results may aid the de-escalation or discontinuation of antibiotic treatments.
HCP should obtain chest radiographs to assess the extent of lung involvement, but daily repeat studies are not indicated. Use of CT of the chest should be reserved for circumstances in which results of the CT may result in a change in clinical management (eg, pulmonary embolus).

Discussion

As noted, HCP should not obtain microbiologic studies for patients without clinical signs and symptoms suggesting a bacterial coinfection. However, in all cases in which antibiotics are started in patients with severe disease (eg, in the ICU) and those requiring broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy, HCP should obtain relevant samples, for example, sputum cultures and, as appropriate, lower respiratory PCR for a microbiologic diagnosis. Those tests can help HCP appropriately choose definitive therapy or identify opportunities to de-escalate or stop antibiotic treatments. Rapid multiplex PCR can have a role in antibiotic stewardship for critically ill patientsif clinicians are supported by ASPs to interpret and trust those results. Nasal PCR screening for MRSA allows de-escalation for anti-MRSA therapy (eg, vancomycin) in patients with severe CAP and those with risk factors (eg, recent hospitalization, recent receipt of antimicrobial therapy, or prior isolation of MRSA), and has been shown to have up to 100% negative predictive value, including for hospitalized patients with COVID-19.

### Clinical practice guideline: improving nasal form and function after rhinoplasty [^08396012]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Antibiotics after rhinoplasty — The purpose is to encourage surgeons who choose to prescribe antibiotics after rhinoplasty to prescribe them for no more than 24 hours, and the GDG supports the use of a single preoperative dose and no more than 24 hours of postoperative antibiotics if postsurgical therapy is prescribed. Value judgments note antibiotics are commonly prescribed despite a lack of evidence to support benefits beyond a single intraoperative dose or > 24 hours after surgery, and the policy level states Recommendation against. Reported wound infection rates are low, with a small infection rate (0.48–0.6%) after septorhinoplasty among patients not given prophylactic antibiotics; in one study without preoperative antibiotics, Staphylococcus epidermidis (82.7%) and Streptococcus viridans (17.3%) were most common and no patient had a local or systemic infection during a 60-day follow-up period. Literature also supports a preoperative dose within 1 hour before incision and no more than 24 hours of postoperative coverage for clean-contaminated surgery.

### Diagnosis and management of rhinosinusitis: a practice parameter update [^0e5ca29a]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) — antibiotics versus watchful waiting: Although the literature suggests that antibiotics shorten the time to cure in ABRS, there is concern about the adverse effects of antibiotics, including resistance. A previous expert panel recommended a watchful waiting approach with antibiotics in nonsevere ABRS, and the panel recommended re-evaluation as necessary and antibiotics if there was worsening or no improvement with symptomatic therapy. A Cochrane database review assessed the effect of antibiotics in uncomplicated ABRS in a primary care setting and concluded that antibiotics are not recommended as first-line treatment in adults with clinically diagnosed ABRS, with their review of 10 trials finding that irrespective of the treatment group, 47% of patients were cured after 1 week and 71% after 2 weeks; this review did not make recommendations for pediatric patients, patients with suppressed immune system, and patients with severe disease.

### Sinusitis (acute) [^6757e8cb]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2011). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute sinusitis is defined pathologically, by transient inflammation of the mucosal lining of the paranasal sinuses lasting less than 4 weeks. Clinically, it is characterised by nasal congestion, rhinorrhoea, facial pain, hyposmia, sneezing, and, if more severe, additional malaise and fever. It affects 1% to 5% of the adult population each year in Europe.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatments in people with clinically diagnosed acute sinusitis, and in people with radiologically or bacteriologically confirmed acute sinusitis? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to June 2011 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 19 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: antibiotics (amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid [co-amoxiclav], doxycycline, cephalosporins, macrolides; different doses, long-course regimens), antihistamines, decongestants (xylometazoline, phenylephrine, pseudoephedrine), saline nasal washes, steam inhalation, and topical corticosteroids (intranasal).

Acute rhinosinusitis — management of incomplete response and escalation: For resolved uncomplicated rhinosinusitis, no further evaluation is needed, but for partial response clinicians should continue antibiotic treatment for another 10 to 14 days or consider a different antibiotic. For poor response, which worsens after 3 to 5 days, consider broadening microbial coverage or switch to a different antimicrobial that covers resistant bacteria, and rhinosinusitis that fails to improve after 21 to 28 days of initial antibiotic treatment might be due to pathogens not adequately covered by prior antibiotics, nasal polyps, tumor, or noncompliance. Reinforce comfort and prevention measures, consider a sinus CT scan if not already done with more detailed evaluation of underlying risk factors, and consider consultation with an allergist‑immunologist or an otolaryngologist for immunodeficiency, unusual pathogens, allergic factors, or structural abnormalities.

Severe-onset cases are presumed bacterial because "a temperature of at least 39°C/102.2°F coexisting for at least 3 consecutive days with purulent nasal discharge is not consistent with the well-documented pattern of acute viral URI", and "children with worsening-course acute bacterial sinusitis have a clinical course that is also not consistent with the steady improvement that characterizes an uncomplicated viral URI"; additionally, "In both guidelines, however, children presenting with severe or worsening illness (which was not defined explicitly in the 2001 guideline) are to receive antibiotic therapy".

### Antibiotics for sinusitis… [^4d6980e8]. AAFP (2018). Low credibility.

Don't routinely prescribe antibiotics for acute mild-to-moderate sinusitis unless symptoms last for ten or more days OR symptoms worsen after initial clinical improvement. Most sinusitis in the ambulatory setting is due to a viral infection that will resolve on its own. Despite consistent recommendations to the contrary, antibiotics are prescribed in over 80% of outpatient visits for acute sinusitis. Sinusitis accounts for 16 million office visits and $5. 8 billion in annual health care. Sources: AAO-HNSF Updated Clinical Practice Guideline: Adult Sinusitis Sinusitis is one of the most common diagnoses in primary care. Annually, it accounts for 15% to 20% of adult antibiotic prescriptions and costs more than $20 million in patient visits.

Current recommendations strongly support not prescribing antibiotics within the first week of illness for mild to moderate sinusitis. A meta-analysis published in 2012 in the Archives of Internal Medicine states that some randomized controlled trials showed that patients assigned to antibiotics had a 7% to 14% higher rate of improvement in symptoms. However, these researchers concluded that the potential harms from use of antibiotics to manage sinusitis, including adverse effects, increased risk of antibiotic resistance, and cost, clearly outweigh the potential minor benefits. A Cochrane review compiled data from 59 studies that involved the use of a variety of antibiotics to manage simple maxillary sinus infection in primary care settings. Studies that compared antibiotics with placebo showed that, in most cases, symptoms improved within two weeks, regardless of whether the participant received an antibiotic or not.

The review found that, in addition to patient-related adverse effects, antibiotic use poses the risk of increased resistance to antibiotics among community-acquired pathogens.

### Identifying children likely to benefit from antibiotics for acute sinusitis: a randomized clinical trial [^877f1e04]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

Importance

The large overlap between symptoms of acute sinusitis and viral upper respiratory tract infection suggests that certain subgroups of children being diagnosed with acute sinusitis, and subsequently treated with antibiotics, derive little benefit from antibiotic use.

Objective

To assess if antibiotic therapy could be appropriately withheld in prespecified subgroups.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Randomized clinical trial including 515 children aged 2 to 11 years diagnosed with acute sinusitis based on clinical criteria. The trial was conducted between February 2016 and April 2022 at primary care offices affiliated with 6 US institutions and was designed to evaluate whether symptom burden differed in subgroups defined by nasopharyngeal Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, or Moraxella catarrhalis on bacterial culture and by the presence of colored nasal discharge.

Interventions

Oral amoxicillin (90 mg/kg/d) and clavulanate (6.4 mg/kg/d) (n = 254) or placebo (n = 256) for 10 days.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was symptom burden based on daily symptom scores on a validated scale (range, 0–40) during the 10 days after diagnosis. Secondary outcomes included treatment failure, adverse events including clinically significant diarrhea, and resource use by families.

Results

Most of the 510 included children were aged 2 to 5 years (64%), male (54%), White (52%), and not Hispanic (89%). The mean symptom scores were significantly lower in children in the amoxicillin and clavulanate group (9.04 [95% CI, 8.71 to 9.37]) compared with those in the placebo group (10.60 [95% CI, 10.27 to 10.93]) (between-group difference, -1.69 [95% CI, -2.07 to -1.31]). The length of time to symptom resolution was significantly lower for children in the antibiotic group (7.0 days) than in the placebo group (9.0 days) (P = 0.003). Children without nasopharyngeal pathogens detected did not benefit from antibiotic treatment as much as those with pathogens detected; the between-group difference in mean symptom scores was -0.88 (95% CI, -1.63 to -0.12) in those without pathogens detected compared with -1.95 (95% CI, -2.40 to -1.51) in those with pathogens detected. Efficacy did not differ significantly according to whether colored nasal discharge was present (the between-group difference was -1.62 [95% CI, -2.09 to -1.16] for colored nasal discharge vs -1.70 [95% CI, -2.38 to -1.03] for clear nasal discharge; P = 0.52 for the interaction between treatment group and the presence of colored nasal discharge).

Conclusions

In children with acute sinusitis, antibiotic treatment had minimal benefit for those without nasopharyngeal bacterial pathogens on presentation, and its effects did not depend on the color of nasal discharge. Testing for specific bacteria on presentation may represent a strategy to reduce antibiotic use in this condition.

Acute bacterial rhinosinusitis — initial treatment and safety: Empiric treatment with an antibiotic approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) should be started once the diagnosis is made, and empiric therapy is administered for 7 to 14 days using FDA‑approved options (amoxicillin, amoxicillin‑clavulanate, cefaclor, cefprozil, cefuroxime, cefdinir, cefixime, azithromycin, levofloxacin, trimethoprim‑sulfamethoxazole, doxycycline, and clindamycin). Fluoroquinolones and doxycycline should be avoided in children, nasal steroids may be of benefit, and patients should be instructed to follow up if symptoms worsen or if they have not improved within 3 to 5 days of treatment.

### Acute rhinosinusitis: rapid evidence review [^1d7920a8]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Acute rhinosinusitis causes more than 30 million patients to seek health care per year in the United States. Respiratory tract infections, including bronchitis and sinusitis, account for 75% of outpatient antibiotic prescriptions in primary care. Sinusitis is a clinical diagnosis; the challenge lies in distinguishing between the symptoms of bacterial and viral sinusitis. Cardinal features of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis are unilateral facial pain or pressure, fever greater than 102°F (39°C), and purulent nasal discharge with obstruction of the nasal passages. Antibiotics should be considered for patients with 3 or more days of severe symptoms, significant worsening after 3 to 5 days of symptoms, or 7 or more days of symptoms. Diagnostic testing for acute rhinosinusitis with antral puncture is impractical because of its invasiveness. Point-of-care testing for elevated C-reactive protein may be helpful, but it is not widely available. Studies have shown that amoxicillin is as effective as amoxicillin-clavulanate as a first-line treatment for acute bacterial rhinosinusitis for those without a beta-lactam allergy. For patients with a beta-lactam allergy, appropriate antibiotics include doxycycline or a respiratory fluoroquinolone; clindamycin plus a third-generation cephalosporin is an option for children with non-type I hypersensitivity to beta-lactam antibiotics. Supportive care for rhinosinusitis, including use of saline irrigation, nasal steroids or antihistamines, and decongestants, may help reduce the severity of symptoms. Most episodes of rhinosinusitis are self-limited, lasting 7 to 10 days. Complications of rhinosinusitis are rare but may include orbital cellulitis, meningitis, and abscess. Computed tomography and referral to an otolaryngologist should be considered for patients with recurrent rhinosinusitis or concern about complications.

NEW STRATEGIES TO AVOID ANTIBIOTICS

Probiotics

A double-blinded placebo-controlled study published in May 2024 randomized 174 women with histories of recurrent UTIs to 1 of 4 groups to look at the effect of commercially available probiotics, consisting of lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria, on UTI recurrence rates. Patients received an oral and vaginal placebo, an oral probiotic with a vaginal placebo, a vaginal probiotic with an oral placebo, or both a vaginal and oral probiotic. The incidence of symptomatic UTI at 4 months was significantly lower in the groups receiving vaginal probiotics either with a placebo or with oral probiotics, compared with groups receiving placebo only or just an oral probiotic. This difference was still present at 12 months and translated to a significantly longer time to the first symptomatic UTI. This study provides the most definitive evidence yet that probiotics, and specifically vaginal probiotics, deserve consideration as a possible strategy to prevent UTIs and limit the need for antibiotic use.

Acute Respiratory Tract Illnesses

Another RCT published in 2024 looked at the ability of nasal sprays to reduce the use of antibiotics for the treatment of acute respiratory illnesses. In this study, 13 799 patients who were at high risk of adverse outcomes from respiratory infections or had a history of frequent respiratory tract infections were randomized to 1 of 4 arms: usual care, a gel-based nasal spray, a saline nasal spray, or a behavioral website. Those in the nasal spray groups were given instructions to use the nasal sprays at the first signs of an illness or after or during potential exposures. The primary outcome was the total number of self-reported days of respiratory tract illness in the previous 6 months, which was significantly reduced in both groups receiving nasal spray. Importantly, the number of courses of antibiotics, a key secondary outcome, was also significantly reduced in the nasal spray groups.

### Acute sinusitis in children [^c85542fa]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Acute rhinosinusitis is a common illness in children. Viral upper respiratory tract infection is the most common presentation of rhinosinusitis. Most children resolve the infection spontaneously and only a small proportion develops a secondary bacterial infection. The proper choice of antibiotic therapy depends on the likely infecting pathogens, bacterial antibiotic resistance, and pharmacologic profiles of antibiotics. Amoxicillin-clavulanate is currently recommended as the empiric treatment in those requiring antimicrobial therapy. Isolation of the causative agents should be considered in those who failed the initial treatment. In addition to antibiotics, adjuvant therapies and surgery may be used in the management of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis.

### Optimising antibiotic exposure by customising the duration of treatment for respiratory tract infections based on patient needs in primary care [^923938c0]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The judicious use of antibiotics preserves millions of lives and safeguards numerous individuals from infectious complications annually. However, their continued viability is threatened by rising rates of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), which was responsible for an estimated 1.27 million deaths worldwide in 2019. Excessive and inappropriate antimicrobial use significantly contributes to this crisis. Research indicates a strong correlation between the consumption of antibiotics and the selection of resistant bacteria, both at societal and individual levels.

Primary care is responsible for about 80% of antibiotic prescriptions, and respiratory tract infections (RTIs) account for more than half of all antibiotic prescriptions globally. Given the limited development of new antibiotics, prudent antimicrobial utilisation, particularly in primary care, is crucial to mitigating the spread of AMR. Inappropriate use of antibiotics for uncomplicated RTIs is very common worldwide. In the UK around 50% of all general practice consultations for RTIs result in the prescription of an antibiotic, with a high variability across practices ranging from 20% to 80%. In a study comparing the rate of antibiotic prescribing for acute RTIs in Australian general practice from 2010 to 2015, it was found that antibiotics were prescribed at rates 4–9 times higher than those recommended by Australia's most widely used therapeutic guidelines. Even in the Netherlands, which has the lowest antibiotic use in Europe with slightly under ten defined daily doses per 1000 inhabitants per day, it is estimated that nearly half of RTI prescriptions are not in accordance with local guidelines. In the UK, more than half of the patients with acute rhinosinusitis, acute bronchitis and sore throat seen in primary care are treated with antibiotics. In addition, in many regions around the world, antibiotics are accessible without prescriptions, as shown in a recent study of 38 studies across 24 countries, revealing 62% of non-prescription antibiotic dispensing, mostly for suspected RTIs. Despite being more prevalent in low-income countries, even in some high- and middle-income countries, non-prescription antibiotic provision is a concern. Most acute uncomplicated RTIs are caused by viruses and, in otherwise healthy adults, these infections are typically self-limiting and antibiotics provide no relevant benefits.

Acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) — initial antibiotic selection factors for amoxicillin–clavulanate are detailed in Table 7 and would prompt clinicians to consider amoxicillin–clavulanate instead of amoxicillin alone for initial management of ABRS; categories include situations in which bacterial resistance is likely (e.g., antibiotic use in the past month, close contact with a child in a daycare facility, high prevalence of resistant bacteria in community), presence of moderate to severe infection (moderate to severe symptoms of ABRS, frontal or sphenoidal sinusitis), and presence of comorbidity or extremes of life (comorbid conditions including diabetes and chronic cardiac, hepatic, or renal disease; immunocompromised patient; age older than 65 years old).

ICU infections

Ventilator-associated pneumonia

Question

What is the appropriate treatment approach for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)?

Recommendation

Initiation of broad-spectrum antibiotics for VAP requires consideration of patient-specific culture data, recent antibiotic exposure, the local antibiogram, and timing of when infection developed. Common regimens for hospital-acquired infections are vancomycin plus either cefepime or piperacillin-tazobactam or in cases of severe penicillin allergy, aztreonam, although no specific regimen is generally superior. Empiric anaerobic coverage is not routinely recommended. We recommend de-escalation of antibiotic treatment when culture data are available. Seven days of treatment is sufficient for most patients. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) nasal swab testing should be used to determine the need for empiric coverage.

Discussion

Evidence suggests mortality is lower when the initial antibiotic therapy is effective, even when switched to adequate therapy after culture data become available. Therefore, it is important to initiate appropriate antibiotics when there is strong clinical suspicion of VAP. There is no evidence of superiority of one specific empiric regimen over another and appropriateness is targeted in context of the hospital antibiogram and specific patient risk factors.

Trauma is a risk factor for staphylococcal infections, specifically traumatic head injury and road traffic injuries.MRSA nasal swab testing is useful because of its high negative predictive value for MRSA carrier status and if negative can obviate the need for MRSA coverage, as evidenced by recent data in the trauma population. Anaerobic coverage is not routinely recommended due to lack of evidence of benefit and some evidence of harm. Empiric coverage is specifically tailored to S. aureus, Pseudomonas, and Gram-negative bacilli.

High-level evidence shows no benefit with treating longer than 7 days in most patients with exceptions limited to severe lung disease, severe immunosuppression, concomitant ARDS, and multidrug resistance. To de-escalate an antibiotic regimen, it is important that culture data be obtained at the time of diagnosis. Duration of therapy of 7 days and antibiotic de-escalation recommendations are consistent with the ATS/IDSA guidelines of 2016.

### Interventions targeting the nasal microbiome to eradicate methicillin-resistant staphylococcusaureus [^7cf728b7]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Staphylococcus aureus is an important pathogen in many sites, including the bloodstream, skin and soft tissue, bone and joints. When infection is caused by methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), therapy is more difficult and outcomes are less favourable. Nasal colonization is associated with increased risk for MRSA infections. The nasal microbiome may play a role in risk for nasal colonization and infection.

Objectives

To review the role of the microbiome in MRSA nasal colonization and infection.

Sources

Peer-reviewed literature identified in a MEDLINE search using MRSA, S. aureus, prebiotic and microbiota as search terms.

Content

Reduction of S. aureus nasal colonization has been shown to reduce risk of S. aureus infections, but decolonization methods are imperfect. The role of the nasal microbiome in host defence against S. aureus colonization and infection is explored. Numerous organisms have been shown to be negatively associated with S. aureus colonization. The antimicrobial molecules produced by these organisms are an active area of research.

Implications

Future research should focus on development of safe and effective molecules that can inhibit S. aureus in the nasal vestibule. Damage to the diverse nasal microbiota by unnecessary antibiotics should be avoided.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^e3747a0e]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Adult rhinosinusitis scope and definitions — the target patient for this guideline is aged 18 years or older with a clinical diagnosis of uncomplicated rhinosinusitis, where rhinosinusitis is defined as inflammation of the paranasal sinuses and nasal cavity and uncomplicated rhinosinusitis is defined as rhinosinusitis without clinically evident extension of inflammation outside the paranasal sinuses and nasal cavity at the time of diagnosis. Rhinosinusitis may be classified by duration as acute rhinosinusitis (ARS) if less than 4 weeks' duration, or as CRS if lasting more than 12 weeks, with or without acute exacerbations; ARS may be classified further by presumed etiology into acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) or viral rhinosinusitis (VRS), and distinguishing presumed bacterial versus viral infection is important because antibiotic therapy is inappropriate for the latter. When patients have 4 or more annual episodes of ABRS, without persistent symptoms in between, the condition is termed recurrent ARS (RARS). Nearly all experts agree that CRS begins after 12 weeks duration, and we agree with other guideline groups that define ARS as up to 4 weeks' duration; very limited data are available on rhinosinusitis lasting 4 to 12 weeks, sometimes called subacute rhinosinusitis, and we do not distinguish rhinosinusitis in this time frame as an explicit entity in the guideline with decisions individualized.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^b79a5be6]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Table 5 — Patient information sheet on diagnosis of acute sinusitis — defines key diagnostic features and distinguishes viral from bacterial illness for adults. Sinusitis, also called rhinosinusitis, affects about 1 in 8 adults annually. Acute sinusitis is present with up to 4 weeks of cloudy or colored nasal drainage plus one or both of the following: a stuffy, congested, or blocked nose, and pain, pressure or fullness in the face, head, or around the eyes. Acute viral sinusitis is likely if illness has been present less than 10 days without worsening, whereas acute bacterial sinusitis is likely when there is no improvement within 10 days of getting sick or when symptoms worsen within 10 days after beginning to get better. Because treatment differs by cause, acute viral sinusitis does not benefit from antibiotics, but some patients with acute bacterial sinusitis may get better faster with an antibiotic.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^c02e2d71]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Antibiotic Therapy for ABRS Following Initial Treatment Failures — In acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS), if a patient on antibiotics worsens or fails to improve within 3 to 5 days, drug-resistant infection should be considered and therapy switched with reevaluation; when changing therapy, clinicians should consider initial coverage limits, as amoxicillin-treated patients commonly have beta-lactamase-producing H. influenzae (60%), M. catarrhalis (58.3%), or penicillin-resistant pneumococcus (72%). Resistance can be significant, with minimum inhibitory concentration at least 2-fold higher observed in 49% of patients. For multidrug-resistant pathogens, options would include high-dose amoxicillin-clavulanate (4 g per day amoxicillin equivalent) or a respiratory fluoroquinolone if no alternative agents are available, but given the FDA black box warning regarding fluoroquinolones, the decision to use this class should be carefully thought out; oral cephalosporins and macrolides are predicted to offer inadequate coverage for S. pneumoniae or H. influenzae. Safety and follow-up are emphasized: patients who fail antibiotics with a worsening pattern should be examined for complications and, if concerning findings are present, an urgent referral to an otolaryngologist or emergency department is warranted and CT sinuses, or MRI is indicated; a follow-up plan should be made between clinicians and patients.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^20ff43c0]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Antibiotic efficacy rationale and trial interpretation in acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS): The purpose is to promote prescribing of antibiotics with known efficacy and safety for ABRS and to reduce prescribing of antibiotics with potentially inferior efficacy because of a limited antimicrobial spectrum against usual pathogens that cause ABRS in adults. Dozens of RCTs have assessed the comparative clinical efficacy of antibiotics for ABRS in adults, but most participants were not microbiologically confirmed and likely included uncomplicated viral rhinosinusitis (VRS) expected to recover spontaneously; this is supported by the finding that only ~50% clinically diagnosed ABRS had positive bacterial cultures by antral or middle meatal cultures.

### Clinical practice guideline: management of sinusitis [^96aaa703]. Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

This clinical practice guideline formulates recommendations for health care providers regarding the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of children, ages 1 to 21 years, with uncomplicated acute, subacute, and recurrent acute bacterial sinusitis. It was developed through a comprehensive search and analysis of the medical literature. Expert consensus opinion was used to enhance or formulate recommendations where data were insufficient. A subcommittee, composed of pediatricians with expertise in infectious disease, allergy, epidemiology, family practice, and pediatric practice, supplemented with an otolaryngologist and radiologist, were selected to formulate the practice parameter. Several other groups (including members of the American College of Emergency Physicians, American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, American Academy of Asthma, Allergy and Immunology, as well as numerous national committees and sections of the American Academy of Pediatrics) have reviewed and revised the guideline. Three specific issues were considered: 1) evidence for the efficacy of various antibiotics in children; 2) evidence for the efficacy of various ancillary, nonantibiotic regimens; and 3) the diagnostic accuracy and concordance of clinical symptoms, radiography (and other imaging methods), and sinus aspiration. It is recommended that the diagnosis of acute bacterial sinusitis be based on clinical criteria in children ≤ 6 years of age who present with upper respiratory symptoms that are either persistent or severe. Although controversial, imaging studies may be necessary to confirm a diagnosis of acute bacterial sinusitis in children > 6 years of age. Computed tomography scans of the paranasal sinuses should be reserved for children who present with complications of acute bacterial sinusitis or who have very persistent or recurrent infections and are not responsive to medical management. There were only 5 controlled randomized trials and 8 case series on antimicrobial therapy for acute bacterial sinusitis in children. However, these data, plus data derived from the study of adults with acute bacterial sinusitis, support the recommendation that acute bacterial sinusitis be treated with antimicrobial therapy to achieve a more rapid clinical cure. Children with complications or suspected complications of acute bacterial sinusitis should be treated promptly and aggressively with antibiotics and, when appropriate, drainage. Based on controversial and limited data, no recommendations are made about the use of prophylactic antimicrobials, ancillary therapies, or complementary/alternative medicine for prevention and treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis. This clinical practice guideline is not intended as a sole source of guidance in the diagnosis and management of acute bacterial sinusitis in children. It is designed to assist pediatricians by providing an analytic framework for evaluation and treatment. It is not intended to replace clinical judgment or establish a protocol for all patients with this condition.

### Antibiotics for acute maxillary sinusitis [^546dbd37]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

For adults seeking care in ambulatory medical practices, sinusitis is the most common diagnosis treated with antibiotics.

Objectives

We examined whether antibiotics are indicated for acute sinusitis, and if so, which antibiotic classes are most effective.

Search Strategy

Relevant studies were identified from searches of MEDLINE and EMBASE in December 2001, contacts with pharmaceutical companies and bibliographies of included studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomized trials were eligible that compared antibiotic to control or antibiotics from different classes, for acute maxillary sinusitis. Additional criteria for inclusion were diagnostic confirmation by radiograph or sinus aspiration, outcomes that included clinical cure or improvement, and a sample size of 30 or more adults. Of 2058 potentially relevant studies, two or more reviewers identified 49 studies meeting selection criteria.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were extracted independently by two persons and synthesized descriptively. Some data were analyzed quantitatively using a random effects model. Primary outcomes were: a) clinical cure, and b) clinical cure or improvement. Secondary outcomes were radiographic improvement, relapse rates, and dropouts due to adverse effects.

Main Results

Forty-nine trials, involving 13,660 participants, evaluated antibiotic treatment for acute maxillary sinusitis. Major comparisons were antibiotic versus control (n of 5); newer, non-penicillin antibiotic versus penicillin class (n of 10); and amoxicillin-clavulanate versus other extended spectrum antibiotics (n of 17), where n is the number of trials. Most trials were conducted in otolaryngology settings. Only 8 trials described adequate allocation and concealment procedures; 20 were double-blind. Compared to control, penicillin improved clinical cures [relative risk (RR) 1.72; 95% CI 1.00 to 2.96]. Treatment with amoxicillin did not significantly improve cure rates (RR 2.06; 95% CI 0.65 to 6.53) but there was significant variability between studies. Radiographic outcomes were improved by antibiotic treatment. Comparisons between classes of antibiotics showed no significant differences: newer non-penicillins versus penicillins (RR for cure 1.07; 95% CI 0.99 to 1.17); newer non-penicillins versus amoxicillin-clavulanate (RR for cure 1.03; 95% CI 0.96 to 1.11). Compared to amoxicillin-clavulanate, dropouts due to adverse effects were significantly lower for cephalosporin antibiotics (RR 0.47; 95% CI 0.30 to 0.73). Relapse rates within one month of successful therapy were 7.7%.

Reviewer's Conclusions

For acute maxillary sinusitis confirmed radiographically or by aspiration, current evidence is limited but supports the use of penicillin or amoxicillin for 7 to 14 days. Clinicians should weigh the moderate benefits of antibiotic treatment against the potential for adverse effects.

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of acute bacterial sinusitis in children aged 1 to 18 years [^fb734ce7]. Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To update the American Academy of Pediatrics clinical practice guideline regarding the diagnosis and management of acute bacterial sinusitis in children and adolescents.

Methods

Analysis of the medical literature published since the last version of the guideline (2001).

Results

The diagnosis of acute bacterial sinusitis is made when a child with an acute upper respiratory tract infection (URI) presents with (1) persistent illness (nasal discharge [of any quality] or daytime cough or both lasting more than 10 days without improvement), (2) a worsening course (worsening or new onset of nasal discharge, daytime cough, or fever after initial improvement), or (3) severe onset (concurrent fever[temperature ≥ 39°C/102.2°F] and purulent nasal discharge for at least 3 consecutive days). Clinicians should not obtain imaging studies of any kind to distinguish acute bacterial sinusitis from viral URI, because they do not contribute to the diagnosis; however, a contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan of the paranasal sinuses should be obtained whenever a child is suspected of having orbital or central nervous system complications. The clinician should prescribe antibiotic therapy for acute bacterial sinusitis in children with severe onset or worsening course. The clinician should either prescribe antibiotic therapy or offer additional observation for 3 days to children with persistent illness. Amoxicillin with or without clavulanate is the firstline treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis. Clinicians should reassess initial management if there is either a caregiver report of worsening(progression of initial signs/symptoms or appearance of new signs/symptoms) or failure to improve within 72 hours of initial management. If the diagnosis of acute bacterial sinusitis is confirmed in a child with worsening symptoms or failure to improve, then clinicians may change the antibiotic therapy for the child initially managed with antibiotic or initiate antibiotic treatment of the child initially managed with observation.

Conclusions

Changes in this revision include the addition of a clinical presentation designated as "worsening course", an option to treat immediately or observe children with persistent symptoms for 3 days before treating, and a review of evidence indicating that imaging is not necessary in children with uncomplicated acute bacterial sinusitis.

### Beginning antibiotics for acute rhinosinusitis and choosing the right treatment [^f702da10]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2006). Low credibility.

Acute bacterial sinusitis (ABS) is an extremely common problem in both children and adults. There are three clinical presentations of acute sinusitis: (1) onset with persistent symptoms (nasal symptoms or cough or both for > 10 but < 30 d without evidence of improvement); (2) onset with severe symptoms (high fever and purulent nasal discharge for 3–4 consecutive days); and (3) onset with worsening symptoms (respiratory symptoms, with or without fever, which worsen after several days of improvement). Images to confirm the presence of acute sinusitis are necessary in older children (> 6 years) and adults to enhance the certainty of diagnosis. The predominant bacterial species that are implicated in acute sinusitis are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis in children. In the last decade, there has been an increasing prevalence of penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae, and beta-lactamase-producing H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis. Although there has been some controversy in the literature regarding the effectiveness of antibiotics in the treatment of ABS, most studies in which the diagnosis of acute bacterial sinusitis is confirmed with images and appropriate anti-biotics are prescribed show superior outcomes in recipients of antibiotics. Therapy may be initiated with high-dose amoxicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanate. In penicillin-allergic patients or those who are unresponsive to amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate is appropriate. Alternatives include cefuroxime, cefpodoxime, or cefdinir. In cases of serious drug allergy, clarithromycin or azithromycin may be prescribed. The optimal duration of therapy is unknown. Some recommend treatment until the patient becomes free of symptoms and then for an additional 7 d.

### Antibiotics for acute maxillary sinusitis in adults [^f347cf0c]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Sinusitis is one of the most common diagnoses among adults in ambulatory care, accounting for 15% to 21% of all adult outpatient antibiotic prescriptions. However, the role of antibiotics for sinusitis is controversial.

Objectives

To assess the effects of antibiotics in adults with acute maxillary sinusitis by comparing antibiotics with placebo, antibiotics from different classes and the side effects of different treatments.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL 2013, Issue 2, MEDLINE (1946 to March week 3, 2013), EMBASE (1974 to March 2013), SIGLE (OpenSIGLE, later OpenGrey (accessed 15 January 2013)), reference lists of the identified trials and systematic reviews of placebo-controlled studies. We also searched for ongoing trials via ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). We imposed no language or publication restrictions.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing antibiotics with placebo or antibiotics from different classes for acute maxillary sinusitis in adults. We included trials with clinically diagnosed acute sinusitis, confirmed or not by imaging or bacterial culture.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened search results, extracted data and assessed trial quality. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) for differences between intervention and control groups in whether the treatment failed or not. All measures are presented with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We conducted the meta-analyses using either the fixed-effect or random-effects model. In meta-analyses of the placebo-controlled studies, we combined data across antibiotic classes. Primary outcomes were clinical failure rates at 7 to 15 days and 16 to 60 days follow-up. We used GRADEpro to assess the quality of the evidence.

Main Results

We included 63 studies in this updated review; nine placebo-controlled studies involving 1915 participants (seven of the studies clearly conducted in primary care settings) and 54 studies comparing different classes of antibiotics (10 different comparisons). Five studies at low risk of bias comparing penicillin or amoxicillin to placebo provided information on the main outcome: clinical failure rate at 7 to 15 days follow-up, defined as a lack of full recovery or improvement, for participants with symptoms lasting at least seven days. In these studies antibiotics decreased the risk of clinical failure (pooled RR of 0.66, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.94, 1084 participants randomised, 1058 evaluated, moderate quality evidence). However, the clinical benefit was small. Cure or improvement rates were high in both the placebo group (86%) and the antibiotic group (91%) in these five studies. When clinical failure was defined as a lack of full recovery (n = five studies), results were similar: antibiotics decreased the risk of failure (pooled RR of 0.73, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.85, high quality evidence) at 7 to 15 days follow-up. Adverse effects in seven of the nine placebo-controlled studies (comparing penicillin, amoxicillin, azithromycin or moxicillin to placebo) were more common in antibiotic than in placebo groups (median of difference between groups 10.5%, range 2% to 23%). However, drop-outs due to adverse effects were rare in both groups: 1.5% in antibiotic groups and 1% in control groups. In the 10 head-to-head comparisons, none of the antibiotic preparations were superior to another. However, amoxicillin-clavulanate had significantly more drop-outs due to adverse effects than cephalosporins and macrolides.

Authors' Conclusions

There is moderate evidence that antibiotics provide a small benefit for clinical outcomes in immunocompetent primary care patients with uncomplicated acute sinusitis. However, about 80% of participants treated without antibiotics improved within two weeks. Clinicians need to weigh the small benefits of antibiotic treatment against the potential for adverse effects at both the individual and general population levels.

Table 2 — Initial antibiotic use for acute bacterial sinusitis in children delineates therapy by presentation: for uncomplicated disease, the table lists Antibiotic therapy for severe and worsening illness and Antibiotic therapy or additional observation for 3 days for persistent illness, and for acute bacterial sinusitis with orbital or intracranial complications it lists Antibiotic therapy. Severe acute bacterial sinusitis is defined as temperature ≥ 39°C with purulent nasal discharge present concurrently for at least 3 consecutive days; worsening illness is defined by sudden worsening with new-onset fever ≥ 38° C/100.4° F or substantial increase in nasal discharge or cough after transient improvement; persistent illness is defined by nasal discharge, daytime cough, or both, persisting for > 10 days without improvement. A footnote notes an "Opportunity for shared decision-making" and that a mechanism must be in place to ensure follow-up and begin antibiotics if the child worsens at any time or fails to improve within 3 days of observation.

Acute bacterial sinusitis in children — treatment research priorities call for determining the optimal duration of antimicrobial therapy, evaluating a "wait-and-see prescription" strategy for persistent symptoms, selecting the optimal antimicrobial agent while balancing narrow-spectrum choices with disease microbiology and resistance patterns, determining the causes and treatment of subacute, recurrent acute, and chronic bacterial sinusitis, establishing the efficacy of antimicrobial prophylaxis to prevent RABS, assessing effects of resistance among S pneumoniae, H influenzae, and M catarrhalis via randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies, defining the role of adjuvant therapies (antihistamines, nasal corticosteroids, mucolytics, decongestants, nasal irrigation) through prospective randomized trials, determining whether early treatment prevents orbital or central nervous system complications, evaluating complementary and alternative medicine strategies through systematic, prospective, randomized clinical trials, and developing new bacterial and viral vaccines to reduce incidence.

One concern with facial lacerations is potential communication with the oral cavity, which carries a significant bacterial load. Lacerations that are confined to the intraoral cavity (including mucous membranes, the lips, and the tongue) and do not communicate with the extraoral environment do not need antibiotics. Through-and-through lacerations have been considered at higher risk for infection, and therefore antibiotics are often suggested, although this remains controversial given the limited data. There are almost no specific data to inform antibiotic prophylaxis for scalp wounds specifically, so it seems reasonable to extrapolate from the management of other traumatic soft tissue wounds. Traumatic cartilage exposure (ear, nose) has historically been treated with prophylactic antibiotics (often fluoroquinolones) in addition to local wound care due to concern for perichondritis. Fluoroquinolones have been used because pseudomonas is a common cause of all-cause perichondritis, but most of these cases are related to piercings, and it is unclear whether the trauma population follows the same microbial pattern. Evidence to support systemic antibiotics in these injuries is lacking. Thus, as above, we think a practical approach would be to risk stratify the wound and the patient and use antibiotics only sparingly in truly high-risk situations.

Nasal packing

Are prophylactic antibiotics indicated in the setting of nasal packing?

Recommendations: Prophylactic antibiotics are not recommended in the setting of nasal packing for traumatic epistaxis given a lack of data showing benefit.

Discussion: Nasal packing material is often placed when other efforts at controlling epistaxis have failed. Packing can stay in place for an amount of time varying from a few hours to many days. Infectious concerns with nasal packing include rhinosinusitis, otitis media, and toxic shock syndrome. However, multiple recent studies have found routine systemic antibiotic prophylaxis to be neither effective at reducing infection rates nor cost-effective given the risks and complications of antibiotics. Rates of infection associated with nasal packing are very low at baseline, and cases of toxic shock syndrome secondary to nasal packing are almost non-existent from the last decade. Due to this low infection rate, the many small studies that have attempted to study the role of empiric antibiotic prophylaxis are grossly underpowered to show any significant difference.

### Adult rhinosinusitis: diagnosis and management [^a743ebd8]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Rhinosinusitis can be divided among four subtypes: acute, recurrent acute, subacute and chronic, based on patient history and a limited physical examination. In most instances, therapy is initiated based on this classification. Antibiotic therapy, supplemented by hydration and decongestants, is indicated for seven to 14 days in patients with acute, recurrent acute or subacute bacterial rhinosinusitis. For patients with chronic disease, the same treatment regimen is indicated for an additional four weeks or more, and a nasal steroid may also be prescribed if inhalant allergies are known or suspected. Nasal endoscopy and computed tomography of the sinuses are reserved for circumstances that include a failure to respond to therapy as expected, spread of infection outside the sinuses, a question of diagnosis and when surgery is being considered. Laboratory tests are infrequently necessary and are reserved for patients with suspected allergies, cystic fibrosis, immune deficiencies, mucociliary disorders and similar disease states. Findings on endoscopically guided microswab culture obtained from the middle meatus correlate 80 to 85 percent of the time with results from the more painful antral puncture technique and is performed in patients who fail to respond to the initial antibiotic selection. Surgery is indicated for extranasal spread of infection, evidence of mucocele or pyocele, fungal sinusitis or obstructive nasal polyposis, and is often performed in patients with recurrent or persistent infection not resolved by drug therapy.

Acute rhinitis/rhinosinusitis — viral vs bacterial differentiation and imaging — has few distinguishing clinical features, and nasal culture/cytology provide minimal assistance; acute viral infections can produce computed tomography changes that mimic acute bacterial rhinosinusitis, so computed tomography should be deferred unless complications are a concern, with abnormalities seen in up to 70% of children and as many as 87% of adults during the common cold; most guidelines suggest deferring antibiotic treatment for 7 to 10 days after symptom onset of infectious rhinosinusitis to avoid overuse of antibiotics.

Acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) — treatment initiation criteria: Summary Statement 20: Treat for ABRS if symptoms last longer than 10 days or with recurrences of symptoms after progressive improvement (Rec, B). Although most cases of ARS are viral in origin, treatment of bacterial infection should be considered when symptoms last longer than 7 to 10 days or with recrudescence of symptoms after progressive improvement.
