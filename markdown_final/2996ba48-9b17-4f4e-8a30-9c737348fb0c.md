## Question

Can you give Imodium with antibiotic based diarrhea?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether Imodium (loperamide) can be given for diarrhea that occurs while taking antibiotics, and how to do so safely and effectively. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "antibiotic-associated diarrhea" means clinically and how often it reflects Clostridioides difficile infection. Then, I should verify the major safety risks of loperamide in inflammatory or invasive diarrheas. Next, I will review guideline positions on antimotility agents in suspected or confirmed C. difficile and in other infectious diarrheas. After that, I should consider special populations and scenarios where loperamide may be acceptable. Finally, I will outline a practical, stepwise management plan and summarize the bottom line with clear guardrails for when to avoid versus when to consider loperamide cautiously.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity. Antibiotic-associated diarrhea spans a spectrum from mild, self-limited changes in stool frequency to severe colitis, and a key concern is C. difficile infection, which can present days to weeks after antibiotic exposure and ranges from watery diarrhea to life-threatening toxic megacolon. I need to ensure I keep a high index of suspicion for C. difficile whenever diarrhea follows antibiotics, especially with systemic features or risk factors like older age, prolonged hospitalization, or multiple antibiotics [^116D3h9u] [^117XrdDV] [^111oNqdy].

> Now, I should review the core safety signal. Loperamide slows intestinal motility, which can trap pathogens and toxins and, in inflammatory or invasive diarrheas, increase the risk of severe complications such as ileus, toxic megacolon, and sepsis; deaths have been reported in children, and the FDA labeling explicitly warns against use in acute dysentery, invasive bacterial enterocolitis, and pseudomembranous colitis, so I need to be very cautious about using it when C. difficile or invasive features are possible [^114jxRY5] [^115N6Nhg] [^111Qhugr].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should verify guideline positions. The IDSA recommends that antimotility agents like loperamide be avoided in suspected or proven inflammatory diarrhea or where toxic megacolon may result, and the ACG C. difficile guideline advises that antimotility agents should be avoided in untreated CDI and in fulminant infection; once appropriate anti-CDI therapy has been initiated, antimotility agents can be used on an as-needed basis, but I need to ensure CDI has been reasonably excluded before considering loperamide at all [^112Udzyb] [^111TsenT].

> Wait, let me verify the nuance for non-CDI antibiotic-associated diarrhea. In immunocompetent adults with acute watery, noninflammatory diarrhea, guidelines allow consideration of loperamide as symptomatic therapy once hydration is addressed, but I should confirm there is no fever, blood in stool, severe abdominal pain, or systemic toxicity. In those settings, the benefit of symptom control may outweigh risks, though the evidence quality is weak and I must counsel patients to stop and seek care if red flags develop [^112Udzyb] [^114fuMUB].

> I need to check special populations. Children under 2 years should not receive loperamide due to risk of paralytic ileus, and IDSA recommends avoiding antimotility drugs in children under 18 with acute diarrhea. In older adults, I should be cautious about reduced hepatic clearance and monitor closely. In immunocompromised patients, the threshold to avoid antimotility agents is lower because of infection severity and risk of complications, so I should generally avoid loperamide there unless a specialist directs otherwise [^114WStea] [^113DRoeK] [^115N6Nhg].

> Let me consider the traveler's diarrhea scenario, because it often overlaps with antibiotic exposure. ACG supports adjunctive loperamide with antibiotics for traveler's diarrhea to shorten duration and improve cure rates, but only when there is no dysentery or systemic toxicity; I should double-check that the patient has nonbloody, nonfebrile watery diarrhea before combining loperamide with an antibiotic regimen in this context [^113rtjXK] [^114fuMUB].

> Next, I should review a practical, stepwise approach. First, assess severity and red flags: fever, hematochezia, severe abdominal pain, dehydration, immunocompromise, or recent broad-spectrum antibiotics should prompt stool testing for C. difficile and consideration of alternative diagnoses before any antimotility therapy; if C. difficile is suspected or confirmed, treat CDI and avoid loperamide until anti-CDI therapy is underway and the patient is clinically improving; if C. difficile is excluded and the patient is an immunocompetent adult with mild, watery, noninflammatory diarrhea, loperamide can be considered with close follow-up and clear stop criteria if symptoms worsen or persist beyond 48 hours [^111TsenT] [^1168yV1K] [^11624SxF].

> I should confirm dosing and safety counseling if loperamide is used. The adult OTC maximum is 8 mg/day, and prescription use allows up to 16 mg/day; start with 4 mg then 2 mg after each loose stool, not exceeding the daily maximum, and stop if constipation, abdominal distention, or ileus symptoms occur; patients should be instructed to seek urgent care for fever, blood in stool, severe pain, or no improvement in 48 hours, and I need to ensure they are maintaining hydration with oral rehydration solutions [^113S8Gnj] [^11624SxF] [^115N6Nhg].

> But wait, what if we want to prevent recurrence or mitigate antibiotic effects. I should consider probiotics for prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea in appropriate patients, as high-quality evidence shows reduced incidence with agents like Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG or Saccharomyces boulardii, though probiotics are not a treatment for acute infectious diarrhea and should not replace evaluation for C. difficile when clinically indicated [^1149No1w] [^116mEQBg] [^116KUigC].

> Bottom line, I need to ensure the message is precise. Do not use Imodium for antibiotic-associated diarrhea when there are features of invasive or inflammatory disease, when C. difficile is suspected or confirmed, or in children under 2 years; in immunocompetent adults with mild, noninflammatory, watery antibiotic-associated diarrhea and no red flags, loperamide may be used cautiously with clear stop criteria and close follow-up, recognizing that the priority is to diagnose and treat underlying causes and maintain hydration [^114jxRY5] [^111TsenT] [^112Udzyb].

---

Imodium (loperamide) can be used for **antibiotic-associated diarrhea** in adults when the diarrhea is mild to moderate, watery, and there are no signs of invasive disease (fever, blood in stool, severe abdominal pain) or C. difficile infection [^notfound]. It is **not recommended for children under 2 years** or for severe or bloody diarrhea [^114jxRY5] [^114WStea]. If diarrhea persists beyond 48 hours or worsens, stop loperamide and seek medical evaluation [^11624SxF]. Always prioritize hydration and treat the underlying cause when possible [^115N6Nhg].

---

## Indications for loperamide use in antibiotic-associated diarrhea

Loperamide is indicated for symptomatic control of **acute nonspecific diarrhea**, including mild to moderate antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) in adults [^1157LbBo]. It is particularly useful when diarrhea is watery, without signs of invasive disease or systemic toxicity [^112Udzyb].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines provide clear recommendations on the use of loperamide in AAD:

- **Adults**: Loperamide may be considered for immunocompetent adults with acute watery diarrhea, including mild AAD, provided there are no signs of invasive disease or systemic toxicity [^112Udzyb] [^113rtjXK].

- **Children**: Loperamide is not recommended for children under 2 years of age due to the risk of serious adverse effects, including paralytic ileus and respiratory depression [^113DRoeK] [^114WStea].

- **Severe or bloody diarrhea**: Loperamide should be avoided in cases of severe or bloody diarrhea, as it may mask underlying invasive infections or inflammatory conditions [^114jxRY5].

---

## Contraindications and precautions

Loperamide use is contraindicated or requires caution in the following scenarios:

| **Condition** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| Children under 2 years | Contraindicated due to risk of paralytic ileus and respiratory depression [^notfound] |
| Severe or bloody diarrhea | Contraindicated due to risk of masking invasive infections [^114jxRY5] |
| Pseudomembranous colitis (C. difficile infection) | Contraindicated due to risk of toxic megacolon [^114jxRY5] |
| Hepatic impairment | Use with caution due to reduced first-pass metabolism [^114WStea] |
| Pregnancy and lactation | Use with caution; consult healthcare provider |

---

## Potential risks and side effects

While loperamide is generally well tolerated, potential risks and side effects include:

- **Common side effects**: Constipation, dizziness, drowsiness, abdominal cramps, nausea [^notfound].

- **Serious adverse effects**: Paralytic ileus, toxic megacolon (particularly in patients with C. difficile infection or inflammatory bowel disease), respiratory depression (especially in children) [^115N6Nhg].

- **Drug interactions**: Loperamide is a substrate of P-glycoprotein, and concomitant use of P-glycoprotein inhibitors (e.g. quinidine, ritonavir) may increase loperamide plasma levels and risk of adverse effects [^11624SxF].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting loperamide use in AAD

Limited clinical studies specifically address loperamide use in AAD; however, evidence from acute infectious diarrhea suggests that loperamide can effectively reduce stool frequency and duration of diarrhea in adults without signs of invasive disease [^111Qhugr]. A meta-analysis showed that loperamide reduced diarrhea prevalence at 24 and 48 hours and shortened the duration of diarrhea in travelers' diarrhea and noncholera watery diarrhea syndromes [^111Qhugr].

---

## Alternative treatments and adjunctive therapies

In addition to loperamide, **alternative treatments and adjunctive therapies** for AAD include:

- **Probiotics**: Moderate-quality evidence suggests that probiotics (e.g. Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Saccharomyces boulardii) can reduce the incidence and duration of antibiotic-associated diarrhea in children and adults [^1149No1w] [^114T18MD].

- **Bismuth subsalicylate**: Effective in reducing stool frequency and duration of diarrhea, particularly in travelers' diarrhea [^113rtjXK].

- **Oral rehydration therapy**: Essential for maintaining hydration, especially in children and elderly patients [^1164A9pt].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Patients using loperamide for AAD should be monitored for clinical improvement within 48 hours. If diarrhea persists beyond 48 hours, worsens, or is accompanied by fever, blood in stool, or severe abdominal pain, loperamide should be discontinued and medical evaluation sought [^11624SxF].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Loperamide (Imodium) can be used for mild to moderate antibiotic-associated diarrhea in adults without signs of invasive disease or systemic toxicity** [^notfound].

- **It is contraindicated in children under 2 years, severe or bloody diarrhea, and in cases of suspected or confirmed C. difficile infection** [^114fuMUB] [^114jxRY5] [^111TsenT].

- **Always prioritize hydration and address the underlying cause of diarrhea**.

- **Monitor for adverse effects and discontinue if symptoms persist or worsen beyond 48 hours** [^11624SxF].

---

Imodium (loperamide) can be used for **antibiotic-associated diarrhea** in adults with mild to moderate, watery diarrhea and no signs of invasive disease or C. difficile infection. It is not recommended for children under 2 years or for severe or bloody diarrhea. Always prioritize hydration and treat the underlying cause when possible [^112Udzyb].

### Diarrhoea in adults (acute) [^115VtUge]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2008). Medium credibility.

Introduction

An estimated 4000 million cases of diarrhoea occurred worldwide in 1996, resulting in 2.5 million deaths.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatments for acute diarrhoea in adults living in resource-rich countries? What are the effects of treatments for acute mild-to-moderate diarrhoea in adults from resource-rich countries traveling to resource-poor countries? What are the effects of treatments for acute mild-to-moderate diarrhoea in adults living in resource-poor countries? What are the effects of treatments for acute severe diarrhoea in adults living in resource-poor countries? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to January 2007 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 71 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: antibiotics, antimotility agents, antisecretory agents, bismuth subsalicylate, diet, intravenous rehydration, nasogastric tube rehydration, and oral rehydration solutions (amino acid oral rehydration solution, bicarbonate oral rehydration solution, reduced osmolarity oral rehydration solution, rice-based oral rehydration solution, standard oral rehydration solution).

### Probiotics for the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea in adults: a meta-analysis of randomized placebo-controlled trials [^114wa6fk]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

METHODS

This meta-analysis was conducted strictly following the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses.

Selection Criteria

Inclusion criteria: (1) patients limited to the adults both inpatients and outpatients who were prescribed antibiotics for various reasons with probiotics (experimental groups) or placebo (control group); (2) providing the occurrence of AAD; and (3) the study designed as an RCT.

Exclusion criteria: (1) duplicate studies, animal researches, preclinical studies, and case reports; (2) not-blinded trials; (3) unknown probiotics composition; and (4) existing diarrhea in baseline or containing laxative-related diarrhea.

Literature Search

The databases involving the PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library were searched for the RCTs on probiotics to prevent AAD. Publications in any language from the databases inception to February 2020 were included. The search terms were the combinations of the following Mesh terms and key words: "probiotic(s)", "diarrhea", "anti-bacterial agents", "antibiotic(s)", "antibiotic-associated diarrhea", "placebo", "randomized", and "randomized controlled trial".

Data Extraction and Quality Assessment

The data extraction was conducted using the standardized form by 2 independent researchers (W.L. and Q.Z.). The primary outcome was the occurrence of AAD during the follow-up period. The secondary outcome was the incidence of adverse events. Other data extracted included demographics, participant setting, indications for antibiotics, probiotics species and dosage, probiotics duration, time from antibiotics to probiotics, follow-up period, and diarrhea definition.

The Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventionswas applied to assess the quality of the selected studies. Two researchers assessed the eligibility and quality of each article independently. Any discrepancies were resolved through consensus, adjudicated with the support of a third investigator.

Antibiotic chemoprophylaxis for traveler's diarrhea — An NIH-sponsored consensus meeting concluded that routine antibiotic chemoprophylaxis should not be used, and subsequent evaluations have recommended against prophylaxis except in high-risk groups, with standard practice unchanged for 20 years. Developments challenging this stance include recognition that postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome is an important chronic health consequence after TD and the availability of rifaximin, a non-absorbable antibiotic that may provide a safer alternative than fluoroquinolones; however, safety concerns with antibiotic use of any class remain an important consideration.

### Antimicrobial drugs for treating cholera [^113FYm6P]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Cholera is an acute watery diarrhoea caused by infection with the bacterium Vibrio cholerae, which if severe can cause rapid dehydration and death. Effective management requires early diagnosis and rehydration using oral rehydration salts or intravenous fluids. In this review, we evaluate the additional benefits of treating cholera with antimicrobial drugs.

Objectives

To quantify the benefit of antimicrobial treatment for patients with cholera, and determine whether there are differences between classes of antimicrobials or dosing schedules.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Infectious Disease Group Specialized Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); PubMed; EMBASE; African Index Medicus; LILACS; Science Citation Index; metaRegister of Controlled Trials; WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform; conference proceedings; and reference lists to March 2014.

Selection Criteria

Randomized and quasi-randomized controlled clinical trials in adults and children with cholera that compared: 1) any antimicrobial treatment with placebo or no treatment; 2) different antimicrobials head-to-head; or 3) different dosing schedules or different durations of treatment with the same antimicrobial.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently applied inclusion and exclusion criteria, and extracted data from included trials. Diarrhoea duration and stool volume were defined as primary outcomes. We calculated mean difference (MD) or ratio of means (ROM) for continuous outcomes, with 95% confidence intervals (CI), and pooled data using a random-effects meta-analysis. The quality of evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

Thirty-nine trials were included in this review with 4623 participants. Antimicrobials versus placebo or no treatment Overall, antimicrobial therapy shortened the mean duration of diarrhoea by about a day and a half compared to placebo or no treatment (MD -36.77 hours, 95% CI -43.51 to -30.03, 19 trials, 1013 participants, moderate quality evidence). Antimicrobial therapy also reduced the total stool volume by 50% (ROM 0.5, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.56, 18 trials, 1042 participants, moderate quality evidence) and reduced the amount of rehydration fluids required by 40% (ROM 0.60, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.68, 11 trials, 1201 participants, moderate quality evidence). The mean duration of fecal excretion of vibrios was reduced by almost three days (MD 2.74 days, 95% CI -3.07 to -2.40, 12 trials, 740 participants, moderate quality evidence). There was substantial heterogeneity in the size of these benefits, probably due to differences in the antibiotic used, the trial methods (particularly effective randomization), and the timing of outcome assessment. The benefits of antibiotics were seen both in trials recruiting only patients with severe dehydration and in those recruiting patients with mixed levels of dehydration. Comparisons of antimicrobials In head-to-head comparisons, there were no differences detected in diarrhoea duration or stool volume for tetracycline compared to doxycycline (three trials, 230 participants, very low quality evidence); or tetracycline compared to ciprofloxacin or norfloxacin (three trials, 259 participants, moderate quality evidence). In indirect comparisons with substantially more trials, tetracycline appeared to have larger benefits than doxycycline, norfloxacin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for the primary review outcomes. Single dose azithromycin shortened the duration of diarrhoea by over a day compared to ciprofloxacin (MD -32.43, 95% CI -62.90 to -1.95, two trials, 375 participants, moderate quality evidence) and by half a day compared to erythromycin (MD -12.05, 95% CI -22.02 to -2.08, two trials, 179 participants, moderate quality evidence). It was not compared with tetracycline.

Authors' Conclusions

In treating cholera, antimicrobials result in substantial improvements in clinical and microbiological outcomes, with similar effects observed in severely and non-severely ill patients. Azithromycin and tetracycline may have some advantages over other antibiotics.

Symptomatic relief — Ancillary treatment with antimotility, antinausea, or antiemetic agents can be considered once the patient is adequately hydrated, but their use is not a substitute for fluid and electrolyte therapy (weak, low). Antimotility drugs (eg, loperamide) should not be given to children < 18 years of age with acute diarrhea (strong, moderate). Loperamide may be given to immunocompetent adults with acute watery diarrhea (weak, moderate), but should be avoided at any age in suspected or proven cases where toxic megacolon may result in inflammatory diarrhea or diarrhea with fever (strong, low). Antinausea and antiemetic (eg, ondansetron) may be given to facilitate tolerance of oral rehydration in children > 4 years of age and in adolescents with acute gastroenteritis associated with vomiting (weak, moderate).

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Bacterial enteric infection in adults and adolescents with HIV — management of treatment failure and drug interactions: Follow-up stool culture should be considered for patients who fail to respond clinically to appropriate antimicrobial therapy, and persistent or recurrent diarrhea despite therapy should prompt consideration of other enteric infections and the possibility of C. difficile or antimicrobial resistance. Observational studies suggest plasma drug concentrations may be decreased with diarrhea or malabsorption; coadministration of quinolones with magnesium- or aluminum-containing antacids or with calcium, zinc, or iron should be avoided because these interfere with drug absorption, and it is prudent to use IV antibiotics in clinically unstable patients (AIII).

### Loperamide hydrochloride (imodium) [^114WStea]. FDA (2008). Low credibility.

Children under 2 Years

The use of IMODIUM in children under 2 years is not recommended. There have been rare reports of paralytic ileus associated with abdominal distention. Most of these reports occurred in the setting of acute dysentery, overdose, and with very young children less than two years of age.

Elderly

No formal pharmacokinetic studies were conducted in elderly subjects. However, there were no major differences reported in the drug disposition in elderly patients with diarrhea relative to young patients. No dosage adjustment is required in the elderly.

Renal Impairment

No pharmacokinetic data are available in patients with renal impairment. Since the metabolites and the unchanged drug are mainly excreted in the feces, no dosage adjustment is required for patients with renal impairment (see PRECAUTIONS section).

Hepatic Impairment

Although no pharmacokinetic data are available in patients with hepatic impairment, IMODIUM should be used with caution in such patients because of reduced first pass metabolism. (see Precautions).

Rifaximin chemoprophylaxis effectiveness — A systematic review/meta-analysis of rifaximin for TD prevention included four studies totaling 604 subjects, with dosing arms of rifaximin 200 mg once, two, or three times daily versus placebo, and found a pooled relative risk of 0.33 (95% CI: 0.24–0.45), equating to protective efficacy of 67% (95% CI: 55–76%) with heterogeneity χ2 = 3.90, P = 0.2737; I^2 = 3.1%. Absolute risk reduction estimates showed a mean decrease in TD attack rates of 22.1% (95% CI: 6.3–37.9%), equating to a number needed to treat of 4.5 (95% CI: 2.6–15.9). Two trials did not demonstrate a statistically significant benefit, and control-group TD incidence was relatively low at 8/48 or 17% and 9/47 or 19%, respectively.

### Prevalence of enteric infections in patients on immune checkpoint inhibitors and impact on management and outcomes [^1134oq8d]. The Oncologist (2024). Medium credibility.

The role of antibiotics in treating non- C. difficile gastrointestinal pathogens is another area of uncertainty and of particular interest in patients on immunotherapy, where the microbiome-disrupting effects of antibiotics have been suggested to increase the risk of and worsen outcomes in irEC. Antibiotic therapy for GI infections was not associated with changes in diarrhea severity, use of immunosuppressive therapy, steroid duration, hospitalization, symptom resolution, or OS in our landmark survival analysis but was linked to higher rates of diarrhea recurrence. These results are consistent with a previous study and support the potential for antibiotic-induced immune overactivity and autoimmunity against the native microbiome leading to decreased protection against recurrent diarrhea. That patients undergoing antibiotic therapy in our cohort had ICI treatment durations that were nearly 7 months shorter than those not receiving antibiotics echoes prior studies that have described associations of antibiotic-induced dysbiosis with increased risks of severe irEC, need for immunosuppressive therapy, and hospitalization. Our findings highlight the importance of avoiding unnecessary antibiotic regimens to reduce possible complications such as provoking more severe irEC courses, increasing the risk of diarrhea recurrence, and possibly leading to shorter duration of ICI therapy. As such, similar to avoiding unnecessary escalation of immunosuppressive therapies, increased antibiotic stewardship may improve patient outcomes and lower the downsides of over-treatment at an individual and population level. While the decision to prescribe antibiotics often considers numerous aspects of a patient's individualized illness presentation, the risks of exacerbating dysbiosis in patients with irEC and concomitant GI infections should be kept in mind while determining management options.

### High-dose probiotic mix ofspp., spp., andto prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhea in adults: a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (SPAADA) [^116SdAmH]. Open Forum Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

The study SPAADA was published by Vladimir Hodzhev and colleagues in 2024 in the journal Open Forum Infect Dis. This study is related to the following diseases: Clostridioides difficile infection. In the SPAADA study, the trial question was: what is the role of high-dose multi-strain probiotic mix for prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea in patients receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics? In the SPAADA study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the SPAADA study, the population was: 555 patients (346 female, 209 male). The inclusion criteria were patients receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics. The key exclusion criteria were antibiotic use in the past 60 days; daily consumption of probiotics, yogurt with probiotics, and inability to stop the consumption; an episode of diarrhea within 30 days before screening; prior infection of C. difficile ≤ 3 months before screening. In the SPAADA study, the interventions were: n = 282 probiotic mix (high-dose multi-strain probiotic mix [Sinquanon®] from the first dose of antibiotics until 14 days after the last antibiotic dose) n = 273 placebo (matching placebo from the first dose of antibiotics until 14 days after the last antibiotic dose). In the SPAADA study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in antibiotic-associated diarrhea (9.2% vs. 25.3%; RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.55). In the SPAADA study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in mild antibiotic-associated diarrhea (8.2% vs. 16.8%; RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.8) No significant difference in the rate of antibiotic-associated diarrhea ≥ 6 days (11.5% vs. 21.6%; RR 0.53, 95% CI -0.39 to 1.45) Significant decrease in abdominal pain (18.1% vs. 36.6%; RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.66). In the SPAADA study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in adverse events and serious adverse events. In the SPAADA study, the conclusion was: in patients receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, probiotic mix was superior to placebo with respect to a antibiotic-associated diarrhea.

### Common questions about Clostridium difficile infection [^111p1LEb]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Clostridium difficile infection is a common cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea. It causes no symptoms in more than one-half of infected patients, but can also cause a wide spectrum of illnesses and death. The incidence and severity have increased in recent years. The most important modifiable risk factor for C. difficile infection is antibiotic exposure; this risk is dose-related and higher with longer courses and combination therapy. C. difficile infection is also associated with older age, recent hospitalization, multiple comorbidities, use of gastric acid blockers, inflammatory bowel disease, and immunosuppression. It has become more common in younger, healthier patients in community settings. The most practical testing options are rapid testing with nucleic acid amplification or enzyme immunoassays to detect toxin, or a two-step strategy. Treatment includes discontinuing the contributing antibiotic, if possible. Mild C. difficile infection should be treated with oral metronidazole; severe infection should be treated with oral vancomycin. Fidaxomicin may be an effective alternative. Recurrences of the infection should be treated based on severity. Tapering and the pulsed-dose method of oral vancomycin therapy for second recurrences are effective. Prevention includes responsible antibiotic prescribing and vigilant handwashing. Probiotics prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhea, but are not recommended specifically for preventing C. difficile infection.

Enteric infections in people with HIV — antibiotic absorption and administration: Observational studies suggest that plasma drug concentrations may be decreased due to severe diarrhea or malabsorption, coadministration of fluoroquinolones with magnesium- or aluminum-containing antacids or with calcium, zinc, or iron should be avoided because these agents interfere with fluoroquinolone absorption (AII), and it is prudent to use IV antibiotics in clinically unstable patients (AIII). Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome has not been described in association with treatment for typical bacterial enteric pathogens.

### Loperamide hydrochloride (imodium) [^11624SxF]. FDA (2008). Low credibility.

General

Extremely rare allergic reactions including anaphylaxis and anaphylactic shock have been reported. In acute diarrhea, if clinical improvement is not observed in 48 hours, the administration of IMODIUM®(loperamide hydrochloride) should be discontinued and patients should be advised to consult their physician. Although no pharmacokinetic data are available in patients with hepatic impairment, IMODIUM should be used with caution in such patients because of reduced first pass metabolism. Patients with hepatic dysfunction should be monitored closely for signs of CNS toxicity. No pharmacokinetic data are available in patients with renal impairment. Since it has been reported that the majority of the drug is metabolized and metabolites or the unchanged drug is excreted mainly in the feces, dosage adjustments in patients with renal impairment are not required. No formal studies have been conducted to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of loperamide in elderly subjects. However, in two studies that enrolled elderly patients, there were no major differences in the drug disposition in elderly patients with diarrhea relative to young patients.

Information for Patients

Patients should be advised to check with their physician if their diarrhea does not improve in 48 hours or if they note blood in their stools, develop a fever or develop abdominal distention. Tiredness, dizziness, or drowsiness may occur in the setting of diarrheal syndromes treated with IMODIUM. Therefore, it is advisable to use caution when driving a car or operating machinery. (see Adverse Reactions).

Drug Interactions

Nonclinical data have shown that loperamide is a P-glycoprotein substrate. Concomitant administration of loperamide (16 mg single dose) with a 600 mg single dose of either quinidine, or ritonavir, both of which are P-glycoprotein inhibitors, resulted in a 2- to 3- fold increase in loperamide plasma levels. Due to the potential for enhanced central effects when loperamide is coadministered with quinidine and with ritonavir, caution should be exercised when loperamide is administered at the recommended dosages (2 mg, up to 16 mg maximum daily dose) with P-glycoprotein inhibitors.

When a single 16-mg dose of loperamide is coadministered with a 600 mg single dose of saquinavir, loperamide decreased saquinavir exposure by 54%, which may be of clinical relevance due to reduction of therapeutic efficacy of saquinavir. The effect of saquinavir on loperamide is of less clinical significance. Therefore, when loperamide is given with saquinavir, the therapeutic efficacy of saquinavir should be closely monitored.

### ACG clinical guidelines: prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of Clostridioides difficile infections [^111TsenT]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

CDI symptomatic and adjunctive therapies — antimotility agents and bile acid–binding agents: Based on these data, antimotility agents should be avoided in untreated CDI and in patients with fulminant infection; however, once patients have initiated anti-CDI therapy, they can be used safely on an as-needed basis. Cholestyramine or other bile acid–binding agents are sometimes given with anti-CDI therapy, but there is a paucity of evidence to support these claims, and administration together with vancomycin is contraindicated because of drug–drug interactions, specifically the potential to bind antibiotics; therefore, they should not be used as monotherapy or concurrently with anti-CDI therapy. The addition of psyllium husk as a bulking agent may help diarrheal symptoms when given during the recovery phase.

### Effect of bismuth subsalicylate vs placebo on use of antibiotics among adult outpatients with diarrhea in Pakistan: a randomized clinical trial [^114s3WYf]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

The World Health Organization has declared antimicrobial resistance a global crisis. Inappropriate use of antibiotics, an important driver of antibiotic resistance, is common globally. Although acute respiratory infections are the primary condition for which antibiotics are prescribed inappropriately in the United States, globally, many of the estimated 4.5 billion annual episodes of diarrhea are inappropriately treated with antibiotics. In South Asia, most ambulatory patients with acute diarrhea may be treated with antibiotics, often in conflict with national practice guidelines, and the prevalence of multidrug resistance among enteric pathogens is high. Antibiotic resistance can lead to treatment dilemmas and increased morbidity and mortality among infected populations and rapidly spread worldwide through globalized markets and frequent international travel.,

Optimization of antibiotic use is a primary strategy in the global action plan on antibiotic resistance; however, traditional stewardship efforts have had limited success. Evidence suggests that patients and health care professionals can be redirected toward nonantibiotic medications to satisfy the desire to actively treat the illness, relieve symptoms, and permit the patient to return to work and other activities sooner. For example, among children given oral rehydration therapy for diarrhea, adding zinc to the treatment regimen led to decreased antibiotic use. Because many adult patients with diarrhea in Pakistan are treated with antibiotics, but zinc is not indicated for adult patients with diarrhea, other nonantibiotic medications that relieve symptoms may help reduce inappropriate use of antibiotics. Bismuth subsalicylate (BSS), a generic, nonprescription antidiarrheal with mild, local antimicrobial activity, can reduce the duration of gastrointestinal symptoms among children and adults with diarrhea. We studied the effect of BSS on use of systemic antibiotics for acute diarrhea among adult outpatients in Pakistan.

### Effect of bismuth subsalicylate vs placebo on use of antibiotics among adult outpatients with diarrhea in Pakistan: a randomized clinical trial [^1166pJ87]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Among adults with diarrhea, does use of bismuth subsalicylate reduce antibiotic consumption?

Findings

In this placebo-controlled randomized trial that included 439 adults in Pakistan, antibiotic use occurred among 16% of participants who received placebo and 9% of those who received bismuth subsalicylate, a significant difference.

Meaning

The findings suggest that recommending bismuth subsalicylate as a frontline treatment for adults with diarrhea, including for diarrhea self-management, may reduce rates of unnecessary antibiotic use and help modulate the spread of antibiotic resistance.

### Probiotics for the prevention of pediatric antibiotic-associated diarrhea [^1149No1w]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Antibiotics alter the microbial balance commonly resulting in antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD). Probiotics may prevent AAD via providing gut barrier, restoration of the gut microflora, and other potential mechanisms of action.

Objectives

The primary objectives were to assess the efficacy and safety of probiotics (any specified strain or dose) used for the prevention of AAD in children.

Search Methods

MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, CINAHL, and the Web of Science (inception to 28 May 2018) were searched along with registers including the ISRCTN and Clinicaltrials.gov. We also searched the NICE Evidence Services database as well as reference lists from relevant articles.

Selection Criteria

Randomized, parallel, controlled trials in children (0 to 18 years) receiving antibiotics, that compare probiotics to placebo, active alternative prophylaxis, or no treatment and measure the incidence of diarrhea secondary to antibiotic use were considered for inclusion.

Data Collection and Analysis

Study selection, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment were conducted independently by two authors. Dichotomous data (incidence of AAD, adverse events) were combined using a pooled risk ratio (RR) or risk difference (RD), and continuous data (mean duration of diarrhea) as mean difference (MD), along with corresponding 95% confidence interval (95% CI). We calculated the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) where appropriate. For studies reporting on microbiome characteristics using heterogeneous outcomes, we describe the results narratively. The certainty of the evidence was evaluated using GRADE.

Main Results

Thirty-three studies (6352 participants) were included. Probiotics assessed included Bacillus spp. Bifidobacterium spp. Clostridium butyricum, Lactobacilli spp. Lactococcus spp. Leuconostoc cremoris, Saccharomyces spp., orStreptococcus spp., alone or in combination. The risk of bias was determined to be high in 20 studies and low in 13 studies. Complete case (patients who did not complete the studies were not included in the analysis) results from 33 trials reporting on the incidence of diarrhea show a precise benefit from probiotics compared to active, placebo or no treatment control. After 5 days to 12 weeks of follow-up, the incidence of AAD in the probiotic group was 8% (259/3232) compared to 19% (598/3120) in the control group (RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.56; I² = 57%, 6352 participants; NNTB 9, 95% CI 7 to 13; moderate certainty evidence). Nineteen studies had loss to follow-up ranging from 1% to 46%. After making assumptions for those lost, the observed benefit was still statistically significant using an extreme plausible intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis, wherein the incidence of AAD in the probiotic group was 12% (436/3551) compared to 19% (664/3468) in the control group (7019 participants; RR 0.61; 95% CI 0.49 to 0.77; P < 0.00001; I² = 70%). An a priori available case subgroup analysis exploring heterogeneity indicated that high dose (≥ 5 billion CFUs per day) is more effective than low probiotic dose (< 5 billion CFUs per day), interaction P value = 0.01. For the high dose studies the incidence of AAD in the probiotic group was 8% (162/2029) compared to 23% (462/2009) in the control group (4038 participants; RR 0.37; 95% CI 0.30 to 0.46; P = 0.06; moderate certainty evidence). For the low dose studies the incidence of AAD in the probiotic group was 8% (97/1155) compared to 13% (133/1059) in the control group (2214 participants; RR 0.68; 95% CI 0.46 to 1.01; P = 0.02). Again, assumptions for loss to follow-up using an extreme plausible ITT analysis was statistically significant. For high dose studies the incidence of AAD in the probiotic group was 13% (278/2218) compared to 23% (503/2207) in control group (4425 participants; RR 0.54; 95% CI 0.42 to 0.70; P < 0.00001; I² = 68%; moderate certainty evidence). None of the 24 trials (4415 participants) that reported on adverse events reported any serious adverse events attributable to probiotics. Adverse event rates were low. After 5 days to 4 weeks follow-up, 4% (86/2229) of probiotics participants had an adverse event compared to 6% (121/2186) of control participants (RD 0.00; 95% CI -0.01 to 0.01; P < 0.00001; I² = 75%; low certainty evidence). Common adverse events included rash, nausea, gas, flatulence, abdominal bloating, and constipation. After 10 days to 12 weeks of follow-up, eight studies recorded data on our secondary outcome, the mean duration of diarrhea; with probiotics reducing diarrhea duration by almost one day (MD -0.91; 95% CI -1.38 to -0.44; P < 0.00001; low certainty evidence). One study reported on microbiome characteristics, reporting no difference in changes with concurrent antibiotic and probiotic use.

Authors' Conclusions

The overall evidence suggests a moderate protective effect of probiotics for preventing AAD (NNTB 9, 95% CI 7 to 13). Using five criteria to evaluate the credibility of the subgroup analysis on probiotic dose, the results indicate the subgroup effect based on high dose probiotics (≥ 5 billion CFUs per day) was credible. Based on high-dose probiotics, the NNTB to prevent one case of diarrhea is 6 (95% CI 5 to 9). The overall certainty of the evidence for the primary endpoint, incidence of AAD based on high dose probiotics was moderate due to the minor issues with risk of bias and inconsistency related to a diversity of probiotic agents used. Evidence also suggests that probiotics may moderately reduce the duration of diarrhea, a reduction by almost one day. The benefit of high dose probiotics (e.g. Lactobacillus rhamnosus orSaccharomyces boulardii) needs to be confirmed by a large well-designed multi-centered randomized trial. It is premature to draw firm conclusions about the efficacy and safety of 'other' probiotic agents as an adjunct to antibiotics in children. Adverse event rates were low and no serious adverse events were attributable to probiotics. Although no serious adverse events were observed among inpatient and outpatient children, including small studies conducted in the intensive care unit and in the neonatal unit, observational studies not included in this review have reported serious adverse events in severely debilitated or immuno-compromised children with underlying risk factors including central venous catheter use and disorders associated with bacterial/fungal translocation.

### Antibiotic-prescribing practices for management of childhood diarrhea in 3 sub-saharan African countries: findings from the vaccine impact on diarrhea in Africa (VIDA) study, 2015–2018 [^114WjGSR]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Our findings indicate that nonadherence to IMCI guidelines for treatment of diarrhea is prevalent at the study sites in sub-Saharan Africa, manifesting as prescription of antibiotics that are ineffective or unnecessary, or not prescribing antibiotics when they are indicated. Overall, 88% of children with dysentery were prescribed antibiotics, but only 59% of them received the recommended first-line therapy with ciprofloxacin. In addition, 77% of MSD cases who had no apparent indication for therapy were prescribed antibiotics. Unindicated antibiotic prescription was associated with specific clinical features, which varied somewhat from site to site, suggesting that cross-cutting antimicrobial stewardship is needed that is informed by local clinical practices.

Overall, most children with watery diarrhea in The Gambia (58%) and Mali (98%) and 25% in Kenya received an antibiotic that the guidelines deemed unnecessary, corroborating results from other studies indicating the widespread nature of this problem in primary care across low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), with some variation in the frequency and predisposing factors by country. In many instances when antibiotics were prescribed without an apparent indication, a drug was selected that has limited utility for diarrheal pathogens. For example, metronidazole was prescribed for nonbloody diarrhea in approximately 28% of episodes in The Gambia and Kenya and 77% in Mali. Metronidazole is not indicated for pediatric diarrhea unless the child has dysentery that fails to improve with antibiotics directed against shigellosis, and it is not without adverse reactions. Inappropriate prescription of cotrimoxazole was also common at all sites among children with watery diarrhea. The indication for empiric treatment with cotrimoxazole is limited to dysentery, and because resistance is now widespread, it should only be given when susceptibility is known or expected based on local data. Future studies should explore these drivers of decisions on antibiotic prescription to support the development of effective strategies that encourage appropriate, effective, affordable, evidence-based, guideline-driven antibiotics use for management of diarrheal diseases.

### A practical guide for probiotics applied to the case of antibiotic-associated diarrhea in the Netherlands [^113TEvWy]. BMC Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Antibiotic associated diarrhea (AAD)

The use of antibiotics is associated with a variety of side-effects. The most common side effects are gastro-intestinal, such as nausea and diarrhea (Additional file 1). Antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) arises when the antibiotic disrupts the ecology of the intestinal microbiota, by altering the diversity and numbers of bacteria in the gut. These changes can affect the capacity of the resident microbiota to resist the invasion of pathogenic microorganisms or the overgrowth of opportunistic pathogens species that are endogenously present in the microbiota. Even after the recovery of total bacterial counts, there can be long-lasting effects on the balance of the intestinal microbiota and consequently on the patient's susceptibility to infection and other diseases. Therefore, AAD may result in prolonged hospitalization, increased health care costs and other complications. Diarrhea is most frequently associated with the use of broad spectrum antibiotics, and a tendency to an increase in the prescriptions of broad-spectrum antibiotics has been observed even in a low-prescribing country like the Netherlands (Fig. 1). For example, the broad-spectrum antibiotic amoxicillin is one of the top 25 drugs that have increased in the numbers of prescriptions in 2015. Therefore, it is important to consider the methods currently used to contrast the incidence of AAD and to evaluate their efficacy.

### A practical guide for probiotics applied to the case of antibiotic-associated diarrhea in the Netherlands [^112Pwbaq]. BMC Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) is a side-effect frequently associated with the use of broad spectrum antibiotics. Although a number of clinical studies show that co-administration of specific probiotics reduces the risk for AAD, there is still unclarity among healthcare professionals on the recommendation of probiotic products. This paper aims at a practical guide to inform healthcare professionals, patients and consumers about the exact product characteristics of available probiotics with a proven efficacy to prevent AAD.

Methods

The workflow in this paper includes three consecutive steps: 1) systematic review of relevant clinical studies for effective probiotics by a meta-analysis, 2) compilation of a list of available probiotic products, and 3) recommendation of probiotic products that match effective formulations. Our systematic review on the efficacy of probiotics for the prevention of AAD included only studies with randomized, double blind placebo-controlled trials, a clear definition of antibiotic associated diarrhea, and a probiotic administration regime for at least the duration of the antibiotic therapy.

Results

Using our inclusion criteria, we selected 32 out of 128 identified trials and pooled the results of these studies for each specific dairy product and food supplement. The results indicate a total of seven single or multiple-strain formulations favoring the probiotic treatment group, with the strain Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG being the most effective [relative risk ratio of probiotic versus placebo 0.30 (95% CI 0.16–0.5)]. We selected products for recommendation from a compiled list of all probiotic dairy products and food supplements available in The Netherlands and categorized them into groups of products showing effects against the incidence of AAD in at least one, two or three independent clinical studies. We excluded all products which did not unambiguously declare on the label the specific probiotic strain(s) and the number of colony forming units.

Conclusion

Here we present a practical guide that informs healthcare professionals and patients on the availability of probiotic products with a proven efficacy for the prevention of AAD.

### ACG clinical guideline: diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of acute diarrheal infections in adults [^1164A9pt]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016). Medium credibility.

ACG Clinical Guideline — treatment of acute disease: The usage of balanced electrolyte rehydration over other oral rehydration options in the elderly with severe diarrhea or any traveler with cholera-like watery diarrhea is recommended. The use of probiotics or prebiotics for the treatment of acute diarrhea in adults is not recommended, except in cases of postantibiotic-associated illness. Bismuth subsalicylates can be administered to control rates of passage of stool and may help travelers function better during bouts of mild-to-moderate illness. In patients receiving antibiotics for traveler's diarrhea, adjunctive loperamide therapy should be administered to decrease duration of diarrhea and increase chance for a cure. The evidence does not support empiric anti-microbial therapy for routine acute diarrheal infection, except in cases of traveler's diarrhea (TD) where the likelihood of bacterial pathogens is high enough to justify the potential side effects of antibiotics.

### Therapy of acute gastroenteritis: role of antibiotics [^1114Yef4]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2015). Low credibility.

Acute infectious diarrhoea remains a very common health problem, even in the industrialized world. One of the dilemmas in assessing patients with acute diarrhoea is deciding when to test for aetiological agents and when to initiate antimicrobial therapy. The management and therapy of acute gastroenteritis is discussed in two epidemiological settings: community-acquired diarrhoea and travellers' diarrhoea. Antibiotic therapy is not required in most patients with acute gastroenteritis, because the illness is usually self-limiting. Antimicrobial therapy can also lead to adverse events, and unnecessary treatments add to resistance development. Nevertheless, empirical antimicrobial therapy can be necessary in certain situations, such as patients with febrile diarrhoeal illness, with fever and bloody diarrhoea, symptoms persisting for > 1 week, or immunocompromised status.

### Who are susceptible to pseudomembranous colitis among patients with presumed antibiotic-associated diarrhea? [^111oNqdy]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose

Pseudomembranous colitis is a severe form of antibiotic-associated diarrhea. However, there have been no reports about the factors that make patients with presumed antibiotic-associated diarrhea susceptible to pseudomembranous colitis. This study was designed to determine the clinical risk factors for pseudomembranous colitis among the patients with presumed antibiotic-associated diarrhea.

Methods

This was a retrospective study of 150 consecutive patients admitted to our institution between January 2000 and December 2004 with a diagnosis of presumed antibiotic-associated diarrhea. All patients underwent sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy because of diarrhea after administration of antibiotics. Pseudomembranous colitis was confirmed both endoscopically and histologically. Various clinical parameters were compared between the pseudomembranous colitis group and non-pseudomembranous colitis group.

Results

The mean age of patients was 61 years, and 60 percent (90/150) was female. Pseudomembranous colitis was diagnosed in 53 percent (80/150). On univariate analysis, older than aged 70 years (P = 0.014), antibiotic therapy for more than 15 days (P < 0.0001), hospital stay for more than 20 days (P < 0.0001), number of antibiotics used more than one (P = 0.01), and surgical procedures (P = 0.029) were significant parameters for pseudomembranous colitis. On multivariate analysis, the important clinical risk factors were advanced age (older than aged 70 years; adjusted odds ratio, 2.7; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.208–6.131; P < 0.016) and long hospital stay (more than 20 days; adjusted odds ratio, 5.1; 95 percent confidence interval, 2.1–12.259; P < 0.0001). When both risk factors were present, the positive predictive value of pseudomembranous colitis was 0.86.

Conclusions

Advanced age and long hospital stay may make patients with presumed antibiotic-associated diarrhea susceptible to pseudomembranous colitis. Therefore, pseudomembranous colitis should be first suspected in cases with presumed antibiotic-associated diarrhea having such risk factors.

### Recommended guidelines for the treatment of cancer treatment-induced diarrhea [^117E3WVW]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose

To update and expand on previously published clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of cancer treatment-induced diarrhea.

Methods

An expert multidisciplinary panel was convened to review the recent literature and discuss recommendations for updating the practice guidelines previously published by this group in the Journal of Clinical Oncology in 1998. MEDLINE searches were performed and the relevant literature published since 1998 was reviewed by all panel members. The treatment recommendations and algorithm were revised by panel consensus.

Results

A recent review of early toxic deaths occurring in two National Cancer Institute-sponsored cooperative group trials of irinotecan plus high-dose fluorouracil and leucovorin for advanced colorectal cancer has led to the recognition of a life-threatening gastrointestinal syndrome and highlighted the need for vigilant monitoring and aggressive therapy for this serious complication. Loperamide remains the standard therapy for uncomplicated cases. However, the revised guidelines reflect the need for recognition of the early warning signs of complicated cases of diarrhea and the need for early and aggressive management, including the addition of antibiotics. Management of radiation-induced diarrhea is similar but may not require hospitalization, and chronic low- to intermediate-grade symptoms can be managed with continued loperamide.

Conclusion

With vigilant monitoring and aggressive therapy for cancer treatment-induced diarrhea, particularly in patients with early warning signs of severe complications, morbidity and mortality may be reduced.

### Effect of bismuth subsalicylate vs placebo on use of antibiotics among adult outpatients with diarrhea in Pakistan: a randomized clinical trial [^1168AR5S]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Conclusions

Effects of interventions to reduce inappropriate antibiotic use are likely to vary by illness and setting; however, we found lower odds of antibiotic use following BSS for acute diarrhea in a setting where antibiotic use for diarrhea is typically high. This effect size approaches the goal of 50% reduction in inappropriate antibiotic use in outpatient settings set in the United States Action Plan for Combatting Antimicrobial Resistance. Because of the challenges inherent in developing new classes of antibiotic medications, and because increased population density and mixing and decreased travel times facilitate the spread of antibiotic resistance, preserving the function of the limited number of existing drugs is critical. In Pakistan, more than half of adults with diarrhea may seek care from a physician. Encouraging health care professionals and pharmacists in settings with high diarrhea incidence to recommend BSS as frontline treatment for adults with diarrhea, and promoting BSS for diarrhea self-management, may reduce antibiotic use and rates of antibiotic resistance globally.

### A review of Clostridioides difficile infection and antibiotic-associated diarrhea [^116D3h9u]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Antibiotic-associated diarrhea and Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) occur frequently among adults. The pathophysiology of CDI is related to disruption of normal gut flora and risk factors include hospitalization, use of antibiotic therapy, and older age. Clinical manifestations can range from mild disease to toxic megacolon. Diagnosis is challenging and is based on a combination of clinical symptoms and diagnostic tests. Therapy includes cessation of antibiotics, or use of other agents depending on the severity of illness. Many novel agents for the treatment and prevention of CDI show promise and are under investigation.

### Colistimethate sodium (colistimethate) [^116JL4Sx]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

WARNINGS

Maximum daily dose calculated from colistin base activity should not exceed 5 mg/kg/day with normal renal function.

Transient neurological disturbances may occur. These include circumoral paresthesia or numbness, tingling or formication of the extremities, generalized pruritus, vertigo, dizziness, and slurring of speech. For these reasons, patients should be warned not to drive vehicles or use hazardous machinery while on therapy. Reduction of dosage may alleviate symptoms. Therapy need not be discontinued, but such patients should be observed with particular care.

Nephrotoxicity can occur and is probably a dosedependent effect of colistimethate sodium. These manifestations of nephrotoxicity are reversible following discontinuation of the antibiotic.

Overdosage can result in renal insufficiency, muscle weakness, and apnea (see OVERDOSAGE section). See PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions subsection for use concomitantly with other antibiotics and curariform drugs.

Respiratory arrest has been reported following intramuscular administration of colistimethate sodium. Impaired renal function increases the possibility of apnea and neuromuscular blockade following administration of colistimethate sodium. Therefore, it is important to follow recommended dosing guidelines. See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION section for use in renal impairment.

Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including Colistimethate for Injection, USP and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile.

C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents.

If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.

### Diarrhoea in adults (acute) [^1167Lwke]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2011). Medium credibility.

Introduction

An estimated 4.6 billion cases of diarrhoea occurred worldwide in 2004, resulting in 2.2 million deaths.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatments for acute diarrhoea in adults living in resource-rich countries? What are the effects of treatments for acute mild-to-moderate diarrhoea in adults from resource-rich countries travelling to resource-poor countries? What are the effects of treatments for acute mild-to-moderate diarrhoea in adults living in resource-poor countries? What are the effects of treatments for acute severe diarrhoea in adults living in resource-poor countries? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to January 2010 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 72 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: antibiotics, antimotility agents, antisecretory agents, bismuth subsalicylate, diet, intravenous rehydration, nasogastric tube rehydration, oral rehydration solutions (amino acid oral rehydration solution, bicarbonate oral rehydration solution, reduced osmolarity oral rehydration solution, rice-based oral rehydration solution, standard oral rehydration solution), vitamin A supplementation, and zinc supplementation.

### Effect of 3 days of oral azithromycin on young children with acute diarrhea in low-resource settings: a randomized clinical trial [^115bcyb3]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Does the addition of azithromycin to the standard case management of acute watery diarrhea for children aged 2 to 23 months who are dehydrated or undernourished reduce mortality and improve linear growth?

Findings

This randomized clinical trial of 8266 children was unable to detect a survival benefit for children from the addition of azithromycin to the standard World Health Organization (WHO) case management of acute watery diarrhea in low-resource settings.

Meaning

In low-resource settings, adherence to current WHO case management protocols for watery diarrhea remains appropriate; antibiotic use is not warranted.

Recommended antimicrobial agents by pathogen — Vibrio species and Yersinia: Vibrio cholerae — first choice doxycycline, with alternatives ciprofloxacin, azithromycin, or ceftriaxone; a footnote adds "Primary therapy is aggressive rehydration; antibiotics are adjunctive therapy". A separate footnote states, "If invasive disease is suspected or confirmed, ceftriaxone is preferred over ciprofloxacin due to increasing resistance to ciprofloxacin". Non–Vibrio cholerae — antibiotics are usually not indicated for noninvasive disease; if treated, single-agent therapy can be used, while invasive disease calls for ceftriaxone plus doxycycline, with alternatives of TMP-SMX (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) plus an aminoglycoside. Yersinia enterocolitica — first choice TMP-SMX; alternatives cefotaxime or ciprofloxacin.

Certainty of evidence and grading — the risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk-of-Bias Tool for RCTs and the certainty of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach. Evidence from RCTs starts at high certainty, and evidence derived from observational studies starts at low certainty; for each outcome, the evidence is graded as high, moderate, low, or very low. The evidence can be rated down for risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias, and can be rated up for large magnitude of effect or dose–response relationship. Judgments about the certainty of evidence were determined via consensus and an overall judgment of certainty of evidence was made for each PICO.

### Pharmacologic management of diarrhea in patients with short bowel syndrome [^115HWbCh]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2014). Low credibility.

Diarrhea associated with short bowel syndrome (SBS) can have multiple etiologies, including accelerated intestinal transit, gastric acid hypersecretion, intestinal bacterial overgrowth, and malabsorption of fats and bile salts. As a result, patients may need multiple medications to effectively control fecal output. The armamentarium of antidiarrheal drugs includes antimotility agents, antisecretory drugs, antibiotics and probiotics, bile acid-binding resins, and pancreatic enzymes. An antidiarrheal regimen must be individualized for each patient and should be developed using a methodical, stepwise approach. Treatment should be initiated with a single first-line medication at the low end of its dosing range. Dosage and/or dosing frequency can then be slowly escalated to achieve maximal effect while minimizing adverse events. If diarrhea remains poorly controlled, additional agents can be incorporated sequentially. If modification of the regimen is required, a single medication should be altered or exchanged at a time. After each adjustment of the regimen, sufficient time should be permitted to fully assess response (≥ 3–5 days) before initiating additional changes. SBS-associated malabsorption is a major obstacle to optimization of an antidiarrheal regimen because drug absorption is impaired. Patients may benefit from high dosages and/or frequent dosing intervals, liquid preparations, or nonoral routes of drug delivery. Although the diarrhea associated with SBS can be debilitating, effective pharmaceutical management has the potential to substantially improve health outcomes and quality of life for these patients.

RESULTS

Eligible Studies

A systematic search conducted in February 2020 identified 1789 citations (PubMed 204, Cochrane Library 439, EMBASE 533, and Web of Science 613). Of these studies, 36 RCTs–with 9312 subjects met the inclusion criteria (35 published in English and one in Spanish). Details of the search flow are depicted in Figure 1. The probiotics species studied in the trials primarily included Lactobacillus, Saccharomyces, Bifidobacterium, and Streptococcus. Probiotics were used at the same time as antibiotics or were prolonged by 2 to 28 days after the therapy. Diarrhea was defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) criterion in 8 studies (≥ 3 loose stools within a 24-h period). Six studies applied an adjusted WHO criterion (≥ 3 loose or liquid stools/day for at least 2 d). Other RCTs defined diarrhea based on the number of bowel movements per day and the consistency of the stool. Table 1 summarizes the details of participants and intervention.

Quality Assessment

The quality assessment results are shown in Figure 2, whereas Figure 3 displays the risk of bias of individual study. Among the eligible studies, 13 RCTs were triple-blinded, and the reminders were not clearly reported about the detection bias. Attrition bias and other biases were assessed to be higher for lacking an intention-to-treat analysis (11/36), excessive or unbalanced loss of follow-up (6/36), funding bias (4/36), small sample size (3/36), unbalanced baseline (3/36), or short follow-up period (1/36).

### Effect of bismuth subsalicylate vs placebo on use of antibiotics among adult outpatients with diarrhea in Pakistan: a randomized clinical trial [^113Xt5vt]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Limitations

This study has limitations. By offering an alternative medication during the clinical encounter, we redirected patients in both study groups away from antibiotics. This nudge likely reduced antibiotic use in both study groups: effort required to obtain antibiotics increased because they were not provided during the initial clinic visit; meanwhile, because diarrhea symptoms often wane naturally within 1 to 2 days of onset, participant motivation to obtain antibiotics likely decreased while they tried the study medication. Indeed, a Cochrane reviewconcluded that, when safe to do so, withholding antibiotics yields greater reduction in antibiotic use while maintaining patient satisfaction and rates of favorable clinical outcomes compared with providing delayed prescriptions. In our study, the proportion of participants using antibiotics was lower than we anticipated: 34 (16%) of patients in the placebo group used antibiotics, compared with 96% of Pakistani children who presented for care for diarrhea at a private clinic in one studyand 46% of Pakistani children with diarrhea, whether or not they presented for care, in another. Thus, we likely would have observed a larger relative reduction in antibiotic use had we not controlled antibiotic use at enrollment in the placebo group. Despite this, compared with controls, substantially fewer participants in the BSS group used antibiotics.

The drivers of this relative reduction are unclear. Although previous studies have found reduced duration and severity of symptoms among children and young adults given BSS for diarrhea, we did not detect reductions in diarrhea output or time to resolution of abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting in this study. This may be because we relied on participants to record numbers and timing of diarrheal episodes and other symptoms rather than hospitalizing participants to obtain more objective and systematic measurements, or because our study population experienced a wider range of diarrheal etiologies. Nonetheless, additional outcome measures suggest that participants in the control group felt less well than those in the BSS group during follow-up. In addition to taking antibiotics more often, participants in the control group were significantly more likely to receive intravenous rehydration, and they missed more work. Although results did not attain statistical significance, such participants were also less likely to report participation in all their typical activities during the first 2 days of follow-up and more likely to take nonantibiotic medications or supplements for their illness, with antidiarrheal medications being the most commonly reported. The additional treatments used in the placebo group might have obscured differences in illness course between the study groups.

### Impact of antibiotic therapy on the development and response to treatment of immune checkpoint inhibitor-mediated diarrhea and colitis [^113f6XBj]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

Overview of antibiotic therapy

Of the 826 study patients, 569 (68.9%) received antibiotic therapy (Table 1). Of these 569 patients, 299 (52.5%) received antibiotics both before and after initiation of ICI therapy, 186 (32.7%) received antibiotics before initiation of ICI therapy only, and 84 (14.8%) received antibiotics after initiation of ICI therapy only. Empirical use of antibiotic without an identifiable source was the most common indication for antibiotic use, followed by prophylactic use without signs of infection (Additional file 1: Table S4). Overall, patients who received antibiotics had lower IMDC occurrence (p < 0.001) and recurrence (p = 0.025) rates than did patients without antibiotic exposure (Table 2). However, more IMDC patients who received antibiotics needed hospitalization (p < 0.001) or ICU admission (p = 0.038) or had severe colitis (p = 0.022) than did patients who did not receive antibiotics.

Table 2
Clinical features of the study patients according to use of antibiotic therapy

Of the patients given antibiotics, 51% received antibiotics with anaerobic activity. When we compared the patients given anaerobic and aerobic antibiotic agents, we noticed that anaerobic antibiotic therapy was associated with increased rates of hospitalization (p < 0.001) and ICU admission for IMDC (p = 0.002), IMDC grade (p = 0.004), and requirement of immunosuppressive therapy (p = 0.03) (Table 3).

Table 3
Clinical features of patients who received anaerobic and aerobic antibiotic therapy (No. of patients who received antibiotic = 569)

Patients who received anti-CTLA-4

Additional file 1: Table S5. A summarizes the clinical features of patients who received antibiotics. The rate of IMDC was lower in patients who received antibiotic therapy compared with those who did not (p = 0.002). Moreover, antibiotic use was associated with more frequent hospitalizations (p < 0.001) and higher grades of colitis (p = 0.011). Antibiotics with anaerobic activity were associated with higher rates of IMDC (p = 0.021), more frequent requirement for immunosuppressive therapy (p = 0.014), more frequent hospitalizations (p = 0.002), higher grades of colitis (p = 0.009), and higher levels of fecal calprotectin (p = 0.010) (Additional file 1: Table S5.B).

### 2017 Infectious Diseases Society of America clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of infectious diarrhea [^117NPL7v]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

Infectious diarrhea — empiric antimicrobial therapy for acute and persistent watery diarrhea is generally discouraged: in most people with acute watery diarrhea and without recent international travel, empiric antimicrobial therapy is not recommended (strong, low), with an exception that may be made in people who are ill-appearing, and empiric treatment should be avoided in people with persistent watery diarrhea lasting 14 days or more (strong, low). Asymptomatic contacts of people with acute or persistent watery diarrhea should not be offered empiric or preventive therapy, but should be advised to follow appropriate infection prevention and control measures (strong, moderate). Features suggesting inflammatory infection that warrant investigation include high fever, significant abdominal pain, and duration > 3 days, and given the relatively small benefit of empiric treatment (1 day shorter illness on average) and the likelihood of viral infection in the absence of inflammatory signs, empiric treatment cannot be recommended and may be potentially harmful.

### Infection in cancer patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors [^115BFyWN]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionized cancer treatment, but are associated with immune-mediated diarrhea and colitis (IMDC). Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) can cause infectious diarrhea with overlapping symptoms. Thus, we sought to elucidate the characteristics of CDI in patients treated with ICI, in the context of IMDC.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective, single-center study of adult cancer patients (N = 421) with ICI exposure from 2015–2020 and a positive stool nucleic acid amplification test and/or enzyme immunoassay for CDI. Baseline characteristics, treatments, and outcomes were compared between patients with and without concurrent IMDC.

Results

Forty-one eligible patients were included, 27 with concurrent IMDC and 14 without. Twenty-seven patients were taking programmed death-1 or its ligand inhibitors and 14 were taking cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 inhibitors. Patients with concurrent CDI and IMDC had a longer symptom duration (20 vs. 5 days, P = 0.003) and a higher rate of grade 3–4 diarrhea (41% vs. 7%, P = 0.033). Among patients with concurrent IMDC, preceding antibiotics (P = 0.050) and proton pump inhibitors (PPI) (P = 0.038) were used more frequently among individuals who developed CDI after immunosuppressant exposure. Thirty-eight patients received antibiotics for CDI, while 5 required fecal microbiota transplantation for concurrent CDI & IMDC.

Conclusions

CDI is common in ICI-treated cancer patients, especially those with IMDC requiring immunosuppressants. Antibiotics did not alter the need for immunosuppressants in those with concurrent IMDC. Use of PPI and antibiotics while receiving immunosuppressants for IMDC was associated with a greater risk of CDI. Further large-scale studies are warranted to clarify the role of CDI, antibiotics and immunosuppression treatment in IMDC patients.

### ACG clinical guideline: diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of acute diarrheal infections in adults [^113rtjXK]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016). Medium credibility.

ACG Clinical Guideline — non-antibiotic therapies for acute diarrheal infections in adults — medical treatment is not required in patients with non-severe, non-cholera-like diarrhea. Bismuth subsalicylates (BSSs) can be administered to control rates of passage of stool and may help travelers function better during bouts of mild to moderate illness. (Strong recommendation, high level of evidence) BSS will reduce the stools passed by ~40% and the recommended dose of BSS for therapy of acute diarrhea is 30 mL (525 mg) of liquid formulation or two tablets (263 mg per tablet) chewed well each 30–60 min not to exceed eight doses in 24 h. The major antimotility drugs used for therapy of acute diarrhea are loperamide and diphenoxylate. Of these, the most useful drug is loperamide, which has less central opiate effects. In patients receiving antibiotics for TD, adjunctive loperamide therapy can be administered to decrease duration of diarrhea and increase chance for a cure. (Strong recommendation, moderate level of evidence) The recommended dose of loperamide for therapy for adults with diarrhea is 4 mg initially followed by 2 mg after subsequently.

### A practical guide for probiotics applied to the case of antibiotic-associated diarrhea in the Netherlands [^114nwM8B]. BMC Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Methods

Search strategy and inclusion criteria

Included in this review are studies that assessed the efficacy of probiotics in reducing the incidence of antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) in patients treated with antibiotics, regardless of their age, of the intervention setting (hospital or outpatients) and of the indication for which they were prescribed. In order to identify these studies we first screened the references listed by previously published systematic reviews and meta-analyses, and then we directly searched clinical trials in public databases. Database searches were conducted on the 16th of January 2017.

We searched reviews and meta-analyses on the following databases for the period 1960–2016: the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE), the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR) and PubMed. For the DARE and the CDSR databases we searched combinations of the following terms: "probiotic", "antibiotic", "diarrhea" and "antibiotic-associated diarrhea". The search yielded 25 results from the DARE and 50 from the CDSR. In PubMed, we searched for meta-analyses using the following search texts: "((probiotic[Title/Abstract] OR probiotics[Title/Abstract]) AND (antibiotic associated diarrhea[Title/Abstract] OR antibiotic-associated diarrhea[Title/Abstract] OR antibiotic associated diarrhoea[Title/Abstract] OR antibiotic-associated diarrhoea[Title/Abstract]))", which yielded 28 results; and "((diarrhea[Title/Abstract] OR diarrhoea[Title/Abstract]) AND (probiotic[Title/Abstract] OR probiotics[Title/Abstract]) AND (antibiotic[Title/Abstract] OR antibiotics[Title/Abstract]))", which yielded 34 results. After screening of titles and abstracts and exclusion of duplicates and reviews not relevant to our purpose, we identified 28 relevant reviews and meta-analyses, containing a total of 102 relevant studies.

### Loperamide hydrochloride (imodium) [^115N6Nhg]. FDA (2008). Low credibility.

WARNINGS

Fluid and electrolyte depletion often occur in patients who have diarrhea. In such cases, administration of appropriate fluid and electrolytes is very important. The use of IMODIUM® does not preclude the need for appropriate fluid and electrolyte therapy.

In general, IMODIUM should not be used when inhibition of peristalsis is to be avoided due to the possible risk of significant sequelae including ileus, megacolon and toxic megacolon. IMODIUM must be discontinued promptly when constipation, abdominal distention or ileus develop.

Treatment of diarrhea with IMODIUM is only symptomatic. Whenever an underlying etiology can be determined, specific treatment should be given when appropriate (or when indicated).

Patients with AIDS treated with IMODIUM for diarrhea should have therapy stopped at the earliest signs of abdominal distention. There have been isolated reports of toxic megacolon in AIDS patients with infectious colitis from both viral and bacterial pathogens treated with loperamide hydrochloride.

IMODIUM® should be used with special caution in young children because of the greater variability of response in this age group. Dehydration, particularly in younger children, may further influence the variability of response to IMODIUM®.

Empiric antimicrobial therapy for acute or persistent watery diarrhea: In most people with acute watery diarrhea and without recent international travel, antimicrobial therapy is not recommended (strong, low), though an exception may be made in people who are immunocompromised or young infants who are ill-appearing, and empiric treatment should be avoided in people with persistent watery diarrhea lasting 14 days or more (strong, low). Asymptomatic contacts of people with acute or persistent watery diarrhea should not be offered empiric or preventive therapy but should be advised to follow appropriate infection prevention and control measures (strong, moderate).

### Probiotics and the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea in infants and children [^116mEQBg]. JAMA (2016). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

In children prescribed an antibiotic, is the co-administration of a probiotic associated with lower rates of antibiotic-associated diarrhea without an increase in clinically important adverse events?

Bottom Line

Moderate-quality evidence suggests that probiotics are associated with lower rates of antibiotic-associated diarrhea in children (aged 1 month to 18 years) without an increase in adverse events.

Discussion

Study selection and inclusion criteria

In this review we chose to only include studies that had a clear definition of antibiotic-associated diarrhea, to be able to compare their results in a systematic way. However, studies lacking a precise definition of diarrhea may still provide valuable information, and it could be a subject for future discussions how to interpret them and whether to take them into account when formulating recommendations. Furthermore, the strict definition of diarrhea used in some studies means that the protective effect of probiotics against AAD may have been underestimated. Given the scope of the review, we searched for clinical trials involving the use of antibiotics, but we didn't apply strict inclusion criteria regarding the kind of antibiotic used. We didn't look for studies using specific treatments, nor did we exclude studies that did not indicate which antibiotics they used, since diarrhea can be a side-effect of many. Five of the studies that we included did not specify which antibiotic was administered to the patients during the clinical trial. Of the remaining 27 studies, 21 enrolled patients taking different antibiotics, including antibiotic such as broad-spectrum penicillins and cephalosporins associated with a high-risk of AAD.

Only some studies reported which antibiotics were used among the characteristic of patients following treatment. Kotowska et al. suggested that the probiotic they tested (Saccharomyces boulardii) may be effective in preventing diarrhea caused by amoxicillin with clavulanate and by intravenous ceforuxime, but they also mentioned that they could not make definitive conclusions regarding differences in the probiotic's efficacy against different classes of antibiotics. Similarly, other studies could not detect significant differences in this regard, either because of a small sample size (relative to the number of antibiotics tested) or because of the low incidence of diarrhea in the study, or both. Twenty-two of the studies included in this review included a power analysis. Of these, 11 detected a significant difference between treatment and placebo, including two studies that were underpowered according to their power analysis. Of the 11 studies that did not detect a significant difference between the treatment and the placebo, four were underpowered. By ensuring that clinical trials have enough power it would be possible to identify which probiotics are most effective in preventing diarrhea caused by specific antibiotics, and clinicians would be able to recommend different probiotic products based on the antibiotic therapy prescribed to their patients.

### Colistimethate (coly-mycin) [^117XrdDV]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Respiratory arrest has been reported following intramuscular administration of colistimethate sodium. Impaired renal function increases the possibility of apnea and neuromuscular blockade following administration of colistimethate sodium. Therefore, it is important to follow recommended dosing guidelines. See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION section for use in renal impairment.

Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including Coly-Mycin M Parenteral, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile.

C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents.

If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.

Infectious diarrhea — workup when no pathogen is identified or symptoms worsen: If no pathogen has been identified, it may be reasonable to reevaluate stool and/or blood if there is evidence of systemic symptoms to evaluate for an undetected pathogen; if symptoms worsen after antibiotics, antibiotic-associated diarrhea (non–C. difficile) should be considered, and if hospitalized or with healthcare exposure, C. difficile becomes an additional consideration, particularly if there is fever or leukocytosis > 20000 cells/µL, and stool should be assessed for C. difficile toxin or a toxigenic C. difficile strain (eg, NAAT); stool also should be submitted for culture and susceptibility, and if a bacterial etiology is confirmed and antibiotics are indicated or have been used, susceptibility testing may reveal antimicrobial resistance.

Conclusion

We present here a workflow for the assessment of the efficacy of probiotics for the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea. The workflow consists of a series of steps (systematic review of available literature and meta-analysis of relevant clinical trials, inventory of available products and formulation of evidence-based recommendations) that can be applied to other cases, upon adaptation of methodological details such as the inclusion criteria. In order to make strong, evidence-based recommendations it is important that research of high-quality is available, in which adequate methods are followed to perform the trials and to report the results. We conclude that there is sufficient evidence to make a recommendation for the use of specific probiotic products for the prevention of antibiotic associated diarrhea. In particular, we provide a three-star recommendation for preparations with a minimal daily dose of 2 × 10 9 CFU of the probiotic strain Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG.

Infectious diarrhea — loperamide and antidiarrheal safety — A meta-analysis has shown loperamide reduced diarrhea prevalence at both 24 and 48 hours after onset of treatment and reduced total duration; however, deaths have been reported in 0.54% of children given loperamide, and all events occurred in children < 3 years old. In healthy adults, loperamide has been shown to be effective in reducing diarrhea, largely in travelers and with antimicrobials, and in these studies it was not associated with increased occurrence of adverse events; loperamide significantly reduces stool volume in traveler's diarrhea and in most noncholera watery diarrhea syndromes. Patients should be advised about medications with the potential to increase the risk of complications from diarrhea, particularly antidiarrheal and antimicrobial agents, and limited reports suggest that routine use of medications with anticholinergic properties may lead to increased risk of severe outcomes, including death, from diarrhea caused by C. difficile and Clostridium perfringens.

Discussion

Oral rehydration by gluco-electrolyte solutions represents the cornerstone of diarrhea management, but because it does not reduce the duration of diarrhea, the need for an effective anti-diarrheal drug is a matter of fact. Being viral etiology (mainly by Norovirus, Rotavirus, and Adenovirus), the cause by far more frequent of AID, antibiotic treatment should be limited to a small percentage of cases where the presence of bacterial pathogen strains (Shigella, Salmonella, Campylobacter, Escherichia coli, Vibrio cholerae) is confirmed and sensitivity of the strain to the antibiotic assessed. Protozoa and fungi-induced AID cases that require specific therapies are even less frequent. On the other hand, treatments aimed at reducing the severity and duration of diarrhea and associated symptoms, not impacted by rehydration, could be administered, to decrease the burden of AID.

For many years, probiotics have been considered a useful option, especially to restore the activity of healthy intestinal flora, stimulate the immune system, and compete with pathogens for binding sites on epithelial cells. However, the evidence about this therapeutic option is still limited and it seems to be less efficacious compared to antidiarrhoeic drugs in adults. Moreover, recent studies in children stated that probiotics are ineffective in treating AID, and the last position paper of the European Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN)considers probiotics as ineffective or with a very low efficacy in children with AID. Moreover, a recent AGA technical review stated that probiotics are not useful or not effective in most gastrointestinal diseases in adults.

In this context, the use of some antidiarrheal drugs needs to be well understood since their use may certainly reduce the intensity of the symptoms but may be also associated with possible complications. In particular, loperamide has shown several safety concerns due to the risk of toxic megacolon, necrotizing enterocolitis, syncope, QT alterations, ventricular arrhythmias, and cardiac arrest. In children, antidiarrheal drugs are also associated with hemolytic uremic syndrome. Despite these observations, the real problem seems related to the abuse of these compounds. In fact, Osugi et al.showed, in their retrospective study on 10,246 patients, 204 of whom received antidiarrheal drugs, that the administration of these compounds is not related to the increase in return visits to hospital accesses. Their work suggests that antidiarrheal drugs, if not abused, have more benefits than risks.

Acute severe inflammatory diarrhea in adults — several RCTs of empiric antimicrobial treatment have demonstrated an average of 1 day shorter symptoms compared with placebo, but these data are considered low quality; the largest treatment effect was seen in salmonellosis followed by campylobacteriosis, yet antimicrobial treatment also was accompanied by increased prolonged Salmonella shedding and occasional shedding of quinolone-resistant Campylobacter; the benefit of antimicrobial treatment of proven Campylobacter infection is small and antimicrobial agents are not recommended for most cases of proven Salmonella diarrhea; given that most inflammatory infectious diarrhea episodes are self-limited and the treatment benefit is modest, in most cases the risks of treatment outweigh the benefits, with exceptions in severe infections and in immunocompromised hosts.
