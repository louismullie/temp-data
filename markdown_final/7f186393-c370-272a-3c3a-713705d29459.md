## Question

Safe sedation approach for a child with a rare glycine cleavage deficiency

Assistant: In such cases, there is limited data on how this deficiency may alter drug metabolism. Generally, sedation regimens are cautiously tailored and monitored closely, especially since glycine cleavage deficiencies might affect certain pathways involved in processing anesthetic agents.

Any recommended sedation dosage or specific agent to use? I have the child's full workup, everything is stable, but there's no established guidance.

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about a safe sedation approach for a child with glycine cleavage deficiency (nonketotic hyperglycinemia) and whether there are specific agents or dosing recommendations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology and how it might influence sedation pharmacology. Then, I should verify which sedatives are contraindicated or risky. Next, I will review pediatric sedation safety principles and monitoring. After that, I will consider agent selection and dosing strategies, including nonpharmacologic alternatives. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, procedure-specific plan and highlight rescue contingencies and documentation needs.

> Let me first confirm the disease mechanism and its clinical implications. Glycine cleavage deficiency impairs mitochondrial glycine metabolism, causing glycine accumulation that overactivates NMDA receptors and contributes to seizures, hypotonia, and apnea; management often includes sodium benzoate to reduce glycine load and NMDA antagonists like dextromethorphan or ketamine for seizure control, underscoring the excitatory neurobiology that could interact with sedatives [^d2a1a4e7] [^90172c71].

> Wait, let me verify which medications to avoid. Valproate is contraindicated because it inhibits the glycine cleavage system and can precipitate or worsen encephalopathy and seizures in NKH; there are multiple reports of valproate-induced deterioration in NKH and related contexts, so I should explicitly exclude it from any regimen [^1f888558] [^4318d2d9]. I also need to ensure we avoid agents that suppress respiration or airway reflexes excessively in a child with baseline hypotonia and apnea risk, aligning with pediatric sedation safety guidance [^061a6756].

> Next, I should review pediatric sedation safety principles. I need to check that a pre-sedation health evaluation is completed, document ASA class and airway risk, and ensure fasting guidance is followed with attention to aspiration risk. Continuous monitoring of oxygenation, ventilation, and hemodynamics is mandatory, and a qualified rescuer must be immediately available to manage airway or respiratory events, which is especially critical in children with developmental disabilities who have higher desaturation risk [^a8a63782] [^061a6756] [^9f23643f]. Hold on, I should verify fasting recommendations; the 2020 multidisciplinary consensus supports age-appropriate fasting for procedural sedation, balancing aspiration risk against urgency, and I should tailor this to the child's age and comorbidities [^8cc5215a].

> I will now examine agent selection. Dexmedetomidine is attractive because it provides anxiolysis and sedation with minimal respiratory depression and has been used safely in mitochondrial and other high-risk pediatric populations; I should start low and titrate cautiously given variable hemodynamic responses, and I can pair it with ketamine for analgesia while leveraging ketamine's NMDA antagonism, which is mechanistically aligned with NKH management, though I need to monitor for emergence phenomena and blood pressure effects [^3353235c] [^4cf202be] [^d2a1a4e7]. Let me consider benzodiazepines; midazolam is reasonable for anxiolysis and minimal-to-moderate sedation, but I should use the lowest effective dose and avoid stacking with other CNS depressants because of additive respiratory depression and sedation, particularly in a child with baseline hypotonia [^d55af7a1] [^061a6756].

> But wait, what about propofol. I initially thought propofol might be acceptable in small, carefully titrated doses for short procedures, but hold on, I should verify labeling and pediatric safety. The FDA label advises against propofol for MAC sedation in pediatrics and notes risks of cardiorespiratory depression, and given the lack of disease-specific safety data in NKH and the child's baseline respiratory vulnerability, I should avoid propofol for procedural sedation here [^cc49e04c]. I should also avoid opioids when possible due to respiratory depression and consider regional or local anesthesia to reduce systemic sedative requirements, especially for painful procedures [^061a6756].

> Let me think about dosing strategy. Since there is no NKH-specific dosing guidance, I should adopt a minimal effective dose approach with 50–70% reductions from standard pediatric doses and titrate to effect, documenting response and adverse effects. For dexmedetomidine, a starting bolus of 0.5–1 mcg/kg over 10 minutes followed by an infusion of 0.5–1 mcg/kg/hour, titrated to the desired sedation level, is reasonable, with readiness to treat bradycardia or hypotension. For midazolam, 0.05–0.1 mg/kg IV with small incremental dosing is prudent, with continuous observation for respiratory compromise [^notfound]. I should double-check that all dosing is weight-based and that I have naloxone and flumazenil available if opioids or benzodiazepines are used, even though reversal is not a substitute for airway management [^notfound].

> Next, I should review nonpharmacologic strategies to minimize sedation exposure. Feed-and-swaddle techniques can obviate sedation in infants for MRI and other motion-sensitive studies, and child life specialists reduce anxiety and sedation needs in older children; I should coordinate timing, positioning, and comfort measures before committing to pharmacologic sedation [^d17fa753] [^122224a5]. Hold on, I should verify that these nonpharmacologic approaches are documented as first-line attempts when appropriate, to align with best practices and reduce unnecessary drug exposure [^d17fa753].

> I need to ensure procedure-specific planning. For MRI, dexmedetomidine or midazolam with careful monitoring are acceptable, and I should anticipate longer scan times and plan for motion mitigation. For painful procedures, adding ketamine to dexmedetomidine can provide analgesia while preserving spontaneous ventilation, and I should be prepared to manage emergence reactions. For dental or minor procedures, local anesthesia with minimal systemic sedation may suffice, again titrating to the lowest effective dose [^3353235c] [^061a6756]. I should confirm that the sedation team has age-appropriate airway equipment and that a written rescue plan is in place for laryngospasm, apnea, or desaturation, including positive pressure ventilation, deepening sedation, and neuromuscular blockade as indicated [^b29da6db].

> Let me reconsider metabolic stability. I should maintain normoglycemia with clear fluids containing glucose when fasting is prolonged, avoid hypothermia or hyperthermia, and minimize stress, as catabolism can worsen glycine accumulation. If the child is on sodium benzoate or other NKH therapies, I should continue them peri-procedurally to avoid rebound glycine elevation and seizure risk [^d2a1a4e7]. I should double-check that the metabolic team is aware of the procedure timing to coordinate continuation of home medications and any peri-procedural adjustments [^d2a1a4e7].

> I should confirm post-procedure monitoring. Children with developmental disabilities have higher adverse event rates after sedation, so I will observe for at least 2–4 hours after the last dose, ensuring return to baseline airway and respiratory function before discharge. Former preterm infants may have prolonged sedation effects, so I will extend observation accordingly and document recovery milestones [^9f23643f] [^dfce062f]. Hold on, I should verify that discharge criteria include stable vitals, adequate airway patency, and return to baseline neurologic status, with clear return precautions provided to caregivers [^notfound].

> Finally, I will synthesize a practical recommendation. For a stable child with glycine cleavage deficiency requiring procedural sedation, I recommend dexmedetomidine as the first-line agent for anxiolysis and sedation, starting with 0.5–1 mcg/kg IV over 10 minutes and titrating an infusion at 0.5–1 mcg/kg/hour to effect, with ketamine 0.5–1 mg/kg IV as an adjunct for analgesia if needed. If dexmedetomidine is unavailable or contraindicated, midazolam 0.05–0.1 mg/kg IV in small increments is an alternative, with strict avoidance of valproate and cautious use of opioids. I will employ nonpharmacologic strategies first, monitor continuously with a qualified rescuer present, and individualize dosing to the lowest effective exposure with a written rescue plan and extended observation post-procedure [^3353235c] [^d55af7a1] [^1f888558] [^061a6756] [^9f23643f].

---

For a child with glycine cleavage deficiency, **avoid valproate** and other hepatotoxic drugs [^1f888558]; use **benzodiazepines or dexmedetomidine** for sedation, titrated cautiously with continuous monitoring [^d55af7a1] [^3353235c]. Propofol is not first-line due to limited pediatric data and potential metabolic effects; if used, limit dose and duration and monitor closely [^cc49e04c]. Maintain normoglycemia, avoid fasting beyond guidelines, and ensure rapid access to airway and resuscitation equipment [^8cc5215a] [^9f23643f]. Coordinate with the metabolic team and document the plan and monitoring [^9f23643f].

---

## Pathophysiological considerations

Glycine cleavage deficiency causes **accumulation of glycine**, leading to NMDA receptor overstimulation, seizures, and neurotoxicity [^d2a1a4e7]. Sedatives that enhance inhibitory neurotransmission (e.g. benzodiazepines, dexmedetomidine) are preferred, while agents that inhibit the glycine cleavage system or are hepatotoxic should be avoided [^1f888558].

---

## Recommended sedation agents and dosing

| **Agent** | **Recommended use** | **Dosing considerations** | **Monitoring parameters** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Benzodiazepines (midazolam, lorazepam) | First-line for minimal to moderate sedation | - Titrate to effect <br/> - Use lowest effective dose <br/> - Avoid rapid bolus | - Continuous pulse oximetry <br/> - ECG <br/> - Blood pressure <br/> - Capnography if available [^9f23643f] |
| Dexmedetomidine | Alternative for minimal to moderate sedation | - Loading dose 0.5–1 mcg/kg IV over 10 min <br/> - Maintenance 0.5–1 mcg/kg/hr | - Continuous pulse oximetry <br/> - ECG <br/> - Blood pressure <br/> - Capnography if available [^9f23643f] |
| Propofol | Use cautiously; not first-line | - Limit dose and duration <br/> - Avoid rapid bolus <br/> - Monitor closely | - Continuous pulse oximetry <br/> - ECG <br/> - Blood pressure <br/> - Capnography <br/> - Glycemia [^9f23643f] |

---

## Agents to avoid or use with caution

- **Valproate**: Contraindicated due to inhibition of glycine cleavage system and risk of encephalopathy [^1f888558].
- **Hepatotoxic drugs**: Avoid due to potential liver dysfunction.
- **Rapid bolus administration**: Avoid to prevent respiratory depression and hemodynamic instability [^cc49e04c].

---

## Pre-sedation preparation

- **Metabolic team consultation**: Coordinate with metabolic specialists [^ad386b6d].
- **Fasting guidelines**: Follow age-appropriate fasting (clear fluids up to 2 hours before) [^8cc5215a].
- **Baseline labs**: Consider glucose, electrolytes, and ammonia if clinically indicated.
- **Airway assessment**: Evaluate for difficult airway and plan accordingly [^a8a63782].

---

## Intra-procedure monitoring

- **Continuous monitoring**: Pulse oximetry, ECG, blood pressure, and capnography if available [^9f23643f].
- **Glycemia**: Maintain normoglycemia with dextrose-containing fluids.
- **Emergency equipment**: Ensure immediate access to airway and resuscitation equipment [^9989543f].

---

## Post-procedure care

Post-procedure care includes **observation** for at least 2–4 hours after sedation to monitor for delayed respiratory depression, hypoglycemia, or metabolic decompensation [^dfce062f]. Continue **home metabolic medications**, including sodium benzoate and dextromethorphan, as prescribed [^d2a1a4e7]. Provide **caregiver education** on signs of metabolic decompensation and when to seek medical attention.

---

## Special considerations

Special considerations include **seizure management** — be prepared to treat seizures, as glycine accumulation lowers seizure threshold — and **individualized dosing**, with sedation titrated to effect while monitoring closely for adverse reactions.

---

## Documentation and communication

Documentation and communication should include a **written sedation plan** detailing the agent, dose, monitoring, and contingency plans, and the **metabolic team** should be informed of the sedation plan and outcomes.

---

A child with glycine cleavage deficiency requires a **cautious, individualized sedation approach** that avoids valproate, uses benzodiazepines or dexmedetomidine, and includes close monitoring and coordination with the metabolic team.

Nonketotic hyperglycinemia is a rare metabolic disorder with severe, frequently fatal, neurologic manifestations. Reliable and accurate diagnosis depends on careful interpretation of laboratory findings. The clinical suspicion should lead to determination of glycine in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid. Amino acid analysis presents diagnostic values for classic nonketotic hyperglycinemia, but it also should be performed in suspected cases of atypical nonketotic hyperglycinemia and in children with seizures, failure to thrive, behavior problems, and uncoordinated movements. Clinical assessment should be reinforced by demonstration of elevated cerebrospinal fluid-to-plasma glycine ratio. Confirmatory diagnosis requires enzymatic and genetic investigation of glycine cleavage system. An early diagnosis, though not affecting clinical outcome, allows proper genetic counseling, with the possibility of prenatal diagnosis. We report 3 cases of nonketotic hyperglycinemia, 2 typical neonatal and 1 atypical, diagnosed in Pediatric Hospital of Coimbra, Portugal, and investigated at Laboratory of Biochemical Genetics in 2004 to 2010 (incidence 1:47 455; prevalence 1:782 951).

Cerebral ALD

Diagnosis With MRI and the Use of Gadolinium and Sedation

Recommendations

For the diagnosis of cerebral ALD, the minimum set of MR sequences is T1 (± gadolinium), T2, and FLAIR. Sedation should be used if necessary.
Gadolinium is indicated when a new lesion or questionable lesion is identified.
The interval between gadolinium administration and postcontrast T1-weighted image acquisition can influence study interpretation where shorter intervals can yield a false-negative result. Although the optimal timing is not known, based on our experience, we recommend an interval of at least 5 minutes.

Cerebral ALD causes severe disability and death. The gold standard for the diagnosis of cerebral ALD is MRI. Gadolinium enhancement just behind the leading edge of the lesion indicates active disease. The extent of brain involvement on MRI can be quantified with the MR severity scoring system (Loes score), ranging from 0 (no abnormalities) to 34 (severely abnormal). Recently published consensus guidelines on MRI surveillance in ALD recommend gadolinium administration for boys aged 3–12 years because the risk of developing cerebral ALD is deemed highest at this point. However, new European Medicines Agency guidelines advocate restricted gadolinium use. Therefore, our panel recommends to restrict gadolinium use to characterize newly identified or questionable lesions with 2 exceptions: (1) if sedation is required, to prevent the need for additional anesthesia exposure associated with a repeat scan, and (2) if real-time review of MR imaging is unavailable and the logistics of an additional hospital visit for gadolinium administration and repeat imaging are challenging.

### Emergency management of intoxication-type inherited metabolic disorders [^d2a1a4e7]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

Pyridox(am)ine 5′‐phosphate oxidase (PNPO) is responsible for the synthesis of PLP from pyridoxine and for its recycling. PNPO deficiency is clinically indistinguishable from antiquitin deficiency, except that most patients are born prematurely. Some respond to pyridoxine, but a trial of PLP should be considered if neonatal epileptic encephalopathy does not respond to pyridoxine or shows a partial response. Pyridoxine‐responsive seizures have also been reported in hyperprolinaemia type II. Pyrroline‐5‐carboxylate accumulates and inactivates PLP by a similar reaction to that in antiquitin deficiency. Long‐term treatment with pyridoxine is recommended, though there was little evidence of benefit in one small series.

Seizures may also be a presenting feature for biotinidase and holocarboxylase synthetase (HCS) deficiencies. Severe biotinidase deficiency has predominantly neurological features and typically presents between 1 and 4 months of age. In contrast, patients with HCS deficiency can present at any age from a few hours to mid‐childhood, usually with acidosis, which may be accompanied by hyperammonaemia. Alopecia and rashes occur in both conditions. All patients with biotinidase deficiency respond to biotin, as do most with HCS deficiency, though higher doses may be needed. Deafness and neurodevelopmental problems are very common in patients with biotinidase deficiency presenting clinically but can be prevented by newborn screening. Most patients need no special treatment during acute illness if biotin is continued, but some with HCS deficiency require a high caloric intake to prevent decompensation, and insulin is reported to have helped one patient.

Non‐ketotic hyperglycinaemia (NKH) is caused by a deficiency of the glycine cleavage system. Most patients present within hours or days of birth with poor feeding, hypotonia and lethargy, progressing to coma and, usually, apnoea. If ventilatory support is provided, spontaneous respiration resumes after about 10 days, but most patients have intractable epilepsy and make little developmental progress. A smaller number of patients present after 2 weeks of age with developmental delay and seizures. Treatment is primarily with sodium benzoate, which lowers glycine levels and is sometimes combined with dietary restriction of glycine and serine. Glycine is an activator of NMDA glutamate receptors, and treatment with the NMDA receptor antagonists Dextromethorphan or Ketamine can also help. Patients often require multiple anticonvulsants. The ketogenic diet can improve seizure control, as in other epilepsies, and has the additional benefit of lowering glycine levels by reducing its synthesis.

Glycine N-methyltransferase deficiency

Diagnosis

Selective screening

Clinical presentation

GNMT deficiency in humans is an autosomal recessive defect which was discovered 15 years ago (Mudd et al). However, to date, only five individuals from four families have been diagnosed, four of whom have been described in detail (Mudd et al; Augoustides-Savvopoulou et al; Barić et al) and one in an abstract (Rakic et al). The fact that three of the individuals 18, 15 and 17 years after diagnosis remain clinically well (personal communications R. Cerone and P. Augoustides-Savvopoulou respectively) favours the view that this is a benign disorder in humans. However, taking into account observations that highly elevated plasma methionine itself is a risk factor for development of neurological signs and symptoms (see MAT I/III deficiency above), and that individuals with GNMT deficiency can have plasma methionine concentrations in the range which has been shown to be associated with clinical problems, signs and symptoms related to high methionine can be anticipated (Braverman et al; Mudd).

Based on the findings in the five diagnosed individuals, characteristics of GNMT deficiency are mild to moderate fluctuating elevations of serum aminotransferases and lack of clinical symptoms — the only clinical sign present in two individuals (siblings) being mild hepatomegaly. Presenting symptoms in three individuals were upper respiratory tract infection, failure to thrive and febrile convulsions, respectively. It is unclear whether these symptoms were related to GNMT deficiency. Of note is that aminotransferase levels within the reference range can occur (as observed in two unrelated individuals) and does not exclude the diagnosis. Liver biopsy was performed in two of the five individuals — one with hepatomegaly had mild centrilobular fibrosis with eosinophilic infiltration and one without hepatomegaly had essentially normal findings, showing only mild hydropic degeneration of a few hepatic cells. Liver ultrasound in this individual showed increased echogenicity of periportal spaces only. In all five individuals the unexplained hyperaminotransferasemia (i.e. not attributable to conventional causes of liver disease) triggered the metabolic workup which led to the correct diagnosis.

### European neuromuscular centre consensus statement on anaesthesia in patients with neuromuscular disorders [^2868b68d]. European Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Modified Delphi process

The consensus statement drafted following the ENMC workshop and subsequent meetings was distributed among its coauthors (n = 22). They were asked to indicate their agreement with each recommendation on a 9‐point scale (score 1: absolutely disagree, score 9: absolutely agree). Given the variable and specific expertise of the workshop participants, for some of them the full content of this consensus statement was not completely within their area of expertise. The participants were asked to abstain from voting if a specific recommendation was not within their area of expertise. The level of agreement for each recommendation is presented as the median score and the percentage of participants who scored ≥ 7. Consensus was defined as a median score of ≥ 7 and at least 70% of the respondents scoring the recommendation ≥ 7.

Focus and approach

This consensus statement entails general recommendations applicable to all patients with NMDs who need anaesthesia or procedural sedation and group‐specific recommendations for:
Neuromuscular junction disorders;
Muscle channelopathies (nondystrophic myotonia and periodic paralysis);
Myotonic dystrophy (types 1 and 2);
Muscular dystrophies;
Congenital myopathies and dystrophies; and
Mitochondrial and metabolic myopathies.

Suggested relevant topics were risks, myopathy‐related treatment, preoperative diagnosis and management, specific recommendation for anaesthesia including nonanaesthetic drugs used in the perioperative phase, and specific recommendations for postoperative care.

We restricted detailed clinical information concerning the six main groups of NMDs to what was essential for our purpose. For complementary disease‐specific anaesthesia considerations, we refer to the following databases:
OrphanAnesthesia; and
Syndromes & Rare Diseases in Pediatrics: Anesthesia.

As we consider the American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification too unspecific for this particular patient population, we devised a practical risk assessment tool with a scoring matrix based on the NARCO‐SS‐Risk Assessment Tool and the matrix model developed by Schieren et al.

3 ANESTHETIC CHALLENGES IN AADC DEFICIENCY

Anesthetic management of patients with AADC deficiency can be challenging given the dependence of the physiological responses to dopamine. Hemodynamic instability, temperature variability, and hypoglycemia due to sympathetic dysfunction but intact parasympathetic activity are common issues. Additionally, there may be challenges regarding intravenous (IV) access, apnea, and airway support. Since anti‐dopaminergic, anti‐adrenergic, and anti‐serotonergic agents can worsen the symptoms of monoamine neurotransmitter deficiency, care must be taken with medications that specifically interact with these pharmacologic profiles. Moreover, in this patient population, phenylephrine can cause profound bradycardia, while ephedrine has diminished activity due to its indirect mechanism of action. Vigilance, along with an understanding of the common symptoms and issues, is therefore necessary to ensure safe delivery of anesthesia in patients with AADC deficiency.

Information on the optimal perioperative care of pediatric patients with AADC deficiency is currently very limited. Together with a case series, this paper aims to summarize the best practice recommendations and pragmatic advice in the context of intracerebral gene therapy treatment. The recommendations outlined may be adapted for other rare inherited neurotransmitter disorders and can also be applied to other procedures involving anesthesia.

### Persistent NKH with transient or absent symptoms and a homozygous GLDC mutation [^cb1420ae]. Annals of Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

Three of four nonketotic hyperglycinemia patients homozygous for a novel GLDC mutation (A802V) were treated by assisted respiration and/or sodium benzoate with or without ketamine and had transient neonatal or absent symptoms and normal developmental outcome, despite persisting biochemical evidence of nonketotic hyperglycinemia. This exceptional outcome may be related to the high residual activity of the mutant protein (32% of wild type) and therapeutic intervention during a critical period of heightened brain exposure and sensitivity to glycine.

### Current evidence-based recommendations on investigating children with global developmental delay [^53f74244]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2017). Low credibility.

There is limited research on comprehensive metabolic evaluation in larger groups of individuals with GDD. It is, therefore, difficult to estimate the yield of many of the proposed first-line metabolic tests. A recent systematic review conducted for the American Academy of Neurology found that yield of metabolic investigations varied between 0.2% and 4.6%, based on clinical signs and range of tests undertaken in the studies (grade III evidence). Second-line individually tailored testing in a tertiary setting in the Netherlands produced an overall yield of 2.8% for metabolic investigations.

Individually tailored second-line testingand referral to a specialist service is recommended, when clinical suspicion remains. An evidence-based, free web-based application may be useful to tailor investigations for treatable IEMs not covered by first-line tests.

Neuroimaging

MRI of the brain has been used selectively and non-selectively in evaluating patients with GDD. The diagnostic yield of MRI is higher when used in patients where GDD is associated with clinical signs such as abnormal head circumference (microcephaly, non-familial macrocephaly, rapid change in head circumference), focal neurological signs or epilepsy. Targeted imaging was hence advocated by previous guidelines. Previous studies have demonstrated abnormal results in targeted imaging in about 41% compared with 14% with non-selective screening. Recent studies continue to demonstrate higher abnormality detection rates when MRI is performed in patients with GDD with additional clinical/neurological signs. More complex MRI protocols (eg, proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy) are promising tools to investigate GDD and enable a non-invasive measure of brain metabolites such as lactate or white matter choline, but studies have so far failed to show an increased diagnostic yield, and hence these are best used as second line in selected patients.

MRI is a more sensitive test and has no radiation exposure, making it a preferred choice over CT. However, all children under 5 years will need sedation or a general anaesthetic, which has a slim risk attached, and some children will need further investigations including a lumbar puncture. There is an argument, therefore, that children requiring brain imaging should see a specialist prior to imaging, if an anaesthetic is required.

### Practical difficulties in the diagnosis of transient non-ketotic hyperglycinaemia [^7b7fa038]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

Making a diagnosis of transient non-ketotic hyperglycinaemia (tNKH) can be difficult. We report an infant who presented in the neonatal period with symptoms of NKH. Metabolic studies performed on day 2 of life showed raised cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma glycine, and a CSF:plasma glycine ratio consistent with NKH; however, a liver biopsy performed on day 5 revealed normal liver glycine cleavage system activity. Subsequently, the child's clinical condition improved in the absence of any therapeutic medication. Clinical assessment and developmental follow-up at 5 months, 1 year, and 2 years were age-appropriate. Guidance for the investigation and management of future suspected cases of tNKH is discussed.

### Detection of mutations in the glycine decarboxylase gene in patients with nonketotic hyperglycinaemia [^c51323a2]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2005). Low credibility.

Nonketotic hyperglycinaemia (NKH) is an autosomal recessive disorder of glycine metabolism caused by a deficiency in the mitochondrial glycine cleavage enzyme. The majority of cases are caused by mutations in the P-protein, one of the four components of the glycine cleavage enzyme, also known as glycine decarboxylase (GLDC). Previous studies searching for causative mutations in NKH patients have only looked for a limited number of specific mutations or only screened part of the gene, and in many cases either no mutation or only one mutation was found, which is of limited use for prenatal diagnosis. In this study, we describe the screening of the entire GLDC gene in 3 NKH families by D-HPLC analysis of all 25 exons, identifying two point mutations and two large deletions (exon 8 and exons 2–15) using a combination of D-HPLC analysis, long range PCR, Southern blot and sequencing. For complete prenatal testing both mutations need to be identified, and we suggest that screening of the entire gene as well as deletional analysis should be considered in those subjects where only one mutation has been identified.

Minimal sedation — minimal sedation (anxiolysis) is a drug-induced state during which patients respond normally to verbal commands; although cognitive function and coordination may be impaired, ventilatory and cardiovascular functions are unaffected. Children who have received minimal sedation generally will not require more than observation and intermittent assessment of their level of sedation, and some children will become moderately sedated despite the intended level; should this occur, the guidelines for moderate sedation apply.

### Practical approaches and knowledge gaps in the care for children with leukodystrophies [^4c4a7d88]. Journal of Child Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Treatment: Management of Triggers and Pharmacologic Intervention

Prevention of seizure triggers such as sleep deprivation, constipation, illness, gastrointestinal symptoms, and other stressors constitute best practice in seizure management. As seizures do not occur in all leukodystrophy patients, we do not as a rule recommend prophylactic medication. If seizures are evident by clinical presentation and/or epileptiform activity on EEG, antiseizure medications are recommended. Often, considerations of overlapping symptoms, coinciding treatment such as stem cell transplant, muscle spasms, or behavioral exacerbation may guide the choice of medications. Titration and further management will be guided by side effects such as sedation and other symptoms, as well as seizure control after beginning treatment. Future research is needed to help determine if specific epilepsy medications and treatments are more or less effective in leukodystrophies.

In general, polypharmacy should be avoided, given that many patients do not have intractable seizures. However, for intractable patients, consideration should be given to other treatment modalities, including ketogenic diet and vagus nerve stimulation (VNS). Here, the unique features of each leukodystrophy, with their metabolic and genetic underpinnings, such as likely contraindication of the ketogenic diet in X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy due to increased very long chain fatty acids with the diet, guide the choice of such experimental treatments. These considerations play a greater role in the management of patients with very advanced disease or with specific leukodystrophies that have polymicrogyria or other brain malformations.

### Valproate-induced worsening of seizures: clue to underlying diagnosis [^1f888558]. Journal of Child Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

The use of valproate sodium as an antiepileptic is not advised in children with an undiagnosed metabolic condition because of the increased risk of hepatotoxicity and encephalopathy. Here the authors describe a 2.5-year-old girl with a history of developmental delay, failure to thrive, and a seizure disorder whose seizures worsened after the introduction of valproate sodium. This led to a search for an underlying metabolic disorder, and after extensive investigations, a diagnosis of nonketotic hyperglycinemia was made. In this report, the authors discuss the metabolic conditions that can be worsened by valproate sodium. Valproate sodium interferes with the glycine cleavage enzyme synthesis in the mitochondria, hence increasing glycine levels. The increased glycine levels are responsible for worsening of the underlying metabolic condition and increased seizure frequency.

### Prolonged paralysis following mivacurium administration in a pediatric patient with previously undiagnosed pseudocholinesterase deficiency: a case report [^7e1fed49]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

We present a case of prolonged muscle relaxation after a single dose of mivacurium in a 24-month-old child. Even though the problems associated with succinylcholine and mivacurium have been known for decades, their incidence in pediatric anesthesia is very rare. Although persistent neuromuscular block due to PChE deficiency is a rare side effect of administration of mivacurium or succinylcholine, it could result in a condition that is clinically challenging to diagnose and can be potentially lethal.

Patients with PChE deficiency exhibit a high degree of sensitivity to mivacurium and succinylcholine. Consequently, prolonged post-anesthetic apnea can occur, which may ultimately lead to death after administration of these drugs. The results of a recent study indicate that a genetically determined PChE deficiency is a significant contributing factor in the occurrence of prolonged neuromuscular block following mivacurium administration. In fact, the study revealed that PChE deficiency was present in 80% of patients who experienced an adverse event. The genetics of PChE were first described by Kallow and Genest and are widely regarded as the foundation of pharmacogenetics/pharmacogenomics research. At present, in excess of 60 genetic variants are known. It is postulated that genetically inherited deficits are autosomal and recessive in character and can occur as a result of mutations. Additionally, numerous non-genetic factors can contribute to diminished PChE activity, including malnutrition, renal disease, hepatic disease, neoplastic processes, thermal injury, hypothyroidism and burns. Additionally, certain medications, including oral contraceptives, clindamycin, insecticides, and metoclopramide, have been linked to PChE deficiency. PChE deficiency is frequently not identified until after general anesthesia has been administered, when breathing is paralyzed for an extended period of time following the administration of mivacurium. There is no causal treatment for PChE deficiency, but some approaches are available, for example, the administration of human cholinesterase, neostigmine or fresh frozen plasma, however, these therapies can also be associated with possible side effects and complications. Therefore, from the authors' point of view, the primary goal of treatment is to provide ventilation and maintenance of sedation/amnesia until the drug has been cleared from the neurosynaptic cleft and neuromuscular function has been restored.

### Hepatic form of dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase deficiency (DLDD): phenotypic spectrum, laboratory findings, and therapeutic approaches in 52 patients [^c39f6774]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

4.2.1 Lactic Acidosis and Hypoglycemia

Because of the deficient PDC, elevation of lactate levels was expected during metabolic decompensation. However, in our cohort, one individual never had increased levels of lactate in line with previously reported cases. This might be due to rapid normalization of lactate levels upon glucose infusion or delayed measurement during an acute episode in the individuals, as metabolic decompensation without any lactate level elevation seems unlikely. Hypoglycemia, though often seen during decompensations, is not always present. Hyperglycemia is less commonly found and may reflect high glucose intake, early postprandial state, or the administration of IV glucose.

4.2.2 Metabolic Markers

During metabolic crises, elevations of the plasma amino acid levels citrulline, leucine, isoleucine, valine, and alanine as well as glutamine and glutamate were seen regularly. In urine, 2‐oxoglutarate concentrations were described to be elevated during metabolic crises, whereas in cohort 1 this was not common and, in the interval, urinary organic acid levels were often normal. Elevations of branched‐chain amino acid levels in plasma and 2‐hydroxy‐isovaleric acid as well as 2‐oxoisocaproic acid levels in urine can be well explained by the deficiency of the BCKDC, as are elevations of urinary 2‐oxoglutarate levels by the deficient KGDC. While elevated glutamate and glutamine levels are likely secondary to the increase of 2‐oxoglutarate, increased alanine levels are due to the dysfunction of the PDC. Data on the pyruvate‐to‐lactate ratio, which might give further insight into PDC involvement, were non‐conclusive in the literature and not available in cohort 1. Increased glycine levels are explained by the deficiency of the glycine cleavage system; further studies are needed to understand why in cohort 1 plasma glycine levels were rather frequently elevated in the interval but only rarely during crises.

### Anaesthetic considerations in a child with methylmalonic acidemia and its literature review [^87eeef6d]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Methyl malonyl coenzyme A mutase deficiency is a rare autosomal inherited inborn error in branched-chain amino acid metabolism characterised by the accumulation of methylmalonic acids. There is relative paucity of literature regarding anaesthetic management of these children presenting for incidental major abdominal surgery. Preoperative management includes goal-directed correction of dehydration, metabolic acidosis and hyperammonemia. Anaesthetic goals include avoidance of factors that can trigger metabolic crisis like hypercapnia, hypothermia, hypoxia, surgical stress, hypovolaemia, hypotension and so on. Herein, we are reporting the anaesthetic management of a 17-month-old child with methylmalonic acidemia (MMA) posted for a major upper abdominal surgery for excision of an adrenal mass, which was incidentally diagnosed during admission for an episode of metabolic crisis. We aim to highlight the specific nuances of pathophysiology of the disease, preoperative optimisation, anaesthetic considerations, role of advanced monitoring and regional anaesthesia and current literature on the management of patients with MMA.

### Optimizing the anesthetic care of patients with aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase deficiency [^9df2da79]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

4 ANESTHETIC MANAGEMENT IN AADC DEFICIENCY

The anesthetic management of patients with AADC deficiency should be individualized given the rarity, complexity, and heterogeneity of the disease. A comprehensive plan covering the entire perioperative period, which takes into consideration the patient's profile, any technical limitations, and the proper handling of potential issues, is recommended.

4.1 Preoperative assessment

Emphasis should be placed on preoperative assessment and consultation to preempt any potential issues that may arise during the intraoperative or postoperative periods.

4.1.1 Good communication

The patient's history should be obtained from the caregivers to help better understand the baseline characteristics, such as the general level of agitation, extent of apnea, and degree and normal management of temperature fluctuation. This detailed history will help determine what intervention, if any, is required and when it should be applied. For example, many patients display what appears to be agitation or anxiety at baseline. This perceived agitation is part of the disease process due to the lack of serotonin. Since there are no medications to effectively treat such symptoms in patients with AADC, anxiolysis may not necessarily be required prior to procedures even though the patient may appear to be anxious in the preoperative holding area. Frequent and significant fluctuations in temperature may be common in these patients necessitating the use of blankets (placement or removal) or other methods to moderate temperature, according to the history given by caregivers.

Procedural, anesthesia, and critical care teams should be in communication regarding the perioperative plan. It is important that all staff involved in the perioperative care of the patient are made aware of the patient's clinical characteristics and specific personal care requirements. This may include what medications to avoid, how best to position the patient, the risk of reflux/aspiration, and the need for ultrasound‐guided line placement.

### Consensus recommendations for the diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of inherited methylation disorders [^3021d13b]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2017). Low credibility.

Inherited methylation disorders are a group of rarely reported, probably largely underdiagnosed disorders affecting transmethylation processes in the metabolic pathway between methionine and homocysteine. These are methionine adenosyltransferase I/III, glycine N-methyltransferase, S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase and adenosine kinase deficiencies. This paper provides the first consensus recommendations for the diagnosis and management of methylation disorders. Following search of the literature and evaluation according to the SIGN-methodology of all reported patients with methylation defects, graded recommendations are provided in a structured way comprising diagnosis (clinical presentation, biochemical abnormalities, differential diagnosis, newborn screening, prenatal diagnosis), therapy and follow-up. Methylation disorders predominantly affect the liver, central nervous system and muscles, but clinical presentation can vary considerably between and within disorders. Although isolated hypermethioninemia is the biochemical hallmark of this group of disorders, it is not always present, especially in early infancy. Plasma S-adenosylmethionine and S-adenosylhomocysteine are key metabolites for the biochemical clarification of isolated hypermethioninemia. Mild hyperhomocysteinemia can be present in all methylation disorders. Methylation disorders do not qualify as primary targets of newborn screening. A low-methionine diet can be beneficial in patients with methionine adenosyltransferase I/III deficiency if plasma methionine concentrations exceed 800 μmol/L. There is some evidence that this diet may also be beneficial in patients with S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase and adenosine kinase deficiencies. S-adenosylmethionine supplementation may be useful in patients with methionine adenosyltransferase I/III deficiency. Recommendations given in this article are based on general principles and in practice should be adjusted individually according to patient's age, severity of the disease, clinical and laboratory findings.

### Pathogenic variants in GCSH encoding the moonlighting H-protein cause combined nonketotic hyperglycinemia and lipoate deficiency [^19704d4a]. Human Molecular Genetics (2023). Medium credibility.

Our study illustrates that GCSH variants can affect the two predicted roles of the H-protein, glycine cleavage activity and protein lipoylation, in three possible ways. Most common was a reduction in the amount of H-protein, which affected both functions of glycine metabolism and lipoylation. This mechanism was noted in exonic copy number variants, the splice site variant, the initiator variant p. Met1? and the missense variant p. Pro115Leu. All patients retained some protein, as complete absence of H-protein is likely not viable, as has been shown in a mouse model. Selected missense variants retained protein stability and affected one function more than the other. The variant p. Thr148Pro appeared to have a greater effect on glycine metabolism with only limited effect on protein lipoylation. The variant p. His57Arg had even preserved protein stability and limited impact on glycine metabolism, but did have a clear impact on lipoylation of E2 proteins. The clinical features of these two patients mimicked this preferential impact. Treatment will need to consider the possible differential functional impacts. For variants with decreased protein, treatment that improves protein expression or stability, or gene addition may be sought. For variants that affect glycine metabolism, treatments used in NKH may be helpful. Glycine reduction strategy using sodium benzoate treatment improved seizure control of infantile spasms in patient 6 and provided resumption of breathing and improved alertness in patient 5. For disorders affecting lipoylation, treatment restoring lipoylation or providing an alternative substrate for these combined deficiencies of PDH and 2-KGDH may be helpful.

The requirement for residual activity may explain the rarity of GCSH variants as a cause of disease and of NKH. Identifying only six patients with GCSH pathogenic variants, despite molecular information on over 600 NKH subjects, puts the incidence of pathogenic GCSH variants as a cause of NKH at less than 1%.

Our study has limitations. The clinical descriptions were limited by the retrospective nature, with limited access to biopsied patient materials. Our study only examined the interaction with the P-protein through the glycine exchange reaction, and not the interaction with T-protein, or a direct study of its interaction with the lipoyltransferase LIPT2. Variants could also affect the reaction of the swinging lipoyl-arm to protect the amino-methyl group, for which Ser67 is important.

Moderate sedation — moderate sedation (conscious sedation or sedation/analgesia) is a drug-induced depression of consciousness during which patients respond purposefully to verbal commands or after light tactile stimulation; no interventions are required to maintain a patent airway and spontaneous ventilation is adequate, cardiovascular function is usually maintained, and loss of consciousness should be unlikely with drugs and techniques carrying a margin of safety wide enough to render unintended loss of consciousness unlikely.

Typically, the neurosurgical procedure lasted between 6 and 10 h. The main challenge encountered was overheating during surgery leading to vasodilation, decrease in systemic vascular resistance, and hypotension. Despite existing recommendations in the literature, administration of dopamine up to 10 mcg/kg/min was ineffective in the first patient. Thereafter, epinephrine and/or norepinephrine (0.01–0.03 mcg/kg/min IV) was used in subsequent patients with hemodynamic instability with greater success. Another challenge was the lack of MRI‐compatible equipment to measure body temperature accurately. However, this was overcome by using a liquid crystal strip thermometer fixed to the upper abdomen, which turned out to be a simple and effective method.

### Successful sedation with remimazolam and alfentanil in a child susceptible to malignant hyperthermia: a case report [^82c0f0af]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Malignant hyperthermia (MH) is a rare but fatal pharmacogenetic disorder primarily caused by pathogenic variants in the RYR1 gene, which disrupts calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Exposure to triggering agents (volatile anesthetics and succinylcholine) induces a hypermetabolic crisis characterized by hypercarbia, hyperthermia, muscle rigidity, and rhabdomyolysis. Current guidelines recommend Total Intravenous Anesthesia(TIVA) as the standard anesthetic approach for MH-susceptible patients to avoid these triggers.

Remimazolam, a short-acting benzodiazepine, has emerged as a potential alternative to propofol-based TIVA in MH-susceptible individuals. Previous cellular studies demonstrated that remimazolam does not induce calcium release in RYR1-mutant cells at clinical concentrations, and limited clinical data suggest its safety in adult MH-susceptible patients. However, its application in pediatric populations remains understudied due to age-related pharmacokinetic differences and the rarity of confirmed MH cases in this group.

This case report describes the successful use of remimazolam-alfentanil sedation combined with caudal block in a 1-year-old patient with genetically confirmed MH susceptibility, providing new insights into the anesthetic management of MH in pediatrics.

### Early myoclonic encephalopathy and nonketotic hyperglycinemia [^90172c71]. Pediatric Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

Early myoclonic encephalopathy is an epileptic syndrome with different etiologies. Nonketotic hyperglycinemia is one cause. We describe two cases of early myoclonic encephalopathy, secondary to nonketotic hyperglycinemia, with fatal evolution in the neonatal period. These two cases may better clarify clinical findings that can be associated with impairment of glycine metabolism. Distinguishing features include agenesis of the corpus callosum in patient 1, and weight loss exceeding 10%, associated with metabolic acidosis, in patient 2. The burst-suppression electroencephalography pattern is relatively common in neonatal encephalopathies, and is frequently associated with seizures. Nonketotic hyperglycinemia is an inborn error of metabolism caused by mutations in genes encoding protein in the mitochondrial glycine cleavage system. The neonatal form is a severe, frequently lethal neurologic disease. When associated with electro-clinical features, progressive lethargy and hypotonia occur in the first days of life, progressing to apnea and often death. Prospective treatment with oral sodium benzoate, the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist ketamine, and dextromethorphan can favorably modify the early neonatal course of severe nonketotic hyperglycinemia, but does not prevent poor long-term outcomes.

### An international multidisciplinary consensus statement on fasting before procedural sedation in adults and children [^8cc5215a]. Anaesthesia (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We present the first recommendations for fasting and aspiration prevention specific to procedural sedation, based upon rigorous literature review and consensus generation. These were designed to apply to patients of all ages and settings and are not intended for general anaesthesia.

Our recommendations are not a substitute for physician judgement or clinical assessment, and we expect that there will be situations in which clinicians will appropriately deviate from them due to unique clinical circumstances. This statement is not intended to assert a legal standard of practice or absolute requirement and cannot be expected to guarantee any specific outcome. No single document can rigidly categorise appropriate practice in this setting and, therefore, we offer this as a clinical guide combined with practical suggestions.

We recognised in advance when planning this project that our literature search would be unlikely to identify randomised, controlled trials of preventative interventions, given the rarity of aspiration in both procedural sedation and general anaesthesia, and the prohibitive sample sizes thus required for any such effort. Accordingly, as has been necessary for earlier fasting guidelines for general anaesthesia (see also Supporting Information, Table S4), we were required to rely upon evidence less rigorous than would ordinarily be preferred. Large observational studies and indirect evidence make up the literature supporting this statement, with such evidence then framed using an international, multidisciplinary panel and a rigorous Delphi consensus process. We were unable to use guideline methodologies designed to evaluate and grade randomised, controlled trials and, given the diversity of articles and content areas required to frame this multiple questions addressing this topic, it was not practical or appropriate to attempt to grade the methodological quality of each study. Accordingly, we selected the GRADE approach, which permitted us to express our confidence in the evidence supporting specific statements. We are unaware of another methodological technique likely to be more valid for this topic area. We believe that the process was fair and transparent and demonstrated a measurable degree of final consensus.

### Novel compound heterozygous LIAS mutations cause glycine encephalopathy [^4b5400b0]. Journal of Human Genetics (2015). Low credibility.

Glycine encephalopathy (GCE) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by defects in the glycine cleavage complex. Here we report a patient with GCE and elevated level of glycine in both the serum and the cerebrospinal fluid. Trio-based whole-exome sequencing identified novel compound heterozygous mutations (c.738-2A > G and c.929T > C (p. Met310Thr)) in LIAS. To date, three homozygous mutations have been reported in LIAS. All previously reported GCE patients also show elevated level of serum glycine. Our data further supports LIAS mutations as a genetic cause for GCE.

### Prolonged paralysis following mivacurium administration in a pediatric patient with previously undiagnosed pseudocholinesterase deficiency: a case report [^61d13578]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

In accordance with the clinic's internal guidelines, the patient was given premedication with 0.5 mg/kg body weight of midazolam orally before surgery. Venous access was successfully established, and standard anesthesia monitoring and preoxygenation were carried out in accordance with current international standards. General anesthesia was induced with propofol at a dose of 5 mg/kg body weight and alfentanil at a dose of 20 µg/kg body weight. A total dose of 2 mg of mivacurium was administered intravenously for the purpose of achieving neuromuscular block. Following a three-minute interval, the oral tracheal intubation was completed without incident, resulting in a "first-pass success". Anesthesia maintenance was achieved with sevoflurane by inhalation at an age-adapted minimal alveolar concentration (MAC) between 0.8 and 1. Monitoring consisted of non-invasive arterial blood pressure, electrocardiogram (ECG), pulse oximetry, and continuous end-tidal carbon dioxide measurement. The surgery lasted a total of 20 min, after which the child did not exhibit any signs of awakening following the discontinuation of sevoflurane. To identify potential medication errors, a comprehensive review of all medications was conducted, and no evidence of an overdose was found. Consequently, the child was observed to be apneic and unresponsive. The patient exhibited clear clinical signs of stress, including elevated blood pressure, tachycardia, and profuse sweating. A peripheral nerve stimulator did not trigger any neuromuscular responses. Quantitative neuromuscular monitoring was not used in this case. The patient was able to breathe with adequate frequency under ventilator-assisted mode and full pressure support, which failed each time spontaneous breathing trial was conducted. This strongly suggests the effects of a muscle relaxant. No evidence of hypoxemia or other causes were identified at any point during the observation period, as measured by peripheral arterial saturation levels. Consequently, sedation with propofol was reintroduced and maintained at a dosage of 4 mg/kg/hr. We hypothesized a possible muscle relaxant overdose or an inability of the metabolism thereof, and therefore decided to transfer the sedated, intubated and ventilated patient to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). A re-assessment was conducted in the PICU, with all potential differential diagnoses taken into account. A hematological examination, routine whole blood cell counts, coagulation studies, electrolyte estimates, and pseudocholinesterase levels were sent to a specialized laboratory for further analysis. Subsequently, the child was transferred to a spontaneous ventilation mode and, following the clinical full recovery of the musculoskeletal system, was extubated without incident. Consequently, the child regained consciousness approximately four hours after the surgical procedure. The subsequent course of hospitalization was unremarkable, and the child made a full recovery without short-term complications. The child was discharged the following day in a state of optimal health. A few days after the child was discharged, the results of the specialized laboratory tests arrived. Table 1; Fig. 1 show the detailed values and genotypes:

### Emergency management of intoxication-type inherited metabolic disorders [^0165d909]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

NKH is classified into severe and attenuated phenotypes according to their outcome. Patients with the severe phenotype show minimal developmental progress; some learn to smile and suck from a bottle, but most are tube fed by 6 months, with spastic quadriplegia, cortical blindness and intractable seizures. Patients with the attenuated phenotype have little spasticity and seizures may resolve with sodium benzoate and dextromethorphan or with one anticonvulsant; developmental progress is variable — they can sit and often walk and understand language but have few words and severe hyperactivity. Given the bleak outlook for the severe phenotype, withdrawal of intensive care may be considered when patients are ventilator dependent. The phenotype cannot, however, be predicted reliably from the presentation: 15% of patients presenting in the first 2 weeks have the attenuated form, and 50% of those presenting between 2 weeks and 3 months have the severe form. The phenotype can, however, be predicted from features such as neuroimaging and glycine concentrations: a severity score has been proposed by the International Working Group on Neurotransmitter Related Disorders.

Sulphite oxidase deficiency (iSOD) and molybdenum cofactor (MoCo) deficiency both lead to sulfite intoxication and cause encephalopathy, with or without seizures, in the early neonatal period, after a symptom‐free interval of 24–72 h; a few atypical patients present later. Typical patients progress to intractable epilepsy and profound developmental delay. The two disorders are clinically indistinguishable at presentation, but the plasma urate quickly falls to low or undetectable concentrations in MoCo deficiency, remaining normal for age in iSOD. This is relevant as treatment is now available for MoCo deficiency type A, caused by deficiency of the first enzyme involved in MoCo synthesis. Fosdenopterin (cyclic pyranopterin monophosphate) is the product of the deficient enzyme, so its administration allows MoCo synthesis. Neuroimaging has shown that some damage in MoCo deficiency occurs prenatally. Nevertheless, patients treated before the onset of severe encephalopathy have remained seizure‐free with near‐normal development. As delay leads to profound handicap, treatment should be started without genetic results and stopped in patients found to have MoCo deficiency types B or C.

### Optimizing the anesthetic care of patients with aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase deficiency [^a2796d41]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION TO AADC DEFICIENCY

Aromatic‐amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of neurotransmitter biosynthesis. Although reports indicate that 43% of cases are found in the Asian population due to a founder variant, AADC deficiency has been diagnosed in patients of different ethnicities worldwide., Estimating its prevalence remains challenging, and while globally less than 350 patients were previously reported in the literature, the true incidence is likely to be greater than generally recognized.

AADC deficiency is caused by pathogenic variants in the dopa decarboxylase (DDC) gene, which encodes the enzyme required for the final step of the monoamine neurotransmitter synthesis pathway. Loss of AADC activity leads to a deficiency of serotonin and dopamine, and consequently of epinephrine and norepinephrine,(Figure 1). As a result, patients with AADC deficiency have complex motor, behavioral, cognitive, and autonomic impairment, with symptom onset usually occurring within the first year of life. Initial symptoms may be nonspecific and include feeding difficulties, hypotonia, and developmental delay. However, these can vary greatly and may overlap with other common neurological symptoms, often resulting in misdiagnosis. More specific symptoms include oculogyric crises, dystonia, and autonomic dysfunction, the latter manifesting as nasal congestion, abnormal sweating/temperature homeostasis, excessive drooling, stridor secondary to laryngomalacia or tracheomalacia, hypotension, and bradycardia. Other characteristic symptoms include a failure to thrive, irritability, excessive crying, apnea, gastrointestinal disturbances, and hypoglycemia., The phenotypic spectrum can range from a relatively mild to a very severe phenotype. However, most patients (80%) are classified with a severe phenotype and are fully dependent with no or very limited attainment of developmental milestones.

Dystonic crises and other acute movement disorders in tyrosine hydroxylase deficiency (THD) can be severe; dystonic crisis may lead to complications such as rhabdomyolysis requiring admission to hospital which may result in acute renal failure, and although there have been no reported cases in THD, the management approach aligns with the general approach involving admission to an intensive care unit, supplementation of fluids and nutrition, sedation (typically with benzodiazepines), and respiratory support as necessary; other acute severe movement disorders include episodes of massive disabling dyskinesias or choreic status, managed by reducing the dosage of L-dopa and, in patients on dopamine agonists, decreasing or discontinuing the dopamine agonist; akinetic status has been described in one patient as a paradoxical reaction to rotigotine treatment; guidance states R#40 (GPP) that dystonic crises in THD could be a potentially life-threatening condition and should be treated promptly, R#41 (GPP) that the approach for status dystonicus is not THD specific, to follow the local guidelines, that dopaminergic treatment should be continued and antidopaminergic drugs must be avoided, and R#42 (GPP) that paradoxical responses to dopaminergic agents are managed by reducing or discontinuing the offending agent.

### Beyond the homozygous paradigm: symptomatic partial biotinidase deficiency in a heterozygous child-first case report from Nepal [^ee6a709e]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Biotinidase deficiency (BTD) is a rare autosomal recessive metabolic disorder that affects multiple organ systems. Its global incidence ranges from 1 in 40,000 to 1 in 60,000 live births. Biotinidase (EC 3.5.1.12) is an enzyme responsible for cleaving biotin from biocytin and dietary protein-bound sources, thereby recycling biotin for reuse. The BTD gene is located on chromosome 3p25 and comprises four exons spanning a total of 1,629 base pairs. More than 200 mutations have been identified in the BTD gene to date.

Diagnosis is primarily based on measuring biotinidase enzyme activity in plasma or serum. Elevated levels of urinary organic acids such as 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid, 3-hydroxypropionic acid, lactic acid, and 3-methylcrotonyl glycine in untreated patients can support the diagnosis. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) can also confirm the diagnosis by identifying pathogenic variants in the BTD gene.

BTD can present at any age, from infancy to adulthood, although it is more commonly identified in infancy. The clinical spectrum includes neurocutaneous symptoms such as seizures, hypotonia, ataxia, skin rashes, alopecia, hearing loss, optic atrophy, and metabolic crises that may mimic sepsis. Delayed diagnosis and treatment can lead to irreversible brain damage, coma, and even death in severe cases. Typically, clinical manifestations occur in individuals with homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations, whereas heterozygous carriers are usually asymptomatic. However, in this report, we describe a symptomatic patient with heterozygous biotinidase deficiency, an unusual presentation.

Newborn screening plays a crucial role in early diagnosis, as the condition is treatable with pharmacological doses of biotin. However, no studies from Nepal have yet documented the clinical features, diagnostic approaches, or treatment outcomes of patients with BTD.

Here, we present the first reported case of biotinidase deficiency from Nepal, highlighting the clinical presentation, diagnostic process, and response to treatment.

### A novel missense mutation in a neonate with nonketotic hyperglycinemia [^f1a6ff8c]. Pediatric Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

Nonketotic hyperglycinemia (OMIM #605899), also known as glycine encephalopathy, is an autosomal recessive disorder of glycine metabolism caused by a defect in the glycine cleavage system. A term neonate developed progressive lethargy, muscular hypotonia, and respiratory insufficiency on day 2 after birth, but no overt clinical seizures. Amplitude-integrated electroencephalography indicated a continuous burst-suppression pattern. The diagnosis of nonketotic hyperglycinemia was made biochemically and was confirmed by genetic studies, which revealed two missense mutations (one not previously described) within the glycine decarboxylase gene, GLDC. Nonketotic hyperglycinemia should be incorporated into the differential diagnosis of neonatal hypotonia, to avoid an erroneous diagnosis of sepsis or hypoxic ischemic injury. Amplitude-integrated electroencephalography may be helpful in the initial assessment of severely sick and hypotonic neonates without overt clinical seizures, and may direct further diagnostic evaluation.

### Tranexamic acid-associated seizures: causes and treatment [^90bea62a]. Annals of Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Prevention and Treatment of TXA‐Associated Seizures

Currently, there are no recommended treatments for TXA‐associated seizures. Given the low incidence and variable clinical manifestations of TXA‐associated seizures, randomized controlled clinical trials that compare the efficacy of various anticonvulsants treatments are likely to be impractical. Nevertheless, results from animal studies have shown that TXA inhibition of tonic glycine current is rapidly and completely reversed by the general anesthetics isoflurane or propofol. 47 These results suggest that general anesthetics may be useful to consider for the first‐line treatment for TXA‐associated seizures in patients. For example, TXA‐associated seizures could be prevented by simply prolonging the delivery of anesthetics during the early postoperative period. Notably, patients experience seizures most often in the first few hours after admission to the intensive care unit. At this time, TXA levels are either peaking or declining slowly. 47 In contrast, anesthetic levels are declining rapidly in the CNS, as drug delivery has been terminated. 67 Thus, the anesthetic is no longer available to provide anticonvulsant effects. Consistent with this notion that anesthetics protect against TXA‐induced seizures, many patients first develop seizures during emergence from propofol sedation. 17, 24 Also, case reports indicate that propofol is effective for treating seizures in patients who inadvertently received an intrathecal injection of TXA. 15, 23 Although treatment with a general anesthetic is likely to be effective, these drugs should only be administered under conditions that allow their safe use. This review does not provide specific recommendations regarding doses of anesthetics, as treatment of patients during the early postoperative period in the intensive care unit is highly complex. Treatment must be guided by the judgment and skill of the care providers.

### Guidelines for monitoring and management of pediatric patients before, during, and after sedation for diagnostic and therapeutic procedures [^dfce062f]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Special considerations — neonates and former preterm infants — neonates and former preterm infants require specific management because immaturity of hepatic and renal function may alter the ability to metabolize and excrete sedating medications, resulting in prolonged sedation and the need for extended postsedation monitoring. Former preterm infants have an increased risk of post anesthesia apnea; but it is unclear whether a similar risk is associated with sedation, because this possibility has not been systematically investigated. The document states that research in this area is preliminary and inconclusive and that it would seem prudent to avoid unnecessary exposure to sedation if the procedure is unlikely to change medical/dental management (eg, a sedated MRI purely for screening purposes in preterm infants).

### Anesthetic experience of an adult male with citrullinemia type II: a case report [^6eb1354e]. BMC Anesthesiology (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Citrullinemia type II is an inherited metabolic disease that has been reported to have an incidence of 1 per 100,000 of the population in Japan and to be rare in America and Europe. Under stressful medical or surgical conditions hyperammonemic symptoms can develop even in patients with no previous diagnosis of citrullinemia type II.

This condition is caused by a mutation in the SLC25A13 gene, which encodes citrin transporter, that can interfere with glycolysis, the urea cycle, gluconeogenesis, and galactose metabolism. The clinical features of citrullinemia type II are hyperammonemia, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and hepatic dysfunction. Furthermore, more than 90% of citrullinemia type II patients have a body mass index of < 20 kg/m 2. Unlike other urea cycle disorders, which are diagnosed during the neonatal period, citrullinemia type II occurs suddenly between the ages of 11 and 79 years. Our patient had typical signs and symptoms of citrullinemia type II, that is, a history of anxiety disorder, neurologic symptoms, such as, motor dysfunction and slurred speech, a body mass index of 18.9 kg/m 2, a diagnosis in adulthood, and recurrent hyperammonemic episodes in addition to inactive hepatitis C.

Alcohol intake or) stressful medical or surgical conditions can trigger hyperammonemic crisis in citrullinemia type II patients, and this can lead to life threatening events, such as, brain injury or even death. However, to the best of our knowledge, no report has been issued on perioperative concerns regarding patients with adult onset citrullinemia type II.

In our patient, a perioperative hyperammonemic event could have mimicked delayed emergence from general anesthesia, Also, hypotonic, nonconductive, low-viscosity fluids like glycin might improve visualization during cystoscopy but present the risk of hyperammonemia, electrolyte disturbances, such as, extreme hyponatremia or brain edema. Furthermore, the absorption of distension media can cause headache, anxiety, confusion, seizures, and death, which are also the symptoms of hyperammonemic crisis. In fact, the early detection of extreme absorption of distension media or a hyperammonemic event is critical for early treatment. We selected spinal anesthesia to enable changes in mentality to be checked during surgeries and dexmedetomidine as a sedative, because of its suitability for conscious sedation. Furthermore, normal saline was used as a distension media during cystoscopy.

### Benzoate treatment and the glycine index in nonketotic hyperglycinaemia [^03e4d6d8]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2005). Low credibility.

High-dose benzoate treatment aimed at reducing plasma glycine levels to normal reduces seizures and increases wakefulness in patients with nonketotic hyperglycinaemia (NKH). Since benzoate metabolism is dependent on the available glycine pool, and since the glycine pool is variably affected by the deficiency in the glycine cleavage enzyme system, we examined the importance of interpatient variability in benzoate requirement. To correct for the dietary glycine contribution, the glycine index was introduced as the molar requirement of benzoate dose necessary to normalize plasma glycine levels and subtracting from that the dietary glycine intake, both corrected for weight. The glycine index varied between 3.62 and 4.87 mmol/kg per day in five patients with a poor neurodevelopmental outcome and between 0.92 and 1.90 mmol/kg per day in four patients with a better neurodevelopmental outcome, and was 2.54 mmol/kg per day in a single patient with an intermediate outcome. The glycine index was stable over time within each patient. Exceeding the balance by either increasing food glycine intake or decreasing the benzoate dose resulted in increased glycine levels. Exceeding the glycine tolerance by increasing benzoate resulted in elevated and toxic levels of benzoate. The glycine index is a stable, individually specific parameter in patients with NKH. It has clinical consequences for the dose of benzoate required and the role of dietary management. Through its correlation with neurodevelopmental outcome, the glycine index points to potential genetic factors that could contribute to the psychomotor retardation in NKH.

### Management of seizures in patients with primary mitochondrial diseases: consensus statement from the interERNs mitochondrial working group [^715f0afe]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

In this study, 24 experts from seven European countries plus two patient representatives met to discuss the optimal management of seizures in patients with PMD to assist clinicians and patients in decision‐making and agreed on following the general NICE guidelines for seizure management, with some minor modifications. It is important to underline that consensus‐based information is useful to provide guidance, but that decisions related to treatment of seizures, in both children and adults, should always be tailored to the specific needs and risks of each patient.

It is conceded that these recommendations are not evidence‐based due, in part, to the inherent challenges of conducting clinical trials in rare diseases. Our search in bothand the European Clinical Trials Register revealed no ongoing or planned clinical trials focusing on specific ASMs and PMDs. Although consensus methods are widely used to inform clinical practice in the absence of empirical data, expert judgement ranks low in the hierarchy of evidence. Our recommendations are derived from the consensus approach, based on clinical experience from leading mitochondrial clinical services and epileptic services belonging to the EpiCare ERN of several European countries and the appraisal of current literature. The aim was to provide transparent opinions based on the available studies and clinical evidence, and to prevent unnecessary withholding of effective ASMs from patients with PMDs. It was agreed by everyone that the NICE guidelines should be applied to PMD with the only exception of VPA which is absolutely contraindicated in patients with pathogenic POLG variants and in those with known liver disease and/or a mitochondrial genotype where liver dysfunction is expected to manifest during the disease course. There was agreement for the application of the NICE guidelines only for children > 28 days. Another important limitation was that the NICE guidelines were last reviewed in 2022. Newer drugs may not be included if no approval for specific seizure type was available at the time of the guidelines release and other drugs included may not be available/approved for specific populations in some countries. The choice of the drugs listed and of other drugs not included in the list should be made by experts in the field on a case‐by‐case basis.

In conclusion, the consensus statements developed in this Delphi process seek to address an unmet need for providing recommendations on the safe use of ASMs to improve seizure management in patients with mitochondrial epilepsy. The experts strongly agreed on treating seizures and status epilepticus mainly following the NICE guideline recommendations, with few exceptions. In case a new treatment is initiated in a PMD patient, careful monitoring is suggested for potential side effects, including measurement of blood lactate and other laboratory parameters.

4.2.4 Hemodynamic stability

Hemodynamic instability is a primary concern in AADC deficiency. Therefore, anesthetic management should focus on maintaining hemodynamic stability during induction, maintenance, and emergence from anesthesia. The placement of an arterial blood pressure line can help closely monitor hemodynamic stability and guide vasopressor/inotropic therapy but is not always necessary. The authors have found that these patients vary significantly in their hemodynamic response to general anesthesia; therefore, placement of an arterial line may be determined by the clinical scenario and if the patient requires titration of inotropes for the procedure. For longer and more complicated procedures such as intracerebral gene therapy, placement of an arterial line is recommended. Any agent with anti‐dopaminergic or anti‐serotonergic properties should be avoided as they can exacerbate the symptoms of monoamine neurotransmitter deficiency. To reduce the risk of hemodynamic instability, anesthetic agents should be given at a low dose and titrated more cautiously than with the average patient as responses may vary greatly. Dexmedetomidine has been used successfully, especially for non‐invasive imaging procedures, but patients should initially be dosed with lower concentrations to assess their hemodynamic response due to the potential for an exaggerated parasympathetic response.

Preparations should be made to ensure vasopressor and inotropic support are available to manage hemodynamic instability. The first‐line treatment for hypotension in these patients is IV low‐dose dopamine (1–2 mcg/kg/min) as recommended by international consensus guidelines. However, it has been noted by the authors that, in this case series, a number of patients were unresponsive to dopamine, and our first line of treatment would be epinephrine. Norepinephrine was also used successfully. As in normal clinical practice, if a patient remains refractory to the above‐mentioned treatments, one should consider adding vasopressin. It is important to be aware that treatment of severe hypotension with pressors may increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmia and death.

4.1.5 Glucose and medication intake

Patients should avoid prolonged fasting prior to surgery to reduce the risk and severity of hypoglycemia, and oral liquids plus glucose should be given up to 1–2 h prior to surgery, depending on the guidelines and policies of the institution. Additionally, it is recommended that patients should continue to take all prescribed medications as normal to avoid the worsening of symptoms, for example, dystonia perioperatively.

Preoperative recommendations
Understand the baseline characteristics of patients to determine what interventions may be needed.
Consider placement of a PICC/central line to circumvent potential issues with IV access for various procedures before, during, and after intracerebral gene therapy surgery.
Encourage patients to take oral liquids plus glucose from 1 to 2 h prior to surgery to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia.

4.2 Intraoperative management

Patients with AADC deficiency should be cared for by a highly skilled anesthesiology team given the potential issues associated with catecholamine deficiency. There are unique challenges related to the intraoperative MRI (iMRI) setups for patients undergoing intracerebral gene therapy surgery requiring MRI guidance. These differ depending on whether an open MRI (stationary patient/stationary magnet) or movable MRI (stationary patient/mobile magnet) system is used, notably the lack of access to the patient with the open system compared with the movable system. In addition, the limited amount of MRI‐compatible equipment available may require resourceful alternatives. Regardless of these challenges, meticulous preparation is crucial to ensure patients are safe and comfortable, the endotracheal tube is secured, IV access devices are in working order, and line extensions are available. The team must be able to adapt quickly to unforeseen circumstances and with careful planning and precautionary measures, the risk of complications can be minimized. Centers taking part in intracerebral gene therapy treatment should consider conducting surgical simulations to better understand the potential challenges around process flows and issues, to help problem solve, and to devise plans ahead of time.

4.2.1 Choice of anesthetic agents

Most anesthetic agents can be used in patients with AADC deficiency except for those with anti‐dopaminergic or anti‐serotonergic properties (Table 1). Neuromuscular blockers are safe to use, although non‐depolarizing neuromuscular relaxants are preferred over depolarizing agents as they are less likely to induce muscle rigidity and hyperthermia. Opioids are not usually required if the procedure is minimally invasive.

### Proposed recommendations for diagnosing and managing individuals with glutaric aciduria type I: second revision [^67f998b4]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2017). Low credibility.

Glutaric aciduria type I (GA-I; synonym, glutaric acidemia type I) is a rare inherited metabolic disease caused by deficiency of glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase located in the catabolic pathways of L-lysine, L-hydroxylysine, and L-tryptophan. The enzymatic defect results in elevated concentrations of glutaric acid, 3-hydroxyglutaric acid, glutaconic acid, and glutaryl carnitine in body tissues, which can be reliably detected by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (organic acids) and tandem mass spectrometry (acylcarnitines). Most untreated individuals with GA-I experience acute encephalopathic crises during the first 6 years of life that are triggered by infectious diseases, febrile reaction to vaccinations, and surgery. These crises result in striatal injury and consequent dystonic movement disorder; thus, significant mortality and morbidity results. In some patients, neurologic disease may also develop without clinically apparent crises at any age. Neonatal screening for GA-I us being used in a growing number of countries worldwide and is cost effective. Metabolic treatment, consisting of low lysine diet, carnitine supplementation, and intensified emergency treatment during catabolism, is effective treatment and improves neurologic outcome in those individuals diagnosed early; treatment after symptom onset, however, is less effective. Dietary treatment is relaxed after age 6 years and should be supervised by specialized metabolic centers. The major aim of this second revision of proposed recommendations is to re-evaluate the previous recommendations (Kölker et al. J Inherit Metab Dis 30:5–22, 2007b; J Inherit Metab Dis 34:677–694, 2011) and add new research findings, relevant clinical aspects, and the perspective of affected individuals.

5 CONCLUSION

The perioperative management of patients with AADC deficiency requires specific considerations; awareness of the lack of sympathetic autoregulation in patients is critical in providing safe anesthetic care throughout the perioperative period. A thorough preoperative assessment is necessary to identify the baseline characteristics of the patient to anticipate the need for intervention. Temperature dysregulation and hemodynamic instability are the most common challenges during anesthesia. The recent approval of gene augmentation therapy by stereotactic intracerebral delivery will increase the number of patients with AADC deficiency presenting for surgery and anesthesia. With careful planning and vigilance throughout the perioperative period, patients with AADC deficiency can safely undergo anesthesia with minimal complications.

5.1 Reflective questions

What type of autonomic dysfunction can be expected in patients with AADC deficiency, and how might it impact the anesthetic management of these patients?
What are the key components of the preoperative assessment of patients with AADC deficiency?

### Alternative pathway therapy for urea cycle disorders: twenty years later [^3eb99655]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

Alternative pathway therapy is currently an accepted treatment approach for inborn errors of the urea cycle. This involves the long-term use of oral sodium phenylbutyrate, arginine supplements, or both, depending on the specific enzyme deficiency, and treatment of acute hyperammonemic crises with intravenous sodium benzoate/sodium phenylacetate plus arginine. A review of 20 years of experience with this approach illustrates the strengths and limitations of this treatment. It has clearly decreased the mortality and morbidity from these disorders, but they remain unacceptably high. The medications are generally well tolerated, but severe accidental overdosage has been reported because of the infrequent use of the medication. There is also a difference in their metabolism between newborns and older children that must be addressed in determining dosage. To avoid these complications it is recommended that drug levels in blood be monitored routinely and that very specific treatment protocols and oversight be followed to avoid overdoses. Finally, it must be acknowledged that alternative pathway therapy has limited effectiveness in preventing hyperammonemia and must be combined with effective dietary management. Therefore in children with neonatal-onset disease or in those with very poor metabolic control, liver transplantation should be considered. There should also be the continued search for innovative therapies that may offer a more permanent and complete correction, such as gene therapy.

### Consensus clinical management guideline for-associated neurodegeneration (PLAN) [^c96ff40f]. Journal of Child Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Individuals with PLAN should undergo a standard approach to immunization.

Are iron supplements recommended if a child is anemic?

Although iron accumulation may be present on neuroimaging, we do not recommend a low iron diet as it leads to systemic iron deficiency without affecting brain iron levels or disease course. Dietary iron with supplementation as needed for age and nutritional state is recommended.

Are any dietary modifications beneficial for individuals with PLAN?

There are no specific dietary modifications shown to be beneficial for individuals with PLAN.

Are there specific considerations for the use of anesthesia in individuals with PLAN?

Individuals with PLAN may undergo anesthesia if indicated, such as for gastrostomy tube placement. It may be prudent to forgo sedated investigations that will not impact clinical management. Optimizing respiratory status and avoiding anesthesia around illness decrease anesthesia risk. Succinylcholine should be avoided as it can rarely induce hyperkalemia in individuals with denervation or limited mobility.

What are the recommendations for oral hygiene?

Oral hygiene recommendations are generally similar to those of other children; however, children with developmental disabilities including PLAN may be at higher risk for dental caries. Guidelines recommend establishing a dental home by age 1 year, daily brushing with fluoride-containing toothpaste beginning at first tooth eruption, and fluoride supplementation.

What treatment is recommended for the management of heavy menstrual flow in individuals with PLAN? Is it recommended to medicate to stop menstrual flow and if so at what stage?

The American Academy of Pediatrics offers guidelines on menstrual management in adolescents with disabilities, which is a great resource for individuals with PLAN and their families. Premenarchal suppression is generally not recommended. Postmenarchal menstrual management may be appropriate if menstruation is affecting quality of life. The choice is individual and should be discussed with a knowledgeable primary care physician or subspecialist.

Emergency Care Plan

Individuals with PLAN should have an emergency care plan, which is a concise overview of their condition and treatment recommendations. The care plan may include medical diagnoses, current medications, common medical issues and suggested management, medical providers and contacts, and specific factors about the individual such as how they communicate. The American Academy of Pediatrics has developed an emergency information form for children with special needs that would be suitable for children and adults with PLAN.

### Sedation and anesthesia for imaging of the infant and neonate-a brief review [^d17fa753]. Pediatric Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Special considerations for pre-term and term neonates undergoing anesthesia/sedation for imaging

Neonates and infants deserve special consideration regarding the use of pharmacologic agents to facilitate imaging acquisition. This is especially true for preterm neonates, whose brain development is immature at birth and continues ex utero, characterized by shifting populations of neuronal receptors (NMDA, GABA) distinct from older children and adults. Many agents used to induce sedation and anesthesia act on NMDA and GABA receptors and have been associated with neuronal apoptosis in preclinical studies of young animals, leading to the previously mentioned FDA safety communication regarding sedation and anesthesia in children less than 3 years of age. Reassuringly, randomized controlled trial and longitudinal cohort data do not link brief anesthetic exposure to later neurodevelopmental delay.

As previously discussed, nonpharmacologic approaches, such as feed-and-swaddle and immobilization have been studied to limit movement during motion-sensitive studies (typically MRI). These succeed more than 90% of the time and are most successful in neonates and infants less than 3 months old. Published protocols are available for reference. This approach lessens the risk for adverse events and is therefore preferred when feasible. In some situations, particularly in ill or older infants, sedation or anesthesia is necessary to achieve diagnostic-quality images.

### Perioperative management of a child with very-long-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency [^e92830f3]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2002). Low credibility.

Very-long-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency is an inborn error of fatty acid metabolism. The clinical presentation of this disease in children is either a severe form with onset of symptoms in the first months of life, cardiomyopathy, metabolic acidosis, myopathy and a high mortality, or a less severe form manifesting mainly with hypoglycaemia. Perioperative fasting and (even emotional) stress can trigger metabolic decompensation through the altered metabolism of endogenous fatty acids resulting in hypoglycaemia, acute cardiac and hepatic dysfunction and rhabdomyolysis. We report the perioperative management of a 9-year-old boy suffering from the severe form of this disease who underwent circumcision. Metabolism was kept stable in this child by using a glucose — electrolyte infusion throughout the perioperative period to avoid the biochemical consequences of fasting and a benzodiazepine — opioid technique combined with regional anaesthesia to minimize the stress response. Considering reports about a possible interference of propofol with fatty acid oxidation and to avoid the unnecessary administration of fatty acids, propofol should not be used in these patients.

Biochemical abnormalities

Assays of plasma amino acids revealed isolated marked hypermethioninemia ranging from 400 to 1247 μmol/L (ref. range 13–45). Further investigation revealed remarkably high levels of plasma AdoMet in all five individuals (1149–2840 μmol/L, ref. range 73–109), with plasma AdoHcy levels within the normal range (21–72 μmol/L, ref. range 15–45). Plasma sarcosine (N-methylglycine) was measured in three patients (Mudd et al; Augoustides-Savvopoulou et al) and was well within the reference range (1.4–2.1 μmol/L, ref. range 0.6–2.7). Hypermethioninemia accompanied by very high levels of plasma AdoMet in the presence of normal plasma AdoHcy and sarcosine are considered diagnostic hallmarks of GNMT deficiency. Interestingly, in one child AdoMet levels in whole blood were in the upper normal range, although with an increased AdoMet/AdoHcy ratio (Barić et al). However, in plasma, AdoMet was highly elevated — 3348 nmol/L (reference range 71–118 nmol/L), while AdoHcy was 63 nmol/L (reference range 9.3–14.1 nmol/L). A plausible explanation for increased AdoHcy in this individual could be the extremely high plasma AdoMet which may have caused a secondary increase of AdoHcy via non-enzymatic or artefactual decay of AdoMet. In fact, AdoMet is an unstable compound and can break down to AdoHcy due to inappropriate handling or storage, particularly if the sample is not properly acidified. This also shows that plasma is the sample of choice for assaying AdoMet and AdoHcy. This individual also differed in the fact that mild elevations of plasma tHcy levels (21.4–28.3 μmol/L, ref. range 5–12) were found which can be explained by the inhibitory effect of high methionine levels on betaine-homocysteine-methyltransferase, N5-methyltetrahydrofolate–homocysteine methyltransferase and cystathionine gamma-lyase activity (Barić et al). The diagnosis in all five individuals was confirmed by GNMT mutation analysis. Three individuals, including the two siblings, were compound heterozygotes for two missense mutations c.1481 T > C (Leu49Pro), c.3715C > A (His176Asn) and c.529C > A (His177Asn), c.431C > T (Ala144Val), respectively (Luka et al; Rakic et al). The His176Asn and His177Asn mutations are in fact the same variant, albeit reported differently by molecular clinical laboratories. Two individuals were homozygous, one for the c.3415A > G (Asn140Ser) mutation (Augoustides-Savvopoulou et al) and the other for the c.296G > A (Arg99His) mutation (Barić et al). Expression studies in three individuals revealed decreased activity for the mutations as follows: Leu49Pro 10%, His176Asn 75%, and Asn140Ser 0.5% of wild type activity (Luka and Wagner) and in one (Arg99His) minimal activity (Barić et al). Predictions of in vivo enzyme activities on the basis of activities found in expression studies can be difficult. Kinetic factors and protein conformational changes as possible causes of impaired enzyme function have been studied for mutations Leu49Pro, His176Asn and Asn140Ser, and were discussed in detail (Luka and Wagner).

### Label: CLOBAZAM-clobazam suspension… [^4f0a9775]. FDA (DailyMed) (2023). Medium credibility.

2. 5 Dosage Adjustments in CYP2C19 Poor Metabolizers In CYP2C19 poor metabolizers, levels of N-desmethylclobazam, clobazam's active metabolite, will be increased. Therefore, in patients known to be CYP2C19 poor metabolizers, the starting dose should be 5 mg/day and dose titration should proceed slowly according to weight, but to half the dose presented in Table 1, as tolerated.
2. 7 Dosage Adjustments in Patients with Hepatic Impairment Clobazam oral suspension is hepatically metabolized; however, there are limited data to characterize the effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of clobazam oral suspension. For this reason, proceed slowly with dosing escalations. For patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment, the starting dose should be 5 mg/day in both weight groups.
5.

4 Potentiation of Sedation from Concomitant Use with Central Nervous System Depressants Since clobazam has a central nervous system depressant effect, patients or their caregivers should be cautioned against simultaneous use with other CNS depressant drugs or alcohol, and cautioned that the effects of other CNS depressant drugs or alcohol may be potentiated.
5. 5 Somnolence or Sedation Clobazam causes somnolence and sedation. In clinical trials, somnolence or sedation was reported at all effective doses and was dose-related. In general, somnolence and sedation begin within the first month of treatment and may diminish with continued treatment. Prescribers should monitor patients for somnolence and sedation, particularly with concomitant use of other central nervous system depressants.

Prescribers should caution patients against engaging in hazardous activities requiring mental alertness, such as operating dangerous machinery or motor vehicles, until the effect of clobazam is known. Most Common Adverse Reactions in an LGS Placebo Controlled Clinical Trial Table 3 lists the adverse reactions that occurred in ≥ 5% of clobazam-treated patients, and at a rate greater than placebo-treated patients, in the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group clinical study of adjunctive AED therapy for 15 weeks.

Sedation

The decision to sedate a child must be made on an individual basis. Technological developments of recent years have brought about a revolution in NM practices. Increasingly more efficient examinations are available, with less radiation exposure and shorter duration. The use of sedation has become less frequent, and many departments have even abandoned it. On the other hand, PET/MR imaging may require sedation, especially in children older than 3–6 months and younger than 6 years, because MR sequences can significantly increase the duration of the examination. When sedation/general anesthesia is required, it will be administered after tracer injection and before image acquisition, especially when performing a brain 18 F-FDG PET/CT (PET/MRI) due to the effects of anesthesia on regional cerebral glucose metabolism.

The depth of sedation is classified as follows: minimal sedation (anxiolysis), moderate sedation (conscious sedation), deep sedation, and general anesthesia. Acute complications are sparse (0.4%), but long-term neurotoxicity and cognitive side effects remain unknown. Some studies reported a higher incidence of adverse events in younger patients with several diseases. Risks of developmental and behavioral disorders and language acquisition issues could be more frequent in children who underwent general anesthesia under 3 years.

In the rare cases in which sedation is needed, a multidisciplinary experienced team with an anesthetist is required. To offer sedated examinations, the imaging department must have sufficient human and technical resources (monitoring device, emergency cart, and age-appropriate resuscitation equipment). Propofol, Dexmedetomidine, Ketamine, Midazolam, and Etomidate are the most used drugs.

### Valproate-induced chorea and encephalopathy in atypical nonketotic hyperglycinemia [^4318d2d9]. Pediatric Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

Nonketotic hyperglycinemia is a disorder of amino acid metabolism in which a defect in the glycine cleavage system leads to an accumulation of glycine in the brain and other body compartments. In the classical form it presents as neonatal apnea, intractable seizures, and hypotonia, followed by significant psychomotor retardation. An important subset of children with nonketotic hyperglycinemia are atypical variants who present in a heterogeneous manner. This report describes a patient with mild language delay and mental retardation, who was found to have nonketotic hyperglycinemia following her presentation with acute encephalopathy and chorea shortly after initiation of valproate therapy.

### Diagnosis and management of glutaric aciduria type I – revised recommendations [^b26feb92]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2011). Low credibility.

Use of dietary recommendations and individualization of treatment

Dietary recommendations outlining the age-dependent needs of a growing child have been developed by international organizations (Suppl. Tables 6, 7). They are usually set to the safe level. Note that in Suppl. Table 6 protein recommendations for infants and children may vary significantly between the recommendations due to the use of different reference proteins and the use of average versus safe levels. Standard dietary recommendations can form the basis for dietary treatment in GA-I but due to discrepant and varying requirements for nutrients and energy in symptomatic children they should be adjusted to the individual (Müller and Kölker; Yannicelli et al.). There is still limited practical experience with the use of more recent recommendations such as the report of the joint WHO/FAO/UNU expert consultation (World Health Organization).

Low lysine diet

Dietary treatment for GA-I aims to reduce the intake of lysine, the quantitatively most relevant amino acid precursor of neurotoxic GA and 3-OH-GA, while maintaining sufficient intake of essential nutrients and energy substrates. Many metabolic centers limit the total protein intake to reduce lysine intake rather than limiting lysine intake per se. This is often for practical reasons such as the lack of precise or recent data on lysine contents of foods in their country. However, since the lysine content varies considerably in different natural proteins, eg 2–4% (lysine/protein) in cereals and 9% (lysine/protein) in fish, the daily lysine intake may be less well controlled by calculation of protein intake rather than lysine intake (Suppl. Table 8). This may also increase the risk of essential amino acid deficiencies, including tryptophan, which is associated with neurological dysfunction such as irritability and sleep irregularity (Hoffmann et al.). Low lysine diet is often combined with the use of lysine-free, tryptophan-reduced amino acids (AA) supplements. These supplements are given with the aim of preventing malnutrition by providing essential amino acids and (depending on the product) also minerals, trace elements and vitamins. Although in some studies (Busquets et al; Kölker et al; Kölker et al; Heringer et al; Naughten et al.) the majority of patients on a low lysine diet also received lysine-free, tryptophan-reduced amino acids supplements, whether a low lysine diet is more effective and safer if it is combined with these supplements has not been systematically studied.

### A single nucleotide substitution that abolishes the initiator methionine codon of the GLDC gene is prevalent among patients with glycine encephalopathy in jerusalem [^22a3966e]. Journal of Human Genetics (2005). Low credibility.

Glycine encephalopathy (GE) (non-ketotic hyperglycinemia) is an autosomal recessive neurometabolic disease caused by defective activity of the glycine cleavage system. Clinically, patients present usually in the neonatal period with hypotonia, encephalopathy, hiccups and breath arrests with or without overt seizures. GE is considered rare, but its incidence is relatively high in several geographical areas around the world. We report a novel mutation causing GE in six extended Arab families, all from a small suburban village (population 5,000). A methionine to threonine change in the initiation codon of the glycine decarboxylase gene led to markedly reduced glycine decarboxylase mRNA levels and abolished glycine cleavage system activity.

Metabolic evaluation in children with a cyclic vomiting pattern — diagnostic testing and timing are specified: the diagnosis of these disorders is established with plasma amino acid and urine organic acid analyses, and the sensitivity of metabolic testing is improved when performed early in an acute episode before dextrose-containing intravenous fluid is given. Analyses of plasma acylcarnitines and urine acylglycines are more sensitive than urine organic acids in fatty acid oxidation disorders and may be diagnostic even when asymptomatic; if any screening tests are abnormal, the patient should be referred to a metabolic specialist for further evaluation. Fatty acid oxidation disorders, including medium-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency, can present with a cyclic vomiting pattern.

### Guidelines for monitoring and management of pediatric patients before, during, and after sedation for diagnostic and therapeutic procedures [^9f23643f]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Pediatric procedural sedation — monitoring, risk reduction, and rescue highlights that these adverse responses during and after sedation for a diagnostic or therapeutic procedure may be minimized, but not completely eliminated, by a careful preprocedure review of the patient's underlying medical conditions, with children with developmental disabilities having a threefold increased incidence of desaturation compared with children without developmental disabilities; appropriate drug selection, a clear understanding of pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics and drug interactions, and the presence of an individual with the skills needed to rescue a patient from an adverse response are critical, and appropriate physiologic monitoring and continuous observation by personnel not directly involved with the procedure allow for the accurate and rapid diagnosis of complications and initiation of appropriate rescue interventions; the work of the Pediatric Sedation Research Consortium has improved the sedation knowledge base, demonstrating the marked safety of sedation by highly motivated and skilled practitioners, yet these groundbreaking studies also show a low but persistent rate of potential sedation-induced life-threatening events even when sedation is under a motivated team of specialists, and these studies have helped define the skills needed to rescue children experiencing adverse sedation events.

### Two novel missense mutations observed in nonketotic hyperglycinemia [^de16f8d9]. Pediatric Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

Nonketotic hyperglycinemia, also known as glycine encephalopathy, is an autosomal recessive disorder of an inborn error of the glycine metabolism, caused by deficiency in the mitochondrial glycine cleavage enzyme. The majority of cases are caused by mutations in P-protein, one of the four components of the glycine cleavage enzyme, glycine decarboxylase. We describe a male neonate with hypotonia, hiccups, and persistent apnea, but without seizures. The patient's glycine level in cerebrospinal fluid and plasma was 328.3 nmol/mL (reference value, 2.2–14.2 nmol/mL) and 1439 nmol/mL (reference value, 232–740 nmol/mL), respectively. The cerebrospinal fluid/plasma ratio of 0.228 represented an increase (normal range, < 0.04). Two novel heterozygous missense mutations (c.1130C > T (p. A377V) and c.2081_2088del (p. A694DfsX11) in exons 8 and 18) in the glycine decarboxylase gene confirmed the diagnosis of nonketotic hyperglycinemia.

### Anaesthetic management of an infant with MEGD (H) EL syndrome undergoing cochlear implant [^3353235c]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The syndrome has these features: 3-methylglutaconic aciduria (MEG), deafness(D), encephalopathy (E), Leigh-like syndrome (L). This disorder is caused by biallelic mutations in serine active site-containing protein 1 (SERAC1) gene. When these patients experience hepatopathy (H) in addition to the above manifestations, the syndrome is referred to as MEGD(H)EL. The pathology of this syndrome shares features with diverse types of inborn errors of metabolism.

Case presentation

We discussed the anaesthetic management of an infant 2-year-old suffering from MEGD(H)EL syndrome undergoing cochlear implant. We discuss the pathology, genetics and significant aspects of this sporadic disease which is important for anaesthesiologist.

Conclusions

The usage of dexmedetomidine as the main anaesthetic drug might have the benefit of a non-triggering anaesthetic agent in patients with a mitochondrial disease. Mixture of dexmedetomidine and ketamine provide an effective combination for procedural sedation, predominantly in select populations who are at a high risk of perioperative complications due to underlying co-morbid conditions.

### Two novel missense mutations in nonketotic hyperglycinemia [^a4159c05]. Journal of Child Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Nonketotic hyperglycinemia (OMIM no. 605899) is an autosomal recessively inherited glycine encephalopathy, caused by a deficiency in the mitochondrial glycine cleavage system. Here we report 2 neonates who were admitted to the hospital with complaints of respiratory failure and myoclonic seizures with an elevated cerebrospinal fluid/plasma glycine ratio and diagnosed as nonketotic hyperglycinemia. We report these cases as 2 novel homozygous mutations; a missense mutation c.593A > T (p.D198 V) in the glycine decarboxylase gene and a splicing mutation c.339G > A (Q113Q) in the aminomethyltransferase gene were detected. We would like to emphasize the genetic difference of our region in inherited metabolic diseases once again.

### Ventriculolumbar perfusion and inhalational anesthesia with sevoflurane in an accidental intrathecal injection of tranexamic acid: unreported treatment options [^0ec0f80d]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Tranexamic acid (TXA) decreases hemorrhage-related mortality in trauma patients and is increasingly being used during obstetric and orthopedic surgeries. Inadvertent intrathecal injection of TXA is a rare, potentially lethal event leading to dose-dependent cardiotoxicity and neurotoxicity. TXA enhances neuronal excitation by antagonizing inhibitory γ-aminobutyric acid type A and glycine receptors. Until now, mechanistic-based pharmacological treatments targeting multiple central nervous system receptors have been advocated for use in such cases, with no data on intrathecal TXA elimination techniques.

Case Presentation

A patient scheduled for hip surgery accidentally received 350mg of intrathecal TXA instead of levobupivacaine. The clinical picture progressed from spinal segmental myoclonus to generalized convulsions and malignant arrhythmias. The treatment consisted of ventriculolumbar perfusion with normal saline at a rate of 50mL/hour starting 5hours after TXA administration and inhalational sedation with sevoflurane, in addition to drugs acting on multiple receptors at different central nervous system levels. Over 2months the neurological status improved, although it was not complete.

Conclusions

For the first time, the feasibility and possible clinical efficacy of combined treatment with ventriculolumbar perfusion and inhalational sedation with sevoflurane were demonstrated. A referral to a neurosurgical facility is recommended in patients with acute TXA-induced neurotoxicity and cardiotoxicity.

### Anaesthetic management of an infant with MEGD (H) EL syndrome undergoing cochlear implant [^4cf202be]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Pediatric anaesthesiologists must be familiar with the disease as patients' number suffering from MEGD(H)EL syndrome is predictable to increase.

The anaesthetic techniques and drugs choice, fluid management must be created upon the understanding of the pathology of disease.

Hypoglycemia is the most common symptom in the neonatal period, so the level of glucose must be checked and maintained with supplement of glucose infusions.

Centrally acting alpha-adrenergic agonists such as dexmedetomidine can be employed for sedation as an alternative to propofol. Dexmedetomidine don't cause respiration depression, protects airway reflexes, provides excellent anxiolysis and sedation. It had been reported to be safe in mitochondrial disease since the mechanism of action in the central nervous system is different from often used general anaesthetic agents. Successful trials had been done using non-triggering anaesthesia with dexmedetomidine in mitochondrial disease.

Further prospective studies will enable a thorough analysis of perioperative patient management and the usage of general anaesthesia in mitochondrial disease, with the aim of establishing evidence-based clinical guidelines.
