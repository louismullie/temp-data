## Question

74 year old male with exertional tremors in non dominant arm

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about evaluating and managing a 74-year-old man with a non-dominant arm exertional tremor. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical syndrome and how to classify the tremor phenomenology. Then, I should verify the differential diagnosis in late-onset asymmetric tremor and the red flags that push me away from essential tremor. Next, I will outline the diagnostic workup, including medication review, examination, and when to use dopamine transporter imaging. After that, I need to consider management pathways for likely diagnoses such as essential tremor, Parkinson's disease, dystonia, and cerebellar or toxic-metabolic causes. Finally, I should address prognosis, follow-up, and the role of ET-plus, making sure I double-check areas of controversy and uncertainty in classification and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the clinical syndrome. An exertional tremor in the non-dominant arm implies an action tremor that is provoked by movement or sustained posture, and the asymmetry and late age of onset are important clues that I should not jump past, because they can shift pretest probabilities away from classic bilateral essential tremor and toward parkinsonian or dystonic etiologies, especially in older adults [^115qs2yP] [^116svrix].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about essential tremor just because it is common. I need to check the 2018 MDS Axis 1 criteria: ET is an isolated bilateral upper limb action tremor of at least 3 years' duration, and if there are additional neurologic signs of uncertain significance, that becomes ET-plus rather than classic ET, which is common in older adults and can blur diagnostic boundaries, so I should keep that in mind as I proceed [^115LtVqJ] [^112T6FcA] [^115Hd484].

> Next, I should review the differential diagnosis systematically. Essential tremor remains on the list, but late-onset asymmetric postural-kinetic tremor raises concern for Parkinson's disease, particularly when rest tremor is absent early or when there is subtle bradykinesia or rigidity, and I should remember that PD tremor can be re-emergent postural rather than purely resting, which can mimic ET early on [^115qs2yP] [^116wAPGf] [^1119Qsww]. Dystonic tremor is another key consideration, especially if there are task-specific features, position-specific suppression, or subtle dystonic posturing, and I need to look carefully for these clues on exam [^115qs2yP]. Cerebellar tremor presents with intention and ataxia, and in older men I should consider FXTAS if there is intention tremor with ataxia, executive dysfunction, neuropathy, or MRI middle cerebellar peduncle hyperintensities, so I should ask about family history and plan FMR1 testing if indicated [^116aAzDi] [^1158CTdQ]. Finally, I must not forget medication-induced tremor and toxic-metabolic causes, which are common in older adults and often overlooked [^114fmwTY] [^117HFt3v].

> I will now examine the diagnostic approach. First, I should double-check medications meticulously, including prescription, over-the-counter, and supplements, because drugs such as valproate, lithium, SSRIs, stimulants, and others can cause or exacerbate tremor, and timing of initiation relative to tremor onset matters for causality assessment [^114fmwTY]. Then, I should perform a focused neurologic examination distinguishing postural-kinetic from rest tremor, assess for bradykinesia, rigidity, and gait disturbance, and screen for dystonic features, intention tremor, and signs of peripheral neuropathy, since these associated signs reclassify the syndrome and guide testing and treatment [^114id34R]. If the diagnosis remains uncertain after expert clinical assessment, dopamine transporter SPECT can help distinguish PD from ET or other causes in diagnostically ambiguous cases, and I should reserve it for situations where the result will change management [^1147YBZD] [^113oES2G].

> Wait, let me verify the role of ET-plus here. Given the patient's age and potential for soft neurologic signs, ET-plus is a plausible initial label if I find mild tandem gait impairment, questionable dystonia, or subtle rest tremor without meeting full criteria for another disorder, but I should document and follow these "plus" features over time because classification can evolve and inter-rater agreement for ET-plus versus dystonia is modest, so I should avoid anchoring too early [^115Hd484] [^116gX3w4].

> Now, I should consider management if the working diagnosis is essential tremor or ET-plus. First-line pharmacotherapy includes propranolol or primidone, with topiramate as an alternative when first-line agents are contraindicated or not tolerated, and I need to ensure I screen for cardiac conduction disease before propranolol and counsel about sedation and dizziness with primidone, starting low and titrating slowly to improve tolerability [^116Pg9Y8] [^114kawQg] [^1175XekN]. If tremor remains functionally disabling despite optimized medication, unilateral ventral intermediate thalamic deep brain stimulation or MRI-guided focused ultrasound thalamotomy are evidence-based surgical options, and I should discuss risks, benefits, laterality, and patient preferences in shared decision-making, noting that focused ultrasound may be attractive for patients with comorbidities or those wishing to avoid implanted hardware [^1141VQGJ] [^114xGS6R] [^112Gekhh].

> But wait, what if the tremor is actually dystonic rather than essential. In that case, I should reconsider targets and expectations, because dystonic tremor may respond better to GPi-based interventions than Vim, and botulinum toxin can be useful for focal dystonic tremors, so I need to ensure the phenomenology is correct before committing to a surgical plan [^113QqCJB] [^113ZaXY3]. If cerebellar features or intention tremor predominate, I should evaluate for FXTAS with FMR1 testing and MRI, and manage supportively while addressing ataxia and any neuropathy, recognizing that tremor control is often limited in cerebellar disease [^116aAzDi] [^1158CTdQ].

> If Parkinson's disease emerges as the diagnosis, I should confirm with DAT-SPECT when needed and initiate dopaminergic therapy tailored to age and comorbidities, while counseling about disease course and monitoring for motor complications, and I should remember that early PD can present with asymmetric postural tremor before clear rest tremor or bradykinesia, so longitudinal follow-up is essential to avoid mislabeling as ET [^1147YBZD] [^1119Qsww].

> I need to ensure I address treatable contributors. If a medication or toxin is identified, the priority is removal or dose reduction when feasible, and if a metabolic cause is found, targeted therapy may improve or resolve the tremor, so I should not stop at a generic ET label without reviewing reversible factors first [^117HFt3v] [^114fmwTY].

> Next, I should review prognosis and follow-up. Essential tremor is progressive, with longitudinal data suggesting average annual worsening on the order of 3–5% in tremor severity, and many patients develop spread to cranial structures over time, so I should set expectations and reassess periodically for functional impact and emerging associated signs that might reclassify the syndrome [^112WWj7C] [^114BJZsJ]. I should also screen for non-motor symptoms such as anxiety, depression, and cognitive concerns, which are common and affect quality of life, and incorporate patient-reported goals into treatment adjustments [^112BVxyo] [^1112p28G].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of objective measurement. While clinical scales are useful, they have inter-rater variability, and instrumented or video-based assessments can improve quantification and tracking over time, which is particularly helpful when comparing across visits or considering surgical candidacy, though access may be limited in routine practice [^116ecwKe] [^113eESx7].

> In summary, I need to ensure a careful, stepwise approach: classify the tremor phenomenology and associated signs using Axis 1, actively search for reversible causes, reserve DAT-SPECT for unresolved diagnostic uncertainty, and tailor therapy to the most likely etiology while planning longitudinal reassessment for evolution into PD, dystonia, or cerebellar syndromes, keeping in mind the controversies around ET-plus and the need to avoid premature diagnostic closure [^114id34R] [^115LtVqJ] [^116gX3w4].

A 74-year-old man with exertional tremor in the non-dominant arm most likely has **essential tremor (ET)** or **early Parkinson's disease (PD)** [^115qs2yP], but dystonic tremor, drug-induced tremor, and cerebellar tremor must also be considered [^112E58Dk] [^114id34R]. ET typically presents as a **bilateral, symmetric, postural–kinetic tremor** with a positive family history and alcohol responsiveness, whereas PD tremor is **resting, asymmetric, and re-emergent** with bradykinesia and rigidity [^1112p28G] [^116wAPGf]. Diagnosis is clinical; if uncertain, **dopamine transporter SPECT (DaTscan)** can help distinguish PD from ET [^1147YBZD]. Management is tailored: ET is treated with propranolol or primidone, and PD with dopaminergic therapy; botulinum toxin or surgery (DBS/MRgFUS) are options for refractory cases [^116Pg9Y8] [^114kawQg] [^1141VQGJ] [^114xGS6R].

## Differential diagnosis

| **Tremor type** | **Clinical features** | **Distinguishing characteristics** |
|-|-|-|
| Essential tremor (ET) | - Bilateral, symmetric, postural–kinetic tremor <br/> - Positive family history <br/> - Alcohol responsive [^notfound] | - No bradykinesia or rigidity <br/> - No rest tremor |
| Parkinson's disease (PD) | - Resting tremor <br/> - Asymmetric <br/> - Bradykinesia <br/> - Rigidity <br/> - Re-emergent tremor [^116wAPGf] | - Rest tremor <br/> - Bradykinesia <br/> - Rigidity |
| Dystonic tremor | - Irregular, jerky <br/> - Position-specific <br/> - Extinguished by specific postures [^115qs2yP] | - Dystonic posturing <br/> - Task-specific |
| Drug-induced tremor | - Tremor temporally related to medication use [^114fmwTY] | - Medication history |
| Cerebellar tremor | - Intention tremor <br/> - Ataxia <br/> - Dysmetria [^notfound] | - Intention tremor <br/> - Ataxia |

---

## Diagnostic approach

- **History**: Onset, progression, family history, medication use, alcohol responsiveness, functional impact [^115LtVqJ].
- **Examination**: Tremor characteristics, bradykinesia, rigidity, dystonia, cerebellar signs [^114id34R].
- **Imaging**: DaTscan if diagnostic uncertainty between PD and ET [^1147YBZD].
- **Laboratory tests**: Thyroid function, electrolytes, glucose, liver function tests [^notfound].

---

## Management strategies

### Essential tremor

- **First-line**: Propranolol or primidone [^1121XPxW].
- **Second-line**: Topiramate, gabapentin, benzodiazepines [^115LgxhE].
- **Botulinum toxin**: For refractory cases [^111zDqq3].
- **Surgery**: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) or MR-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) for severe, refractory tremor [^1141VQGJ] [^112Gekhh].

---

### Parkinson's disease

- **First-line**: Levodopa, dopamine agonists, MAO-B inhibitors.
- **Adjuncts**: Amantadine, anticholinergics for tremor-dominant PD.
- **Advanced therapies**: DBS, continuous levodopa infusion for refractory cases.

---

### Dystonic tremor

Management includes **botulinum toxin injections** for focal dystonia and tremor control, and **oral medications** such as anticholinergics or benzodiazepines.

---

### Drug-induced tremor

Management centers on identifying and adjusting the **offending medication** and using **alternative agents** when appropriate.

---

## Prognosis

Essential tremor is **progressive** but generally benign; severity may increase over time [^112WWj7C]. Parkinson's disease is a **progressive neurodegenerative disorder** with motor and non-motor complications. Dystonic tremor is **chronic** with fluctuations; prognosis depends on severity and treatment response.

---

A 74-year-old man with exertional tremor in the non-dominant arm most likely has **ET or early PD**; careful clinical evaluation and, if needed, DaTscan can clarify the diagnosis and guide therapy [^1147YBZD].

Conclusions

We have proposed a stepwise diagnostic approach to patients presenting with upper limb tremor, to guide clinicians in establishing a clinical tremor syndrome and performing the relevant tests to determine its aetiology. The proposed diagnostic algorithm is in line with the latest Consensus Statementand encourages clinicians to make a distinction between isolated and combined tremor syndromes, based on clinical features. This is key, as this distinction subsequently informs our choices for diagnostic testing. We believe that our diagnostic algorithm will be useful to practising neurologists whether they have expertise in the field of movement disorders or not. The stepwise setup tapers diagnostic tests, starting with those tests that are easily available and indicated in most patients, and finishing with more specialised diagnostic procedures, including considerations for next-generation genetic testing. By following the presented steps, the long list of possible causes for tremor is reduced to manageable portions. We hope that the approach proposed in this article will decrease diagnostic uncertainty and increase the diagnostic yield in patients with tremor.

The diagnosis and management of essential tremor appears deceptively simple. However, isolated mild tremor may be difficult to classify, and if the patients have any additional features the diagnosis is more difficult. Management can be challenging, despite the numerous treatments available, because so many patients are not benefited adequately and some not at all. However, as we gain a better understanding of the disorder, more effective therapies with fewer adverse effects are sure to follow.

### Is essential tremor a single entity? [^1126S6r3]. European Journal of Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Essential tremor (ET) is a frequent movement disorder. The new tremor classification has subdivided ET into the classical form with bilateral action tremor of the hands with or without involvement of further tremor locations and without any other explaining signs or symptoms for the tremor and into 'ET plus' which comes additionally with further neurological signs of unknown origin. This will provide a better foundation for subclassifying the condition. The immediate cause of ET is a preformed oscillating network within the central nervous system as revealed with electrophysiological methods. The reason why this network is getting into the tremor mode is unclear. Pathology has so far not convincingly proved neurodegeneration for the condition but possibly adaptive changes of the brain particularly in the cerebellum are likely. Genetics have not yet provided insight into the molecular causes of the condition but several genetic diseases presenting with an ET syndrome have been uncovered. Treatment options cover medication (propranolol, primidone, topiramate) and surgical interventions with deep brain stimulation, gamma-knife surgery and the recently introduced magnetic resonance imaging guided focused ultrasound lesioning. Further progress is awaited from the better integration of large prospective cohort assessment and basic science studies on the possible etiologies. In particular, aging-related tremor may explain a large number of the patients seen in clinical practice. Currently ET is considered a clinically relatively uniform condition with presumably various underlying etiologies.

### Systematic clinical approach for diagnosing upper limb tremor [^114id34R]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Tremor is the most common movement disorder worldwide, but diagnosis is challenging. In 2018, the task force on tremor of the International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society published a consensus statement that proposes a tremor classification along two independent axes: a clinical tremor syndrome and its underlying aetiology. In line with this statement, we here propose a stepwise diagnostic approach that leads to the correct clinical and aetiological classification of upper limb tremor. We also describe the typical clinical signs of each clinical tremor syndrome. A key feature of our algorithm is the distinction between isolated and combined tremor syndromes, in which tremor is accompanied by bradykinesia, cerebellar signs, dystonia, peripheral neuropathy or brainstem signs. This distinction subsequently informs the selection of appropriate diagnostic tests, such as neurophysiology, laboratory testing, structural and dopaminergic imaging and genetic testing. We highlight treatable metabolic causes of tremor, as well as drugs and toxins that can provoke tremor. The stepwise approach facilitates appropriate diagnostic testing and avoids unnecessary investigations. We expect that the approach offered in this article will reduce diagnostic uncertainty and increase the diagnostic yield in patients with tremor.

### Essential tremor: differential diagnosis and current therapy [^115LgxhE]. The American Journal of Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Essential tremor is a common movement disorder that affects between 5 and 10 million persons in the United States. It is characterized primarily by an action and postural tremor most often affecting the arms, but it can also affect other body parts. Essential tremor is a progressive neurologic disorder and can cause substantial disability in some patients. Although there is no cure for essential tremor, pharmacologic and surgical treatments can provide some benefit. Primidone and propranolol are first-line treatments. Other medications with potential efficacy include benzodiazepines, gabapentin, topiramate, and botulinum toxin. Patients with medication-resistant tremor may benefit from thalamotomy or deep brain stimulation of the thalamus. The use of medical and surgical therapies can provide benefit in up to 80% of patients with essential tremor.

### Essential tremor-the most common movement disorder in older people [^116svrix]. Age and Ageing (2006). Low credibility.

Essential tremor (ET) affects approximately 4% of the population above 65 years of age. The traditional view that ET is a familial monosymptomatic disorder with a benign prognosis has recently been challenged, as it is now known to be a progressive and clinically heterogeneous condition with sporadic and familial forms. The pathogenesis of ET is not fully understood, though a disordered central mechanism is the most likely site of origin with possible modulation by muscle adrenoreceptors. The limited post-mortem studies have not shown consistent abnormalities in the brains of ET patients. ET is often misdiagnosed as Parkinson's disease, particularly in the older population. Tremor amplitude increases with age, accounting for substantial disability in older people. Current therapy (drugs and neurosurgery) has significant limitations in older people. A better understanding of its pathophysiology in the future will help in developing more effective therapy, including neuroprotective strategies.

Introduction

The management of essential tremor covers two important aspects. The first is diagnostic with the main questions is for accuracy of diagnosis and not to overlook specifically treatable etiologies. A new tremor classification has laid new foundations for this. The second is to understand and interpret the needs of the patient. The spectrum of complaints varies considerably from patient to patient. Essential tremor (ET) is a lifelong lasting syndrome and young patients may have different demands than the elderly. Essential tremor is a progressive syndrome and patients early during the course of the disease may have different problems from those with advanced ET. Men and female can both have essential tremor but the complaints may differ for them. For all these aspects, it is important to know about the spectrum of manifestations of the condition but also about the ways to measure tremor severity and complaints. The selection of treatment is critically depending on the knowledge of these subjective complaints.

### Essential tremor: emerging views of a common disorder [^113wfjm1]. Nature Clinical Practice: Neurology (2006). Medium credibility.

Essential tremor (ET) is the most prevalent tremor disorder. ET has traditionally been viewed as a monosymptomatic disorder characterized by a kinetic arm tremor, but this definition is gradually being replaced. The clinical spectrum has come to include several motor features, including tremor and ataxia, and several non-motor features, including possible cognitive impairment and personality disturbances. Postmortem studies are revealing several different patterns of pathology. The emerging view is that ET might be a family of diseases, unified by the presence of kinetic tremor, but further characterized by etiological, clinical and pathological heterogeneity. Effective pharmacological treatments for the disorder remain limited, although new insights into disease mechanisms might result in more-effective therapies. In addition, recent investigations of environmental toxicants that might be linked to ET open the way towards primary disease prevention through a reduction in exposure to these factors.

### Essential tremor: tips and tricks [^112E58Dk]. Practical Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Tremors are a common reason for neurology consultations and can sometimes be a diagnostic challenge. One of the most common causes is essential tremor, which needs to be distinguished from other types of tremors, such as those found in Parkinson's disease, cerebellar disease or dystonic tremor. This categorisation is important as their treatment and prognosis differ. This review focuses on two main characteristics of tremor to help with its differential diagnosis: 'The When', or conditions that enhance the tremor, which include action, postural, intentional components and resting tremor; and 'The Where' or the body location, which includes tremor in the upper limbs, head or voice.

### Essential tremor: a nuanced approach to the clinical features [^1126yXkc]. Practical Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Click here to listen to the Podcast Essential tremor is the most common form of tremor in humans. Given neurologists' high exposure to this condition, and its seemingly straightforward phenotype, it might seem easy to diagnose. However, 30%-50% of patients labelled as having 'essential tremor' have other diagnoses, mostly Parkinson's disease and dystonia. The tremor of essential tremor is neither non-descript nor featureless but is multifaceted and highly patterned. This review focuses on its clinical features, beginning with a discussion of tremors and then briefly discussing its additional motor features, and presents several aids to help distinguish essential tremor from Parkinson's disease and dystonia. Careful attention to certain clinical nuances will aid the diagnosis and care of patients with essential tremor.

### Systematic clinical approach for diagnosing upper limb tremor [^115Hd484]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

If there are additional signs 'of uncertain significance' in a patient who otherwise fulfils the criteria for ET, then the recent consensus classifies this as ET plus. This could be impaired tandem gait, questionable dystonic posturing, memory impairment or other mild neurological signs. Likewise, ET with tremor at rest should be classified here. Over the last few years, there has been considerable discussion over the term 'ET plus'. A recent study showed that, in ET patients with lower limb tremor, 110/133 (83%) were re-classified as ET plus, and these patients were older than the ET group. This shows that many patients with ET have additional symptoms, which may be integral to the disease, reflect comorbidity or it may be related to ageing. Another issue is that it is not easy to determine the clinical significance of additional symptoms. Specifically, two recent studies have shown that there is only fair agreement between movement disorders experts when assessing soft signs, and modest inter-rater agreement between axis 1 diagnoses (especially between ET plus and dystonic tremor). Neurophysiological measures, such as temporal discrimination thresholds, also cannot provide clear distinctions between ET and dystonic tremor, although this may be useful when classifying indeterminate tremors. These findings show that the borders between some clinical tremor syndromes are not fixed, which may indicate a shared pathophysiological basis. Accordingly, it has been argued that 'ET plus' may represent a state condition, such that additional signs emerge during certain stages of ET, or a temporary label, such that patients with ET plus transition to a more definite diagnosis. In the future, incorporation of pathophysiological information (a potential 'third axis') may help to better classify tremor syndromes, but this requires better biomarkers than are currently available. Until then, we recommend to not rest at a diagnosis of 'ET plus', and to explicitly note and follow the relevant 'plus symptom'. The general principle that axis 1 classifications may change over time is, however, not specific to ET plus.

### Essential pitfalls in "essential" tremor [^116Cu73d]. Movement Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

Although essential tremor has been considered the most common movement disorder, it has largely remained a diagnosis of exclusion: many tremor and nontremor features must be absent for the clinical diagnosis to stand. The clinical features of "essential tremor" overlap with or may be part of other tremor disorders and, not surprisingly, this prevalent familial disorder has remained without a gene identified, without a consistent natural history, and without an acceptable pathology or pathophysiologic underpinning. The collective evidence suggests that under the rubric of essential tremor there exists multiple unique diseases, some of which represent cerebellar dysfunction, but for which there is no intrinsic "essence" other than a common oscillatory behavior on posture and action. One approach may be to use the term essential tremor only as a transitional node in the deep phenotyping of tremor disorders based on historical, phenomenological, and neurophysiological features to facilitate its etiologic diagnosis or serve for future gene- and biomarker-discovery efforts. This approach deemphasizes essential tremor as a diagnostic entity and facilitates the understanding of the underlying disorders to develop biologically tailored diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. © 2017 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.

### Essential tremor [^114Vn2eM]. The Lancet: Neurology (2005). Medium credibility.

Essential tremor (ET) is one of the most common neurological diseases; although it is a disease about which we are only beginning to develop an understanding. Effective treatment options for the disorder are severely limited. The traditional view of ET as a benign, familial, monosymptomatic disorder is being replaced by one of ET as a disease or family of diseases with aetiological, clinical, and pathological heterogeneity. Recent identification of putative environmental toxins linked to ET provide hope for disease prevention through a reduction in exposure to risk factors. Pathological and genetic studies will yield new insights into disease pathogenesis and mechanisms, which may result in the development of more effective symptomatic therapies developed with an understanding of the disease biology. These insights also have the potential to form the basis for neuroprotective therapies.

The Essential Tremor Syndrome and Its Etiologies

The new classification of MDS is based on a 2-axis principle. The clinical phenomenology of tremor is mapped on axis 1 (clinical description) and the tremor etiology on axis 2. The axis 1 descriptors (historical features, tremor characteristics, associated signs, and additional laboratory tests) allow a syndromic classification based on these features. Essential tremor is defined as an isolated tremor syndrome of bilateral upper limb action tremor with or without tremor in other locations of at least a 3-year duration. Other neurologic symptoms sufficient to make an additional neurologic syndrome diagnosis (e.g. Parkinson syndrome, dystonia, cerebellar disease, peripheral neuropathy…) must be absent. Based on clinical experience, such patients very often have slight symptoms called "soft signs" (impaired tandem gait, obvious tremor at rest, questionable dystonic posturing, memory impairment etc.) which are suspicious but not sufficient to allow a second diagnosis. These patients are defined as having "essential tremor plus (ET+)". This entity has been defined because an unknown number of these patients may later develop other diagnoses and may be a matter of discussion even among specialists. On the long run, closer definitions are needed here. Compared to the previous definition of essential tremor in the 1998 classification, two recent studies have shown that only ~ 15% or 46% are classified as ET but more than 80% or 54% were classified as ET+ according to the 2018 classification. The message is that the majority of ET patients seems to have such soft signs.

Treatable conditions which may present mainly with tremor. Syndromes including tremor can be treated according to the underlying etiology of the disease.

Syndromes attributable to monogenetic diseases or syndromes attributable to chromosomal aberrations are, with a few exceptions, not yet causally treatable.

If there are causal therapeutic approaches, i.e. if the etiology of the tremor is known (for example: side effect of a medication, concomitant symptom of another disease or syndrome, genetic cause, causal toxin), the tremor should be treated according to the needs of the condition and the individual suffering due to tremor.

### A 50-year-old man with left-sided weakness and difficulty speaking clearly [^1163LWJS]. NEJM Evidence (2025). Medium credibility.

Morning Report is a time-honored tradition where physicians-in-training present cases to their colleagues and clinical experts to collaboratively examine an interesting patient presentation. The Morning Report section seeks to carry on this tradition by presenting a patient's chief concern and story, inviting the reader to develop a differential diagnosis and discover the diagnosis alongside the authors of the case. This report examines the story of a 50-year-old man who presented for evaluation of weakness on the left side of his body and difficulty speaking clearly. Using questions, physical examination, and testing, an illness script for the presentation emerges; the differential is refined until a diagnosis is made.

### Estimating annual rate of decline: prospective, longitudinal data on arm tremor severity in two groups of essential tremor cases [^112WWj7C]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Despite its high prevalence, there are surprisingly few prospective, longitudinal data on the clinical course of essential tremor (ET). Patients themselves often want to know from their treating physician whether and by how much their tremor is expected to worsen over time.

Methods

As part of two research protocols, prospective, longitudinal data were collected on tremor severity in two samples of ET cases (44+39 cases, combined n = 83). At a baseline and one follow-up evaluation, a detailed clinical assessment was performed and action tremor in the arms was rated by a senior movement disorders neurologist using a standardised clinical rating scale (Total Tremor Score (TTS), range 0–36).

Results

In the first case sample, TTS increased annually by 0.32 ± 0.89 points (ie, an annual increase of 5.3 ± 17.1% (median 1.8%) from the mean baseline score). TTS increased by ≥ 0.5 points in 23/24 (95.8%) cases followed for ≥ 5 years. In the second sample, TTS score increased annually by 0.64 ± 1.49 points (annual increase of 3.1 ± 8.1% (median 2.0%) from the mean baseline score). TTS increased by ≥ 0.5 points in 11/15 (73.3%) cases followed for ≥ 5 years. No baseline factors were identified that predicted annual change in TTS.

Conclusions

Most ET cases exhibited a progressive worsening in tremor scores with time such that the average annual increase in tremor severity from baseline was estimated to be between 3.1% and 5.3% and the median annual increase from baseline was between 1.8% and 2.0%. These published estimates will hopefully be a useful prognostic guide for clinicians and their patients.

### Essential tremor-plus: a controversial new concept [^116gX3w4]. The Lancet: Neurology (2020). High credibility.

In addition to redefining essential tremor (ET), the 2018 consensus statement of the Movement Disorder Society on tremor coined a new term: essential tremor-plus (ET-plus). This term is uncertainly defined as tremor with the characteristics of ET, with additional neurological signs of uncertain clinical significance. If ET-plus had been defined on the basis of a difference in underlying pathology or an appreciable difference in prognosis, it would have a valid, scientific rationale, as does the term Parkinson-plus. However, there is no such evidence, so the basis for the term is questionable. In fact, ET-plus might only represent a state condition (ie, patients with ET might develop these additional clinical features when the disease is at a more advanced stage). We caution against coining new terms that are not supported by a firm scientific basis and encourage research into the creation of essential tremor subsets that are defined with respect to differences in underlying causes or pathophysiology.

### Essential tremor: diagnosis and management [^1112p28G]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Essential tremor is one of the most common movement disorders in adults and can affect both children and adults. An updated consensus statement in 2018 redefined essential tremor as an isolated action tremor present in bilateral upper extremities for at least three years. Tremor may also be present in other locations, commonly the neck or the vocal cords. Patients with additional neurologic symptoms are now categorized as "essential tremor plus". Additional clinical features associated with the condition include but are not limited to cognitive impairment, psychiatric disorders, and hearing loss. When treatment is needed, propranolol and primidone are considered first line treatments. Patients who are severely affected are often offered deep brain stimulation. Although the ventral intermediate nucleus of the thalamus is the traditional surgical target, the caudal zona incerta is also being studied as a possible superior alternative. Magnetic resonance imaging guided high intensity focused ultrasound is a newer surgical alternative that may be ideal for patients with substantial medical comorbidities. Current research explores novel oral treatments, chemodenervation, and noninvasive neuromodulation for treatment of essential tremor.

A 69-year-old man was evaluated in our neurology department, for a presumed diagnosis of 'night-time seizures'; however, this diagnosis was quickly dismissed after the patient (and his wife) described how he 'acted out' and talked throughout his dreams, without any seizure-like activity. This problem had been present for ∼10years. An EEG ruled out epilepsy. The patient also described a 10-year history of constipation, loss of smell and 'frequent collapses'. These symptoms fit in with the recently published criteria of 'prodromal Parkinson's Disease' and prompted a formal assessment for Parkinson's disease (PD). He had no tremor. A subtle festinating gait pattern and a 2-finger tremor in the right hand were noted. The diagnosis of PD was confirmed by a dopamine transporter scan. Clinically, this is one-Park sleep: rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder subtype-of 7 different non-motor dominant PD phenotypes recently described.

### Tremor stability index: a new tool for differential diagnosis in tremor syndromes [^116wAPGf]. Brain (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Misdiagnosis in tremor syndromes is a common and often underestimated problem that can cause misleading results in clinical trials. At the clinical level misdiagnosis may lead to suboptimal treatment and incorrect prognosis. Central to this problem is the lack of accurate diagnostic tools that can distinguish different tremor aetiologies. Indeed, the diagnostic accuracy of Parkinson's disease turns out to be only moderate when assessed against the gold standard of post-mortem histology. Overall, diagnostic accuracy has been estimated to be 80% amongst movement disorders experts, and 74% if the disease is diagnosed by a neurologist not expert in movement disorders. Thus, even using the UK Brain Bank criteria for Parkinson's disease as a proxy for post-mortem examination, about 2 in 10 patients with Parkinson's disease still receive a misdiagnosis, and this figure may be even higher in those presenting with Parkinson's disease tremor.

In essential tremor there is no gold standard diagnostic procedure, not even at post-mortem, and diagnosis is made purely on clinically-defined criteria. Thirty-seven per cent of essential tremor patients are misdiagnosed, with the most common misdiagnosis being Parkinson's disease tremor. The differential diagnosis of essential tremor and Parkinson's disease tremor is especially difficult early in the course of the disease when other parkinsonian signs may be absent and the clinician does not have the benefit of knowing the disease course. Moreover, patient age is not a discriminant factor, since early onset Parkinson's disease and late onset essential tremor are part of the spectrum of these two diseases, and this often underlies the cases in which differential diagnosis is most difficult.

Clinically, Parkinson's disease tremor is present at rest, while tremor in essential tremor is postural and/or kinetic. However, Parkinson's disease tremor may also manifest as a postural tremor, which generally appears a few seconds after assuming a posture — 're-emergent' tremor. Nevertheless, this tremor onset delay can be absent in some patients with Parkinson's disease, showing a pure postural tremor. Conversely, if patients with essential tremor are not fully relaxed during the muscular tone evaluation, tremor can lead to the false impression of a cogwheel phenomenon.

This baseline FDG PET showed normal thalamic metabolism. At 12 months post-treatment, FDG PET scan revealed a small focus of left thalamic hypometabolism, which corresponded to the left DRTT ablation area seen on post-treatment MRI. The patient was tremor-free in his right hand at 1-year follow-up. This case documents the chronic effects of MRgHIFU on cerebral FDG metabolism.

### Consensus statement on the classification of tremors. from the task force on tremor of the International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society [^115LtVqJ]. Movement Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Consensus criteria for classifying tremor disorders were published by the International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society in 1998. Subsequent advances with regard to essential tremor, tremor associated with dystonia, and other monosymptomatic and indeterminate tremors make a significant revision necessary.

Objectives

Convene an international panel of experienced investigators to review the definition and classification of tremor.

Methods

Computerized MEDLINE searches in January 2013 and 2015 were conducted using a combination of text words and MeSH terms: "tremor", "tremor disorders", "essential tremor", "dystonic tremor", and "classification" limited to human studies. Agreement was obtained using consensus development methodology during four in-person meetings, two teleconferences, and numerous manuscript reviews.

Results

Tremor is defined as an involuntary, rhythmic, oscillatory movement of a body part and is classified along two axes: Axis 1-clinical characteristics, including historical features (age at onset, family history, and temporal evolution), tremor characteristics (body distribution, activation condition), associated signs (systemic, neurological), and laboratory tests (electrophysiology, imaging); and Axis 2-etiology (acquired, genetic, or idiopathic). Tremor syndromes, consisting of either isolated tremor or tremor combined with other clinical features, are defined within Axis 1. This classification scheme retains the currently accepted tremor syndromes, including essential tremor, and provides a framework for defining new syndromes.

Conclusions

This approach should be particularly useful in elucidating isolated tremor syndromes and syndromes consisting of tremor and other signs of uncertain significance. Consistently defined Axis 1 syndromes are needed to facilitate the elucidation of specific etiologies in Axis 2. © 2017 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.

### Long duration asymmetrical postural tremor is likely to predict development of Parkinson's disease and not essential tremor: clinical follow up study of 13 cases [^1119Qsww]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Patients presenting with asymmetrical postural tremor with or without mild rest tremor may be diagnosed as having essential tremor (ET), although there is considerable diagnostic uncertainty as to the long term outcome of these patients.

Objective

In this study, retrospective observations were made on 13 patients presenting originally with asymmetrical postural tremor, initially thought to have ET based on tremor characteristics, alcohol responsiveness, and family history but who subsequently met the criteria of Parkinson's disease (PD).

Methods

The patients were observed and followed up clinically with ancillary imaging using dopamine transporter SPECT scan or levodopa challenge tests in some cases. The diagnosis at original presentation with postural tremor was made with retrospective case note review.

Results

After a variable and long latent period all patients developed additional signs suggesting a clinical diagnosis of PD although picking up an initial label of ET.

Conclusions

We suggest exercising caution regarding a diagnosis of ET in patients presenting with late onset asymmetrical postural tremor even if there is no rest tremor. Alcohol sensitivity of tremor, family history of tremor, or responsiveness to beta blockers may not be helpful in diagnosing ET in these cases and some may develop PD in the long term.

### The essential tremor syndromes [^114TjnPu]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Essential tremor has not been defined or used consistently in clinical diagnosis and research. Other monosymptomatic disorders are often referred to as essential tremor variants.

Recent Findings

There is now solid evidence that essential tremor, however defined, is a syndrome with multiple causes.

Summary

A new tremor classification scheme is being developed by the International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society Task Force on Tremor. In this scheme, tremor in the absence of other neurological signs is called isolated tremor, and tremor in combination with other signs is called combined tremor. Many isolated and combined tremor syndromes can be defined on the basis of commonly recurring or unique clinical symptoms and signs, including historical features (age at onset, family history, and temporal evolution) and tremor characteristics (body distribution, activation condition, associated features). Essential tremor, however defined, is simply a syndrome and not a specific disease. Essential tremor should be defined and used consistently, or this term should be abandoned. As essential tremor is an arbitrarily defined syndrome, it makes no sense to refer to other tremors as variants of essential tremor or essential tremor syndromes.

### The MDS consensus tremor classification: the best way to classify patients with tremor at present [^114ouQUz]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2022). Medium credibility.

In 2018, the new Consensus Statement on the Classification of Tremors, by the Task Force on Tremor of the International Parkinson Movement Disorder Society, was published. So far, the article has been cited more than 400 times in peer-reviewed international journals and commonly debated in conferences and meetings due to an enthusiastic welcome from the community. Compared to the previous Consensus Statement (1998), the main novelties are: 1) the classification of tremor according to clinical manifestation (Axis 1) and etiology (Axis 2), and therefore the use of a syndromic approach; 2) the definition of essential tremor as a syndrome; 3) the recognition of the new category essential tremor plus, that derives from the uncertain significance of the soft neurological signs often associated with essential tremor. In this paper, we summarise and explain the most important aspects of the new classification of tremors, highlighting the main novelties, their relevance, and application in clinical practice. Moreover, we discuss its possible weakness and reflect on the critical comments made so far. We believe that this new tremor classification is comprehensive, rigorous, and consistent and, considering our current knowledge of tremor syndromes, it is the best we can do at present. This article is part of the Special Issue "Tremor" edited by Daniel D. Truong, Mark Hallett, and Aasef Shaikh.

### Revisiting the relationship between essential tremor and Parkinson's disease [^117H7uNg]. Movement Disorders (2011). Low credibility.

Background

The relationship between essential tremor and Parkinson's disease has been a subject of reviews and debates for long time, but there is now growing evidence that the two common movement disorders are pathogenically related, at least in some patient populations.

Methods

PubMed as well as authors' own files were searched for relevant keywords regarding overlap between the disorders in clinical features as well as on epidemiologic, genetic, imaging, and pathological studies.

Results

New findings in each of these categories are critically reviewed and placed in the context of previously published data.

Discussion

Although we believe that there is compelling evidence for the notion that some patients with "pure" ET evolve into PD, the biologic nature of the association is not well understood. Furthermore, it is not clear what factors predict which ET patients later develop PD and whether patients with PD are more likely to develop ET. Further epidemiologic, clinical, genetic, imaging, and pathological studies are needed to better understand this mixed, ET-PD phenotype.

### Managing essential tremor [^1121XPxW]. Neurotherapeutics (2020). Medium credibility.

Essential tremor is one of the most common tremor syndromes. According to the recent tremor classification, tremor as a symptom is defined as an involuntary, rhythmic, oscillatory movement of a body part and is classified along two axes: axis 1 — defining syndromes based on the clinical features such as historical features, tremor characteristics, associated signs, and laboratory tests; and axis 2 — classifying the etiology (Bhatia et al. Mov Disord 33:75–87). The management of this condition has two major approaches. The first is to exclude treatable etiologies, as particularly during the onset of this condition the presentation of a variety of etiologies can be with monosymptomatic tremor. Once the few etiologies with causal treatments are excluded, all further treatment is symptomatic. Shared decision-making with enabling the patient to knowledgeably choose treatment options is needed to customize the management. Mild to moderate tremor severity can sometimes be controlled with occupational treatment, speech therapy of psychotherapy, or adaptation of coping strategy. First-line pharmacological treatments include symptomatic treatment with propranolol, primidone, and topiramate. Botulinum toxin is for selected cases. Invasive treatments for essential tremor should be considered for severe tremors. They are generally accepted as the most powerful interventions and provide not only improvement of tremor but also a significant improvement of life quality. The current standard is deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the thalamic and subthalamic region. Focused ultrasound thalamotomy is a new therapy attracting increasing interest. Radiofrequency lesioning is only rarely done if DBS or focused ultrasound is not possible. Radiosurgery is not well established. We present our treatment algorithm.

### An update on tremors [^1123sCT7]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review describes the most recent advances in epidemiology, classification, genetics, pathology and treatment of essential tremor. In addition, recent advances in more rare forms of tremor are summarized.

Recent Findings

Clinical, biochemical, pathological and imaging studies suggest an abnormal functioning of the cerebellum in essential tremor. Minor changes of cognition and personality may be due to secondary effects. Dementia and possible shortened life span seem to be limited to late-onset essential tremor. Many of these issues are not yet finally settled and need confirmation in further studies. The current essential tremor classification seems not to reflect the variety of phenotypic expressions. Regarding treatment, there is now a level B evidence for topiramate. Levetiracetam may induce a positive response in Holmes tremor, but is ineffective in orthostatic tremor.

Summary

These findings have extended our knowledge about essential tremor. It appears that a new, more distinct classification system is required. Recent treatments have remained unchanged.

### Problems and controversies in tremor classification [^116gShcr]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2022). Medium credibility.

The Consensus Statement on the Classification of Tremors, from the Task Force of the International Parkinson's and Movement Disorder Society was published in 2018 in response to advances in the understanding of essential tremor (ET), tremor associated with dystonia and other monosymptomatic and indeterminate tremors. This was a revision of the previous 1998 Consensus Statement. A number of problems arise from this classification and, in this manuscript, we highlight several of these. These problems relate to the definition of tremor, the definition of ET, the proposal of the term 'essential tremor plus', issues related to orthostatic tremor (OT) including the proposal of the term 'orthostatic tremor plus', and the absence of a hierarchy of terms used to classify tremor. Among the proposals we make is that the definition of tremor should acknowledge that tremor is a symptom, ET should be redefined, severity is an important characteristic for classifying and diagnosing tremor, the terms 'essential tremor plus' and 'orthostatic tremor plus' should be abandoned, and classification of tremor requires rules for creating a hierarchy of terminology.

### Quality improvement in neurology: essential tremor quality measurement set [^112BVxyo]. Neurology (2017). Medium credibility.

Essential tremor (ET) prevalence, clinical features, and patient-reported care needs for quality improvement are summarized, including that ET has prevalence rates "ranging from 0.4% to 4.6%" and "is estimated to affect as many as 7 to 10 million Americans", with "the average age at onset in mid-to-late 40s". Clinically, ET is "characterized by bilateral, symmetric, postural tremor in hands and forearms, with or without kinetic tremor, in the absence of abnormal posturing or task specificity", can "affect lower extremities, head, and voice", and symptoms may be "barely noticeable, or severe and disabling". In a patient survey, "only 1 in 10 patients with ET indicated they were satisfied in their current treatment situation", and requested services included "psychological services and support (33.9%)" and "physical or occupational therapy (28.6%)", as well as "hiding embarrassment and social effects of tremor (15.8%)", "feelings of not being in control (13.7%)", "better counseling about current treatment and medications (11.9%)", "discussion of more treatment options or alternative treatment options (8.7%)", and "support groups (4.9%)", with needs for "more quantitative ways of assessing ET (12.5%)" and "tracking progression of the condition (12.7%)". The American Academy of Neurology (AAN) "seated a multidisciplinary work group to evaluate evidence and identify areas where quality improvement efforts could be focused and harmonized to meet patient and provider needs", and the group "reviewed existing guideline statements and attempted to locate research data supporting guideline use in practice. It is hoped that by developing quality measures additional information can be ascertained on clinical performance of guideline recommendations".

CASES

Patient 1 is a 42‐year‐old Slovakian man who presented with progressive proximal lower limb weakness which began in his early 30s, first noted as a difficulty walking and climbing stairs, having been developmentally normal and physically active into adulthood. Examination was significant for symmetric, predominantly proximal lower limb weakness and a positive Gowers' sign. There was mild distal upper limb weakness. Fasciculations and wasting were noted in the quadriceps. Reflexes were absent at the knees and the ankles but present and not brisk elsewhere. There were no cerebellar, pyramidal or extrapyramidal signs. One additional case with a pure neuromuscular phenotype (patient 2) is presented with slowly progressive lower limb girdle weakness without additional findings on examination 30 years after initial presentation. Patients 3 and 4 also presented with neuromuscular weakness and, although this was the dominant feature of the presentation, cerebellar and pyramidal signs were found on examination; patient 4 had a tremor since childhood which was felt to be extrapyramidal (see Table 1).

Introduction

Tremor syndromes are among the most common neurological disorders. Of these, essential tremor affects up to 4.6% of the global population ≥ 65 years old. This disorder is characterised by a mixture of postural and kinetic tremors, which likely represent diverse facets of pathological oscillations in brain motor networks –. Tremor is often accompanied by additional neurological signs such as dystonia or ataxia. As such, tremor is also a common symptom in a range of acquired and genetic neurological disorders, posing a significant diagnostic challenge in clinical neurology. This translates into high rates of misdiagnosed tremor disorders, which has profound therapeutic implications in particular for deep brain stimulation (DBS), a potent neural circuit therapy for tremor disorders. DBS outcomes largely hinge on accurate patient selection, which itself is influenced by accurate tremor assessment. The complexity of tremor syndromes has been a roadblock to pathogenetic and diagnostic research, which culminated in a call to redefine tremor classification through quantitative phenotyping.

To this end, instrumented tremor analysis offers an unbiased and detailed assessment of key tremor features, such as frequency and amplitude, which are crucial for phenotyping, therapeutic monitoring, differential diagnosis – and closed-loop neuromodulation. 3D motion capture methods enable comprehensive characterisation of both tremor and associated movement abnormalities (reviewed in ref.). However, the reliance on these complex and resource-intensive methods restricts their practical use, especially in routine clinical settings.

In contemporary practice, the complex phenomenology of tremor syndromes is therefore condensed into low dimensional, ordinal rating scales. These scales represent tremor items in a non-linear, logarithmic manner, and, despite their simplicity, suffer from considerable clinimetric limitations. One of these limitations is interrater reliability, reported to be as low as 0.1 (Cohen's kappa).

### Sporadic creutzfeldt-jakob disease [^1176wBR6]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Being considered among the most fatal neurological conditions, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy characterized by its unknown etiology and rapidly progressive neurodegenerative symptoms that often lead to a mean survival of 6 to 12 months. The accumulation of the prionic protein causes brain matter degeneration, which leads to a set of clinical findings that include rapidly progressive dementia, myoclonus, tremors, cerebellar ataxia, and extrapyramidal signs. This clinical presentation is non-specific, which makes CJD a very difficult condition to diagnose, due to the low level of clinical suspicion. However, combining this clinical presentation with neuroimaging, a lumbar puncture and an encephalogram will help us make the correct diagnosis. We present the case of a 57-year-old male presenting to the Emergency department with complaint of personality change and intermittent memory loss. The patient's physical exam was significant for resting pill roll tremor, bilateral cogwheel rigidity, dysmetria, and shuffling gait. Magnetic resonance imaging of his brain showed symmetric bilateral diffusion signal abnormality involving the cortex, bilateral caudate heads and putamina. Continuous electroencephalogram revealed multiple bifrontal delta discharges with triphasic morphology. Lumbar puncture was significant for presence of 14–3–3 protein in cerebrospinal fluid. The multiple examinations performed in conjunction with the previous findings supported the diagnosis of acute encephalopathy secondary to sporadic CJD.

### Moving toward "laboratory-supported" criteria for psychogenic tremor [^111i7vsP]. Movement Disorders (2011). Low credibility.

A confident clinical diagnosis of psychogenic tremor is often possible, but, in some cases, a "laboratory-supported" level of certainty would aid in early positive diagnosis. Various electrophysiological tests have been suggested to identify patients with psychogenic tremor, but their diagnostic reliability has never been assessed "head to head" nor compared to forms of organic tremor other than essential tremor or PD. We compared baseline tremor characteristics (e.g. frequency and amplitude) as well as electrophysiological tests previously reported to distinguish psychogenic and organic tremor in a cohort of 13 patients with psychogenic tremor and 25 patients with organic tremor, the latter including PD, essential-, dystonic-, and neuropathic tremors. We assessed between-group differences and calculated sensitivity and specificity for each test. A number of tests, including entrainment or frequency changes with tapping, pause of tremor during contralateral ballistic movements, increase in tremor amplitude with loading, presence of coherence, and tonic coactivation at tremor onset, revealed significant differences on a group level, but there was no single test with adequate sensitivity and specificity for separating the groups (33%–77% and 84%–100%, respectively). However, a combination of electrophysiological tests was able to distinguish psychogenic and organic tremor with excellent sensitivity and specificity. A laboratory-supported level of diagnostic certainty in psychogenic tremor is likely to require a battery of electrophysiological tests to provide sufficient specificity and sensitivity. Our data suggest such a battery that, if supported in a prospective study, may form the basis of laboratory-supported criteria for the diagnosis of psychogenic tremor. © 2011 Movement Disorder Society

Overarching Aspects of the Treatment of Essential Tremor

If the etiology is unknown as for most of the patients only symptoms are treated, the threshold to treat should be based on patient-physician consensus. The decision on the extent for a symptomatic treatment should relate to the impairment subjectively felt by the patient due to both the motor symptoms and secondary impairment (psychosocial aspects). Not only objective tremor severity but also the patient subjective suffering and the related coping strategy are relevant. Important questions are the temporal development of tremor, facilitating and attenuating situations, topographic distribution of tremor, tremor components which are most disturbing, and the activities affected most by tremor. Complaints related to psychosocial aspects of the syndrome such as fear of stigmatization, social isolation, and depression due to tremor should impact the therapeutic decision-making. Some studies found an increased incidence of depression in ET while others found no differences but this leaves the clinician with the need of an individual assessment of such symptoms for each patient. For tremors, the subjective perception of impairment is extremely variable between individuals and does not correlate very well with the measurable amplitude of the tremor, nor with the duration of the tremor and therefore the coping strategies differ. Also, many patients, particularly those with mild symptoms, are mainly seeking advice on the etiology of the condition and want to have Parkinson's disease excluded.

Results

In all, 1009 patients above 18 years were detected in the database. Of these, 99 were excluded due to a lack of a final or a non‐movement disorder clinical diagnosis, and 36 due to more than one diagnosis (an FMD plus non‐FMD). A total of 874 patients were eligible for inclusion in the study, of whom 554 (63%) had a non‐FMD, including tremor 131 (24%), myoclonus 51 (10%), dystonia 257 (46%) and others 115 (20%). The remaining 320 (37%) were diagnosed with an FMD. In this group, the key symptom was tremor in 66 patients (21%), myoclonus in 102 patients (32%), dystonia in 82 patients (26%) and others (21%). In the non‐FMD group, 224 patients (40%) had more than one motor phenotype including dystonic tremor in 36%, myoclonus‐dystonia in 10%, medication‐induced movement disorders in 9%, and in the remaining 45% several other combinations were detected. In our FMD group 70 (24%) of the patients had more than one hyperkinetic movement disorder. All patients were diagnosed by an experienced movement disorder specialist. In more than 50% of the patients with functional tremor or myoclonus the diagnosis was supported by electrophysiological testing. Table 1 shows the mean and standard deviation of age at onset and the frequency of the associated categorical features for patients with FMDs versus non‐FMDs. It was assumed that clinical characteristics, such as medical history or family history, were reported properly by the attending physician and therefore these items were scored as absent when they were not reported. In the case of unreported associated features, such as pain or fatigue, these missing values were replaced by absent. The percentage of missing values that were replaced is reported in the last column of the table. In FMD patients, symptoms had a significantly higher age of onset than in non‐FMD patients. The features sex, psychiatric history, pain, fatigue, abrupt onset, waxing and waning over long term, and fluctuations during the day were more common (P < 0.01) in patients with FMDs, whilst more than one motor phenotype and positive family history were more prevalent in patients with non‐FMDs (P < 0.01). The frequency of cognitive symptoms and medical history did not significantly differ between our two groups.

Table 5
Aspects which might be considered for the treatment choice during the shared decision-making between patient and physician

The diagnosis is key for the selection of the target for intervention and one of the important differential diagnosis of essential tremor is dystonic tremor. The boarder between these two conditions is not very well defined. Tremors in the setting of indisputable dystonia are usually treated with interventions in the Gpi based on the lesson from published data on tremor improvement in focal, segmental, and generalized dystonia. On the other hand, essential tremor patients need Vim surgery. There is still uncertainty about the target for patients with the presenting symptom of tremor who have soft signs for dystonia. While several reports have shown good results for such patients with Vim surgery, there are patients who have no or no sufficient improvement. There is no scientific solution to this problem and most centers target the Vim and the neighboring zona incerta for these cases. DBS has the advantage that one contact of the electrode can be placed in the gray substance of the Vim and another just below in the zona incerta of which the radiation prelemniscalis is part.

The final decision for or against a specific intervention depends on many factors which do not necessarily apply for all patients but should be discussed with the patient. Table 3 summarizes aspects which we usually cover during shared decision-making between patient and physician, and the information we offer is naturally not always based on proven evidence. Some aspects like availability, experience with the method, choice for bilateral treatment, and exclusion because of multimorbidity are more or less defined by the circumstances other factors are specific for one or several of these interventions. A detailed explanation of the surgical risks is important. For focused ultrasound, the complete shave of the head is concerning for some. Some patients cannot receive the treatment because their skull is too dense. Focused ultrasound is an invasive treatment, but given the relatively short-term procedure in the MRI, it can also be offered to elderly patients which otherwise would not qualify for surgical interventions. This applies in principle also for radiosurgery. Patients living remote from an experienced team sometimes prefer interventions which do not need regular follow-up visits. For most patients, the expert experience of the center is key.

### Deep representation learning of electronic health records to unlock patient stratification at scale [^116atGuu]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Parkinson's disease

Individuals diagnosed with PD divided into two groups (Fig. 4 b and Supplementary Table 5): one dominated by motor symptoms (1368 patients) and another (1684 patients) characterized by non-motor/independent features and longer course of disease.

Subgroup I is characterized as a tremor-dominant cohort (i.e. manifested by motor symptoms) because of the significant presence of diagnosis such as essential tremor, anxiety state, and dystonia. It is interesting to note that motor clinical features likely led to a common misdiagnosis of essential tremor, which is an action tremor that typically involves the hands. Parkinsonian tremor, on the contrary, although it can be present during postural maneuvers and action, is much more severe at rest and decreases with purposeful activities. However, when the tremor is severe, it is difficult to distinguish action tremor from resting tremor, leading to the aforementioned misdiagnosis. Moreover, anxiety states, emotional excitement, and stressful situations can exacerbate the tremor, and lead to a delayed PD diagnosis. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), usually nondiagnostic in PD, was ordered for several patients in this subgroup (13%), suggesting its use for differential diagnosis, for example, to investigate the presence of chronic/vascular encephalopathy.

Subgroup II included non-motor and independent symptoms, such as constipation and fatigue. Patients in subgroup II were significantly diagnosed with coronary artery disease that is prevalent in older patients (> 50 years old). Constipation and fatigue are among the most common non-motor problems related to autonomic dysfunction, diminished activity level, and slowed intestinal transit time in PD.

In their study about PD stratification with PPMI (Parkinson's progression markers initiative) data, Zhang et al.identified three distinct subgroups of patients based on severity of both motor and non-motor symptoms. In particular, one subgroup included patients with moderate functional decay in motor ability and stable cognitive ability; a second subgroup presented with mild functional decay in both motor and non-motor symptoms; and the third subgroup was characterized by rapid progression of both motor and non-motor symptoms. EHRs do not quantitatively capture PD symptom severity; therefore, our analyses cannot replicate these findings. However, unlike Zhang et al. we can discriminate between specific motor and non-motor symptoms and also suggest a longer, but not necessarily more severe, disease course for the non-motor symptom subgroup.

### The relationship between rest tremor and underlying lewy pathology in essential tremor: a clinical-pathological study of 201 cases [^113v7CW4]. Annals of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study methods have been reported in detail.ET cases were banked prospectively through the Essential Tremor Centralized Brain Repository (ETCBR), a centralized repository in the New York Brain Bank of brains from ET cases living in the United States (2003 – present). All cases signed informed consent approved by the University Ethics Boards at Columbia University, Yale University or University of Texas Southwestern — the sites of the 2 principal investigators (E.D.L. and P.L.F).

All ET diagnoses were carefully assigned using 3 sequential methods, as detailed. First, the vast majority (> 95%) were diagnosed clinically with ET by their treating physician. The remaining ET cases were self‐diagnosed and included cases who were healthcare workers and/or individuals with strong family histories of ET. Second, cases completed a series of semi‐structured clinical questionnaires, through which demographic, medical, and tremor‐specific data (eg, onset age, duration, family history) were collected. Each case then submitted 4 standardized hand‐drawn Archimedes spirals and additional clinical information from their medical records, treating physicians, and family members.ET diagnoses were confirmed by a senior neurologist specializing in movement disorders (E.D.L.) who used the following criteria: (1) moderate or greater amplitude arm tremor (rating ≥ 2) in at least 1 Archimedes spiral, (2) no history of PD or dystonia, and (3) no other etiology to explain tremor. Third, ET cases then underwent a standardized, videotaped neurological examination. The videotape protocol included assessments of postural tremor (including 2 positions with each arm), kinetic tremor (including 5 activities with each arm), and intention tremor of the arms, head, voice, and jaw tremorsand dystonia. Postural or kinetic tremor were rated by E.D.L. (0–3) on 12 items, resulting in a total tremor score (range = 0–36). Intention tremor was assessed during the finger‐nose‐finger maneuver (10 repetitions per arm) with ratings by E.D.L. including 0 (not present), 0.5 (possibly present), and 1 (definitely present) in each arm. The videotaped neurological examination also included the motor portion of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), including assessments of speech, facial expression, rest tremor (with arms in 3 positions: resting in the lap, relaxed at sides while standing, while walking), bradykinesia, posture, arising from a chair, and gait while walking and turning. Rest tremor was categorized by E.D.L. as present in 1, 2, or 3 positions. Furthermore, in 72 (80.0%) of 90 cases with rest tremor, the anatomic location (ie, phalangeal or metacarpophalangeal joint, wrist, elbow or shoulder) of rest tremor was coded in each arm in each position. Each videotaped neurological examination was reviewed (E.D.L.) and, based on the questionnaire and videotape data, the ET diagnosis ET was re‐examined in each case using published diagnostic criteria — moderate or greater amplitude kinetic tremor (tremor rating ≥ 2) during 3 or more activities or a head tremor in the absence of PD (as defined below) or other known causes. An important methodological feature is that none of the ET cases had PD at enrollment. There are several explanations for this. First, study advertisements specifically stipulated that individuals with both ET and PD should not apply for enrollment. Second, during an initial screening process, if a diagnosis of both ET and PD was self‐reported, that individual was not enrolled. Third, if after their videotaped neurological examination, both diagnoses of ET and PD were assigned, that person was not enrolled. Therefore, we only included individuals with ET and PD if they developed PD after enrollment (ie, during the follow‐up process).

### Treatment patterns in essential tremor: real-world evidence from a United Kingdom and France primary care database [^111VzszY]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Essential tremor (ET), primarily characterized by an uncontrolled rhythmic oscillation of agonist and antagonist muscle groups, is one of the most common neurological disorders. ET is characterized by isolated bilateral upper‐limb tremor, with or without tremor in other body locations such as the head, larynx, and lower limbs, with a variable frequency inversely related to age. Studies on ET prevalence have indicated marked heterogeneity in their estimates, largely due to variations in the investigated sample (such as age, sex, and ethnicity), case definition, and diagnostic approaches. However, if we limit the observation to the most recent meta‐analyses, estimated global prevalence ranges from 0.32% to 1.33%, showing a significant increase with advancing age, while mixed evidence exists on potential sex differences.

While traditionally regarded as a benign disorder, ET is actually recognized as a chronic, progressive disease. Generally, in the first phase of the disease, patients may experience mild symptoms characterized by rhythmic shaking, predominantly affecting the upper limb, that do not necessarily require treatment. However, over time, tremor progression may spread to other body segments to severely impair basic daily activities such as eating, writing, personal care, and driving. In this regard, a recent longitudinal study evaluated the temporal progression of ET severity and reported an annual worsening ranging between 3.1% and 12%.

Several factors may influence the decision to treat patients with ET, including the severity of symptoms, functional limitations, comorbidities, polytherapy, and patient preferences. However, available medications are few and the number has not grown much over the last decades. Furthermore, existing drugs for ET are suboptimal, as many patients do not respond to them, and even those who respond may not experience significant improvements in their daily life.

Among the available medications, propranolol and primidone, two front‐line interventions, led to symptom relief in up to 50% of treated patients, whereas other drugs such as gabapentin, benzodiazepines and topiramate showed lower efficacy. Non‐pharmacological treatments, such as thalamotomy and deep brain stimulation, have demonstrated high effectiveness in reducing limb tremor magnitude. However, these interventions are invasive procedures associated with significant risks of side effects; therefore, only 3% of patients with ET whose tremors are refractory to pharmacotherapy choose to undergo deep brain stimulation.

### Mirtazapine overdose is unlikely to cause major toxicity [^117Ej89n]. Clinical Toxicology (2014). Low credibility.

Our series does not support the suggestion that mirtazapine causes serotonin toxicity, based on a small number of case reports. Hernandez et al. describe agitation, confusion, gait disturbance, bilateral cogwheel rigidity and a temperature of 37.5°C in a 75-year-old male on 120 mg daily for 8 days of treatment. Ubogu and Katirji present a similar case in an 85-year-old female on mirtazapine monotherapy who developed cogwheeling, tremors, mutism with a normal temperature. These cases are not consistent with serotonin toxicity, and include extrapyramidal movements and non-specific effects that do not meet the criteria for serotonin toxicity. Serotonin toxicity only occurred in patients ingesting known serotonergic drugs, sertraline and citalopram, and did not occur in single-agent mirtazapine overdoses. Mirtazapine is an antagonist at the 5-HT 2A receptor and is unlikely to produce serotonin toxicity, which is most likely due to high levels of serotonin in the CNS acting at the 5-HT 2A receptor. There have been case reports suggesting mirtazapine causes significant CNS depression and that it has been associated with rhabdomyolysis. Kuliwaba discusses a 1800-mg mirtazapine overdose in a 40-year-old man, with known cognitive impairment. The patient slept for 10 h post-ingestion before presenting to hospital and had a peak CK of 9186 at 24 h. Khandat suggests an interaction between mirtazapine and lisinopril in an elderly 74-year-old male who presented with delirium and a CK of 43,000 IU/L, but was treated for a urinary tract infection. In all these cases there are other more likely causes for a reduced level of consciousness or CK elevation than mirtazapine toxicity. No patients in our series had an elevated CK, although this was not routinely tested. In patients ingesting mirtazapine alone the GCS never dropped below 10, and this degree of CNS depression would be unlikely to result in coma-induced rhabomyolysis. We found that a GCS of 10 or 11 was more likely in patients taking larger amounts, over 1000 mg (Fig. 2). And excluding the two patients with a GCS of 15 who ingested over 1000 mg, but presented > 15 h post ingestion, doses less than 1000 mg are unlikely to cause significant CNS depression.

### The treatment of tremor [^113ZaXY3]. Neurotherapeutics (2014). Low credibility.

Tremor is a hyperkinetic movement disorder characterized by rhythmic oscillations of one or more body parts. It can be disabling and may impair quality of life. Various etiological subtypes of tremor are recognized, with essential tremor (ET) and Parkinsonian tremor being the most common. Here we review the current literature on tremor treatment regarding ET and head and voice tremor, as well as dystonic tremor, orthostatic tremor, tremor due to multiple sclerosis (MS) or lesions in the brainstem or thalamus, neuropathic tremor, and functional (psychogenic) tremor, and summarize main findings. Most studies are available for ET and only few studies specifically focused on other tremor forms. Controlled trials outside ET are rare and hence most of the recommendations are based on a low level of evidence. For ET, propranolol and primidone are considered drugs of first choice with a mean effect size of approximately 50% tremor reduction. The efficacy of topiramate is also supported by a large double-blind placebo-controlled trial, while other drugs have less supporting evidence. With a mean effect size of about 90% deep brain stimulation in the nucleus ventralis intermedius or the subthalamic nucleus may be the most potent treatment; however, there are no controlled trials and it is reserved for severely affected patients. Dystonic limb tremor may respond to anticholinergics. Botulinum toxin improves head and voice tremor. Gabapentin and clonazepam are often recommended for orthostatic tremor. MS tremor responds only poorly to drug treatment. For patients with severe MS tremor, thalamic deep brain stimulation has been recommended. Patients with functional tremor may benefit from antidepressants and are best be treated in a multidisciplinary setting. Several tremor syndromes can already be treated with success. But new drugs specifically designed for tremor treatment are needed. ET is most likely covering different entities and their delineation may also improve treatment. Modern study designs and long-term studies are needed.

A possible indication is a late onset neurodegenerative disorder found among some male and female carriers of the premutation. This disorder is termed FXTAS and is characterized by intention tremor and cerebellar ataxia, as well as cognitive decline or impairment, peripheral neuropathy, Parkinsonism, and urinary and bowel incontinence. FXTAS is not only defined by clinical and molecular criteria but also by neuroradiological and neuropathological criteria. MRI findings show increased signals in the middle cerebellar peduncle and the deep white matter of the cerebellum.

### Essential tremor [^1111Cj8C]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2007). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Essential tremor is one of the most common movement disorders throughout the world, with prevalence in the general population of 0.4–3.9%. Although most people with essential tremor are only mildly affected, those who seek medical care are disabled to some extent, and most are socially handicapped by the tremor.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of drug treatments in people with essential tremor of the hand? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to December 2006 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 41 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: adding mirtazepine to other antitremor drugs; benzodiazepines; beta-blockers other than propranolol; botulinum A toxin-haemagglutinin complex; calcium channel blockers; carbonic anhydrase inhibitors; clonidine; flunarizine; gabapentin; isoniazid; Phenobarbital; primidone; propranolol; and topiramate.

### Treatment of patients with essential tremor [^114h3ire]. The Lancet: Neurology (2011). Medium credibility.

Essential tremor is a common movement disorder. Tremor severity and handicap vary widely, but most patients with essential tremor do not receive a diagnosis and hence are never treated. Furthermore, many patients abandon treatment because of side-effects or poor efficacy. A newly developed algorithm, based on the logarithmic relation between tremor amplitude and clinical tremor ratings, can be used to compare the magnitude of effect of available treatments. Drugs with established efficacy (propranolol and primidone) produce a mean tremor reduction of about 50%. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) in the thalamic nucleus ventrointermedius or neighbouring subthalamic structures reduces tremor by about 90%. However, no controlled trials of DBS have been done, and the best target is still uncertain. Better drugs are needed, and controlled trials are required to determine the safety and efficacy of DBS in the nucleus ventrointermedius and neighbouring subthalamic structures.

### Managing essential tremor [^111Mrv2T]. Neurotherapeutics (2020). Medium credibility.

While the lack of a unified rating scale for tremors is a deficiency for all current rating, the reporting is further limited by inconsistent use of individualized subscores of the two main scales as outcome parameters in some studies. The different parts of the TRS (A, tremor exam; B, performance tests; C, daily activities) or the TETRAS (performance, tremor exam) are understandably separate outcomes, but sometimes outcomes for the upper extremities by combining items from the subscales or variable customized lateralized scores (e.g. combining physician rated tremor severity with performance tests) contralateral to the intervention are used. Others use single items like writing or just the postural tremor of the contralateral hand. There are even trials with outcomes differing between the original report and the long-term follow-up study. While such scores are needed to understand the value of the different interventions, unification of these outcomes will be needed to compare the results similar to other diseases like Parkinson's disease or other better standardized fields of neurology. For the present evaluation, it adds to the heterogeneity of the results, despite the overall message remains robust. Our analysis has used lateralized scores, lateralized single items for action or postural tremor synonymously and separated from total scores if available.

### Longitudinal study of clinical and neurophysiological features in essential tremor [^114BJZsJ]. European Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Essential tremor (ET) is a common movement disorder characterized by bilateral upper limb postural and/or kinetic tremor with at least 3‐year duration, with or without tremor in other body segments. In addition to action tremor, other motor features, non‐motor manifestations including cognitive and psychiatric disorders, as well as the so‐called soft signs (i.e. neurological signs of uncertain significance) are frequently observed in ET. The relation between ET‐plus and ET progression is an under‐investigated issue. In the most recent consensus statement, the concept of ET‐plus was introduced to classify ET cases that have additional neurological signs of uncertain significance and relation to tremor that are not sufficient to make alternative diagnoses. However, the concept of ET‐plus is controversial. According to some authors, ET‐plus could merely be an advanced stage of ET rather than a distinct condition with distinct pathophysiological mechanisms, and the relation between soft signs and ET progression is unclear. To date, only one longitudinal study has specifically investigated ET‐plus progression. Further clarifying the occurrence of soft signs in ET progression may provide a better understanding of the ET‐plus concept.

The progression of ET manifestations is still a critical and underinvestigated issue. To date, only a few clinical longitudinal studies have characterized the progression of motor features in ET. Some studies estimated an annual tremor severity worsening of between 3.1% and 12%, with tremor spread to cranial structures. Increased tremor severity over time may also depend on the higher prevalence of rest tremor observed in advanced disease stages. The progression of non‐motor symptoms in ET is even less understood. Regarding demographic and clinical factors possibly influencing ET progression, it has been shown that female patients have a higher risk of manifesting or developing head and voice tremor over time. The contribution of other factors, including age at tremor onset, family history, or specific tremor characteristics at baseline, to disease progression has been poorly addressed. Moreover, although some evidence showed a reduction in postural tremor frequency over time, no previous neurophysiological study has comprehensively assessed whether tremor features in ET, including tremor distribution and activation conditions, change during the disease course.

Prevalence of neurodegenerative symptoms among premutation carriers is quantified as "46% of males and as many as 17% of females… after age 50", with the note that "some individuals may experience neurological symptoms that do not meet full clinical criteria for the diagnosis of FXTAS".

Propranolol

Among the drugs of first choice for ET is propranolol, a nonselective β-adrenergic receptor antagonist. The effect is likely exerted on central β2 receptors but peripheral effects on the muscle spindle are also present. As propranolol also has major cardiovascular effects, an electrocardiogram should be carried out before starting the treatment. Propranolol is contradicted in cases of severe bradycardia or second- and third-degree AV block. Generally, propranolol is well tolerated at lower dosages but side effects include hypotension, fatigue, depression, and erectile dysfunction. It is contraindicated for patients with asthma and should be used with caution in diabetes patients because of its masking effect on hypoglycemia. Daily doses of 30–320 mg (mostly 60–240 mg) are recommended (Table 4). Low daily dosages (30–60 mg) can be tried for small amplitude tremors. Intermittent treatment in stress situation is used by some patients. Some artists regularly use this to improve their performance. Short-term improvements are in the order of 30–75% (average 44%) and mainly based on accelerometric measurements (Fig. 1). Long-term experience is limited and based on uncontrolled case series. One-third of the patients or more had no benefit, chronic side effects were found in 17%, and 17% developed tolerance to propranolol. As a rule of thumb, half of the patients have a long-term benefit from propranolol and have a 50% reduction of tremor severity. There are no known predictors for a positive response. It is approved for tremor treatment in most countries.

### Dopamine transporter SPECT: how to remove subjectivity? [^113oES2G]. Movement Disorders (2009). Low credibility.

Clinical criteria enable accurate and reliable diagnosis of parkinsonian syndromes when cardinal clinical features are fully developed. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) investigating the striatal dopamine transporter (DAT) status have been suggested to increase the diagnostic accuracy in uncertain parkinsonian syndromes such as isolated tremor symptoms not fulfilling essential tremor criteria, as well as drug-induced, vascular and psychogenetic parkinsonism. Several approaches for the analysis of the striatal DAT distribution have been tested for their ability to analyze and quantify SPECT images. Visual assessment of DAT binding and semiquantitative analysis using region of interests have been recommended by Nuclear Medicine Associations to be incorporated in the routine work-up of DAT-SPECT. Besides these observer dependent approaches, fully automated image-analysis techniques have been validated in the clinical setting. Their potential as tools to improve the diagnostic accuracy in patients presenting with parkinsonian features is reviewed here.

### Moving toward "laboratory-supported" criteria for psychogenic tremor [^114LkRKd]. Movement Disorders (2011). Low credibility.

Psychogenic tremor (PsyT) is the most commonly reported psychogenic movement disorder (PMD). Current diagnostic criteria for PMDare based, at least in part, on clinical findings that are incongruent with organic movement disorders; with regard to tremor, these include distractibility and entrainment. However, there is no gold standard for diagnosing PsyT apart from these clinical criteria. In some patients, uncertainty remains and may result in diagnostic delay and unnecessary investigation and treatment. The importance of a positive diagnosis, rather than one of exclusion, has been repeatedly emphasized, and in line with this, it has been suggested that a "laboratory-supported" level of certainty might be added to current clinical diagnostic criteria.

A variety of electrophysiological tests have been proposed as useful in distinguishing PsyT from organic tremor (OrgT), and might therefore qualify for inclusion in this new level of diagnostic certainty. Previously reported characteristics of PsyT include a tonic discharge of antagonist muscles approximately 300ms before the onset of tremor bursts, an increase of tremor amplitudes in response to weighting the limb, entrainment or an increase in variability and change of tremor frequency while tapping with the contralateral hand,–less accurate tapping performance at requested frequencies, significant coherence in bilateral tremors, and transient arrest of tremor during a ballistic movement of the other hand.

Current data, using such tests to distinguish between PsyT and OrgT, have two important limitations. First, there has been no direct head-to-head comparison of the utility of these techniques in the same sample of patients. Second, and perhaps more important, most tests have only been compared between PsyT and essential tremor (ET) or PD tremor, rather than more unusual OrgT disorders, such as dystonic tremor (DT), where differentiation from PsyT may be more difficult.

In this study, we, therefore, set out to directly compare the sensitivity and specificity of these electrophysiological techniques in a group of patients with different tremor disorders. We consider this study a first step toward the development of laboratory-supported criteria for PsyT.

### Medications used to treat tremors [^1138NkLR]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2022). Medium credibility.

Tremor is one of the most common movement disorders, though it can arise in the context of several unrelated neurological disorders whose pharmacology and anatomical origins differ greatly. Treatment of tremors can take advantage of several medications and neurosurgical treatments. Medications useful for treating tremor are discussed in this review, including those for action tremor as seen in essential tremor, the resting tremor of Parkinson's disease, orthostatic tremor, cerebellar tremor, Holmes tremor, dystonic tremor, and drug-induced tremors. A medication that is useful for most types of tremors is the beta-blocker propranolol, though even in essential tremor it can fail to be effective at tremor control. This article is part of the Special Issue "Tremor" edited by Daniel D. Truong, Mark Hallett, and Aasef Shaikh.

Fig. 2
Surgical interventions for essential tremor. The four options are shown with the grading of usefulness of the Movement Disorder Society. The bars show the mean improvement in percent for the different interventions reported in the studies mentioned in the text. The lateralized TRS is summarizing tremor severity items only on the side contralateral to the intervention. The total TRS covers tremor severity, performance tests, and activities of daily living. The dotted line is the average improvement of the lateralized score exerted by medications (see Fig. 2). The grading of clinical usefulness does not reflect the strength of the effect size of the intervention but the strength of published evidence.

Long-term effects are controversial and only poorly documented but it is likely that for ET, there long-term efficacy is similar as for the other better studied procedures.

### New horizons in late-onset essential tremor: a pre-cognitive biomarker of dementia? [^113eESx7]. Age and Ageing (2022). Medium credibility.

There are currently no routinely available laboratory-supported tests to help with the diagnosis of ET but clinicians with access to neurophysiology assessments sometimes use EMG to objectively quantify tremor frequency as supportive evidence, and to exclude features of dystonia. In one study, for example, EMG recordings could differentiate between parkinsonian tremor and ET with 93% accuracy and mean tremor frequency was a key discriminatory feature.

A variety of clinical scales have been devised to help quantify ET, including The Essential Tremor Rating Assessment Scales (TETRAS), the Fahn-Tolosa-Marin (FTM) scale and the Bain and Findley clinical tremor rating scale. However, their use tends to be limited to research settings, and they are only used clinically when 'proof' of effect is required, such as a DBS outcome measure. Most scales take about 10–20 min and clinicians are required to rate severity of tremor on a scale of 0–4 (TETRAS and FTM) or 0–10 (Bain and Findley) for different body parts including voice, neck, face, upper and lower limbs. As all scales rely on the subjective judgement of a clinician, there is a degree of intra- and inter-rater variability. In one study of 59 physicians and trained medical personnel, the intra-rater and inter-rater reliability of the FTM scale was 0.54 (i.e. moderate agreement) and 0.10–0.24 (i.e. none to minimal agreement) respectively.

### Tremor: sorting through the differential diagnosis… [^115qs2yP]. AAFP (2018). Low credibility.

1–3 Aside from careful clinical examination and imaging when needed, there is no standard test to distinguish between common types of tremor, which can make the evaluation challenging. However, establishing the underlying cause is important because prognosis and specific treatment plans vary considerably. The most common tremors in patients presenting to primary care physicians are enhanced physiologic tremor, essential tremor, and parkinsonian tremor. 1, 3–6 All tremors are more common in older age.
7. 3, 10, 11 Most tremors are action tremors, which occur with voluntary muscle contraction. Action tremors are subdivided into postural, isometric, and kinetic tremors. 8, 10 A postural tremor is present while maintaining a position against gravity. An isometric tremor occurs with muscle contraction against a rigid stationary object.

A kinetic tremor is associated with voluntary movement and includes intention tremor, which is produced with target-directed movement.
2. 3, 12 One study found that 95% of patients with essential tremor had primarily kinetic, rather than postural, characteristics. 12 Essential tremor is most obvious in the wrists and hands when patients hold their arms in front of them; however, it can also affect the head, lower extremities, and voice. 13 It is generally bilateral, is present with different tasks, and interferes with activities of daily living. 1, 5. Approximately 70% of patients with Parkinson disease have resting tremor as the presenting feature. 1, 11 The classic parkinsonian tremor begins as a low-frequency, pill-rolling motion of the fingers, progressing to forearm pronation/supination and elbow flexion/extension. It is typically unilateral, occurs at rest, and fades with voluntary movement.

It can reemerge after latency with maintenance of posture, which can create diagnostic confusion. Tremor can involve the leg and jaw as well. 3, 9 A video example of this tremor is available. DYSTONIC TREMOR Dystonic tremor is rare, appearing in 0. 03% of the population. It typically occurs in patients younger than 50 years. The tremor is usually irregular and jerky, and certain hand or arm positions extinguish the tremor. Other signs of dystonia are always present. 8, 21.
