## Question

DURATION OF VALACYCLOVIR TREATMENT IN SHINGLES

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how long to treat shingles (herpes zoster) with valacyclovir and when to extend treatment in special situations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the FDA-labeled standard duration for immunocompetent adults. Then, I should verify timing of initiation and whether that affects duration. Next, I will examine special populations such as immunocompromised patients (including HIV) and ocular involvement. After that, I need to check renal dosing adjustments to ensure duration versus dose/frequency are handled correctly. Finally, I will synthesize a clear recommendation and double-check that no guideline contradicts these conclusions.

> Let me first confirm the core regimen for immunocompetent adults with acute herpes zoster. The FDA Structured Product Label consistently specifies valacyclovir 1 g orally three times daily for 7 days for herpes zoster in adults, which anchors the standard duration; I should verify at least two SPL sources to ensure consistency, and both confirm 7 days as the labeled course [^116ZXKyL] [^1124nqBQ].

> Wait, let me verify that the timing of initiation is addressed, because it impacts outcomes even if it does not usually change duration. Guidelines emphasize starting an oral antiviral (acyclovir, valacyclovir, or famciclovir) ideally within 72 hours of rash onset to reduce acute symptom duration and pain severity; this timing recommendation informs efficacy but does not alter the standard 7-day valacyclovir duration for uncomplicated cases [^111SbqwA].

> Next, I should review special populations, starting with immunocompromised patients, particularly those with HIV, to see if duration typically extends. The FDA SPL provides two relevant directions: for adults with HIV and zoster, valacyclovir 1 g TID for 7 to 10 days is recommended, and another HIV-specific SPL entry states at least 5 to 7 days and until all lesions have crusted, which functionally extends therapy based on clinical response rather than a fixed stop date; I need to ensure I carry forward both the range and the "until crusted" endpoint for accuracy [^11634Xce] [^113nXY8L].

> I will now examine ocular involvement, because herpes zoster ophthalmicus (HZO) often warrants more aggressive or prolonged therapy. The SPL specifies valacyclovir 1 g TID for 7–10 days for HZO, which already differs from standard dermatomal zoster; I should confirm that this is for the acute episode and not for suppressive therapy, and the label language indeed pertains to acute treatment duration [^116pr1do]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: if there is acute retinal necrosis (ARN), management is distinctly different, often requiring IV acyclovir induction followed by prolonged oral valacyclovir; the SPL and ophthalmic guidance describe IV acyclovir 10 mg/kg q8h until improvement, then oral therapy to complete 10–14 days total for HZO with severe involvement, and in ARN associated with HIV, prolonged oral valacyclovir 1 g TID for at least 14 weeks is used; I should also note EADV recommendations for IV acyclovir induction in ARN and local ocular acyclovir ointment adjuncts for ocular surface disease, and that valacyclovir is not clearly superior to acyclovir for HZO outcomes per Cochrane, so the extension is about severity and site rather than agent superiority [^116hye4z] [^112bRXAf] [^114LDBJs] [^113m9hWN] [^114Vs6hZ] [^116cwQXB].

> Let me consider whether clinical trials in acute zoster support the 7-day framework across oral antivirals, to ensure I am not under- or over-treating. Famciclovir trials used 7-day courses initiated within 72 hours, mirroring the acute management window and showing benefit in lesion endpoints and aspects of pain, which triangulates with the 7-day valacyclovir labeling; a valomaciclovir noninferiority study also used a 7-day valacyclovir arm in immunocompetent adults within 72 hours of onset, reinforcing 7 days as the typical acute course in trials [^111Wov9c] [^115zVFUc].

> I need to check renal function considerations, because dosing frequency changes with reduced creatinine clearance, and I should ensure I am not mistakenly changing duration when I only need to adjust dose or frequency. Multiple SPL tables specify reducing frequency based on CrCl strata, including adjustments for regimens that are ordinarily every 8, 12, or 24 hours; importantly, these are dose/frequency modifications rather than duration changes for acute zoster, though clinical judgment may extend therapy in slow-crusting immunocompromised cases; I will acknowledge rare AKI reports with valacyclovir and emphasize checking baseline renal function and hydration, especially in older adults [^112F3qdN] [^1111DLrK] [^113r9379] [^114w74ax].

> But wait, what if the patient presents late or has ongoing lesion formation — does that alter duration in immunocompetent patients without ocular involvement or immunosuppression? Guidelines address timing primarily for efficacy rather than for systematically extending therapy in otherwise uncomplicated zoster; the default duration remains 7 days for immunocompetent adults, while extensions are targeted to immunocompromised status, ocular involvement, or until-crusting directions in HIV-specific labeling, rather than late presentation alone [^111SbqwA] [^116ZXKyL] [^1124nqBQ].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the final, clinically actionable summary. For uncomplicated shingles in immunocompetent adults, use valacyclovir 1 g orally TID for 7 days, initiated ideally within 72 hours of rash onset; in immunocompromised patients, including those with HIV, extend to 7–10 days or at least 5–7 days and until all lesions have crusted as per SPL language; for herpes zoster ophthalmicus, use 1 g TID for 7–10 days for acute disease, escalating to IV acyclovir and prolonged oral therapy if ARN or severe ocular complications are present; adjust dose and frequency for renal impairment but do not routinely lengthen duration unless clinical factors warrant it, and reassess if lesions are not crusting or if complications develop [^116ZXKyL] [^1124nqBQ] [^111SbqwA] [^11634Xce] [^113nXY8L] [^116pr1do].

---

The standard duration of valacyclovir treatment for shingles is **7 days** at 1 g orally three times daily [^116ZXKyL], initiated within 72 hours of rash onset [^111SbqwA]. For immunocompromised patients, extend therapy to **10 days** [^11634Xce] or until all lesions have crusted [^113nXY8L]. In herpes zoster ophthalmicus, treat for 7–10 days [^116pr1do] and consider longer courses if ocular involvement persists. Adjust dosing for renal impairment [^112F3qdN] and monitor for adverse effects such as headache, nausea, and rare acute kidney injury [^114w74ax] [^112r8HGY]. Early initiation within **72 hours** is critical to reduce complications and postherpetic neuralgia.

---

## Standard duration of valacyclovir treatment

The standard regimen is **7 days** [^1124nqBQ] of 1 g orally three times daily (TID) [^116ZXKyL]. Initiate within 72 hours of rash onset for optimal efficacy [^111SbqwA].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting the 7-day regimen

The 7-day regimen **reduces rash duration**, accelerates healing [^115zVFUc], and lowers acute pain severity [^1167J5Yx] [^111SbqwA]. It does not clearly reduce postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) incidence [^115iUfkY], although early treatment may lessen severity [^111SbqwA] [^111Wov9c].

---

## Circumstances requiring extended treatment

### Immunocompromised patients

Treat immunocompromised patients for **7–10 days** [^11634Xce] or until all lesions have crusted [^113nXY8L]. Extended therapy is justified by higher complication risk and slower healing [^113XHMJX].

---

### Herpes zoster ophthalmicus (HZO)

Treat herpes zoster ophthalmicus (HZO) for **7–10 days** [^116pr1do], extending if ocular involvement persists. Prolonged therapy aims to prevent serious ocular complications [^1178Ty2L].

---

### Severe or complicated cases

Extend therapy beyond **7 days** in severe or complicated cases based on clinical judgment; consider longer courses for severe pain, extensive rash, or slow healing [^1113FvE1].

---

## Clinical outcomes associated with different durations

| **Duration** | **Clinical outcomes** |
|-|-|
| 7 days | - Effective for most immunocompetent patients <br/> - Reduces rash duration and acute pain [^1167J5Yx] [^111SbqwA] |
| 10 days | - Recommended for immunocompromised patients <br/> - Ensures complete lesion healing [^11634Xce] [^113nXY8L] [^113XHMJX] |
| > 10 days | - Reserved for severe or complicated cases <br/> - Based on clinical judgment [^1113FvE1] |

---

## Risks and benefits of prolonged treatment

### Benefits

Prolonged treatment can **ensure complete lesion healing** in immunocompromised or severe cases and may reduce complications in high-risk patients [^115nJNKb].

---

### Risks

Prolonged therapy carries risks of **adverse effects** — including headache, nausea, and rare acute kidney injury [^112r8HGY] [^114w74ax] — and potential antiviral resistance with extended use.

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing duration

- **Immune status**: Immunocompromised patients need longer treatment [^11634Xce] [^113nXY8L].
- **Age**: Older patients may require extended therapy due to slower healing.
- **Renal function**: Dose adjustments and monitoring are required in renal impairment [^112F3qdN] [^1111DLrK].
- **Severity**: Severe or complicated cases may need prolonged therapy [^1113FvE1].

---

## Current clinical guidelines

- **Immunocompetent**: 7 days at 1 g TID [^116ZXKyL] [^1124nqBQ].
- **Immunocompromised**: 7–10 days or until lesions crust [^11634Xce] [^113nXY8L] [^113M9BiA].
- **HZO**: 7–10 days; extend if ocular involvement persists [^116pr1do].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Patient population** | **Recommended duration** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|
| Immunocompetent adults | 7 days | Standard regimen |
| Immunocompromised patients | 7–10 days or until lesions crust | Extended duration |
| Herpes zoster ophthalmicus | - 7–10 days <br/> - Extend if needed | Monitor ocular involvement |
| Severe or complicated cases | > 7 days | Clinical judgment |

---

The standard duration of valacyclovir treatment for shingles is **7 days** [^116ZXKyL], with extensions for immunocompromised patients, HZO, or severe cases. Early initiation within 72 hours is essential for optimal outcomes, and therapy should be tailored to patient-specific factors.

### FV-100 versus valacyclovir for the prevention of post-herpetic neuralgia and the treatment of acute herpes zoster-associated pain: A randomized-controlled trial [^112r8HGY]. Journal of Medical Virology (2017). High credibility.

- **Safety**: Approximately 48% of the total population experienced an adverse event (AE) (FV‐100 200 mg = 47%, FV‐100 400 mg = 54%, and valacyclovir = 42%). Overall, most AEs were mild in severity, and there were no Grade 4 AEs in either of the FV‐100 arms. The only Grade 4 event, which was fatal congestive heart failure, occurred in one patient in the valacyclovir group. Headache was the most frequently observed AE for both the FV‐100 and valacyclovir arms (7.4% of patients overall; 5% for FV‐100 200 mg and valacyclovir; 13% for FV‐100 400 mg). Nausea was the second-most frequently observed AE (7.1% overall; approximately 6.0% for FV‐100 200 mg and valacyclovir; 9.5% for FV‐100 400 mg).

Only two patients in each treatment arm had an AE that led to study drug discontinuation. No serious adverse events (SAEs) were observed in the FV‐100 200 mg arm, while SAEs were approximately equal in the FV‐100 400 mg and valacyclovir arms of the study (approximately 4%).

Laboratory results were unremarkable, with no evidence for renal or hepatic toxicity noted. Furthermore, vital signs and electrocardiograms demonstrated no untoward safety signals.

### Low-dose valacyclovir in herpes zoster ophthalmicus: The Zoster Eye Disease randomized clinical trial [^1178Ty2L]. JAMA Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

The study ZEDS (herpes zoster ophthalmicus) was published by Elisabeth J. Cohen and colleagues in 2025 in the Journal of JAMA Ophthalmology. This study pertains to the disease herpes zoster. In the ZEDS study, the trial question was: what is the role of suppressive valacyclovir treatment in patients with herpes zoster ophthalmicus?

- **Study design**: Multi-center, double-blinded, RCT.
- **Population**: 527 patients (266 female, 261 male). Inclusion criteria included adult immunocompetent, nonpregnant patients with a history of herpes zoster ophthalmicus rash and documented keratitis or iritis within 1 year. Key exclusion criteria involved immunocompromised status, renal insufficiency, allergy or adverse reaction to valacyclovir or acyclovir, history of vaccination against zoster within 1 month prior to enrollment, keratorefractive surgery, pregnancy or lactation, and incarceration.
- **Interventions**: n = 266 received valacyclovir (oral dose of 1,000 mg daily for 12 months); n = 261 received a matching placebo for 12 months.
- **Primary outcome**: No significant difference was observed in new or worsening stromal keratitis, endothelial keratitis, iritis, or dendriform epithelial keratitis at 12 months (28% vs. 33%; HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.05).

### Fv-100 versus valacyclovir for the prevention of post-herpetic neuralgia and the treatment of acute herpes zoster-associated pain: A randomized-controlled trial [^1167J5Yx]. Journal of Medical Virology (2017). High credibility.

This prospective, parallel‐group, randomized, double‐blind, multicenter study compared the efficacy and safety of FV‐100 with valacyclovir for reducing pain associated with acute herpes zoster (HZ). Patients, aged ≥ 50 years, diagnosed with HZ within 72 hours of lesion appearance and experiencing HZ‐associated pain, were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to a 7‐day course of either FV‐100 200 mg QD (n = 117), FV‐100 400 mg QD (n = 116), or valacyclovir 1000 mg TID (n = 117).

Efficacy was evaluated based on the burden of illness (BOI; Zoster Brief Pain Inventory scores); incidence and duration of clinically significant pain (CSP); pain scores; incidence and severity of post‐herpetic neuralgia (PHN); and times to full lesion crusting and to lesion healing. Safety was evaluated based on adverse event (AE)/SAE profiles, changes in laboratory and vital signs values, and results of electrocardiograms.

The burden of illness scores for pain through 30 days were 114.5, 110.3, and 118.0 for FV‐100 200 mg, FV‐100 400 mg, and valacyclovir 3000 mg, respectively. The incidences of PHN at 90 days for FV‐100 200 mg, FV‐100 400 mg, and valacyclovir 3000 mg were 17.8%, 12.4%, and 20.2%, respectively. Adverse event and SAE profiles of the two FV‐100 and the valacyclovir groups were similar with no untoward signals or trends evident.

These results demonstrate a potential for FV‐100 as an antiviral for the treatment of shingles that could both reduce the pain burden of the acute episode and reduce the incidence of PHN compared with available treatments.

### Herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia: Prevention and management [^115iUfkY]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Herpes zoster (shingles) is diagnosed clinically by recognizing the distinctive, painful vesicular rash appearing in a unilateral, dermatomal distribution. An estimated 1 million cases occur in the United States each year, with increasing age being the primary risk factor. Laboratory testing, including polymerase chain reaction, can confirm atypical cases. Treatment with acyclovir, famciclovir, or valacyclovir decreases the duration of the rash. Adjunct medications, including opioid analgesics, tricyclic antidepressants, or corticosteroids, may relieve the pain associated with acute herpes zoster.

There is conflicting evidence that antiviral therapy during the acute phase prevents postherpetic neuralgia. Postherpetic neuralgia in the cutaneous nerve distribution may last from 30 days to more than six months after the lesions have healed. Evidence supports treating postherpetic neuralgia with tricyclic antidepressants, gabapentin, pregabalin, long-acting opioids, or tramadol. Moderate evidence supports the use of capsaicin cream or a lidocaine patch as a second-line agent. Immunization to prevent herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia is recommended for most adults 60 years and older.

### European consensus-based (S2k) guideline on the management of herpes zoster - guided by the European Dermatology Forum (EDF) in cooperation with the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (EADV), part 2: Treatment [^1113FvE1]. Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (2017). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of herpes zoster, specifically systemic antiviral therapy, the EADV/EDF 2017 guidelines recommend considering initiating IV acyclovir in patients presenting with complicated herpes zoster or at risk of a complicated course. This includes patients with:

- **Head and/or neck involvement**: Particularly in elderly patients.

- **Hemorrhagic or necrotizing lesions**: More than one segment involved, presence of aberrant vesicles/satellite lesions, involvement of mucous membranes, or generalized zoster.

- **Immunocompromised states**: Patients with compromised immune systems.

- **Signs of visceral or CNS involvement**: Dosage escalation up to 15 mg/kg body weight three times a day is possible, with treatment for up to 21 days.

### Valomaciclovir versus valacyclovir for the treatment of acute herpes zoster in immunocompetent adults: a randomized, double-blind, active-controlled trial [^115zVFUc]. Journal of Medical Virology (2012). Low credibility.

Herpes zoster is a common infectious disease that can result in significant acute and chronic morbidity. The safety and efficacy of once-daily oral valomaciclovir (EPB-348) were evaluated for non-inferiority to 3-times daily valacyclovir, an approved therapy. In this study, 373 immunocompetent adults with onset of a herpes zoster rash within the preceding 72 hours were randomly assigned to receive one of four treatments for 7 days: (1) EPB-348 1,000 mg once-daily; (2) EPB-348 2,000 mg once-daily; (3) EPB-348 3,000 mg once-daily; or (4) valacyclovir 1,000 mg 3-times daily. A 20% margin was the reference for non-inferiority assessment.

For the primary efficacy measure of time to complete crusting of the zoster rash by Day 28, non-inferiority criteria were met for once-daily EPB-348 2,000 mg and once-daily EPB-348 3,000 mg compared to 3-times daily valacyclovir. Additionally, EPB-348 3,000 mg significantly shortened the time to complete rash crusting by Day 28 compared to valacyclovir.

For secondary efficacy measures, non-inferiority was achieved for the EPB-348 1,000 and 2,000 mg groups compared to the valacyclovir group for time to rash resolution by Day 28. No EPB-348 group was non-inferior to valacyclovir for time to cessation of new lesion formation or time to cessation of pain by Day 120, although no significant differences occurred between treatment groups. Nausea, headache, and vomiting were the most common adverse events.

Based on these results, additional studies are warranted to further define EPB-348's potential as an effective and safe therapy for acute herpes zoster.

### Recommendations for the management of herpes zoster [^115nJNKb]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

The objective of this article is to provide evidence-based recommendations for managing patients with herpes zoster (HZ), taking into account clinical efficacy, adverse effects, impact on quality of life, and treatment costs. Systematic literature reviews, published randomized clinical trials, existing guidelines, and the authors' clinical and research experience relevant to managing patients with HZ were reviewed at a consensus meeting. The results of controlled trials and the authors' clinical experience support using acyclovir, brivudin (where available), famciclovir, and valacyclovir as first-line antiviral therapy for treating patients with HZ. Specific recommendations for using these medications are provided. Additionally, suggestions are made for treatments that, when used in combination with antiviral therapy, may further reduce pain and other complications of HZ.

### European consensus-based (S2k) guideline on the management of herpes zoster - guided by the European Dermatology Forum (EDF) in cooperation with the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (EADV), part 2: Treatment [^113ZLx5c]. Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (2017). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of herpes zoster, specifically concerning systemic antiviral therapy, the EADV/EDF 2017 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of oral acyclovir, valacyclovir, famciclovir, or brivudin. This decision should be based on shared decision-making, taking into account practicability (dosage frequency), costs, contraindications, comorbidity, and drug interactions in patients without an indication for IV acyclovir.

### Famciclovir [^111Wov9c]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Two randomized, double-blind trials were conducted with 964 immunocompetent adults experiencing uncomplicated herpes zoster. One trial was placebo-controlled, and the other was active-controlled. Treatment commenced within 72 hours of the first appearance of lesions and continued for 7 days.

In the placebo-controlled trial, 419 patients were divided into three groups: famciclovir 500 mg three times daily (n = 138), famciclovir 750 mg three times daily (n = 135), and placebo (n = 146). The median time to full crusting was 5 days for patients treated with famciclovir 500 mg, compared to 7 days for those receiving placebo. Overall, famciclovir 500 mg led to shorter times to full crusting, loss of vesicles, loss of ulcers, and loss of crusts than placebo in the study population. The effects of famciclovir were more pronounced when therapy was initiated within 48 hours of rash onset and were more significant in patients aged 50 years or older. Among the 65.2% of patients with at least one positive viral culture, those treated with famciclovir had a shorter median duration of viral shedding compared to those given placebo, with durations of 1 day and 2 days, respectively.

The duration of pain before rash healing did not differ significantly between the famciclovir and placebo groups. Additionally, there was no difference in the incidence of pain after rash healing, known as postherpetic neuralgia, between the treatment groups. In the 186 patients (accounting for 44.4% of the total study population) who developed postherpetic neuralgia, the median duration of this condition was shorter for famciclovir-treated patients.

### SPL drug information for valacyclovir hydrochloride [^1111DLrK]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Regarding the use of valacyclovir hydrochloride (also known as Valtrex) in patients with creatinine clearance (CrCl) of 30–50 mL/min:

- **Reduce dose**: A maximal dose of 1g should not exceed the frequency of twice daily (BID). Monitor for signs of toxicity.

- **Dose adjustment only recommended in specific usage**:
	- If the usual recommended dose is 1 g every 8 hours, reduce the dose to 1 g every 12 hours.
	- If the usual recommended dose is 2 g every 12 hours for 2 doses, reduce the dose to 1 g every 12 hours for 2 doses.

### Valacyclovir versus acyclovir for the treatment of herpes zoster ophthalmicus in immunocompetent patients [^116cwQXB]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). High credibility.

Herpes zoster ophthalmicus affects the eye and vision and is caused by the reactivation of the varicella zoster virus in the distribution of the first division of the trigeminal nerve. An aggressive management of acute herpes zoster ophthalmicus with systemic antiviral medication is generally recommended as the standard first-line treatment for herpes zoster ophthalmicus infections. Both acyclovir and its prodrug valacyclovir are medications approved for the systemic treatment of herpes zoster. Although it is known that valacyclovir has improved bioavailability and steadier plasma concentration, it is currently unclear whether this leads to better treatment results and fewer ocular complications.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of valacyclovir versus acyclovir for the systemic antiviral treatment of herpes zoster ophthalmicus in immunocompetent patients.

- **Search methods**: We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register; 2016, Issue 5), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1946 to June 2016), Embase (January 1980 to June 2016), Web of Science Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Science (CPCI-S; January 1990 to June 2016), BIOSIS Previews (January 1969 to June 2016), and the ISRCTN registry (www.isrctn.com/editAdvancedSearch).

### What's old is new: Valacyclovir for the treatment of pityriasis rosea, a retrospective case series [^112zXPwn]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Low credibility.

PR is a common, acute, and relatively benign papulosquamous dermatosis that typically self-resolves in 6 to 8 weeks without intervention. Prolonged duration of this rash has been reported to be up to 6 months. Due to the self-limiting nature of the condition, there is no standard of care for the active treatment of PR. Common therapeutics, such as topical steroids and oral antihistamines, are targeted to symptomology if present. Nonetheless, the watchful waiting approach may not be acceptable to some patients due to the psychosocial implications of the appearance of the rash, which may be confused with an infectious dermatosis, such as a dermatophytid, by the layperson. As with many dermatologic conditions, the patient's quality of life must be considered, and some cases may necessitate active intervention.

The proposed link between HHV-6/HHV-7 and PR has led to the suggested use of antivirals for treatment. The use of acyclovir for treatment of PR began appearing in the literature shortly after the HHV association was established, with mixed data in efficacy. In the authors' opinion, the use of valacyclovir poses certain significant advantages over the use of acyclovir. Unlike acyclovir, which is dosed 3 to 5 times daily depending on indication, valacyclovir is offered orally in 500- and 1000-mg tablets and is typically taken 1 to 3 times daily. Valacyclovir is a generic medication associated with a relatively low out-of-pocket cost to patients, as listed on a coupon-based website with a cost as low as $6.76 for 21 1-g tablets. In the authors' experience, it has proven to be a beneficial option.

### FV-100 versus valacyclovir for the prevention of post-herpetic neuralgia and the treatment of acute herpes zoster-associated pain: A randomized-controlled trial [^117VhEe4]. Journal of Medical Virology (2017). High credibility.

The acute HZ burden of illness values over 14, 30, and 90 days (measured by BOI‐14 AUC, BOI‐30 AUC, and BOI‐90 AUC) were evaluated using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model, controlling for stratified age (50‐69 and ≥ 70 years of age), sex, and baseline pain.

The main efficacy analyses were conducted on a modified intent‐to‐treat population (MITT2), defined as all randomized patients who received at least one dose of study drug, except for those whose lesion swabs were positive by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for herpes simplex virus (HSV) and negative by PCR for VZV. The acute HZ burden of illness over 30 days (measured by BOI‐30 AUC) was evaluated using an F test from an analysis of covariance model, controlling for age, gender, and baseline level of pain. BOI‐14 AUC and BOI‐90 AUC were evaluated in the same manner. A sample size of at least 333 patients (111 per arm) was calculated to achieve 80% power to detect a 25% reduction in the mean BOI‐30 AUC in the FV‐100-treated group compared to the valacyclovir-treated group, with a 2‐sided α of 0.05 and a valacyclovir mean BOI‐30 AUC of 91 (SD 60) in the study.

The incidence of PHN at 90 days after lesion appearance was summarized by treatment group and evaluated using the chi‐square test from a logistic regression. The severity of PHN was evaluated using a Poisson model controlling for treatment group, age, sex, and concomitant pain medication. Clinically significant pain (CSP) was defined as a worst pain score > 3 as reported on the ZBPI.

For each study day, treatment group means and corresponding data were analyzed appropriately.

### Low-dose valacyclovir for postherpetic neuralgia in the Zoster Eye Disease Study: A randomized clinical trial [^113wRzv7]. JAMA Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

The study, ZEDS (postherpetic neuralgia), was published in 2025 in the journal JAMA Ophthalmology. The research addresses postherpetic neuralgia and herpes zoster ophthalmicus. The trial investigated the effect of suppressive valacyclovir treatment in patients experiencing pain due to herpes zoster ophthalmicus.

The study was designed as a multi-center, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT) involving 73 patients, with 43 females and 30 males participating.

- **Inclusion criteria**: Adult immunocompetent, nonpregnant patients with a history of herpes zoster ophthalmicus rash, documented keratitis, or iritis within one year.
- **Key exclusion criteria**: Immunocompromised status; renal insufficiency; allergy or adverse reaction to valacyclovir or acyclovir; history of vaccination against zoster within one month before enrollment; keratorefractive surgery; pregnancy or lactation; incarceration.

- **Interventions**:
	- n = 34 received valacyclovir (oral dose of 1,000 mg daily for 12 months).
	- n = 39 received placebo (matching placebo for 12 months).

- **Primary outcome**: No significant difference in the prevalence of postherpetic neuralgia at 12 months (38% vs. 40%; absolute risk difference [ARD] -2.5, 95% confidence interval [CI] -25.8 to 20.8).

- **Secondary outcomes**: Significant decrease in mean pain duration at 18 months (13.6 months vs. 18.7 months; mean difference [MD] -3.3).

### Drugs in development for herpes simplex and varicella zoster virus [^1123Bs77]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

The alpha-herpesviruses varicella zoster virus (VZV) and herpes simplex virus (HSV) share common features, including lifelong persistence in sensory ganglia and the risk of recurrences. For both HSV and VZV, the standard of care (SoC) is based on nucleoside analogs (NAs), which require specific activation in infected cells. These existing drugs exhibit substantial limitations, warranting the development of new and more effective drugs.

### Lip ulceration in an immunocompromised patient [^112mPvxq]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

- **Question 3**: What is the most appropriate treatment?
	- A. Famciclovir
	- B. Intravenous (IV) acyclovir
	- C. IV foscarnet
	- D. IV cidofovir
	- E. IV vidarabine

- **Answers**:
	- A. Famciclovir – Incorrect. Famciclovir is the inactive prodrug of valacyclovir. After oral absorption, famciclovir is deacetylated and oxidized to its active form of valacyclovir. Given that famciclovir, valacyclovir, and acyclovir are nucleoside analogues, none of these would be effective in treating acyclovir-resistant HSV.
	- B. IV acyclovir – Incorrect. Given the patient's immunosuppressed status and lack of response to 1 week of valacyclovir treatment, concern should be raised about acyclovir resistance. Therefore, IV acyclovir would not be an appropriate treatment.
	- C. IV foscarnet – Correct. Acyclovir resistance develops with mutations in the viral thymidine kinase gene. IV foscarnet is the most appropriate treatment for this patient because it does not require activation by viral protein kinases. Foscarnet is a phosphonoformic acid, not a nucleoside analogue, and is a noncompetitive inhibitor of viral DNA polymerase. After administration of IV foscarnet, the patient showed rapid clinical improvement over the subsequent week (Fig 1, B).
	- D. IV cidofovir – Incorrect. Cidofovir is a nucleotide analogue, and in its active diphosphate form, it works by inhibiting DNA polymerase. It is approved for the treatment of cytomegalovirus-induced retinitis in patients with HIV. Although it also has shown activity in resistant HSV infections, it has not been approved for this indication and has carcinogenic and teratogenic side effects.

### Fv-100 versus valacyclovir for the prevention of post-herpetic neuralgia and the treatment of acute herpes zoster-associated pain: A randomized-controlled trial [^112qYcij]. Journal of medical virology (2017). High credibility.

This prospective, parallel-group, randomized, double-blind, multicenter study compared the efficacy and safety of FV-100 with valacyclovir for reducing pain associated with acute herpes zoster (HZ). Patients aged 50 years and older, diagnosed with HZ within 72 hours of lesion appearance and who had HZ-associated pain, were randomized 1:1:1 to a 7-day course of either FV-100 200 mg QD (n = 117), FV-100 400 mg QD (n = 116), or valacyclovir 1000 mg TID (n = 117).

Efficacy was evaluated on the basis of the burden of illness (BOI; Zoster Brief Pain Inventory scores); incidence and duration of clinically significant pain (CSP); pain scores; incidence and severity of post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN); and times to full lesion crusting and lesion healing. Safety was evaluated on the basis of adverse event (AE)/SAE profiles, changes in laboratory and vital signs values, and results of electrocardiograms. The burden of illness scores for pain through 30 days were 114.5, 110.3, and 118.0 for FV-100 200 mg, FV-100 400 mg, and valacyclovir 3000 mg, respectively. The incidences of PHN at 90 days for FV-100 200 mg, FV-100 400 mg, and valacyclovir 3000 mg were 17.8%, 12.4%, and 20.2%, respectively.

Adverse event and SAE profiles of the two FV-100 and the valacyclovir groups were similar, and no untoward signals or trends were evident. These results demonstrate a potential for FV-100 as an antiviral for the treatment of shingles that could both reduce the pain burden of the acute episode and reduce the incidence of PHN compared with available treatments.

### Valacyclovir in the treatment of acute retinal necrosis [^115XKvrf]. BMC Ophthalmology (2012). Low credibility.

The study included ten eyes of nine patients; one patient with HIV co-infection, which was being successfully treated with HAART (CD4 count > 500 cells/mm³ and undetectable viral load), presented with disseminated herpes zoster virus infection and bilateral ARN. Patient and disease characteristics and the results of treatment are summarized in Table 1. The median age at disease onset was 38 years (range 30 to 82 years) and the mean duration of symptoms prior to presentation was 14 days (range 1 to 28 days). Two patients were HIV positive (patients 6 and 8), but the remaining seven patients did not have a history suggestive of underlying immune dysfunction. All ten eyes had at least one discrete focus of peripheral retinal necrosis. Four eyes had zone 2 disease, and three eyes had zone 1 disease. Three eyes had prominent vitritis, and two of these eyes also had optic disc oedema.

- **Clinical findings and response to treatment with oral valacyclovir**:
	- Varicella zoster virus (VZV) was identified as the most likely causative virus in five eyes of four patients. Two cases were proven on PCR, and it was the presumed cause in two further patients, one of whom had disseminated herpes zoster at the time of presentation (patient 8) and one of whom had a history of recent chickenpox infection (patient 2).

	- VZV = Varicella zoster virus; HSV = Herpes simplex virus; PCR = polymerase chain reaction; BCVA = best corrected visual acuity; CFs = count fingers; HMs = hand movements; LP = perception of light; OFSI = Orbital floor corticosteroid injection; RD = retinal detachment.

### Valacyclovir for the suppression of recurrent genital herpes in human immunodeficiency virus-infected subjects [^111wgi6F]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

To determine the efficacy and safety of valacyclovir (500 mg twice daily) for the suppression of genital herpes simplex virus infections in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected subjects, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter international trial was conducted. A total of 293 HIV-seropositive subjects receiving antiretroviral therapy were enrolled.

The proportion of subjects who did not have a recurrence of genital herpes at 6 months was 65% among valacyclovir recipients versus 26% among placebo recipients (relative risk, 2.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.8–3.5). The time to first genital herpes recurrence was significantly shorter in the placebo group (median, 59 days) than in the valacyclovir group (median, > 180 days). Valacyclovir was well tolerated; the incidence of adverse events for the two treatment groups was similar when the duration of treatment was considered. There were no episodes of thrombotic microangiopathy. Valacyclovir was safe and effective for the suppression of genital herpes infection in HIV-infected individuals.

### Comparison between famciclovir and valacyclovir for acute pain in adult Japanese immunocompetent patients with herpes zoster [^112mA732]. The Journal of Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Famciclovir is a guanine analog antiviral drug used commonly for herpes zoster. The efficacy of famciclovir treatment has been reported to be comparable to valacyclovir treatment. Both of these medications reduce the time to complete cessation of zoster-associated pain, including post-herpetic neuralgia, as compared to acyclovir. We conducted a multicenter, randomized, open clinical trial to evaluate the extent of pain relief afforded by these two antiviral drugs during the acute disease phase of herpes zoster.

The study group comprised 86 immunocompetent adult patients suffering from herpes zoster, who were treated with either famciclovir or valacyclovir for 7 days. Of these, 55 patients enrolled in this study within 72 hours of the onset of the rash and 31 patients after 72 hours of the onset. There was a significant reduction in acute herpes zoster pain with famciclovir on day 7 and at 2–3 weeks in both of these patient groups, while with valacyclovir, there was not a significant reduction in pain on day 7. Among patients aged 50 years or older, there was a significantly earlier reduction in pain with famciclovir than with valacyclovir. In addition, a significant reduction in the number of patients with pain was observed as early as days 3–4 with famciclovir treatment as compared with valacyclovir treatment.

We conclude that famciclovir was superior to valacyclovir in the relief of acute pain of herpes zoster. Accordingly, famciclovir is recommended for herpes zoster patients with moderate symptoms and a visual analog scale score of under 50 mm.

### The impact of herpes zoster and post-herpetic neuralgia on quality-of-life [^117E7CsZ]. BMC Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

The duration of pain in vaccine recipients was analyzed in the Shingles Prevention Study. The study compared vaccine recipients who developed herpes zoster and post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN; 315 out of 19,254 recipients) with placebo recipients who developed the disease (641 out of 19,247 recipients). Compared with the placebo group, Zostavax significantly reduced the incidence of PHN, defined as pain persisting at different cut-off times. Notably, pain persisting at 90 days was reduced by 67%. In the total population and sub-groups stratified by sex, the incidence of PHN in each treatment group (vaccine or placebo) was the weighted average of the observed incidence of PHN stratified by age group, with weights proportional to the total number of person-years of follow-up in each age group.

An adverse event substudy of the Shingles Prevention Study revealed that the rates of serious adverse events were higher in the vaccine group (1.9%) compared to the placebo group (1.3%). Injection site reactions were more frequent among vaccine recipients than those receiving the placebo (48.3% versus 16.6%, respectively), though these reactions were generally mild.

The impact of vaccination on quality of life (QoL) was assessed in the entire study population using the Zoster Brief Pain Inventory (ZBPI) and the Zoster Impact Questionnaire (ZIQ). Mean scores from these questionnaires, which rated the 'interference' of herpes zoster and PHN with activities of daily living (ADL), were used to calculate a 'severity of interference score'. For the entire study population, zoster vaccination reduced the ZBPI severity of interference by 66% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 55, 74) and the ZIQ severity of interference by 68% (95% CI: 57, 77).

### Herpes zoster guideline of the German Dermatology Society (DDG) [^111SYEHF]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2003). Low credibility.

Varicella zoster virus (VZV) causes varicella (chickenpox) and remains dormant in dorsal root and cranial nerve ganglia. It can be reactivated as a consequence of declining VZV-specific cellular immunity, leading to herpes zoster (shingles). Patients older than 50 years of age affected by herpes zoster may suffer a significant decrease in quality of life. These patients, along with immunocompromised individuals, are at increased risk for severe complications involving the eye, the peripheral, and the central nervous system (including prolonged pain and postherpetic neuralgia). Such complications can occur with and without cutaneous symptoms.

The German Dermatology Society (DDG) has released guidelines to ensure updated management for anyone affected by herpes zoster.

Diagnosis is primarily clinical. The gold standard of laboratory diagnosis comprises PCR and direct identification of VZV in cell cultures. Detection of IgM- and IgA-anti VZV antibodies may be helpful in immunocompromised patients.

- **Therapy developments**: Therapy has become very effective in recent years. Systemic antiviral therapy can shorten the healing process of acute herpes zoster and prevent or alleviate pain and other complications, especially when administered within 48 to 72 hours after the onset of the rash.

- **Urgent indications for antiviral therapy**: Systemic antiviral therapy is urgently indicated in patients over 50 years old and in patients of any age with herpes zoster in the head and neck area, particularly those with zoster ophthalmicus. Further urgent indications include severe herpes zoster on the trunk and extremities.

### Low-dose valacyclovir for postherpetic neuralgia in the Zoster eye disease study: A randomized clinical trial [^116ANYGC]. JAMA Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

Evidence regarding suppressive valacyclovir treatment on postherpetic neuralgia is necessary to guide care. This study aimed to test the hypothesis that suppressive treatment with 1000 mg/d of oral valacyclovir for 12 months reduces the prevalence, severity, and duration of postherpetic neuralgia compared with placebo at 12 and 18 months in participants with herpes zoster ophthalmicus (HZO).

The study was a multicenter, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial including 527 immunocompetent, nonpregnant adults with a history of HZO rash, documented keratitis, or iritis within 1 year and an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 45 mL/min/1.73 m² or greater. It was conducted at 95 participating sites in Canada, New Zealand, and the US from November 2017 to June 2024. Participant visits occurred every 3 months.

The intervention involved treatment with 1000 mg/d of valacyclovir or placebo for 12 months.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Prevalence of postherpetic neuralgia, severity as determined by pain score (a score of ≥ 3 on a scale of 1–10), pain duration (≥ 3 months after HZO onset), and total daily dose of pain medication.

Of the 527 participants (490 completed 12 months of treatment and 460 completed 18 months), 73 (14%) had postherpetic neuralgia and were analyzed by age at HZO onset (< 60 years or ≥ 60 years) and disease duration (recent [< 6 months] or chronic [≥ 6 months]). Of the 73 participants with postherpetic neuralgia (34 in the valacyclovir group and 39 in the placebo group), the mean age was 62.4 years (SD, 13.6 years), and 59% were evaluated further.

### Fv-100 versus valacyclovir for the prevention of post-herpetic neuralgia and the treatment of acute herpes zoster-associated pain: A randomized-controlled trial [^113pQE1P]. Journal of Medical Virology (2017). Low credibility.

Patients were ≥ 50 years of age, had a clinical diagnosis of herpes zoster (HZ) as evidenced by a unilateral dermatomal rash present for ≤ 72 hours, and experienced zoster-related pain as defined by a ZBPI worst pain score > 0.

Patients were excluded for multidermatomal, disseminated, or ophthalmic HZ; impaired renal function; immunosuppression; gastrointestinal dysfunction that could interfere with absorption; chronic pain requiring narcotic analgesics; the use of tricyclic antidepressants, systemic or cutaneous antivirals within 30 days of enrollment; or CYP3A4-inhibiting protease inhibitors, and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers.

At screening (Day 1), a complete medical history, physical exam, lesion assessment, vital signs, electrocardiogram (ECG), clinical laboratory specimens (blood for hematology and chemistry, and urine for urinalysis), and a lesion swab for qualitative VZV determination were obtained. Pain and zoster pain-related interference in functional categories were evaluated using the ZBPI. When eligibility was confirmed, patients received their first dose of the study drug.

Patients completed visits on Days 3, 5, and 7 during the dosing period, and at Days 10, 14, 21, 30, 42, 56, and 90 post-dose. Lesion assessments continued until complete healing was demonstrated. Patients continued to complete ZBPIs on Days 42, 56, and 90 unless they achieved two consecutive visits (starting on Day 30 or later) without HZ-associated pain.

At each visit, the investigators assessed lesions and patients completed the ZBPI. Blood and urine samples for laboratory tests were collected.

### Fv-100 versus valacyclovir for the prevention of post-herpetic neuralgia and the treatment of acute herpes zoster-associated pain: A randomized-controlled trial [^1111oAMd]. Journal of Medical Virology (2017). Low credibility.

In conclusion, the comprehensive results of the burden of illness, PHN, time to clinically significant pain resolution, and pain score analyses demonstrate a potential role for FV-100 in the reduction of subacute and chronic pain, as well as the prevention of PHN. The safety profile of FV-100 remains favorable both in isolation and when compared to valacyclovir. Antiviral medications have limited effectiveness in the reduction of subacute and chronic pain, do not satisfactorily prevent or adequately treat PHN, and require dosing modifications in patients with renal insufficiencies. The efficacy results from this study support further investigation of FV-100 to address these unmet medical needs.

### Standard-dose and high-dose daily antiviral therapy for short episodes of genital HSV-2 reactivation: Three randomised, open-label, cross-over trials [^1153rDDL]. Lancet (2012). Low credibility.

Skin and mucosal herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) shedding predominantly occurs in short subclinical episodes. We assessed whether standard-dose or high-dose antiviral therapy reduces the frequency of such shedding.

- **Methods**: HSV-2-seropositive, HIV-seronegative people were enrolled at the University of Washington Virology Research Clinic (WA, USA). We conducted three separate but complementary open-label cross-over studies comparing no medication with aciclovir 400 mg twice daily (standard-dose aciclovir), valaciclovir 500 mg daily (standard-dose valaciclovir) with aciclovir 800 mg three times daily (high-dose aciclovir), and standard-dose valaciclovir with valaciclovir 1 g three times daily (high-dose valaciclovir). The allocation sequence was generated by a random number generator. Study drugs were supplied in identical, numbered, sealed boxes. Study periods lasted 4–7 weeks, separated by 1 week wash-out. Participants collected genital swabs four times daily for quantitative HSV DNA PCR. Clinical data were masked from laboratory personnel. The primary endpoint was the within-person comparison of shedding rate in each study group. Analysis was per protocol. The trials are registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00362297, NCT00723229, NCT01346475).

- **Results**: Of 113 participants randomised, 90 were eligible for analysis of the primary endpoint. Participants collected 23,605 swabs; 1,272 (5.4%) were HSV-positive. The frequency of HSV shedding was significantly higher in the no medication group (n = 384, 18.1% of swabs) than in the standard-dose aciclovir group (25, 1.2%).

### FV-100 versus valacyclovir for the prevention of post-herpetic neuralgia and the treatment of acute herpes zoster-associated pain: A randomized-controlled trial [^111qmBXy]. Journal of Medical Virology (2017). Low credibility.

- **Pain endpoints**: Trends in faster resolution of pain in the FV‐100 groups compared to valacyclovir were noted for other a priori endpoints, with potential dose effects observed between the two groups. The mean duration of clinically significant pain (CSP) was 31.3 and 27.3 days in the FV‐100 200 and 400 mg groups respectively, and 32.3 days in the valacyclovir group. These results suggest a dose-response effect with quicker elimination of pain at the higher dose of FV‐100. Similarly, the median duration until the first resolution of CSP was 26.7 and 25.1 days in the FV‐100 200 and 400 mg groups, respectively, versus 28.8 days in the valacyclovir group. A higher proportion of patients achieved a permanent resolution of CSP in the FV‐100 groups (77.6% for the 200 mg dose and 80.5% for 400 mg dose) compared with the patients on valacyclovir (75.2%). From Study Day 14 onward, a difference in mean worst pain scores between valacyclovir and the two FV‐100 doses was observed, with a consistent pattern occurring with least pain, average pain, and pain right now scores favoring the FV‐100 treatment arms.

- **Post‐hoc analyses**: Post hoc analyses were conducted to gain more insight into the effect of FV‐100 on subacute and chronic pain. BOI‐14‐90 AUC and BOI‐30‐90 AUC both showed that patients on FV‐100 generally had lower burdens of illness than those on valacyclovir. A dose response was suggested for BOI‐14‐90 AUC and a trend toward better pain management from week onward.

### Fv-100 versus valacyclovir for the prevention of post-herpetic neuralgia and the treatment of acute herpes zoster-associated pain: A randomized-controlled trial [^113hPZTF]. Journal of Medical Virology (2017). High credibility.

In the post-hoc analysis, the 400 mg dose of FV-100 provided a 20% reduction in the burden of illness for pain in both the 14–90 day periods and 30–90 day periods when compared to valacyclovir. Patients receiving the 400 mg dose of FV-100 experienced on average a 37% reduction in the incidence of PHN over valacyclovir. The proportions of patients on valacyclovir 3000 mg experiencing PHN were comparable to those from previously published reports, which lends validity to the overall design of the study. Average pain scores demonstrated consistent improvement over the 3 months of the study for the FV-100 400 mg group. The consistent advantages of FV-100 over valacyclovir indicate that FV-100 supports a therapeutic role for this new agent in the reduction of subacute and chronic HZ-associated pain.

We acknowledge that the assessment of pain is a relatively subjective measure. However, the ZBPI, developed from the standard Brief Pain Inventory for use in the clinical trials for an anti-HZ vaccine, is a validated instrument for the measurement of HZ-associated pain and the effect of that pain on functional activities of daily living. This index measures the impact of HZ and PHN across all four domains of health: physical, psychological, social, and functional, and is a sensitive and reliable measure of the impact of HZ and PHN on patients' daily lives. Additionally, the use of the worst pain score of ≥ 3 in the definition of PHN has been validated as part of the development of the ZBPI and reflects consensus that this level of pain constitutes clinically meaningful outcomes.

### Identifying optimal vaccination scenarios to reduce varicella zoster virus transmission and reactivation [^111w9tUR]. BMC Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Shingles coverage was modeled as either non-existent (no shingles vaccination) or similar to the estimated coverage values from the United States or the UK. Initial conditions for the vaccinated-with-shingles class were considered to be either 0, or from the recovered-from-chickenpox class, depending on shingles coverage. The model simulated shingles coverage by moving individuals from the vaccinated-with-chickenpox and infected-with-chickenpox classes to the shingles-vaccination class. Shingles length of immunity was considered to be either 5 years or lifelong. Lifelong immunity could be interpreted as every individual who received the shingles vaccine will continue to receive their booster dose, removing the possibility of an individual moving into the latent and susceptible-to-shingles class, or it could represent a new vaccine brought to market (Fig. 5). All scenarios that included shingles vaccination also included one form of chickenpox vaccination, though sensitivity analyses were performed where no chickenpox vaccination occurred. All models were run for 100 years and implemented with the R package pomp.

Though most of the results and discussion focus on the vaccination scenarios listed in Fig. 5b, overall these simulations varied chickenpox vaccine coverage (0–100%), chickenpox vaccine effectiveness (79.5% or 100%), chickenpox vaccination duration of immunity (20 or 40 years), shingles vaccine coverage (0–100%), and shingles vaccination duration of immunity (5 years or lifetime).

### FV-100 versus valacyclovir for the prevention of post-herpetic neuralgia and the treatment of acute herpes zoster-associated pain: A randomized-controlled trial [^111GTbap]. Journal of Medical Virology (2017). Low credibility.

Postherpetic neuralgia is known to cause the largest burden of illness for patients with HZ. A significant proportion of patients with HZ develop PHN despite treatment with antiviral agents. These antivirals require dosing regimens (3–5 times daily) that must be modified for patients with renal impairment. The medications used to treat the pain associated with PHN often fall short in terms of relief for many patients. In addition, pain medications are only palliative and do not provide a cure for HZ. Hence, a drug with greater antiviral activity, the ability to prevent PHN, better pain relief, and a more simplified dosing regimen is needed.

Although there was no statistically significant difference among the treatment groups for the primary endpoint of BOI-30 AUC, a difference between the FV-100 400 mg and valacyclovir groups emerged in the 90-day period data (a 14% reduction), suggesting a potential effect of FV-100 on subacute and chronic pain. Numerical differences in the incidence and severity of PHN at 90 days favored both doses of FV-100 over valacyclovir. These results represent a clinically meaningful reduction in pain with FV-100. Faster resolution of pain in both the FV-100 groups compared to valacyclovir was consistently noted, with potential dose effects observed between the two FV-100 groups. The mean duration of CSP was shorter in the FV-100 groups compared with the valacyclovir group. Likewise, the resolution of CSP was quicker, and a higher proportion of patients achieved a permanent resolution of CSP in the FV-100 groups.

### Suppressive therapy versus episodic therapy with oral valacyclovir for recurrent herpes labialis: Efficacy and tolerability in an open-label, crossover study [^112neubN]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Oral valacyclovir's efficacy and tolerability as suppressive therapy versus episodic therapy were compared for recurrent herpes labialis (RHL). Subjects with a history of at least three RHL episodes in the past year were randomized to receive six months of oral valacyclovir episodic therapy at the first sign of prodrome (two 2-g doses separated by 12 hours) and six months of oral valacyclovir suppressive therapy (1 g once daily) in an open-label, crossover fashion. The mean ± SE number of recurrences per 120 days of follow-up (primary endpoint) was lower with suppressive therapy (0.30 ± 0.41) than with episodic therapy (0.71 ± 0.79) [P < 0.05]. Furthermore, the probability of remaining recurrence-free was greater over time (up to 180 days) for suppressive therapy [P = 0.021].

- **Secondary efficacy endpoints**: Data for secondary efficacy endpoints, such as pain severity score, mean duration of recurrences, and maximal total lesion area, showed approximately a 30% to 50% reduction in mean values with suppressive therapy compared with episodic therapy. However, results were statistically significantly different between the regimens for pain severity only.

- **Adverse events**: The percentage of subjects with at least one adverse event over six months of treatment that was considered to be drug-related was 3% with suppressive therapy and 6% with episodic therapy.

Suppressive therapy with oral valacyclovir was more effective than episodic therapy with oral valacyclovir in reducing the frequency of recurrences.

### Fv-100 versus valacyclovir for the prevention of post-herpetic neuralgia and the treatment of acute herpes zoster-associated pain: A randomized-controlled trial [^113MLmok]. Journal of Medical Virology (2017). Low credibility.

- **Background**: Varicella zoster virus (VZV) is a human alpha herpes virus, which causes varicella (chicken pox) and herpes zoster (HZ). Approximately one out of three people in the United States aged 60 years or older will develop shingles.

Herpes zoster results from the reactivation of latent VZV and its spread from the ganglion to the corresponding cutaneous dermatome. The characteristic vesicular rash (shingles) of HZ pustulates and crusts within 7–10 days but may take up to a month to heal. However, pain is an important feature of the disease that is often the most debilitating for patients. Zoster-associated pain is experienced by approximately 90% of patients. The chronic neuropathic pain phase of the disease, known as postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), is defined as pain that persists 90 days or more after rash onset.

Postherpetic neuralgia causes the largest HZ-related burden of illness. Risk factors for PHN include greater acute pain severity, presence of a prodrome, greater rash severity, and older patient age at onset. Interventions for PHN, such as lidocaine patches, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants, and anti-epileptics, are palliative and fail to treat the underlying disease. A substantial proportion of patients fail to obtain satisfactory pain relief using the available medications. This pain burden is associated with negative effects on their quality of life, such as impaired physical functioning, higher levels of emotional stress, and decreases in social functioning.

### Valacyclovir in the treatment of acute retinal necrosis [^111saqc4]. BMC Ophthalmology (2012). Low credibility.

There is a wide variation in the reported 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC₅₀) of acyclovir in vitro: 0.02 to 13.5 μM for HSV-1, 0.01 to 9.9 μM for HSV-2, and 0.12 to 10.8 μM for VZV. Administration of oral valacyclovir 1 g tid has been shown to achieve plasma concentrations in excess of the IC₅₀ for most clinical isolates of HSV-1, HSV-2, and VZV throughout the dosage period, as has administration of famciclovir 500 mg tds. However, this dose still only achieves daily acyclovir area under the concentration-time (AUC) values similar to those obtained with intravenous acyclovir 5 mg/kg tid. In contrast, valacyclovir 2 g tid produces a daily AUC of 109 μg·h⁻¹ mL⁻¹, which is similar to that achieved by intravenous acyclovir 10 mg/kg tid at 107 μg·h⁻¹ mL⁻¹.

We treated our patients with oral valacyclovir 2 g tid based on the understanding that this would achieve AUC values similar to intravenous acyclovir 10 mg/kg tid without exposing patients to the side effects associated with higher doses of valacyclovir, such as the development of thrombotic microangiopathy, and without compromising patient compliance throughout a long treatment duration. The 2 g tid dose was well tolerated in our patients, and no patient developed systemic adverse effects associated with treatment.

Limitations of this study include its retrospective nature and small sample size, which mean that it is not possible to comment on the efficacy of oral prednisolone or prophylactic barrier laser. The short duration of follow-up may also skew incidence rates for reactivation of disease in fellow eyes.

### The impact of herpes zoster and post-herpetic neuralgia on quality-of-life [^114MRsf8]. BMC Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

To be effective, antiviral agents must be administered within 72 hours of acute symptom onset, which may be difficult due to delays in patients seeking medical advice and reaching a diagnosis (for example, because of unusual symptom presentation). Often, viral activity and neuronal damage have been ongoing for several days before appropriate treatment is given. Even with prompt treatment, antiviral treatment does not prevent all cases of PHN. A recent Cochrane Review demonstrated that oral acyclovir does not significantly reduce PHN incidence. The review highlighted that there is insufficient evidence from randomized controlled trials to determine if other antiviral agents prevent PHN and if these treatments have a beneficial impact on QoL. Twenty studies of antiviral treatment for acute HZ were identified, but 14 were excluded from the Cochrane review, mainly due to limitations in study design.

A recent Canadian study of patients with HZ rash or pain showed that pain resolution is associated with recovery of QoL to a pre-morbid state (personal communication). Data showed that the median duration of pain was equal to the median duration of QoL impairment. Once established, the pain associated with HZ or PHN is difficult to treat. PHN remains largely refractory to pharmacological treatments and prevention strategies. Data shows that more than 50% of patients require more than one prescription drug for PHN. Despite treatment, symptomatic relief is obtained in only 50% of patients. Patients with PHN experience significantly less pain relief than those with HZ.

### FV-100 versus valacyclovir for the prevention of post-herpetic neuralgia and the treatment of acute herpes zoster-associated pain: A randomized-controlled trial [^115gpLDz]. Journal of Medical Virology (2017). High credibility.

Of the 466 patients screened, 350 were randomized and received at least one dose of the study drug (Figure 1). Some patients (34) were excluded due to their low creatinine clearance (< 50 mL/min/1.73 m²), leaving 329 for the modified ITT efficacy analysis. The mean age of patients was 64.6 years, and most patients (65%) were women. All other baseline demographic characteristics were similar between groups. Approximately 15% of the patients overall had a history of herpes zoster (HZ), with a mean number of prior occurrences of 1.5 for the study (range 1–5). Fewer than 5% of the patients had received the HZ vaccine.

- **Figure 1 - Study flow chart**: The chart shows the relationships between all analysis populations. All patients were included in both the safety and ITT populations. The differences in numbers between the safety and ITT populations are due to errors in dispensing for two patients who received a treatment different from their randomized assignment. The ITT population consisted of all randomized patients who received at least one dose of the study drug. The MITT1 population consisted of all randomized patients who received at least one dose of the study drug, except for patients whose lesion swabs were positive by PCR for HSV and negative by PCR for VZV or who had a calculated creatinine clearance < 50 mL/min/1.73 m². The MITT2 population consisted of all randomized patients who received at least one dose of the study drug, except for patients whose lesion swabs were positive by PCR for HSV and negative by PCR for VZV. The per-protocol population consisted of all patients.

### A photodistributed eruption in an immunosuppressed patient [^116sjYEn]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

- **Question 3**: What is the best treatment for this patient?
- **A. Drug discontinuation**: Incorrect. In phototoxic drug reactions, the mainstay of treatment is the identification and cessation of the causative agent. In cases where discontinuation is not possible, patients should be instructed to avoid the sun and practice strict sun protection.
- **B. Hydroxychloroquine**: Incorrect. Antimalarials such as hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, and quinacrine are the first-line systemic therapy for cutaneous lupus erythematosus. Systemic medications are recommended in cases of cutaneous lupus erythematosus that are severe, widespread, or refractory to topical therapies.
- **C. Immediate initiation of valacyclovir**: Correct. The treatment of choice for VZV infection in individuals at greater risk for complications, including adults and immunocompromised patients, is antiviral therapy. The most commonly used antiviral agents are acyclovir and valacyclovir, which function by inhibiting viral DNA polymerase and subsequently VZV replication. Our patient was treated with 1 gram of valacyclovir 3 times daily for 14 days and reported significant improvement after completion of the treatment course.
- **D. Phlebotomy**: Incorrect. The standard treatment for patients with porphyria cutanea tarda is regular phlebotomy to reduce iron and porphyrin levels in the liver.
- **E. Supportive care**: Incorrect. Varicella has a low complication rate, especially in children, and can be treated with supportive care.

### What's old is new: Valacyclovir for the treatment of pityriasis rosea, a retrospective case series [^114SNdP7]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Low credibility.

Valacyclovir is noted as the prodrug of acyclovir, resulting in similar safety profiles. Some common side effects of valacyclovir include headache, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, joint pain, and rash. Severe rash, such as the Stevens-Johnson syndrome–toxic epidermal necrolysis spectrum, has been described in one case report after treatment with acyclovir. However, to our knowledge, there are no reports of this severe cutaneous adverse reaction after valacyclovir use at the time of writing. No patient in our case series reported adverse effects or side effects from taking valacyclovir for the specified dose and duration. Additionally, no patient had to discontinue the week-long course due to medication side effects, and no patient required renal dosing adjustment.

All patients in this case series reported either significant improvement (44.4%) or total resolution (55.6%) with the proposed treatment, suggesting that valacyclovir may be considered a reasonable treatment option for pityriasis rosea (PR). Six of nine patients treated with valacyclovir had complete resolution or significant improvement of their rash in less than six weeks, which is shorter than the cited duration of 6 weeks to 6 months with spontaneous resolution. Of the three patients monitored with a rash for longer than six weeks, patient nine experienced the eruption for 12 weeks before evaluation in our clinic. Despite flaring after COVID-19 vaccination and failing potent topical corticosteroid treatment, her rash and quality of life were greatly improved at her 2-week follow-up.

### Management strategies of acute retinal necrosis: Current perspectives [^116CUkUF]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Low credibility.

Additional case series by Emerson et al. and Taylor et al. assessed the use of oral valacyclovir without intravitreal therapy in patients with similar outcomes. Emerson et al. reviewed six eyes from four patients who were treated with oral valacyclovir, 1000 mg three times daily, or famciclovir, 500 mg three times daily, for a total duration of 5 weeks to 3 months. Symptoms and visual acuity improved within 2 to 4 weeks for three of the four patients. Neither eye with initial unilateral involvement developed findings in the fellow eye.

Taylor et al. reviewed ten eyes of nine patients who were treated with oral valacyclovir. Observed retinitis resolved in 100% of affected eyes, with a median time to complete resolution of 21 days. None of the patients experienced either disease reactivation or second eye involvement over the course of the study. The body of evidence suggests that oral and intravenous therapy have comparable outcomes and that either is effective for induction therapy; however, future studies should directly compare oral versus intravenous antiviral therapy in the initial management of acute retinal necrosis.

### Viremia in acute herpes zoster [^114Axb19]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

A phase 2 trial was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of a topical antiviral, sorivudine, as an adjuvant to valacyclovir for the treatment of acute herpes zoster.

- **Methods**: In this randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial, 25 patients were treated with either sorivudine or placebo cream. All patients began 7 days of valacyclovir treatment on day 3. Zoster lesion swab samples and samples of peripheral blood mononuclear cells were collected periodically throughout the study and were analyzed for varicella-zoster virus (VZV) DNA using both qualitative and real-time polymerase chain reaction. Serum samples collected periodically throughout the study were also analyzed for VZV DNA using real-time polymerase chain reaction.

- **Results**: VZV DNA was detected in all 3 sample types, and the number of viral copies correlated with the progression of herpes zoster. No statistically significant differences were seen between the placebo- and sorivudine-treated groups with respect to clinical characteristics or laboratory test results.

- **Conclusion**: The detection of VZV DNA in the serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cells of all 25 zoster patients documents that viremia is a common manifestation of herpes zoster. Sorivudine cream appears to be a safe and well-tolerated adjuvant therapy; however, further phase 2 studies are needed to determine its clinical efficacy for the treatment of herpes zoster.

### Varicella-zoster virus in the saliva of patients with herpes zoster [^117FagMt]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Fifty-four patients with herpes zoster were treated with valacyclovir. On treatment days 1, 8, and 15, pain was scored, and saliva was examined for varicella-zoster virus (VZV) DNA. VZV DNA was found in every patient on the day treatment was started and later disappeared in 82% of the cases. There was a positive correlation between the presence of VZV DNA and pain, as well as between VZV DNA copy number and pain (P < .0005).

- **Presence of VZV DNA**: VZV DNA was present in 1 patient before the rash and in 4 patients after pain had resolved.

It was not present in any of the 6 subjects with chronic pain or in the 14 healthy subjects. Analysis of human saliva has potential usefulness in diagnosing neurological disease produced by VZV without rash.

### Fv-100 versus valacyclovir for the prevention of post-herpetic neuralgia and the treatment of acute herpes zoster-associated pain: A randomized-controlled trial [^111yDCRw]. Journal of Medical Virology (2017). Low credibility.

Clinicians should not underestimate the severity of neuralgic pain. Some studies of postherpetic neuralgia suggest that early attenuation of acute pain may prevent the onset of central mechanisms of chronic pain, thus potentially reducing the risk of postherpetic neuralgia. Antiviral therapies, such as FV‐100, may inhibit these mechanisms of pain transmission.

Several design characteristics likely affected the study's ability to identify statistically significant differences between the two antiviral agents, including the use of BOI as a primary efficacy measure, a pain score of > 0 at study entry, and the possibility that 14 days may not have been a sufficient length of time for differences in pain to be assessed. However, this Phase 2 study demonstrated proof of concept for FV‐100 in terms of efficacy and safety in the treatment of HZ and provided valuable data, which guided the subsequent design of a potentially pivotal Phase 3 trial.

Despite the availability of antiviral drugs approved for the treatment of HZ, and the HZ vaccine, up to 40% of all patients with HZ will develop PHN. Pain associated with PHN is often refractory to treatment, and symptomatic relief is obtained in fewer than half of PHN sufferers despite the frequent use of multiple drugs for pain control. While the majority of patients experience complete resolution of their pain by one year, long‐term studies indicate that PHN may persist indefinitely. Taken as a whole, these findings highlight the challenges and complexities in managing this condition.

### Oral antivirals revisited in the treatment of herpes zoster: What do they accomplish [^113Pwqp8]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

Oral antiviral agents currently represent the most important therapeutic keystone in the treatment of herpes zoster. Three oral antiviral agents are available for the treatment of herpes zoster: acyclovir, its derivative valacyclovir, and famciclovir. Meta-analysis of published data has shown that oral acyclovir significantly reduces various herpes zoster-related symptoms as well as the duration, intensity, and prevalence of zoster-associated pain (ZAP). However, this drug does not influence postherpetic neuralgia. The newer agents, famciclovir and valacyclovir, exhibit better oral bioavailability than acyclovir. These agents have demonstrated similar efficacy to acyclovir with ZAP and they require less frequent administration. When initiated within 72 hours, oral antiviral therapy of herpes zoster is beneficial in selected, elderly immunocompetent patients, reducing the duration and intensity of ZAP and providing more rapid skin lesion healing. Oral antivirals are also beneficial in immunocompromised patients with uncomplicated herpes zoster. However, signs of cutaneous and visceral dissemination should be monitored; if signs occur, intravenous antiviral therapy is indicated.

### Zoster prophylaxis after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation using acyclovir/valacyclovir followed by vaccination [^112Vb8MN]. Blood Advances (2016). Low credibility.

Varicella zoster virus (VZV) disease, which is usually cutaneous zoster, occurs frequently after hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), and postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) results in poor quality of life. The optimal prophylaxis of VZV disease and PHN has not been established. At our center, before 2008, VZV prophylaxis consisted of approximately one year of post-HCT acyclovir/valacyclovir ("old strategy"). Post-2008, the prophylaxis consisted of two years of acyclovir/valacyclovir followed by immunization using the varicella vaccine ("new strategy").

We conducted a retrospective study comparing the cumulative incidence of VZV disease and PHN among patients who completed the old strategy (n = 153) versus the new strategy (n = 125). Patients who completed the old strategy had a significantly higher cumulative incidence of VZV disease (33% vs. 17% at 5 years, P ≤ .01) and PHN (8% vs. 0% at 5 years, P = 0.02). In conclusion, VZV prophylaxis with two years of acyclovir/valacyclovir followed by vaccination appears to result in a low incidence of VZV disease and may eliminate PHN.

- **Cold sores (herpes labialis)**: Two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials were conducted in 1,856 healthy adults and adolescents (aged 12 years and older) with a history of cold sores. Subjects self-initiated therapy at the earliest symptoms, prior to any visible signs. Most subjects began treatment within 2 hours of symptom onset. They were randomized to receive VALTREX 2 grams twice daily on Day 1 followed by placebo on Day 2, VALTREX 2 grams twice daily on Day 1 followed by 1 gram twice daily on Day 2, or placebo on both Day 1 and Day 2.

	- The mean duration of cold sore episodes was approximately 1 day shorter in treated subjects compared to those on placebo. The 2-day regimen did not offer additional benefit over the 1-day regimen. No significant difference was observed between subjects receiving VALTREX and those on placebo in preventing the progression of cold sore lesions beyond the papular stage.

- **Genital herpes infections**:

	- **Initial episode**: Six hundred forty-three immunocompetent adults with first-episode genital herpes, who presented within 72 hours of symptom onset, were randomized in a double-blind trial. Participants received either 10 days of VALTREX 1 gram twice daily (n = 323) or oral acyclovir 200 mg 5 times a day (n = 320). In both treatment groups, the median time to lesion healing was 9 days, the median time to cessation of pain was 5 days, and the median time to cessation of viral shedding was 3 days.

	- **Recurrent episodes**: Three double-blind trials (two of them placebo-controlled) were conducted in immunocompetent adults with recurrent genital herpes.
