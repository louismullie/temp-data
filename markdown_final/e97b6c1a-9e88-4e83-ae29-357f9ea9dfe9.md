## Question

egfr limit for starting spironolactone?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the eGFR thresholds for starting spironolactone, including when it is safe to initiate therapy across different indications and how to monitor and adjust dosing. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and why eGFR matters for hyperkalemia and renal function changes. Then, I should verify guideline-based thresholds for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Next, I will examine heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) nuances. After that, I need to check resistant hypertension thresholds and the role of potassium binders. I will then review primary aldosteronism and edema/cirrhosis scenarios. Finally, I should synthesize a practical, indication-specific recommendation with monitoring cadence and dose adjustments, and consider alternatives like finerenone when eGFR is low or hyperkalemia risk is high.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and risks. Spironolactone's principal safety concerns in CKD are hyperkalemia and a reversible hemodynamic decline in eGFR, both of which rise as eGFR falls; these risks are amplified when combined with ACE inhibitors or ARBs, so I need to ensure we anchor thresholds to both eGFR and potassium at baseline and during follow-up [^116HAUpi] [^116CFDL8] [^116SUhnT].

> Now, for HFrEF, I should verify the guideline minimum eGFR. The 2022 AHA/ACC/HFSA guideline recommends initiating spironolactone or eplerenone if eGFR is greater than 30 mL/min/1.73 m² and serum potassium is less than 5.0 mEq/L, with close monitoring of potassium and renal function. eGFR ≤ 30 mL/min/1.73 m² is effectively a contraindication to initiation in this context, and dose should be halved when eGFR is 30–49 mL/min/1.73 m², typically starting 25 mg every other day rather than 25 mg daily [^114ykgDS] [^111RKLXp] [^116HAUpi] [^1144boag].

> Wait, let me verify the dose stratification detail because I initially thought "start 25 mg daily universally". Hold on, I should verify the label and guideline nuance: for eGFR 30–50 mL/min/1.73 m², both FDA labeling and guideline practice support starting at 25 mg every other day due to hyperkalemia risk, whereas for eGFR > 50 mL/min/1.73 m², 25 mg daily is acceptable, with uptitration to 50 mg if tolerated and potassium remains ≤ 5.0 mEq/L [^117YJcLQ] [^116HAUpi].

> Next, I will examine HFpEF. I need to check whether the same eGFR threshold applies. Post hoc and guideline analyses suggest potential benefit in appropriately selected symptomatic HFpEF patients with eGFR > 30 mL/min/1.73 m², creatinine < 2.5 mg/dL, and potassium < 5.0 mEq/L, but the signal is weaker and hyperkalemia and creatinine rises are more common; thus, the practical threshold mirrors HFrEF, but the evidentiary bar is lower and monitoring must be stricter [^113sQxRC] [^115hwKXm].

> For resistant hypertension, I should confirm the more conservative eGFR threshold. The 2018 ESC/ESH guidance restricts routine spironolactone use to eGFR > 45 mL/min/1.73 m² and potassium ≤ 4.5 mmol/L, reflecting the PATHWAY-2 population and safety profile; in eGFR 30–45 mL/min/1.73 m², use is generally discouraged unless necessary, and if used, requires caution and frequent potassium checks, ideally with a potassium binder strategy in higher-risk CKD [^1116iDo5] [^114mZvNb]. Let me double-check the 2025 AHA/ACC guidance: it supports spironolactone as fourth-line for resistant hypertension and notes robust BP reductions when eGFR is ≥ 45, aligning with the European stance, while acknowledging intolerance rates of 4–40% due to hyperkalemia or antiandrogenic effects [^1175cRQ2] [^114MvDJA].

> I should confirm the role of potassium binders to enable spironolactone in CKD with resistant hypertension. The AMBER program demonstrated that patiromer substantially increased persistence on spironolactone in eGFR 25–45 mL/min/1.73 m², though hyperkalemia rates remained high and adherence to binder therapy waned over time; this supports a cautious, binder-enabled approach in selected patients with close lab surveillance rather than routine use below eGFR 30 [^114mZvNb] [^112qMRjo].

> Let me consider primary aldosteronism. I need to ensure we do not conflate general hypertension thresholds with PA-specific therapy. For medically managed PA, spironolactone is first-line due to cost and availability, and while many clinicians use a practical eGFR threshold around 30 mL/min/1.73 m² with careful monitoring, the endocrine guideline emphasizes individualized dosing and vigilant potassium and renal monitoring rather than a rigid numeric cutoff; nonetheless, severe CKD still heightens hyperkalemia risk and warrants conservative dosing and close labs [^115Rhs2M] [^116eXTzN].

> For edema due to cirrhosis, I should review whether eGFR-based restrictions are specified. The FDA labeling recommends inpatient initiation with slow titration and does not provide a specific eGFR threshold, but general hyperkalemia precautions apply; in practice, many clinicians avoid or use very low doses if eGFR is < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² due to impaired potassium handling, and any use should be accompanied by frequent electrolyte and renal checks [^117YJcLQ] [^117YJcLQ].

> I will now examine the evidence for lower eGFR ranges to ensure I am not overgeneralizing. The BARACK-D randomized trial in stage 3b CKD (mean eGFR ~43.5) showed no cardiovascular benefit and high early discontinuation from eGFR declines and hyperkalemia, reinforcing that spironolactone should not be used for primary cardiovascular prevention in moderate CKD without a compelling indication like HFrEF or PA, and that tolerability is poor in this population [^112MPGyB] [^1138uhNq] [^115Gkirr]. But wait, what if a patient has diabetes and albuminuria? In that scenario, finerenone — not spironolactone — is the MRA with proven cardiorenal benefit down to eGFR 25 mL/min/1.73 m², which shifts practice away from spironolactone in advanced CKD with diabetic kidney disease [^115mgeXV] [^116Yjjmr].

> Let me synthesize a practical, indication-specific answer. For HFrEF, initiate spironolactone if eGFR > 30 mL/min/1.73 m² and potassium < 5.0 mEq/L, start 25 mg every other day if eGFR 30–50 and 25 mg daily if eGFR > 50, then uptitrate to 50 mg if tolerated with ongoing potassium and renal checks. For HFpEF, consider only if symptomatic, eGFR > 30, creatinine < 2.5 mg/dL, and potassium < 5.0, with heightened vigilance. For resistant hypertension, prefer use when eGFR ≥ 45 and potassium ≤ 4.5–5.0, and if eGFR 30–45 and absolutely necessary, employ patiromer and frequent labs. For primary aldosteronism, individualize with close monitoring rather than a strict eGFR cutoff, but avoid or use extreme caution if eGFR < 30. For cirrhotic edema, initiate in hospital and titrate slowly with electrolyte surveillance, avoiding use in severe renal dysfunction when possible [^114ykgDS] [^111RKLXp] [^1116iDo5] [^1175cRQ2] [^117YJcLQ].

> Next, I should review monitoring cadence to ensure safety. I need to check potassium and creatinine/eGFR within 3–7 days of initiation or dose change, again at 1 week to 1 month depending on stability, then every 3–6 months once stable, with more frequent checks if eGFR is 30–50, potassium is borderline, or interacting drugs are added. Hold or reduce dose if potassium reaches 5.5–5.9 mEq/L and discontinue if ≥ 6.0 mEq/L, and reassess if eGFR falls by more than about 30% from baseline or there is symptomatic hypotension or intercurrent illness [^116HAUpi] [^115jZRBm] [^117Y1Mmc].

> Hold on, I should verify the dose-related hyperkalemia signal. Observational and trial data suggest hyperkalemia risk rises with higher spironolactone doses, with markedly higher event rates at 50 mg versus 25 mg daily; this supports using the lowest effective dose, especially in CKD, and explains why many clinicians cap at 25 mg in patients with eGFR 30–50 or higher potassium risk [^111wXj6X] [^111UrRph].

> Finally, I need to ensure I address alternatives when thresholds are not met. If eGFR is < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² or potassium is ≥ 5.0 mEq/L, avoid initiating spironolactone and consider non-steroidal MRA therapy (finerenone) for patients with type 2 diabetes and albuminuria down to eGFR 25, or prioritize other antihypertensive strategies such as chlorthalidone for resistant hypertension in advanced CKD. These choices align with contemporary nephrology and endocrine guidance and help mitigate hyperkalemia while addressing cardiorenal risk [^115mgeXV] [^116Yjjmr] [^114mZvNb] [^112uqw8b].

---

The minimum eGFR for starting spironolactone is **≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m²** for heart failure [^114ykgDS] and **≥ 45 mL/min/1.73 m²** for resistant hypertension [^1116iDo5]. For eGFR 30–49 mL/min/1.73 m², use **lower starting doses** (12.5–25 mg every other day) [^117YJcLQ] and monitor potassium and renal function closely [^116HAUpi]. Avoid initiation if **eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m²** or **potassium ≥ 5.0 mmol/L** due to hyperkalemia and renal function risks [^1137mjsn] [^111RKLXp].

---

## Indication-specific eGFR thresholds

### Heart failure

- **HFrEF**: Initiate spironolactone if eGFR ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m² and potassium < 5.0 mmol/L [^114ykgDS] [^111RKLXp].
- **HFpEF**: Consider spironolactone if eGFR > 30 mL/min/1.73 m², potassium < 5.0 mmol/L, and close monitoring is feasible [^113sQxRC].
- **Dosing**: For eGFR 30–49 mL/min/1.73 m², start 12.5–25 mg every other day; for eGFR ≥ 50 mL/min/1.73 m², start 25 mg daily [^117YJcLQ] [^116HAUpi].

---

### Resistant hypertension

For resistant hypertension, **eGFR ≥ 45 mL/min/1.73 m²** is recommended before initiating spironolactone [^1116iDo5] [^114MvDJA]. If **eGFR 30–44 mL/min/1.73 m²**, consider only if benefits outweigh risks, with close monitoring [^114mZvNb] [^117DfjMN].

---

### Primary aldosteronism

For primary aldosteronism, **eGFR ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m²** is preferred before starting spironolactone, with individualized dosing and monitoring [^115Rhs2M].

---

## Risks associated with low eGFR

Patients with **eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m²** face increased risks of hyperkalemia and worsening renal function when starting spironolactone [^114ykgDS]. Hyperkalemia risk rises as eGFR declines, especially with concomitant ACE inhibitors or ARBs [^116HAUpi] [^115hwKXm]. A reversible decline in GFR may occur, particularly in advanced CKD [^116CFDL8] [^116m9Re1].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting eGFR thresholds

- **RALES**: Benefits persisted even with reduced eGFR, but hyperkalemia and renal events were more frequent at lower eGFR [^1175aXgb].
- **EMPHASIS-HF**: Eplerenone reduced events across eGFR strata, with more hyperkalemia at lower eGFR despite lower doses [^114mtCuR].
- **BARACK-D**: In CKD stage 3b, spironolactone showed no outcome benefit and high discontinuation from hyperkalemia and eGFR decline [^1138uhNq] [^115Gkirr].

---

## Monitoring and dose adjustment strategies

- **Baseline assessment**: Check potassium and eGFR before starting therapy [^111RKLXp].
- **Initial monitoring**: Recheck potassium and eGFR within 2–4 weeks of initiation or dose change [^116HAUpi].
- **Ongoing monitoring**: Monitor potassium and renal function regularly, especially if eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m² or potassium ≥ 4.5 mmol/L [^116HAUpi].
- **Dose adjustments**: Reduce dose or hold if potassium rises to 5.5–6.0 mmol/L; discontinue if potassium ≥ 6.0 mmol/L or if eGFR declines > 30% from baseline [^117Y1Mmc].

---

## Alternative therapies for patients with low eGFR

- **Nonsteroidal MRAs**: Finerenone is recommended for T2D with CKD and albuminuria when eGFR ≥ 25 mL/min/1.73 m² and potassium is normal [^115mgeXV] [^116Yjjmr].
- **Potassium binders**: Patiromer or sodium zirconium cyclosilicate can enable spironolactone use in resistant hypertension with CKD by reducing hyperkalemia [^112qMRjo] [^114mZvNb].
- **Alternative antihypertensives**: Chlorthalidone or loop diuretics are options for resistant hypertension when eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m² [^notfound].

## EGFR thresholds and recommendations

| **Indication** | **Minimum eGFR** | **Recommendations** |
|-|-|-|
| HFrEF | ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m² | Initiate if potassium < 5.0 mmol/L; use lower doses if eGFR 30–49 [^114ykgDS] [^116HAUpi] |
| HFpEF | > 30 mL/min/1.73 m² | Consider with close monitoring [^113sQxRC] |

### Efficacy and safety of spironolactone in patients with HFpEF and chronic kidney Disease [^115hwKXm]. JACC: Heart Failure (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

This study investigated the association between baseline renal function and the net benefit of spironolactone in patients with heart failure (HF) with a preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF).

Background

Guidelines recommend consideration of spironolactone to reduce HF hospitalization in HFpEF. However, spironolactone may increase risk for hyperkalemia and worsening renal function, particularly in patients with chronic kidney disease.

Methods

This investigation analyzed data from patients enrolled in the TOPCAT (Treatment of Preserved Cardiac Function Heart Failure With an Aldosterone Antagonist Trial) Americas study (N = 1,767) to examine the association between the baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and the primary composite outcome of cardiovascular death, HF hospitalization, or aborted cardiac arrest, as well as safety outcomes, including hyperkalemia, worsening renal function, and permanent drug discontinuation for adverse events (AEs). Variations in the efficacy and safety of spironolactone according to eGFR were examined in Cox models using interaction terms.

Results

The incidence of both the primary outcome and drug-related AEs increased with declining eGFR. Compared with placebo, across all eGFR categories, spironolactone was associated with lower relative risk for the primary efficacy outcome and for hypokalemia, but higher relative risk for hyperkalemia, worsening renal function, and drug discontinuation. During 4-year follow-up, the absolute risk for AEs that prompted drug discontinuation was amplified in the lower eGFR categories, which suggested heightened risk for drug intolerance with declining renal function.

Conclusions

Although consistent efficacy of spironolactone was observed across the range of eGFR, the risk of AEs was amplified in the lower eGFR categories. These data supported use of spironolactone to treat HFpEF patients with advanced chronic kidney disease only when close laboratory surveillance is possible.

### Beneficial effects of adding spironolactone to recommended antihypertensive treatment in diabetic nephropathy: a randomized, double-masked, cross-over study [^112mUHFk]. Diabetes Care (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of this study was to evaluate the safety and short-term effect of adding spironolactone to conventional antihypertensive treatment including diuretics and maximally recommended doses of an ACE inhibitor or an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) on albuminuria and blood pressure in type 2 diabetic patients with nephropathy.

Research Design and Methods

Twenty-one type 2 diabetic patients with nephropathy were enrolled in a randomized, double-masked, cross-over study. Patients were treated in random order with spironolactone 25 mg once daily and matched placebo for 8 weeks, respectively, in addition to ongoing antihypertensive treatment including diuretics and maximally recommended doses of an ACE inhibitor and/or an ARB. At the end of each treatment period, albuminuria, 24-h ambulatory blood pressure (ABP), and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) were determined.

Results

During the addition of placebo, values were as follows: albuminuria (geometric mean [range]) 1,566 [655–7,762] mg/24 h, ABP (mean ± SE) 138 ± 3/71 ± 1 mmHg, and GFR (mean ± SE) 74 ± 6 ml/min per 1.73 m2. During the addition of spironolactone, albuminuria was reduced by 33% (95% CI 25–41) (P < 0.001), fractional clearance of albumin by 40% (24–53) (P < 0.001), and 24-h ABP by 6 mmHg (2–10) for systolic and 4 mmHg (2–6) for diastolic (P < 0.001 for both). The change in albuminuria did not correlate with the change in systolic 24-h ABP (r = 0.19, P = 0.42) or diastolic 24-h ABP (r = 0.01, P = 0.96). Spironolactone treatment induced an insignificant reversible reduction in GFR of 3 ml/min per 1.73 m2 (-0.3 to 6) (P = 0.08). One patient was excluded from the study due to hyperkalemia. Otherwise treatment was well tolerated.

Conclusions

Our study suggests that spironolactone safely adds to the reno- and cardiovascular protective benefits of treatment with maximally recommended doses of ACE inhibitor and ARB by reducing albuminuria and blood pressure in type 2 diabetic patients with nephropathy.

### Changing from the CKD-EPI to the EKFC creatinine equation to estimate glomerular filtration rate in adults in a Northern European health system [^111dK6ze]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The European Kidney Function Consortium (EKFC) 2021 equation to estimate GFR performs as well or better than the CKD-EPI 2009 equation in predominantly white adult European populations, with less bias and greater accuracy against measured GFR. This study explores how changing from the CKD-EPI to the EKFC equation in a large European health system may impact disease distribution, prognosis and clinical decisions.

Methods

We studied over 1.7 million adults in Stockholm undergoing routine care during 2006–2021. We compared eGFR values and reclassification across KDIGO GFR categories when changing from the CKD-EPI to EKFC equation and examined associations of eGFR and reclassification with risk for kidney failure with replacement therapy (KFRT), mortality, and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) using Cox models. We also modelled the impact of eGFR equation change on clinical decisions like nephrology referral or medication eligibility/contraindication.

Results

EKFC yielded modestly lower eGFR values than CKD-EPI by a median (IQR) of -4.9 (-8.3 to -2.2) mL/min/1.73 m². As a result, CKD G3-G5 prevalence rose from 4.5% to 6.2%. Both equations strongly predicted KFRT, mortality, and MACE. Participants reclassified to lower eGFR categories were older; after adjustment for age, participants had similar risks of mortality and MACE to those not reclassified and a lower risk of KFRT. Changing to the EKFC equation would impact clinical decisions at low eGFR thresholds, such as nephrology referrals (22% higher), eligibility for SGLT2is (39% higher) or contraindication for spironolactone in heart failure (26% higher).

Conclusions

Adopting the EKFC equation in this Northern European health system would modestly lower eGFR estimates, increasing the prevalence of moderate/severe CKD and affecting clinical classification and decisions. eGFR by both equations strongly predicted outcomes, but individuals reclassified to a lower eGFR category by EKFC did not have consistent associations across outcomes.

### Hypertension in chronic kidney disease-treatment standard 2023 [^115TfUpd]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). Medium credibility.

Hypertension is very common and remains often poorly controlled in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Accurate blood pressure (BP) measurement is the essential first step in the diagnosis and management of hypertension. Dietary sodium restriction is often overlooked, but can improve BP control, especially among patients treated with an agent to block the renin-angiotensin system. In the presence of very high albuminuria, international guidelines consistently and strongly recommend the use of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker as the antihypertensive agent of first choice. Long-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers and diuretics are reasonable second- and third-line therapeutic options. For patients with treatment-resistant hypertension, guidelines recommend the addition of spironolactone to the baseline antihypertensive regimen. However, the associated risk of hyperkalemia restricts the broad utilization of spironolactone in patients with moderate-to-advanced CKD. Evidence from the CLICK (Chlorthalidone in Chronic Kidney Disease) trial indicates that the thiazide-like diuretic chlorthalidone is effective and serves as an alternative therapeutic opportunity for patients with stage 4 CKD and uncontrolled hypertension, including those with treatment-resistant hypertension. Chlorthalidone can also mitigate the risk of hyperkalemia to enable the concomitant use of spironolactone, but this combination requires careful monitoring of BP and kidney function for the prevention of adverse events. Emerging agents, such as the non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist ocedurenone, dual endothelin receptor antagonist aprocitentan and the aldosterone synthase inhibitor baxdrostat offer novel targets and strategies to control BP better. Larger and longer term clinical trials are needed to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of these novel therapies in the future. In this article, we review the current standards of treatment and discuss novel developments in pathophysiology, diagnosis, outcome prediction and management of hypertension in patients with CKD.

### Guidance for incorporating FDA processes into the ACC / AHA clinical practice guideline methodology: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^115jPqs2]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Resistant hypertension — alternatives to spironolactone and use of adjunct agents — Eplerenone, a more selective steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA), is a potential alternative to spironolactone, but randomized controlled trials have not demonstrated reduction of home BP or 24-hour BP at doses between 25 and 100 mg daily when compared with placebo, and effective treatment may require higher dosages; use of nonsteroidal MRA for treating resistant hypertension in patients with moderate to advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) has not been tested in a clinical trial but may be considered in selected patients with close monitoring of serum potassium. When spironolactone or eplerenone are not tolerated due to side effects or cost, amiloride (10–20 mg) has been shown to be as effective as spironolactone in adults with resistant hypertension. Other alternative fourth- and fifth-line drug therapies include beta-blockers (BBs), alpha blockers, central sympatholytic drugs, and direct vasodilators; however, direct vasodilators such as hydralazine and minoxidil should be used in combination with a BB and a loop diuretic. Aprocitentan, a dual endothelin A and B receptor antagonist, was shown to reduce 24-hour ambulatory SBP by 4 to 6 mm Hg compared with placebo in adults with resistant hypertension when added to a CCB, renin–angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitor, and hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), but it has not been directly compared with spironolactone and its side effects of leg edema and fluid retention (9%-18%) may be prohibitive in some patients.

### Mitigating risk of aldosterone in diabetic kidney disease [^113kf5j8]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

STEROIDAL MINERALOCORTICOID RECEPTOR ANTAGONISTS

The correlation between aldosterone levels and breakthrough with decline in GFR supports aldosterone as a target for intervention in DKD in individuals on ACEi or ARB. The steroidal MRA spironolactone is potent but nonselective causing gynecomastia. Spironolactone was investigated in doses 25–50 mg/day in combination with ACEi or ARBs in individuals with T1D or T2D, microalbuminuria, macroalbuminuria or nephrotic range albuminuria in 16 studies lasting 2–18 months demonstrating a significant 39% reduction in albuminuria with the major concern being a more than six-fold increased risk for hyperkalemia particularly in individuals with impaired renal function. Similar data were found in meta-analyses including diabetic and nondiabetic CKD. A recent 72 weeks intervention study with four arms combining irbesartan 150 or 300 mg daily with spironolactone 20 mg or placebo confirmed long-term 30% antiproteinuric effect and safety in elderly with T2D and DKD [estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) > 45 ml/min/1.73 m 2] when spironolactone was add-on to irbesartan. Prevention of DKD (onset of microalbuminuria and loss of eGFR) in T2D, with spironolactone is being tested in the 3-year PRIORITY study including normoalbuminuric patients with high risk for DKD determined from a urinary proteomics-based risk pattern for CKD (CKD273). The study includes only individuals with GFR more than 60 ml/min/1.73 m 2, to reduce the risk of hyperkalemia.

We did not collect absolute values for people with a normal result. Participants had a blood test taken at baseline and also an ECG, where available at their GP surgery. These results were reviewed by their own GP, who reported the results back to the study team as either normal, abnormal (not clinically significant) or abnormal (clinically significant). Absolute values were not collected at these stages, only this categorical data.

BP, blood pressure; ECG, electrocardiogram.

At the end of 3 years of follow-up, 1,052 participants remained in the study. The median follow-up time was 3 years. Overall mean follow-up was 131 weeks, with a mean follow-up of 126 weeks in the spironolactone arm, compared to 135 weeks in the usual care arm. There were 182 (26.9%) participants in the spironolactone group who withdrew, discontinued or were lost to follow-up, compared to 147 (21.2%) in the usual care group (odds ratio 1.37, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.07–1.76, P = 0.013). However, only a third of patients continued taking spironolactone beyond 6 months, although many of these participants continued trial follow-up. The median time from randomization to withdrawal from treatment was 3.2 months (IQR: 0.98–18.1).

The study was ongoing during the COVID-19 pandemic, which impacted the planned follow-up, especially blood monitoring. For example, 88.0% of participants completed the year 2 study visit, compared to 95.0% at 6 months. Although the primary endpoint components were available for all participants, at 3-year follow-up, only 71.1% of participants had a systolic blood pressure recorded and 71.4% an eGFR. Both groups were affected similarly by this disruption to follow-up.

### Spironolactone (Aldactone) [^116m3i1X]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Regarding the use of spironolactone PO (also known as Aldactone, Carospir) in patients with eGFR > 50 mL/min/1.73 m²:
- Use acceptable.
- No dose adjustment required.
- Monitor renal function. Monitor serum potassium.

### Guidance for incorporating FDA processes into the ACC / AHA clinical practice guideline methodology: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^117BvrK2]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Table 18 — GDMT for patients with hypertension and heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) outlines class-specific use and thresholds: In patients with HFrEF, even if asymptomatic, the table notes use of 1 of the 3 BBs proven to reduce mortality and hospitalizations (bisoprolol, carvedilol, metoprolol succinate). In patients with symptomatic HFrEF, spironolactone or eplerenone is recommended to reduce morbidity and mortality if eGFR is ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m² and potassium is ≤ 5.0 mEq/L. In patients with HFrEF and NYHA functional class II to III symptoms, ARNi is recommended to reduce morbidity and mortality; when the use of ARNi is not feasible, ACEi or ARB is recommended to reduce morbidity and mortality. SGLT2i are recommended in patients with symptomatic HFrEF to reduce hospitalization and cardiovascular mortality irrespective of the presence of type 2 diabetes. For patients self-identified as Black with NYHA functional class II to IV HFrEF receiving optimal medical therapy, the combination of hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate is recommended to improve symptoms and reduce morbidity and mortality, and in patients with current or previous symptomatic HFrEF who cannot be given first-line agents because of drug intolerance or renal insufficiency, a combination of hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate might be considered to reduce morbidity and mortality.

### Change in renal function associated with drug treatment in heart failure: national guidance [^114Fafef]. Heart (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The interaction between treatment for heart failure and decline in renal function is frequently misunderstood and commonly used as a reason to withhold potentially life-prolonging therapy. The misunderstanding is not helped by referring to RAAS inhibitors as 'nephrotoxic' drugs, which they most emphatically are not. Well-meaning but poorly evidenced recommendations to give patients 'sick day rules'have the potential to cause harm when patients stop their medication for minor illness (or fail to restart them once illness has passed). Perhaps of even greater concern is inaccurate advice given by bodies such as the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, which suggested that 'concomitant use of spironolactone with ACEi or ARB is not routinely recommended'. The combination is, of course, of vital importance to patients with symptomatic HFrEF; however, close monitoring of renal function and potassium is vital when using MRA and other RAAS inhibitor together.

There is a danger that concerns over renal function may prevent patients receiving medication beneficial to their long-term outcome. While decline in renal function is important and may require drugs to be stopped, that should only be after very careful consideration of the risks and benefits to the individual patient (figure 3).

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Practical use of aldosterone antagonists — patient selection and renal function–based dosing — emphasizes that some who meet trial criteria "may need to be excluded" in practice for recent renal dysfunction or hyperkalemia, particularly with insulin-requiring diabetes. In the elderly, "estimated creatinine clearance less than 50 mL per min should trigger a reduction of the initial dose of spironolactone to 12.5 mg daily or of eplerenone to 25 mg daily", and "aldosterone antagonists should not be given when creatinine is less than 30 mL per minute". Patients "chronically requiring high doses of diuretics without potassium replacement should be evaluated closely".

In June 2023, the European Society of Hypertension (ESH) presented and published the new 2023 ESH Guidelines for the Management of Arterial Hypertension, a document that was endorsed by the European Renal Association (ERA). Following the evolution of evidence in recent years, several novel recommendations relevant to the management of hypertension in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) appeared in these Guidelines. These include recommendations for target office blood pressure (BP) < 130/80 mmHg in most and against target office BP < 120/70 mmHg in all patients with CKD; recommendations for use of spironolactone or chlorthalidone for patients with resistant hypertension with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) higher or lower than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2, respectively; use of a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor for patients with CKD and estimated eGFR ≥ 20 mL/min/1.73 m2; use of finerenone for patients with CKD, type 2 diabetes mellitus, albuminuria, eGFR ≥ 25 mL/min/1.73 m2 and serum potassium < 5.0 mmol/L; and revascularization in patients with atherosclerotic renovascular disease and secondary hypertension or high-risk phenotypes if stenosis ≥ 70% is present. The present report is a synopsis of sections of the ESH Guidelines that are relevant to the daily clinical practice of nephrologists, prepared by experts from ESH and ERA. The sections summarized are those referring to the role of CKD in hypertension staging and cardiovascular risk stratification, the evaluation of hypertension-mediated kidney damage and the overall management of hypertension in patients with CKD.

### Spironolactone dose in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: findings from TOPCAT [^113PpUPA]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

Aims

Spironolactone up-titration may be limited by side effects that could be minimized at lower than target doses, but whether lower than target doses remain efficacious is unknown. In TOPCAT, spironolactone (or placebo) were started at 15mg/day, and increased up to a maximum of 45mg/day. The prognostic implications related to spironolactone dose are yet to be reported. We aimed to assess the average spironolactone/placebo doses provided during the trial, overall and within high-risk subgroups (e.g. elderly, renal dysfunction, high potassium); discontinuation rates; and the efficacy of lower than target doses in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.

Methods and Results

Overall, 1767 patients from 'TOPCAT-Americas' were included. Linear, logistic and Cox regressions were applied. Patients randomized to spironolactone received lower doses than placebo: 22.5 (15.0–27.5) mg/day vs. 27.5 (17.5–27.5) mg/day (P < 0.001). Patients aged ≥ 75years, with an estimated glomerular filtration rate ≤ 60mL/min/1.73m 2, and with potassium levels > 4.5mmol/L, received lower spironolactone doses (median≈20mg/day). This pattern of dose differences was not observed in patients taking placebo, where the between-subgroup placebo doses were similar (spironolactone-placebo by subgroup P interaction < 0.05). Among patients taking spironolactone, 25.4% discontinued the drug during the first year, compared with 18.3% of the patients taking placebo (P < 0.001). Discontinuation rates in the aforementioned high-risk subgroups reached 30% during the first year. Spironolactone reduced the primary outcome of heart failure hospitalization/cardiovascular death without significant heterogeneity between the study subgroups (P interaction > 0.1). Spironolactone discontinuation was associated with a two to fourfold higher risk of subsequent events.

Conclusion

Spironolactone (but not placebo) was used at lower doses among the elderly, those with renal dysfunction and with higher potassium levels. The effect of spironolactone was homogeneous across these subgroups. In patients unable to tolerate target doses, a low-dose strategy should be preferred to stopping treatment.

### Guidance for incorporating FDA processes into the ACC / AHA clinical practice guideline methodology: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^115jZRBm]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Kidney dysfunction/injury — monitoring and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitor (RAASi) effects are outlined with explicit thresholds. Estimated GFR using serum creatinine should be measured 2 to 4 weeks after initiation or dose titration of antihypertensive medications. RAASi may cause an expected short-term dip in eGFR of up to 30% that is associated with preservation of kidney function and should not lead to discontinuation unless the decline in eGFR is persistently > 30%. A referral to a nephrologist is appropriate to evaluate other causes, and new dysfunction after adding or increasing diuretics should prompt evaluation of volume status; it may be appropriate to initially hold or reduce the diuretic dose and then advance more slowly.

### Renal function stratified dose comparisons of eplerenone versus placebo in the EMPHASIS-HF trial [^114mtCuR]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Current heart failure guidelines recommend target eplerenone dose of 50mg/day. We have examined the effect of different eplerenone doses based on pre-specified renal function stratification in the Eplerenone in Mild Patients Hospitalization and Survival Study in Heart Failure (EMPHASIS-HF).

Methods and Results

In EMPHASIS-HF, the target dose of eplerenone/placebo was stratified at randomization according to estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR): 50mg/day if eGFR ≥ 50mL/min/1.73m 2 and ≤ 25mg/day if eGFR 30–49mL/min/1.73m 2. Patients remained within these dose ranges during the trial (as per stratification). The primary outcome was a composite of heart failure hospitalization or cardiovascular mortality. Eplerenone was superior to placebo within each respective eGFR stratum [eplerenone vs. placebo in the eGFR ≥ 50mL/min/1.73m 2 stratum: hazard ratio (HR) 0.58, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.45–0.74; and eplerenone vs. placebo in the eGFR 30–49mL/min/1.73m 2 stratum: HR0.62, 95% CI 0.49–0.78; P interaction = 0.89]. Despite receiving lower eplerenone doses, patients in the eGFR 30–49mL/min/1.73m 2 stratum more often had hyperkalaemia, renal failure events, and drug discontinuation.

Conclusion

In EMPHASIS-HF the eplerenone dose was stratified according to renal function and the treatment effect was not influenced by renal function: 25mg/day in patients with eGFR 30–49mL/min/1.73m 2 was as effective as 50mg/day in patients with eGFR ≥ 50mL/min/1.73m 2. However, patients with impaired renal function experienced more adverse events, despite reveiving lower eplerenone doses. Current guidelines do not recommend tailoring the dose of eplereone according to renal function but the current data suggest they should.

### Potassium management with finerenone: practical aspects [^114ZQiCr]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

4 POTASSIUM MANAGEMENT AND POTASSIUM CONCENTRATIONS IN FIDELIO‐DKD and FIGARO‐DKD

In the FIDELIO‐DKD and the FIGARO‐DKD trials, hyperkalemia was reported using thresholds of > 5.5 mmol/L for mild hyperkalemia and > 6.0 to < 6.5 mmol/L for moderate hyperkalemia, in accordance with the latest KDIGO guidance based on the protocol. The earliest time point after which serum potassium was measured in both trials was 1 month after treatment initiation. The second scheduled assessment of serum potassium was at the fourth month after treatment initiation and at 4‐month intervals thereafter. The frequency of potassium monitoring in both trials was consistent with that recommended in the KDIGO guidelines for patients with CKD (3–4 times per year for patients with UACR > 300 mg/g and eGFR < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 and 2–3 times per year for patients with UACR 30–300 mg/g and eGFR 15–59 ml/min per 1.73 m 2). In both trials, the risk of hyperkalemia from finerenone (14.0%) versus placebo (6.9%) was more than doubled. This occurred despite the fact that potassium‐increasing drugs other than ACE inhibitors and ARBs were prohibited and subjects with baseline potassium concentrations > 4.8 mmol/L were excluded from the trials.

Finerenone had a predictable impact on serum potassium concentrations in both trials with a maximum difference in mean serum potassium between groups of 0.23 mmol/L in FIDELIO‐DKD and 0.16 mmol/L in FIGARO‐DKD. Given the higher mean eGFR in the FIGARO‐DKD trial compared with the FIDELIO‐DKD trial (68 vs. 44 ml/min/1.73 m 2), the incidence of hyperkalemia with finerenone treatment was lower in the former (10.8% vs. 18.3%), despite the longer median follow‐up (3.4 vs. 2.6 years). Of note, a post‐hoc analysis of the FIDELIO‐DKD data showed that independent risk factors for mild hyperkalemia were higher serum potassium, lower eGFR, increased urine albumin/creatinine ratio, younger age, female sex, ß‐blocker use, and finerenone assignment. Diuretic or SGLT2 inhibitor use reduced risk.

### Low-dose spironolactone and cardiovascular outcomes in moderate stage chronic kidney disease: a randomized controlled trial [^113bPnR2]. Nature Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

Clinicians at participating practices were encouraged to manage all participants' blood pressure according to NICE guidelines, and the mean results suggested that most participants achieved a reduction in systolic blood pressure across follow-up regardless of the randomization group. Patients in both arms had adjustments made to their blood pressure treatment, and this may have diluted the treatment effect of spironolactone, where some potential reduction in cardiovascular events and mortality would be expected to be achieved through hypertension control.

Recruitment was challenging for several reasons. We found there were fewer eligible patients than anticipated at participating practices, a relatively low response rate to take part in the study among eligible patients and difficulty recruiting additional new practices to the study. The study was designed so that participants would attend 15 study visits across 3 years. People with CKD are typically older with a high burden of multiple long-term conditions and may have been put off volunteering for the study because of concerns around the number of study visits, their own medication burden, the interaction of spironolactone with their current treatment, potential side effects from the drug or issues with mobility and access to healthcare services for follow-up. Future trials could consider using more routinely collected health data to reduce the burden of appointments and demands on study participants in the future to improve recruitment.

Future research could seek to determine if there is a treatment effect from nonsteroidal MRAs, such as finerenone, among a broader population of patients with CKD, such as people without type 2 diabetes or significant albuminuria, to determine whether the positive findings reported in the FIDELITY study could be replicated more widely. Given the high incidence of hyperkalemia associated with spironolactone, other antihypertensive agents, such as ACEi or ARB, may continue to be considered as treatments for blood pressure in preference to MRA in people with CKD. However, one benefit of spironolactone compared to finerenone is its relative effectiveness in reducing blood pressure. A future trial could investigate whether spironolactone could prevent the progression of CKD or reduce vascular events if it were combined with a potassium-binding agent to reduce discontinuation rates due to hyperkalemia.

### Low-dose spironolactone and cardiovascular outcomes in moderate stage chronic kidney disease: a randomized controlled trial [^112ExzFr]. Nature Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

Although it is possible that our study failed to detect a treatment effect of spironolactone because of the comparatively small sample size, there is no suggestion of this from the data. Two-thirds of participants randomized to spironolactone discontinued treatment within the first 6 months, largely due to them meeting prespecified 'stop' criteria, such as prespecified reductions in renal function. The high number of participants who discontinued spironolactone treatment at an early stage may be important in explaining our results and implies that poor tolerability of spironolactone is a barrier to its use in this population. The difference in results between the finerenone trials and the BARACK-D trial may be explained by the differences in tolerability and efficacy of spironolactone as a steroidal MRA compared to the nonsteroidal MRA, finerenone. Finerenone may have additional benefits compared to spironolactone, such as an antifibrotic effect in the heart and inhibition of the expression of pro-inflammatory markers in the kidney. Finerenone is also associated with a low risk of hyperkalemia and hypotension, meaning discontinuation rates are likely to be lower than for spironolactone, and more participants are able to continue on treatment.

The differences in trial results may also partly relate to differences in the study populations. The BARACK-D trial population were mainly older participants (mean age of 74.8 years versus median age of 64.8 years in the FIDELITY study), with CKD mainly defined by age-related kidney impairment. In contrast, the finerenone trial populations involved CKD participants mainly defined by kidney damage in the context of diabetes. The mean baseline eGFR in our study was lower than the FIDELITY study (43.5 versus 57.5 mL min −1 1.73 m − 2), but 98.2% of those in the FIDELITY study had moderate to significant proteinuria, compared to a mean baseline urinary ACR of just 1.5 mg mmol −1 (IQR = 0.6–4.3) in BARACK-D. Despite the encouraging results of finerenone, our study suggests that the results cannot be immediately applied to older populations with CKD without diabetes or albuminuria.

Mineralocorticoid Receptor Antagonists

MRAs (spironolactone and eplerenone) reduce mortality and hospitalizations due to HF in patients with HFrEF, but in these trials, only patients with CKD stages 1 to 3 were enrolled. In the RALES trial (Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study), spironolactone exhibited similar risk reduction in all-cause mortality and the combined outcome of all-cause mortality and hospital stay for HF, compared with patients with higher baseline eGFR. However, these benefits went along with an increased risk of hyperkalemia and worsening renal function, but the substantial net benefit of spironolactone therapy remained. Similarly, in a post hoc analysis in patients with an eGFR of 30 to 60 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 of the EMPHASIS-HF trial (Eplerenone in Mild Patients Hospitalization and Survival Study in Heart Failure), eplerenone was equally effective to reduce cardiovascular death or HHF (hospitalization for heart failure), which was consistent across the different eGFR strata. Patients treated with eplerenone had an increased risk of potassium > 5.5 mmol/L but not of potassium > 6.0 mmol/L. Given these data, a close monitoring of renal function and potassium is warranted in patients with HF and CKD, especially if eGFR declines.

No data from large clinical trials exist in patients with CKD stages 4 and 5, and these agents are formally contraindicated in advanced CKD. The DOHAS (Dialysis Outcomes Heart Failure Aldactone Study) trial, a prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled, open-label trial in 5 Japanese centers, investigated the use of spironolactone in oligoanuric hemodialysis patients versus a control group. In this population, spironolactone reduced the primary outcome — a composite of death from cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events or hospitalization for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. Ongoing large-scale studies such as the ACHIEVE trial (Aldosterone Blockade for Health Improvement Evaluation in End-Stage Renal Disease; unique identifier: NCT03020303) and ALCHEMIST (Aldosterone Antagonist Chronic Hemodialysis Interventional Survival Trial; unique identifier: NCT01848639) will shed more light on this topic.

Diuretics

Diuretics are recommended in patients with HFrEF with signs and/or symptoms of congestion to alleviate HF symptoms, improve exercise capacity, and reduce HF hospitalizations. Diuretics are effective in patients with HFrEF and CKD, but there are no specific endpoint data for patients with CKD. A recent consensus document from the HF Association of the European Society of Cardiology suggests a practical approach for initiation and uptitration of multilevel, guideline-directed medical therapy for different levels of eGFR in patients with HFrEF(see Figure 5).

### Incidence, predictors and clinical management of hyperkalaemia in new users of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists [^111UrRph]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2018). Low credibility.

We looked at the prescribed doses in the last spironolactone prescription prior to hyperkalaemia. The most commonly prescribed dose was 25 mg/day (in 65% of participants), followed by 50 mg/day (23% of participants) (Figure 2 A). Dosages exhibited a weak association with the patient's underlying kidney function (Figure 2 B). Daily MRA doses of 50 mg were more common among moderate and severe hyperkalaemias compared to mild ones (online supplementary Figure S6).

Figure 2
Distribution of prescribed spironolactone dosages at index hyperkalaemia and in relation to kidney function. eGFR, estimated glomerular filtration rate.

After hyperkalaemia occurrence, 53% of participants continued MRA therapy, 47% discontinued. Among those who remained on therapy, 10% reduced the prescribed MRA dose (Table 3). Discontinuation of concomitant ACEi/ARB use occurred in 282 (23%) of cases, being slightly more common among those who discontinued MRA (28%) compared to those who continued (19%). As many as 45% of participants received de novo diuretics, and 1.6% started SPS. MRA discontinuation or dose reduction was slightly more common after moderate/severe compared to mild hyperkalaemias (Table 3). Likewise, more participants received diuretics or SPS after a moderate/severe event compared to mild events. Timing of therapy also influenced prescription patterns. As compared to late events, hyperkalaemias occurring within the first 3 months of MRA therapy were more often followed by MRA discontinuation, MRA dose reductions and prescription of diuretics, or SPS. Findings were similar in the subpopulation of patients with heart failure (online supplementary Table S10).

### Guidance for incorporating FDA processes into the ACC / AHA clinical practice guideline methodology: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^113LJ97t]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Resistant hypertension — medication contributors and foundational regimen — Approximately 20% of adults with hypertension reported regular use of over-the-counter or nonprescription medications that may directly raise BP, and these medications are associated with uncontrolled BP and should be reviewed during evaluation of patients with resistant hypertension; some prescription drugs known to elevate BP should be replaced with alternative agents that avoid hypertensive side effects, if possible. Antihypertensive drug therapy should start with a combination of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), a calcium channel blocker (CCB), and a diuretic, and replacing thiazide-type diuretics with thiazide-like diuretics may offer additional BP reduction and cardiovascular protection. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have shown that addition of spironolactone (25–50 mg/day) as the fourth drug reduced home and 24-hour systolic blood pressure (SBP) by 6.6 to 8.7 mm Hg compared with placebo in patients with resistant hypertension and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 45 mL/ min/1.73 m2; the reduction in BP was greater than with addition of doxazosin or bisoprolol and greater than clonidine, yet 4% to 40% of adults with resistant hypertension cannot tolerate spironolactone due to hyperkalemia or antiandrogenic side effects.

Results

Participant disposition

In total, 1,985 participants attended a screening visit between 6 December 2013 and 31 August 2018, with 1,434 participants randomized into the study (Fig. 1). Of those randomized, 62 participants were identified as ineligible for the study by the supervising trials unit, including 33 participants who had been randomized to spironolactone and 29 randomized to usual care, leaving 1,372 participants who were included in the statistical analyses. The trial failed to recruit to the target, achieving 45% of the planned sample size. There were ten patients in the usual care arm who were initiated on spironolactone at some point during the study by their general practitioner (GP). At the time of randomization, the mean age of participants was 74.8 years (s.d. = 8.1) with 54.5% women (Table 1). There was a high burden of comorbid CVD among the population, including hypertension (76.7%), type 2 diabetes (24.3%), ischemic heart disease (17.4%) and atrial fibrillation (12.2%). The mean eGFR at baseline was 43.5 mL min −1 1.73 m − 2 (s.d. = 6.9) and ACR 1.5 mg mmol −1 (interquartile range (IQR) = 0.6–4.3). The majority of participants were prescribed either an ACEi (40.0%) or an ARB (36.6%). Only four participants were prescribed a sodium–glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor. The study population was well-balanced between groups.

Hypertension evaluation for resistant cases and primary hyperaldosteronism — screening and treatment guidance — states that patients should be screened if they have resistant HTN (> 140/90 mm Hg) on ≥ 3 medications, including a maximum-dose diuretic. A mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) (eg, eplerenone, spironolactone) is the rational choice for medical management of primary hyperaldosteronism and can be considered for resistant HTN in persons with T2D. More frequent laboratory monitoring of potassium and kidney function should be performed when an ACEi or ARB is combined with an MRA.

### Influence of baseline and worsening renal function on efficacy of spironolactone in patients with severe heart failure: insights from RALES (randomized aldactone evaluation study) [^1175aXgb]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study investigated the influence of baseline and worsening renal function (WRF) on the efficacy of spironolactone in patients with severe heart failure (HF).

Background

Renal dysfunction or decline in renal function is a known predictor of adverse outcome in patients with HF, and treatment decisions are often on the basis of measures of renal function.

Methods

We used data from the RALES (Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study) in 1,658 patients with New York Heart Association functional class III or IV HF and an ejection fraction < 35%. Participants were randomized to spironolactone 25 mg, which could be titrated to 50 mg, or placebo daily. Renal function (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR]) was estimated by the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation. Worsening renal function was defined as a 30% reduction in eGFR from baseline to 12 weeks post-randomization.

Results

Individuals with reduced baseline eGFR exhibited similar relative risk reductions in all-cause death and the combined endpoint of death or hospital stays for HF as those with a baseline eGFR > 60 ml/min/1.73 m(2) and greater absolute risk reduction compared with those with a higher baseline eGFR (10.3% vs. 6.4%). Moreover, WRF (17% vs. 7% for spironolactone and placebo groups, p < 0.001) was associated with an increased adjusted risk of death in the placebo group (hazard ratio: 1.9, 95% confidence interval: 1.3 to 2.6) but not in those randomized to spironolactone (hazard ratio: 1.1, 95% confidence interval: 0.79 to 1.5, p interaction = 0.009). The risk of hyperkalemia and renal failure was higher in those with worse baseline renal function and those with WRF, particularly in the spironolactone arm, but the substantial net benefit of spironolactone therapy remained.

Conclusions

The absolute benefit of spironolactone was greatest in patients with reduced eGFR. Worsening renal function was associated with a negative prognosis, yet the mortality benefit of spironolactone was maintained.

### Low-dose spironolactone and cardiovascular outcomes in moderate stage chronic kidney disease: a randomized controlled trial [^117Y1Mmc]. Nature Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

Monitoring of adverse events

For safety monitoring, adverse events were recorded at trial visits, and any adverse event that was considered related to the study medication as judged by a medically qualified member of the research team or the sponsor was followed up until resolution or until the event was considered stable. Serious adverse events were reported by participating sites to the Clinical Trials Unit within 24 h of discovery or notification of the event. The documentation was then reviewed by a medically qualified member of the trial team, who evaluated the report for causality and expectedness. Any suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions were reported to the competent authorities (MHRA in the UK), the Research Ethics Committee concerned and the host NHS trusts, within the timelines defined in the Medicines for Human Use (Clinical Trials) Regulations, 2004.

Specific 'stop rules' were set by the independent Data Monitoring and Ethics Committee (DMEC) and took into consideration the established risks of spironolactone. We measured serum creatinine and potassium at every study visit. If a potassium result was between 5.5 and 5.9 mmol l −1, the dose of spironolactone was reduced to 25 mg on alternate days. If the result was between 6.0 and 6.4 mmol l −1, spironolactone was withheld for a week and then restarted on alternate days. Spironolactone was discontinued if there was a single potassium result ≥ 6.5 mmol l −1. Participants were also withdrawn from trial treatment if there was a reduction in eGFR of 20% or more between successive visits or 25% or more from baseline, a systolic blood pressure reading < 100 mm Hg or a symptomatic postural drop in systolic blood pressure > 20 mm Hg. Physicians were strongly encouraged to manage participants' blood pressure according to the NICE guidelines on CKD and on hypertension, which recommended a target clinic blood pressure < 140/90 mm Hg.

### Effects of spironolactone and chlorthalidone on cardiovascular structure and function in chronic kidney disease: a randomized, open-label trial [^114Bb7rE]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

In a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, treatment with spironolactone in early-stage CKD reduced left ventricular mass and arterial stiffness compared with placebo. It is not known if these effects were due to BP reduction or specific vascular and myocardial effects of spironolactone.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

A prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded end point study conducted in four UK centers (Birmingham, Cambridge, Edinburgh, and London) comparing spironolactone 25 mg to chlorthalidone 25 mg once daily for 40 weeks in 154 participants with nondiabetic stage 2 and 3 CKD (eGFR 30–89 ml/min per 1.73 m 2). The primary end point was change in left ventricular mass on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. Participants were on treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker and had controlled BP (target ≤ 130/80 mm Hg).

Results

There was no significant difference in left ventricular mass regression; at week 40, the adjusted mean difference for spironolactone compared with chlorthalidone was -3.8 g (95% confidence interval, -8.1 to 0.5 g, P = 0.08). Office and 24-hour ambulatory BPs fell in response to both drugs with no significant differences between treatment. Pulse wave velocity was not significantly different between groups; at week 40, the adjusted mean difference for spironolactone compared with chlorthalidone was 0.04 m/s (-0.4 m/s, 0.5 m/s, P = 0.90). Hyperkalemia (defined ≥ 5.4 mEq/L) occurred more frequently with spironolactone (12 versus two participants, adjusted relative risk was 5.5, 95% confidence interval, 1.4 to 22.1, P = 0.02), but there were no patients with severe hyperkalemia (defined ≥ 6.5 mEq/L). A decline in eGFR > 30% occurred in eight participants treated with chlorthalidone compared with two participants with spironolactone (adjusted relative risk was 0.2, 95% confidence interval, 0.05 to 1.1, P = 0.07).

Conclusions

Spironolactone was not superior to chlorthalidone in reducing left ventricular mass, BP, or arterial stiffness in nondiabetic CKD.

### Patient characteristics and initiation of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists in patients with chronic kidney disease in routine clinical practice in the US: a retrospective cohort study [^116AUYVH]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with a gradual, progressive loss of kidney function. It is classified into five stages of severity, culminating in end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The prevalence of CKD was recently estimated to be 11–13% globally, with moderate (stage 3) CKD being the most common. CKD is often co-incident with several chronic conditions including obesity, diabetes, hypertension and heart failure (HF). The rising prevalence of obesity and diabetes worldwide, particularly in low- to middle-income countries, has further increased the burden of CKD to society. The presence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) is the leading cause of ESRD, and the presence of CKD in patients with T2D has been shown to increase cardiovascular morbidity and mortality dramatically.

Overactivation of the mineralocorticoid receptor present in both cardiac and renal cells in response to elevated aldosterone levels, high salt load, increased plasma glucose or increased reactive oxygen species generation plays an important role in cardiovascular disease and CKD. Available research suggests that the steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs), spironolactone and eplerenone, reduce blood pressure, especially in resistant hypertension, reduce cardiovascular mortality and hospitalizations in HF and improve albuminuria excretion in CKD. However, the potential benefit of steroidal MRAs is limited by numerous adverse reactions, including hyperkalemia and worsening renal function.

Previous research has not investigated the association between steroidal MRAs and therapeutic outcomes in patients with CKD and various comorbid conditions. This study was conducted to explore real-world steroidal MRA use and clinical characteristics of the respective patient populations and to identify predictors of MRA use in these populations.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Resistant hypertension — initial combination therapy and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) use — Antihypertensive drug therapy should start with a combination of an ACEi or ARB, a CCB, and a diuretic. Replacing thiazide-type diuretics (eg, HCTZ or bendroflumethiazide) with thiazide-like diuretics (eg, chlorthalidone and indapamide) may offer additional BP reduction and cardiovascular protection among patients with previous MI or stroke. Randomized controlled trials have shown that addition of spironolactone (25–50 mg/day) as the fourth drug reduced home and 24-hour SBP by 6.6 to 8.7 mm Hg when compared with placebo in patients with resistant hypertension and eGFR < 45 mL/ min/1.73 m2; the reduction in BP was greater than with addition of doxazosin or bisoprolol, and the magnitude of reduction in 24-hour systolic and diastolic BP was greater with spironolactone than clonidine in a separate clinical trial. Nevertheless, 4% to 40% of adults with resistant hypertension cannot tolerate spironolactone due to hyperkalemia or antiandrogenic side effects. For eplerenone, RCTs have not demonstrated reduction of home BP or 24-hour BP at doses between 25 and 100 mg daily when compared with placebo, and effective treatment may require higher dosages; use of nonsteroidal MRA for treating resistant hypertension in patients with moderate to advanced CKD has not been tested in a clinical trial but may be considered in selected patients with close monitoring of serum potassium.

### Management of hyperkalemia during treatment with mineralocorticoid receptor blockers: findings from esaxerenone [^111Fa4pA]. Hypertension Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Monitoring

In the general patient population, potassium levels are often elevated. Approximately 6.8% of the Japanese population is estimated to have hyperkalemia (defined as at least two serum potassium readings ≥ 5.1 mEq/L) based on the results of a medical database analysis. Similarly, a Swedish study examining 364,955 patients who accessed healthcare over a 3-year period revealed a 7% incidence of hyperkalemia (defined as potassium > 5 mEq/L) with a 35.7% rate of recurrence.

Regular monitoring allows drug dosages to be adjusted based on serum potassium levels. A long-term potassium monitoring study in patients with heart failure suggested that maintenance of serum potassium levels within the normal range should be considered a therapeutic target, allowing clinicians to modify treatment and mitigate risks to improve clinical outcomes for patients. In patients with diabetes being treated with an ACE inhibitor, ARB, or spironolactone, compared with no monitoring, regular monitoring of serum potassium has been shown to decrease the risk of hyperkalemia-related adverse events (adjusted relative risk 0.5, 95% CI 0.37–0.66). According to the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative, the suggested frequency of serum potassium monitoring after initiation of ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy is as follows: every 4–12 weeks for serum potassium ≤ 4.5 mEq/L, every 2–4 weeks for 4.6–5 mEq/L, and more frequently than every 2 weeks for > 5 mEq/L. The American Heart Association states that potassium levels and renal function should typically be checked on days 3 and 7 after initiating therapy with aldosterone antagonists and then at least monthly for the first 3 months. However, the frequency of serum potassium measurement is not described in the guidelines published by the Japanese Society of Nephrology or Japanese societies related to CVD.

To avoid the risk of false positive findings, serum potassium levels need to be measured carefully. Causes of false positives include hemolysis, delay in sample processing, long-term cold storage, and contamination of blood samples with antiseptics or potassium salts from blood collection tubes. Careful collection techniques and proper sample handling and storage are therefore essential.

Additional suggestions for clinicians intending to prescribe RAASis include pretreatment GFR and baseline serum potassium determination (to identify or exclude high-risk patients), dosage titration, and discontinuation of potassium supplements or concomitant maintenance treatment with loop or thiazide diuretics.

Secondary clinical outcomes

There were no significant differences between groups for any of the individual components of the primary endpoint, including hospitalization (HR = 0.99, 95% CI: 0.64–1.53, P = 0.970), CVD (HR = 1.14, 95% CI: 0.80–1.61, P = 0.478) or death (HR = 1.09, 95% CI: 0.70–1.70, P = 0.699; Table 2). In total, 6.0% of participants died, including 42 (6.2%) deaths among the intervention group and 38 (5.5%) among those randomized to usual care.

Among participants randomized to spironolactone compared to usual care, there was a small reduction in mean eGFR over follow-up at 3 years (adjusted treatment effect −1.14 mL min −1 1.73 m −2, 95% CI: −1.92 to −0.37, P = 0.004; Table 3). A modest deterioration in mean eGFR was observed in the spironolactone arm at 6 months to 42 mL min −1 1.73 m −2, which then remained stable at 1, 2 and 3 years. The mean eGFR in the control group was stable for up to 2 years and then a small decline to 42 mL min −1 1.73 m −2 at year 3. Although small differences, these slightly lower mean eGFRs in the spironolactone participants were statistically significant at each follow-up time point (Table 3). Among those randomized to spironolactone, the adjusted treatment effects for eGFR at 6 months, 1 year, 2 years and 3 years, respectively, were −1.68 mL min −1 1.73 m −2 (95% CI: −2.41 to −0.94), −2.33 mL min −1 1.73 m −2 (95% CI: −3.08 to −1.58), −0.89 mL min −1 1.73 m −2 (95% CI: −1.69 to −0.09) and −1.14 mL min −1 1.73 m −2 (95% CI: −1.92 to −0.37; Table 3).

GLP1-RAs reduce ASCVD events, for which patients with CKD are at high risk, but these agents have not been approved to slow CKD progression.

The non-steroidal MRA finerenone reduced CKD progression and cardiovascular events (predominantly HF) in people with T2D and UACR ≥ 30 mg/g when added to standard of care, including a RAS inhibitor. Hyperkalemia occurred at higher rates with finerenone than placebo, but 99% of patients completed the trials. – Finerenone can be added to standard of care treatment (including a RAS inhibitor and SGLT2 inhibitor) for people with T2D and CKD.

2.3.5. Management of Comorbid Heart Failure and CKD

HF and CKD frequently intersect in clinical practice and have unique diagnostic, management, and monitoring considerations. Patients with comorbid HF and CKD face markedly elevated risks of clinical progression and mortality yet are often inadequately treated with disease-modifying therapies targeting each condition ("a risk-treatment parado").

Guideline-recommended HF therapies have been studied across a broad range of patients with comorbid CKD. The SGLT2 inhibitors have been studied and demonstrated to be safe and well-tolerated in patients with HF at eGFRs as low as 20 mL/min/1.73 m 2. Other therapeutic classes, including ACE inhibitors, ARBs, ARNI, and steroidal MRAs (spironolactone and eplerenone) have been mostly studied at eGFR as low as 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2. Although limited evidence exists for use of beta-blockers among those who require kidney-replacement therapy, no overt safety risks have been identified, and their use in those with HF may be considered.

### Clinical benefit of spironolactone in patients with acute decompensated heart failure and severe renal dysfunction: data from the Korean heart failure registry [^117HCWrt]. American Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Backgrounds

We investigated the relationship between spironolactone use and all-cause mortality in acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) patients with severe renal dysfunction. The clinical benefit of spironolactone in the treatment of heart failure (HF) has been described in several large randomized clinical trials. However, its clinical benefits have not been studied in hospitalized ADHF patients with severe renal dysfunction (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] < 45 mL/min per 1.73 m(2)).

Methods and Results

We retrospectively analyzed data from the Korean Heart Failure Registry. We included 1,035 ADHF patients with severe renal dysfunction. In Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, all-cause mortality in the spironolactone-treated group was significantly lower than that in the nonspironolactone group (18.1% vs 24.9%, respectively, log rank P = 0.028). However, spironolactone use was not an independent predictor after adjusting other HF risk factors (hazard ratio 0.974, 95% CI 0.681–1.392, P = 0.884) and after propensity score matching (P = 0.115). In subgroup analysis, the clinical benefit of spironolactone use was preserved in women, prehospital spironolactone use, the chronic kidney disease stage 3b (eGFR 30–44 mL/min per 1.73 m(2)), and the appropriate spironolactone use (eGFR ≥ 30 mL/min per 1.73 m(2) and K ≤ 5.0 mmol/L).

Conclusion

The spironolactone therapy was not beneficial in ADHF patients with severe renal dysfunction after multivariable adjusting and propensity score matching. However, we reassured the current HF guidelines for spironolactone use and the clinical benefit in chronic kidney disease stage 3b should be assessed in future clinical trial.

### Concerns regarding renal function claims in low-dose spironolactone study [^117SySqk]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

We read with interest the study by Amini et al. on low‐dose spironolactone in diabetic kidney disease. While we appreciate the authors' investigation of safety at reduced dosing, we believe some aspects of their eGFR interpretation need clarification from a nephrology perspective.

The authors report a statistically significant increase in eGFR from 71.83 ± 19.09 to 74.25 ± 17.81 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (p = 0.042) and describe this as renal function improvement. This interpretation warrants careful consideration:

First, creatinine measurement has inherent analytical variability, and small changes in calculated eGFR may not reflect true kidney function changes. The magnitude of change (3.4%) falls within the expected coefficient of variation for creatinine‐based eGFR calculations. A systematic review and meta‐analysis of 37 studies with 2770 participants demonstrate that eGFR fluctuations of 5.0%–5.2% likely represent analytical noise rather than clinically meaningful change. Such small variations should be interpreted cautiously without confirmatory measurements.

Second, we note that the concurrent decrease in serum creatinine (1.08 ± 0.23 to 1.01 ± 0.23 mg/dL) is difficult to explain mechanistically, as spironolactone does not enhance creatinine clearance or reduce creatinine generation. Furthermore, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists characteristically reduce GFR through hemodynamic effects, including afferent arteriole vasoconstriction and decreased glomerular filtration pressure. An increase in eGFR contradicts established pharmacological mechanisms.

Third, previous studies with identical 12.5 mg spironolactone dosing have consistently shown stable or slightly decreased eGFR, not increases. For example, Oiwa et al.'s multicenter randomised controlled trial demonstrated that eGFR remained stable from 64.2 ± 17.6 to 60.2 ± 16.1 mL/min/1.73 m 2 in the spironolactone group while achieving significant albuminuria reduction. This rigorous randomised controlled trial design with proper control group provides higher‐quality evidence than the current pre‐post intervention study. The present findings are inconsistent with this established pattern from controlled trials.

### Effects of spironolactone on exercise blood pressure in patients at increased risk of developing heart failure: report from the HOMAGE trial [^114aTJ1G]. Hypertension Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In patients at increased risk of developing HF, MRA by spironolactone reduced the pre- and post-exercise BP but did not result in significant increases in exercise capacity or QoL. Guidelines for the management of symptomatic HF (stages III-IV) unanimously recommend the use of MRAs giving the overwhelming evidence from randomized clinical trials. Given the current results, use of spironolactone 25–50 mg/day may also be considered in the management of patients at increased risk of developing HF, because of coronary heart disease; its use is not limited by hyperkalemia or an excessive reduction in eGFR.

### Patiromer to enable spironolactone use in the treatment of patients with resistant hypertension and chronic kidney disease: rationale and design of the AMBER study [^117EEe1H]. American Journal of Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

While chronic kidney disease (CKD) is common in resistant hypertension (RHTN), prior studies -evaluating mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists excluded patients with reduced kidney function due to risk of hyperkalemia. AMBER (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT03071263) will evaluate if the potassium-binding polymer patiromer used concomitantly with spironolactone in patients with RHTN and CKD prevents hyperkalemia and allows more persistent spironolactone use for hypertension management.

Methods

Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel group 12-week study of patiromer and spironolactone versus placebo and spironolactone in patients with uncontrolled RHTN and CKD. RHTN is defined as unattended systolic automated office blood pressure (AOBP) of -135–160 mm Hg during screening despite taking ≥ 3 antihypertensives, including a diuretic, and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker -(unless not tolerated or contraindicated). The CKD inclusion criterion is an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 25 to ≤ 45 mL/min/1.73 m2. Screening serum potassium must be 4.3–5.1 mEq/L. The primary efficacy endpoint is the between-group difference (spironolactone plus patiromer versus spironolactone plus placebo) in the proportion of patients remaining on spironolactone at Week 12.

Results

Baseline characteristics have been analyzed as of March 2018 for 146 (of a targeted 290) patients. Mean (SD) baseline age is 69.3 (10.9) years; 52.1% are male, 99.3% White, and 47.3% have diabetes. Mean (SD) baseline serum potassium is 4.68 (0.25) mEq/L, systolic AOBP is 144.3 (6.8) mm Hg, eGFR is 35.7 (7.7) mL/min/1.73 m2.

Conclusion

AMBER will define the ability of patiromer to facilitate the use of spironolactone, an effective antihypertensive therapy for patients with RHTN and CKD.

### Low-dose spironolactone and cardiovascular outcomes in moderate stage chronic kidney disease: a randomized controlled trial [^1138uhNq]. Nature Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with a substantial risk of progression to end-stage renal disease and vascular events. The nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA), finerenone, offers cardiorenal protection for people with CKD and diabetes, but there is uncertainty if the steroidal MRA, spironolactone, provides the same protection. In this prospective, randomized, open, blinded endpoint trial, we assessed the effectiveness of 25 mg spironolactone in addition to usual care or usual care alone for reducing cardiovascular outcomes in stage 3b CKD among an older community cohort (mean age = 74.8 years and s.d. = 8.1). We recruited 1,434 adults from English primary care, of whom 1,372 (96%) were included in the primary analysis. The primary outcome was time from randomization until the first occurrence of death, hospitalization for heart disease, stroke, heart failure, transient ischemic attack or peripheral arterial disease, or first onset of any condition listed not present at baseline. Across 3 years of follow-up, the primary endpoint occurred in 113 of 677 participants randomized to spironolactone (16.7%) and 111 of 695 participants randomized to usual care (16.0%) with no significant difference between groups (hazard ratio = 1.05, 95% confidence interval: 0.81–1.37). Two-thirds of participants randomized to spironolactone stopped treatment within 6 months, predominantly because they met prespecified safety stop criteria. The most common reason for stopping spironolactone was a decrease in the estimated glomerular filtration rate that met prespecified stop criteria (n = 239, 35.4%), followed by participants being withdrawn due to treatment side effects (n = 128, 18.9%) and hyperkalemia (n = 54, 8.0%). In conclusion, we found that spironolactone was frequently discontinued due to safety concerns, with no evidence that it reduced cardiovascular outcomes in people with stage 3b CKD. Spironolactone should not be used for people with stage 3b CKD without another explicit treatment indication. ClinicalTrials.gov registration:

### Spironolactone and outcomes in older patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction [^111vc4zd]. The American Journal of Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The efficacy of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists or aldosterone antagonists in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) is well known. Less is known about their effectiveness in real-world older patients with HFrEF.

Methods

Of the 8206 patients with heart failure and ejection fraction ≤ 35% without prior spironolactone use in the Medicare-linked OPTIMIZE-HF registry, 6986 were eligible for spironolactone therapy based on serum creatinine criteria (men ≤ 2.5 mg/dL, women ≤ 2.0 mg/dL) and 865 received a discharge prescription for spironolactone. Using propensity scores for spironolactone use, we assembled a matched cohort of 1724 (862 pairs) patients receiving and not receiving spironolactone, balanced on 58 baseline characteristics (Creatinine Cohort: mean age, 75 years, 42% women, 17% African American). We repeated the above process to assemble a secondary matched cohort of 1638 (819 pairs) patients with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (eGFR Cohort: mean age, 75 years, 42% women, 17% African American).

Results

In the matched Creatinine Cohort, spironolactone-associated hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) for all-cause mortality, heart failure readmission, and combined endpoint of heart failure readmission or all-cause mortality were 0.92 (0.81–1.03), 0.87 (0.77–0.99), and 0.87 (0.79–0.97), respectively. Respective hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) in the matched eGFR Cohort were 0.87 (0.77–0.98), 0.92 (0.80–1.05), and 0.91 (0.82–1.02).

Conclusions

These findings provide evidence of consistent, albeit modest, clinical effectiveness of spironolactone in older patients with HFrEF regardless of renal eligibility criteria used. Additional strategies are needed to improve the effectiveness of aldosterone antagonists in clinical practice.

### Spironolactone add-on for preventing or slowing the progression of diabetic nephropathy: a meta-analysis [^115XLvfe]. Clinical Therapeutics (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

The aim of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the benefits and potential adverse effects of adding spironolactone to standard antidiabetic/renoprotective/antihypertensive (AD/RP/AHT) treatment in patients with diabetic nephropathy (DN).

Methods

PubMed/MEDLINE and Web of Knowledge were searched for relevant randomized, controlled studies (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs of the effects of adding spironolactone to standard AD/RP/AHT treatment in patients with DN. Results were summarized with a random-effects model or a fixed-effects model.

Findings

According to the outcomes measured (benefits and risks of adding spironolactone to standard AD/RP/AHT treatment), compared with controls, the addition of spironolactone significantly decreased end-of-treatment (EOT) 24-hour urinary albumin/protein excretion and significantly increased percentage reduction from baseline in urinary albumin/creatinine ratio (UACR), although it did not significantly affect EOT UACR. The addition of spironolactone further led to a significantly greater reduction from baseline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR)/estimated (e) GFR, although it did not significantly affect EOT GFR/eGFR. Further, the addition of spironolactone significantly reduced EOT in-office, 24-hour, and daytime systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP, respectively) and led to significantly greater reductions from baseline in in-office SBP and DBP, although it did not significantly affect nighttime SBP or DBP. Finally, the addition of spironolactone significantly increased mean serum/plasma potassium levels and the risk for hyperkalemia.

Implications

Spironolactone could be added to preexisting AD/RP/AHT therapy in patients with DN to prevent or slow DN progression by reducing proteinuria. The addition of spironolactone would likely provide even more beneficial effect in patients with DN and hypertension due to the BP reduction associated with spironolactone use. However, the beneficial effects of spironolactone add-on should be weighed against its potential risks, especially hyperkalemia. The long-term effects of spironolactone add-on on renal outcomes and mortality need to be studied.

Resistant hypertension — spironolactone add-on therapy: For patients with resistant hypertension (defined as those who are not adequately controlled with maximally tolerated dose of triple therapy [i.e., a thiazide-type diuretic, calcium channel blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker]), we suggest adding spironolactone in those patients without contraindications (Weak for | Reviewed, New-replaced). The mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist spironolactone more effectively reduced SBP and DBP compared to placebo when added as the fourth agent to the treatment regimen of patients with resistant HTN, and in patients with a history of hyperkalemia and diminished renal function, spironolactone should be used cautiously and with frequent monitoring of potassium and renal function.

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Aldosterone antagonist therapy — hyperkalemia risk minimization: Impaired renal function is a risk factor for hyperkalemia during treatment with aldosterone antagonists, and risk increases when serum creatinine exceeds 1.6 mg per dL; in patients in whom creatinine may not reflect filtration, determination that glomerular filtration rate or creatinine clearance exceeds 30 mL per min is recommended. Aldosterone antagonists should not be administered to patients with baseline serum potassium in excess of 5.0 mEq per liter. An initial dose of spironolactone 12.5 mg or eplerenone 25 mg is recommended, with possible increase to spironolactone 25 mg or eplerenone 50 mg as appropriate. The risk of hyperkalemia is increased with concomitant higher doses of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) (captopril greater than or equal to 75 mg daily; enalapril or lisinopril greater than or equal to 10 mg daily); nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitors should be avoided, and potassium supplements should be discontinued or reduced. Close monitoring is required: potassium levels and renal function should be checked in 3 days and at 1 week after initiation of therapy and at least monthly for the first 3 months, and diarrhea or other causes of dehydration should be addressed emergently. Although trial entry allowed creatinine greater than 2.5 mg per dL, in 1 trial 95% of patients had creatinine less than or equal to 1.7 mg per dL, indicating most studied patients had better renal function than the entry limit.

Hospitalized HFrEF — low blood pressure and renal function considerations with GDMT: In CHAMP-HF, few patients with SBP < 110 mm Hg achieved target doses of therapies, specifically beta blockers (17.5%), ACEi-ARB (6.2%), or ARNi (1.8%); in PARADIGM-HF, patients with lower SBP on sacubitril-valsartan had the same tolerance and relative benefit over enalapril as those with higher SBP; SENIORS reported nebivolol had equivalent tolerance and benefits irrespective of SBP; in Val-HeFT, decreases in SBP did not offset the beneficial effects of valsartan on HF morbidity; small to moderate renal function worsening defined as ≥ 20% decrease in eGFR was not associated with AKI, and spironolactone and beta blockers might be protective; in OPTIMIZE-HF, discharge use of carvedilol was associated with a reduction in 60- to 90-day mortality and composite risk of mortality.

### Resistant hypertension: diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment a clinical consensus statement from the Thai hypertension society [^117DfjMN]. Hypertension Research (2024). Medium credibility.

In patients with RH, the fourth medication should include a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA), specifically spironolactone, based on the PATHWAY-2 clinical trial. Spironolactone (25–50 mg/day) should be used cautiously in patients with an eGFR < 45 ml/min/1.73 m 2 and a plasma potassium > 4.5 mmol/l. We recommend adding spironolactone or eplerenone only in patients with RH and eGFR ≥ 30 ml/min/1.73 m 2. If not previously used, chlorthalidone should be added in patients with RH and eGFR 15–30 ml/min/1.73 m 2 (Fig. 3).

Spironolactone carries a significant risk of hyperkalemia, especially in patients with CKD, particularly if the drug is added to a treatment regimen that usually includes a RAS blocking agent. It is necessary to closely monitor plasma potassium and renal function within 8 weeks after treatment initiation. Not all patients will tolerate spironolactone well due to its antiandrogenic adverse effects, resulting in gynecomastia, breast tenderness, and sexual impotence in men, and its progestogenic effect, resulting in menstrual irregularities in women. An alternative drug is amiloride at a high dosage (10–20 mg per day), which is as effective as spironolactone (25–50 mg per day). However, this drug is not available in the Thai market. If spironolactone is not tolerated or contraindicated, chlorthalidone can be considered, even in patients with eGFR ≥ 30 ml/min/1.73 m 2, but previously used diuretic must be discontinued first.

### Low-dose spironolactone and cardiovascular outcomes in moderate stage chronic kidney disease: a randomized controlled trial [^115Gkirr]. Nature Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

In this randomized PROBE trial, we found that low-dose spironolactone did not reduce the risk of a composite outcome of death, hospitalization for CVD or new cardiovascular events compared to usual care among a community cohort of people (mean age = 74.8 years) with moderate CKD and a high burden of cardiovascular comorbidity. We also found no reduction in risk in any component of the composite outcome nor in our prespecified subgroups of participants with coronary artery disease, type 2 diabetes or uncontrolled hypertension at baseline. In the within-trial economic analysis, spironolactone was not effective compared to usual care. Although difficulties with recruitment left the study underpowered, based on the anticipated effect size, this is unlikely to have influenced the outcomes. The conditional power calculation suggests that there is an 11.8% probability that a statistically significant result would have been found if the trial had reached its recruited target and the observed event rate remained constant with the participants who were recruited. Spironolactone appeared to be poorly tolerated among the study population, and only a third of participants continued on treatment beyond 6 months post-randomization. Participants randomized to spironolactone did have a small but statistically significant greater deterioration in eGFR across follow-up. These participants were also more likely to have hyperkalemia and hypotension. Our results suggest that spironolactone should not be used in people with CKD without another specific indication, such as heart failure.

Selection of antihypertensive agents in resistant hypertension

According to American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) 2017, International Society of Hypertension (ISH) 2020 and European Society of Hypertension (ESH) 2023 Guidelines, the preferred antihypertensive drug treatment of resistant hypertension should at least include the following antihypertensive classes: angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker, calcium antagonist (= calcium channel blocker), and thiazide diuretics. The steps recommended to apply if triple therapy (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker, calcium channel blocker, and diuretic) fails to achieve optimal BP are the following (Figure 1):

Figure 1.
Assessment of apparent and true resistant hypertension. Abbreviations: ACEi, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor; ARB, angiotensin receptor blocker; BP, blood pressure; CCB, calcium channel blocker; eGFR, estimated glomerular filtration rate; HT, hypertension; T/TL, thiazide/thiazide-like.

- To optimize and tailor the current treatment regimen based on individual risk factors including health behavior changes.
- Use of thiazide-like rather than thiazide diuretics, and initiation of loop diuretics for estimated glomerular filtration rate < 30 ml/min/1.73 m 2 or clinical volume overload.
- Add a low dose of spironolactone as the 4th line agent in patients whose serum potassium is < 4.5 mmol/l and whose estimated glomerular filtration rate is > 45 ml/min/1.73m 2 to achieve BP targets.
- If spironolactone is contraindicated or not tolerated, amiloride, beta-blocker, clonidine, doxazosin, and eplerenone are alternatives, or any available antihypertensive class not already in use.

2.1 General Considerations

Spironolactone oral suspension is not therapeutically equivalent to Aldactone. Follow dosing instructions given here. In patients requiring a dose greater than 100 mg, use another formulation. Doses of the suspension greater than 100 mg may result in spironolactone concentrations higher than expected [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Spironolactone oral suspension can be taken with or without food, but should be taken consistently with respect to food [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

2.2 Treatment of Heart Failure

In patients with serum potassium ≤ 5.0 mEq/L and eGFR > 50 mL/min/1.73m2, initiate treatment at 20 mg (4 mL) once daily. Patients who tolerate 20 mg (4 mL) once daily may have their dosage increased to 37.5 mg (7.5 mL) once daily as clinically indicated. Patients who develop hyperkalemia on 20 mg (4 mL) once daily may have their dosage reduced to 20 mg (4 mL) every other day [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. In patients with an eGFR between 30 and 50 mL/min/1.73m2, consider initiating treatment at 10 mg (2 mL) because of the risk of hyperkalemia [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

2.3 Treatment of Essential Hypertension

The recommended initial daily dose is 20 mg (4 mL) to 75 mg (15 mL) administered in either single or divided doses. Dosage can be titrated at two-week intervals. Doses > 75 mg/day generally do not provide additional reductions in blood pressure.

2.4 Treatment of Edema Associated with Hepatic Cirrhosis

In patients with cirrhosis, initiate therapy in a hospital setting and titrate slowly [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The recommended initial daily dose is 75 mg (15 mL) administered in either single or divided doses. In patients requiring titration above 100 mg, use another formulation [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. When given as the sole agent for diuresis, administer for at least five days before increasing dose to obtain desired effect.

Safety

In total, 455 participants randomized to spironolactone had treatment withdrawn because of safety concerns. The most common reason (n = 239, 35.4%) was a decrease in eGFR that met the prespecified stop criteria, followed by 128 (18.9%) participants being withdrawn due to potential treatment side effects.

The frequency of adverse events is shown in Table 4 (with classification by Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) codes shown in Supplementary Table 1). An additional 33 participants who were randomized to spironolactone but who did not take any medication were included in the comparator usual care arm in this analysis. There were significantly more episodes of hypotension (systolic blood pressure < 100 mm Hg or a drop in the systolic pressure of > 20 mm Hg on standing) experienced across all individuals in the spironolactone versus the control arm (49 versus 32, adjusted treatment effect 1.6 (95% CI: 1.04–2.46), P = 0.034), with 11 participants citing hypotension as a reason for withdrawal from treatment (Tables 3 and 4). Participants who received spironolactone experienced significantly more episodes of hyperkalemia (24.7%) overall versus 13.4% in the control arm, defined by a potassium of ≥ 5.5 mmol l −1. Most of these were mild (potassium 5.5–5.9 mmol l −1) in both arms, but 11% of the raised potassium events that occurred were levels of ≥ 6 mmol l −1 and therefore required dose suspension or adjustment, and 8.0% (n = 54) of participants were withdrawn from spironolactone treatment for reasons related to hyperkalemia. Among patients who experienced hyperkalemia, the mean baseline eGFR was 41.9 mL min − 1 1.73 m −2 (s.d. 7.08) compared to a mean baseline eGFR of 43.9 mL min − 1 1.73 m −2 (s.d. 6.92) among those who did not experience hyperkalemia.

2.3.1 Use of finerenone

Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) like spironolactone and eplerenone have been demonstrated to improve blood pressure control, reduce proteinuria and slow progression of CKD and reduce mortality in heart failure. However, their use is limited by their propensity to cause hyperkalaemia in people with CKD, especially those with diabetes. Finerenone is a non‐steroidal, selective MRA with greater mineralocorticoid receptor affinity and selectivity, and as such its use is associated with less hyperkalaemia and minimal gynaecomastia compared with the steroidal MRAs.

Based on the strong evidence of cardio‐renal protection offered by the addition of finerenone in the FIDELIO‐CKD and FIGARO‐CKD studies, we suggest in people with CKD who have persistent albuminuria (ACR > 30 mg/mmol) despite the use of maximum tolerated doses of RASi and SGLT2i, to consider addition of finerenone to reduce the risk of adverse kidney and cardiovascular outcomes. Finerenone can be used if eGFR is more than or equal to 25 mL/min/1.73m 2 and serum potassium is normal (< 5 mmol/L). Finerenone can also be used as a second line drug in addition to ACE inhibitor or ARB if SGLT2i is not tolerated. It is important to monitor serum potassium level after commencing treatment and the dose of finerenone adjusted accordingly.

2.3.2 Use of‐1 receptor agonists (‐1)

At present, one primary kidney end point study reported with GLP‐1 RAwhich demonstrated kidney benefits and CVD mortality benefits with the use of semaglutide on top of RASi as compared to standard of care (RASi‐only). In this trial, ~15.6% of the cohort were on SGLT‐2 inhibitors at baseline and no major heterogeneity of treatment effect or results were observed in those on this combination. GLP‐1 RA also have robust data in people with type 2 diabetes with multiple clinical trials demonstrating CVD benefits in those at risk of CVD or with established CVD. The available limited data from recent studies and real‐world data suggest potential complementary and additive effects and in our opinion combination treatment GLP‐1 RA and SGLT‐2 inhibitors should also be considered early in the management people with T2D and CKD to address residual cardio‐renal risk (Tiers 1 or 2).

### Low-dose spironolactone and cardiovascular outcomes in moderate stage chronic kidney disease: a randomized controlled trial [^117EGZ6d]. Nature Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

Because of the design of the current trial, recent large randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that SGLT2 inhibitors can slow CKD progression and death from renal or cardiovascular causes among people with CKD, with or without type 2 diabetes –. The SGLT2 inhibitor trial findings have informed updates in guideline recommendations and are likely to substantially change the management of patients with CKD in practice. However, SGLT2 inhibitors were used infrequently in primary care during the BARACK-D study period, with only four of our participants prescribed these treatments. This is in line with an observational study reporting that 11% of patients with type 2 diabetes were prescribed an SGLT2 inhibitor in 2019. These data indicate that we can be confident that our results were not affected by SGLT2 inhibitor prescribing.

Our study was a large, randomized primary care study that managed to recruit a sample of participants that was older and with a more equal proportion of genders than previous randomized studies of patients with CKD. Given that CKD is common with increasing age, our findings are likely to be generalizable to the populations treated with CKD in primary care settings in high-income countries.

Limitations of the study include that we recruited only around half the number of participants we originally planned (> 3,000 participants) due to difficulties with recruitment, despite over 300 GP surgeries acting as recruitment sites. This potentially risks the study being underpowered based on our original power calculations. However, no trend was seen toward a treatment effect in the primary analysis or any of its composite outcomes. Furthermore, the post hoc conditional power analysis suggests that the results would not have changed if we had recruited the planned numbers. Follow-up of participants was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly for data that could not be collected remotely, such as eGFR. Data for the primary outcome were complete for all randomized and eligible participants who completed follow-up.

Another potential limitation was that we did not use a placebo control in this study, meaning participants and their treating clinicians were unblinded to the intervention. This may have had an impact on the withdrawal and discontinuation rates, which were higher among people randomized to spironolactone, as treatment may have been stopped as a precaution or through attribution of symptoms to the intervention. Stop rules were implemented to protect participants' safety, but these did risk trial treatment being terminated for some participants with a temporary change in kidney function or potassium levels.

In addition, the recruiting physician could discontinue a participant from the study treatment at any time if it was considered necessary for any reason, including the following general rules:
Ineligibility (either arising during the study or retrospectively having been overlooked at screening).
Significant protocol deviation as judged by the trial physician.
Significant noncompliance with treatment regimen or study requirements.
An adverse event that requires discontinuation of the study medication or results in the inability to continue to comply with study procedures.
Disease progression that requires discontinuation of the study medication or results in the inability to continue to comply with study procedures.
Lost to follow-up.

Each participant also had the right to withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason.

Outcomes

The primary outcome was the time from randomization until the first occurrence of any of the following events: death, hospitalization for heart disease (coronary heart disease, arrhythmia, atrial fibrillation, sudden death or failed sudden death, defined as a cardiac arrest where the participant was successfully resuscitated), stroke, heart failure, transient ischemic attack or PAD, or first onset of any condition listed not present at baseline.

Prespecified secondary outcomes included changes in blood pressure, natriuretic peptides, ACR and eGFR recorded in the primary care record across follow-up, as well as rates of adverse events, including hyperkalemia and hypotension. Hyperkalemia was considered serum potassium of 5.5 mmol l −1 or greater, subcategorized as 5.5–5.9 mmol l −1, 6.0–6.4 mmol l −1 and ≥ 6.5 mmol l −1. Hypotension was defined as systolic blood pressure < 100 mm Hg or a drop in the systolic pressure of > 20 mm Hg on standing. Progression of kidney disease was defined as a ≥ 30% increase in creatinine from baseline, a drop of ≥ 25% in eGFR from baseline or a ≥ 20% drop in eGFR from the previous result.

An independent panel of three senior clinicians adjudicated each of the endpoints, using all the available clinical information independently of each other, with discussion determining the endpoint where there was initial disagreement.

### Aldosterone antagonists in addition to renin angiotensin system antagonists for preventing the progression of chronic kidney disease [^116SUhnT]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) is used to reduce proteinuria and retard the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, resolution of proteinuria may be incomplete with these therapies and the addition of an aldosterone antagonist may be added to further prevent progression of CKD. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2009 and updated in 2014.

Objectives

To evaluate the effects of aldosterone antagonists (selective (eplerenone), non-selective (spironolactone or canrenone), or non-steroidal mineralocorticoid antagonists (finerenone)) in adults who have CKD with proteinuria (nephrotic and non-nephrotic range) on: patient-centred endpoints including kidney failure (previously know as end-stage kidney disease (ESKD)), major cardiovascular events, and death (any cause); kidney function (proteinuria, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and doubling of serum creatinine); blood pressure; and adverse events (including hyperkalaemia, acute kidney injury, and gynaecomastia).

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 13 January 2020 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal, and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs that compared aldosterone antagonists in combination with ACEi or ARB (or both) to other anti-hypertensive strategies or placebo in participants with proteinuric CKD.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data. Data were summarised using random effects meta-analysis. We expressed summary treatment estimates as a risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes, or standardised mean difference (SMD) when different scales were used together with their 95% confidence interval (CI). Risk of bias were assessed using the Cochrane tool. Evidence certainty was evaluated using GRADE.

Main Results

Forty-four studies (5745 participants) were included. Risk of bias in the evaluated methodological domains were unclear or high risk in most studies. Adequate random sequence generation was present in 12 studies, allocation concealment in five studies, blinding of participant and investigators in 18 studies, blinding of outcome assessment in 15 studies, and complete outcome reporting in 24 studies. All studies comparing aldosterone antagonists to placebo or standard care were used in addition to an ACEi or ARB (or both). None of the studies were powered to detect differences in patient-level outcomes including kidney failure, major cardiovascular events or death. Aldosterone antagonists had uncertain effects on kidney failure (2 studies, 84 participants: RR 3.00, 95% CI 0.33 to 27.65, I² = 0%; very low certainty evidence), death (3 studies, 421 participants: RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.10 to 3.50, I² = 0%; low certainty evidence), and cardiovascular events (3 studies, 1067 participants: RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.26 to 3.56; I² = 42%; low certainty evidence) compared to placebo or standard care. Aldosterone antagonists may reduce protein excretion (14 studies, 1193 participants: SMD -0.51, 95% CI -0.82 to -0.20, I² = 82%; very low certainty evidence), eGFR (13 studies, 1165 participants, MD -3.00 mL/min/1.73 m², 95% CI -5.51 to -0.49, I² = 0%, low certainty evidence) and systolic blood pressure (14 studies, 911 participants: MD -4.98 mmHg, 95% CI -8.22 to -1.75, I² = 87%; very low certainty evidence) compared to placebo or standard care. Aldosterone antagonists probably increase the risk of hyperkalaemia (17 studies, 3001 participants: RR 2.17, 95% CI 1.47 to 3.22, I² = 0%; moderate certainty evidence), acute kidney injury (5 studies, 1446 participants: RR 2.04, 95% CI 1.05 to 3.97, I² = 0%; moderate certainty evidence), and gynaecomastia (4 studies, 281 participants: RR 5.14, 95% CI 1.14 to 23.23, I² = 0%; moderate certainty evidence) compared to placebo or standard care. Non-selective aldosterone antagonists plus ACEi or ARB had uncertain effects on protein excretion (2 studies, 139 participants: SMD -1.59, 95% CI -3.80 to 0.62, I² = 93%; very low certainty evidence) but may increase serum potassium (2 studies, 121 participants: MD 0.31 mEq/L, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.45, I² = 0%; low certainty evidence) compared to diuretics plus ACEi or ARB. Selective aldosterone antagonists may increase the risk of hyperkalaemia (2 studies, 500 participants: RR 1.62, 95% CI 0.66 to 3.95, I² = 0%; low certainty evidence) compared ACEi or ARB (or both). There were insufficient studies to perform meta-analyses for the comparison between non-selective aldosterone antagonists and calcium channel blockers, selective aldosterone antagonists plus ACEi or ARB (or both) and nitrate plus ACEi or ARB (or both), and non-steroidal mineralocorticoid antagonists and selective aldosterone antagonists.

Authors' Conclusions

The effects of aldosterone antagonists when added to ACEi or ARB (or both) on the risks of death, major cardiovascular events, and kidney failure in people with proteinuric CKD are uncertain. Aldosterone antagonists may reduce proteinuria, eGFR, and systolic blood pressure in adults who have mild to moderate CKD but may increase the risk of hyperkalaemia, acute kidney injury and gynaecomastia when added to ACEi and/or ARB.

### Incidence, predictors and clinical management of hyperkalaemia in new users of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists [^111wXj6X]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2018). Low credibility.

Characterizing MRA users at high hyperkalaemia risk is important to highlight the need for hyperkalaemia‐preventive strategies. This importance is exemplified by our finding that hyperkalaemia development was associated with a three‐fold higher risk of mortality. However, some caution is necessary when interpreting the magnitude of our observed relative risk because of reverse causation bias (i.e. patients at higher risk of dying may have undergone more healthcare explorations and consequently more hyperkalaemias may have been detected). Association does not imply causation, and we note that in the Eplerenone in Mild Patients Hospitalization and Survival Study in Heart Failure (EMPHASIS‐HF), eplerenone was superior to placebo at all K + levels 31 and in RALES, spironolactone with hyperkalaemia up to at least 5.5 mmol/L was more effective than placebo and normokalaemia. 30 Collectively, our results confirm the variety of risk factors for hyperkalaemia and emphasize the central role of the kidneys on K + balance. In addition, and alike previous studies, we found that old age, male sex, co‐morbidities (heart failure, cerebrovascular disease and diabetes) and concomitant K + ‐sparing medications are important hyperkalaemia predictors. A less explored risk factor for hyperkalaemia concerns the prescribed MRA dose. A recent analysis from RALES observed that hyperkalaemia occurred in up to 40% of participants taking spironolactone 50 mg daily, but only in 13.5% of those taking 25 mg. 32 In line with this, our study showed that MRA doses of 50 mg were more common among moderate and severe hyperkalaemias compared to mild ones. Hyperkalaemia related to spironolactone may be dose‐related, and this collectively suggest that limiting the maximum dose to 25 mg daily may reduce this risk. As a final consideration, current Food and Drug Administration and product label recommendations suggest to decrease spironolactone dose in individuals with poor kidney function. While our study cannot ascertain the reasons behind prescribed doses, we do observe a relatively weak association (weaker than it would have been anticipated) between eGFR and prescribed dose, with wide inter‐individual variation.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Resistant hypertension — initial combination therapy and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA) — Antihypertensive drug therapy should start with a combination of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), a calcium channel blocker (CCB), and a diuretic, and replacing thiazide-type diuretics with thiazide-like diuretics may offer additional BP reduction and cardiovascular protection. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have shown that the addition of spironolactone (25–50 mg/day) as the fourth drug reduced home and 24-hour systolic BP (SBP) by 6.6 to 8.7 mm Hg compared with placebo in patients with resistant hypertension and eGFR ≥ 45 mL/ min/1.73 m2, with reductions greater than with doxazosin, bisoprolol, or clonidine. Nevertheless, 4% to 40% of adults with resistant hypertension cannot tolerate spironolactone due to hyperkalemia or antiandrogenic side effects; eplerenone is a potential alternative, but RCTs have not demonstrated reduction of home BP or 24-hour BP at doses between 25 and 100 mg daily and effective treatment may require higher dosages, and nonsteroidal MRA for moderate to advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) has not been tested in a clinical trial but may be considered in selected patients with close monitoring of serum potassium.

### Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists for hypertension management in advanced chronic kidney disease: BLOCK-CKD trial [^113qGJVW]. Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

Spironolactone, a steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, is recommended as add-on therapy for treatment-resistant/uncontrolled hypertension. However, caution is advised in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) due to an increased risk for hyperkalemia. KBP-5074 is a nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist under investigation for the treatment of treatment-resistant and uncontrolled hypertension in patients with moderate-to-severe CKD. BLOCK-CKD is a phase 2, international, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of KBP-5074, on top of current therapy, in patients with stage 3B/4 CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate ≥ 15 and ≤ 44 mL/[min·1.73 m 2]) and resistant hypertension (trough cuff seated systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 mmHg, despite treatment with maximally tolerated doses of 2 or more antihypertensive medicines with complementary mechanisms). Patients (n = 240) will be randomized 1:1:1 to once-daily treatment with KBP-5074 0.25 mg, KBP-5074 0.5 mg, or placebo, stratified by estimated glomerular filtration rate (≥ 30 versus < 30 mL/[min·1.73 m 2]) and systolic blood pressure (≥ 160 versus < 160 mmHg). Approximately 30% of enrolled patients should have an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 15 to 29 mL/(min·1.73 m 2). The primary efficacy analysis is the change in trough cuff seated systolic blood pressure from baseline to day 84 for the KBP-5074 doses compared with placebo. Changes in urinary albumin-creatinine ratio will be assessed along with changes in serum potassium/incidence of hyperkalemia and changes in estimated glomerular filtration rate and serum creatinine. BLOCK-CKD will determine whether the addition of KBP-5074 will effectively lower blood pressure without an increased risk of hyperkalemia in patients who are not candidates for steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists due to advanced CKD.

Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) for HFrEF — In patients with HFrEF and NYHA class II to IV symptoms, an MRA (spironolactone or eplerenone) is recommended to reduce morbidity and mortality if eGFR is > 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 and serum potassium is < 5.0 mEq/L, with careful monitoring of potassium, renal function, and diuretic dosing at initiation and thereafter. In this population, MRA therapy provides high economic value. In patients taking MRA whose serum potassium cannot be maintained at < 5.5 mEq/L, MRA should be discontinued to avoid life-threatening hyperkalemia. MRAs show consistent improvement in all-cause mortality, HF hospitalizations, and SCD in HFrEF, and eGFR ≤ 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 or serum potassium ≥ 5.0 mEq/L are contraindications to MRA initiation.

Primary aldosteronism — choice of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist: In individuals with primary aldosteronism receiving PA-specific medical therapy, we suggest spironolactone over other mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) due to its low cost and widespread availability. The recommendation is driven by the availability and low cost of spironolactone over other MRAs; however, all MRAs, when titrated to equivalent potencies, are anticipated to have similar efficacy in treating primary aldosteronism, and MRAs with greater mineralocorticoid receptor selectivity and fewer androgen/progesterone receptor-mediated side effects may be preferred; when initiating an MRA, consider hypertension severity for dosing and potential discontinuation of other antihypertensive medications, and monitor potassium, renal function, renin (concentration or activity), and blood pressure response during follow-up to guide MRA dose titration.

### Optimal targets for blood pressure control in chronic kidney disease: the debate continues [^113pNdkq]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Because advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) is often an exclusion criterion for large randomized trials of the management of hypertension, clinical decision making for these patients has relied on a few small, specific studies and much extrapolation. Several blood pressure treatment guidelines have recently been reissued. This review explores the applicability of the revised recommendations to CKD.

Recent Findings

Many new publications are meta-analyses, guidelines and debates about guidelines. New data from trials are scant. Three revised guidelines (KDIGO, JNC8, KHA-CARI) recommend a target of less than 140/90. Most antihypertensive drugs are equally effective - but this rule may not apply to advanced CKD. Proteinuric renal disease is seen as an exception; all three guidelines set a target of 130/80 and the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (but not both) is preferred.

Summary

There is no shortage of new commentary and advice, but evidence strength and generalizability diminish as the kidneys fail and the impact of calcified vessels and salt and water overload increases. A risk-based approach to intervention may be no less valuable than targets. Clinical trials of individuals with advanced CKD will be needed to identify effective treatments and may see a resurgence of the role of spironolactone.

At 1-year follow-up, there was an initial relative reduction in systolic blood pressure among those randomized to spironolactone (adjusted treatment effect −2.66 mm Hg, 95% CI: −4.43 to −0.90, P = 0.003). However, there was no difference in systolic blood pressure between groups by the end of follow-up at 3 years (adjusted treatment effect −1.69 mm Hg, 95% CI: −3.55 to 0.16, P = 0.074; Table 3).

At 3 years, mean ACR levels had worsened in both arms from means of 4.9–10.5 mg mmol −1 and 5.3–8.2 mg mmol −1 in the spironolactone versus control arms, respectively. There was no significant difference between groups in the ACR at either time point or in a change in urine ACR over time (adjusted treatment effect 1.03 mg mmol −1, 95% CI: −1.5 to 1.59, P = 0.897; Table 3).

Considering the Safety of MRAS in Glomerular Disease

People with CKD have an increased risk of hyperkalemia, which can lead to serious issues such as cardiac arrhythmia episodes and sudden death.MRA treatments can potentially cause or worsen hyperkalemia in patients with kidney impairment, (Table 2) and is a pressing safety concern of these drugs. As per prescribing information, eplerenone is contraindicated for treating hypertension in patients with a creatinine clearance < 50 ml/min, and steroidal MRAs are not indicated for treatment of CKD with or without diabetes. A meta-analysis of data from studies of spironolactone and eplerenone has indicated that these agents conferred no significant risk of hyperkalemia in patients with nondiabetic proteinuric CKD, but this needs further investigation. The advantages of ns-MRAs include possibly lower risk of hyperkalemia (as seen with finerenone), having potency similar to spironolactone and greater than eplerenone, and greater selectivity for the MR, translating to its more specific anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic effects versus steroidal MRAs. It has been suggested that as finerenone increases potassium levels in a predictable way, patients at risk of hyperkalemia can be identified early in clinical practice and monitored for an easy management. Nonetheless, precautions are advised when prescribing finerenone. Serum potassium and eGFR should be measured in all patients before initiating treatment and should be monitored periodically during treatment, with the dose modified accordingly. Treatment should not be started if serum potassium is > 5.0 mEq/L. Finally, more frequent monitoring may be necessary for patients at risk for hyperkalemia, including those on concomitant medications that impair potassium excretion or increase serum potassium.

As noted, potassium binders such as patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate are available to manage hyperkalemia. The ongoing MorphCKD trial is exploring the feasibility of adding patiromer to allow for improved renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockade (including use of an MRA), thereby reducing albuminuria in patients with albuminuric CKD where full treatment might otherwise be limited by hyperkalemia. As noted in the KDIGO 2022 guidelines, "hyperkalemia associated with the use of an ACEi or ARB can often be managed by measures to reduce serum potassium levels rather than decreasing the dose or stopping the ACEi or ARB immediately"; these measures include a low potassium diet and the use of diuretics and potassium binders.

### Patient characteristics and initiation of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists in patients with chronic kidney disease in routine clinical practice in the US: a retrospective cohort study [^113KPi5e]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this retrospective, exploratory study is the first to describe the respective patient characteristics and use of steroidal MRAs in routine clinical practice for four distinct cohorts of patients, with CKD, DKD, CKD with HF, or DKD with HF.

Patient characteristics and use of MRAs in the CKD and MRA population studied

At least 70% of patients in the CKD population and at least 88% of patients in the MRA population reported hypertension. Steroidal MRA use was at least threefold higher in patients with HF than in those without HF, suggesting that most prescribing of steroidal MRAs was in line with current guidelines recommending their use in patients with hypertension or heart failure (New York Heart Association [NYHA] Class 3–4 and left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 35%). However, given the relatively low proportions of patients in the CKD population that were subsequently prescribed steroidal MRAs (less than 6%), our results suggest that steroidal MRA use is rare in clinical practice and are in line with other reports showing that steroidal MRA use is low even in guideline-eligible patients. Reassuringly, given the guideline recommendations for steroidal MRA use, fewer than 5% of patients in the MRA population lacked a recorded code for either hypertension or HF; this may reflect missing data rather than the absence of the condition.

Of the available steroidal MRAs, patients predominantly received spironolactone, which could be either due to lower costs or its greater effectiveness compared with eplerenone. However, fewer than half of the patients were still receiving steroidal MRA treatment one year post-initiation; it is possible that this is be linked to the incidence of adverse events such as hyperkalemia, but the exact reasons for discontinuation were not available in the database.

As might be predicted, steroidal MRA therapy was most commonly initiated by specialists, particularly nephrologists, cardiologists and other hospital specialists, irrespective of the population studied, suggesting its use often occurs later in the development of disease. This most likely reflects the recommendation of steroidal MRAs as fourth-line therapy for hypertension in the guidelines. Indeed, patients who received steroidal MRAs were more likely to be multimorbid and more advanced in chronic kidney disease, as well as having higher medication loads and healthcare costs than the overall CKD population. Interestingly, steroidal MRAs were also prescribed to a proportion of patients with stage 4 and 5 CKD, or ESRD, for which they are contra-indicated.

### Low-dose spironolactone and cardiovascular outcomes in moderate stage chronic kidney disease: a randomized controlled trial [^111vxo2a]. Nature Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

Schoenfeld residuals were conducted for the primary outcome and confirmed that the proportional hazards assumption was not violated.

Natriuretic peptide levels, eGFR, urine ACR and systolic blood pressure were each analyzed by fitting a linear mixed effects model to the data, with the endpoint measure at all available postrandomization follow-up time points as the dependent variable. The model was adjusted for randomized treatment allocation, assessment time point, baseline measurement of the respective variable of interest and interaction between randomized treatment allocation and assessment time point to allow the treatment effect to be estimated at each time point as fixed effects and a random intercept for each participant to account for the repeated measures on the same participant.

The mixed effects model is valid under the missing at random (MAR) assumption; that is, the probability of a value being missing depends on the variables included in the model. The MAR assumption was tested for natriuretic peptide levels, eGFR, urine ACR and systolic blood pressure at 3 years by analyzing each baseline covariate using a logistic regression model to determine which (if any) are associated with missingness. The respective baseline factors found to be associated with missingness were then included in the model as additional fixed effects.

The normality assumptions of the linear mixed effects model were assessed by plotting a histogram of the natriuretic peptide levels, eGFR, urine ACR and systolic blood pressure at each time point split by randomized group, a histogram of the model residuals, an inverse normal plot of the standardized model residuals and a scatter plot of the fitted values versus the model residuals.

We performed a post hoc, on-treatment analysis given the high proportion of participants in the intervention arm who had stopped spironolactone by the end of follow-up and a post hoc analysis of the outcomes censored at 3 years to explore any competing risk effects given the longer than planned mean follow-up. These were intended as exploratory analyses only, to consider whether any benefit might be conferred for participants who are able to tolerate the treatment longer-term and determine any medium-term treatment effects.

The trial failed to recruit to target. We therefore also performed a post hoc conditional power calculation to inform the likelihood of finding a significant association between spironolactone treatment and our primary outcome had the trial achieved its recruitment goal. To calculate conditional power, the remaining data for the number of participants that we had planned to recruit were simulated first based on the predicted event rates used to inform the original power calculation and then using the observed event rates from our study.

Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) therapy in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) spans trials enrolling patients with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 35%, ≤ 40%, and ≤ 30%. For spironolactone and eplerenone, the starting dose is 25 mg orally daily, increased to 50 mg daily orally after a month; for estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 31 to 49 mL/min/1.73 m2, dosing should be reduced by half, and regular checks of serum potassium and renal function are advised approximately 1 week, then 4 weeks, then every 6 months after initiating or intensifying MRA, with more frequent testing for clinical instability. Safety concerns include when eGFR is ≤ 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 and when MRA is initiated at serum potassium ≥ 5.0 mEq/L and continued ≥ 5.5 mEq/L; in trials, clinically significant hyperkalemia events were < 10% in EPHESUS and EMPHASIS-HF. Coadministration of MRA with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) mildly increases hyperkalemia risk, hyperkalemia risk was lower with angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI) in chronic heart failure but not different in decompensated heart failure when compared with ACEi, diarrhea causing dehydration or loop diuretic therapy interruption should be a consideration for temporarily holding the MRA, and the efficacy of potassium binders (for example, patiromer or sodium zirconium cyclosilicate) to facilitate continuation of MRA is uncertain.

### Effectiveness and safety of spironolactone for systolic heart failure [^117Gvevq]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

Aldosterone receptor antagonists have been shown in randomized trials to reduce morbidity and mortality in adults with symptomatic systolic heart failure. We studied the effectiveness and safety of spironolactone in adults with newly diagnosed systolic heart failure in clinical practice. We identified all adults with newly diagnosed heart failure, left ventricular ejection fraction of < 40%, and no previous spironolactone use from 2006 to 2008 in Kaiser Permanente Northern California. We excluded patients with baseline serum creatinine level of > 2.5 mg/dl or a serum potassium level of > 5.0 mEq/L. We used Cox regression with time-varying covariates to evaluate the independent association between spironolactone use and death, hospitalization, severe hyperkalemia, and acute kidney injury. Among 2,538 eligible patients with a median follow-up of 2.5 years, 521 patients (22%) initiated spironolactone, which was not associated with risk of hospitalization (adjusted hazard ratio 0.91, 95% confidence interval 0.77 to 1.08) or death (adjusted hazard ratio 0.93, confidence interval 0.60 to 1.44). Crude rates of severe hyperkalemia and acute kidney injury during spironolactone use were similar to that seen in clinical trials. Spironolactone was independently associated with a 3.5-fold increased risk of hyperkalemia but not with acute kidney injury. Within a diverse community-based cohort with incident systolic heart failure, use of spironolactone was not independently associated with risks of hospitalization or death. Our findings suggest that the benefits of spironolactone in clinical practice may be reduced compared with other guideline-recommended medications.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Heart Failure: Initiate treatment at 25 mg once daily (2.2).
Hypertension: Initiate treatment at 25 to 100 mg daily in either single or divided doses (2.3).
Edema: Initiate therapy in a hospital setting and titrate slowly. The recommended initial daily dose is 100 mg in single or divided doses (2.4).
Primary hyperaldosteronism: Initiate treatment at 100 to 400 mg in preparation for surgery. In patients unsuitable for surgery use the lowest effective dosage determined for the individual patient (2.5).

2.1	General Considerations

ALDACTONE can be taken with or without food, but should be taken consistently with respect to food [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

2.2	Treatment of Heart Failure

In patients with serum potassium ≤ 5.0 mEq/L and eGFR > 50 mL/min/1.73 m2, initiate treatment at 25 mg once daily. Patients who tolerate 25 mg once daily may have their dosage increased to 50 mg once daily as clinically indicated. Patients who develop hyperkalemia on 25 mg once daily may have their dosage reduced to 25 mg every other day [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. In patients with an eGFR between 30 and 50 mL/min/1.73 m2, consider initiating therapy at 25 mg every other day because of the risk of hyperkalemia [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

2.3	Treatment of Essential Hypertension

The recommended initial daily dose is 25 to 100 mg of ALDACTONE administered in either single or divided doses is recommended. Dosage can be titrated at two-week intervals. Doses greater than 100 mg/day generally do not provide additional reductions in blood pressure.

2.4	Treatment of Edema

In patients with cirrhosis, initiate therapy in a hospital setting and titrate slowly [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. The recommended initial daily dosage is 100 mg of ALDACTONE administered in either single or divided doses, but may range from 25 to 200 mg daily. When given as the sole agent for diuresis, administer for at least five days before increasing dose to obtain desired effect.

2.5	Treatment of Primary Hyperaldosteronism

Administer ALDACTONE in doses of 100 to 400 mg daily in preparation for surgery. For patients who are considered unsuitable for surgery, ALDACTONE can be used as long-term maintenance therapy at the lowest effective dosage determined for the individual patient.

### Finerenone versus spironolactone in patients with chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes: a target trial emulation [^111YJoK3]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

The comparative effectiveness of finerenone and spironolactone in chronic kidney disease (CKD) with type 2 diabetes (T2D) remains unclear. Here we show, using a target trial emulation on global real-world data from TriNetX, outcomes among 2268 propensity score-matched adults with CKD (eGFR 15–60mL/min/1.73 m²) and T2D who initiated finerenone or spironolactone between July 2021 and September 2024. Over a median follow-up of 1.3 years, finerenone is associated with lower risks of major adverse cardiovascular events (adjust hazard ratio [aHR], 0.74; 95% CI, 0.58–0.94), major adverse kidney events (aHR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.33–0.67), all-cause mortality (aHR, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.21–0.45), and hyperkalemia (17.2% vs. 26.4%; P < 0.001) compared with spironolactone. These findings suggest potential benefits of finerenone over spironolactone in reducing mortality and cardiorenal risk among patients with CKD and T2D.

### 2018 ESC / ESH guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^1116iDo5]. European Heart Journal (2018). Medium credibility.

ESC/ESH 2018 — management of resistant hypertension: Recommended treatment is reinforcement of lifestyle measures, especially sodium reduction; addition of low-dose spironolactone to existing treatment; or, if spironolactone is intolerant, addition of further diuretic therapy with either eplerenone, amiloride, a higher-dose thiazide/thiazide-like diuretic, or a loop diuretic; or the addition of bisoprolol or doxazosin. A loop diuretic should replace thiazides/thiazide-like diuretics if the estimated glomerular filtration rate is < 30 mL/min. Spironolactone use should usually be restricted to patients with an eGFR > 45 mL/ min and a plasma potassium concentration of ≤ 4.5 mmol/L, and electrolytes and eGFR should be monitored soon after initiation and at least annually thereafter. Spironolactone intolerance includes antiandrogenic effects such as gynaecomastia (in ~6%). Amiloride (10–20 mg/day) has recently been shown to be as effective as spironolactone in reducing BP in the PATHWAY-2 study, whereas bisoprolol or doxazosin were not as effective as spironolactone but reduced BP significantly vs placebo when added to background treatment; direct vasodilators such as hydralazine or minoxidil are infrequently used because they may cause severe fluid retention and tachycardia.

Finally, triple antihypertensive drug therapy may not control BP in a number of CKD patients. Hypertension is defined as resistant to treatment when appropriate lifestyle measures and treatment with optimal or best tolerated doses of three or more drugs (a thiazide/thiazide-like diuretic, a RAS blocker and a CCB) fail to lower office BP to < 140/90 mmHg. The inadequate BP control should be confirmed by uncontrolled 24-h BP (≥ 130/80 mmHg). Evidence of adherence to therapy and exclusion of secondary causes of hypertension are required to define true resistant hypertension. In patients with true resistant hypertension, the fourth line treatment should include the mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) spironolactone, based on the evidence from the PATHWAY-2 (Spironolactone versus placebo, bisoprolol, and doxazosin to determine the optimal treatment for drug-resistant hypertension) trial and relevant meta-analyses. However, patients with an eGFR with eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 or potassium > 4.5 mmol/L were excluded from this study and, thus, the efficacy and safety of spironolactone in such individuals are not established. In the AMBER (Patiromer versus placebo to enable spironolactone use in patients with resistant hypertension and chronic kidney disease) trial that used spironolactone with addition of placebo or patiromer in patients with treatment resistant hypertension and eGFR 25 to ≤ 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2, BP was effectively reduced in both groups, but the rates of hyperkalemia (potassium ≥ 5.5 mmol/L) were about 60% and 35%, respectively, at 12 weeks. Based on the above, the 2023 ESH Guidelines have also updated the treatment algorithm for true resistant hypertension depending on underlying renal function. Use of spironolactone as a fourth antihypertensive agent in patients with CKD G3b and treatment-resistant hypertension is generally recommended only when necessary (when BP control is not achieved with addition of other agents) and should be done with caution and frequent potassium monitoring. Use of novel potassium binders is advisable to maintain serum potassium < 5.5 mmol/L. Spironolactone is not recommended in patients with CKD G4 or higher. Instead, in the recent CLICK (Chlorthalidone in Chronic Kidney Disease) randomized trial that included 160 patients with CKD G4 and resistant hypertension, the addition of chlorthalidone (mean dose 23 mg daily) on top of previous antihypertensive treatment (including a loop diuretic) was associated with 10.5 mmHg reduction in 24-h SBP; as such, the algorithm now suggests the addition of chlorthalidone for this group of patients.

2.5 Steroidal

Steroidal MRAs, such as spironolactone and eplerenone, are used to treat HFrEF and hypertension. The 2024 KDIGO guidelines also recommend steroidal MRAs for the treatment of hyperaldosteronism or refractory hypertension; however, they may cause hyperkalaemia, particularly in people with a lower GFR.

Steroidal MRAs are currently not indicated to delay the progression of CKD, and their addition to the standard of care is associated with acute declines in eGFR in people with HF. These findings are likely due to a reversible haemodynamic effect of steroidal MRAs on reducing eGFR. A Cochrane systematic review involving 44 studies and 5745 people showed that MRAs can reduce proteinuria and systolic blood pressure in people with mild‐to‐moderate CKD; however, the risk of hyperkalaemia, acute kidney injury and gynaecomastia was increased when MRAs were combined with ACEis or ARBs. Interestingly, a study of 309 people undergoing haemodialysis who initiated spironolactone without any restriction on dietary potassium intake had a reduced risk of the composite of death due to cerebrocardiovascular (CCV) events or hospitalization for CCV events compared with those who received placebo (HR 0.40 [95% CI: 0.20–0.81]). Overall, steroidal MRAs may increase the occurrence of hyperkalaemia and cause a reduction in GFR, especially in those with CKD stage IV–V. Note that this reduction in GFR is seen with many agents and is not a major reason for caution. Table 4 provides an overview of the indications for steroidal and nonsteroidal MRAs, and Table 5 presents the structural similarities and differences between these agents.

Resistant hypertension — diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment: Confirm treatment resistance with one of the following: Office BP ≥ 130/80 mm Hg and on ≥ 3 antihypertensives with Combination of ACEi or ARB + CCB + thiazide-like diuretics preferred, or Office BP < 130/80 mm Hg but requires ≥ 4 antihypertensives with Combination of ACEi or ARB + CCB + thiazide-like diuretics preferred. Exclude pseudoresistance by ensuring accurate office BP measurements, assessing for medication nonadherence with prescribed regimen, and obtaining home, work, or ambulatory BP readings to exclude white-coat effect. Then identify and reverse contributing lifestyle factors, discontinue or minimize interfering substances, and screen for secondary causes of hypertension. Pharmacological treatment includes maximizing diuretic therapy; replacing thiazide-type diuretics with chlorthalidone 12.5–25 mg qd or indapamide 1.25–2.5 mg qd; adding spironolactone (25–50 mg qd) or equivalent dosage of eplerenone (25–50 mg BID) if eGFR ≥ 45; using chlorthalidone or loop diuretics in patients with CKD stage 4 or greater; adding agents with different mechanisms of action (MOA) such as BB, central sympatholytic drugs, or nondihydropyridine CCB for elevated heart rate; and adding potent vasodilators, for example aprocitentan, hydralazine, or minoxidil only if already on BB (or bradycardic) and loop diuretic.

### Concerns regarding renal function claims in low-dose spironolactone study [^1174zQFY]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Finally, recent evidence from the FIDELITY pooled analysis of finerenone trials demonstrates that cardiovascular and kidney benefits were maintained regardless of acute eGFR changes at month 1, with similar efficacy across patients experiencing > 10% eGFR decline, stable eGFR, or eGFR increases, confirming that early eGFR changes do not correlate with long‐term hard outcomes. We suggest focusing on clinically meaningful endpoints rather than over‐interpreting short‐term eGFR fluctuations.

We recommend the authors consider adopting more conservative language regarding renal function changes and acknowledge the limitations of short‐term eGFR monitoring. Future studies would benefit from incorporating confirmatory measurements, longer follow‐up periods and mechanistic assessments to better characterise true renal function changes with low‐dose spironolactone therapy.

Power calculations

We determined that a sample size of 1,511 participants per group (3,022 total) would be required at 80% power to detect a 20% relative risk reduction in death or cardiovascular events over 3 years of follow-up, accounting for an anticipated treatment withdrawal rate of 13%. We chose to power the trial conservatively on a 20% risk reduction because this proposed treatment effect was around half the risk reduction observed in a trial of the aldosterone receptor antagonist, eplerenone, in patients with mild heart failure.

Statistical analysis

We performed an intention-to-treat analysis, including all participants who had undergone randomization except for those who were found to be ineligible for participation postrandomization. For the primary outcome, we report the HR and 95% CI for the time to the first occurrence of a primary endpoint event using a Cox proportional hazards model adjusted for randomized treatment allocation. The safety analysis included all participants who had actually received the treatment versus the total number of people receiving usual care.

We report the frequency and percentage of the proportion of participants that reached the primary endpoint, the time at risk in days and the incidence rate per 100 years at risk. A Kaplan–Meier curve is used to compare the time to the first occurrence of a primary endpoint event between intervention groups. These analyses are repeated for each individual component of the primary endpoint (hospitalization, CVD and death).

### When to use spironolactone, eplerenone or finerenone in the spectrum of cardiorenal diseases [^112VYsL6]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

Kidney disease frequently coexists with cardiovascular (CV) diseases, and this dual presence significantly amplifies the risk of adverse clinical outcomes. Shared pathophysiological mechanisms and common CV risk factors contribute to the increased expression of mineralocorticoid receptors, which in turn can drive the progression of chronic CV-kidney disorders. The steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) spironolactone and eplerenone have demonstrated efficacy in improving patient outcomes in cases of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction or after a myocardial infarction, but have limited value in patients with chronic kidney disease. The non-steroidal MRA finerenone has now established itself as a foundational guideline-recommended therapy in patients with diabetic kidney disease. To date, these pharmacological agents have been developed in distinct patient populations. The consequences of their distinct pharmacological profiles necessitate further consideration. They have not undergone testing across the entire spectrum of cardiorenal scenarios, and the evidence base is currently being complemented with ongoing trials. In this review, we aim to synthesize the existing body of evidence and chart the future trajectory for the use of spironolactone, eplerenone and finerenone in improving clinical outcomes across the diverse spectrum of cardiorenal diseases. By consolidating the current state of knowledge, we seek to provide valuable insights for informed decision making in the management of patients with these complex and interconnected conditions.

‐intervention, study visits and follow‐up

Patients are randomized 1:1 to open‐label MRA (either spironolactone or eplerenone) plus usual care versus usual care alone. Patients randomized to MRA receive a prescription to be filled and paid for out of pocket. (In both Sweden and the US, spironolactone can be obtained for approximately 10 US cents per day. In Sweden, patients pay out‐of‐pocket for prescription medications up to an annual maximum of approximately 250 Euro, after which additional medication costs are covered by the government). Spironolactone is more potent than eplerenone, but the initial dose in guidelines and clinical practice is generally 25 mg/day for both drugs and is the dose recommended in SPIRRIT‐HFpEF. A dose of 25 mg every other day or 25 mg, half tablet every day, may be prescribed at investigator discretion for patients judged to be at higher risk of hyperkalaemia or kidney dysfunction. Patients who at baseline are known not to tolerate spironolactone due to gynecomastia or who prefer eplerenone will be prescribed eplerenone. Eplerenone is relatively inexpensive, although more expensive than spironolactone. Spironolactone (or eplerenone) is recommended to be increased to a target dose of 50 mg daily if tolerated.

Most previous RRCTs in Sweden have involved one‐time interventions (i.e. not chronic therapy) without the need for monitoring during follow‐up. Spironolactone is familiar to all clinicians but is associated with a risk of hyperkalaemia and worsening kidney function. Therefore, there are no required in‐person follow‐up visits in the trial, but potassium and eGFR are measured for all patients in both groups at local laboratories at weeks 1, 4, 26, and 52 after randomization, at end of study, 7–14 days after any dose changes, and as needed at the discretion of the investigator. Local sites order blood tests, instruct patients to have blood drawn at their local clinic, and these laboratory results are then available to investigators in Sweden from regional electronic health records, and in the US laboratory data are acquired from site investigators from individual testing sites and/or the electronic medical record. After obtaining the laboratory result, the investigator or study coordinator has telephone contact with the patient and provides instruction on continued treatment and records any events, laboratory values, and treatment decisions in a separate case report form.
