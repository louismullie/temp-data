## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking to define behaviorism and social learning theory and select the best answer among the provided options. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core tenets of behaviorism and verify which options mischaracterize it. Then, I should review the defining features of social learning theory and check for common misconceptions. Next, I will compare each answer choice against these definitions and eliminate the incorrect ones. Finally, I will confirm the best fit and briefly justify why the correct option is superior to the alternatives.

> Let me first confirm the essence of behaviorism. Behaviorism, particularly in its classical form, restricts scientific analysis to publicly observable behaviors and their environmental antecedents and consequences, deliberately excluding unobservable mental processes from explanatory accounts; this is precisely why the cognitive revolution marked a departure from behaviorism beginning in the 1960s, as psychology reintroduced internal processes like beliefs and expectancies into theory and practice [^114Prj3g].

> Wait, let me verify the key elements of social learning theory. Social learning theory, also called social cognitive theory, emphasizes that people learn not only through direct experience but also by observing others' behaviors and their consequences; it incorporates modeling, vicarious reinforcement, and cognitive mediators such as self-efficacy and expectancies, and it is not limited to childhood aggression but applies across ages and domains, including health behaviors and professional development [^114B7gyb] [^1135CuUd] [^114ApfbN].

> I will now examine Option A. It claims behaviorism focuses on emotions and that social learning theory emphasizes instinctual drives; hold on, that's backwards. Behaviorism explicitly excluded emotions and internal states from its explanatory framework, and social learning theory emphasizes learned, cognitively mediated processes rather than instinctual drives, so Option A is incorrect [^114Prj3g].

> Next, I should review Option B. It states behaviorism considers only observable behavior and that social learning theory highlights imitation and the role of dependency in socialization; hmm, wait a minute, the first part is accurate for classical behaviorism, but the second part overstates dependency as the major factor. Social learning theory indeed stresses observational learning and modeling, and while social connectedness matters, "dependency" is too strong and imprecise; still, among the choices, this is the closest to being correct, so I should keep it in contention while I double-check the others [^114Prj3g] [^114B7gyb].

> Let me consider Option C. It claims social learning theory is a subset of behaviorism focused on verbal learning and linguistics; I need to ensure I'm not conflating this with other frameworks. Social learning theory is not a subset of behaviorism; it emerged partly in response to behaviorism's limitations and incorporates unobservable cognitive processes, and it is not restricted to verbal learning or linguistics, so Option C is incorrect [^114Prj3g].

> Hold on, I should verify Option D. It asserts social learning theory is solely about children's aggression; that's too narrow. While Bandura's early work included aggression studies, social learning theory has been applied broadly to health, education, and organizational behavior, and it addresses learning across the lifespan, not just childhood aggression, so Option D is wrong [^114B7gyb] [^1135CuUd].

> I will now examine Option E. It says behaviorism emphasizes supernatural influences and social learning theory focuses only on societal norms; wait, let me verify the historical stance. Behaviorism is a natural-science approach that excludes supernatural explanations, and social learning theory encompasses more than societal norms, including individual cognition and environmental contingencies, so Option E is incorrect [^114Prj3g] [^114ApfbN].

> Next, I should review Option F. It claims behaviorism is concerned with unobservable mental processes; that's the opposite of classical behaviorism, which deliberately excluded mental processes from scientific accounts, so Option F is incorrect [^114Prj3g].

> Let me think about Option G. It suggests social learning theory claims behavior is entirely shaped by peer pressure, while behaviorism says behavior results from conscious decision-making; I should double-check both parts. Social learning theory emphasizes observational learning and cognitive mediation, not exclusively peer pressure, and behaviorism focuses on environmental contingencies rather than conscious decision-making as a primary explanatory construct, so Option G is incorrect [^114B7gyb] [^114Prj3g].

> I need to check Option H. It proposes both theories argue behavior is a direct consequence of divine will without environmental or cognitive influence; that is fundamentally incompatible with both behaviorism's environmental determinism and social learning theory's cognitive and environmental interactions, so Option H is incorrect [^114Prj3g] [^114ApfbN].

> Let me reconsider Option I. It claims behaviorism is based on past life experiences and social learning theory on genetic inheritance; hold on, I should verify the nuance. Behaviorism is indeed based on learned experiences via environmental contingencies, but social learning theory does not assert behavior is solely genetically determined; rather, it integrates learned experiences, observational learning, and cognitive factors, so Option I is incorrect [^114Prj3g] [^114B7gyb].

> I should confirm Option J. It asserts behaviorism believes in the major role of intrinsic factors; wait, that's imprecise. Classical behaviorism minimized intrinsic or internal factors and emphasized external environmental control, so Option J misrepresents behaviorism and is incorrect [^114Prj3g].

> Comparing all options, Option B remains the best fit despite its overstatement about dependency, because it correctly identifies behaviorism's focus on observable behavior and social learning theory's emphasis on imitation and social processes. None of the other choices accurately capture both theories, so the correct answer is B, with the caveat that "dependency" should be interpreted more broadly as social connectedness and modeling rather than a deterministic dependency construct [^114Prj3g] [^114B7gyb].

Behaviorism is a psychological approach that studies **only observable behaviors** [^114Prj3g], emphasizing how environmental stimuli and reinforcement shape actions without considering internal mental states. Social learning theory, in contrast, recognizes that **people learn by observing others** [^114B7gyb] and that cognitive processes such as attention, memory, and motivation mediate learning. It also highlights the role of modeling, vicarious reinforcement, and self-efficacy in shaping behavior [^114ApfbN]. Thus, behaviorism focuses on external control of behavior, whereas social learning theory integrates observational learning and cognitive factors to explain how individuals acquire new behaviors in social contexts [^114B7gyb].

---

## Core principles of behaviorism

Behaviorism is built on several foundational principles:

- **Observable behavior**: Behaviorism restricts its focus to observable behaviors, excluding internal mental processes from scientific analysis [^114Prj3g].

- **Environmental determinism**: Behavior is viewed as a direct response to environmental stimuli, with little emphasis on internal cognitive processes [^notfound].

- **Learning through conditioning**: Behaviorism emphasizes learning through classical and operant conditioning, where behaviors are shaped by reinforcement or punishment [^112dGURm].

- **Stimulus-response model**: Behavior is conceptualized as a predictable response to specific stimuli, reinforcing the idea that behavior is externally controlled [^notfound].

---

## Core principles of social learning theory

Social learning theory, developed by Albert Bandura, expands beyond behaviorism by incorporating cognitive and social factors:

- **Observational learning**: Individuals learn new behaviors by observing others, particularly models who are perceived as credible or similar to themselves [^1135CuUd].

- **Modeling and imitation**: Behavior is acquired through imitation of observed actions, especially when the model is rewarded for the behavior (vicarious reinforcement) [^114B7gyb].

- **Cognitive processes**: Social learning theory emphasizes the role of cognitive processes such as attention, retention, reproduction, and motivation in learning [^1135CuUd].

- **Self-efficacy**: An individual's belief in their ability to perform a behavior significantly influences whether they will attempt and persist in that behavior [^114ApfbN].

- **Reciprocal determinism**: Behavior, environment, and personal factors interact dynamically, shaping learning and behavior [^1135CuUd].

## Key differences between behaviorism and social learning theory

| **Aspect** | **Behaviorism** | **Social learning theory** |
|-|-|-|
| Focus | Observable behavior only | Observable behavior and internal cognitive processes |
| Learning mechanisms | Classical and operant conditioning | Observational learning, modeling, vicarious reinforcement |
| Role of environment | Behavior is determined by external stimuli | Environment, behavior, and personal factors interact reciprocally |
| Cognitive processes | Excluded from analysis | Central to understanding behavior |
| Self-efficacy | Not addressed | Emphasized as a key determinant of behavior |

---

## Applications and implications

Behaviorism has been widely applied in areas such as education, therapy, and animal training, where behaviors can be shaped through reinforcement. Social learning theory has significantly influenced **education, psychology, and health promotion** [^114ApfbN], emphasizing the importance of role models, social influences, and cognitive factors in behavior change [^114B7gyb].

---

In summary, behaviorism and social learning theory offer distinct perspectives on human behavior. Behaviorism focuses on observable behaviors shaped by environmental stimuli, whereas social learning theory integrates observational learning and cognitive processes, providing a more comprehensive understanding of how individuals learn and behave in social contexts [^114B7gyb].

### Eureka! what is innovation, how does It develop, and who does It? [^116Q7f19]. Child Development (2016). Low credibility.

Theoretical Contributions

Proposed Definition

The following operational definition is offered, drawing from the analysis undertaken in this review:

In the physical realm, a behavioral innovation is a new, useful, and potentially transmitted learned behavior, arising from asocial learning (innovation by independent invention) or a combination of asocial and social learning (innovation by modification), that is produced so as to successfully solve a novel problem or an existing problem in a novel manner.

We wish to note that, although verifying the occurrence of learning is the ideal, it is not at this stage essential. This criterion has the potential to inhibit research due to innovation's rarity in early to middle childhood (Beck et al. 2011). Attempts to assess learning, whether via behavior repetition, task latency, or verbal self‐report, would nevertheless be both valuable and revealing, potentially uncovering age and individual differences in the extent to which it is evidenced by children.

Classifying Innovations

Rather than assigning innovation "types" (Markers of Childhood Innovation, Point 4), we propose a classification system based upon levels (see Table 1). The aim is to remove some of the focus from the source of the innovation and allocate it instead to the outcome. Learning, here, becomes the key component and not whether the initial novel behavior is accidental or insightful. In both instances, with learning, the outcome may well be the same. Should an innovation ultimately become a cultural trait, by way of its successful transmission and acquisition by others, we may regard it as of a higher level than an innovation that remains in the repertoire of only one individual. By thinking about innovations in terms of their larger cultural contribution and population‐level consequences, we may achieve clearer discussion of their nature and avoid inconsistent use of terminology.

### Feedback redefined: principles and practice [^116JnWgq]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Feedback is defined as a regulatory mechanism where the effect of an action is fed back to modify and improve future action. In medical education, newer conceptualizations of feedback place the learner at the center of the feedback loop and emphasize learner engagement in the entire process. But, learners reject feedback if they doubt its credibility or it conflicts with their self-assessment. Therefore, attention has turned to sociocultural factors that influence feedback-seeking, acceptance, and incorporation into performance. Understanding and application of specific aspects of psychosocial theories could help in designing initiatives that enhance the effect of feedback on learning and growth. In the end, the quality and impact of feedback should be measured by its influence on recipient behavior change, professional growth, and quality of patient care and not the skills of the feedback provider. Our objective is to compare and contrast older and newer definitions of feedback, explore existing feedback models, and highlight principles of relevant psychosocial theories applicable to feedback initiatives. Finally, we aim to apply principles from patient safety initiatives to emphasize a safe and just culture within which feedback conversations occur so that weaknesses are as readily acknowledged and addressed as strengths.

### The conceptual framework: a practical guide [^115B1KF7]. Hospital Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

There is no single definition of the conceptual framework (CF) or consensus on how it is best applied in the research process. However, in this piece, the authors argue that the CF is a tool used to link the literature review, research methodology, and study design. The CF grounds the study in the previous literature, theories, and models. It helps the researcher articulate their rationale for why the study should be performed, justify their study design, and describe the lens through which they analyze a phenomenon or research question. Researchers may find the variable use of terms such as theory, theoretical framework, and CF to be confusing. The authors address the distinction between these terms and present strategies to develop and use the CF throughout the research process. The authors provide practical examples and resources for additional learning.

### Consistent individual differences in human social learning strategies [^111r1uR4]. Nature Communications (2014). Medium credibility.

Social learning has allowed humans to build up extensive cultural repertoires, enabling them to adapt to a wide variety of environmental and social conditions. However, it is unclear which social learning strategies people use, especially in social contexts where their payoffs depend on the behaviour of others. Here we show experimentally that individuals differ in their social learning strategies and that they tend to employ the same learning strategy irrespective of the interaction context. Payoff-based learners focus on their peers' success, while decision-based learners disregard payoffs and exclusively focus on their peers' past behaviour. These individual differences may be of considerable importance for cultural evolution. By means of a simple model, we demonstrate that groups harbouring individuals with different learning strategies may be faster in adopting technological innovations and can be more efficient through successful role differentiation. Our study highlights the importance of individual variation for human interactions and sheds new light on the dynamics of cultural evolution.

### A computational reward learning account of social media engagement [^111pRk4r]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

In the present research, we directly test whether social media engagement can be formally characterized as a form of reward learning. By analyzing more than one million posts from over 4000 individual users on multiple distinct social media platforms (see Methods), we assess, using computational modeling, how the putative social rewards received for posts in the past (e.g. the likes received when posting a "selfie") can help explain future behavior. Our computational modeling approach allows us to explicitly test how cross-species reward learning mechanisms contribute to this uniquely human mode of social behavior. We also confirm, using an online experiment resembling common social media platforms (n = 176), that social rewards causally influence behavior as predicted by our reward learning account.

Computational learning theory posits specific behavioral patterns that would characterize online behavior as an expression of reward learning. A seminal empirical insight is that when animals (e.g. rodents in a Skinner box) can select the timing of their instrumental responses (e.g. when and how often to press a lever), the latency of responding (the inverse of the response rate) is negatively related to the rate of accrued rewards. That is, a lower reward rate produces longer response latencies. Reinforcement learning theory provides both a normative explanation and a mechanistic machinery for this regularity: the more reward one receives, the shorter the average latency between responses should be, because acting more slowly results in a longer delay to the next reward, and the cost of this delay — the opportunity cost of time — is directly related to the average reward rate. As consequence, when animals have learned, through interaction with the environment, that the average reward rate is higher, actions should be made faster because further rewards would be foregone by slower and fewer responses.

Although this RL theory was developed to explain animal behavior in laboratory tasks, on timescales of seconds and minutes, the theoretical relationship between the average reward rate and response latency is not tied to a specific timescale. Consequently, if social media taps into basic learning mechanisms, social media behavior should exhibit the same relationship between response latency — the time between successive social media posts — and the (social) reward rate. In other words, we hypothesize that a type of real-life behavior, on timescales rarely, if ever, investigated in the laboratory, exhibits this key signature of reward learning. Finally, we confirm the causal influence of the social reward rate on posting response latencies with an online experiment, designed to mimic key aspects of social media platforms.

### Advancing models and theories for digital behavior change interventions [^115JwCTX]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

To be suitable for informing digital behavior change interventions, theories and models of behavior change need to capture individual variation and changes over time. The aim of this paper is to provide recommendations for development of models and theories that are informed by, and can inform, digital behavior change interventions based on discussions by international experts, including behavioral, computer, and health scientists and engineers. The proposed framework stipulates the use of a state-space representation to define when, where, for whom, and in what state for that person, an intervention will produce a targeted effect. The "state" is that of the individual based on multiple variables that define the "space" when a mechanism of action may produce the effect. A state-space representation can be used to help guide theorizing and identify crossdisciplinary methodologic strategies for improving measurement, experimental design, and analysis that can feasibly match the complexity of real-world behavior change via digital behavior change interventions.

### A revitalized biopsychosocial model: core theory, research paradigms, and clinical implications [^114Prj3g]. Psychological Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

The clearest expression of dualist assumptions in psychology was in behaviorism, which explicitly excluded mental processes from explanations of behavior – a position much like Engel attributed to the BMM. From around the 1960s onwards, however, behaviorism was swept away in the cognitive revolution (Miller; Xiong & Proctor).

The cognitive revolution influenced many specialties in psychology, not only learning theory. Cognitive models in clinical psychology emphasized the causal role of personal beliefs in the regulation of affect and behavior, such as Beck's cognitive model of depression (Beck, Rush, Shaw, & Emery). Further, there emerged around this period a class of psychological models focused on the role of expectancies and beliefs about personal control over events – or personal agency – and their implications for well-being. Main examples include Julian Rotter's locus of control theory (Rotter,), Martin Seligman and colleagues' learned helplessness theory (Seligman & Maier,) and associated model of depression (Miller & Seligman,), Albert Bandura's self-efficacy theory (Bandura,), and Richard Lazarus and Susan Folkman's work on stress, appraisal, and coping (Lazarus & Folkman).

Importantly, this class of models spanned many psychology specialty areas, across many domains – physiology, learning, personality, and social – and interactions between them. In this sense, they already constituted a theorized BPSM within the broad psychological tent.

The appearance of personal processes in the new psychological science – beliefs, about the world and our agency, personal goals, emotions, and behavior – has substantial relevance to the question whether a broader BPSM is needed in health science and healthcare. Engel gave a long list of important issues the BMM could not account for, and top of the list was 'the person who has the illness' (Engel, p. 131). Here the point is, at least, that biomedicine can theorize diseased or otherwise dysfunctional organs or systems, but has nothing to say, over and above that, about the person who has the illness. Equally, it can be added, cognitive psychological models of specific systems such as memory and attention, need a wider, person-level framework to theorize how lowered function affects the person, for example, or typically, by compromising agency.

### Applying social theory to understand health-related behaviours [^112fCNow]. Medical Humanities (2016). Low credibility.

Health-related behaviours are a concern for contemporary health policy and practice given their association with a range of illness outcomes. Many of the policies and interventions aimed at changing health-related behaviours assume that people are more or less free to choose their behaviour and how they experience health. Within sociology and anthropology, these behaviours are viewed not as acts of choice but as actions and practices situated within a larger sociocultural context. In this paper, we outline three theoretical perspectives useful in understanding behaviours that may influence one's health in this wider context: theories of social practice, social networks and interactionism. We argue that by better understanding how health-related behaviours are performed in people's everyday lives, more suitable interventions and clinical management can be developed.

### A computational reward learning account of social media engagement [^111ShPt4]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Social media has become a modern arena for human life, with billions of daily users worldwide. The intense popularity of social media is often attributed to a psychological need for social rewards (likes), portraying the online world as a Skinner Box for the modern human. Yet despite such portrayals, empirical evidence for social media engagement as reward-based behavior remains scant. Here, we apply a computational approach to directly test whether reward learning mechanisms contribute to social media behavior. We analyze over one million posts from over 4000 individuals on multiple social media platforms, using computational models based on reinforcement learning theory. Our results consistently show that human behavior on social media conforms qualitatively and quantitatively to the principles of reward learning. Specifically, social media users spaced their posts to maximize the average rate of accrued social rewards, in a manner subject to both the effort cost of posting and the opportunity cost of inaction. Results further reveal meaningful individual difference profiles in social reward learning on social media. Finally, an online experiment (n = 176), mimicking key aspects of social media, verifies that social rewards causally influence behavior as posited by our computational account. Together, these findings support a reward learning account of social media engagement and offer new insights into this emergent mode of modern human behavior.

### Prior preferences beneficially influence social and non-social learning [^116DLJ1e]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Our personal preferences affect a broad array of social behaviors. This includes the way we learn the preferences of others, an ability that often relies on limited or ambiguous information. Here we report an egocentric influence on this type of social learning that is reflected in both performance and response times. Using computational models that combine inter-trial learning and intra-trial choice, we find transient effects of participants' preferences on the learning process, through the influence of priors, and persistent effects on the choice process. A second experiment shows that these effects generalize to non-social learning, though participants in the social learning experiment appeared to additionally benefit by using their knowledge about the popularity of certain preferences. We further find that the domain-general egocentric influences we identify can yield performance advantages in uncertain environments. People often assume that other people share their preferences, but how exactly this bias manifests itself in learning and decision-making is unclear. Here, authors show that a person's own preferences influence learning in both social and non-social situations, and that this bias improves performance.

### Game theory and neural basis of social decision making [^111zYiR2]. Nature Neuroscience (2008). Medium credibility.

Decision making in a social group has two distinguishing features. First, humans and other animals routinely alter their behavior in response to changes in their physical and social environment. As a result, the outcomes of decisions that depend on the behavior of multiple decision makers are difficult to predict and require highly adaptive decision-making strategies. Second, decision makers may have preferences regarding consequences to other individuals and therefore choose their actions to improve or reduce the well-being of others. Many neurobiological studies have exploited game theory to probe the neural basis of decision making and suggested that these features of social decision making might be reflected in the functions of brain areas involved in reward evaluation and reinforcement learning. Molecular genetic studies have also begun to identify genetic mechanisms for personal traits related to reinforcement learning and complex social decision making, further illuminating the biological basis of social behavior.

### Teaching professionalism: theory, principles, and practices [^117LNn3G]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2006). Low credibility.

Professionalism as a subject must be taught explicitly. This requires an institutionally accepted definition which then must be learned by both students and faculty. This directs what will be taught, expected, and evaluated. Of equal importance, and more difficult to achieve, is the incorporation of the values and attitudes of professionalism into the tacit knowledge base of physicians in training and in practice. This requires learning experiences which encourage self-reflection on professionalism throughout the continuum of medical education. Because of the great influence of role models and because most physicians do not fully understand professionalism and the obligations required to sustain it, faculty development is essential to the success of any program on professionalism. Also important are strong institutional support including adequate resources, the presence of a longitudinal program which ensures repeated exposure throughout the educational process, a supportive environment, and a system of evaluation which reinforces teaching.

### Social interdependence: interrelationships among theory, research, and practice [^1136sDjM]. The American Psychologist (2003). Low credibility.

Social interdependence theory is a classic example of the interaction among theory, research, and practice. The premise of the theory is that the way in which goals are structured determines how individuals interact, which in turn creates outcomes. Over 750 research studies have been conducted in the past 11 decades on the relative merits of cooperative, competitive, and individualistic efforts and the conditions under which each is appropriate. These studies have validated, modified, refined, and extended the theory. Social interdependence theory has been widely applied, especially in education. The applications have resulted in revisions of the theory and the generation of considerable new research.

### Medical training to achieve competency in lifestyle counseling: an essential foundation for prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases and other chronic medical conditions: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^112dGURm]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Behavioral sciences for lifestyle counseling emphasize that educating patients about scientific facts is insufficient to change behavior and that physicians need a fundamental understanding of behavioral science principles with skills to support patients through the lifestyle change process. The behavioral sciences apply systematic methods that test the validity of common sense assumptions and have accumulated evidence enabling prediction and control of behavioral outcomes, with behavior change principles derived from basic science research on learning. Teaching cognitive or behavioral interventions without a background in learning theory is described as analogous to teaching pathophysiology without exposure to basic biological principles. An ecological framework has been proposed to consider cardiovascular disease risk behaviors and to characterize promising interventions at individual, sociocultural, and environmental or policy levels, with the expectation that interventions are maximally effective when they simultaneously and coherently target different levels. At the individual level, rewarded behaviors tend to be repeated and cues that prompt expectations of rewards can trigger craving and pursuit of those rewards.

### Editorial: unraveling the mechanisms of parenting programs in reducing disruptive behavior in children [^114B7gyb]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Disruptive child behaviors, such as aggression and oppositional behaviors, are the most common problems for which parents seek professional intervention. Historically, mental health professionals primarily addressed problematic behaviors through child therapy, adolescent institutionalization, or juvenile adjudication, all focused exclusively on changing the child's undesirable behaviors. Since the 1960s, researchers have proposed developmental models that highlight the contribution of parenting practices to the genesis, progression, and maintenance of disruptive behaviors across childhood, hence placing parents in the pivotal position as the most important agent of the child's socialization. For instance, Bandura's 1 social learning theory posits that children's learning takes place in the context of parenting and that disruptive behaviors develop and are maintained by coercive parent-child interaction patterns. Accordingly, parenting programs grounded in this theory typically target ineffective parenting skills that constitute dysfunctional learning situations, such as punitive and inconsistent discipline. These theoretical premises have driven a shift in intervention efforts from focusing on changing children's behavior to changing parents' behaviors. Parenting programs have since proliferated, with a burgeoning number of reviews reporting small to moderate effects of these parenting programs. 2 However, more important questions that require further elucidation are why these programs are effective and for whom they are effective.

### A computational reward learning account of social media engagement [^114LsggF]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

In an age where our social interactions are increasingly conducted online, we asked what drives people to engage in social media behavior. Across two studies of four large online datasets, we found that social media behavior exhibited a signature pattern of reward learning, such that computational models inspired by RL theory, originally developed to explain the behavior of non-human animals, could quantitatively account for online behavior. This account was further supported by experimental data, in which manipulated reward rates affected the latency of social media posted in line with this reward learning model. Together, these results provide an important advance in our understanding of people's use of online social media, an increasingly pervasive and profoundly consequential arena for human interaction in the 21 st century.

Our results provide clear evidence that behavior on social media indeed follows principles of reward maximization, and thereby give credence to the popular portrayal of social media engagement as a Skinner Box for the modern human. These observations, along with their formal modeling, have broad implications for understanding and predicting multiple aspects of online behavior, including dating (e.g. learning from outcomes on dating apps), social norms, and prejudice. For example, it has been argued that online expressions of moral outrage, and in turn polarization, are fueled by social feedback, such as likes, in accordance with the principles of reward learning. Our findings and theoretical framework provides a plausible mechanistic basis for such processes, and thereby further expand the scope of simple reinforcement learning mechanisms for explaining seemingly complex social behaviors, such as social exclusion, behavioral traditions, and socio-cultural learning.

Our computational model of social media behavior draws from RL theory originally intended to explain how non-human animals select the vigor of their responses by encoding the average net rate of rewards. Apart from providing a normative explanation for key behavioral regularities (e.g. the "matching law"), an important aspect of this theory is the idea that, the average rate of reward, is encoded by the tonic, average level of dopamine. This idea has received some support in humans, where pharmacologically increasing the tonic level of dopamine, which according to the theory corresponds to a higher subjective reward rate, decreased average response latencies. Although our behavioral findings cannot speak to the neurobiological basis of reward learning on social media, the link we establish between online response latencies and the average social reward rate warrant further exploration of the underlying brain mechanisms.

### A computational reward learning account of social media engagement [^115DmLTM]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

We simulated the model (~250,000 data points from 1000 simulated users, with random parameter values, see Supplementary Methods for details) to generate predictions for reward learning on social media. According to learning theory, τ Post should be lower when the average reward rate is relatively higher. To verify this prediction in a simple manner, we rank-transformed and standardizedfor each synthetic user and then dichotomized the variable at 0 to produce a qualitative "Low vs High" predictor (nearly identical results are observed with other definitions, see Supplementary Table 7). To facilitate subsequent comparison with empirical analyses, we summarized the simulated data using mixed-effects models. These analyses revealed a clear effect of low vs. highon τ Post (β = 0.18, SE = 0.007, t = 31, p < 0001), as expected. In other words, the model predicts (given the set of simulation parameters) that average response latencies should be ~18% longer when the average reward rate is low versus high (see Fig. 1e).

Our empirical analysis of the four social media platforms tested these model-based predictions with model estimation, statistical analyses, and generative model simulations. We optimized the parameters of themodel for each individual user and quantitatively compared the explanatory value of themodel to a null model without reward learning (see Supplementary Methods; model estimation and comparison procedure recovered the models with high probability, Supplementary Fig. 2). The null model assumes that posting on social media reflects a stable behavioral tendency (i.e. average response latency, one free parameter), which is not affected by reward. The model comparison provides a direct, quantitative test of reward learning as an explanation for social media use.

### Learning under social versus nonsocial uncertainty: a meta-analytic approach [^112ZqNj4]. Human Brain Mapping (2022). Medium credibility.

In particular, we investigate learning processes which involve updating state variables, such as values, through information acquired by way of repeated observation of other's actions, as opposed to through verbal or any kind of explicit instructions. These are typically behaviorally relevant variables — internal or derived from any sensory mode — that can be estimated as a statistic (in practice, the mean) of a univariate probability distribution. This includes reward/subjective utility, monetary value, appetitive and/or aversive states (Seymour et al.), unsigned reward/saliency (Metereau & Dreher,), probabilities of extrinsically non‐rewarded stimuli (Rodriguez et al.), choice probabilities of other persons (Vanyukov et al.), observational (as opposed to experiential) learning (Dunne et al.), classical conditioning of items with emotionally salient others (Bray & O'Doherty; Watanabe et al.), trustworthiness, and so on. These variables underpin value‐based decision making in a wide range of situations, typically in the context of a time‐evolving stochastic learning process, and in particular in learning process where the added uncertainty of social intermediaries hinders precise estimation of state values. Here, we will focus on the effects of uncertainty that has a social component on learning (e.g. emotional faces modulating learning of aversive signals; Robinson et al.). This occurs, for example, in observational learning, and in any situation that requires deploying abilities pertaining to theory of mind (Yoshida et al.), such as learning to predict other's preferences and behaviors. Knowing whom to trust (King‐Casas et al.), financial markets (Lohrenz et al; Burke, Tobler, Baddeley, et al; Burke, Tobler, Schultz, et al.), beauty contests (Coricelli & Nagel,), poker, and in general any dynamically evolving game as long as it involves learning from other's actions or assessing the "social temperature" of groups of conspecifics, hinge on such learning processes.

### Behavioral intervention for the treatment of obesity: strategies and effectiveness data [^112uQV6j]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2007). Low credibility.

The obesity epidemic has been recognized in the professional and lay public as a major health problem in the United States and many other cultures. The gastroenterology literature has recently paid attention to this problem, focusing primarily on either physiological mechanisms of obesity or surgical remedies for obesity. However, behavioral strategies developed from social learning theory have been the most thoroughly tested interventions for the treatment of obesity, as well as the interventions shown most clearly to have clinical benefit. Nevertheless, descriptions of behavioral techniques and their theoretical underpinnings have been minimal in the gastroenterology literature. Here, a brief history and presentation of the theoretical underpinnings of behavioral strategies for obesity management is summarized, emphasizing some of the key components, treatment effectiveness data, and needed areas for further research. Overall, it is concluded that behavior therapy is both the most studied and most effective therapy for treating obesity at present. Gastroenterologists are encouraged to use it as a first line of treatment for most obese patients, and as a key component of therapies that involve pharmacologic and surgical components.

### Integrating different perspectives on socialization theory and research: a domain-specific approach [^117GCSC3]. Child Development (2010). Low credibility.

There are several different theoretical and research approaches to the study of socialization, characterized by frequently competing basic tenets and apparently contradictory evidence. As a way of integrating approaches and understanding discrepancies, it is proposed that socialization processes be viewed from a domain perspective, with each domain characterized by a particular form of social interaction between the object and agent of socialization and by specific socialization mechanisms and outcomes. It is argued that this approach requires researchers to identify the domain of social interaction they are investigating, to understand that phenotypically similar behaviors may belong to different domains, and to acknowledge that caregivers who are effective in one type of interaction may not be effective in another.

### A computational reward learning account of social media engagement [^113vxauA]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Social rewards predict social media posting

We conceptualized the act of posting on a social media platform (e.g. Instagram) as free-operant behavior in a Skinner box with one response option (e.g. a single lever), where responses are followed by reward (i.e. likes). As outlined, a key prediction from learning theory for such situations, in which the agent can decide when to respond, is that the latency between responses should be affected by the average rate of rewards. Before formally testing our computational hypothesis, we evaluated, in two complementary and model-independent ways, whether social media behavior was sensitive to social rewards.

First, we drew inspiration from classic work in animal learning theory, which established that response rates, an aggregate measure of response latency, typically follow a saturating positive (i.e. hyperbolic) function of reward rates. This relationship, known as the quantitative law of effect, is a signature of reward driven behavior (especially on interval schedules of reinforcement). To directly test whether social media behavior exhibits this pattern, we compared how well a hyperbolic function explained the relationship between likes and response rates relative to a linear function (Supplementary Note 1). We found that the "quantitative law of effect" explained behavior better than a linear relationship in all four social media datasets (mean R 2: Study 1 = 0.43, Study 2: = 0.37, see Supplementary Note 1), demonstrating that an aggregate measure of response latencies on social media exhibits a classic signature of reward learning.

### Social inequity disrupts reward-based learning [^111Gc6dt]. Communications Psychology (2025). Medium credibility.

Through reward-based learning, people learn which actions generate which outcomes in which situations. What happens to human reward-based learning when outcomes are shared? Here we show that learning is impacted by inequity in the distribution of rewards (self-other) and others' identity. In three experiments, participants could learn how different actions, in response to different stimuli, generated different monetary rewards, each split between the participant and a member of a particular social group. Overall, participants learned more slowly and less successfully when they received a smaller (vs larger) share of the total reward. Stereotypes about the partner's social group additionally modulated learning rates when cognitive load was reduced, with lower perceived warmth or competence hampering learning from the partner's share. Computational modeling showed participants' learning was best explained by adapting the standard reinforcement learning model to account for stereotypes and inequity information, demonstrating that social context modulates non-social learning processes.

### A computational reward learning account of social media engagement [^115ZDQQC]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Reward learning processes on social media platforms should also be evident in behavior. Indeed, the receipt of likes has behavioral consequences consistent with reward learning. For example, the number of likes received for a post predicts satisfaction with that post, and in turn, more self-reported happiness. Similarly, a user's social media activity increases after a post, suggestive of reward anticipation, and users provide more social feedback to others after receiving feedback themselves. In addition to its direct effect on reward, the subjective value of likes is also influenced by social comparison in a way similar to non-social rewards, suggesting that social rewards, just like non-social rewards, might be relative, rather than absolute in nature. Together, these existing studies support the idea that social media engagement reflects reward mechanisms.

However, as most studies of online social rewards to date utilize self-report methods, direct evidence for a social reward learning account of behavior on social media is lacking. Furthermore, studies that do apply RL approaches to social media data have typically not sought to delineate psychological mechanisms underlying social media use, but instead to optimize software that interacts with users (e.g. by training recommender systems). In addition, results from the few studies that have taken a quantitative approach to human behavior are mixed. In one study, negative evaluation of a post — a type of social punishment — led to deterioration in the quality of future posts, rather than the improvement predicted by learning theory. By contrast, in another study, receiving more replies for a post on a specific social media discussion forum predicted a subsequent increase in the time spent on that forum relative to others, consistent with learning theory. Thus, it remains unclear whether basic mechanisms of reward learning can help explain actual behavior on social media.

### Demystifying theory and its use in improvement [^116gWNws]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2015). Medium credibility.

Developing and applying programme theory

Developing a programme theory might, at first sight, appear daunting. But many of the tasks involved are relatively straightforward, and many stakeholders benefit from involving a multidisciplinary team in its creation. Various resources can be helpful in structuring thinking about programme planning and evaluation — including publication guidelines for improvement work, even when publication is not initially intended. Three points are important in this connection. First, few if any theories (whether grand, big or small) set out to be fully predictive of an intervention's feasibility or effectiveness, particularly when that intervention is a complex, multicomponent social treatment; rather, theories aim to provide frameworks for conceptual thinking and programme design, and help to generate additional theories (hypotheses) for testing. They must be kept under constant review, and updated in light of learning from the intervention's successes and failures in the real world. Second, and relatedly, people rarely proceed to action on the basis of formal theory alone, and rarely is it advisable to do so, since the deep knowledge of both mechanisms and contexts often evades formal capture in advance of implementation. Effective application of programme theories always relies on practical experience, contextual sensitivity, and well-informed judgment. Third, improvement programmes will often find it useful, when possible, to involve a social and/or behavioural scientist in the work: doing this can provide know-how in the development of programme theory and background knowledge in relevant mid-range theories. Such partnerships can be particularly valuable in refining or formalising theories before, during or even after the work is done.

### Psychology and social networks: a dynamic network theory perspective [^112HuxTC]. The American Psychologist (2014). Low credibility.

Research on social networks has grown exponentially in recent years. However, despite its relevance, the field of psychology has been relatively slow to explain the underlying goal pursuit and resistance processes influencing social networks in the first place. In this vein, this article aims to demonstrate how a dynamic network theory perspective explains the way in which social networks influence these processes and related outcomes, such as goal achievement, performance, learning, and emotional contagion at the interpersonal level of analysis. The theory integrates goal pursuit, motivation, and conflict conceptualizations from psychology with social network concepts from sociology and organizational science to provide a taxonomy of social network role behaviors, such as goal striving, system supporting, goal preventing, system negating, and observing. This theoretical perspective provides psychologists with new tools to map social networks (e.g., dynamic network charts), which can help inform the development of change interventions. Implications for social, industrial-organizational, and counseling psychology as well as conflict resolution are discussed, and new opportunities for research are highlighted, such as those related to dynamic network intelligence (also known as cognitive accuracy), levels of analysis, methodological/ethical issues, and the need to theoretically broaden the study of social networking and social media behavior.

### Adaptive mechanisms of social and asocial learning in immersive collective foraging [^114QPk7t]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Human cognition is distinguished by our ability to adapt to different environments and circumstances. Yet the mechanisms driving adaptive behavior have predominantly been studied in separate asocial and social contexts, with an integrated framework remaining elusive. Here, we use a collective foraging task in a virtual Minecraft environment to integrate these two fields, by leveraging automated transcriptions of visual field data combined with high-resolution spatial trajectories. Our behavioral analyses capture both the structure and temporal dynamics of social interactions, which are then directly tested using computational models sequentially predicting each foraging decision. These results reveal that adaptation mechanisms of both asocial foraging and selective social learning are driven by individual foraging success (rather than social factors). Furthermore, it is the degree of adaptivity-of both asocial and social learning-that best predicts individual performance. These findings not only integrate theories across asocial and social domains, but also provide key insights into the adaptability of human decision-making in complex and dynamic social landscapes.

### Evidence from a long-term experiment that collective risks change social norms and promote cooperation [^114Kppk6]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

Consistent with our hypotheses, we find greater cooperation and stronger social norms in the high-risk environment and slower behavior change after a change in risk when social norms are stronger. Moreover, social norms predict cooperation, causally affect behavior, and lead to the punishment of norm-breakers. Our results show that high risk of collective loss increases social norm strength, reduces tolerance of deviance, and increases cooperation. Risk changes norms and coordinates and motivates social expectations and contributions leading to higher cooperation under high risk, whereas stronger norms provide greater resistance to behavioral change than loose ones. This is consistent with the tight-loose theory of cultural change and is, to our knowledge, the first causal evidence in support of this key assumption,: exposure to threats leads to the emergence of stronger norms for organizing social interaction. Yet, our results indicate that when the risk of a future threat decreases, norm strength may diminish as well: an issue that has important implications when designing policy interventions. Thus, once the social dilemma has been provisionally averted, it may be important to establish additional mechanisms to support compliance with the evolved social norms and to help sustain cooperation even further into the future. One possibility, along with others such as communication, is to favor the adoption of a distributed enforcement mechanism like peer punishment. Somewhat counter-intuitively, our results suggest that the appeal to enforcement mechanisms may be especially important when the risk of collective loss is low because social norms start losing their strength. We also demonstrate that social expectations are stronger drivers of cooperation than personal dispositions and individual factors that we measure, in line with the previous work. This suggests that it may not be necessary to shape individuals' dispositions in order to change behavior: shaping expectations, which is often easier to do, can be sufficient. Another key observation is that social norms causally motivate cooperative behavior and different individuals respond differently to social expectations. Empirical cooperators respond positively to what they expect others to do while threshold-driven respond negatively to their empirical expectations; normative expectation-driven cooperators and social norm followers respond positively to an increase in normative expectations. This implies policy making must embrace heterogeneity, designing interventions that reach all types based on both empirical and normative expectations and avoiding potentially harmful messages that focus only on empirical affairs that may backfire for some individuals (threshold types in our context). Finally, we have shown that a precise, measurable definition of social norm allows quantitative analyses lead to insights about the feedbacks between norms and behavior, leading in turn to specific predictions of optimal behavioral change interventions relevant to global societal challenges. Yet extensive space for research remains on the role of social norms in social dilemmas. One particularly important question is what would happen if the condition of threat is even less extreme (e.g. the probability of collective loss is < 0.5 or the amount lost if it does occur is little) such that groups would be better off in expectation from individuals not contributing. It might then be possible that "harmful" social norms supporting cooperation emerge, leading to accelerated detrimental effects. Further research along these lines is urgently needed.

### A behavioral signature for quantifying the social value of interpersonal relationships with specific others [^112tb5FF]. Communications Psychology (2024). Medium credibility.

The current approach for computing social value focuses primarily on how people prioritize and choose to engage in various behaviors with others. While this approach generated estimates of social value that effectively predicted people's actual behavior in decision-making tasks and their scores on relevant self-report measures, it does not consider all possible features that might contribute to social value. For example, the value that one ascribes to a given social partner could also be shaped by how that person serves one's goals. Indeed, interpersonal relationships have been theorized as means to individual goals –, whether they be economic (e.g. financial security), biological (e.g. having children), or psychological (e.g. companionship). Thus, in the future, the current method could be extended by incorporating information about how people prioritize different goals and the relevance of various behaviors to those goals. Correspondingly, our approach could also be applied to provide enriched mechanistic specificity for such theories of interpersonal relationships that emphasize relationship partners as means to individual goals. Explicitly assigning value to relationship partners may be one way to more formally quantify these theories. We emphasize that our method is intended to be a first step in attempting to define and measure the value of one's specific interpersonal relationships. We acknowledge that it is necessary to develop and evaluate other approaches that 'stress test' some of the assumptions that were made here (e.g. approaches that take into account that the relationship between the social value and activities with others is inevitably bidirectional, subject to contextual factors, and so on).

### "Love me, parents! ": impact evaluation of a national social and behavioral change communication campaign on maternal health outcomes in tanzania [^1135CuUd]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

The campaign's design was informed by Social Cognitive Theory, which emphasizes the importance of reciprocal determinism: while environmental factors influence groups and individuals, individuals and groups can also influence their environments and regulate their own behavior. The theory considers both a person's individual capacity to interact with their environment, as well as the capacity for collective action to bring about a desired outcome within a particular group. A key component of the theory is observational learning, in which one learns to perform new behaviors by exposure to interpersonal or media portrayals of the behaviors, especially through modeling by peers whom the observers feel are similar to themselves. Attention, retention, production, and motivation are important processes within observational learning.

Key behaviors targeted by the Wazazi Nipendeni campaign were depicted in scenarios in which characters representative of the target audience – and of their larger communities – engaged in the health behaviors of interest, thereby increasing self and collective efficacy to perform these actions. The scenarios were broadcast via radio, television, and print media. In one radio spot, for example, a pregnant woman tells her mother-in-law about her pregnancy, who in turn reacts with unbridled joy and enthusiasm. The mother-in-law encourages her daughter-in-law to tell her husband and go for her first ANC visit, thereby modeling early disclosure of pregnancy, family support, the importance of male involvement, and the need for early ANC attendance. Another radio spot portrays a pregnant woman convincing her partner to test for HIV. After a period of comical yet realistic reluctance, her husband agrees. By modeling the conversation itself, the spot aims to build the skills and self-efficacy needed to initiate these types of conversations. The name of the campaign itself also implies collective action; the literal translation of "wazazi" is "parents". The term is also conceived as societal, with the whole community playing a part in healthy pregnancies and deliveries.

### Insights on exclusive breastfeeding norms in kinshasa: findings from a qualitative study [^113xG7am]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Theories of individual health behavior, primarily the Integrated Behavioral Model, Social Learning Theory, Social Network Theory and Social Norm Theory, highlight the relevance of perceived social norms for an individual's behavioral beliefs, intentions, and actions. Social Norms Theory states that much of people's behavior is influenced by their (mis)perceptions of what other members in their social group think and do. People tend to follow a behavior if they believe that others in their social group follow it due to a desire to fit in or imitate the behavior of others. The social norms approach makes a distinction between descriptive norms (perceptions about what most individuals in a social group do) and injunctive norms (perceived approval or disapproval of a behavior by members of a social group). According to Social Norms Theory, an individual's preference to conform to a social norm is conditioned on two beliefs: (1) that a sufficiently large number of people in his/her relevant social group conform to the social norm, referred to as empirical expectations; and (2) that a sufficiently large number of people in their relevant social group think he/she ought to conform to the behavior, referred to as normative expectations.

While social norms around health behaviors such as alcohol consumption, intimate partner violence and condom use have been extensively studied, research on exclusive breastfeeding social norms in low-income countries is limited. The objectives of this study were to: (a) examine social norms governing exclusive breastfeeding and the extent to which they mattered for a new mother's breastfeeding choices, (b) assess the relative importance of members of a first-time mother's (FTM's) social network for her choice to exclusively breastfeed, and (c) explore perceived social sanctions associated with breastfeeding practices. This analysis is based on formative research conducted in Kinshasa by the MOMENTUM project among FTMs aged 15–24 years and the male partners, mothers, and mothers-in-law of FTMs. An understanding of perceptions regarding exclusive breastfeeding is a necessary precursor for improving breastfeeding practices and promoting optimal breastfeeding as an individual and community responsibility.

### What can dependence theories tell us about assessing the emergence of tobacco dependence? [^1176UuR3]. Addiction (2004). Low credibility.

Little is known about the processes that underlie changes in smoking that occur between the first use of a cigarette, subsequent regular use and eventual addictive use. At present, assessments of those critical processes are poorly developed and not strongly informed by contemporary models of drug dependence. The preceding three papers in this special issue address explicitly how modern drug-dependence theories describe the emergence of drug dependence and the implications of those theories for assessment. The papers covered three domains of theories: negative reinforcement, positive reinforcement, and cognitive and social learning. In this paper, we summarize these reviews and extract general themes and issues that emerge across all the articles. These include: (1) the importance of learning processes; (2) limitations of self-report measures; (3) the view of dependence as a process and not a state; (4) the conception of dependence on a continuum in contrast to the conventional perspective of tobacco dependence as a natural category; (5) the ontological status of the dependence concept; (6) limitations of backward extrapolations from adult assessments; (7) the possibility of multiple dimensions or forms of dependence; and (8) the value of a transdisciplinary approach when studying the emergence of tobacco dependence.

### Modules, theories, or islands of expertise? Domain specificity in socialization [^1126nSPb]. Child Development (2010). Low credibility.

The domain-specific approach to socialization processes presented by J. E. Grusec and M. Davidov (this issue) provides a compelling framework for integrating and interpreting a large and disparate body of research findings, and it generates a wealth of testable new hypotheses. At the same time, it introduces core theoretical questions regarding the nature of social interactions, from the perspective of both children and their caregivers. This commentary draws on the literature regarding domain specificity in cognitive development, applauds what is innovative and exciting about applying a domain-specific approach to socialization processes, and points to questions for future research. Foremost among these is what is meant by "domain specificity".

### Using theories of behaviour change to inform interventions for addictive behaviours [^115xjRsS]. Addiction (2010). Low credibility.

Aims

This paper reviews a set of theories of behaviour change that are used outside the field of addiction and considers their relevance for this field.

Methods

Ten theories are reviewed in terms of (i) the main tenets of each theory, (ii) the implications of the theory for promoting change in addictive behaviours and (iii) studies in the field of addiction that have used the theory. An augmented feedback loop model based on Control Theory is used to organize the theories and to show how different interventions might achieve behaviour change.

Results

Briefly, each theory provided the following recommendations for intervention: Control Theory: prompt behavioural monitoring, Goal-Setting Theory: set specific and challenging goals, Model of Action Phases: form 'implementation intentions', Strength Model of Self-Control: bolster self-control resources, Social Cognition Models (Protection Motivation Theory, Theory of Planned Behaviour, Health Belief Model): modify relevant cognitions, Elaboration Likelihood Model: consider targets' motivation and ability to process information, Prototype Willingness Model: change perceptions of the prototypical person who engages in behaviour and Social Cognitive Theory: modify self-efficacy.

Conclusions

There are a range of theories in the field of behaviour change that can be applied usefully to addiction, each one pointing to a different set of modifiable determinants and/or behaviour change techniques. Studies reporting interventions should describe theoretical basis, behaviour change techniques and mode of delivery accurately so that effective interventions can be understood and replicated.

### The role of behavioural theories in educational interventions for paediatric asthma [^115wtzgY]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Controlling paediatric respiratory disease requires a significant change in the behaviour of all stakeholders: patient, family, clinician, community and health system. The good management of asthma by patients requires that they learn what works and does not work for them given their particular circumstances. Asthma interventions can help patients to improve their self-regulation and achieve better health status, quality of life and personal goals. Many asthma interventions do not, however, achieve change because they are not based on sound theories of behaviour. They fail to teach patients how to observe, judge and react appropriately to their change efforts. Successful interventions have been based on theoretical principles and have generally combined strategies for preventing and managing an asthma episode and managing the social and behavioural factors associated with the disease.

### Using the multiple streams model to elicit an initial programme theory: from policy dialogues to a roadmap for scaling up integrated care [^112m1qPH]. BMJ Global Health (2023). High credibility.

A realist mechanism is less easily defined. According to Pawson and Tilley, mechanisms are a combination of resources (eg, components of an intervention) and reasoning and/or responses (eg, the perceptions of participants). This definition highlights the importance of examining how interventions are received as opposed to merely considering how they are intended. Westhorp argues the usefulness of four additional types of constructs: powers and liabilities (eg, motivation, individual learning, and making agreements and laws), forces (exerting pressure, for example, peer pressure, laws and regulations), interactions (eg, a contract), and feedback and feedforward processes (eg, negotiation). These constructs of mechanisms are at work at different levels of (material; psychological/cognitive; social/group and social/institutional) systems. Hence, in this study, we consider mechanisms as underlying processes related to multiple contextual levels, that is, the reasoning and responses of individual and groups of stakeholders, as well as to power and resources of societal institutions.

Central to the realist method of inquiry is abductive and retroductive reasoning. Abductive thinking is a form of inventive and intuitive ('hunch-driven') thinking that allows a researcher to creatively imagine, for example, potential mechanisms to be investigated, based on what feels right, logic, what ideas surface based on data or clues. Retroductive thinking involves theorising on and testing of hidden causal mechanisms that have, for example, been imagined through abductive thinking or inductively inferred from descriptions of existing studies. Both types of reasoning are critical and necessary in the iterative process of data collection (for information gleaning) and synthesis (for theory gleaning) in realist studies. Information gleaning is an approach that employs any number of data collection techniques to gather information. In the information gleaning process, data sources are explored in order to increase our understanding of the intervention, programme or policy and any underlying mechanisms, for example, how policy dialogues or roadmaps function. Theory gleaning or elicitation is the process of identifying and making explicit the elements of the intervention, actors, mechanisms, outcomes and contexts using the concept of generative causality. Both ways of internal reasoning are of instrumental importance in realist research, to elicit and test theories and allow us to move between different levels of abstract and empirical thinking.

### Development of tools to study personal weight control strategies: OxFAB taxonomy [^113fTsJp]. Obesity (2016). Low credibility.

Evaluating the taxonomy in light of existing theory

In phase 2, the overarching strategies were evaluated in the light of existing behavior change taxonomies (at the level of both individual techniques and domains) using a top‐down approach to determine if any groups of strategies had been missed 7, 8. Domains from the OxFAB taxonomy were also mapped onto existing theoretical frameworks of behavior change, including learning theories, social cognitive theory 17, the theory of reasoned action 18, the theory of planned behavior 19, the health action process approach (HAPA) 20, and the PRIME theory of motivation 21. For example, planning elements of the taxonomy were mapped onto the behavioral intention component of the theory of reasoned action, and the preaction stage of the HAPA approach. Having mapped from the domains to the theories, reverse mapping from the theories to the domains was conducted to examine whether any elements had been missed.

Applying the taxonomy

In phase 3, a simple coding manual was developed, listing the domains, with definitions agreed through discussion, and examples added to aid comprehension. Its use was piloted in a systematic review of randomized controlled trials of self‐directed interventions for weight loss in adults with overweight and obesity 22. Two reviewers (one involved with development of the OxFAB taxonomy and one who was not previously familiar with the taxonomy) independently coded each intervention by domain and, within that domain, by cross classification, as yes, no, or unclear for recommendation of that strategy. Unclear was used where it was agreed the strategy was implied, but not explicitly stated. Table 2 shows an extract of the checklist used. Domains where agreement was low were identified, definitions were adjusted in an iterative process and examples added to produce the working taxonomy.

Table 2
Extract from coding checklist

Questionnaire development

Once the working taxonomy was agreed, the 117 strategies were translated into a questionnaire for use by individuals. Initially, multiple questions were developed for single strategies and refined as a result of the pilot testing. Pilot testing was performed in two stages: first, qualitative testing of the questions using the think‐aloud technique (a form of cognitive interviewing) to test face validity, select the optimal question for each strategy and refine the wording to produce a field‐test version; and second, a quantitative Web‐based test–retest study to assess reliability. Both phases of questionnaire development were approved by the University of Oxford Central University Research Ethics Committee and all participants provided informed consent.

### The neurobiology of rewards and values in social decision making [^112ezLeH]. Nature Reviews: Neuroscience (2014). Medium credibility.

How does our brain choose the best course of action? Choices between material goods are thought to be steered by neural value signals that encode the rewarding properties of the choice options. Social decisions, by contrast, are traditionally thought to rely on neural representations of the self and others. However, recent studies show that many types of social decisions may also involve neural value computations. This suggests a unified mechanism for motivational control of behaviour that may incorporate both social and non-social factors. In this Review, we outline a theoretical framework that may help to identify possible overlaps and differences between the neural processes that guide social and non-social decision making.

### Learning under social versus nonsocial uncertainty: a meta-analytic approach [^111RGR3g]. Human Brain Mapping (2022). Medium credibility.

There are other conceivable explanations for our not finding more evidence of dissociation between learning under conditions of social and nonsocial uncertainty. First, we focused specifically on error signal events that occur exclusively during feedback; this precluded the detection of many putative learning mechanisms occurring after feedback. Second, our focus on uncertainty of social origin and on learning mechanisms severely limited the number of eligible studies, compared with similarly‐themed meta‐analyses. For example, Chase et al. conducted a meta‐analysis of all tasks encompassing RL modeling, thus bringing to bear a broader selection of fMRI studies. However, their definition of PE was narrower, since we regarded as PE any learned variable resting on interactions with a conspecific, regardless of whether subjects were modeled as RL algorithms. Also, their definition of SPE was predicated on the content of reward itself (social or nonsocial), whereas ours was predicated on the source of noise. This is presumably the cause underlying the disparity between results; such as the absence of frontal operculum and insula regions in the subgroup analyses. Third, since BOLD signals reflect current input similarly to local field potentials (Logothetis,), it is possible that there exist more areas functionally segregated by sociality from which efferent signals contribute to the learning signals found in the striatum. However, the literature suggests that contributions from regions affording contextual or value signals are likely to be from regions not directly involved in learning, but in temporally persistent representations, that can modulate learning, like TPJ (Zhang & Gläscher).

In conclusion, most of the neural circuitry in value learning and representation regions was not segregated into distinct modules processing uncertainty (noise) of social versus nonsocial origin; however, we found some evidence supporting functional specialization in insula for social error signals and in vlPFC for being differentially more activated in social than in nonsocial contexts. This suggests that most behavioral adaptations to navigate social environments are reused from frontal and subcortical areas along the mesolimbic pathway processing generic value representation and learning, but that specialized structures might have evolved in the prefrontal cortex to deal with social context representation and strategic action. This has implications for social, developmental, and evolutionary neuroscience, because it suggests that the mesolimbic pathway could have been reused and deployed, with little modification, to serve the mounting computational needs of human ancestors' brains in an increasingly complex social environment.

### Enculturating science: community-centric design of behavior change interactions for accelerating health impact [^115FSmMK]. Seminars in Perinatology (2015). Low credibility.

Despite significant advancements in the scientific evidence base of interventions to improve newborn survival, we have not yet been able to "bend the curve" to markedly accelerate global rates of reduction in newborn mortality. The ever-widening gap between discovery of scientific best practices and their mass adoption by families (the evidence-practice gap) is not just a matter of improving the coverage of health worker-community interactions. The design of the interactions themselves must be guided by sound behavioral science approaches such that they lead to mass adoption and impact at a large scale. The main barrier to the application of scientific approaches to behavior change is our inability to "unbox" the "black box" of family health behaviors in community settings. The authors argue that these are not black boxes, but in fact thoughtfully designed community systems that have been designed and upheld, and have evolved over many years keeping in mind a certain worldview and a common social purpose. An empathetic understanding of these community systems allows us to deconstruct the causal pathways of existing behaviors, and re-engineer them to achieve desired outcomes. One of the key reasons for the failure of interactions to translate into behavior change is our failure to recognize that the content, context, and process of interactions need to be designed keeping in mind an organized community system with a very different worldview and beliefs. In order to improve the adoption of scientific best practices by communities, we need to adapt them to their culture by leveraging existing beliefs, practices, people, context, and skills. The authors present a systems approach for community-centric design of interactions, highlighting key principles for achieving intrinsically motivated, sustained change in social norms and family health behaviors, elucidated with progressive theories from systems thinking, management sciences, cross-cultural psychology, learning and social cognition, and the behavioral sciences. These are illustrated through a case study of designing effective interactions in Shivgarh, India, that led to rapid and substantial changes in newborn health behaviors and reduction in NMR by half over a span of 16 months.

### Beliefs about moral obligation structure children's social category-based expectations [^115krFEo]. Child Development (2020). Medium credibility.

Young children view social category members as morally obligated toward one another, and expect these obligations to shape people's social behavior. The present work investigates how children specify which behaviors are constrained by social categories in this way. In two studies (N = 128), 4- and 5-year-old children predicted that morally positive behaviors would be directed toward in-group members, and that morally negative behaviors would be directed toward out-group members, but did not hold equally strong expectations about behaviors described as positive or negative for reasons irrelevant to morality. Thus, notions of morality are embedded within children's representations of social categories, such that when learning about novel moral norms, children immediately expect those obligations to uniquely hold within social groups.

### School health guidelines to promote healthy eating and physical activity [^113PZhQG]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2011). Medium credibility.

School health education curricula — consistency with scientific evidence: Health education curricula, regardless of the topic, should reflect the research that emphasizes teaching functional health information, shaping personal values that support healthy behaviors, shaping group norms that value a healthy lifestyle, and developing essential health skills necessary to adopt and maintain health-enhancing behaviors. Health education curricula and materials should be based on theories of behavior change and should focus on clear health goals and specific behavioral outcomes; be research-based and theory-driven; address individual values and group norms that support health-enhancing behaviors; address social pressures and influences; build personal competence, social competence, and increase confidence in skills; provide functional health knowledge that is basic and accurate and directly contributes to health-promoting decisions and behaviors; provide age-appropriate and developmentally appropriate information, learning strategies, teaching methods, and materials; and incorporate learning strategies, teaching methods, and materials that are culturally inclusive.

### Social learning of fear [^113z4gB5]. Nature Neuroscience (2007). Medium credibility.

Research across species highlights the critical role of the amygdala in fear conditioning. However, fear conditioning, involving direct aversive experience, is only one means by which fears can be acquired. Exploiting aversive experiences of other individuals through social fear learning is less risky. Behavioral research provides important insights into the workings of social fear learning, and the neural mechanisms are beginning to be understood. We review research suggesting that an amygdala-centered model of fear conditioning can help to explain social learning of fear through observation and instruction. We also describe how observational and instructed fear is distinguished by involvement of additional neural systems implicated in social-emotional behavior, language and explicit memory, and propose a modified conditioning model to account for social fear learning. A better understanding of social fear learning promotes integration of biological principles of learning with cultural evolution.

### A behavioral signature for quantifying the social value of interpersonal relationships with specific others [^116pMpi9]. Communications Psychology (2024). Medium credibility.

The idea that individuals ascribe value to social phenomena, broadly construed, is well-established. Despite the ubiquity of this concept, defining social value in the context of interpersonal relationships remains elusive. This is notable because while prominent theories of human social behavior acknowledge the role of value-based processes, they mostly emphasize the value of individual actions an agent may choose to take in a given environment. Comparatively little is known about how humans value their interpersonal relationships. To address this, we devised a method for engineering a behavioral signature of social value in several independent samples (total N = 1111). Incorporating the concept of opportunity cost from economics and data-driven quantitative methods, we derived this signature by sourcing and weighting a range of social behaviors based on how likely individuals are to prioritize them in the face of limited resources. We examined how strongly the signature was expressed in self-reported social behaviors with specific relationship partners (a parent, close friend, and acquaintance). Social value scores track with other aspects of these relationships (e.g. relationship quality, aversion to losing relationship partners), are predictive of decision preferences on a range of tasks, and display good psychometric properties. These results provide greater mechanistic specificity in delineating human value-based behavior in social contexts and help parse the motivational relevance of the different facets that comprise interpersonal relationships.

### A computational reward learning account of social media engagement [^112PaCbg]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Study 2: Social comparison in social reward learning

The preceding analyses showed that people dynamically adjust their social media behavior in response to their own social rewards, as predicted by reward learning theory — a theory originally developed to test the effects of nonsocial rewards (e.g. food) in solitary contexts. However, given the intrinsically social context of social media use, we speculated that reward learning online could be modulated by the rewards others receive. In the Supplementary Note 9 we provide preliminary support for the hypothesis that reward learning, at least on the social media platforms we analyzed in Study 2, may be modulated by social comparison.

Individual differences in reward learning on social media

Having established that reward learning can help explain social media behavior, we next asked whether individuals differ in the ways they learn from rewards on social media. To address this issue, we used the parameter estimates of the basicmodel as a compact but rich description of the mechanisms underlying behavior — a kind of computational phenotype (which is behavioral in nature and makes no direct reference to the underlying genotype). Individual differences in these parameters can thus be viewed as differences in computational mechanismsthat are interpretable across domains. For example, individual differences in learning rates have previously been linked to both geneticand developmental differencesbetween individuals, while individual differences in effort cost sensitivity have been related to the dopaminergic system.

More specifically, we used the three parameters of the originalmodel estimated for each individual from Study 1 & 2 (total N Users = 4,168), as input for k-means clustering, an unsupervised, data-driven method for finding sub-groups in multidimensional data. Quantitative assessment, using multiple standard criteria, showed that four clusters gave the best sub-group solution (see Fig. 4a and Methods). In Supplementary Note 10, we report additional robustness analyses, which show that this cluster solution was stable. These clusters comprised between 41% (1739 individuals) to 7% (299 individuals) of the total dataset. Importantly, although the four datasets varied in mean τ Post (as reflected in the P parameter), the cluster assignment was not strongly explained by dataset (Cramér's V = 0.3; Cramér's V is a measure of the association between two nominal variables, where 1 denotes perfect association). This indicates that clusters captured individual differences in computational learning mechanisms, rather than idiosyncrasies of social media sites.

### The effect of the model's social status on placebo analgesia induced by social observational learning [^114Y9bcA]. Pain Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Third, the fact that we did not find a difference between the HSM and LSM groups could also be explained by the nature of pain, which is a basic adaptive reaction that is common to animals and people and that informs them about potential dangers, thereby increasing the likelihood of survival. Therefore, information about painful stimulation might be important enough to arouse vigilance and influence attentional and motivational processes, regardless of the social status of the person from whom it is coming. According to social learning theory, these processes influence the efficacy of learning, which could explain why the analgesic effect was similar in both groups.

Nevertheless, our study is the first to show that the perceived social status of a model can influence the magnitude of placebo analgesia induced by observational learning. Therefore, we have confirmed and broadened the results of previous research based on social learning theory, as we have shown that the behaviors and reactions of people perceived as more powerful, influential, and wealthy are more likely to be followed by others and implemented in their behavioral repertoire; this also applies to behaviors and reactions related to pain. However, in our study, we used only a male model, as a previous study showed that observing a male model induced a greater placebo effect than observing a female model, regardless of the sex of the observer. Thus, it should be taken into account that using a female model in this study might also result in a weaker placebo effect.

### Self-utility distance as a computational approach to understanding self-concept clarity [^112yJ2yU]. Communications Psychology (2025). Medium credibility.

Drawing on insights from research in self-concept dynamics, personality psychology, and reinforcement learning, we introduce 'Self-Utility Distance' as a predictor and potential mechanism related to Self-Concept Clarity. Self-utility distance encapsulates the dissimilarity between individuals' current self-concept — comprising various personality traits such as 'Sociable' or 'Anxious' — and their subjective estimations of how these personal characteristics contribute to maximizing the rewards or avoiding the negative outcomes available in their current environments. Put simply, Self-Utility Distance reflects the distance between current self-attributes and their 'expected utility values'. As an example of high Self-Utility Distance, consider an individual who identifies strongly as being "independent" (e.g. tends to be self-reliant, tends to work autonomously, likes to do plans by herself). If this person is part of a work culture that heavily emphasizes teamwork and collaborative processes (e.g. frequent team meetings, shared projects, group work), they might perceive a low utility in their independence, seeing it as less conducive to gaining rewards (e.g. team-based bonuses, promotions) or avoiding negative outcomes (e.g. job loss). Conversely (low Self-Utility Distance), If the individual works in a setting that values autonomous work (e.g. remote work, flexible project choices), their independent nature would align closely with the environment's demands. In this context, the individual might perceive high utility in their independence, as it might enhance their ability to achieve rewards (e.g. recognition for individual contributions, opportunities for self-directed projects) and prevent negative outcomes (e.g. conflicts over team roles). Although its definition might vary slightly across fields, utility is a measure reflecting the expected cumulative rewards associated with a particular state, decision, or action. Reinforcement learning (RL) models capitalize on the notion that utility computations guide individuals' adaptation strategies by helping them select sets of behaviors (referred to as policies in RL) that maximize long-term cumulative rewards. Through interactions with their environment, individuals learn to update their utility estimates and optimize their behavior accordingly, bolstering adaptation. For example, an RL agent might learn that a more competitive strategy yields higher rewards than a cooperative one and progressively adjust its policy. In this context, difficulties in meeting environmental demands are typically seen as resulting from inadequate learning or holding an inaccurate or incomplete model of the environment. These principles share some parallels with other theories strongly focused on how biological agents update their models of the world to promote adaptation. Despite the theoretical and mathematical elegance of RL models and their successful application for explaining a multitude of phenomena, they remain limited to explaining human adaptation to real-life situations.

### Preventing gender-based violence: a global imperative [^11688Jfe]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

2 THE GROWING CRISIS OF GENDER‐BASED VIOLENCE

GBV remains a pervasive and devastating issue affecting millions of women, girls, and vulnerable groups worldwide. Almost 20 years ago, Kofi Annan, the then Secretary General of the UN, stated that VAW was probably the most shameful human rights violation. Despite ongoing efforts to address it, this statement remains terribly true: GBV persists in various forms, including physical, sexual, emotional, and psychological abuse, perpetuating inequality, fear, and violence within societies. The complexity of this issue, driven by deep‐seated gender norms and power imbalances, necessitates a multifaceted approach that involves not only policymakers but healthcare providers, social services, and communities as well.

The UN declared November 25th as the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, marking the global recognition of this human rights violation. This was followed by "Agenda 2030", approved by the UN general Assembly in 2015, where Goal 5 specifically states: "Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls". A call to accelerate progress in achieving sexual and reproductive health and rights for all and combating VAW was made in the 2018 report of the Guttmacher–Lancet Commission. Unfortunately, despite these commendable efforts, many women and girls continue to experience GBV, with limited access to resources and justice, particularly in low‐resource settings like sub‐Saharan Africaand Southeast Asia.

The persistence of GBV highlights the need for more coordinated and innovative interventions, with a special emphasis on prevention. It also requires harmonization at the scientific level between anthropology and social sciences. Anthropology suggests that men's violent behavior originates from evolution, as a legacy of the violent behavior observed in great apes (e.g. see Wrangham and Peterson). On the other hand, the social sciences, following Bandura's Social Learning Theory, tells us that violence is a learned behavior, passed down through the imitation of aggressive models. According to this theory, male humans do not inherently possess a violent nature. In other words, an environment filled with violence is neither natural nor just.

Regardless of its origin, men's violent behavior is definitely not inevitable, as there is no proof that it is the direct result of genetic influence on behavior. In addition, violent male behavior is not inevitable among primates, as shown by one of our closest relatives, the bonobo.

### Patterns of social connection among older adults in england [^111QtLJ6]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

The existence of this multitude of different social connection frameworks has led to 3 key research challenges. First, it is unclear whether different individuals display differential patterns of social connection, as previously hypothesized. Second, it is unclear whether any differences in these patterns are associated with health-related outcomes. In other words, are some patterns of social connection more strongly linked to morbidity or mortality than others? Third, given a lack of consensus about the empirical validity of one theoretical model over another, most empirical studies focused on a single or few individual concepts of social connection, rather than understanding in full detail the interrelationships between social connection components and their health impacts. As a result, the existing empirical evidence on social connection and its health impact is generally piecemeal and fragmented.

Therefore, this study aimed to provide a data-driven approach to understand social connection. Using machine learning approaches in a large representative cohort of older adults in England, we sought to identify clusters of people with similar patterns of social connection across different individual concepts and to break away from the conventional measurement approach by exploring a typology of qualitative categories. We then aimed to assess whether a novel data-driven model of social connection led to new insight into the association of social connection with different outcomes, including mental health, well-being, general health, and health behavior.

### Improving theories of health behavior&theory at a glance… [^117DDrsV]. cancercontrol.cancer.gov (2020). Medium credibility.

The literature on health behavior is large, but progress in understanding health behaviors and in learning how to encourage such actions is not always apparent. Among the activities that may be considered are training in theory development and testing for health behavior researchers, recruiting scientists with strong theory orientations to cancer behavior research, development of state-of-the-art summaries of theory-relevant topics, and better communication of opportunities for theory-focused research. Selected Past Activities Report Theory at a Glance: Application to Health Promotion and Health Behavior, describes influential theories of health-related behaviors, processes of shaping behavior, and the effects of community and environmental factors on behavior.

It complements existing resources that offer tools, techniques, and model programs for practice; and makes health behavior theory accessible and provides tools to solve problems and assess the effectiveness of health promotion programs.

### Theory-based interventions for contraception [^116qnEQH]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The explicit use of theory in research helps expand the knowledge base. Theories and models have been used extensively in HIV-prevention research and in interventions for preventing sexually transmitted infections (STIs). The health behavior field uses many theories or models of change. However, many educational interventions addressing contraception have no explicit theoretical base.

Objectives

To review randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that tested a theoretical approach to inform contraceptive choice and encourage or improve contraceptive use.

Search Methods

To 1 November 2016, we searched for trials that tested a theory-based intervention for improving contraceptive use in PubMed, CENTRAL, POPLINE, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, and ICTRP. For the initial review, we wrote to investigators to find other trials.

Selection Criteria

Included trials tested a theory-based intervention for improving contraceptive use. Interventions addressed the use of one or more methods for contraception. The reports provided evidence that the intervention was based on a specific theory or model. The primary outcomes were pregnancy and contraceptive choice or use.

Data Collection and Analysis

We assessed titles and abstracts identified during the searches. One author extracted and entered the data into Review Manager; a second author verified accuracy. We examined studies for methodological quality. For unadjusted dichotomous outcomes, we calculated the Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Cluster randomized trials used various methods of accounting for the clustering, such as multilevel modeling. Most reports did not provide information to calculate the effective sample size. Therefore, we presented the results as reported by the investigators. We did not conduct meta-analysis due to varied interventions and outcome measures.

Main Results

We included 10 new trials for a total of 25. Five were conducted outside the USA. Fifteen randomly assigned individuals and 10 randomized clusters. This section focuses on nine trials with high or moderate quality evidence and an intervention effect. Five based on social cognitive theory addressed preventing adolescent pregnancy and were one to two years long. The comparison was usual care or education. Adolescent mothers with a home-based curriculum had fewer second births in two years (OR 0.41, 95% CI 0.17 to 1.00). Twelve months after a school-based curriculum, the intervention group was more likely to report using an effective contraceptive method (adjusted OR 1.76 ± standard error (SE) 0.29) and using condoms during last intercourse (adjusted OR 1.68 ± SE 0.25). In alternative schools, after five months the intervention group reported more condom use during last intercourse (reported adjusted OR 2.12, 95% CI 1.24 to 3.56). After a school-based risk-reduction program, at three months the intervention group was less likely to report no condom use at last intercourse (adjusted OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.96). The risk avoidance group (abstinence-focused) was less likely to do so at 15 months (OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.85). At 24 months after a case management and peer-leadership program, the intervention group reported more consistent use of hormonal contraceptives (adjusted relative risk (RR) 1.30, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.58), condoms (RR 1.57, 95% CI 1.28 to 1.94), and dual methods (RR 1.36, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.85). Four of the nine trials used motivational interviewing (MI). In three studies, the comparison group received handouts. The MI group more often reported effective contraception use at nine months (OR 2.04, 95% CI 1.47 to 2.83). In two studies, the MI group was less likely to report using ineffective contraception at three months (OR 0.31, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.77) and four months (OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.98), respectively. In the fourth trial, the MI group was more likely than a group with non-standard counseling to initiate long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) by one month (OR 3.99, 95% CI 1.36 to 11.68) and to report using LARC at three months (OR 3.38, 95% CI 1.06 to 10.71).

Authors' Conclusions

The overall quality of evidence was moderate. Trials based on social cognitive theory focused on adolescents and provided multiple sessions. Those using motivational interviewing had a wider age range but specific populations. Sites with low resources need effective interventions adapted for their settings and their typical clients. Reports could be clearer about how the theory was used to design and implement the intervention.

### Game theoretical inference of human behavior in social networks [^114Q9TKy]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Social networks emerge as a result of actors' linking decisions. We propose a game-theoretical model of socio-strategic network formation on directed weighted graphs, in which every actors' benefit is a parametric trade-off between centrality measure, brokerage opportunities, clustering coefficient, and sociological network patterns. We use two different stability definitions to infer individual behavior of homogeneous, rational agents from network structure, and to quantify the impact of cooperation. Our theoretical analysis confirms results known for specific network motifs studied previously in isolation, yet enables us to precisely quantify the trade-offs in the space of user preferences. To deal with complex networks of heterogeneous and irrational actors, we construct a statistical behavior estimation method using Nash equilibrium conditions. We provide evidence that our results are consistent with empirical, historical, and sociological observations on real-world data-sets. Furthermore, our method offers sociological and strategic interpretations of random networks models, such as preferential attachment and small-world networks.

### Development of tools to study personal weight control strategies: OxFAB taxonomy [^115fSzdg]. Obesity (2016). Low credibility.

Results

Taxonomy

One additional domain was added during the process of mapping behavior change taxonomies and theories onto the taxonomy. Prompted by social cognitive theory and learning theories, imitation (modeling) was added. Through discussions with colleagues, 11 additional strategies were also added. Accordingly, the OxFAB taxonomy (version 1) consists of 117 strategies grouped into 23 domains. The list, with definitions and an example strategy can be found in Table 3. The full list of strategies, grouped by domain, can be found in Supporting Information Table S1. The systematic review resulted in minor changes to the coding manual to clarify definitions and examples, but did not uncover previously unidentified strategies, and did not result in substantive changes to the content of the taxonomy. The initial coding yielded a list of 103 strategies.

Compared with existing taxonomies, there was some direct overlap, for example, self‐monitoring 7, 8. Of the 23 domains, 13 included strategies which could not be mapped onto existing taxonomies. When mapped against the most recent, 93‐item behavior change technique taxonomy 7, approximately half of the OxFAB strategies could not be mapped directly on to the behavior change technique taxonomy (see Supporting Information Table S3). Three OxFAB strategies overlapped exactly with techniques from the BCT taxonomy (e.g. "Pledge/agree to contract regarding your weight loss targets" is conceptually the same as BCT 1.8 Behavioral contract), 54 OxFAB strategies provided grounded examples of BCT techniques from the perspective of the participant (e.g. "Measure the amount of physical activity you do" is a grounded example of BCT 2.3 Self‐monitoring of behavior), 23 OxFAB strategies did not map onto any specific techniques but were related to concepts present in the BCT taxonomy (e.g. "Enhance accountability to buddy" is related to BCT category 3, Social support), and 37 OxFAB strategies were not related to concepts itemized in the BCT taxonomy, usually because of their specificity to weight loss (e.g. "Eat slowly".) The strategies in the OxFAB taxonomy tended to be more detailed and specific than the items in the BCT taxonomy, reflecting the different aims of the two taxonomies.

### A behavioral signature for quantifying the social value of interpersonal relationships with specific others [^114u6eo3]. Communications Psychology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The goal of this study was to develop and validate a behavioral signature of social value that could be applied to quantify the value of interpersonal relationships. Using a definition of social value rooted in economic concepts of scarcity and opportunity cost, we devised and implemented a method that calculates the social value of interpersonal relationships by examining how likely individuals are to complete highly prioritized activities with a given relationship partner. Our method of engineering a behavioral signature of social value produced scores that tracked with self-reported relationship quality, social loss aversion, and patterns of behavior towards specific social partners on social decision-making tasks. Crucially, these findings do not appear to be driven by mere time spent (actual or ideal) with familiar others, as our social value scores were largely uncorrelated with these metrics. Our results have wide-ranging implications for theories in the behavioral sciences.

These results complement the vast literature on value-based human behavior. Prominent theories posit that human behavior is guided by cognitive and affective heuristics that compute the subjective value of prospective actions, and the action that maximizes subjective value is then enacted –. These theories thus place an emphasis on the subjective value of individual actions. Our work could help enrich these theories by showing that individuals assign value to specific agents in their social environment. This would allow for a more comprehensive understanding of how different elements of one's environment shape value appraisals for specific actions. This promises to provide additional mechanistic specificity to these theories by enabling researchers to partition the value of a prospective action into its constituent components (e.g. how much of a given action's value comes from the value of the relationship partner or from other features of the action). The potential for enhanced mechanistic specificity is not only relevant for basic theory, but also has practical applications, such as for advancing understanding of how value-based processes are disrupted in psychiatric illnesses.

### Testing the reinforcement learning hypothesis of social conformity [^111bQbJ7]. Human Brain Mapping (2021). Medium credibility.

However, importantly, there are at least two reasons to believe that the hypothesis is too simplistic. First, in the context of the original social conformity task (Klucharev et al. 2009), the idea that social conflict is the same as prediction error implies that participants expect that the group's rating is always the same as their ratings, which seems highly unlikely. In fact, using a similar social conformity paradigm, we had previously asked participants to guess the group ratings, but their expectations of group ratings were not related to their own ratings (Izuma & Adolphs, 2013). In other words, the social conformity task was not perceived as a learning task (i.e. learning preferences of a group) by participants. If so, underlying computations are likely to be different between social conformity and reinforcement learning. Second, another important difference is that while striatal activity is positively related to signed prediction error during the reinforcement learning task (i.e. actual vs. expected rewards), it is negatively related to social conflict during the social conformity task (i.e. the absolute difference between one's vs. group's rating). This negative correlation with social conflict in the social conformity task corresponds to a negative correlation with unsigned prediction error in the reinforcement learning task (i.e. the absolute difference between actual vs. expected rewards). Thus, although the same striatal region is involved in both tasks, signals related to its activity are conceptually different between the two tasks.

The reinforcement learning hypothesis of social conformity suggests an interesting possibility of bridging two previously‐unrelated literatures of neuroscience research on reinforcement learning and psychology research on social conformity and could significantly advance the understandings of the neural and psychological mechanisms of how we are influenced by others. However, while the reinforcement‐learning hypothesis is currently most widely accepted as the neural mechanism of social conformity (Campbell‐Meiklejohn et al. 2012; Chen et al. 2012; Izuma, 2013, 2017; Kim et al. 2012; Klucharev et al. 2009; Shestakova et al. 2012), to the best of our knowledge, these two processes have never been directly compared to each other. Thus, evidence in support of a common neural mechanism is still insufficient. Thus, the aim of this study was to rigorously test the reinforcement learning hypothesis of social conformity by asking the same sample of participants to perform social conformity and reinforcement learning tasks inside an fMRI scanner.

### The development of human social learning across seven societies [^1166kbjU]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Social information use is a pivotal characteristic of the human species. Avoiding the cost of individual exploration, social learning confers substantial fitness benefits under a wide variety of environmental conditions, especially when the process is governed by biases toward relative superiority (e.g. experts, the majority). Here, we examine the development of social information use in children aged 4–14 years (n = 605) across seven societies in a standardised social learning task. We measured two key aspects of social information use: general reliance on social information and majority preference. We show that the extent to which children rely on social information depends on children's cultural background. The extent of children's majority preference also varies cross-culturally, but in contrast to social information use, the ontogeny of majority preference follows a U-shaped trajectory across all societies. Our results demonstrate both cultural continuity and diversity in the realm of human social learning.

### The development of BE-EMPOWERed: Belgian program enhancing the uptake and effectiveness of a multifactorial falls prevention intervention in older community-dWElling peRsons [^113iQ6U6]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Step 3: program design

In the third step of IM, the program's components, scope, sequence, theory- and evidence based implementation strategies and practical applications of the BE-EMPOWERed program were defined based on the findings of Step 1 and 2 of IM.

The following key insights from the two systematic reviews and qualitative study were considered in designing the BE-EMPOWERed program:

Multilevel approach: Implementation strategies should target multiple determinants across different levels and promote interactions between them.
Empowerment of older people: Encouraging active participation and self-management in falls prevention is essential for long-term sustainability.
Knowledge and motivation: Raising awareness, enhancing beliefs, and building skills among both healthcare professionals and older people is key.
Collaboration and coalition-building: Engaging stakeholders throughout both development and implementation phases strengthens long-term sustainability.

Table 3 gives an overview of the selected implementation strategies and related behavior change theories at the level of the older person and healthcare professional. These strategies and theories were translated into program components, consisting of a group program for older people and workshops for healthcare professionals.

Table 3
Overview implementation strategies and related behavior change theories for older person and healthcare professional

1. Group program

The group program draws inspiration from the Australian multifactorial falls prevention program 'Stepping On', and aligns with strategies identified in the first two steps of IM: tailoring (i.e. matching the intervention to characteristics of the participant), personalizing risk (i.e. providing information about falls risks and intervention), active learning (i.e. encouraging learning from goal-driven and activity-based experience), participation (i.e. assuring high level engagement of the participants' group in decision making, prioritizing and change activities) and mobilizing social support (i.e. prompting communication about behavior change in order to provide instrumental and emotional social support).

Stepping On is a multifaceted program aiming to empower older people to take control and incorporates falls prevention interventions into their everyday lives using a small-group learning environment. Stepping On has shown positive outcomes, i.e. increasing levels of independence, enabling a proactive approach to health and a 30% reduction in falls in a randomized controlled trial.

### Prevention of type 2 diabetes in young people: a theoretical perspective [^111jsjdr]. Pediatric Diabetes (2003). Low credibility.

Type 2 diabetes in youth is an increasing public health concern, especially in certain minority populations. The current paper consists of four sections. First, we establish the significance of the problem by presenting an overview of epidemiological and physiological evidence. Second, we discuss behavioral issues relevant to the prevention of type 2 diabetes in youth. Third, a qualitative review of existing prevention interventions specific to type 2 diabetes in youth is presented. Results suggest that modest improvements in social cognitive, dietary, and exercise outcomes are possible with diabetes intervention studies, although beneficial changes are difficult to sustain over the long term. Although theoretical frameworks are not always explicit, most studies have utilized elements of the social cognitive theory. Less attention has been paid to sociocultural and community organization variables. Finally, the paper discusses issues of risk definition and intervention sustainability, and presents a comprehensive, theoretically diverse model for the prevention of type 2 diabetes in youth. In summary, we suggest that theories of the natural history and pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes are important to identify modifiable risk factors, while theories of behavioral change are essential to modify the risk factors identified. The combination of sound physiological and behavioral theories should form the basis of prevention intervention design. In addition, an ecologic approach that takes into consideration the dynamic interactions of personal, social, and environmental factors would best promote the long-term adoption of healthful behaviors in a supportive, meaningful, and personally enjoyable context.

### The role of the pediatrician in the promotion of healthy, active living [^116Mz7wE]. Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Social determinants of health — definition, scope, and influence are outlined, stating that social determinants of health (SDOHs) are the conditions in the environment where children are born, live, learn, work, play, and worship that affect a wide range of health and quality of life outcomes, that SDOHs affect everyone and may be supportive or detrimental, warrant special consideration as they impact and may be addressed at every level of the socioecological model, and heavily influence health behaviors, including nutrition, physical activity, sleep, screen use, and social and emotional wellness, while being impacted most by upstream institutional, community, and policy factors; examples include economic stability and factors, such as education, income, employment, poverty, and food insecurity, and social and community context, including support systems and nurturing relationships and community engagement.

### The development of human social learning across seven societies [^112io51n]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Lastly, the sex differences trend in social information use, especially with respect to the majority preference: Our finding that boys tended to follow the majority more markedly than girls did contrasts with existing literature on conformity sensu the Asch studies. Within this seminal conformity framework, females (both juveniles and adults) are found to acquiesce to the majority more than males, which has been linked to lower levels of self-reported confidence in one's own judgement. Note, however, the distinction between conforming against better knowledge and conforming in order to obtain a new behavioural variant. While the former is associated with social pressure and with the aforementioned sex bias, the latter does not require the forfeiting of an established notion or preference and is, as such, more relevantly linked to (adaptive) decision-making. Importantly, the latter conformity type has, to our knowledge, not been investigated with a focus on sex differences. Hence, our study provides a first indication that boys are more biased towards following the majority in adopting novel behaviours than girls are.

Our findings uniquely evidence both the cultural malleability and cross-culturally recurrent features of the developing human mind. As explanation for finding both cultural variation and continuity in the realm of human social learning, we suggest that the extent to which social information is relied upon might be strongly influenced by society-specific affordances, while the specific bias to prefer the majority might emerge from more generic principles of homophilyand optimal decision-making. For instance, societies could differ in the extent to which potential costs of individual exploration (e.g. in terms of time and effort)can be buffered (e.g. by social security), which would affect reliance on social information, but not the relative superiority (in terms of informational value) of the majority over the minority. The systematic titration of the impact of societies' characteristics on social information use is an exciting avenue for future research and could provide important insights into the socio-ecological correlates of the emergence of human culture.

### Agent-based modeling for psychological research on social phenomena [^114JFtxV]. The American Psychologist (2025). Medium credibility.

This article describes seven potential benefits of incorporating agent-based modeling (ABM) as a core research methodology for psychological research on social phenomena: building formal theories of complex social systems, validating multilevel causation, understanding temporal and nonlinear dynamics, demonstrating the completeness of theories, balancing consideration of people with their environments, bridging psychology and policy, and identifying unknown unknowns and the limits of prediction. Those benefits accrue from a resonance between how they approach questions and the questions they ask. For example, both rely on experiments to explore how individual interactions generate collective phenomena. The article compares micromechanism-driven and macropattern-driven ABM paradigms and introduces a new research approach-the minimal society paradigm-and a modeling strategy, principle-oriented modeling. This framework integrates ABM into psychological research, supporting both theory building through minimal societies and adaptation to specific contexts. Last, recent methodological developments in this field are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved).

### An overview of survey research [^116pP54i]. Respiratory Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Surveys provide evidence for the social sciences for knowledge, attitudes, and other behaviors, and, in health care, to quantify qualitative research and to assist in policymaking. A survey-designed research project is about asking questions of individuals, and, from the answers, the researcher can generalize the findings from a sample of respondents to a population. Therefore, this overview can serve as a guide to conducting survey research that can provide answers for practitioners, educators, and leaders, but only if the right questions and methods are used. The main advantage of using surveys is their economical access to participants online. A major disadvantage of survey research is the low response rates in most situations. Online surveys have many limitations that should be expected before conducting a search, and then described after the survey is complete. Any conclusions and recommendations are to be supported by evidence in a clear and objective manner. Presenting evidence in a structured format is crucial but well-developed reporting guidelines are needed for researchers who conduct survey research.

### Learning auditory discriminations from observation is efficient but less robust than learning from experience [^111vFNoU]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Our work raises many interesting questions on the behavioral and neurobiological mechanisms used by observers to acquire stimulus-discriminative information. Behaviorally, observers could learn through social mechanisms of action imitation, of observational conditioning, and of stimulus enhancement, or a combination of these. Note that the definitions of these mechanisms are not strict enough to allow a discrete categorization of social learning in any one study. Our findings de-emphasize some known social learning mechanisms such as perceptual learning (evidenced by PL learners) and simple stimulus enhancement (evidenced by lack of discriminative behavior during pre-testing, Supplementary Figure 3). Our experiments also de-emphasize vocal communication as a mechanism but reveal the importance of vision (-TCOM learners). Overall, the importance of a demonstrating expert suggests that experimenters signal statistical differences between puffed and unpuffed stimuli via their perching behavior such as their rates of leaving the perch. Possibly, observers focused their attention more on the diverse actions of experimenters and their relationships with the stimuli, which is why observers apparently failed to identify the simplest environmental signal that can explain experimenters' behavior, which in our case was syllable duration.

### Social heuristics shape intuitive cooperation [^111diGtb]. Nature Communications (2014). Medium credibility.

Cooperation is central to human societies. Yet relatively little is known about the cognitive underpinnings of cooperative decision making. Does cooperation require deliberate self-restraint? Or is spontaneous prosociality reined in by calculating self-interest? Here we present a theory of why (and for whom) intuition favors cooperation: cooperation is typically advantageous in everyday life, leading to the formation of generalized cooperative intuitions. Deliberation, by contrast, adjusts behaviour towards the optimum for a given situation. Thus, in one-shot anonymous interactions where selfishness is optimal, intuitive responses tend to be more cooperative than deliberative responses. We test this 'social heuristics hypothesis' by aggregating across every cooperation experiment using time pressure that we conducted over a 2-year period (15 studies and 6,910 decisions), as well as performing a novel time pressure experiment. Doing so demonstrates a positive average effect of time pressure on cooperation. We also find substantial variation in this effect, and show that this variation is partly explained by previous experience with one-shot lab experiments.

### Simple behavioral analysis (simBA) as a platform for explainable machine learning in behavioral neuroscience [^111Axpdm]. Nature Neuroscience (2024). High credibility.

The study of complex behaviors is often challenging when using manual annotation due to the absence of quantifiable behavioral definitions and the subjective nature of behavioral annotation. Integration of supervised machine learning approaches mitigates some of these issues through the inclusion of accessible and explainable model interpretation. To decrease barriers to access, and with an emphasis on accessible model explainability, we developed the open-source Simple Behavioral Analysis (SimBA) platform for behavioral neuroscientists. SimBA introduces several machine learning interpretability tools, including SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) scores, that aid in creating explainable and transparent behavioral classifiers. Here we show how the addition of explainability metrics allows for quantifiable comparisons of aggressive social behavior across research groups and species, reconceptualizing behavior as a sharable reagent and providing an open-source framework. We provide an open-source, graphical user interface (GUI)-driven, well-documented package to facilitate the movement toward improved automation and sharing of behavioral classification tools across laboratories.

### A behavioural science framework for tackling upstream challenges in health systems [^114zigwA]. BMJ Global Health (2025). High credibility.

Application of behavioural science to upstream challenges

We outline an analytical framework for applying behavioural science to upstream challenges in health systems (see figure 1) that (1) guides the distillation of a health system challenge into concrete, addressable behaviours and (2) illustrates questions for investigating how factors in the context influence each such behaviour. This framework draws insight from several existing theories related to decision-making. The complexity of health systems challenges means that many challenges arise from a constellation of behaviours involving different actors. The complexity of human behaviour means that for each behaviour, multiple drivers are likely relevant.

Figure 1
Framework for Applying Behavioral Science to Upstream Challenges.

The framework is meant to be used by stakeholders working to strengthen health systems. It may offer a useful tool for self-reflection by government officials and other actors within a system on their own actions. However, its greatest value is likely to result from application by stakeholders within or outside the system who can institute changes that impact an array of inter-related behaviours.

This framework guides users to start with behaviours, avoiding assumptions about what might be driving a problem or what a solution must entail. It offers a structure for carefully considering and investigating how the context surrounding the people who comprise a system shapes their behaviour, which in turn determines the system-level outcomes. Features of this context include, for example, the structural constraints, information, social cues and physical environment an actor encounters; the context very often results from behaviour of others in the system.

The framework stops short of prescribing specific solutions, which must be determined by what in the context is shaping the prioritised behaviours. Instead, it aims to provide clarity and specificity about what a solution must achieve to address the challenge. Although it appears linear, its application may often be iterative, as insights into the drivers of one behaviour shed light on other relevant behaviours warranting investigation. Similarly, a behaviour that at first glance appears immovable due to structural constraints may, in fact, be possible when those constraints are eased by changing another behaviour elsewhere in the system.

### Neural implementation of computational mechanisms underlying the continuous trade-off between cooperation and competition [^111DvV6t]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Over the last decade there has been a shift in focus towards identifying the computational mechanisms that guide social behaviour. Much of this work has begun to show that models based around reinforcement learning and Bayesian principles may provide the framework that scaffolds social information processing. Previous work has identified social prediction errors that underlie prosocial behaviour, teaching, trust, mentalizing, false belief processing, and a range of other processing requiring social learning. Our results concord with the notion that Bayesian principles and prediction errors can guide social behaviour and socio-cognitive processes.

In this work, we developed an economic game that generalizes the Prisoner's Dilemma, into a continuous measure and reproduce a well-known economic principle of locational equilibrium in duopoly described in the Hotelling law. On a broader level this work converges two lines of research exploring social behaviour, work in behavioural economics using economic games, with those arguing that human decision-making may be best understood with approaches from foraging theory. In fact, the task could also be framed as a foraging problem where one had to position oneself in a location. The co-player was likely to be treated as a potential 'predator' in the competitive context when the reward of a player correspond to a loss for the co-player, but not in the cooperative one, with such behavioural flexibility linked to mPFC responses. Such findings relate to research which has suggested that activity in several mPFC sub-regions may be encoding the proximity of threats in the environment. Our results somewhat concord with this notion, but suggest that rather than proximity to threat, several mPFC regions are involved in integrating one's overall preference for cooperativeness, the changes in social context and information about the actions of the other player. All of these signals are necessary to identify where a player will position themselves, as well as being processes responsible for judging where the other player will position themselves. As such, these regions may be engaged when potentially close to threats by processing information that allows one to adapt behaviours accordingly.

### A computational reward learning account of social media engagement [^113mK6kg]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Naturally, there are many possible reasons for posting on social media in addition to reward seeking, ranging from self-expression to relational development. While our research focused on how social rewards explain behavior, it does not preclude the potentially important roles of other motivations. Incorporating relational considerations in themodel, such as reciprocity or network proximity, represents an important goal for future research. Nevertheless, the learning model tested here explained behavior well, suggesting that reward learning is a major factor in social media engagement.

Our results raise several new questions regarding the role of reward in social media behavior. First, while our analysis of anonymous, real-world social media data precluded demographic characterization of users, it is possible that certain demographic factors, such as age, may moderate the effect of reward learning in online behavior. For example, adolescents tend to be more sensitive than adults to social rewards and punishments, and thus our results may be particularly informative to questions of adolescent social media behavior. An examination of the developmental trajectories of the computational phenotypes in social reward learning identified here, and their relations to individual differences in psychological traits, could further illuminate age effects in online behavior. Furthermore, while our research focused on the effect of social rewards (i.e. likes) on posting behavior, negative feedback, which is rampant on many social media platforms (e.g. down votes), is also likely to drive learning. The RL framework we proposed here may also be extended to include such social punishments. For example, treating social punishments as reinforcement with negative utility would, in principle, allow direct application of themodel in its current form, but it is possible that additional motivational factors, such as negative reciprocity, also play an important role in aversely motivated social media behavior. In addition, as we focused on the timing, rather than the content (e.g. of images or comments), of social media posts, an important future goal will be to characterize how people learn to produce actions (e.g. posting content, comments on others' posts) that maximize reward. Ourmodel could be modified to include action selection as a part of the response policy. Finally, our analysis in Study 2 suggests that social comparison may contribute to reward learning on social media by providing a social reference level for the number of likes required to elicit a positive reward prediction error. Although this result comports with prior research examining social comparison on social media, as well as neural reward processing, the correlational nature of the big data used here necessitates caution, as other explanations cannot be ruled out. These findings present an opportunity for future experimental research to establish the causal nature of social comparison and to explore its boundary conditions.

### When complexity science meets implementation science: a theoretical and empirical analysis of systems change [^1169pyh1]. BMC Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Implementation science has a core aim - to get evidence into practice. Early in the evidence-based medicine movement, this task was construed in linear terms, wherein the knowledge pipeline moved from evidence created in the laboratory through to clinical trials and, finally, via new tests, drugs, equipment, or procedures, into clinical practice. We now know that this straight-line thinking was naïve at best, and little more than an idealization, with multiple fractures appearing in the pipeline.

Discussion

The knowledge pipeline derives from a mechanistic and linear approach to science, which, while delivering huge advances in medicine over the last two centuries, is limited in its application to complex social systems such as healthcare. Instead, complexity science, a theoretical approach to understanding interconnections among agents and how they give rise to emergent, dynamic, systems-level behaviors, represents an increasingly useful conceptual framework for change. Herein, we discuss what implementation science can learn from complexity science, and tease out some of the properties of healthcare systems that enable or constrain the goals we have for better, more effective, more evidence-based care. Two Australian examples, one largely top-down, predicated on applying new standards across the country, and the other largely bottom-up, adopting medical emergency teams in over 200 hospitals, provide empirical support for a complexity-informed approach to implementation. The key lessons are that change can be stimulated in many ways, but a triggering mechanism is needed, such as legislation or widespread stakeholder agreement; that feedback loops are crucial to continue change momentum; that extended sweeps of time are involved, typically much longer than believed at the outset; and that taking a systems-informed, complexity approach, having regard for existing networks and socio-technical characteristics, is beneficial.

Conclusion

Construing healthcare as a complex adaptive system implies that getting evidence into routine practice through a step-by-step model is not feasible. Complexity science forces us to consider the dynamic properties of systems and the varying characteristics that are deeply enmeshed in social practices, whilst indicating that multiple forces, variables, and influences must be factored into any change process, and that unpredictability and uncertainty are normal properties of multi-part, intricate systems.

### Exposure to violence affects the development of moral impressions and trust behavior in incarcerated males [^116NmE5L]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Exposure to violence predisposes some individuals to diverse forms of negative life experiences and mental health problems, as well as comprises a prominent risk factor for a lifetime mired in aggression. Chronic exposure to violence, whether in a larger community or justice system context, shapes cognition in a way that is likely to distort perceptions of what is considered harmful behavior and how to react to harmful behavior. However, the precise social cognitive processes that may underlie these distortions in individuals exposed to violence is unclear. At the core of several theories about the relationship between exposure to violence and aggressive/antisocial behavior is the role of learning. However, empirical evidence identifying and specifying the way in which learning is disrupted and can affect behavior in individuals exposed to violence remains elusive.

One aspect of learning that is especially relevant to adaptive social behavior is learning about whether other individuals might harm us. Harmfulness is a core dimension of moral character. Research on social learning has shown that there are two, distinct, components of harmfulness learning. On the one hand, people use social cues to objectively update their beliefs about others' harmfulness by gradually accumulating information over time to predict future outcomes (i.e. in a Bayesian manner). On the other hand, people form subjective impressions about moral character that emerge rapidly and effortlessly. These beliefs and moral impressions are used to adaptively learn and decide whom to trust in social interactions. For example, in a study by Siegel and colleagues, participants entrusted more money to agents who were less willing to harm others for profit and ascribed better moral character (subjective impression) to those agents compared to agents who were more willing to harm for profit. Together, these components of learning about other's harmfulness serve as powerful informational tools; for the purpose of survival, humans are evolutionarily inclined to identify potential foes and avoid them through adaptive social decision-making. However, life experiences, such as exposure to violence that for some individuals follows them continuously from the community to prison, are likely to shape social learning and resulting social behaviors. Prior research linking exposure to violence to normalized views of aggression and aberrations in interpersonal functioning raises the possibility that exposure to violence may impact learning about the harmfulness of others, and by extension, behaviors that rely on trust. To date, however, there has been no research on exposure to violence and harm learning.

### The role of the pediatrician in primary prevention of obesity [^1118nj5B]. Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

Pediatric obesity prevention — behavior-modification techniques — behavior-modification programs built on strong theoretical models have long been shown to be the best option for obesity treatment, both in adults and children, and behavioral theories used effectively for obesity treatment include the learning theory/operant conditioning, social learning/social cognitive theory, the behavioral economics theory, and the social-ecological model; however, less evidence exists to support their use in primary prevention. Most behavior-modification programs include a component of environmental change, also known as "stimulus control", which eliminates food triggers and has been effective in obesity prevention in the school setting. Changing the food that is available at home may help children make healthier choices and limit arguments about food. To assist such reviews, it may be helpful to ask families to bring grocery store receipts, prepare a list of food items easily available to the child in the house, or e-mail or text pictures of the refrigerator, the kitchen counter, and pantry that can be reviewed together on the office computer, and this can be a good arena for partnership with a dietitian and/ or a role for other office professionals or group visits.

### Active ingredients of substance use-focused self-help groups [^114bF8jo]. Addiction (2008). Low credibility.

Aims and Methods

This paper provides an overview of some of the probable active ingredients of self-help groups in light of four related theories that identify common social processes that appear to underlie effective psychosocial treatments for and continuing remission from these disorders.

Results

Social control theory specifies active ingredients such as bonding, goal direction and structure; social learning theory specifies the importance of norms and role models, behavioral economics and behavioral choice theory emphasizes involvement in rewarding activities other than substance use, and stress and coping theory highlights building self-efficacy and effective coping skills. A review of existing studies suggests that the emphasis on these active ingredients probably underlies some aspects of the effectiveness of self-help groups.

Conclusions

Several issues that need to be addressed to enhance understanding of the active ingredients of action of self-help groups are discussed, including consideration of indices of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) affiliation as active ingredients, identification of personal characteristics that may moderate the influence of active ingredients on substance use outcomes, examination of whether active ingredients of self-help groups, can amplify or compensate for treatment, identification of potential detrimental effects of involvement in self-help groups and focusing on the link between active ingredients of self-help groups and other aspects of the overall recovery milieu, such as the family and social networks.

### Evidence-based kernels: fundamental units of behavioral influence [^114Pd8A2]. Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review (2008). Low credibility.

Kernels Altering Behavior Through Antecedents

Many kernels work by establishing the functions of antecedents to behavior. A common example in schools is teachers establishing signals to guide transitions (Marion and Muza; Rosenkoetter and Fowler; West et al.). For example, many teachers turn lights off and on to signal students to return to their seats and become quiet and attentive. Of course, positive consequences (e.g. praise) are involved in establishing effectiveness of the stimulus, but once established, the salient feature is the influence of the light on the behavior.

Assigning students meaningful roles (Rutter), such as setting up equipment for an assembly, taking roll, or taking photographs for communicating desirable school functions, are activities that organize useful behavior. Antecedents may also include organized playground activities to reduce aggressive behavior and occasion various social competencies (Murphy et al.). Reinforcement follows naturally from the enactment of the role.

It would be arbitrary to classify antecedent interventions based upon whether they increase or decrease behavior. This is because antecedents that prompt a desired behavior simultaneously make troublesome behavior less likely.

Kernels Altering Behavior by Influencing Relational Responding

Tradition within psychology suggests it is unfeasible to deal with cognitive and emotional influences on behavior within a basic behavioral framework of antecedents and consequences. However, recent work on relational frame theory (Hayes et al.) has shown that human cognitive and verbal behavior can be understood in terms of basic operant processes, while honoring that humans do appear to have unique evolutionarily selected brain structures supporting language. To the extent this is true, it provides a parsimonious account of complex human functioning within a contextualist framework focusing on manipulable influences on behavior (Biglan and Hayes).

### Conceptual framework of mentoring in low-and middle-income countries to advance global health [^111pjmZ1]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2019). Medium credibility.

Tenets of mentorship.

Conversations about mentoring are relatively new in health sciences literature and it is important to consider elements from student development and career guidance literature when proposing a framework to guide trainee learning. Conceptual models have been proposed in student development since the 1960s and continue to develop as higher education disaggregates student populations to gather more nuanced data about individual growth. Early theories followed psychological theories of development, which suggested that students develop in linear or sequential stages. These theories attempted to answer questions related to what end student development is directed and what skills are necessary to address complex problems in society. These include intellectual capacities, values, types of learning, ways to foster lifelong learning, and participating in the global community.

The field of student development has evolved from linear models to focus more on how environmental factors might influence development. Most theories share assumptions about the social construction of identity and the importance of considering environmental influences or context as a complex system that affects behavior, attitudes, and cognition. This focus on learning environment places responsibilities on the institutions of learning, although the individual student remains at the center of many of these models.

Many of these student development frameworks focus on undergraduate students, not graduate or professional students. In graduate and professional schools, the additional component of socialization is an important factor that needs to be taken into consideration. Socialization occurs when the student integrates with the culture, values, and norms of a profession and is "the processes through which individuals gain the knowledge, skills, and values necessary for successful entry into a professional career requiring the advanced level of specialized knowledge and skills". In the health sciences, where apprenticeship is the primary model of education, there has been particular emphasis on the importance of this form of socialization. While considering mentoring in LMIC settings, it is important to retain socialization as an integral part of the conceptual model.

### Appendix I: understanding what drives behavior change… [^114ApfbN]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

At a glance A list of models and theories that describe what drives behavior change. Behavior Change Models Behavior change models can give you a decision-making framework for your campaign strategy, development, and call to action. There are many behavior change models to choose from. In this playbook, we're featuring just three of them, but others may be a good fit too. For more models to consider, take a look at this NIH resource Social and Behavioral Theories. Select a behavior change model that will be helpful as you make campaign design decisions. Based on your selection, complete. Exercise 6A or 6B Brainstorm Book. These exercises will pinpoint how your audience fits within the behavior change model. This decision will help you determine effective strategies and a call to action. Health Belief Model The Health Belief Mode l explains that six components predict a person's readiness to make a behavior change.

Components include perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, perceived benefits, perceived barriers, cues to action, and self-efficacy. As an example: Social Cognitive Theory The Social Cognitive Theory emphasizes the role of observational learning, social influences, and self-efficacy in behavior change. It proposes that people learn new behaviors by observing others and receiving positive or negative reinforcement for their actions. A call to action informed by this theory may influence behavior by enhancing the campaign audience member's perceived self-efficacy or helping them rethink how others around them will react if they talk about their suicidal ideation. Learn more about the Social Cognitive Theory. The Transtheoretical Model The Transtheoretical Model posits that a person moves through six stages of change: precontemplation, contemplation, preparation, action, maintenance, and termination.

For each stage, different intervention strategies are most effective at moving the person to the next stage of change. The goal is to get the person through each stage to maintenance, the ideal stage of behavior. You may want to consider suicide specific theories such as Thomas Joiner's Interpersonal Theory of Suicide. ' The theory suggests that "perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness" – or the belief in being a burden and feeling disconnected from others – coupled with the access to lethal means of suicide may contribute to suicide. Thinking about this suicide theory may help you identify where how to apply your behavior change model.

### A behavioural science framework for tackling upstream challenges in health systems [^116Yu8NZ]. BMJ Global Health (2025). High credibility.

Phase 1: distill the system-level challenge into priority behaviours

Behavioural science offers insights into what drives behaviour; to apply it to health system challenges, it is necessary first to distill those challenges into one or more priority behaviours. This can be done systematically in four steps:

Identify an outcome of interest

The outcome should typically be defined broadly–to decrease maternal mortality or to reduce inequity in service access, for example. The answer to the question 'how will I define success from this effort?' guides application of the framework to where a behavioural approach may be most impactful.

Describe changes within the system that create a pathway to achieve the outcome

In some instances where programme or policy goals are narrowly defined, this pathway may be apparent from the outset, for example, decreasing the frequency of stock-outs of a commodity, increasing resource allocation to a community health initiative or facilitating adoption of a high-impact practice. In other cases, a range of plausible pathways might be considered. When prioritising between pathways, it is important to consider both the significance of each pathway to the outcome of interest and to what extent it is (or might be) possible to intervene.

Identify the behaviours implicit in the pathway(s)

This means identifying who needs to act and what actions they must engage in to influence the outcome through the prioritised pathway(s). Often, several behaviours will contribute to each pathway, and one behaviour may be necessary or advantageous to encourage another. See figure 2 for an example.

Figure 2
Phase 1 of Framework.

Defining which actors must engage in which actions is critical to seeing a complex challenge through a behavioural lens. No matter how complex the issue or how structural or systemic it may seem, it can be distilled to one or more people who are making decisions and engaging in actions that together contribute to that reality. Defining these behaviours does not reduce the complexity of the problem but offers a way forward to systematically address that complexity.

Prioritise among behaviours

Often, it will not be practical to address all of the relevant behaviours. Prioritisation among behaviours should consider the potential for impact by influencing each behaviour as well as political will, resources, timeline and connections to other priority behaviours. This prioritisation does not indicate a judgement about which behaviours or actors are most important, but instead an assessment of where a careful investigation is likely to generate the greatest value for policy, programme or service changes.

### Applying health behavior theory to multiple behavior change: considerations and approaches [^115QQ87b]. Preventive Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Background

There has been a dearth of theorizing in the area of multiple behavior change. The purpose of the current article was to examine how health behavior theory might be applied to the growing research terrain of multiple behavior change.

Methods

Three approaches to applying health behavior theory to multiple behavior change are advanced, including searching the literature for potential examples of such applications.

Results

These three approaches to multiple behavior change include (1) a behavior change principles approach; (2) a global health / behavioral category approach, and (3) a multiple behavioral approach. Each approach is discussed and explicated and examples from this emerging literature are provided.

Conclusions

Further study in this area has the potential to broaden our understanding of multiple behaviors and multiple behavior change. Implications for additional theory-testing and application of theory to interventions are discussed.

### Exploring the relationship between anthropomorphism and theory-of-mind in brain and behaviour [^1144QUSC]. Human Brain Mapping (2021). Medium credibility.

Observing, inferring, and predicting internal states of non‐human agents and objects could be partly dependent on low‐level processes that are distinct from those active when encountering human agents. A two‐stage process of anthropomorphism would suggest that these early low‐level perceptual processes are complemented at a later stage by using language derived from theory‐of‐mind. Anthropomorphism could be the end result of an otherwise largely perceptual process. This two‐stage process explains why measures that probe the ability to understand and predict the behaviour of the characters in the film were related to situational anthropomorphism. Inferring and understanding the behaviour of agents is a mixture of complex interactive predictive processes, ranging from perceptual processes (e.g. action observation and prediction; Cross et al.) to theory‐of‐mind‐like processes. The extent to which interactions with non‐human agents trigger similar social cognitive mechanisms as do interactions with other humans is still up for debate. Thus, researchers have to entertain the possibility that interactions with non‐human agents might trigger processes that are not social in nature or do not match one‐to‐one with the processes that are active during interactions human counterparts (Cross & Ramsey; Henschel et al.).

In order to better understand the way humans attribute socialness and even form social relationships with non‐human agents and objects, a better understanding of the role anthropomorphism and theory‐of‐mind play in these new interactions is warranted. Here, we used a multi‐dimensional, multi‐method, representative‐sample approach, combining both exploratory and confirmatory analyses, to provide new evidence on the relationship between these important facets of everyday social cognition. Future research combining brain and behavioural measures of anthropomorphism and theory‐of‐mind across similarly diverse samples will help us to better understand how people develop social bonds with humans and non‐human agents alike, across situations and individuals.

### Self-utility distance as a computational approach to understanding self-concept clarity [^1145Rwum]. Communications Psychology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

By integrating insights from self-concept dynamics, personality research, and reinforcement learning, we introduced Self-Utility Distance as a predictor that might help illuminate the mechanisms underlying Self-Concept Clarity. In our first study, we found that the unresolved distance between individuals' current self-attributes and their estimated functional utilities is associated with diminished clarity in self-concept. In our second study, we found the stronger and independent predictive power of Self-Utility Distance over Self-Concept Clarity in comparison to the components of the Self-Discrepancy Theory. Finally, in our third study, we provide computational evidence of the underpinnings of the trait-utility learning underlying Self-Utility Distance. Our findings suggest that individuals employ strategies to learn and align socially shared perceptions of trait utility with their current self-concepts, thereby preventing the maximization of Self-Utility Distance in response to environmental feedback. By elucidating the mechanistic principles and predictive capacity of Self-Utility Distance, we provide a fresh perspective that could help clarify the dynamics of Self-Concept Clarity and understand its role as a major predictor of psychological functioning and well-being.

The association found between Self-Utility Distance and Self-Concept Clarity aligns with prior research suggesting that a perceived need for personal change might disrupt the integrity of the self-concept. Moreover, this finding may offer insights into why variables such as certainty and temporal stability, although central to its definition, do not accurately predict general measures of Self-Concept Clarity. For example, although an individual may be highly certain of their organized, structured, and methodical nature, the estimated functional utility of these traits may be diminished in a new and rapidly evolving work environment (i.e. high Self-Utility Distance). In such instances, holding a strong certainty regarding any personal attribute might not directly translate into subjective Self-Concept Clarity, as those attributes would be perceived as misaligned with the individual's current life circumstances. Additionally, while temporal stability suggests a consistent self-view over time, temporal variations might be the result of both inconsistent self-evaluation and necessary adaptative changes driven by evolving life circumstances. We anticipate that those changes that respond to reducing the distance between current self-attributes and their new functional utility in a novel life setting might protect from disruptions in Self-Concept Clarity. In line with this notion, recent research indicates that not all self-concept changes accompanying life transitions disrupt Self-Concept Clarity, as long as they are rewarding for the individual.

### Trauma-informed care [^1128wjbN]. Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

Resilience — definition and adaptational mechanisms (Table 4) — is defined as a dynamic process of positive adaptation to or despite significant adversities and is not a static or innate quality but includes skills children can learn over time with reliable support from attachment figures. Studies have shown that development can be robust, even in the face of severe adversity, if certain basic adaptational mechanisms of human development (resilience factors) are protected and in good working order; these mechanisms include attachment to a competent caregiver, cognitive development with opportunity for continued growth, mastery of age-salient developmental tasks, self-control or self-regulation, belief that life has meaning, hope for the future, a sense of self-efficacy, and a network of supportive relationships. Table 4 specifies these mechanisms as thinking and learning; hope; regulation; efficacy; attachment; development; and social context, with descriptors including cognitive development, optimism and belief in a future, self-regulation, self-efficacy, secure attachment with a safe, stable, and nurturing or competent caregiver, mastery of age-salient tasks, and the larger network of healthy relationships in which one lives and learns.

### Award for distinguished scientific early career contributions to psychology: katherine B. ehrlich [^116eBMbs]. The American Psychologist (2020). Medium credibility.

The Early Career Awards, given for the first time in 1974, recognize the large number of excellent early career psychologists. Recipients of this award may not have held a doctoral degree for more than nine years. For purposes of this award, psychology has been divided into 10 areas: animal learning and behavior, comparative; developmental; health; cognition/human learning; psychopathology; behavioral and cognitive neuroscience; perception/motor performance; social; applied research; and individual differences. Five areas are considered each year, with areas rotated in two-year cycles. The areas considered in 2020 were animal learning and behavior, comparative; developmental; health; cognition/ human learning; and psychopathology. Each year, panels are selected for the areas under consideration, and these panels recommend nominees to the Committee on Scientific Awards. The 2020 recipients of the APA Scientific Contribution Awards were recognized by the 2019 Board of Scientific Affairs and selected by the 2019 Committee on Scientific Awards. For outstanding research that elucidates how children's social relationships affect their physical health. Katherine B. Ehrlich's innovative research brings together insights from multiple subareas of psychology, including health, developmental, and social, to address questions of great importance for public health and human development. Her studies are characterized by sophisticated theory, rigorous methodology, and impressive creativity. Her theoretical and empirical work is already leaving a substantial mark on the field and paving the way for an integrative biosocial science of human development.

### A practical approach for applying best practices in behavioural interventions to injury prevention [^117AL2pT]. Injury Prevention (2010). Low credibility.

Developing and applying a programme theory to guide interventions: a six-step approach

The six-step approach systematically presented in this paper takes the reader from defining a clearly articulated vision with goals for a new behavioural intervention through to development and testing of the success of the intervention's components in addressing the goals. The first three steps develop the intervention's programme theory, capturing the relationships between intervention components and goals and the vision through defined paths of influence, while the remaining three steps utilise the programme theory for intervention development and evaluation.

The six steps are:
Set a key health outcome (a clear, measurable, long-term vision related to injury reduction).
Identify behavioural objectives linked to the key health outcome.
Identify target constructs and their influence on the behavioural objectives.
Design and develop intervention content to address constructs.
Evaluate effectiveness of interventions.
Refine interventions and behaviour change model, when needed.

### In search of a theoretical structure for understanding motivation in schizophrenia [^115Zhey9]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2010). Low credibility.

This themed issue considers different ways to conceptualize the motivational impairment that is a core negative symptom of schizophrenia. Motivational impairment has been linked to poor functional outcome, thus it is important to understand the nature and causes of motivational impairment in order to develop better treatment strategies to enhance motivation and engage patients in the process of recovery. Motivation refers to the processes whereby goal-directed activities are instigated and sustained and can be thought of as the product of a complex interaction of physiological processes and social contextual variables. In this issue, the physiological processes of motivation are the focus of Barch and Dowd, who highlight the role of prefrontal and subcortical mesolimbic dopamine systems in incentive-based learning and the difficulties people with schizophrenia have using internal representations of relevant experiences and goals to drive the behavior that should allow them to obtain desired outcomes. The articles in this issue by Choi et al. Nakagami et al., and Silverstein, focus on social contextual or environmental variables that can shape behavior and motivation. Together, these articles highlight the impact of external cues and goal properties on the expectations and values attached to goal outcomes. Expectancy-value and Self-Determination theories provide an overarching framework to accommodate the perspectives and data provided in all these articles. In the following introduction we show how the articles in this themed issue both support the role of expectancies and value in motivation in schizophrenia and elucidate possible deficiencies in the way expectations and value get assigned.

### A practical approach for applying best practices in behavioural interventions to injury prevention [^111f9ese]. Injury Prevention (2010). Low credibility.

Step 6: refine interventions and behaviour change model with knowledge gained from intervention evaluation

If interventions prove unsuccessful or produce unfavourable outcomes, the underlying behaviour change model, the programme theory, and/or the intervention content and its implementation may need to be modified. Findings from the intervention evaluation can be used to inform this process and the preceding steps should be repeated until positive results are achieved. If the evaluation proves the intervention successful, dissemination and distribution are the next steps. This step also requires strategies as distribution may require stakeholders to adopt and deliver the intervention. Steps 1–5 can be used to develop and evaluate a dissemination strategy while continuing to evaluate the original intervention in broader populations.

It is important to note that the six-step approach is not necessarily linear, but rather may require iteration and looping back to earlier steps based on negative findings or new information. All six steps in this process require periodic review to take into account new scientific knowledge and other changes that may occur, either on their own or as a result of the intervention (eg, if a relevant law is passed, normative behaviour may change and changing norms may no longer remain an important target construct). It is important to remember that thoughtful planning and pre-testing is necessary if the intervention is to be delivered to a population that differs in key characteristics from the original population (eg, in another country).

Depending on the target behaviour and constructs, multiple behavioural science frameworks can be applied to inform the behaviour change paths. Widely used models are presented within an injury context by Gielen et al, and include: the integrative model of behaviour change, a well-established theoretical framework that incorporates concepts from the theory of reasoned action; the theory of planned behaviour; and social cognitive theory.

Application of step 6

At the time of this writing, the process and outcome evaluations of the RLAF 2008 pilot are underway. Lessons learned from these evaluations will be used to inform revisions to the initiative components and their delivery before the initiative is disseminated broadly. If the initiative is found ineffective, further revision and piloting will be necessary. In addition, the evaluations will inform the underlying behavioural change model and programme theory on which the initiative was designed.

### A systematic review of associations between adverse peer experiences and emotion regulation in adolescence [^113iN4o4]. Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review (2021). Medium credibility.

Adolescence is a developmental period marked by changes in cognition, emotion, and social relations. For example, sensitivity to social feedback increases as peer relationships become more important yet less stable, leaving adolescents vulnerable to experiences of peer victimization and rejection. Given that prefrontal brain regions responsible for regulatory abilities continue to mature during adolescence, the brain is especially susceptible to environmental influences. As such, exposure to adverse peer experiences may undermine emotion regulation development. Thus, the present review sought to elucidate the association between adverse peer experiences and emotion regulation in adolescence (i.e. age 12–17 years). Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, a systematic review of the literature assessing adverse peer experiences (victimization and rejection) and emotion regulation (including neurobiological, behavioral, cognitive levels of analysis) was conducted (N articles included = 27). Results demonstrate that adverse peer experiences are negatively associated with emotion regulation processes, behaviorally and neurally. Although variability in definitions and measurement of constructs make nuanced comparisons between studies difficult, the present systematic review organizes this body of literature and discusses how promising theoretical perspectives, including the cognitive control of emotion model and social information processing theory, may help to explain this association. Finally, recommendations for future work to expand our understanding of these processes, and for intervention and prevention efforts (e.g., school-based violence prevention and socio-emotional learning programs, parenting practices) that may serve to ameliorate outcomes for youths facing adverse peer experiences and emotion dysregulation, are discussed.

### Peers and adolescent smoking [^115mRKo2]. Addiction (2003). Low credibility.

There is a considerable body of empirical research that has identified adolescent peer relationships as a primary factor involved in adolescent cigarette smoking. Despite this large research base, many questions remain unanswered about the mechanisms by which peers affect youths' smoking behavior. Understanding these processes of influence is key to the development of prevention and intervention programs designed to address adolescent smoking as a significant public health concern. In this paper, theoretical frameworks and empirical findings are reviewed critically which inform the current state of knowledge regarding peer influences on teenage smoking. Specifically, social learning theory, primary socialization theory, social identity theory and social network theory are discussed. Empirical findings regarding peer influence and selection, as well as multiple reference points in adolescent friendships, including best friendships, romantic relationships, peer groups and social crowds, are also reviewed. Review of this work reveals the contribution that peers have in adolescents' use of tobacco, in some cases promoting use, and in other cases deterring it. This review also suggests that peer influences on smoking are more subtle than commonly thought and need to be examined more carefully, including consideration of larger social contexts, e.g. the family, neighborhood, and media. Recommendations for future investigations are made, as well as suggestions for specific methodological approaches that offer promise for advancing our knowledge of the contribution of peers on adolescent tobacco use.

### Reducing the use of physical restraints in home care: development and feasibility testing of a multicomponent program to support the implementation of a guideline [^113xcMhs]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

A validated evidence-based guideline was developed to reduce physical restraint use in home care. However, the implementation of guidelines in home care is challenging. Therefore, this study aims to systematically develop and evaluate a multicomponent program for the implementation of the guideline for reducing the use of physical restraints in home care.

Methods

Intervention Mapping was used to develop a multicomponent program. This method contains six steps. Each step comprises several tasks towards the design, implementation and evaluation of an intervention; which is theory and evidence informed, as well as practical. To ensure that the multicomponent program would support the implementation of the guideline in home care, a feasibility study of 8 months was organized in one primary care district in Flanders, Belgium. A concurrent triangulation mixed methods design was used to evaluate the multicomponent program consisting of a knowledge test, focus groups and an online survey.

Results

The Social Cognitive Theory and the Theory of Planned Behavior are the foundations of the multicomponent program. Based on modeling, active learning, guided practice, belief selection and resistance to social pressure, eight practical applications were developed to operationalize these methods. The key components of the program are: the ambassadors for restraint-free home care (n = 15), the tutorials, the physical restraint checklist and the flyer. The results of the feasibility study show the necessity to select uniform terminology and definition for physical restraints, to involve all stakeholders from the beginning of the process, to take time for the implementation process, to select competent ambassadors and to collaborate with other home care providers.

Conclusions

The multicomponent program shows promising results. Prior to future use, further research needs to focus on the last two steps of Intervention Mapping (program implementation plan and developing an evaluation plan), to guide implementation on a larger scale and to formally evaluate the effectiveness of the multicomponent program.

### Promoting more integrative strategies for leadership theory-building [^115131Xb]. The American Psychologist (2007). Low credibility.

The agenda for theory and research in the field of leadership studies has evolved over the last 100 years from focuses on the internal dispositions associated with effective leaders to broader inquiries that include emphases on the cognitions, attributes, behaviors, and contexts in which leaders and followers are dynamically embedded and interact over time. Leadership theory and research has reached a point in its development at which it needs to move to the next level of integration — considering the dynamic interplay between leaders and followers, taking into account the prior, current, and emerging context — for continued progress to be made in advancing both the science and practice of leadership.

### Social neuroscience: understanding the pieces fosters understanding the whole and vice versa [^114eduqD]. The American Psychologist (2002). Low credibility.

Social science and neuroscience perspectives represent two ends of a continuum of levels of organization studied in psychology. Human behavior as a whole unfolds at social levels of organization, whereas much of the research in psychology has focused on cognitive and biological pieces of this whole. Recent evidence underscores the complementary nature of social, cognitive, and biological levels of analysis and how research integrating these levels can foster more comprehensive theories of the mechanisms underlying complex behavior and the mind. This research underscores the unity of psychology and the importance of retaining multilevel integrative research that spans molar and molecular levels of analysis.

### Neural similarity in nucleus accumbens during decision-making for the self and a best friend: links to adolescents' self-reported susceptibility to peer influence and risk taking [^114vGPgm]. Human Brain Mapping (2023). Medium credibility.

1.1 Theoretical perspectives on peer influence susceptibility and risk taking in adolescence

Several theoretical perspectives elucidate why and how adolescents may conform to their peers and engage in risky behaviors. According to Social Learning Theory, adolescents learn to adopt risk‐taking behaviors by observing and imitating the behaviors (i.e.g.aining peer status) of their socially valued peers (Telzer, van Hoorn, et al.). Such imitation is reinforced and internalized when teens gain affirmations of peer acceptance and other social rewards from high‐status peers (Kwon & Telzer). Social Identity Theory further suggests that conforming to perceived social norms within peer groups helps individuals achieve a favorable sense of self (Abrams & Hogg). It is thus intrinsically rewarding for adolescents to conform to peers' risk‐taking behaviors and to adjust their own behaviors to match perceived group norms. Critically, Social Identity Theory posits that once risk‐taking norms within peer groups are internalized, a shared sense of risk‐related norms determines how group members behave in future risk‐taking contexts. The result is behavioral homophily (i.e. similarity) over time via a depersonalization process, during which individuals often categorize themselves in relation to peers, mentalize how peers think and act in risk‐taking contexts, and subsequently change their risk‐related behaviors and attitudes to adhere to the norms endorsed by the peer group. Together, Social Learning and Social Identity theories suggest that adolescents who are more likely to imitate their peers, and whose self‐concept is more strongly aligned with that of their peers in risk‐taking contexts, may be more likely to adopt their peers' risk norms and change their own behaviors to match the risk‐taking social norms of their peers (for review, Kwon & Telzer). A recent theoretical framework — Representation and Incorporation of Close Others' Responses (RICOR) suggests that a wide range of others' social behaviors and attitudes are spontaneously represented by individuals, which results in self‐other overlap (i.e. similarity) that fundamentally primes one's behavioral conformity to others (Smith & Mackie). Notably, this RICOR theory suggests that this behavioral assimilation process is more likely to occur with those close to the perceivers, such as close friends. Indeed, recent developmental work shows that perceived norms from adolescents' best friends, but not from popular peers, are more significantly associated with adolescents' behaviors (Giletta et al.), including risky behaviors such as substance use (Field & Prinstein).

### Testing the reinforcement learning hypothesis of social conformity [^117JekJD]. Human Brain Mapping (2021). Medium credibility.

Although the present study used an experimental paradigm similar to that of the social conformity study that originally proposed the reinforcement learning hypothesis of social conformity (Klucharev et al. 2009), it should be noted that social conformity is not a unitary phenomenon and that some forms of social conformity may be more similar to reinforcement learning. At least three types of motivation for attitude change based on social influence have been identified in psychological studies (Cialdini & Goldstein, 2004; Petty & Cacioppo, 1981), and they include the following: (a) motivation to be accurate, (b) motivation to obtain social approval from others, and (c) motivation to maintain a positive self‐concept (which includes attitude change following cognitive dissonance). The majority of previous neuroimaging studies on social conformity used the face rating task (or a similar task which involves subjective ratings of stimuli) (Izuma, 2013). The conformity effect reported in these studies can be explained by the motivation to obtain social approval and/or the motivation to maintain a positive self‐concept, but it cannot be explained by the motivation to be accurate as there is no right or wrong answer in facial attractiveness rating. In a situation where individuals strongly believe that group opinion is more accurate than their own opinion (e.g. group opinion ≈ correct performance feedback), social conflict can serve as a teaching signal just like prediction error in the reinforcement learning task. In fact, the pMFC, insula, and striatum are related to prediction error in a semantic learning paradigm where no reward is involved (i.e. acquiring new semantic knowledge based on performance feedback [correct or incorrect]) (Pine, Sadeh, Ben‐Yakov, Dudai, & Mendelsohn, 2018). In this study, prediction error in each trial was calculated based on a subjective rating of confidence and on feedback received by participants (e.g. a positive prediction error signal is generated when individuals were not confident about their answer but received a correct feedback). Further, activities in the pMFC and insula were found to be positively related to unsigned prediction error, whereas striatum activities were found to be positively related to signed prediction error (Pine et al. 2018). Thus, how these brain regions process social conflict might be more similar to reinforcement learning in a different social conformity paradigm where a right answer can be objectively defined (i.e. where social conflict can serve as a strong teaching signal), and this is an important avenue for future research.

### The science of learning: breaking news [^11444qSy]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2011). Low credibility.

We begin with a paradox. On one hand, not nearly enough is known about exactly how learning takes place in the brain, although exciting new results are emerging thanks to improved brain imaging and a greater focus on neuroscience by government and universities. But this research is just beginning, and a much larger effort and investment are needed to answer even the most basic questions. On the other hand, more than enough is already known about what best promotes learning to motivate and drive educational reform for years to come. This is a report from the front lines of both research and educational implementation. This information should prove of use to anyone — teachers, students, parents, patients, and health practitioners — who is concerned about how best to improve formal or informal teaching and learning, to help people remember complex instructions, or to change unhealthy habits and practices.

### Dynamic influences on the neural encoding of social valence [^114qw6RR]. Nature Reviews: Neuroscience (2022). High credibility.

Social valence

Determining whether something is good or bad is one of the most important functions that the brain performs. Models of emotion posit that emotional states can be explained by how aversive or rewarding a stimulus is (valence) and how much arousal it evokes. Here, we apply this general definition of valence to social stimuli. Similar to other stimuli, social stimuli are attributed as having a negative (unpleasant) or positive (pleasant) valence. This valence assignment is accompanied by observable changes in behaviour — approach towards a social stimulus of positive valence and avoidance of a negative-valence social stimulus. Many psychiatric disorders are characterized by dysregulated emotional processing and social behaviours, which could be driven by disruptions of valence encoding –. Furthermore, across psychiatric disorders, brain regions that encode both valence and social functions show aberrant activation during emotional processing.

Appropriate valence assignment to social stimuli is necessary to seek and maintain healthy social lives and is vital for the survival of a social species. Unlike many other stimuli, social relationships are bidirectionally dynamic, involving flexible changes in behaviour of two active agents, both of which can affect the other. This makes the assignment of valence to social stimuli more complex than for other stimuli. Flexibility in social valence assignment is necessary to allow for changes in social motivation as a social relationship or the environment changes — seeking interactions when they are beneficial and avoiding them when they are not.

The perceived valence of a social agent relies primarily on their social alignment: whether the relationship between oneself and the agent is competitive or cooperative (FIG. 1). The degree of opposition or alignment of two individuals' goals is a primary parameter that defines the social relationship and can dictate social valence assignment during a given interaction. In addition, internal states, experience-based predictions and responses to a changing environment all influence the valence assigned to a social stimulus, implemented across multiple circuit motifs. Computing social valence becomes highly complex, because it may incorporate the dynamic back and forth between two social agents. In addition, separate computations — each influenced by the relative rank, identity and history of previous interactions, — may be made for each individual in a social interaction. Predictions of valence in terms of how others will behave and affect the self may be extrapolated based on individualized models for theof each individual.
