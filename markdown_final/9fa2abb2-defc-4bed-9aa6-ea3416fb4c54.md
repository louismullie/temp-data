## Question

How do Holter monitor results influence medication adjustments?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how Holter monitor results influence medication adjustments across different scenarios and what the evidence shows about when and how these results change therapy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical contexts where Holter meaningfully alters management. Then, I should verify the specific medication changes triggered by Holter findings. Next, I will examine the strength of evidence and guideline support for these practices. After that, I need to check limitations and when Holter does not change management. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified approach and conclude with a concise clinical takeaway.

> Let me first confirm the clinical contexts where Holter results most often lead to medication changes. I should confirm that these include atrial fibrillation or flutter with rate or rhythm control, ventricular arrhythmias including PVCs and NSVT, bradyarrhythmias affecting rate-slowing drugs, and drug-induced QT prolongation or proarrhythmia, with additional roles in heart failure, neurology populations such as stroke/TIA, and post-ablation surveillance, as supported by consensus and guideline statements and observational cohorts [^113Ei1CV] [^114a8ivw] [^115WmoWe] [^116hf9j3] [^112cdFH4].

> Now, I will examine specific medication adjustments triggered by Holter. Wait, let me verify the concrete examples: in AF, Holter can prompt initiation or intensification of beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, or antiarrhythmics, and guide anticoagulation decisions when AF burden is documented, consistent with AF guidelines and stroke monitoring trials [^116EnEdC] [^113vVmWg] [^116hf9j3]. In ventricular arrhythmias, frequent PVCs or NSVT may lead to beta-blocker therapy, consideration of antiarrhythmics such as amiodarone or sotalol, or even discontinuation of offending agents if proarrhythmia is suspected, with ESC guidance supporting Holter in incidental NSVT and consensus on therapy response assessment [^111begqT] [^115WmoWe]. For bradyarrhythmias, significant pauses or conduction disease may necessitate withholding or down-titration of beta-blockers or other rate-slowing drugs, and occasionally precipitate pacemaker referral, as observed in stroke cohorts and bradycardia guidance [^116hf9j3] [^115WmoWe]. For QT-prolonging drugs, Holter can reveal excessive QT prolongation or torsades, prompting dose reduction or discontinuation and inpatient telemetry during initiation, per pharmacology consensus and labeling for agents like quinidine [^115WmoWe] [^114K5uUF] [^11792Pi3].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about universal benefit; I need to check the strength of evidence. Randomized and prospective data show that systematic in-hospital Holter in acute stroke uncovered abnormal ECGs in about 19% and led to beta-blocker changes in about 19% of those with abnormalities, with lower 24‑month mortality in the monitored group, suggesting clinically meaningful downstream effects even if anticoagulation rates were not significantly different at 12 months [^116hf9j3] [^116qxovU]. In AF ablation follow-up, expert consensus recommends scheduled Holter monitoring to detect asymptomatic recurrences that can alter antiarrhythmic or anticoagulation strategies, reinforcing Holter's role in post-procedural management [^112cdFH4] [^115QVXK8]. For ventricular arrhythmias, guidelines endorse ambulatory ECG to diagnose and assess treatment response, and ESC specifically recommends ≥ 24‑hour Holter in incidental NSVT, aligning with practice to adjust therapy based on burden and symptoms [^114a8ivw] [^111begqT].

> But wait, what if Holter does not change management; I should double-check the limitations. In unselected stroke cohorts, routine Holter rarely alters therapy, with one study showing no management changes from Holter, underscoring the importance of pretest probability and targeted use rather than blanket screening [^117C2n69]. In pediatrics, routine Holter screening in otherwise healthy children on propranolol for hemangiomas did not change management, arguing against routine Holter in low-risk populations [^117LnKRZ]. In Parkinson's disease, a randomized trial found no superiority of a Parkinson's Holter (STAT-ON) over diaries or usual care for motor outcomes, reminding me that device choice must match the clinical question and that rhythm Holter principles do not generalize to movement disorder monitoring [^111gpwM5]. Moreover, real-time ambulatory ECG did not consistently expedite interventions compared with traditional Holter in broad cohorts, highlighting workflow and system delays that blunt apparent advantages [^113bLqxs].

> Next, I should review how Holter results are operationalized into medication changes. Let me think about practical thresholds: for AF rate control, average ventricular rates above guideline targets on Holter can prompt up-titration of beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers, while documented AF burden can trigger anticoagulation per stroke risk, consistent with AF guidelines and stroke monitoring trials [^116EnEdC] [^113vVmWg]. For ventricular ectopy, frequent PVCs, multifocal morphology, or NSVT may prompt beta-blocker therapy, consideration of antiarrhythmics in selected patients, or evaluation for reversible causes, with the caveat that suppression targets derived from 24‑hour recordings have reproducibility limits and should be interpreted in clinical context [^115WmoWe] [^113bp1wx]. For QT monitoring, a QTc increase to more than 500 ms or more than 130% of baseline on Holter during drug therapy should prompt dose reduction or discontinuation and consideration of inpatient telemetry, per pharmacology guidance and labeling for QT-prolonging agents [^115WmoWe] [^114K5uUF] [^11792Pi3].

> I need to ensure I address special populations where Holter yield is higher. In Duchenne muscular dystrophy, significant Holter findings concentrate in patients with LV dysfunction, and medication changes occur almost exclusively in those with LVEF less than 35%, supporting risk-stratified Holter use rather than routine screening in all patients [^112bDRWh]. In congenital heart disease, surveillance Holter has a low rate of management change and high cost per actionable result, again arguing for selective, risk-based deployment rather than blanket screening [^112ZRt97]. In cardiac sarcoidosis, underuse of 24‑hour Holter has been highlighted, suggesting that targeted monitoring in inflammatory cardiomyopathies may be underutilized relative to its potential to alter management [^115MrBPV].

> Let me reconsider the role of duration and modality, because diagnostic yield affects the likelihood of actionable Holter results. Compared with 24‑hour Holter, 14‑day patch monitors detect more AF and NSVT, but longer monitoring does not always translate into improved outcomes or resource utilization, so I should match duration to symptom frequency and clinical stakes rather than default to prolonged monitoring for all [^114eKPWq]. For sporadic symptoms, event monitors or extended patch systems may be preferable to short Holter, whereas daily symptoms or post-procedural surveillance are well suited to 24–48‑hour Holter, aligning with consensus device selection guidance [^1115F1SB].

> I should confirm that guidelines explicitly tie Holter to medication decisions where appropriate. AF guidelines endorse ambulatory ECG to evaluate rate control adequacy and to judge rhythm management, and they recommend exercise testing when rate control across activity is in question, reinforcing Holter's role in titrating rate-slowing drugs and antiarrhythmics [^116EnEdC] [^113wPGX4]. Ventricular arrhythmia guidelines support ambulatory ECG to correlate symptoms, quantify burden, and assess therapy response, which directly informs whether to start, stop, or adjust antiarrhythmic therapy [^114a8ivw]. Pharmacology consensus recommends periodic clinical assessment with attention to rhythm and conduction intervals, and in selected drugs, serum level monitoring alongside ECG surveillance to balance efficacy and proarrhythmic risk, which Holter can complement by capturing asymptomatic events [^1118sQyX] [^1113c52K].

> Hold on, I should verify system-level considerations that modulate whether Holter findings actually change therapy. Real-time monitoring did not consistently shorten time to intervention in routine care, likely due to delays in clinician review, patient contact, and scheduling, so a structured pathway for reviewing Holter results and acting on actionable findings is essential to realize benefits [^113bLqxs]. Similarly, in stroke programs, embedding Holter within a protocol that triggers cardiology consultation and medication review appears to mediate improved outcomes, suggesting that the care process around the test is as important as the test itself [^116hf9j3] [^1149NehY].

> Let me synthesize a practical, risk-stratified approach. For high-yield scenarios such as documented or suspected AF needing rate or rhythm control, ventricular arrhythmias with symptoms or structural heart disease, bradyarrhythmias in patients on rate-slowing drugs, and initiation or up-titration of QT-prolonging agents, Holter can directly inform medication adjustments and should be prioritized with predefined action thresholds and follow-up plans [^116EnEdC] [^114a8ivw] [^115WmoWe]. For low-yield settings such as unselected stroke without AF suspicion, routine pediatric screening, or low-risk patients without symptoms, Holter rarely changes management and should be avoided or reserved for specific indications, consistent with stroke and pediatric data and general principles of selective testing [^117C2n69] [^117LnKRZ]. I should double-check that this aligns with guideline emphasis on matching monitoring modality and duration to symptom pattern and clinical question, which it does [^1115F1SB].

> In conclusion, Holter results influence medication adjustments when they uncover actionable arrhythmias or conduction abnormalities that alter risk–benefit for ongoing drug therapy, with the strongest evidence for AF rate or rhythm control, ventricular arrhythmia burden assessment, bradyarrhythmia management affecting rate-slowing drugs, and QT surveillance during proarrhythmic therapies, while benefits are maximized when results are embedded in structured care pathways and applied to appropriately selected patients [^116EnEdC] [^114a8ivw] [^115WmoWe] [^116hf9j3].

Holter monitoring guides medication adjustments by revealing **arrhythmias and rate-control issues** that are not captured on a standard ECG [^113Ei1CV]. Key findings that prompt changes include **atrial fibrillation/flutter** (initiate or adjust anticoagulation, rate/rhythm control) [^113vVmWg] [^116EnEdC], **bradyarrhythmias** (reduce or stop beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, or antiarrhythmics; consider pacing) [^1115F1SB], and **ventricular arrhythmias** (titrate beta-blockers, add antiarrhythmics, or refer for ablation/device therapy) [^114a8ivw] [^111begqT]. Holter also detects **drug-induced QT prolongation** or proarrhythmia, prompting dose reduction or discontinuation of offending agents [^115WmoWe] [^114K5uUF]. These adjustments are aligned with guideline-directed therapy and are most impactful when Holter findings are integrated with symptoms and clinical context [^11722eFh] [^113Ei1CV].

---

## Clinical scenarios prompting medication adjustments

### Atrial fibrillation/flutter (AF/AFL)

- **Detection of AF/AFL**: Holter monitoring can detect asymptomatic or paroxysmal AF/AFL, guiding initiation or adjustment of anticoagulation therapy to prevent stroke [^113vVmWg] [^1114hm3X].

- **Rate control**: Holter helps assess the adequacy of rate control, guiding titration of beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, or digoxin [^116EnEdC].

- **Rhythm control**: Holter monitoring evaluates the efficacy of antiarrhythmic drugs or ablation therapy, prompting adjustments in medication or procedural interventions [^112cdFH4].

---

### Bradyarrhythmias

- **Bradycardia detection**: Holter identifies significant bradyarrhythmias, including sinus node dysfunction and atrioventricular block, necessitating dose reduction or discontinuation of beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, or antiarrhythmic drugs [^115WmoWe].

- **Pacemaker implantation**: Persistent bradyarrhythmias may prompt consideration of pacemaker implantation, leading to cessation of negatively chronotropic medications [^115WmoWe].

---

### Ventricular arrhythmias

Detection of ventricular ectopy, nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT), or sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) may prompt initiation or titration of beta-blockers or antiarrhythmic drugs (e.g. amiodarone, sotalol) [^115WmoWe]. Significant ventricular arrhythmias may necessitate referral for catheter ablation or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement, with subsequent medication adjustments [^112R7xhu].

---

### Drug-induced arrhythmias and QT prolongation

Holter monitoring can reveal **QT prolongation** or torsades de pointes associated with medications, prompting dose reduction or discontinuation of offending agents [^115WmoWe]. Detection of proarrhythmic effects may necessitate alternative antiarrhythmic therapy or additional monitoring strategies [^1118sQyX].

## Specific medication adjustments based on Holter findings

| **Clinical finding** | **Medication adjustment** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Atrial fibrillation/flutter | Initiate or adjust anticoagulation (warfarin, DOACs) | Stroke prevention [^113vVmWg] |
| Rapid atrial fibrillation | Increase dose of beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers | Rate control [^116EnEdC] |
| Bradyarrhythmias | Reduce or discontinue beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, antiarrhythmics | Prevent worsening bradycardia [^notfound] |
| Ventricular arrhythmias | Initiate or titrate beta-blockers, antiarrhythmics (amiodarone, sotalol) | Suppress arrhythmias [^115WmoWe] |
| QT prolongation | Discontinue or reduce dose of offending medication | Prevent torsades de pointes [^115WmoWe] |
| Drug-induced arrhythmias | Alternative antiarrhythmic therapy | Avoid proarrhythmic effects [^1118sQyX] |

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

- **AF guidelines**: Recommend Holter monitoring to assess rate control adequacy and guide medication adjustments [^116EnEdC].

- **VA guidelines**: Emphasize ambulatory ECG monitoring to evaluate symptoms, diagnose arrhythmias, and assess treatment response [^114a8ivw].

- **Bradycardia guidelines**: Recommend Holter monitoring for symptomatic bradyarrhythmias, guiding medication adjustments and pacing decisions [^1115F1SB].

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **Patient-specific factors**: Age, comorbidities, and concurrent medications influence medication adjustments based on Holter findings [^114K5uUF].

- **Clinical context**: Holter findings must be integrated with patient symptoms, clinical judgment, and other diagnostic tests [^114a8ivw].

- **Reproducibility**: Day-to-day variability in arrhythmia burden may necessitate repeated Holter monitoring for accurate assessment [^115WmoWe].

---

Holter monitoring provides **critical data** that guide medication adjustments across arrhythmias and drug-induced effects, enabling tailored therapy and improved outcomes when integrated with clinical context [^111KBCN4].

### Cardiological diagnostic work-up in stroke patients – a comprehensive study of test results and therapeutic implications [^117C2n69]. European Journal of Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

In some Western countries, many stroke patients undergo routine tests including ECG, echocardiography, carotid ultrasound and Holter monitoring, even though they have been shown to express limited value in unselected patients. Comprehensive data on yield of tests, especially on consequences taken from positive test results, are scanty.

Methods

Consecutive stroke patients with evidence of ischaemic lesions by imaging techniques were included. Aetiology was determined using TOAST-classifications. Rates of positive test results and their impact on drug therapy, especially anticoagulation were evaluated.

Results

Two hundred and forty-one consecutive patients, age 69 ± 13 years were included. Positive test results were documented in 19% with 12-lead ECG, 24% with carotid ultrasound, 24% with echocardiography and never with Holter monitoring. Overall, in 41% positive test results were present. Apart from echocardiography (37%), a change of therapy resulted in 51–56% of patients with a positive test result.

Conclusions

Even though 12-lead ECG, carotid ultrasound and echocardiography only had relatively low incidences of positive findings, their impact on management in case of positive test results was quite high. Nevertheless, future studies to select patients more appropriately are needed. In contrast, Holter monitoring had no impact and should not be used in routine evaluation of stroke patients.

Cox-Maze outcomes and complications — In ablation-assisted Cox-Maze experiences, in the entire patient cohort, 89% of patients were in sinus rhythm with or without antiarrhythmic drug therapy, and 78% were in sinus rhythm and free of antiarrhythmic drug therapy at 12-month follow-up. Monitoring included Holter monitors every three months in 70% of patients, with major complications in 11% including an operative mortality of 2% and a 1.7% incidence of stroke, and pacemakers implanted in 9% post operatively.

### State of the art of mobile health technologies use in clinical arrhythmia care [^115gxc93]. Communications Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Some trials have validated the ability of PPG and ECG-based wearables to detect AF in patients with a prior history of AF, use of anti-arrhythmic drugs, prior cardioversion, and ablation. The "pill in the pocket" strategy, which involves carrying medication and using it only when needed, is well-suited for integration with mobile technologies. The potential advantages include a confirmatory validation of symptoms prior to therapy, earlier administration of antiarrhythmic drugs, closer monitoring, and confirmation of therapy success potentially avoiding emergency medical visits and side effects.

Additionally, QT monitoring is feasible with these devices, especially in patients receiving sotalol or dofetilide for rhythm control, as well as monitoring for recurrence after AF ablation. A reliable indicator of recurrence is of the utmost importance as it has been well described that the perception of AF symptoms changes after ablation and recurrence is an AF ablation quality indicator. Obtaining real-time reliable information will help clinicians make informed recommendations when treating patients.

The Heart Rhythm Society and European Heart Rhythm Association publications have offered practical advice concerning the use of wearables by patients for managing cardiovascular health and arrhythmias in various clinical situations. These papers outline tangible pathways for AF screening and management using digital technologies to enhance patient care –. Future research efforts will incorporate health apps and AI into treatment protocols as it has already been shown that the use of convolutional neural networks in the detection of AF is feasible.

Role of mHealth technologies in other arrhythmias

SVT

The paroxysmal nature of SVT and its unpredictability makes it a challenging arrhythmia to diagnose, as the arrhythmia often self-terminates before arrival at a healthcare facility for standard ECG recording. The diagnostic yield for traditional monitoring varies from as low as 10% for 24-h Holter monitors to 50–60% for medical-grade event monitors, illustrating that increased duration of monitoring improves yield. mHealth devices (ECG or PPG-based), facilitate relatively inexpensive, long-term rhythm monitoring and may successfully diagnose patients with brief episodes of sustained palpitations. The resolution of smartphone-based single-lead ECGs is sufficient to differentiate SVT from a common misdiagnosis of sinus tachycardia for experienced ECG readers (89% sensitivity and 91% specificity) and to determine mechanism. Despite this promise, only 51% of surveyed physicians indicated that they would proceed with an invasive EP study on the basis of a patient-recorded symptomatic, regular tachycardia via a handheld single-lead ECG system, illustrating the need for definitive prospective randomized trials.

Heart Rhythm (2014). Medium credibility.

Ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring and event recording in adults with congenital heart disease (CHD) show that Holter monitors are well studied, with a single-center review finding arrhythmias in 31% of Holters and 80% of detected arrhythmias asymptomatic; despite the high prevalence, detection may not modify therapy, as another series found only 4% of surveillance Holters changed management at a cost per clinically significant study of $12,732, with better yield in older patients and those after Mustard/Senning or Fontan; Holter monitoring can also assess autonomic nervous system function, with correlations of heart rate variability and turbulence to cardiac parameters and, in a prospective study of 43 patients, identification as potential risk predictors for sudden cardiac death, yet current evidence is too preliminary to support broad-scale autonomic nervous system surveillance testing recommendations in adults with CHD.

Gender and age — While the efficacy of AAD therapy appears to be similar in men and women, risk of proarrhythmias appears to be greater in women compared with men. Female sex has been associated with an increased risk of torsade de pointes (TdP) in those treated with Class I and III AADs. To minimize the risk of TdP in women, it is advisable to use the lowest effective doses, and to avoid the concomitant use of any QT prolonging agent. Given the increased risk of proarrhythmia with Class III AADs in women, these drugs should be avoided if they present additional risk factors for torsades, including the presence of heart failure. When there is suspicion for proarrhythmia, 24 h of Holter monitoring can be helpful due to the reverse-use dependence of Class III drugs and propensity for proarrhythmia during periods of nocturnal bradycardia. Finally, patients should be instructed to contact providers when they suffer from dizziness or palpitations. Arrhythmias are much more frequent with advanced age and age-related physiologic changes significantly alter AAD Rx.

2. Identify Clinical Care Pathways

Screening

Assess value according to the population addressed.
Establish a uniform set of criteria for clinical actionability (Slotwiner 2019).

Screening should be medically directed and not driven by commercial interests. Caution should be exercised in extrapolating management strategies learned from cohorts with clinically diagnosed AF (usually from health care system data, trials, or inpatient registries) to AF detected with mHealth technologies (healthy consumers). Data from low-risk populations carry a relatively high risk of false positives, which may generate additional tests with resultant clinical risk to patient (even inducing anxiety rather than reassurance), risk from overtreatment, and costs to the payor. There is a risk that unless directed to a higher risk population, screening for AF using mHealth technologies may fail and follow the trajectory of many medical screening programs throughout history.

Key Knowledge Gap

Identify characteristics (duration, episode number/density) and risk factors that justify anticoagulation for mHealth-detected AF.

Disease Management

Identify conditions and schedules for home-based therapeutic strategies that may reduce dependency on clinic evaluations (as shown for CIEDs).
Identify signals that predict decompensation and design preemptive interventions.
Assess efficacy of therapies.

Outcomes

### Holter in monitoring of cardiac pacing [^115X4jJb]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

The Holter function of implanted devices will record events with characteristics meeting criteria determined by the manufacturer or programmed by the physician. It does not show a continuous ECG. It is reliable, provided the basic functions of the device are operating correctly. This is an ideal tool for assessing the electrophysiologic profile of heart disease patients with implants and to assess the efficacy of various treatments (anti-arrhythmic drugs, ablation procedures). Combined with telemedicine technology, it can provide early alerts to the physician about deterioration in the rhythmic or hemodynamic status of their patients and thus prevent complications that would otherwise have led to costly hospitalizations. It is a very reliable tool to assess ICD function (diagnostic capabilities by the discrimination algorithms and efficacy of the delivered therapies). The technology will evolve and offer extended data in the future, such as sensor information or repolarization data (ST segment, QT duration, variability, &c.).

### 2017 ISHNE-HRS expert consensus statement on ambulatory ECG and external cardiac monitoring / telemetry [^113Ei1CV]. Heart Rhythm (2017). Medium credibility.

2017 ISHNE-HRS expert consensus on ambulatory ECG and external cardiac monitoring/telemetry — abstract overview states that ambulatory ECG (AECG) is very commonly employed in a variety of clinical contexts to detect cardiac arrhythmias and/or arrhythmia patterns which are not readily obtained from the standard ECG. Accurate and timely characterization of arrhythmias is crucial to direct therapies that can have an important impact on diagnosis, prognosis or patient symptom status. The rhythm information derived from the large variety of AECG recording systems can often lead to appropriate and patient-specific medical and interventional management. The document provides background and framework from which to apply AECG techniques in clinical practice, as well as clinical research. Keywords highlight ambulatory ECG monitoring, event monitor, Holter, loop recorder, and telemetry.

### Prognostically optimal heart rate at discharge in hospitalized patients with heart Failure and atrial fibrillation [^116Ro9YV]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

The Central Illustration in our study demonstrated a linear correlation between HR and the primary endpoint. Analysis of the frequency of the primary endpoint within each HR subgroup yielded the following results: 43.8% in those with HR of 61 to 70 beats/min, 35.6% in patients with HR of 71 to 80 beats/min, and 46.2% in patients with HR exceeding 81 beats/min. It is important to consider that the potential influence of a smaller sample size may have contributed to these observations. Nevertheless, the study's findings are significant, as they established HR of 60 beats/min as a reference value and conducted a comparative analysis between patients with HR > 81 beats/min and those with lower HR. These results underscore the importance of controlling HR to a level below 80 beats/min at discharge in this patient population. The study also examined the role of beta-blockers, a common intervention for HR reduction. In the cohort with HR > 81 beats/min, 80% were on beta-blocker therapy. Despite this, patients with an HR > 81 beats/min exhibited an unfavorable prognosis, raising questions about the reasons behind this observation. One possible explanation could be the difficulties in achieving optimal uptitration of beta-blockers during hospitalization. Furthermore, it is plausible that some patients might have increased their beta-blocker dosage postdischarge. However, considering the study's focus on HR and medication dynamics during the hospitalization period, monitoring medication regimens following discharge presents a significant challenge. This limitation highlights the complexity of managing HR in patients with HF and AF, especially in the context of medication adjustments and their long-term implications. The study's findings emphasize the necessity of a comprehensive approach to HR management, including careful consideration of medication titration both during and after hospitalization. Despite guidelines recommending different medical therapies for HFrEF and HFpEF, our study demonstrated that the optimal target HR at discharge was not different between these groups. A previous study showed that HR > 81 beats/min was associated with a significantly higher risk of death from any cause in patients with HFrEF but did not focus on HFpEF. The prescription of beta-blockers was recommended for improving prognosis in patients with HFrEF and for HR control in patients with AF. We also analyzed beta-blocker users and found that maintaining HR below 80 beats/min significantly enhanced outcomes. Therefore, alongside traditional medical treatments, HR management is crucial in treating HF. The study cohort comprised elderly individuals, a crucial demographic to consider in medical research. During the initial 30-day follow-up, 10 patients succumbed to various causes. Notably, cardiovascular events accounted for the majority of deaths (5 cases), followed by sepsis (1 case), cancer (2 cases), and two cases of unknown etiology. This predominance of cardiovascular mortality underscores its significance in this population. Importantly, adverse events specifically linked to advanced age did not exhibit a significant association in this investigation. The beneficial effects of HR control in HF and AF may involve the reduction of sympathetic tone activation, which plays an important role in the progression of acute HF.HR control suggests a reduction in sympathetic tone, leading to a favorable prognosis and highlighting the benefits of HR reduction. Braunwald reported that HR reduction decreases myocardial oxygen demand and increases diastolic perfusion time. This extension in diastolic perfusion time increases coronary flow. Although an increased HR at admission may be a physiological compensatory mechanism, tachycardia itself can cause HF in AF. As a result, HR control in patients with HF and AF may be effective for prognosis after discharge.

### Prognostic significance of ambulatory ECG monitoring for ventricular arrhythmias [^117SfsBK]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Ventricular arrhythmia can be detected in ambulatory ECG monitoring in individuals with or without cardiac disease, and its prognostic value varies, depending on the underlying condition. The use of continuous or intermittent ambulatory ECG monitoring can be helpful for diagnosis when there is a high pre-test probability of identifying a transient arrhythmia. In addition, Holter monitoring can be used for risk stratification of patients, in the context of the prognostic value of non-sustained ventricular arrhythmias in various clinical settings, as discussed in detail.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained arrhythmia encountered in clinical practice. 1, 2 AF that remains untreated is associated with an increased risk of stroke, 3, 4, 5, 6 myocardial infarction, 7, 8 heart failure exacerbations, 4, 9 and all‐cause mortality. 4, 10, 11 The prevalence of AF will surge in the next decade due to an aging population that is living longer with a high burden of comorbid conditions that are associated with AF. 12, 13 Catheter radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is one form of therapy widely used in clinical practice to treat symptomatic AF, 2 but postprocedure recurrent AF occurs in 20% to 45% of patients. 14, 15 Direct current cardioversion (DCCV) interrupts AF and restores sinus rhythm, but has no durable effect. Even when patients receive additional antiarrhythmic drug therapy to maintain sinus rhythm, about 40% to 60% of the patients have AF recurrence within 3 months and 60% to 80% within 1 year after DCCV. 16, 17 AF management and symptom identification is challenging for both patients and providers because symptoms that are commonly associated with AF such as fatigue, shortness of breath, and palpitations may also be associated with coexisting cardiovascular conditions such as heart failure. Many AF patients fail to recognize and distinguish symptoms associated with AF, which may hinder timely treatment and put the patient at risk for complications. 18 Additionally, AF can be missed through conventional monitoring approaches, such as 12‐lead ECGs (electrocardiograms) and Holter studies, which only capture a finite period of time. 19, 20

Currently available mobile health tools that aim to promote earlier detection and treatment of AF and atrial flutter (AFL), adherence to cardiovascular regimens, and improvement in self‐management behaviors have not been systematically evaluated. The aim of this randomized, prospective study, iPhone Helping Evaluate Atrial fibrillation Rhythm through Technology (iHEART), was to evaluate the impact of frequent cardiac rhythm monitoring by self‐recordings on outcomes in post‐RFA and ‐DCCV populations with at least one known risk factor for AF. We hypothesized that providing patients with a rhythm monitoring device immediately after RFA or DCCV would result in a shorter time from RFA or DDCV to discovery and treatment of AF or AFL recurrence.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Ambulatory electrocardiography — Ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring is useful to evaluate whether symptoms, including palpitations, presyncope, or syncope, are caused by ventricular arrhythmias (VA) (Class I, Level of Evidence B-NR). Continuous or intermittent Holter or event recording is helpful in diagnosing suspected arrhythmias and assessing the response to therapy; a 24-hour continuous Holter recording is appropriate when symptoms occur at least once a day or when quantitation of PVCs/NSVT is desired. Adhesive patch monitors can record for weeks and allow continuous short-term 1-lead monitoring, and serial evaluations with exercise testing and/or 24-hour ambulatory monitoring are also used to assess rhythm burden. When suspicion of VA is high, outpatient ambulatory monitoring is inappropriate as prompt diagnosis and prevention of VA are warranted, and symptoms should be accurately correlated with arrhythmias detected by ambulatory ECG monitoring.

### Ambulatory monitoring and arrhythmic outcomes in pediatric and adolescent patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy [^112bDRWh]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) develop cardiac fibrosis and dilated cardiomyopathy. We described the frequency of significant Holter findings in DMD, the relationship between cardiac function and arrhythmia burden, and the impact of these findings on clinical management.

Methods and Results

A retrospective review was done of patients with DMD who received a Holter from 2010 to 2014. Clinical and arrhythmic outcomes were analyzed. Patients were classified based on left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF): ≥ 55%, 35% to 54% and < 35%. Significant Holter findings included atrial tachycardia, ventricular tachycardia and atrial fibrillation/flutter. Logistic regression was used to assess predictors of significant Holter findings and change in care. The study included 442 Holters in 235 patients. Mean age was 14 ± 4 years. Patients with cardiac dysfunction were older, and had increased late gadolinium enhancement and left ventricular dilation (P < 0.01). There were 3 deaths (1%), all with normal function and none cardiac. Patients with LVEF < 35% had more arrhythmias including nonsustained atrial tachycardia (P = 0.01), frequent premature ventricular contractions, ventricular couplets/triplets, and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (P < 0.001) compared to the other groups. LVEF < 35% (P < 0.001) was the only predictor of clinically significant Holter finding. Four patients (40%) had change in medication in the LVEF < 35% group compared to 9 (3%) in the ≥ 55% and 4 (4%) in the 35% to 54% groups (P < 0.001).

Conclusions

Sudden cardiac events are rare in DMD patients with an LVEF > 35%. Significant Holter findings are rare in patients with DMD who have an LVEF > 35%, and cardiac dysfunction appears to predict significant Holter findings. Holter monitoring is highest yield among DMD patients with cardiac dysfunction.

2. mHEALTH Technologies

Dedicated applications and sensors within or adjunctive to mobile communication devices enable users to monitor, collect, and share physiological and health data. Their applications range from diagnostic, decision support, disease management, evaluation of medication adherence, and for educational and clinical research purposes (Figure 1). They synergize naturally with arrhythmia evaluation and extend management to associated comorbidities and lifestyle.

Application of digital health technologies in arrhythmias (many of these sectors are interconnected).

Applications to Arrhythmias

Diagnostic Evaluate patients with symptoms suggestive of arrhythmias. Assess patients' response to both pharmacological and invasive treatment of arrhythmias.
Screening Increasing emphasis on AF.

2.1. Ambulatory ECG Monitoring

This is the cornerstone diagnostic method, and the choice of technique and time frame depend on whether symptoms (eg, palpitations and syncope) are present and how often they occur (Figure 2). Since the XXI century has become the era of the AF epidemic, the emphasis has shifted to screen for asymptomatic patients at high risk of developing AF or in those with cryptogenic stroke, to enable early treatment with the hope of preventing stroke and other serious complications. Novel tools expand the time window in which information can be gathered and overcome existing limitations with traditional methods, that is, intermittent physical exam or ECG for the detection of a largely asymptomatic arrhythmia.

Figure 2.
Mobile health (mHealth) devices for arrhythmia monitoring according to indications. Traditional wearable monitors are used for defined, short periods of time. Advantages are continuous monitoring and the ability to use multiple leads, which may be important for arrhythmia differentiation. These have been used historically for evaluation of palpitations, syncope, and defining QRS morphology. mHealth extends monitoring time indefinitely, to be defined by the user, and to the possibility of monitoring other parameters simultaneously with the ECG, and linking to machine learning. Typically, mHealth utilizes single-channel ECG or derived heart rate (HR) and discontinuous monitoring. AF indicates atrial fibrillation; BP, blood pressure; BrS, Brugada pattern; HF, heart failure; ILR, implantable loop recorder; and LQT, long QT.

Arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy — components of cardiovascular evaluation in at-risk relatives: Cardiovascular evaluation should include 12-lead ECG, ambulatory ECG, and cardiac imaging. Evaluation of all at-risk family members should include a 12-lead ECG, 24-hour Holter monitoring, and cardiac imaging, and in relatives who demonstrate disease features, electrocardiographic changes typically occur earlier and more commonly than structural changes; LGE on CMR, most frequently observed in the LV myocardium, was the first evidence of disease expression in a small subset.

Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) — diagnostic evaluation and monitoring: "As resting surface ECG is not helpful for the diagnosis of suspected CPVT, further electrocardiographic evaluation and provocative testing should be pursued". These tests "may include AECG monitoring to assess the presence of ventricular tachyarrhythmia during daily activities and emotional stress, and above all exercise stress test to evaluate relationship of ventricular arrhythmia with increased catecholamines". Ventricular ectopy "usually appears at a heart rate of 110–130 bpm". For treated patients, "Ambulatory ECG could be recommended as a measure of efficacy of drug treatment in patients with CPVT", and prior statements "recommended periodic AECG monitoring and exercise tests… although the presence of asymptomatic PVCs on Holter monitoring does not imply an unfavorable prognosis".

### Arrhythmia monitoring and outcomes in patients with cardiac sarcoidosis: insights from the cardiac sarcoidosis consortium [^115MrBPV]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

In this multicenter international registry, we describe arrhythmia outcomes along with the key role of 24‐hour Holter monitoring in detecting arrhythmic burden in patients with CS, identifying features warranting potential concern. Nevertheless, we observed that 24‐hour Holter is still an underused diagnostic tool as only 28% of patients with CS underwent Holter monitoring, and it could deserve wider application in everyday clinical practice.

This analysis has a potential selection bias, as arrhythmias were not evaluated in the same way within the enrolled population, and the patients who received Holter monitors might have a different arrhythmia propensity than those who were not monitored. Moreover, this analysis did not disclose the relationship between arrhythmias and patients' inflammatory milieu detected by imaging or laboratory tests and the potential influence of therapeutic strategies (eg, immunosuppressors). However, these data are hypothesis generating and encourage the research in CS to produce high‐quality evidence on arrhythmias' hallmarks and their parallelism with disease course. Ongoing randomized controlled trials such as CHASM CS (Cardiac Sarcoidosis Multi‐Center Randomized Controlled Trial; NCT03593759), evaluating the efficacy and safety of a combined methotrexate/prednisone therapy, and MAGIC ART (Interleukin‐1 Blockade for Treatment of Cardiac Sarcoidosis; NCT04017936), testing the effects and safety of interleukin‐1 blockade with anakinra, are leading the way forward to find more answers for arrhythmia management in this yet mysterious disease. Our data from the international prospective Cardiac Sarcoidosis Consortium add meaningful information from a large population with, shedding light on the association of arrhythmias with clinical outcomes in patients with CS.

### Parkinson's disease medication adjustments based on wearable device information compared to other methods: randomized clinical trial [^111gpwM5]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by motor fluctuations, with alternating periods of good ("ON") and poor ("OFF") motor function. Monitoring these fluctuations is crucial for optimizing treatment, yet traditional methods rely on subjective patient reports. This multicenter, single-blind, cluster-randomized trial evaluated the effectiveness of three monitoring approaches in real-world clinical practice. Neurologists from 35 centers were randomized into three groups: one using clinical visit data alone, another incorporating Hauser diary entries, and a third integrating Parkinson's Holter (STAT-ON®) reports. A total of 156 patients were recruited. Changes in 'OFF time' from baseline to 26 weeks were minimal and non-significant across groups. Secondary outcomes, including 'ON time', dyskinesia, and quality-of-life scores, showed no significant differences. These findings suggest that the choice of motor fluctuation monitoring method may not significantly impact clinical outcomes, underscoring the need for a broader understanding of how these monitoring tools are integrated and utilized in real-world settings.

### In-hospital ECG findings, changes in medical management, and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with acute stroke or transient ischemic attack [^116hf9j3]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

In patients with acute ischemic stroke, little is known regarding the frequency of abnormal ECG findings other than atrial fibrillation and their association with cardiovascular outcomes. We aim to analyze the frequency and type of abnormal ECG findings, subsequent changes in medical treatment, and their association with cardiovascular outcomes in patients with acute ischemic stroke.

Methods and Results

In the investigator‐initiated multicenter MonDAFIS (impact of standardized monitoring for detection of atrial fibrillation in ischemic stroke) study, 3465 patients with acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack and without known atrial fibrillation were randomized 1:1 to receive Holter‐ECG for up to 7 days in‐hospital with systematic evaluation in a core cardiology laboratory (intervention group) or standard diagnostic care (control group). Outcomes included predefined abnormal ECG findings (eg, pauses, atrial fibrillation, brady‐/tachycardias), medical management in the intervention group, and combined vascular end point (recurrent stroke, myocardial infarction, major bleeds, or all‐cause death) and mortality at 24 months in both randomization groups. Predefined abnormal ECG findings were detected in 326 of 1693 (19.3%) patients in the intervention group. Twenty of these 326 patients (6.1%) received a pacemaker, and 62 of 326 (19.0%) patients had newly initiated or discontinued β‐blocker medication. Discontinuation of β‐blockers was associated with a higher death rate in the control group than in the intervention group during 24 months after enrollment (adjusted hazard ratio, 11.0 [95% CI, 2.4–50.4]; P = 0.025 for interaction).

Conclusions

Systematic in‐hospital Holter ECG reveals abnormal findings in 1 of 5 patients with acute stroke, and mortality was lower at 24 months in patients with systematic ECG recording in the hospital. Further studies are needed to determine the potential impact of medical management of abnormal ECG findings.

Figure 4 — evaluation of patients presenting with palpitations — starts with "Is the arrhythmia documented" leading to "Specific treatment" if yes, or "12-lead ECG" if no, then a branch for "Preexcitation" that if present leads to "Suspect AVRT". A subsequent decision on "History of syncope" directs to "Sustained regular palpitations" if yes or "Irregular palpitations" if no, which then proceed to "Suspect atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter with variable AV conduction or multifocal atrial tachycardia" and "Holter and/or event monitor and follow-up". The figure also states "Refer to arrhythmia specialist if: Ablation indication; Wide complex tachycardia; Drug resistance or intolerance; Drug therapy is not desired; Severe symptoms (syncope, angor pectoris or dyspnea during palpitations)" and defines "AV, atrioventricular; AVRT, atrioventricular re-entrant tachycardia; ECG, electrocardiogram".

EHRA consensus — Holter monitoring recommendations for atrial tachyarrhythmia detection indicate that Holter monitoring "may be used as a step in screening strategy or in combination with other screening tools to improve detection of subclinical arrhythmia and to select candidates for long-term monitoring", and "Serial Holter monitoring may be considered if longer duration monitoring tools are not available". A fact statement adds that "ESVEA documented by Holter monitoring can be considered as a surrogate marker for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF)", with on-page abbreviations defining ESVEA as excessive supraventricular ectopic activity, AF as atrial fibrillation, CIED as cardiac implantable electronic device, and SAF as silent atrial fibrillation.

Ambulatory electrocardiography — Ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring is useful to evaluate whether symptoms, including palpitations, presyncope, or syncope, are caused by ventricular arrhythmias (VA) (Class I, B-NR). A 24-hour continuous Holter recording is appropriate when symptoms occur at least once a day or when quantitation of PVCs/nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) is desired, whereas event or "looping" monitors are more appropriate for sporadic symptoms. Adhesive patch monitors can record for weeks and allow continuous short-term 1-lead monitoring with patient activation; serial evaluations with exercise testing and/or 24-hour ambulatory monitoring are also used to assess rhythm burden and response of VA to therapy. When suspicion of VA is high, outpatient ambulatory monitoring is inappropriate, and it is important to accurately correlate symptoms with arrhythmias detected by ambulatory ECG monitoring.

ECG

Statistically significant increases in HR with FF/VI were also reported versus FP (differences between FF/VI and FP ranged from 4.1 bpm [95% CI 1.9 to 6.4] to 5.9 bpm [95% CI 3.3 to 8.5]; p < 0.001). Differences between FF/VI and FP in adjusted mean change from baseline in QTc(F) were –1.4 to 1.2 msec and none were statistically significant. Maximum post-baseline values and change from baseline in QTc(F) are summarised in table 4.

24-h Holter monitoring

Mean HR at post-baseline visits were similar to screening and no increases were reported; all groups had a slight decrease in HR with the greatest reduction reported on FP (5 bpm at Weeks 28 and 52 vs screening value; table 4). Approximately 50% of patients in each treatment group had no reported ventricular ectopics at screening (table 5). The median number of ventricular ectopics ranged from 0–1 across the treatment groups. The proportion of patients with > 50 ventricular ectopics (any type) and > 1 ventricular singlet was higher in the FF/VI groups compared with the FP group. The incidence of ≥ 1 ventricular couplet was low and generally similar across treatment groups. Non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT; > 100 bpm, 3−30 beats) was observed in two patients (2%) from each FF/VI group but not with FP. Sustained supraventricular tachycardia (> 100 bpm, > 30 beats) was only observed in the FF/VI 200/25 µg group (three patients [3%]). All events of NSVT and sustained supraventricular tachycardia resolved without treatment. Further information on the observed non-sustained and sustained tachycardia is reported in the online supplementary material.

### Ambulatory monitoring and arrhythmic outcomes in pediatric and adolescent patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy [^117So3d3]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy develop cardiac fibrosis and dilated cardiomyopathy. We described the frequency of significant Holter findings in, the relationship between cardiac function and arrhythmia burden, and the impact of these findings on clinical management.

Methods and Results

A retrospective review was done of patients withwho received a Holter from 2010 to 2014. Clinical and arrhythmic outcomes were analyzed. Patients were classified based on left ventricular ejection fraction: ≥ 55%, 35% to 54% and < 35%. Significant Holter findings included atrial tachycardia, ventricular tachycardia and atrial fibrillation/flutter. Logistic regression was used to assess predictors of significant Holter findings and change in care. The study included 442 Holters in 235 patients. Mean age was 14 ± 4 years. Patients with cardiac dysfunction were older, and had increased late gadolinium enhancement and left ventricular dilation (P < 0.01). There were 3 deaths (1%), all with normal function and none cardiac. Patients with < 35% had more arrhythmias including nonsustained atrial tachycardia (P = 0.01), frequent premature ventricular contractions, ventricular couplets/triplets, and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (P < 0.001) compared to the other groups. < 35% (P < 0.001) was the only predictor of clinically significant Holter finding. Four patients (40%) had change in medication in the < 35% group compared to 9 (3%) in the ≥ 55% and 4 (4%) in the 35% to 54% groups (P < 0.001).

Conclusions

Sudden cardiac events are rare inpatients with an > 35%. Significant Holter findings are rare in patients withwho have an > 35%, and cardiac dysfunction appears to predict significant Holter findings. Holter monitoring is highest yield amongpatients with cardiac dysfunction.

### KDOQI US commentary on the KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of CKD [^111LEsGK]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation detection and risk stratification in CKD — using symptoms, electrocardiograms, or Holter monitors underestimates the true burden of atrial fibrillation in this population because presentations may differ or overlap with CKD symptoms, and wearable devices may improve detection in high-risk patients. Regarding thromboembolic risk prediction, about 95% of people with eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 have a CHA2DS2-VASc score of ≥ 2, suggesting the score does not discriminate thromboembolism risk among persons with CKD.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Cardiac rhythm monitors (Table 6) — Holter monitoring provides continuous recording for 24–72 h; up to 2 wk with newer models and is selected when symptoms are frequent enough to be detected within a fairly short period (24–72 h) of monitoring. External loop recorders continuously record over weeks to months and can be patient activated or auto triggered to provide a recording of events antecedent to (3–14 min), during, and after (1–4 min) the triggered event, typically for frequent, spontaneous symptoms potentially related to bradycardia or conduction disorder, likely to recur within 2–6 wk. External patch recorders have various models that record from 2–14 d and can be considered as an alternative to external loop recorder. Mobile cardiac outpatient telemetry records and transmits data (up to 30 d) to a central monitoring station attended by trained technicians 24 h/d and is suited to spontaneous symptoms that are too brief, too subtle, or too infrequent to be readily documented with patient activated monitors, including high-risk patients whose rhythm requires real-time monitoring. Implantable cardiac monitors are subcutaneously implanted with a battery life of 2–3 y and are used for recurrent, infrequent, unexplained symptoms, potentially related to bradycardia or conduction disorder after a nondiagnostic initial workup, with or without structural heart disease.

### 2021 ISHNE / HRS / EHRA / APHRS collaborative statement on mHealth in arrhythmia management: digital medical tools for heart rhythm professionals: from the international society for holter and noninvasive electrocardiology / Heart Rhythm Society / European Heart Rhythm Association / Asia Pacific Heart Rhythm Society [^116DyiBr]. Journal of Arrhythmia (2021). High credibility.

mHealth in arrhythmia management is defined by the World Health Organization as medical and public health practice supported by mobile devices, such as mobile phones, patient monitoring devices, personal digital assistants (PDAs), and other wireless devices, and its utilization has proliferated among health-conscious consumers with likely continued expansion into formalized medical settings. Experience from remote monitoring of cardiovascular implantable electronic devices (CIEDs), such as pacemakers and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs), underpins this field, with a wealth of data from many studies over the last 10–15 years confirming the benefits of remote technology-assisted follow-up and establishing it as standard of care. However, results of remote monitoring of CIEDs may not be immediately generalizable to mHealth, as CIED remote monitoring is restricted to those with cardiac disease (largely arrhythmias and heart failure (HF)) and has well defined care pathways with billing and reimbursement in place in the United States and many other parts of the world. In contrast, mHealth differs by being widely available as consumer products that penetrate most sectors of society, including individuals without formal medical diagnoses; may be applied to a wider group of medical conditions; supports data that can be self-monitored rather than assessed by healthcare professionals (HCPs); and has reimbursement models that are not mature, with heart rhythm tracking capabilities sometimes indirectly acquired in products purchased for different goals and then used for self-monitoring. In the medical space, applications are largely not prescribed by HCPs, often lack validation for disease management use cases, and care pathways remain varied or poorly defined. If properly implemented, the intersection of these two communities opens opportunities ranging from population screening and surveillance for undiagnosed disease to longitudinal disease management, engaging patients in their own cycle of care and allowing much health care to be asynchronous and virtualized, with value and integration dependent on different healthcare systems in different countries.

### 2017 HRS / EHRA / ECAS / APHRS / SOLAECE expert consensus statement on catheter and surgical ablation of atrial fibrillation [^117S1RTM]. Heart Rhythm (2017). Low credibility.

Again, the purpose of the trial should be married to the type of monitoring performed. If the ultimate goal is to improve patients' QOL, then excessive monitoring for asymptomatic AF might not be worth the effort. However, if the goal is to reduce AF burden, or change prognosis, particularly from a stroke point of view, then continuous monitoring should be required.

In the past, the consensus statement has provided minimum clinical requirements for postablation monitoring for clinical trials. Initially, these were quite stringent, and in the last consensus statement, the requirements were made more flexible. The current consensus recommends the following minimum monitoring requirements: For PAF, follow-up screening should include a minimum of three visits (e.g. at 3, 6, and 12 months), with a 12-lead ECG at each visit, a 24-hour Holter at the end of the follow-up period (e.g. 12 months), and more limited event recording from the end of the 3-month blanking period to the end of follow-up (e.g. 12 months), both at regular periods and with patient activated recordings obtained at the time of symptoms (or equivalent). Follow-up beyond 1 year is encouraged and might occur every 6 months with Holter and ECG (or equivalent). For persistent and long-standing persistent AF, follow-up screening should include a minimum of three visits (e.g. at 3, 6, and 12 months), with a 12-lead ECG at each visit, a 24-hour Holter every 6 months, and event recording from the end of the 3-month blanking period to the end of follow-up (e.g. 12 months), as well as at the time of symptoms (or equivalent). Follow-up beyond 1 year is encouraged and might occur every 6 months with Holter and ECG (or equivalent) (Table 10). In making these recommendations, it is important to recognize that the writing group views these as minimal monitoring recommendations. More intensive follow-up with more frequent Holters and/or extended ECG monitoring is encouraged. Similarly, follow-up beyond 1 year is encouraged and might occur every 6 months with Holter and ECG (or equivalent). It is acknowledged that this recommendation falls short of continuous monitoring and will largely detect symptomatic recurrences with only a limited ability to detect asymptomatic recurrences. However, this minimum standard will at least provide some consistency in trial reporting, and trials are encouraged to exceed this standard where possible. Details are specified in Table 10.

### Routine electrocardiogram screening and cardiovascular disease events in adults [^112Gp3t9]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Our findings highlight the potential role of baseline minor ECG abnormalities. We identified an association of the presence and number of minor ECG abnormalities with the risk of incident CVD and the development of new major ECG abnormalities over time in a more generalizable population, supported by previous studies performed in limited populations. Our analysis further enabled a comprehensive distinction between minor ECG abnormalities associated with clinical outcomes and those that were not. While some major ECG abnormalities, such as atrial fibrillation, have indications for further diagnostics and possibly treatment, minor ECG abnormalities have often been overlooked, and there is currently no guideline recommendation specifically addressing the management of multiple minor ECG abnormalities. Thus, our findings could shed new light on the clinical importance of minor ECG abnormalities incidentally detected in health screening settings.

The critical challenge persists on whether appropriate interventions following the identification of high-risk cases by ECG are available. Although our findings indicate an association between ECG results and CVD events, they do not imply that ECG results themselves or additional interventions based on the ECG results mitigate the outcomes of CVD. In addition, there is a possibility that the observed increased risk of all-cause mortality among individuals with ECG abnormalities could be partially due to overtreatment, such as potentially unnecessary invasive procedures. Furthermore, effective intervention is not necessarily available for most of the ECG abnormalities despite their association of higher risk for CVD. Considering the low follow-up rate even in the major ECG abnormality group, providing mandatory ECG tests without a suboptimal follow-up strategy may be inadequate. In this context, it is imperative to assess the effectiveness of workup strategies for individuals with ECG abnormalities. For instance, adopting a personalized approach that considers both baseline CVD risks and ECG findings, along with the optimal follow-up examinations (eg, active monitoring using ECG, Holter monitors, echocardiography, and wearable devices), could potentially maximize the utility of ECG findings, which should be the subject of future research.

### Ambulatory monitoring and arrhythmic outcomes in pediatric and adolescent patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy [^113YxaPg]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Individual Patient

When assessing Holter data by each individual patient, similar results were found. Nonsustained atrial tachycardia and all ventricular arrhythmias (premature ventricular contractions, ventricular couplets, and triplets and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia) were more common among patients with LV dysfunction (Table 3). Significant Holter findings rarely occurred (5%) within the full cohort but increased in frequency as cardiac dysfunction progressed. Most notably, nonsustained atrial and nonsustained ventricular tachycardias were more common in patients with LV dysfunction. Initiation or change in antiarrhythmic medications was seen more frequently in patients with cardiac dysfunction.

Table 3
DMD Holter Characteristics (Per Patient Includes All Holters Per Patient)

Outcomes

LVEF < 35% was the only independent predictor of significant Holter findings via logistic regression analysis (odds ratio of 122 [versus EF ≥ 55%] and odds ratio of 7 [versus EF 35–54%] [P = 0.002]). Patients with symptoms as the indication for Holter were more likely to have significant Holter findings compared to those without symptoms. Holters were placed for clinical symptoms in 15 patients, most commonly for palpitations 11 (73%), of which 10 patients (67%) had clinical symptoms during the Holter. Significant Holter findings occurred more frequently when placed for symptoms 3 (20%) compared to 9 (2%) of asymptomatic Holters (P < 0.001). The Holter findings included nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, nonsustained atrial fibrillation, and supraventricular tachycardia when placed for symptoms. There was no difference in change in care, which occurred in 2 (13%) of Holters with symptoms compared to 15 (4%) asymptomatic Holters (P = 0.052). Holter monitoring resulted in change of care in 4% of all studies, all being initiation or change in medications, and was most commonly seen in patients with LVEF < 35%. Frequent premature ventricular contractions was an independent factor for change in care in logistic regression analysis (odds ratio 8.6, P < 0.001).

There were only 3 deaths (1%) within the study cohort. Of these 3 patients, all had normal cardiac function and none of the deaths were cardiac related (sepsis, respiratory failure, likely fat embolus after a fracture). No patients received an ICD during the study period.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) — prevalence, risk, and management implications are as follows: On 12-lead ECGs, PVCs were found in 0.6% of those < 20 years and 2.7% of those > 50 years, while longer term monitoring shows PVCs in about 50% of all people with or without heart disease; in ARIC, PVCs on 2 minutes of monitoring were associated with increased risk of both ischemic heart disease events and mortality; in the general population, frequent PVCs — defined as at least 1 PVC on a 12-lead ECG or > 30 PVCs per hour — are associated with increased cardiovascular risk and increased mortality; in a Taiwan cohort without sustained VT or structural heart disease undergoing 24-hour Holter evaluation, multifocal PVCs were associated with increased risk of death and nonfatal cardiovascular adverse outcomes and NSVT was independently associated with increased risk of death and other cardiovascular adverse outcomes, including stroke; PVCs were also associated with increased risk of stroke in ARIC; detection of PVCs, particularly if multifocal and frequent, is generally considered a risk factor and such patients are generally evaluated to exclude underlying conditions warranting treatment to reduce risk; in CAST, post–myocardial infarction patients taking antiarrhythmic medications (e.g., flecainide, encainide, moricizine) had increased risk of death despite suppression of ventricular arrhythmias; more broadly, treatment of PVCs with antiarrhythmic medications has not been shown to reduce mortality and, in post-MI patients, class I sodium channel–blocking medications (e.g., quinidine, flecainide) increase the risk of death; likewise, in reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), class I sodium channel–blocking medications and d-sotalol increase the risk of death.

Cardiac implantable electronic device (CIED) remote monitoring (RM) — initiation and patient engagement should account for individual and institutional factors; the system should be delivered as early as possible after implantation, yet many programs implement RM at the 1-week or 1-month visit, and failure to engage patients can undermine efficacy, with missed or duplicate transmissions impairing clinical efficiency; clinics expect patients to keep contact information current and inform the clinic of clinical events, hospitalizations, and drug changes.

### 2017 ISHNE-HRS expert consensus statement on ambulatory ECG and external cardiac monitoring / telemetry [^115WmoWe]. Heart Rhythm (2017). Medium credibility.

Suppression of ventricular arrhythmia by pharmacotherapy — Treatment of ventricular arrhythmia is sometimes utilized for relief of symptoms and/or suppression of frequent PVCs that cause left ventricular dysfunction, and suppression of arrhythmia should be considered when a reduction of 75% in isolated or coupled PVCs and 90% in VT episodes had been achieved, although this was based on repetitive 24-h Holter recordings and more recent data suggest that 24-h monitoring is not sufficient to reliably confirm suppression due to poor reproducibility. Routine AECG for detection of sinus node automaticity and/or AV conduction disturbances prior to drug administration or during follow-up should be performed in patients with symptoms suggestive of bradycardia–tachycardia syndrome or in those with clinical suspicion of side effects related to decrease in automaticity and conduction, and significant bradycardia in patients requiring heart rate lowering drugs may warrant pacemaker implantation. AECG monitoring may be useful to detect transient excessive QT prolongation, worrisome patterns of ventricular ectopy, or asymptomatic episodes of torsade de pointes VT, and in some cases hospitalization with continuous ECG telemetry to detect excessive QT prolongation may be recommended during drug initiation.

### In-hospital ECG findings, changes in medical management, and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with acute stroke or transient ischemic attack [^1149NehY]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

An open issue is how long and with which technique of ECG monitoring should be performed in patients with stroke. In the MonDAFIS study, we have shown that Holter ECG monitoring for up to 7 days in the hospital, evaluated in a core laboratory, can detect more AF than regular care in a certified stroke unit. Here, we show that, in addition, other abnormal ECG findings are detected that may be clinically relevant and lead to significant changes in medical management. We also believe that the cardiology consultation triggered by the abnormal ECG findings is an important element in the improved care of patients with stroke, although we cannot rule out the possibility that this simply reflects good clinical practice in a stroke unit by careful monitoring and prompting action when an abnormality is detected.

Our study has limitations. First, there was no systematic information on abnormal study ECG findings in the control group because standard diagnostics were not analyzed in the cardiology core laboratory. Second, changes in medication were assessed for the first time at 6 months after the index stroke. Hence, the effect on all‐cause mortality between randomization groups at 24 months can only be explained by extrapolation of the early changes, assuming a continued effect of the changes in medical management. Third, we have no information on changes in daily drug dose in patients who continued their β‐blocker therapy. Fourth, we cannot rule out bias based on indication because of a nonrandom treatment exposure. However, the types of β‐blocker therapy were similarly distributed in both randomization groups. In addition, the increased risk of mortality and CE in patients who discontinued β‐blocker therapy remained stable after multivariable adjustment. Furthermore, although cardiology work‐up was explicitly recommended for patients with abnormal ECG findings in the intervention group, we have no information on how frequently and timely cardiologists were consulted. It should be noted that the abnormal ECG findings were evaluated in a cardiology core laboratory. Unfortunately, apart from AF, we do not have information on abnormal ECG findings diagnosed in the control group. Furthermore, we have no information on abnormal ECG findings during routine diagnostic care in the intervention group in the hospital. Fifth, because of the small sample size for the reported exposures of β‐blocker discontinuation (n = 112) and tachycardia on admission (n = 162), a chance finding cannot be excluded. Sixth, even though we cautiously conclude from our data that informed medical management of patients based on the specific ECG findings may have positively influenced their outcome, the design of our post hoc analysis limits any conclusions regarding causality. Finally, the observed difference in mortality rates between the 2 study groups may be because of informative censoring (ie, when study patients were lost to follow‐up because of reasons related to the study). However, a comparison of the baseline characteristics of patients who dropped out of the study (for reasons other than death) during the 24‐month follow‐up period showed that there was no difference between the 2 randomization groups (data not shown).

Europace (2012). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation ablation — available methods for arrhythmia monitoring include non-continuous or continuous electrocardiogram (ECG) tools, with more intensive monitoring associated with a greater likelihood of detecting both symptomatic and asymptomatic AF; AF burden assessment with intermittent monitoring improves with increasing frequency or duration but more complex and longer methods lower patient compliance; non-continuous options include scheduled or symptom-initiated ECGs, Holter (24 hours to 7 days), transtelephonic recordings, patient and automatically activated devices, and external loop recorders; scheduled 7-day Holter or daily patient-activated event recordings are estimated to document approximately 70% of AF recurrences.

Reduced Costs

This technology may promote an effective means for early diagnosis and treatment of arrhythmias and associated comorbidities, leading to benefits of screening, prevention, and early treatment, thereby reducing adverse effects related to delayed therapy and utilization of costly health care resources (eg, ER visits or hospitalizations). mHealth may help individuals adhere to health recommendations, empower active participation in lifestyle changes to modify cardiovascular risk profile, and promote adherence to medical therapy (Feldman 2018). Together, these may reduce the burden of chronic disease and associated long-term disability. However, assessment of these longer term cost advantages is challenging, and value will vary according to country and health care system.

Increased Costs

Conversely, there are costs associated with administering mHealth programs. The widespread availability of smartphones and other commercially available mobile devices will generate a significant amount of inconclusive or false-positive findings, which will in turn lead to additional testing for validation, thereby increasing utilization of health care resources. Widespread implementation of screening programs would require additional consideration of costs related to detection of arrhythmias in currently unscreened populations. Health care providers will also be required to spend time reviewing and interpreting potentially voluminous results (and associated phone calls) before making additional evaluation and management decisions. This requires financial compensation to maintain a viable practice.

RM of Implanted Devices

This provides valuable experience. Randomized clinical trials conducted over many years that demonstrated safe and effective replacement of traditional in-clinic evaluations and more effective discovery of asymptomatic clinical events (Varma 2010). Health-economic studies like EuroEco (ICD patients) showed that clinic time needed for checking web-based information, telephone contacts, and in-clinic discussion when required was balanced by fewer planned in-office visits with RM, resulting in a similar cost for hospitals versus purely in-office follow-up (Heidbuchel 2014). From a payer perspective, there was a trend for cost-saving given fewer and shorter hospitalizations, seen also in other trials (Crossley 2011, Guedon-Moreau 2014, Hindricks 2014, Mabo 2012). – However, in systems with fee-for-service reimbursement, less in-office visits (and hospitalizations) will lead to less income for the providers (ie, physicians and hospitals) without adaption of the new RM paradigm. This illustrates the complexities in reimbursement.

### Parkinson's disease medication adjustments based on wearable device information compared to other methods: randomized clinical trial [^111K9kkq]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by motor fluctuations, with alternating periods of good ("ON") and poor ("OFF") motor function. Monitoring these fluctuations is crucial for optimizing treatment, yet traditional methods rely on subjective patient reports. This multicenter, single-blind, cluster-randomized trial evaluated the effectiveness of three monitoring approaches in real-world clinical practice. Neurologists from 35 centers were randomized into three groups: one using clinical visit data alone, another incorporating Hauser diary entries, and a third integrating Parkinson's Holter (STAT-ON®) reports. A total of 156 patients were recruited. Changes in 'OFF time' from baseline to 26 weeks were minimal and non-significant across groups. Secondary outcomes, including 'ON time', dyskinesia, and quality-of-life scores, showed no significant differences. These findings suggest that the choice of motor fluctuation monitoring method may not significantly impact clinical outcomes, underscoring the need for a broader understanding of how these monitoring tools are integrated and utilized in real-world settings.

### Real-time ambulatory ECG does not expedite care [^113bLqxs]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Ambulatory cardiac monitoring strategies have evolved substantially, and this is an area of great interest to potentially improve the timeliness of the treatment of actionable arrhythmias. Prior groups have explored diagnostic yields for different studies and specific vendors, as well as downstream health care costs. We believe ours is the first to examine specific, time‐to‐event outcomes reflecting clinically impactful or actionable arrhythmia findings. We found modest differences in timing of outcomes among patients monitored with real‐time results (non‐Holter), compared with those using traditional Holter test — in general and contrary to expected, real‐time ambulatory monitoring patients did not undergo cardiac procedures sooner and did not present to emergency department or hospitalization sooner, though there was a favorable trend toward earlier initiation of oral anticoagulation among patients with real‐time monitoring. These aggregate results have several implications when considering the broad use of these monitoring technologies.

First, when considering these data, it is critical to consider that the monitor is just one part of the health care system responsible for assessing and treating heart rhythms. There are also potential delays in contacting patients, scheduling procedures, etc, which can offset some of the benefits of real‐time detection. Anticoagulation prescription may have been less affected by these other potential delay sources as it requires fewer steps to complete. However, these potential systemwide delay points do not explain all of the lack of benefit of the observed results as more significant arrhythmias detected by real‐time monitoring should have prompted greater rates of urgent treatment or evaluation such as emergency department evaluation.

The lack of statistical differences for many of these outcomes between real‐time and traditional monitors suggests that the cost‐effectiveness of real‐time monitoring may be inadequate to justify use among broad patient groups in which event rates of actionable arrhythmias are less on average. Judicious implementation of this technology may reduce health care costs and burden, including the personnel costs associated with real‐time review, interpretation, and care coordination. Moving forward, it will be vital to identify higher risk patients most likely to benefit from real‐time monitoring, compared with traditional monitoring.

2012 HRS/EHRA/ECAS atrial fibrillation ablation — follow-up and ECG monitoring guidance states that ECGs should be obtained at all follow-up visits, and that more intense monitoring should be mainly driven by the clinical impact of atrial fibrillation (AF) detection with stricter monitoring when thromboembolic risk factors influence anticoagulation; initial screening tools include manually activated event recorders and pulse checks, with a one- to seven-day Holter monitor to detect frequent asymptomatic recurrences and a four-week auto-trigger event monitor, mobile cardiac outpatient telemetry, or an implantable subcutaneous monitor to identify less frequent AF; continuous ECG monitoring may be performed for a long period (one, two, or more years) using implantable pacemakers or defibrillators with atrial leads with a cut-off of arrhythmia duration ≥ 5 minutes, and long-term subcutaneous implantable loop monitors can analyze R-R intervals over a time period of two years.

### In-hospital ECG findings, changes in medical management, and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with acute stroke or transient ischemic attack [^116qxovU]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Patients with ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) often have concomitant heart disease and are susceptible to stroke‐related cardiac injury, and a substantial proportion of them die during follow‐up. Therefore, the identification of patients with stroke at high risk for cardiovascular events is of paramount importance. Several studies have shown that prolonged ECG monitoring has an impact on guiding secondary stroke prevention by detecting atrial fibrillation (AF). Previous prospective studies investigating the detection of AF using prolonged ECG monitoring in patients with acute stroke (without known AF) focused primarily on the detection of AF and not on additional abnormal ECG findings that might have influenced rate and rhythm management and eventually cardiovascular outcomes. Thus, it is unclear whether the detection of ECG findings besides AF during prolonged ECG monitoring is associated with cardiovascular outcomes.

In the MonDAFIS (impact of standardized monitoring for detection of atrial fibrillation in ischemic stroke) study, 3465 patients with acute ischemic stroke or TIA were randomized to either systematic Holter‐ECG monitoring (up to 7 days in‐hospital) in addition to standard diagnostic care (intervention group) or standard of care alone (control group). While systematic ECG monitoring had no statistically significant effect on anticoagulation rates 12 months after the index stroke (primary end point) and the combined vascular end point (recurrent stroke, myocardial infarction, major bleeds, or all‐cause death at 6,12, and 24 months after the index stroke), there was a statistically significant decrease in deaths in the intervention group (hazard ratio, 0.7 [95%CI, 0.5–0.9], P = 0.017), which could not be explained by fewer recurrent strokes.

Here, we present data on the frequency and type of predefined abnormal ECG findings of extended ECG monitoring in the intervention group. Specifically, we analyzed whether these findings prompted (1) additional ECGs during follow‐up, (2) pacemaker implantation during follow‐up, or (3) changes in medical rate and rhythm management (specifically β‐blocker therapy). Finally, we investigated a potential association between a change in medical rate and rhythm management in patients with abnormal study ECG findings and the combined end point or death and compared the results with the control group, which did not receive systematic ECG monitoring.

4.2. Heart Failure

HF is widely prevalent, costly to manage, and degrades patient outcomes (Benjamin 2017, Albert 2019). HF may trigger AF and ventricular arrhythmias. Conversely, AF may precipitate HF. RM of, for example, dietary and medication adherence (Section 4.6.2), detection of arrhythmias (Section 3), intercurrent ischemia (Section 4.1), orthopnea, changes in HR, activity, and sleep (Section 4.5), may enable remote adjustment of management to reduce emergency department visits and unplanned HF-related hospitalizations. If scalable, RM coupled with mobile communication could prove to reduce costs associated with HF.

Despite promise, most large, multicenter randomized trials failed to demonstrate improved outcomes of RM in patients with HF (Table 4; Boyne 2012, Chaudhry 2010, Dickinson 2018, Koehler 2011, Ong 2016, Stehlik 2020, Takahashi 2012). – Combination algorithms based on multiple parameters may be valuable (Ono 2017). One trial stands out. The TIM-HF2 trial (Telemedical Interventional Management in Heart Failure II) randomized patients with HF to either remote patient management plus usual care or to usual care only and was followed up for over a year (Koehler 2018). The results showed reduction in the combined end point of percentage of days lost due to unplanned hospitalization and all-cause mortality. However, cardiovascular mortality was similar between RM and standard care groups. Implanted devices that monitor pulmonary arterial pressure may be beneficial in select patients when used in structured programs (Dickinson 2018). The positive findings of the CHAMPION trial (CardioMEMS Heart Sensor Allows Monitoring of Pressure to Improve Outcomes in NYHA Functional Class III Heart Failure Patients) and subsequent FDA approval have renewed interest in remote patient management for patients with HF (Abraham 2016, Carbo 2018, Desai 2017). – This requires daily download of hemodynamic data and a prespecified medical treatment plan. An app is also available that illustrates patient compliance with monitoring, alerts the patient when transmissions are not received, shows medication reminders, and allows for medication reconciliation and titration.

### Can we improve outcomes in AF patients by early therapy? [^1161iicX]. BMC Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Can earlier diagnosis of AF help to prevent AF-related complications?

It is very likely that, in addition to the patients with known AF, a large number of additional patients suffer from undiagnosed, silent AF. An active search for AF in patients at risk for the arrhythmia may allow diagnosis of silent AF before the first complication occurs. While conventional Holter electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings have a low diagnostic yield for paroxysmal AF, newer technologies like patient-operated or telemetric ECG systems, long-term Holter monitors, or even implanted ECG monitors carry the promise of allowing an early diagnosis of silent AF. Early diagnosis of AF would not only allow the early initiation of rate and rhythm control therapy, but could also help to prevent AF-related complications, for example, by timely initiation of antithrombotic therapy.

Can rhythm control therapy be delivered safely?

Early therapy of AF, especially therapy aiming at preventing complications rather than alleviating symptoms, needs to be reasonably safe, and actually safer than therapy that is demanded by a suffering patient. Safety has, however, been a major consideration in antiarrhythmic drug therapy. One example is the AFFIRM trial population in which presence of sinus rhythm during follow-up associated with better survival, while therapy with antiarrhythmic drugs associated with earlier death. One potential way to resolve this difficulty is to limit antiarrhythmic drug therapies to periods when their effects are really needed. Another perspective may be to develop new, safer antiarrhythmic agents. At present, the safety profile of catheter ablation of AF in relation to its efficacy has not been clearly delineated: Success rates are high, especially in paroxysmal AF patients, but complication rates are not negligible, and although most complications can be managed without long-term sequelae, there is a residual death rate induced by AF ablation.

Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Outcomes

These are key to adoption and reimbursement. More specifically, the clinical and prognostic impact of new outcome measures based on mHealth technologies may not be clear.

This is important for AF. For example, how do changes in AF burden compare to reductions in time to symptomatic sustained AF? Should AF identified on near-continuous smartwatch monitoring be considered equivalent to AF diagnosed at hospitalization or in clinic? There is a growing body of literature that the dose of AF burden matters for a variety of important clinical end points, including stroke, HF, and death (Section 3.1.3; Chen 2018, Glotzer 2009, Kaplan 2019, Piccini 2019, Wong 2018). – Does pill-in-the-pocket direct oral anticoagulant treatment of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation adequately cover the risk of stroke? Some measures remain less well studied, like the occurrence of irregularity with a wearable pulse-based monitor system, particularly without ECG confirmation.

Since these mHealth prediagnostic or diagnostic tools may then be directly tied to initiation or termination of treatment, rigorous evaluation of clinical safety and efficacy will be required and in some cases, warrant a combined drug-device regulatory approval.

Despite these challenges, there is enormous potential for patients to use these technologies to self-monitor their arrhythmia treatment and extend this to manage comorbidities (Section 4). The process of data transparency and accessibility to the patient may improve the patient's engagement with their overall care, even if the data are not directly actionable by the patient. The restriction to clinic access during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has accelerated the adoption of mHealth solutions (Varma 2020).ECGs for clinical trials were recorded by smart devices and assessed at virtual visits instead of routine in-person evaluations. In some cases, the entire management of clinical trials went online.

### Detection of unknown atrial fibrillation by prolonged ECG monitoring in an all-comer patient cohort and association with clinical and holter variables [^114tDQWE]. Open Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Seven-day Holter ECG monitoring detects unknown AF in around 9% of patients with various symptoms in an open access, 'all-comer' setting, suggesting that this is a useful diagnostic approach to enhance detection of unknown AF. Risk factor analysis for paroxysmal AF and systematic evaluations of treatment and outcomes after AF screening are needed to define populations for screening silent AF. Comparable AF detection rates between cardiology and primary care also supports provision of ECG monitoring using open-access services across various healthcare sectors.

Point-of-care use of mHealth in arrhythmia management — the next step beyond parameterizing safety could be to actionably guide therapy at the point of care, for example, patients could obtain ECGs before and after taking "pill-in-the-pocket" antiarrhythmic drug therapy such as flecainide to confirm AF, ensure no QRS widening, and confirm restoration of sinus rhythm. A similar approach has been proposed for rhythm-guided use of direct oral anticoagulants (OACs) in lower-risk AF patients with infrequent episodes, and a randomized trial is in development. The use of smartwatch-guided rate control as a treatment strategy could also be tested to provide a more personalized approach than prior randomized trials that used population level rather than personalized heart rate treatment thresholds.

Clinical evaluation in atrial fibrillation (AF) — additional testing: One or several tests may be necessary, including a Six-minute walk test if the adequacy of rate control is in question; exercise testing if the adequacy of rate control is in question (permanent AF), to reproduce exercise-induced AF, and to exclude ischemia before treatment of selected patients with a type IC antiarrhythmic drug; Holter monitoring or event recording if diagnosis of the type of arrhythmia is in question and as a means of evaluating rate control; transesophageal echocardiography to identify LA thrombus (in the LA appendage) and to guide cardioversion; electrophysiological study to clarify the mechanism of wide-QRS-complex tachycardia, to identify a predisposing arrhythmia such as atrial flutter or paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, and to seek sites for curative ablation or AV conduction block/modification; and chest radiograph to evaluate lung parenchyma and pulmonary vasculature when clinical findings suggest an abnormality.

QT variability (QTV) and dynamics — QTV measures variations in QT interval length to assess repolarization, with studies using approximately 15 different measures and being performed at constant heart rates to avoid heart rate correction; QTV studies have enrolled ∼3,500 individuals. Important limitations include the facts that (1) normative QTV values have not been established; (2) there are no agreed cutpoints indicating elevated risk; and (3) QTV studies do not provide evidence of its capacity to guide therapy. The principal and better established methods are as follows: (1) the circadian profile of the rate-corrected QT interval (QTc); (2) long-term evaluation of the QT-RR relationship; and (3) the QT variability index.

Atrial fibrillation — diagnostic investigations require ECG documentation by at least a single-lead recording during the arrhythmia, which may be facilitated by emergency department records, Holter monitoring, or transtelephonic or telemetric recordings; a portable ECG tool may help in paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and devices with diagnostic and memory functions may allow accurate and automatic detection. A chest radiograph may detect enlargement of the cardiac chambers and heart failure but is valuable mostly to detect intrinsic pulmonary pathology and to evaluate the pulmonary vasculature, and it is less important than echocardiography for routine evaluation. As part of the initial evaluation, all patients with atrial fibrillation should have 2-dimensional, Doppler echocardiography to assess LA and LV dimensions, LV wall thickness and function, and to exclude occult valvular or pericardial disease and HCM; LV systolic and diastolic performance helps guide decisions regarding antiarrhythmic and antithrombotic therapy, and thrombus should be sought in the LA but is seldom detected without TEE.

Rhythm and Rate Control

Rhythm.

While we await data on OAC treatment for mHealth-detected AF, the finding of the arrhythmia should initiate mHealth monitoring of NSR retention, QT intervals, important for those on some antiarrhythmic drugs (Garabelli 2016), and discussion of cardiovascular risk factor modification and lifestyle changes, since AF coexists with comorbidities that may influence its occurrence and natural history (Section 4). Thus, alcohol reduction, treatment of OSA, moderate exercise, and weight loss have been shown to reduce AF burden (Congrete 2018, Kanagala 2003, Pathak 2015, Voskoboinik 2020). –

Rate.

While the primary goal of rate control is to minimize AF-related symptoms, prolonged tachycardia can result in effort intolerance or tachycardia-mediated cardiomyopathy while excessively low heart rate targets may increase the risk of bradyarrhythmias that result in symptoms and device implantation. The European Society of Cardiology recommends lenient resting HR targets (< 100–110), whereas the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association/HRS guidelines recommend a target rate of < 80 beats per minute. Often these targets are tailored to the individual patient based on symptoms and presence or propensity for HF. mHealth technologies can be used to assess ventricular rates during AF over long time periods and evaluate the effects of rate-control therapies (January 2019, Kirchhof 2016).

3.2. Sudden Cardiac Death

Ventricular Arrhythmias

The use of mHealth technology to diagnose ventricular arrhythmias lags behind its application to AF (Sections 3.1 and 4.1). Detection of symptomatic ventricular tachycardia has been reported using the AliveCor cardiac monitor (AliveCor, San Francisco, CA) and SmartWatch (Ringwald 2019, Waks 2015). Sophisticated automated analysis of a 2-minute photoplethysmography recording by the camera of a commercially available smartphone (iPhone 4S; Apple) can distinguish between AF, premature atrial complexes, and PVCs from sinus rhythm, with a sensitivity of 0.733 and specificity of 0.976 for PVCs (Chong 2015, McManus 2016). PVCs may challenge to photoplethysmography-based systems, as many PVCs are nonperfusing (Billet 2019). An ECG tracing is, therefore, essential to facilitate rhythm diagnosis and avoid misclassification of slow photoplethysmography pulse rates (bradysphygmia) simply as bradycardia.

Journal of Arrhythmia (2021). High credibility.

Heart failure remote monitoring — heart failure is widely prevalent, costly, and degrades outcomes; atrial fibrillation (AF) and heart failure (HF) can precipitate each other; remote monitoring of dietary and medication adherence, arrhythmia detection, intercurrent ischemia, orthopnea, and changes in heart rate, activity, and sleep may enable remote management adjustments to reduce emergency department visits and unplanned HF-related hospitalizations and could reduce costs; most large multicenter randomized trials have failed to show improved outcomes of remote monitoring, though combination algorithms may be valuable; the TIM-HF2 trial randomized HF patients to remote patient management plus usual care versus usual care only and were followed up for over a year, showing a reduction in the combined endpoint of percentage of days lost due to unplanned hospitalization and all-cause mortality while cardiovascular mortality was similar; implanted devices monitoring pulmonary arterial pressure may be beneficial in select cohorts within structured programs, and positive CHAMPION trial findings with subsequent FDA approval renewed interest, which requires daily hemodynamic data download and a prespecified medical treatment plan.

### Quinidine gluconate [^11792Pi3]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Reduction in the frequency of relapse into atrial fibrillation/flutter

In a patient with a history of frequent symptomatic episodes of atrial fibrillation/flutter, the goal of therapy with quinidine gluconate should be an increase in the average time between episodes. In most patients, the tachyarrhythmia will recur during therapy with quinidine gluconate, and a single recurrence should not be interpreted as therapeutic failure.

Especially in patients with known structural heart disease or other risk factors for toxicity, initiation or dose-adjustment of treatment with quinidine gluconate should generally be performed in a setting where facilities and personnel for monitoring and resuscitation are continuously available. Monitoring should be continued for two or three days after initiation of the regimen on which the patient will be discharged.

Therapy with quinidine gluconate should be begun with one tablet (324 mg; 202 mg of quinidine base) every eight or twelve hours. If this regimen is well tolerated, if the serum quinidine level is still well within the laboratory's therapeutic range, and if the average time between arrhythmic episodes has not been satisfactorily increased, then the dose may be cautiously raised. The total daily dosage should be reduced if the QRS complex widens to 130% of its pre-treatment duration; the QTcinterval widens to 130% of its pre-treatment duration and is then longer than 500 ms; P waves disappear; or the patient develops significant tachycardia, symptomatic bradycardia, or hypotension.

Suppression of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias

Dosing regimens for the use of quinidine gluconate in suppressing life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias have not been adequately studied. Described regimens have generally been similar to the regimen described just above for the prophylaxis of symptomatic atrial fibrillation/flutter. Where possible, therapy should be guided by the results of programmed electrical stimulation and/or Holter monitoring with exercise.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation — initial clinical assessment emphasizes that diagnosis is based on history and clinical examination and confirmed by electrocardiogram (ECG) recording, sometimes in the form of bedside telemetry or ambulatory Holter recordings, and that initial evaluation involves characterizing the arrhythmia pattern as paroxysmal or persistent, determining its cause, and defining associated cardiac and extracardiac factors pertinent to the etiology, tolerability, or history of prior management. A thorough history will result in a well-planned, focused workup that serves as an effective guide to therapy, and the workup can usually take place during a single outpatient encounter, with delay when the rhythm has not been specifically documented and additional monitoring is necessary. Commonly mentioned triggers include alcohol, sleep deprivation, and emotional stress, and stimulants such as caffeine or exercise may also precipitate atrial fibrillation. The physical examination may suggest atrial fibrillation on the basis of irregular pulse, irregular jugular venous pulsations, and variation in the intensity of the first heart sound or absence of a fourth sound heard previously during sinus rhythm, and examination may also disclose associated valvular heart disease, myocardial abnormalities, or heart failure.

Reduction of Frequency of Relapse Into Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter

In a patient with a history of frequent symptomatic episodes of atrial fibrillation/flutter, the goal of therapy with quinidine sulfate should be an increase in the average time between episodes. In most patients, the tachyarrhythmia will recur during therapy with quinidine sulfate, and a single recurrence should not be interpreted as therapeutic failure.

Especially in patients with known structural heart disease or other risk factors for toxicity, initiation or dose-adjustment of treatment with quinidine sulfate should generally be performed in a setting where facilities and personnel for monitoring and resuscitation are continuously available. Monitoring should be continued for two or three days after initiation of the regimen on which the patient will be discharged.

Therapy with quinidine sulfate should be begun with 200 mg (equivalent to 166 mg of quinidine base) every six hours. If this regimen is well tolerated, if the serum quinidine level is still well within the laboratory's therapeutic range, and if the average time between arrhythmic episodes has not been satisfactorily increased, then the dose may be cautiously raised. The total daily dosage should be reduced if the QRS complex widens to 130% of its pretreatment duration; the QTCinterval widens to 130% of its pretreatment duration and is then longer than 500 ms; P waves disappear; or the patient develops significant tachycardia, symptomatic bradycardia, or hypotension.

### Effectiveness of pharmacist's intervention in the management of cardiovascular diseases [^11496EdP]. Open Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Pharmacy services for patients with cardiovascular disease

Pharmacy services provided to patients with cardiovascular disease may be roughly classified into three groups: activities directed at patients, activities directed at healthcare professionals and those provided within the frame of a multidisciplinary teamwork. A simplified list of most common services is provided in box 1.

Box 1
Pharmacy services for cardiovascular prevention and management

Educational activities directed at patients ­Patient education and counselling Drug safety management
Informative activities directed at healthcare professionals ­Documenting adverse drug reactions occurring to the patients ­Monitoring patient's adherence to physician's prescription
Direct intervention in a multidisciplinary team ­Collaborative medication management (including drug administration) ­Medication review and dose adjustment or titration ­Medication monitoring and reconciliation ­Definition and application of disease management pathways and protocols Detection, prevention or control of specific cardiovascular risk factors ­Monitoring patients' outcomes Posthospital discharge follow-up and home visits for critical patients

Patient education and counselling about medication, diseases and non-pharmacological treatment (including indication on appropriate lifestyle) are traditional pharmacist's activities. These services are aimed at improving patient knowledge and at promoting the correct use of medicines, favouring the adherence to treatment and preserving a healthy status. The pharmacist also needs to assess possible issues related to drug safety in treated patients, providing specific advises and documenting such occurrences to the physician in charge of the patient. However, the most interesting and potentially successful and useful activities which a pharmacist may accomplish are those involving a direct intervention in a multidisciplinary team: the potentiality of such an approach will be addressed and discussed in detail in the present paper. Team-based multidisciplinary services include medication review and drug therapy adjustments, in which the pharmacist has the autonomy to manage medicines according to predefined clinical protocols or collaborative agreements with the physician, and elaboration or refinement of a complete and reliable medication history and therapeutic reconciliation following hospital discharge and follow-up. Of particular interest is the development of structured programmes for detection, prevention or control of specific risk factors, including measurement of blood pressure, blood glucose and lipids, and provision of diagnostic tests with medical reporting, such as 12-lead resting ECG, 24 hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring or 24 hour ECG Holter monitoring, through telemedicine tools, in connection with providers of medical reporting services.

### Antiarrhythmic drugs-clinical use and clinical decision making: a consensus document from the European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA) and European Society of Cardiology (ESC) working group on cardiovascular pharmacology, endorsed by the Heart Rhythm Society (HRS), Asia-Pacific Heart Rhythm Society (APHRS) and international society of cardiovascular pharmacotherapy (ISCP) [^1118sQyX]. Europace (2018). Medium credibility.

Antiarrhythmic drug monitoring — clinical assessment and risk balancing: In patients with arrhythmias, it could be necessary to "periodically evaluate the clinical status of the patients" and "it is mandatory to take into account symptoms and the risk profile of the patient". The document adds that "it is necessary to balance the arrhythmic risk of the patient and the risk caused by therapy" and that "monitoring of therapeutic drug concentrations in serum is required for some drugs with a narrow therapeutic range". It specifies that "Determination of drug level concentration is appropriate if the drug has a narrow therapeutic evidence-based range, marked inter- or intra-individual PK variability exists, there is no appropriate direct measure of desired therapeutic effect but a suitable and accessible laboratory assay", and broader evaluation should include electrophysiologic and clinical factors because "it is necessary to consider the spatial or temporal dispersion of repolarization as well as PR and QRS intervals, PKs, PDs, comorbidities, concomitant drugs, and side effects". Proarrhythmia risk can be drug-facilitated, as "Antiarrhythmic drugs, antibiotics, antipsychotic, and antidepressant groups are the most well-known groups that might generate proarrhythmia".

Heart Rhythm (2019). High credibility.

Table 6. Cardiac rhythm monitors — device features and patient selection are summarized as follows: Smartphone-based systems "can record a rhythm strip when the patient has symptoms or continuously depending on the technology". A Holter monitor provides "continuous recording for 24–72 h; up to 2 wk with newer models" and is selected when there are "symptoms frequent enough to be detected within a short period (24–72 h) of monitoring". A patient‑activated, transtelephonic event monitor is suited for "frequent, spontaneous symptoms likely to recur within 2–6 wk". An external loop recorder "continuously records and stores rhythm data over weeks to months" and captures events antecedent "(3–14 min)… and after (∼1–4 min) the triggered event", with selection for "frequent, spontaneous symptoms potentially related to bradycardia or conduction disorder; likely to recur within 2–6 wk". External patch recorders have "various models [that] record from 2–14 d" and "can be considered as an alternative to external loop recorder". Mobile cardiac outpatient telemetry records and transmits data "(up to 30 d)" with monitoring "attended by trained technicians 24 h/d", and is used for "spontaneous symptoms, potentially related to bradycardia or conduction disorder, that are too brief, too subtle, or too infrequent to be readily documented with patient activated monitors" and "in high‑risk patients whose rhythm requires real-time monitoring". An implantable cardiac monitor is a "subcutaneously implanted device, with a battery life of 2–3 y", selected for "recurrent, infrequent, unexplained symptoms, potentially related to bradycardia or conduction disorder after a nondiagnostic initial workup, with or without structural heart disease".

### Association between exposure to efavirenz and substrates of dysrhythmia in HIV-infected young adults [^117FQxK5]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

2.2 Study design

A retrospective cohort scheme was accomplished among HIV infected patients aged under the age 40. We sought to investigate the presence of any clinically significant dysrhythmias or their precursor conditions. Hence; all patients who agreed to sign informed consent were visited at cardiology clinic. A comprehensive clinical history regarding cardiovascular disease, medications, hospital admissions, family history of cardiac disorders including sudden arrest was obtained. Thereafter a relevant physical examination accompanied with performing echocardiography were conducted. An ECG Holter monitoring was performed for 24 hours in all participants to evaluate the prevalence of dysrhythmia. All patients were using ART medications while we performed Holter monitoring and the therapeutic regimens continued thereafter. Participants were instructed not to consume caffeine since 24 hours before ECG Holter monitoring. Moreover, they were asked to have their casual daily activities and to avoid moderate or vigorous exercise as well as anxiety. An independent electrophysiologist with collaboration of a cardiologist performed interpretation of 24 hour‐ECG Holter monitoring results. All patients were assessed over a period of 1 month. Baseline laboratory tests such as HIV viral load and CD4 count were collected using the database of our HIV research center. Viral load (as copy numbers) and CD4 counts are markers that help to evaluate the efficacy of treatment and to adjust for the effect of the disease phase. All patients underwent echocardiographic evaluation at baseline and after Holter‐monitoring in order to detect any considerable structural heart disease.

### Do statins influence the prognostic impact of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia after ST-elevation myocardial infarction? [^114x8CBc]. European Heart Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Aims

The study evaluates the effect of statin therapy on the prognostic impact of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) occurring after acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).

Methods and Results

From the German Acute Coronary Syndrome Registry (ACOS), 3137 patients with STEMI and in-hospital Holter monitoring were analysed. Three hundred and forty-six (11.0%) patients had NSVT. When compared with patients with no documented NSVT, patients with NSVT were older, more often had myocardial infarction in their history, diabetes mellitus, and an ejection fraction < 40%. Regarding frequency of drug application, medication at discharge did not (beta-blockers, ACE-inhibitors, amiodarone) or only slightly (acetylsalicylic acid, statins, and sotalol) differ between both groups. Multivariable analysis of 1 year mortality, adjusted for age, gender, diabetes, reperfusion therapy, ejection fraction < 40%, and beta-blocker therapy showed the following results: In patients without statin treatment and no NSVT, 1 year mortality after STEMI was 9.2%, but increased to 25.0% [odds ratio (OR) 3.02; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.47–6.20], if NSVT were present. In patients on statin treatment and no NSVT, 1 year mortality was only 3.2%, and in the presence of NSVT 1 year mortality was not significantly increased anymore (5.3%; OR 1.03; 95% CI 0.55–1.92).

Conclusion

After STEMI, only in patients not on statin treatment, the occurrence of NSVT is associated with a significant and marked increase in 1 year mortality.

### Experience with holter monitoring during propranolol therapy for infantile hemangiomas [^117LnKRZ]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Although adverse events in children treated with propranolol have proven rare, the appropriate methods of assessing cardiovascular risk and monitoring for toxicity when the medication is used for infantile hemangiomas remain unclear.

Objective

We sought to analyze Holter monitor reports of otherwise healthy patients on propranolol for infantile hemangiomas to determine the incidence of sustained arrhythmias and to evaluate the utility of Holter monitoring in the outpatient setting.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed the charts of patients with infantile hemangioma who underwent 24-hour Holter monitoring after initiation or dose escalation of propranolol between 2011 and 2014.

Results

In all, 43 patients aged 1.8 to 36.2 months, with 44 Holter monitor reports, were included in the study. No sustained arrhythmias were revealed. The treatment plan was not altered in any patient based on the Holter monitor report.

Limitations

This was a retrospective study design.

Conclusion

Our study suggests that Holter monitoring may be unnecessary in otherwise healthy patients with infantile hemangioma older than 12 weeks who are treated with propranolol in the outpatient setting.

### Ambulatory monitoring and arrhythmic outcomes in pediatric and adolescent patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy [^114qzsw2]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Results

Patient Demographics

During the 5‐year study period, 235 patients met inclusion criteria. The majority of patients had normal function, with 184 in the LVEF ≥ 55% group, 46 in the LVEF 54% to 35%, and 5 in the LVEF < 35% group (Table 1). Most patients were white, treated with steroids at the time of their study inclusion, and all were male. Patients with LV dysfunction were less‐often treated with deflazacort therapy and more frequently treated with carvedilol, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, and Aldactone (spironolactone). A single patient was treated with digoxin. Patients with LV dysfunction were also significantly older and were more likely to have LV dilation, RV dysfunction, and evidence of LGE.

Table 1
DMD Patient Demographics

Individual Holter

A total of 442 Holters were performed during the study period (Table 2). The majority of the Holters (88%) were performed as a routine screen without symptoms. Atrial ectopy was common, observed in 68% of the Holters. In patients with cardiac dysfunction, frequent premature atrial contractions and nonsustained atrial tachycardia were seen more commonly. No patients had sustained atrial tachycardia.

Table 2
DMD Holter Characteristics (Per Individual Holter)

Ventricular ectopy was also frequent, observed in 45% of the Holters. All ventricular arrhythmia subgroups were more commonly observed in patients with cardiac dysfunction. Notably, 30% of patients in the LVEF < 35% group had nonsustained ventricular tachycardia compared to 0% and 2% in the EF ≥ 55% and EF 35% to 54% groups, respectively. No patients had sustained ventricular tachycardia.

Significant Holter findings were rare (3%) in the full cohort, but were seen more frequently in patients with an LVEF < 35% (40%). Nonsustained atrial tachycardia and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia occurred most frequently in patients with an LVEF < 35%. Of note, there was 1 patient with nonsustained atrial fibrillation and 1 patient with supraventricular tachycardia, both in the normal LVEF group.

Though Holter monitoring rarely led to change in care (4%), change in care occurred at a higher rate in patients with severe cardiac dysfunction (40%), and the only change in care seen in the entire cohort was either initiating or changing the dose of antiarrhythmic medications.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2006). Medium credibility.

ACC/AHA/ESC ventricular arrhythmia management — ambulatory electrocardiography lists Class I indications and modality selection. Ambulatory ECG is indicated when there is a need to clarify the diagnosis by detecting arrhythmias, QT-interval changes, T-wave alternans (TWA), or ST changes, to evaluate risk, or to judge therapy (Level of Evidence: A). Event monitors are indicated when symptoms are sporadic to establish whether or not they are caused by transient arrhythmias (Level of Evidence: B). Implantable recorders are useful in patients with sporadic symptoms suspected to be related to arrhythmias such as syncope when a symptom-rhythm correlation cannot be established by conventional diagnostic techniques (Level of Evidence: B). A 24- to 48-h continuous Holter recording is appropriate whenever the arrhythmia is known or suspected to occur at least once a day, whereas for sporadic episodes producing palpitations, dizziness, or syncope, conventional event monitors are more appropriate because they can record over extended periods of time.

### Diagnostic yield, outcomes, and resource utilization with different ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring strategies [^114eKPWq]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Accurate diagnosis of arrhythmias is improved with longer monitoring duration but can risk delayed diagnosis. We compared diagnostic yield, outcomes, and resource utilization by arrhythmia monitoring strategy in 330 matched adults (mean age 64 years, 40% women, and 30% non-White) without previously documented atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter (AF/AFL) who received ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring by 14-day Zio XT (patch-based continuous monitor), 24-hour Holter, or 30-day event monitor (external loop recorder) between October 2011 and May 2014. Patients were matched by age, gender, site, likelihood of receiving Zio XT patch, and indication for monitoring, and subsequently followed for monitoring results, management changes, clinical outcomes, and resource utilization. AF/AFL ≥ 30 seconds was noted in 6% receiving Zio XT versus 0% by Holter (p = 0.04) and 3% by event monitor (p = 0.07). Nonsustained ventricular tachycardia was noted in 24% for Zio XT patch versus 8% (p < 0.001) for Holter and 4% (p < 0.001) for event monitor. No significant differences between monitoring strategies in outcomes or resource utilization were observed. Prolonged monitoring with 14-day Zio XT patch or 30-day event monitor was superior to 24-hour Holter in detecting new AF/AFL but not different from each other. Documented nonsustained ventricular tachycardia was more frequent with Zio XT than 24-hour Holter and 30-day event monitor without apparent increased risk of adverse outcomes or excess utilization. In conclusion, additional efforts are needed to further personalize electrocardiographic monitoring strategies that optimize clinical management and outcomes.

Electrocardiographic monitoring after acute ischemic stroke — The effectiveness of prolonged cardiac monitoring during hospitalization after acute ischemic stroke (AIS) to guide treatment selection for prevention of recurrent stroke is uncertain; trials show higher atrial fibrillation detection without clear reduction in recurrent events, for example CRYSTAL AF reported atrial fibrillation in 30% of 221 with implantable monitors versus 3% of 220 controls (P < 0.001) with transient ischemic attack or ischemic stroke in 9% versus 11% (P = 0.64), and Find-AF Randomised found atrial fibrillation in 14% of 200 with 10-day Holter monitoring versus 5% of 198 with standard care (P = 0.002) with no significant difference in recurrent stroke at 12 months (7.3% versus 5.4%; P = 0.46).

### Holter monitor rhythm parameters in healthy infants, children, and adolescents: defining reference limits with meta-analysis [^117A7Wpr]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Ambulatory electrocardiography is used to evaluate symptoms (eg, palpitations or syncope) that are suggestive of a possible arrhythmia, to screen for an asymptomatic rhythm abnormality in patients with heart disease and to reevaluate the cardiac rhythm after initiation of antiarrhythmic therapy. Ambulatory electrocardiography, also known as Holter monitoring in honor of the originator, Norman Jefferis Holter, has been in clinical use since the 1960s. The day‐to‐day repeatability of atrial and ventricular ectopic complex frequency with 24‐hour Holter monitoring is excellent, with variations of only 4% to 6%. Holter monitoring has a relatively high yield for arrhythmia detection in pediatric patients with congenital heart disease or cardiomyopathy but not in those presenting with palpitations or syncope without an abnormal 12‐lead ECG or echocardiogram. Longer‐term 1‐ to 4‐week transtelephonic intermittent event recorder electrocardiographic monitoring, available since the 1980s, reveals more symptomatic arrhythmias; however, continuous Holter monitoring detects more asymptomatic rhythm abnormalities. Newer 14‐day continuous electrocardiographic monitoring devices, developed in the 2000s, have a higher yield than cardiac event or Holter monitoring for arrhythmia detection. However, when longer‐term ambulatory continuous monitors capture significant rhythm findings, these are first noted during the initial 24 hours in 44% of children and adolescentsand in 82% of young infants. Therefore, in some clinical situations, Holter monitoring followed by event monitoring as needed may be appropriate.

### Real-time ambulatory ECG does not expedite care [^115SiZYD]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Ambulatory ECG (AECG) is a cornerstone of diagnostic testing for cardiac rhythm abnormalities. Historically, Holter monitoring was the mainstay of such studies, with results provided only after the study was completed, downloaded, and reviewed in entirety by a health care professional. More recently, mobile cardiac telemetry and cardiac event monitors have emerged as routine alternatives to Holter monitoring and are distinguished in part by near real‐time alerts to clinicians. Thus, they can provide much more time‐sensitive diagnostics for potentially serious or emergent conditions. Prior data have shown that mobile cardiac telemetry devices have higher diagnostic yield and more frequent initiation of antiarrhythmic drugs. However, mobile cardiac telemetry can also have a negative impact on health care resources that are required to receive, interpret, and act upon the identified actionable arrhythmias. Whether such tests translate into more timely interventions of these actionable arrhythmias for broader cohorts of patients undergoing rhythm monitoring is unclear.

The objective of the current study is to understand the relative benefit, if any, of AECG studies with "real‐time" alerts compared with traditional Holter studies, in terms of time to intervention across a broad, tertiary care population. We hypothesize real‐time monitoring will lead to earlier detection of arrythmias and earlier interventions. Specifically, we hypothesize that patients undergoing real‐time AECG studies will have earlier interventions, such as cardiac device procedures, catheter ablation procedures, emergency department visits or hospitalization, and new initiation of oral anticoagulation.

Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Hypertension, because of its high prevalence, provides the highest attributable risk for the development of AF (Huxley 2011).76

mHealth strategies for hypertension comprise a continuum of solutions, used by consumers or health care providers, and include wireless diagnostic and clinical decision support (CDS) tools, aiming to monitor health status and improve health outcomes. BP telemonitoring is one of the most commonly used strategies and includes remote data transmission of BP and clinical information from patients in their home or from a community setting to a central service, where they are reviewed by a managing physician for treatment adjustments. Several clinical trials have shown that BP telemonitoring might be more effective than usual care in achieving target BP (Bosworth 2011, Kim 2015, McManus 2010). – A meta-analysis showed that, compared with usual care, BP telemonitoring improved office systolic BP and diastolic BP by 3.99 mm Hg ([95% CI, 5.06–2.93] P < 0.001) and 1.99 mm Hg ([95% CI, −2.60 to −1.39] P < 0.001), respectively (Duan 2017).BP telemonitoring nested in a more complex intervention, including additional support, as face-to-face counseling, telecounseling, education, behavioral management, medication management, and adherence contracts, led to additional and more sustainable benefit (Duan 2017, Tucker 2017). mHealth has the potential to promote patient self-management, as a complement to the doctor's intervention, and encourage greater participation in medical decision-making. Indeed, the TASMINH4 (Telemonitoring and/or Self-Monitoring of Blood Pressure in Hypertension) unblinded, randomized controlled trial showed that patients who used self-monitoring of BP to titrate antihypertensives, with or without telemonitoring, achieved better BP control than those assigned to usual care (McManus 2018). The self-monitoring group that used telemonitoring achieved lower BP quicker than the self-monitoring group not receiving telemonitoring support, but readings were not significantly different at 1 year of follow-up. Cost-effectiveness analysis suggests that self-monitoring in this context is cost-effective by the NICE (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence) criteria, that is, costing well under £20 000 per quality-adjusted life year (Monahan 2019).

### The cox-maze III procedure success rate: comparison by electrocardiogram, 24-hour holter monitoring and long-term monitoring [^115J1R1b]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Background

The detection of atrial arrhythmia recurrence is more accurate when using long-term (5 days to 3 weeks) continuous monitoring devices. In this study, we focus on the comparison of the recurrence of atrial arrhythmias in patients after the Cox-Maze III procedure obtained by three modalities: electrocardiography (ECG), 24-hour Holter monitoring, and long-term monitoring (LTM).

Methods

Patients with follow-up longer than 6 months who reported sinus rhythm while not taking antiarrhythmic drugs were eligible. Atrial arrhythmias longer than 30 s were considered a recurrence. The ECG, 24-hour Holter monitoring, and LTM (5 days) reports were ascertained and compared at the same time.

Results

Patients (n = 291) underwent the full Cox-Maze III procedure, with 194 eligible for the study and 76 agreeing to participate. The average time to monitoring after surgery was 9.8 (± 7.7) months. The ECGs determined 96% of patients in sinus rhythm, Holter monitoring determined 91% in sinus rhythm, and LTM indicated 84% in sinus rhythm. Comparing ECG results and LTM results revealed that 9 patients (12%) had a significant rhythm change. Holter monitoring did not capture all the patients having events lasting longer than 1 hour. No additional information was captured by the use of LTM in patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.

Conclusions

This study reconfirmed that ECG overestimated the success rate after the Cox-Maze III operation by 12% compared with LTM. These changes may carry clinical significance when determining the success of the Cox-Maze III procedure and determining the medical management, including antiarrhythmic and anticoagulation therapy, of the patients who were found to have significant events.

### Holter-electrocardiogram-monitoring in patients with acute ischaemic stroke (find-AF): an open-label randomised controlled trial [^113vVmWg]. The Lancet: Neurology (2017). Medium credibility.

Background

Atrial fibrillation is a major risk factor for recurrent ischaemic stroke, but often remains undiagnosed in patients who have had an acute ischaemic stroke. Enhanced and prolonged Holter-electrocardiogram-monitoring might increase detection of atrial fibrillation. We therefore investigated whether enhanced and prolonged rhythm monitoring was better for detection of atrial fibrillation than standard care procedures in patients with acute ischaemic stroke.

Methods

Find-AF randomised is an open-label randomised study done at four centres in Germany. We recruited patients with acute ischaemic stroke (symptoms for 7 days or less) aged 60 years or older presenting with sinus rhythm and without history of atrial fibrillation. Patients were included irrespective of the suspected cause of stroke, unless they had a severe ipsilateral carotid or intracranial artery stenosis, which were the exclusion criteria. We used a computer-generated allocation sequence to randomly assign patients in a 1:1 ratio with permuted block sizes of 2, 4, 6, and 8, stratified by centre, to enhanced and prolonged monitoring (ie, 10-day Holter-electrocardiogram [ECG]-monitoring at baseline, and at 3 months and 6 months of follow-up) or standard care procedures (ie, at least 24 h of rhythm monitoring). Participants and study physicians were not masked to group assignment, but the expert committees that adjudicated endpoints were. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter (30 sec or longer) within 6 months after randomisation and before stroke recurrence. Because Holter ECG is a widely used procedure and not known to harm patients, we chose not to assess safety in detail. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01855035.

Findings

Between May 8, 2013, and Aug 31, 2014, we recruited 398 patients. 200 patients were randomly assigned to the enhanced and prolonged monitoring group and 198 to the standard care group. After 6 months, we detected atrial fibrillation in 14% of 200 patients in the enhanced and prolonged monitoring group (27 patients) versus 5% in the control group (nine of 198 patients, absolute difference 9·0%; 95% CI 3·4–14·5, p = 0·002; number needed to screen 11).

Interpretation

Enhanced and prolonged monitoring initiated early in patients with acute ischaemic stroke aged 60 years or older was better than standard care for the detection of atrial fibrillation. These findings support the consideration of all patients aged 60 years or older with stroke for prolonged monitoring if the detection of atrial fibrillation would result in a change in medical management (eg, initiation of anticoagulation).

Electrocardiogram monitoring and exercise testing — Prolonged or frequent monitoring may be necessary to reveal episodes of asymptomatic AF that may cause cryptogenic stroke; ambulatory ECG (e.g. Holter) monitoring is also useful to judge the adequacy of rate control and may guide drug dosage for rate control or rhythm management. Exercise testing should be performed if myocardial ischemia is suspected and prior to initiating type IC antiarrhythmic drug therapy, and another reason for exercise testing is to study the adequacy of rate control across a full spectrum of activity in patients with persistent or permanent AF.

### 2017 ISHNE-HRS expert consensus statement on ambulatory ECG and external cardiac monitoring / telemetry [^115jDghq]. Heart Rhythm (2017). Low credibility.

Ambulatory ECG (AECG) is very commonly employed in a variety of clinical contexts to detect cardiac arrhythmias and/or arrhythmia patterns which are not readily obtained from the standard ECG. Accurate and timely characterization of arrhythmias is crucial to direct therapies that can have an important impact on diagnosis, prognosis or patient symptom status. The rhythm information derived from the large variety of AECG recording systems can often lead to appropriate and patient-specific medical and interventional management. The details in this document provide background and framework from which to apply AECG techniques in clinical practice, as well as clinical research.

2023 ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS atrial fibrillation guideline — Arrhythmia-induced cardiomyopathy recovery and monitoring: In an observational study of 24 patients with AF-induced cardiomyopathy and New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III/IV heart failure (HF), the median time from arrhythmia onset to cardiomyopathy and HF was 4.2 years, and aggressive rate/rhythm control produced significant left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) recovery in all patients within 6 months; 5 of 24 had recurrent atrial fibrillation (AF) with rapid LVEF decline within 6 months. In an observational cohort of 69 patients with AF and LVEF < 40% undergoing catheter ablation, those maintaining sinus rhythm (65%) had complete recovery and maintained normal LVEF over 28 ± 11 months of follow-up compared with those with recurrent AF/AT. Long-term surveillance to detect recurrent AF can use wearable devices, smart watches, random monitoring (Holter, event, mobile telemetry), and implantable loop recorders.

### Methodologies to characterize the QT / corrected QT interval in the presence of drug-induced heart rate changes or other autonomic effects [^1139yBNt]. American Heart Journal (2012). Low credibility.

This White Paper, written collaboratively by members of the Cardiac Safety Research Consortium from academia, industry, and regulatory agencies, discusses different methods to characterize the QT effects for drugs that have a substantial direct or indirect effect on heart rate. Descriptions and applications are provided for individualized QT-R-R correction, Holter bin, dynamic QT beat-to-beat, pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modeling, and QT assessment at constant heart rate. Most of these techniques are optimally performed using continuous electrocardiogram data obtained in clinical studies designed to characterize a drug's effect on the QT interval. An important study design element is the collection of drug-free data over a range of heart rates seen on treatment. The range of heart rates is increased at baseline by using ambulatory electrocardiogram recordings in addition to those collected under semisupine, resting conditions. Discussions in this study summarize areas of emerging consensus and other areas in which consensus remains elusive and provide suggestions for additional research to further increase our knowledge and understanding of this topic.

### Effectiveness of structured, hospital-based, nurse-led atrial fibrillation clinics: a comparison between a real-world population and a clinical trial population [^112NPtVp]. Open Heart (2016). Low credibility.

Patient care plans

The real-world patients, who were referred by a cardiologist on a hospital ward or in an outpatient clinic, were offered the components of a care package in the outpatient, nurse-led AF clinic. Prior to the first contact in the nurse-led AF clinic, the patients underwent laboratory testing and, optionally, Holter monitoring and 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. The AF care consisted of 1–4 planned, individual visits during the first year, with 3–4-month intervals between visits. The number of visits was determined by knowledge of AF, symptoms, need for adjustment of medication and treatment strategy. If changes in a patient's treatment were required, then the patient was seen at additional visits or was followed up by telephone. For questions between visits, patients could telephone the AF nurse specialist. When starting of Class 1C Antiarrhythmic drugs or elective cardioversion was needed, the AF nurse specialist planned the procedure with the department of cardiology and informed the patient. The AF specialist nurses were supervised by a cardiologist, and any modification of therapy, including increases in medication dosages or changes in the treatment strategy, was approved by the cardiologist.

### Quinidine sulfate [^112R7F1u]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

Reduction of frequency of release into atrial fibrillation/flutter

In a patient with a history of frequent symptomatic episodes of atrial fibrillation/flutter, the goal of therapy with quinidine sulfate should be an increase in the average time between episodes. In most patients, the tachyarrhythmia during therapy with quinidine sulfate, and a single recurrence should not be interpreted as therapeutic failure. will recur

Especially in patients with known structural heart disease or other risk factors for toxicity, initiation or dose-adjustment of treatment with quinidine sulfate should generally be performed in a setting where facilities and personnel for monitoring and resuscitation are continuously available. Monitoring should be continued for two or three days after initiation of the regimen on which the patient will be discharged.

Therapy with quinidine sulfate should be begun with 200 mg (equivalent to 166 mg of quinidine base) every six hours. If this regimen is well tolerated, if the serum quinidine level is still well within the laboratory's therapeutic range, and if the average time between arrhythmic episodes has not been satisfactorily increased, then the dose may be cautiously raised. The total daily dosage should be reduced if the QRS complex widens to 130% of its pre-treatment duration; the QT interval widens to 130% of its pre-treatment duration and is then longer than 500 ms; P waves disappear; or the patient develops significant tachycardia, symptomatic bradycardia, or hypotension.C

Suppression of ventricular arrhythmias

Dosing regimens for the use of quinidine sulfate in suppressing life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias have not been adequately studied. Described regimens have generally been similar to the regimen described just above for the prophylaxis of symptomatic atrial fibrillation/flutter. Where possible, therapy should be guided by the results of programmed electrical stimulation and/or Holter monitoring with exercise.

### Ambulatory monitoring and arrhythmic outcomes in pediatric and adolescent patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy [^115SJuga]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Methods

Patient Demographics

This was a single‐center retrospective analysis of patients with a diagnosis of DMD who received a Holter monitor from 2010 to 2014. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (IRB#2014‐4394). Given that the study was retrospective and there was minimal risk to the participants, informed consent was waived by the Institutional Review Board. Patients for this study were identified from the Holter database. Patients were included in the analysis if there was either an echocardiogram or CMR with measured left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) performed within 2 years of the Holter study. Patient demographics, cardiac imaging (including echocardiogram and CMR) and electrophysiologic data were obtained from the patient's medical record. Patient age at time of Holter, sex, race, use of cardiovascular medications, history of cardiac arrhythmia, and placement of pacemaker or implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) were reviewed. Outcome data including initiation or change in antiarrhythmic medication, death, aborted sudden death, and cardiac transplantation were reviewed.

Holter Monitoring

The decision to perform a Holter monitor was determined by each patient's cardiomyopathy physician. Holter monitors were 2‐lead monitors (modified V1 and V5) and placed routinely for 24 hours. Patient age and Holter indication including asymptomatic screening, symptomatic screening, or follow‐up of a clinical finding were analyzed.

Holter data evaluated included the following: heart rate, atrial ectopy, ventricular ectopy, supraventricular tachycardia, atrioventricular block, symptoms, and whether specific symptoms correlated with a rhythm disturbance. Atrial and ventricular ectopy were subclassified to rare/occasional (< 720 ectopic beats over 24 hours), frequent (> 720 ectopic beats over 24 hours), couplets/triplets (2–3 beats in a row), nonsustained tachycardia (4–30 beats in a row), and sustained tachycardia (> 30 beats in a row). 18, 19 Significant Holter findings included the following: nonsustained atrial tachycardia, sustained atrial tachycardia, nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, sustained ventricular tachycardia, nonsustained atrial flutter/fibrillation, sustained atrial flutter/fibrillation, and a new finding of conduction system disease.

Holter‐based arrhythmia burden was analyzed (1) by each individual Holter as a separate event and (2) by individual patient with cumulative data from one or more Holter studies.
