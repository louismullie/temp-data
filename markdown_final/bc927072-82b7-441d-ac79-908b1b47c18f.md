## Question

C diff diarrhea can I give imodium

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether Imodium (loperamide) can be given for diarrhea caused by Clostridioides difficile infection, and if there are any situations where its use might be considered safe. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology of C. difficile infection and why antimotility agents might be dangerous. Then, I should verify what the FDA label says about loperamide in this setting. Next, I will review major guidelines (ACG, IDSA/SHEA, ASCRS) for a consensus position. After that, I should examine observational data and case series linking antimotility use to complications. Then, I need to check special populations such as patients with HIV and those with IBD. Finally, I will consider scenarios where cautious, supervised use might be acceptable and outline safer symptomatic alternatives and practical steps if antimotility is absolutely necessary.

> Let me first confirm the pathophysiology and the potential harm of slowing motility in CDI. C. difficile causes toxin-mediated colonic injury, and slowing intestinal transit with loperamide can theoretically trap toxins, increase intraluminal pressure, and precipitate ileus, colonic dilation, or toxic megacolon, particularly in fulminant disease; the FDA label warns against using loperamide when inhibition of peristalsis is to be avoided due to risks of ileus and megacolon, and specifically notes risk in infectious colitis and in immunocompromised hosts, including AIDS, where toxic megacolon has been reported [^115N6Nhg] [^113diku4] [^112kuETi].

> Wait, let me verify the regulatory labeling because that often clarifies the default stance. The FDA label for loperamide explicitly states it should not be used as primary therapy in pseudomembranous colitis associated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, which corresponds to CDI; this is effectively a contraindication for routine use in untreated CDI and aligns with the mechanistic concern about masking symptoms and delaying appropriate therapy [^114jxRY5].

> Next, I should review authoritative guidelines to ensure I'm not missing a niche indication. The American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) 2021 guideline advises that antimotility agents should be avoided in untreated CDI and in fulminant infection, but once appropriate anti-CDI therapy has been initiated, they may be used on an as-needed basis for symptom control; this conditional allowance after treatment starts is the most permissive position among major guidelines and must be balanced with clinical vigilance for deterioration [^111TsenT]. In contrast, IDSA/SHEA and ASCRS guidelines generally discourage antimotility agents in CDI due to the risk of serious complications, particularly when used without concurrent CDI-directed antibiotics, reflecting a more conservative stance [^notfound].

> I will now examine the observational and case-based evidence linking antimotility use to adverse outcomes. A review of 55 CDI patients exposed to antimotility agents showed high rates of complications when given alone without anti-CDI therapy, including colonic dilation and deaths; notably, no complications occurred among patients who received metronidazole or vancomycin concomitantly with the antimotility agent, supporting the guideline caution and the idea that safety may improve if anti-CDI therapy is on board, though the evidence remains low quality and retrospective [^1127vuLB]. Additionally, limited reports suggest routine use of antidiarrheals may be associated with severe outcomes, including death, in inflammatory diarrhea such as CDI, reinforcing the need for restraint [^111Qhugr].

> But wait, what if the patient is immunocompromised or has IBD? Does that change the calculus? I need to check those populations specifically. In patients with HIV or other immunocompromised states, guidelines advise avoiding antimotility agents when inflammatory diarrhea, including CDI, is suspected due to increased risk of complications; this aligns with the FDA's warning about toxic megacolon in AIDS with infectious colitis treated with loperamide, so I should be particularly cautious or avoid loperamide entirely in this group [^113jaAHo] [^115N6Nhg]. For IBD flares with CDI, expert guidance recommends prioritizing CDI treatment with vancomycin and generally avoiding antimotility agents during acute infection; again, if symptom control is essential, it should be after anti-CDI therapy is started and with close monitoring for colonic complications [^111UrSYk] [^111TsenT].

> Hold on, I should verify the exact scenario where loperamide might be considered acceptable. The ACG's "only after anti-CDI therapy is initiated" position implies that use is conditional: the diagnosis should be secured, appropriate antibiotics (vancomycin or fidaxomicin) begun, the patient monitored closely for abdominal distension, pain, ileus, or systemic deterioration, and loperamide stopped immediately if red flags emerge; in fulminant disease or ileus, it should remain avoided altogether, consistent with higher-dose vancomycin and combination regimens used in severe disease [^111TsenT] [^112xY1xn] [^115FJzgA].

> Let me think about safer symptomatic strategies so I don't over-rely on antimotility agents. Supportive care with aggressive oral or IV rehydration and electrolyte replacement is foundational; the loperamide label itself reminds us that antidiarrheals do not replace fluids and electrolytes, and ACG notes that psyllium husk as a bulking agent during recovery may help symptoms without the risks of slowing transit; psyllium is preferred over bile acid binders like cholestyramine, which can bind vancomycin and should not be used concurrently with oral vancomycin [^115N6Nhg] [^111TsenT]. If symptoms are severe enough to contemplate loperamide, the risk–benefit discussion should be explicit and documented, and use should be short-term and lowest effective dose with daily reassessment [^111TsenT].

> I should double-check that I'm not overlooking pediatric or other special dosing constraints. The FDA restricts loperamide use in children under 2 years and notes greater variability and risk of paralytic ileus in very young children; while CDI testing is not routinely advised in children under 2 due to colonization prevalence, the general principle of avoiding antimotility agents in suspected infectious colitis still applies, and any off-label consideration would require specialist oversight [^114WStea] [^112X9sGK].

> Bottom line, I need to ensure the recommendation is precise and reference-aligned. No, you should not give Imodium (loperamide) for C. difficile diarrhea that is untreated or fulminant; antimotility agents should be avoided in those settings due to risks of ileus, toxic megacolon, and delayed appropriate therapy. Only after anti-CDI therapy has been initiated, and with close monitoring for complications, may loperamide be used cautiously on an as-needed basis for symptom control, recognizing that many experts remain conservative and that the evidence is limited; in immunocompromised patients, including those with HIV or IBD, avoidance is the safer default, and supportive care with fluids, electrolytes, and bulking agents is preferred [^111TsenT] [^1127vuLB] [^113jaAHo] [^115N6Nhg].

---

In general, **do not use Imodium (loperamide) for C. difficile diarrhea** because it can mask symptoms, delay diagnosis, and increase the risk of severe complications such as toxic megacolon [^115N6Nhg] [^1127vuLB]. Loperamide is contraindicated in pseudomembranous colitis [^notfound] and should be avoided in untreated or fulminant C. difficile infection (CDI) [^111TsenT]. If anti-CDI therapy has started and symptoms are severe, **use loperamide only with extreme caution and close monitoring** for abdominal distension, pain, or ileus [^115N6Nhg]. Prioritize rehydration, electrolyte correction, and guideline-directed antibiotics (vancomycin or fidaxomicin) [^112WyyUQ]; reserve loperamide only as a last resort for select patients under specialist supervision.

---

## Risks associated with loperamide use in C. difficile diarrhea

Loperamide slows intestinal motility, which can **trap toxins and bacteria**, increasing the risk of severe complications [^115N6Nhg]:

- **Toxic megacolon**: Life-threatening colonic dilation with high morbidity and mortality [^115TRoAC] [^115N6Nhg].
- **Pseudomembranous colitis**: Severe inflammation with mucosal plaques and high risk of perforation [^115TRoAC].
- **Delayed diagnosis and treatment**: Masking symptoms can postpone appropriate therapy and worsen outcomes [^116ipsL5].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines from the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) and Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) **advise against routine loperamide use in CDI**:

- **ACG 2021 guidelines**: Antimotility agents should be avoided in untreated CDI and in fulminant infection; once anti-CDI therapy is initiated, they may be used cautiously on an as-needed basis [^111TsenT].
- **IDSA/SHEA 2017 guidelines**: Antimotility agents are discouraged due to the risk of severe complications [^notfound].

---

## Clinical scenarios where loperamide may be considered

In select cases, **loperamide may be used cautiously** only if all of the following are true:

- **Anti-CDI therapy initiated**: Patient is receiving appropriate therapy (vancomycin or fidaxomicin) [^112WyyUQ].
- **Severe symptoms**: Diarrhea is severe and significantly impacting quality of life [^notfound].
- **Close monitoring**: Patient is under close clinical supervision with vigilant monitoring for complications [^notfound].

Even then, **use the lowest effective dose** for the shortest duration and stop immediately if abdominal distension, pain, or ileus develops [^115N6Nhg].

---

## Alternative management strategies

Preferred strategies that address symptoms while minimizing risk include:

- **Rehydration and electrolyte correction**: Essential to prevent dehydration and electrolyte imbalance [^115N6Nhg] [^117WoiEj].
- **Guideline-directed antibiotics**: Vancomycin or fidaxomicin are first-line therapies for CDI [^112WyyUQ] [^115YTVZK].
- **Probiotics**: May be considered to restore gut flora balance, though evidence is mixed and use should be individualized [^117YBEhf] [^113AhdH4].

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Loperamide use** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Untreated CDI | Contraindicated | Risk of severe complications (toxic megacolon, pseudomembranous colitis) [^111TsenT] [^115N6Nhg] |
| Fulminant CDI | Contraindicated | High risk of complications [^111TsenT] [^1127vuLB] |
| CDI with anti-CDI therapy initiated | Use cautiously, if at all | - Short-term symptomatic relief <br/> - Monitor closely for complications [^111TsenT] [^115N6Nhg] |
| Mild CDI without severe symptoms | Contraindicated | Risk outweighs benefit [^114wRoJm] [^1127vuLB] |

---

Loperamide is **generally contraindicated in C. difficile diarrhea** due to the risk of severe complications [^111TsenT]. Use only in exceptional cases after anti-CDI therapy has started, with close monitoring and at the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration.

Regarding specific circumstances for acute diarrhea, more specifically with respect to patients with HIV (treatment of C. difficile infection), HIV.gov 2025 guidelines recommend to consider administering metronidazole 500 mg PO TID for 10 days as an alternative therapy for nonsevere C. difficile infection if fidaxomicin and vancomycin are not available.

### Continuation of antibiotics is associated with failure of metronidazole for Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea [^115TMAJA]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Metronidazole is first-line therapy for C. difficile-associated diarrhea primarily because of its low cost relative to vancomycin. Currently, it is unknown which patients will fail metronidazole therapy. Our goal was to prospectively evaluate risk factors for metronidazole failure.

Study

Included patients had symptomatic C. difficile-associated diarrhea, either mild or severe. Once enrolled, detailed baseline data were gathered. All interviews were performed daily while the patient was in the hospital for up to 14 days. If discharged prior to 14 days, the patient received a follow-up phone call on day 5 and day 14. Enrolled patients were given a daily stool survey to complete.

Results

We enrolled 27 patients with C. difficile-associated diarrhea. All patients (10 of 10) who had their offending antibiotic(s) discontinued had symptomatic resolution of diarrhea by day 14 of metronidazole treatment. Conversely, 59% (10 of 17) of patients who remained on antibiotics during treatment had symptomatic resolution by day 14 (P = 0.02). The risk ratio for treatment failure was 2.0 (95% confidence interval, 1.29–3.10) in patients who remained on antibiotics. In our treatment group, there would be one additional metronidazole treatment success for every 2.4 patients who discontinued antibiotics.

Conclusion

Patients who remain on antibiotics while undergoing treatment of C. difficile-associated diarrhea have a high likelihood of treatment failure with metronidazole.

### Incidence and predictive biomarkers of Clostridioides difficile infection in hospitalized patients receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics [^112tdhEX]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Clostridioides difficile infections (CDI) are considered the leading cause of infectious healthcare-related diarrhea worldwide and substantial costs have been attributed to its management –. Different medical interventions, including vaccines, probiotics, and agents neutralizing antibiotic residuals in the colon, are being developed to prevent CDI –. These interventions, however, require data from pivotal trials demonstrating clinical efficacy prior to approval by regulatory authorities. Given the relatively low incidence of CDI per individual patient in target populations, trials require large numbers of patients to demonstrate efficacy of a preventive measure. For example, a trial assessing the efficacy of probiotics for the prevention of CDI included 2981 patients, assuming a 12-week incidence of 4%. As the incidence of CDI in the placebo group was only 1.2%, the trial failed to demonstrate efficacy, and would have required a more than threefold larger sample size to reach adequate power for a 50% reduction of CDI. The assumed incidence of the primary outcome is critical for successful execution of a trial and should be assessed in depth. Furthermore, the sample size can be reduced by enrichment of the RCT population with patients at a particularly high risk of CDI. Previous attempts to specify such a population identified advanced age, comorbidities, specific high-risk antibiotics (clindamycin, cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, co-amoxiclav, carbapenems, and trimethoprim/sulfonamides), and previous colonization with C. difficile as potentially important predictive factors –. More recent findings suggest that the composition of the gut microbiota and their associated metabolites play an important role in the pathogenesis of CDI. Therefore, further assessment of these potential biomarkers is warranted.

Here, we demonstrate that the 90-day incidence of CDI and antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) in patients ≥ 50 years of age treated with predefined broad-spectrum antibiotic classes is 1.9% (95% CI: 1.1–3.0) and 14.1% (95% CI: 12.0–16.4), and that carbapenem treatment, toxigenic C. difficile carriage, and the composition and diversity of the gut microbiota predict CDI but not AAD.

### Clostridium difficile colitis [^112kuETi]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Clostridium difficile is the most common cause of infectious diarrhea in hospitalized patients. Its effects are mediated by C difficile toxins A and B. Recent outbreaks of severe colitis have been associated with a new strain of the bacterium that produces large amounts of the toxins. Although oral metronidazole and oral vancomycin can be used to treat C difficile-associated disease, intraluminal vancomycin is preferable for more severe C difficile colitis. Early surgical intervention can improve outcomes with fulminant colitis, although overall mortality remains high.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Opportunistic infection drugs — adverse reactions for acyclovir, adefovir, albendazole, amikacin, and amoxicillin/clavulanate and ampicillin/sulbactam are listed as follows: Acyclovir has crystalluria associated with high doses, dehydration, or pre-existing renal impairment; nephrotoxicity secondary to obstructive urolithiasis, particularly after high dose rapid IV infusion; neurotoxicity (e.g., agitation, confusion, hallucination, seizure, coma) with high doses; especially in patients with renal impairment and/or older patients; and can cause thrombophlebitis at peripheral IV infusion site; nausea; vomiting; and headache. Adefovir causes nausea, asthenia, and nephrotoxicity (especially in patients with underlying renal insufficiency or predisposing comorbidities, or in patients who are currently taking nephrotoxic drugs). Albendazole adverse effects include nausea, vomiting, hepatotoxicity, hypersensitivity reaction, dizziness, headache, reversible alopecia and rarely granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and pancytopenia. Amikacin adverse effects include nephrotoxicity, ototoxicity (both hearing loss and vestibular toxicity are possible), neuromuscular blockade (associated with rapid infusion of large aminoglycoside doses), and pain upon IM injection. Amoxicillin/clavulanate and ampicillin/sulbactam can cause diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea and colitis, hypersensitivity reactions (immediate or delayed reactions, including anaphylaxis), bone marrow suppression, drug fever, and neurotoxicity (seizure) at high doses (especially in patients with renal dysfunction).

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Patients with neutropenia: The safety and efficacy of SIVEXTRO in patients with neutropenia (neutrophil counts < 1000 cells/mm3) have not been adequately evaluated. In an animal model of infection, the antibacterial activity of SIVEXTRO was reduced in the absence of granulocytes. Consider alternative therapies in neutropenic patients. (5.1)
Clostridioides difficile -associated diarrhea: Evaluate if diarrhea occurs. (5.2)

5.1 Patients with Neutropenia

The safety and efficacy of SIVEXTRO in patients with neutropenia (neutrophil counts < 1000 cells/mm3) have not been adequately evaluated. In an animal model of infection, the antibacterial activity of SIVEXTRO was reduced in the absence of granulocytes [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Alternative therapies should be considered when treating patients with neutropenia and ABSSSI.

5.2 Clostridioides difficile -Associated Diarrhea

Clostridioides difficile -associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported for nearly all systemic antibacterial agents including SIVEXTRO, with severity ranging from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents can alter the normal flora of the colon and may permit overgrowth of C. difficile.

C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antibacterial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial drug use. Careful medical history is necessary because CDAD has been reported to occur more than two months after the administration of antibacterial agents.

If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, antibacterial use not directed against C. difficile should be discontinued, if possible. Appropriate measures such as fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.

5.3 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria

Prescribing SIVEXTRO in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.

### Probiotics for the prevention of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea in adults and children [^113dAAUq]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Antibiotics are widely prescribed; however they can cause disturbances in gastrointestinal flora which may lead to reduced resistance to pathogens such as Clostridium difficile (C. difficile). Probiotics are live organisms thought to balance the gastrointestinal flora.

Objectives

The primary objectives were to assess the efficacy and safety of probiotics for preventing Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) or C. difficile infection in adults and children.

Search Methods

On February 21, 2013 we searched PubMed (1966–2013), EMBASE (1966–2013), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 1), CINAHL (1982–2013), AMED (1985–2013), and ISI Web of Science. Additionally, we conducted an extensive grey literature search including contact with industry representatives.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled (placebo, alternative prophylaxis, or no treatment control) trials investigating probiotics (any strain, any dose) for prevention of CDAD, or C. difficile infection were considered for inclusion.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently and in duplicate extracted data and assessed risk of bias using pre-constructed, and piloted, data extraction forms. Any disagreements were resolved by a third adjudicator. For articles published in abstract form only, further information was sought by contacting principal authors. The primary outcome was the incidence of CDAD. Secondary outcomes included the incidence of C. difficile infection, adverse events, antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) and length of hospital stay. Dichotomous outcomes (e.g. incidence of CDAD) were pooled using a random-effects model to calculate the relative risk and corresponding 95% confidence interval (95% CI). Continuous outcomes (e.g. length of hospital) were pooled using a random-effects model to calculate the mean difference and corresponding 95% CI. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to explore the impact of missing data on efficacy and safety outcomes. For the sensitivity analyses, we assumed that the event rate for those participants in the control group who had missing data was the same as the event rate for those participants in the control group who were successfully followed. For the probiotic group we calculated effects using the following assumed ratios of event rates in those with missing data in comparison to those successfully followed: 1.5:1, 2:1, 3:1, and 5:1. To explore possible explanations for heterogeneity, a priori subgroup analysis were conducted on probiotic species, dose, adult versus pediatric population, and risk of bias. The overall quality of the evidence supporting each outcome was assessed using the GRADE criteria.

Main Results

A total of 1871 studies were identified with 31 (4492 participants) meeting eligibility requirements for our review. Overall 11 studies were rated as a high risk of bias due mostly to missing outcome data. A complete case analysis (i.e. participants who completed the study) of those trials investigating CDAD (23 trials, 4213 participants) suggests that probiotics significantly reduce this risk by 64%. The incidence of CDAD was 2.0% in the probiotic group compared to 5.5% in the placebo or no treatment control group (RR 0.36; 95% CI 0.26 to 0.51). Sixteen of 23 trials had missing CDAD data ranging from 5% to 45%. These results proved robust to sensitivity analyses of plausible and worst-plausible assumptions regarding missing outcome data and were similar whether considering trials in adults versus children, lower versus higher doses, different probiotic species, or higher versus lower risk of bias. Our judgment is that the overall evidence warrants moderate confidence in this large relative risk reduction. We downgraded the overall quality of evidence for CDAD to 'moderate' due to imprecision. There were few events (154) and the calculated optimal information size (n = 8218) was more than the total sample size. With respect to the incidence of C. difficile infection, a secondary outcome, pooled complete case results from 13 trials (961 participants) did not show a statistically significant reduction. The incidence of C. difficile infection was 12.6% in the probiotics group compared to 12.7% in the placebo or no treatment control group (RR 0.89; 95% CI 0.64 to 1.24). Adverse events were assessed in 26 studies (3964 participants) and our pooled complete case analysis indicates probiotics reduce the risk of adverse events by 20% (RR 0.80; 95% CI 0.68 to 0.95). In both treatment and control groups the most common adverse events included abdominal cramping, nausea, fever, soft stools, flatulence, and taste disturbance. For the short-term use of probiotics in patients that are not immunocompromised or severely debilitated, we consider the strength of this evidence to be moderate.

Authors' Conclusions

Based on this systematic review and meta-analysis of 23 randomized controlled trials including 4213 patients, moderate quality evidence suggests that probiotics are both safe and effective for preventing Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea.

### Probiotics in the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea and Clostridium difficile infection [^115f9qxD]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Diarrhoea, as a common side effect of antibiotics, increases treatment costs and length of stay in acute healthcare facilities. One potential strategy to prevent this side effect is the concurrent use of probiotic bacteria or yeast. This review discusses the evidence for the efficacy of probiotics in the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea and Clostridium difficile infection; the potential mechanisms by which probiotics may work; their safety; what future research is required; and recommendations for use in clinical practice.

### ACG clinical guidelines: prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of Clostridioides difficile infections [^115FJzgA]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Fulminant Clostridioides difficile infection — oral vancomycin dosing and response: A higher dose of oral vancomycin at 500 mg every 6 hours is recommended by multiple society guidelines, although direct comparison of low-dose (< 500 mg/d) and high-dose (> 500 mg/d) regimens found no significant differences and even profuse diarrhea achieved levels on 125 mg 4 times a day. The authors state it is reasonable to treat with the higher dose for the first 48–72 hours, then, if there is clinical improvement, the dose should be decreased to 125 mg every 6 hours and continued for an additional 10 days; if no response is seen after 48–72 hours on high-dose vancomycin, therapy should be reevaluated and an alternative approach considered.

Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

Rationale for recommendation — The panel states that the balance of benefits and harms "favors adding bezlotoxumab to SOC antibiotics for patients with a CDI episode and at least 1 risk factor for recurrence (recurrent CDI episode within the last 6 months, age ≥ 65 years, immunocompromised host, and severe CDI on presentation)", and notes it "seems more favorable in patients with multiple risk factors for recurrent CDI and especially in patients with a prior CDI in the last 6 months". The certainty of evidence is described as "moderate overall, but very low in subpopulations at high risk of CDI recurrence".

### Antibiotic treatment for Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhoea in adults [^114Sg48u]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) is recognized as a frequent cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea and colitis. This review is an update of a previously published Cochrane review.

Objectives

The aim of this review is to investigate the efficacy and safety of antibiotic therapy for C. difficile-associated diarrhoea (CDAD), or C. difficile infection (CDI), being synonymous terms.

Search Methods

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL and the Cochrane IBD Group Specialized Trials Register from inception to 26 January 2017. We also searched clinicaltrials.gov and clinicaltrialsregister.eu for ongoing trials.

Selection Criteria

Only randomised controlled trials assessing antibiotic treatment for CDI were included in the review.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three authors independently assessed abstracts and full text articles for inclusion and extracted data. The risk of bias was independently rated by two authors. For dichotomous outcomes, we calculated the risk ratio (RR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (95% CI). We pooled data using a fixed-effect model, except where significant heterogeneity was detected, at which time a random-effects model was used. The following outcomes were sought: sustained symptomatic cure (defined as initial symptomatic response and no recurrence of CDI), sustained bacteriologic cure, adverse reactions to the intervention, death and cost.

Main Results

Twenty-two studies (3215 participants) were included. The majority of studies enrolled patients with mild to moderate CDI who could tolerate oral antibiotics. Sixteen of the included studies excluded patients with severe CDI and few patients with severe CDI were included in the other six studies. Twelve different antibiotics were investigated: vancomycin, metronidazole, fusidic acid, nitazoxanide, teicoplanin, rifampin, rifaximin, bacitracin, cadazolid, LFF517, surotomycin and fidaxomicin. Most of the studies were active comparator studies comparing vancomycin with other antibiotics. One small study compared vancomycin to placebo. There were no other studies that compared antibiotic treatment to a placebo or a 'no treatment' control group. The risk of bias was rated as high for 17 of 22 included studies. Vancomycin was found to be more effective than metronidazole for achieving symptomatic cure. Seventy-two per cent (318/444) of metronidazole patients achieved symptomatic cure compared to 79% (339/428) of vancomycin patients (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.84 to 0.97; moderate quality evidence). Fidaxomicin was found to be more effective than vancomycin for achieving symptomatic cure. Seventy-one per cent (407/572) of fidaxomicin patients achieved symptomatic cure compared to 61% (361/592) of vancomycin patients (RR 1.17, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.31; moderate quality evidence). Teicoplanin may be more effective than vancomycin for achieving a symptomatic cure. Eightly-seven per cent (48/55) of teicoplanin patients achieved symptomatic cure compared to 73% (40/55) of vancomycin patients (RR 1.21, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.46; very low quality evidence). For other comparisons including the one placebo-controlled study the quality of evidence was low or very low due to imprecision and in many cases high risk of bias because of attrition and lack of blinding. One hundred and forty deaths were reported in the studies, all of which were attributed by study authors to the co-morbidities of the participants that lead to acquiring CDI. Although many other adverse events were reported during therapy, these were attributed to the participants' co-morbidities. The only adverse events directly attributed to study medication were rare nausea and transient elevation of liver enzymes. Recent cost data (July 2016) for a 10 day course of treatment shows that metronidazole 500 mg is the least expensive antibiotic with a cost of USD 13 (Health Warehouse). Vancomycin 125 mg costs USD 1779 (Walgreens for 56 tablets) compared to fidaxomicin 200 mg at USD 3453.83 or more (Optimer Pharmaceuticals) and teicoplanin at approximately USD 83.67 (GBP 71.40, British National Formulary).

Authors' Conclusions

No firm conclusions can be drawn regarding the efficacy of antibiotic treatment in severe CDI as most studies excluded patients with severe disease. The lack of any 'no treatment' control studies does not allow for any conclusions regarding the need for antibiotic treatment in patients with mild CDI beyond withdrawal of the initiating antibiotic. Nonetheless, moderate quality evidence suggests that vancomycin is superior to metronidazole and fidaxomicin is superior to vancomycin. The differences in effectiveness between these antibiotics were not too large and the advantage of metronidazole is its far lower cost compared to the other two antibiotics. The quality of evidence for teicoplanin is very low. Adequately powered studies are needed to determine if teicoplanin performs as well as the other antibiotics. A trial comparing the two cheapest antibiotics, metronidazole and teicoplanin, would be of interest.

Introduction

Clostridioides difficile (previously Clostridium difficile) is the most common pathogen implicated in healthcare-associated infections in the United States (US). Recent data suggest that ~40% of C. difficile infections (CDIs) in the US are community-associated, which often do not have risk factors such as antibiotic exposure or hospitalization commonly associated with healthcare-associated CDI. In Europe, the incidence of CDI is lower than in the US. It is the eighth most frequently reported microorganism in healthcare-associated infections, with increasing incidence in most countries; the majority of cases (76.4%) are healthcare-associated.

CDI classically presents with watery diarrhea (Bristol stool scale 6–7, three or more times a day) and crampy abdominal pain, with or without fever. In rare cases with ileus or a megacolon, diarrhea may not be present. Diagnosis is made by a positive stool test in the presence of typical clinical features. A gamut of tests is available, and the choice of test depends on the institutional protocol and test availability.

Management of CDI has changed significantly in the last few years, with several new treatment options available. In this article, we describe the treatment of primary and recurrent CDI in adults as recommended by recent guidelines along with investigational therapies for CDI.

General principles

The inducing antibiotic(s) or other medications that predispose to CDI should be stopped as soon as possible, is a strong recommendation in the treatment of CDI. Supportive care should include careful fluids and electrolyte management. The use of anti-motility agents for CDI treatment is discouraged. Patients should be placed on contact precautions in all suspected CDI. Hand hygiene with soap and water by healthcare providers, hospital visitors and patients is more potent than alcohol-based hand sanitizers in eliminating C. difficile spores, due to the inherent resistance of C. difficile spores to alcohol. One time use of disposable equipment is recommended to prevent transmission of CDI. Sole use of non-disposable medical equipment in a patient with CDI with thorough cleaning after use is recommended. In the event of a high clinical suspicion for CDI, medical therapy is recommended before laboratory confirmation.

Antimicrobial treatment

The healthy human gut is host to a diverse microbiota which protects it from pathogenic bacteria by competitive exclusion and production of bacteriocins. When this microbial milieu is perturbed ('gut dysbiosis'), the host becomes susceptible to infections. In order to develop CDI, both gut dysbiosis and colonization with C. difficile bacterium are predisposing factors. The ideal therapeutic agent for CDI is one that successfully kills the bacterium while restoring the disrupted gut microbiota.

Several drugs are used to treat CDI, each with its own spectrum of activity, efficacy, and toxicities. Metronidazole is the oldest drug used for CDI treatment, although it is not recommended by the United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for this purpose and is not recommended by the 2017 IDSA/SHEA guideline in most situations. It is a broad-spectrum antibiotic used to treat anaerobic infections. Metronidazole kills the vegetative forms of the Clostridioides bacterium but not the spores. Thus, it terminates the infection, but leaves the patient susceptible to recurrences in the face of persistent or renewed risk factors for CDI. Metronidazole is almost completely absorbed in the small intestine with undetectable levels in the feces of healthy adults. In the presence of diarrhea however, the levels of the drug in feces increase; this is likely due to the decreased transit time and secretion of the drug across an inflamed colonic mucosa. Since it is absorbed from the gut, systemic side effects are of concern when repeated or prolonged courses are used.

Discontinue FACTIVE immediately at the first appearance of a skin rash, jaundice, or any other sign of hypersensitivity and institute supportive measures instituted (See PRECAUTIONS: Information for Patients and ADVERSE REACTIONS).

Clostridium difficile Associated Diarrhea: Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including FACTIVE, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile.

C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents.

If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.

### Loperamide hydrochloride (imodium) [^115N6Nhg]. FDA (2008). Low credibility.

WARNINGS

Fluid and electrolyte depletion often occur in patients who have diarrhea. In such cases, administration of appropriate fluid and electrolytes is very important. The use of IMODIUM® does not preclude the need for appropriate fluid and electrolyte therapy.

In general, IMODIUM should not be used when inhibition of peristalsis is to be avoided due to the possible risk of significant sequelae including ileus, megacolon and toxic megacolon. IMODIUM must be discontinued promptly when constipation, abdominal distention or ileus develop.

Treatment of diarrhea with IMODIUM is only symptomatic. Whenever an underlying etiology can be determined, specific treatment should be given when appropriate (or when indicated).

Patients with AIDS treated with IMODIUM for diarrhea should have therapy stopped at the earliest signs of abdominal distention. There have been isolated reports of toxic megacolon in AIDS patients with infectious colitis from both viral and bacterial pathogens treated with loperamide hydrochloride.

IMODIUM® should be used with special caution in young children because of the greater variability of response in this age group. Dehydration, particularly in younger children, may further influence the variability of response to IMODIUM®.

Observational studies suggest plasma drug concentrations may be decreased with diarrhea or malabsorption; coadministration of quinolones with magnesium- or aluminum-containing antacids or with calcium, zinc, or iron should be avoided because these interfere with drug absorption, and it is prudent to use IV antibiotics in clinically unstable patients (AIII).

INTRODUCTION

As the causative agent of Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI), the bacterium C. difficile is a Gram-positive, anaerobic spore forming pathogen of the gastrointestinal tract. As a toxin-mediated disease, CDI poses a significant burden to patients and healthcare systems globally. CDI causes a wide range of symptoms, ranging from mild self-limiting diarrhoea to life-threatening complications such as pseudomembranous colitis and toxic mega-colon. Antibiotic treatment can fail to fully resolve the primary infection, resulting in the relapse of disease in up to 20% of cases. C. difficile has been listed as an urgent threat by the Centre for Disease Control (CDC, USA) with an estimated 500 000 cases per year and 12 800 deaths with $1B attributable costs in the United States. The economic impact of CDI also represents a significant burden in Europe, with costs to healthcare systems estimated at €3000M per year. Risk factors for the development of primary CDI include age ≥ 65 years, antibiotic use, with increased risk for each extra antibiotic prescribed, and prior hospital admission.

### Clindamycin hydrochloride [^11559kma]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

WARNING

Clostridioides difficile -associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including clindamycin hydrochloride and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon, leading to overgrowth of C. difficile.

Because clindamycin hydrochloride therapy has been associated with severe colitis which may end fatally, it should be reserved for serious infections where less toxic antimicrobial agents are inappropriate, as described in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section. It should not be used in patients with nonbacterial infections such as most upper respiratory tract infections.

C. difficile produces toxins A and B, which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents.

If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.

### Clostridium difficile [^113diku4]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Clostridium difficile is a major cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea and colitis. The incidence of infection with this organism is increasing in hospitals worldwide, consequent to the widespread use of broad-spectrum antibiotics. Pathogenic strains of C. difficile produce two protein exotoxins, toxin A and toxin B, that cause colonic mucosal injury and inflammation. Many patients who are colonized are asymptomatic, and recent evidence indicates that diarrhea and colitis occur in those individuals who lack a protective antitoxin immune response. In patients who do develop symptoms, the spectrum of C. difficile disease ranges from mild diarrhea to fulminant pseudomembranous colitis. Prevention of nosocomial C. difficile infection involves judicious use of antibiotics and multidisciplinary infection control measures to reduce environmental contamination and patient cross-infection. Ultimately, active or passive immunization against C. difficile may be an effective means of controlling the growing problem of nosocomial C. difficile diarrhea and colitis.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

(1 capsule = 2 mg)

Patients should receive appropriate fluid and electrolyte replacement as needed.

Acute Diarrhea

Adults: The recommended initial dose is 4mg (two capsules) followed by 2 mg (one capsule) after each unformed stool. Daily dose should not exceed 16mg (eight capsules). Clinical improvement is usually observed within 48 hours.

Children: In children 2 to 5 years of age (20 kg or less), the non-prescription liquid formulation (IMODIUM® A-D 1 mg/7.5 mL) should be used; for ages 6 to 12, either IMODIUM® Capsules or IMODIUM® A-D Liquid may be used. For children 2 to 12 years of age, the following schedule for capsules or liquid will usually fulfill initial dosage requirements:

Recommended First Day Dosage Schedule

Two to five years: 1 mg t.i.d. (3mg daily dose) (13 to 20 kg)

Six to eight years: 2 mg b.i.d. (4mg daily dose) (20 to 30 kg)

Eight to twelve years: 2mg t.i.d. (6mg daily dose) (greater than 30 kg)

Recommended Subsequent Daily Dosage

Following the first treatment day, it is recommended that subsequent IMODIUM® doses (1 mg/10 kg body weight) be administered only after a loose stool. Total daily dosage should not exceed recommended dosages for the first day.

Chronic Diarrhea

Children: Although IMODIUM® has been studied in a limited number of children with chronic diarrhea; the therapeutic dose for the treatment of chronic diarrhea in a pediatric population has not been established.

Adults: The recommended initial dose is 4 mg (two capsules) followed by 2 mg (one capsule) after each unformed stool until diarrhea is controlled, after which the dosage of IMODIUM® should be reduced to meet individual requirements. When the optimal daily dosage has been established, this amount may then be administered as a single dose or in divided doses.

The average daily maintenance dosage in clinical trials was 4 to 8 mg (two to four capsules). A dosage of 16 mg (eight capsules) was rarely exceeded. If clinical improvement is not observed after treatment with 16 mg per day for at least 10 days, symptoms are unlikely to be controlled by further administration. IMODIUM® administration may be continued if diarrhea cannot be adequately controlled with diet or specific treatment.

Coffin et al. performed an IPD meta-analysis aimed at comparing racecadotril 175 mg b.i.d. and racecadotril 100 mg t.i.d. efficacy in adults with AID. Two RCTs on 456 patients with similar endpoints were included. Racecadotril 175 mg b.i.d. induced a significantly higher reduction of stool number (−2.0 (−3.21, −0.78) p < 0.001) compared with racecadotril 100 mg t.i.d. Moreover, the last diarrheic stool was observed 25% earlier (p < 0.02). Finally, 10% more responders were observed in the group treated with the new formulation, with a Number Needed to Treat of 10.

Guideline overview

C. difficile is a unique disease in that both infectious disease providers and gastroenterologists see and manage these patients. As such, guidelines from both disciplines will be reviewed, compared and contrasted. The goal of this manuscript is to focus on the evolution of the guidelines and changes over the last few years, but it is important from a foundational standpoint to understand the recommendations prior to the modern era to contextualize how they have evolved into what is recommended today. It is best to break these publications into three time frames: 1995–1997, 2009–2013, and 2014 to the present.

### Probiotics for the prevention of Clostridioides difficile-associated diarrhea in adults and children [^115GtW5G]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Antibiotics can disturb gastrointestinal microbiota, which may lead to reduced resistance to pathogens such as Clostridioides difficile. Probiotics are live microbial preparations that, when administered in adequate amounts, may confer a health benefit to the host, and are a potential C difficile infection prevention strategy.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of probiotics for preventing C difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) in adults and children receiving an antibiotic for any reason.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Ovid MEDLINE, and Ovid Embase from 18 March 2017 (search date of the previous version of the review) to 3 March 2025.

Eligibility Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials with a placebo, alternative prophylaxis, or no-treatment control investigating probiotics (any strain or dose) for the prevention of CDAD in adults and children receiving an antibiotic for any reason.

Outcomes

The critical outcome was incidence of CDAD. Important outcomes included detection of C difficile in stool (i.e. colonization in absence of symptoms), adverse events, antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD), and length of hospital stay.

Risk Of Bias

Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias using Cochrane's RoB 1 tool.

Synthesis Methods

We pooled dichotomous outcomes (e.g. incidence of CDAD) using a random-effects complete-case model to calculate the risk ratio (RR) and absolute risk reduction (ARR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (95% CI). We pooled continuous outcomes (e.g. length of hospital stay) using a random-effects model to calculate the mean difference (MD) and corresponding 95% CI. We conducted sensitivity analyses to explore the impact of missing outcome data on benefits and harms outcomes. To investigate heterogeneity, we conducted a priori subgroup analyses on risk of bias, probiotic dose, probiotic species, adults versus children, inpatients versus outpatients, and the event rate in the control group for developing CDAD (low 0% to 2%; moderate 3% to 5%; high > 5%). The certainty of the evidence for each outcome was independently assessed using the GRADE approach.

Included Studies

Eight new studies (n = 4595) met our inclusion criteria, for a total of 47 included studies (n = 15,260). Although we noted a high risk of bias in individual studies for sequence generation or allocation concealment, this did not impact our findings. Around 30% of studies lacked a published protocol or clinical trial registration, and in some cases there were inconsistencies between the reported methods and published results. We noted authors' affiliation with a probiotic company and financial support received from probiotic companies in 28 studies.

Synthesis Of Results

Evidence from 38 trials (13,179 participants) suggests that probiotics may result in a small absolute risk reduction (ARR) of 1.6% (incidence of 1.6% [110/6787] in the probiotic group versus 3.2% [203/6392] in the control group), and a relative risk reduction (RRR) of 50% (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.64; P < 0.001; low-certainty evidence) in incidence of CDAD. Twenty-seven of 38 trials had missing CDAD data, ranging from 2% to 45%. Our complete-case CDAD results proved robust to sensitivity analyses of plausible and worst-plausible assumptions regarding missing outcome data. Pooled results from 16 trials (1302 participants) suggest that probiotics may result in a small absolute reduction in C difficile in stool (i.e. colonization in absence of symptoms) (ARR 2.1%; incidence of 14.9% [101/677] in the probiotic group versus 16.2% [101/625] in the control group; RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.11; P = 0.27; low-certainty evidence). Thirty-seven studies (11,911 participants) reported on adverse events. Our pooled analysis indicates that probiotics probably result in a small ARR of 1.7% (incidence of 10.9% [669/6148] in the probiotic group versus 12.2% [701/5763] in the control group), and an RRR of 14.0% (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.01; P = 0.074; moderate-certainty evidence). The most common adverse events in both the treatment and control groups were abdominal cramping, nausea, fever, soft stools, flatulence, and taste disturbance. Pooled results from 40 studies (13,419 participants) suggest that probiotics may result in a large ARR of 9% (incidence of 23% [1592/6901] in the probiotic group versus 27.4% [1787/6518] in the control group), and an RRR of 33% (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.78; P < 0.001; low-certainty evidence) in incidence of AAD. Only seven trials (6553 participants) investigated length of hospital stay. There is likely little to no difference in length of hospital stay between treatment and control groups (MD -0.07, 95% CI -0.35 to 0.21; P = 0.63; moderate-certainty evidence). We downgraded the certainty of evidence for CDAD and AAD due to the low number of events or publication bias. We observed some variability in CDAD control group event rate (< 2% to > 5%) that may impact the applicability of evidence depending on clinical setting. We downgraded the certainty of evidence for adverse events due to variation between the results of the studies and for hospital stay due to selective reporting.

Authors' Conclusions

The currently available evidence suggests that probiotics may be effective for preventing CDAD, suggesting that for every 65 people taking probiotics, one case of CDAD may be prevented (number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome of 65, 95% CI 48 to 97). There are probably fewer adverse events in the probiotic group. The short-term use of probiotics may have a small absolute benefit, and is likely not associated with adverse effects when used in patient populations receiving systemic antibiotics who are not immunocompromised. Large trials comparing probiotics with placebo in people with a low baseline risk of CDAD are needed.

Funding

There was no source of funding for this update.

Registration

The original review was done in 2013 by Johnston and colleagues, for which the protocol was developed. We followed the methods specified in the 2017 review, while modifying the search strategy and risk of bias assessment for selective reporting for this update.

The use of IMODIUM in children under 2 years is not recommended. There have been rare reports of paralytic ileus associated with abdominal distention. Most of these reports occurred in the setting of acute dysentery, overdose, and with very young children less than two years of age.

Elderly

No formal pharmacokinetic studies were conducted in elderly subjects. However, there were no major differences reported in the drug disposition in elderly patients with diarrhea relative to young patients. No dosage adjustment is required in the elderly.

Renal Impairment

No pharmacokinetic data are available in patients with renal impairment. Since the metabolites and the unchanged drug are mainly excreted in the feces, no dosage adjustment is required for patients with renal impairment (see PRECAUTIONS section).

Hepatic Impairment

Although no pharmacokinetic data are available in patients with hepatic impairment, IMODIUM should be used with caution in such patients because of reduced first pass metabolism. (see Precautions).

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) — clinical presentation and diagnostic testing guidance notes a spectrum "from mild diarrhea to fulminant colitis associated with a systemic inflammatory response that develops in less than 10% of patients", with features including "abdominal pain or distension, severe diarrhea, ileus, dehydration, organ failure, or sepsis". CDI diarrhea is "characterized by otherwise unexplained watery stools 3 or more times a day", and "patients who do not exhibit these kinds of bowel symptoms should not be tested for CDI". For suspected fulminant disease, "patients with a concern for fulminant disease who present with an ileus or megacolon and patients with an unexplained significant leukocytosis may benefit from a C difficile evaluation".

### Probiotics to prevent Clostridium difficile infection in patients receiving antibiotics [^116tn28f]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

In adults and children prescribed antibiotics, is co-administration of a probiotic associated with a lower risk of symptomatic Clostridium difficile infection without an increase in adverse events?

Bottom Line

Moderate-quality evidence suggests that probiotics are associated with a lower risk of C difficile infection and very low-quality evidence suggests that probiotics are associated with fewer adverse events vs placebo or no treatment.

### Evolution of clinical guidelines for antimicrobial management ofinfection [^115xdFfF]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Evolution of Guideline-Based Antimicrobial Recommendations to Treat C. difficile Infection. Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is the most common healthcare-associated infection in the United States (US), imposing a major burden on our healthcare system and affecting approximately 365,000 people annually. The financial burden of managing this infection is significant as well. It is estimated that all-cause direct medical costs for a population aged 18–64 were approximately US$72,000 for those with no recurrence and approximately US$200,000 for those with three or more recurrences. Given these considerations, optimizing therapies with data-driven recommendations by experts in the field can be most beneficial to minimize the burden of this disease on our patients, lessen the frequency of recurrence, and improve overall outcomes. Clinical guideline recommendations are an essential tool guiding treatment as they summarize data for a disease and provide algorithms to manage patients based on data that has been critically validated.

The CDI epidemic essentially began in the mid-1990s and continues to this day. As this epidemic has extended, there have been more reports and studies considering this infection. When searching " C. difficile " in PubMed, there were 68 references in 1995. In 2020, there were 726. With this influx of new studies, there have been surprisingly few well-performed prospective randomized controlled trials comparing treatments head-to-head. As a result, we rely on smaller studies or non-standard designs to guide our treatments for CDI and recurrent disease. This reliance on imperfect studies has led to certain foundational treatments becoming standard without the supporting data that we would typically expect from a clinical guideline that impacts care as significantly as guidelines for the management of CDI. Given these limitations, it is important to understand how the guidelines have changed over time, and, most importantly, what foundational studies have paved the way for the most recent recommendations in order for clinicians to make decisions that are most appropriate for their patients with the best insights to the data that support those decisions.

### A 76-year-old man with recurrent Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea: review of C. difficile infection [^1157fVA3]. JAMA (2009). Excellent credibility.

Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is a common and increasingly severe nosocomial infectious disease. The case of Mr S, a 76-year-old man with multiple recurrences of CDI, illustrates the difficulties in treating recurrent disease and the way it complicates the management of other medical conditions. Risk factors for CDI include antimicrobial use, hospital admission, advancing age, and severe underlying disease. A clinical diagnosis of CDI is usually confirmed by identifying C. difficile toxins in a stool sample. Evidence supports metronidazole, 500 mg every 6 hours for 10 to 14 days, as the treatment of choice for mild to moderately severe CDI. Oral vancomycin, 125 mg every 6 hours for 10 to 14 days, is recommended for severe CDI, for which it is more effective than metronidazole. Recurrent CDI occurs in more than 20% of patients when metronidazole or vancomycin treatment is discontinued. Few studies have evaluated treatment options for recurrent CDI, but a prolonged, tapering, and pulse-dosed regimen of oral vancomycin is commonly used. Careful attention to antimicrobial stewardship and infection control practices is essential to curb this nosocomial, iatrogenic disease.

### Colistimethate sodium (colistimethate) [^116JL4Sx]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

WARNINGS

Maximum daily dose calculated from colistin base activity should not exceed 5 mg/kg/day with normal renal function.

Transient neurological disturbances may occur. These include circumoral paresthesia or numbness, tingling or formication of the extremities, generalized pruritus, vertigo, dizziness, and slurring of speech. For these reasons, patients should be warned not to drive vehicles or use hazardous machinery while on therapy. Reduction of dosage may alleviate symptoms. Therapy need not be discontinued, but such patients should be observed with particular care.

Nephrotoxicity can occur and is probably a dosedependent effect of colistimethate sodium. These manifestations of nephrotoxicity are reversible following discontinuation of the antibiotic.

Overdosage can result in renal insufficiency, muscle weakness, and apnea (see OVERDOSAGE section). See PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions subsection for use concomitantly with other antibiotics and curariform drugs.

Respiratory arrest has been reported following intramuscular administration of colistimethate sodium. Impaired renal function increases the possibility of apnea and neuromuscular blockade following administration of colistimethate sodium. Therefore, it is important to follow recommended dosing guidelines. See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION section for use in renal impairment.

Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including Colistimethate for Injection, USP and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile.

C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents.

If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.

### Strategies to preventinfections in acute-care hospitals: 2022 update [^112X9sGK]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2023). High credibility.

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) testing — utilization strategies emphasize defined criteria, symptom-based testing, and age-specific cautions. "Institutions should establish criteria for CDI test collection, processing, and test interpretation", which is "particularly important when NAATs are used either as a standalone test or multi-step testing algorithm". Testing criteria may include diarrhea presence and other factors, and "evidence-based testing strategies include" the following: "only test patients with clinically significant diarrhea", where "clinically significant diarrhea is defined as 3 or more unexplained and new-onset, unformed stools within the 24-hour period prior to testing". "Testing of those without diarrhea should not be part of routine clinical practice". For patients "without clinically significant diarrhea", testing "should only be pursued" when CDI signs that reduce stool output are present, "such as ileus or toxic megacolon". Before testing patients with nonworsening diarrhea, clinicians "should" consider other etiologies and medications like laxatives; "it may be reasonable to hold laxatives to observe for resolution of diarrhea before sending C. difficile testing". "Repeated testing… should not be performed during the same episode of diarrhea (ie, within 7 days)". Because asymptomatic colonization is common in young children, "testing for CDI is not advised in children aged < 2 years", and testing in "children aged 1–2 years should be deferred" until other causes are excluded. "Most patients who are clinically cured… will continue to have toxigenic C. difficile… which is not an indication for test of cure".

### Clostridium difficile – associated diarrhea [^1176HXDc]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Clostridium difficile infection is responsible for approximately 3 million cases of diarrhea and colitis annually in the United States. The mortality rate is 1 to 2.5 percent. Early diagnosis and prompt aggressive treatment are critical in managing C. difficile-associated diarrhea. Major predisposing factors for symptomatic C. difficile colitis include antibiotic therapy; advanced age; multiple, severe underlying diseases; and a faulty immune response to C. difficile toxins. The most common confirmatory study is an enzyme immunoassay for C. difficile toxins A and B. The test is easy to perform, and results are available in two to four hours. Specificity of the assay is high (93 to 100 percent), but sensitivity ranges from 63 to 99 percent. In severe cases, flexible sigmoidoscopy can provide an immediate diagnosis. Treatment of C. difficile-associated diarrhea includes discontinuation of the precipitating antibiotic (if possible) and the administration of metronidazole or vancomycin. Preventive measures include the judicious use of antibiotics, thorough hand washing between patient contacts, use of precautions when handling an infected patient or items in the patient's immediate environment, proper disinfection of objects, education of staff members, and isolation of the patient.

CDI symptomatic and adjunctive therapies — antimotility agents and bile acid–binding agents: Based on these data, antimotility agents should be avoided in untreated CDI and in patients with fulminant infection; however, once patients have initiated anti-CDI therapy, they can be used safely on an as-needed basis. Cholestyramine or other bile acid–binding agents are sometimes given with anti-CDI therapy, but there is a paucity of evidence to support these claims, and administration together with vancomycin is contraindicated because of drug–drug interactions, specifically the potential to bind antibiotics; therefore, they should not be used as monotherapy or concurrently with anti-CDI therapy. The addition of psyllium husk as a bulking agent may help diarrheal symptoms when given during the recovery phase.

### ACG clinical guidelines: prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of Clostridioides difficile infections [^112WyyUQ]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

ACG Clinical Guidelines — initial and severe/fulminant CDI treatment recommend for an initial nonsevere episode that oral vancomycin 125 mg 4 times daily for 10 d be used (strong recommendation, low quality of evidence) or that oral fidaxomicin 200 mg twice daily for 10 d be used (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence), while oral metronidazole 500 mg 3 times daily for 10 d may be considered in low-risk patients. As initial therapy for severe CDI, we recommend vancomycin 125 mg 4 times a day for 10 d (strong recommendation, low quality of evidence) and we recommend fidaxomicin 200 mg twice daily for 10 d (conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence). Patients with fulminant CDI should receive medical therapy that includes adequate volume resuscitation and treatment with 500 mg of oral vancomycin every 6 hr (strong recommendation, very low quality of evidence) for the first 48–72 hr, and combination therapy with parenteral metronidazole 500 mg every 8 hr can be considered (conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence). For patients with an ileus, the addition of vancomycin enemas (500 mg every 6 hr) may be beneficial (conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence).

### Management of Clostridium difficile infection in inflammatory bowel disease: expert review from the clinical practice updates committee of the AGA institute [^111UrSYk]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

The purpose of this expert review is to synthesize the existing evidence on the management of Clostridium difficile infection in patients with underlying inflammatory bowel disease. The evidence reviewed in this article is a summation of relevant scientific publications, expert opinion statements, and current practice guidelines. This review is a summary of expert opinion in the field without a formal systematic review of evidence. Best Practice Advice 1: Clinicians should test patients who present with a flare of underlying inflammatory bowel disease for Clostridium difficile infection. Best Practice Advice 2: Clinicians should screen for recurrent C difficile infection if diarrhea or other symptoms of colitis persist or return after antibiotic treatment for C difficile infection. Best Practice Advice 3: Clinicians should consider treating C difficile infection in inflammatory bowel disease patients with vancomycin instead of metronidazole. Best Practice Advice 4: Clinicians strongly should consider hospitalization for close monitoring and aggressive management for inflammatory bowel disease patients with C difficile infection who have profuse diarrhea, severe abdominal pain, a markedly increased peripheral blood leukocyte count, or other evidence of sepsis. Best Practice Advice 5: Clinicians may postpone escalation of steroids and other immunosuppression agents during acute C difficile infection until therapy for C difficile infection has been initiated. However, the decision to withhold or continue immunosuppression in inflammatory bowel disease patients with C difficile infection should be individualized because there is insufficient existing robust literature on which to develop firm recommendations. Best Practice Advice 6: Clinicians should offer a referral for fecal microbiota transplantation to inflammatory bowel disease patients with recurrent C difficile infection.

Purpose Of Review

To highlights the key changes in the updated Infectious Diseases Society of America and Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America guidelines with respect to the diagnosis and treatment of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI).

Recent Findings

CDI continues as a major threat to healthcare institutions and as a community-associated infection related primarily to antibiotic exposure. Infectious Diseases Society of America/Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America produced extensive CDI guidelines in 2010; in 2018, updated guidance has been published. The new guidelines include key changes with respect to the treatment and diagnosis of CDI.

Summary

Updated, evidence guidelines allow optimization of the diagnosis of CDI and the use of therapeutic interventions, in particular to reduce the risk of recurrent infection.

### 2017 Infectious Diseases Society of America clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of infectious diarrhea [^111Qhugr]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

Infectious diarrhea — loperamide and antidiarrheal safety — A meta-analysis has shown loperamide reduced diarrhea prevalence at both 24 and 48 hours after onset of treatment and reduced total duration; however, deaths have been reported in 0.54% of children given loperamide, and all events occurred in children < 3 years old. In healthy adults, loperamide has been shown to be effective in reducing diarrhea, largely in travelers and with antimicrobials, and in these studies it was not associated with increased occurrence of adverse events; loperamide significantly reduces stool volume in traveler's diarrhea and in most noncholera watery diarrhea syndromes. Patients should be advised about medications with the potential to increase the risk of complications from diarrhea, particularly antidiarrheal and antimicrobial agents, and limited reports suggest that routine use of medications with anticholinergic properties may lead to increased risk of severe outcomes, including death, from diarrhea caused by C. difficile and Clostridium perfringens.

Clinical Trial Data

The adverse effects reported during clinical investigations of IMODIUM® (loperamide hydrochloride) are difficult to distinguish from symptoms associated with the diarrheal syndrome. Adverse experiences recorded during clinical studies with IMODIUM® were generally of a minor and self-limiting nature. They were more commonly observed during the treatment of chronic diarrhea.

The adverse events reported are summarized irrespective of the causality assessment of the investigators.

1) Adverse events from 4 placebo-controlled studies in patients with acute diarrhea

The adverse events with an incidence of 1.0% or greater, which were reported at least as often in patients on loperamide hydrochloride as on placebo, are presented in the table below.

The adverse events with an incidence of 1.0% or greater, which were more frequently reported in patients on placebo than on loperamide hydrochloride, were: dry mouth, flatulence, abdominal cramp and colic.

2) Adverse events from 20 placebo-controlled studies in patients with chronic diarrhea

The adverse events with an incidence of 1.0% or greater, which were reported at least as often in patients on loperamide hydrochloride as on placebo, are presented below in the table below.

The adverse events with an incidence of 1.0% or greater, which were more frequently reported in patients on placebo than on loperamide hydrochloride were: nausea, vomiting, headache, meteorism, abdominal pain, abdominal cramp and colic.

Clostridioides difficile infection occurs when the bacterium produces toxin that causes diarrhea and inflammation of the colon. These guidelines indicate the preferred approach to the management of adults with C. difficile infection and represent the official practice recommendations of the American College of Gastroenterology. The scientific evidence for these guidelines was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation process. In instances where the evidence was not appropriate for Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation but there was consensus of significant clinical merit, key concept statements were developed using expert consensus. These guidelines are meant to be broadly applicable and should be viewed as the preferred, but not the only, approach to clinical scenarios.

### Treatment of an initial infection with Clostridium difficile in patients with inflammatory bowel disease [^117X7WGq]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Although the incidence of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea in the general population has increased dramatically over the past decade, an even greater rate of infection exists in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Susceptibility in this population is likely inherent to the pathophysiology and treatment of these diseases. C. difficile infection can cause serious complications and death. Consequently, early diagnosis and initiation of effective antibacterial therapy is imperative. This article evaluates treatment recommendations for an initial episode of C. difficile infection in patients with inflammatory bowel disease based on the current guidelines and a Cochrane systematic review.

### Healthcare associated diarrhea, not Clostridioides difficile [^113N85rg]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The aim of this article is to review the epidemiology, cause, diagnostic evaluation, and management of healthcare-associated diarrhea (HCAD) with particular attention to current epidemiology and recent developments in diagnostics.

Recent Findings

Multiplex polymerase chain reaction gastrointestinal panels allow rapid detection of a wide array of potential enteropathogens but the role, yield, and utility of these tests have not been systematically assessed in patients with HCAD. Recent epidemiologic studies reaffirm that HCAD is predominantly a noninfectious condition most often caused by medications or underlying medical conditions, sometimes Clostridioides difficile, and occasionally viruses. Other infections are rare.

Summary

Clinical assessment remains fundamental to the evaluation of HCAD and targeted testing for C. difficile is sufficient in most patients. Multiplex gastrointestinal panels may have a role in immunocompromised patients but more study is needed. Medication-induced diarrhea is common and underappreciated and not limited to antibiotics, laxatives, and enemas.

### Antimotility agents for the treatment of Clostridium difficile diarrhea and colitis [^1127vuLB]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Antimotility agent use for the treatment of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is discouraged. We reviewed the literature and unpublished postmarketing surveillance reports regarding antimotility treatment of CDI. Twenty reports met inclusion criteria, describing 55 patients with CDI who were exposed to antimotility agents. All studies were case reports or series, with the exception of 1 retrospective review. Nineteen patients (35%) improved, with clinical resolution. Nine patients (16%) died, and 27 patients (49%) had unknown outcomes. Seventeen patients (31%) with CDI developed colonic dilation; 5 of these patients with severe CDI died. However, all patients who experienced complications or died were given antimotility agents alone initially, without an appropriate antibiotic. Twenty-three patients who received metronidazole or vancomycin coadministered with the antimotility agent experienced no complications. Evidence supporting the hypothesis that worsened outcomes are associated with antimotility therapy of CDI is lacking. Further study of the role of antimotility agents in providing symptomatic relief and reducing environmental contamination with infectious stool may be warranted.

### Laxative use does not preclude diagnosis or reduce disease severity in clostridiodes difficile infection [^116ipsL5]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

To optimize utility of laboratory testing for Clostridiodes difficile infection (CDI), the 2017 Infectious Diseases Society of America-Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (IDSA-SHEA) clinical practice guidelines recommend excluding patients from stool testing for C. difficile if they have received laxatives within the preceding 48 hours. Sparse data support this recommendation.

Methods

Patients with new-onset diarrhea (≥ 3 bowel movements in any 24-hour period in the 48 hours before stool collection) and a positive stool C. difficile nucleic acid amplification test were enrolled. Laxative use within 48 hours before stool testing, severity of illness (defined by 4 distinct scoring methods), and clinical outcomes were recorded.

Results

209 patients with CDI were studied, 65 of whom had received laxatives. There were no significant differences in the proportion of patients meeting severe CDI criteria by 4 severity scoring methods in patients receiving versus not receiving laxatives (66.2% vs 56.3%, respectively; p = 0.224) by IDSA-SHEA, the primary scoring system. Similar rates of serious outcomes attributable to CDI, including death, intensive care unit admission, and colectomy, were observed in the laxative and no laxative groups.

Conclusions

Our study found similar rates of severe CDI and serious CDI-attributable clinical outcomes in CDI-diagnosed patients who did or did not receive laxatives. Precluding recent laxative users from CDI testing, as proposed by the IDSA-SHEA guideline, carries a potential for harm due to delayed diagnosis and treatment.

### Epidemiology of Clostridium difficile-associated infections [^115bd3Qd]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2001). Low credibility.

Clostridium difficile is responsible for 15–25% of cases of antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) and for virtually all cases of antibiotic-associated pseudomembranous colitis (PMC). This anaerobic bacterium has been identified as the leading cause of nosocomial infectious diarrhea in adults and can be responsible for large outbreaks. Nosocomial C. difficile infection results in an increased length of stay in hospital ranging from 8 to 21 days. Risk factors for C. difficile-associated diarrhea include antimicrobial therapy, older age (> 65 years), antineoplastic chemotherapy and length of hospital stay. Other interventions with high risk associations are enemas, nasogastric tubes, gastrointestinal surgery and antiperistaltic drugs. Prospective studies have shown that nosocomial transmission of C. difficile is frequent but often remains asymptomatic. Patients can be contaminated from environmental surfaces, shared instrumentation, hospital personnel hands and infected roommates. Once an outbreak starts, C. difficile may be spread rapidly throughout the hospital environment where spores may persist for months. Measures that are effective in reducing incidence of C. difficile infections and cross-infection include: (i) an accurate and rapid diagnosis, (ii) appropriate treatment, (iii) implementation of enteric precautions for symptomatic patients, (iv) reinforcement of hand-washing, (v) daily environmental disinfection, and (vi) a restrictive antibiotic policy. C. difficile is a common cause of infectious diarrhea and should be therefore systematically investigated in patients with nosocomial diarrhea.

Background

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is one of the most common healthcare-associated infections in the United States – and leads to an estimated 14,000 to 20,000 deaths in the US each year. The cost of CDI ranges from $3,000 to greater than $24,000 per patient in acute-care hospitals. – CDI is defined as the presence of ≥ 3 unformed stools within 24 hours in addition to laboratory evidence of toxigenic C. difficile in stool. While most cases of hospital-onset diarrhea are thought to be noninfectious, studies have attributed 10%–20% of cases of hospital-onset diarrhea to CDI. –

A common cause of hospital-onset diarrhea is the use of laxatives. As many as 44% of patients tested for CDI received laxatives within 48 hours prior to testing. As tests currently used to detect CDI identify the presence of the pathogen and its ability to produce toxins rather than the true presence of CDI, clinicians must carefully choose when to test for CDI. This includes nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) for C. difficile which do not differentiate between colonization and CDI if testing criteria are not followed. Increases in reported CDI rates in recent years may be associated with widespread use of NAATs, compounded by inappropriate C. difficile testing practices. –

There are limited data examining the association between laxative use and C. difficile testing, though laxative use does not preclude CDI diagnosis. However, C. difficile testing in this population may increase the likelihood of identifying patients with laxative-related diarrhea and asymptomatic C. difficile colonization, leading to misclassification and subsequent unnecessary treatment for CDI. Clinical decision support (CDS) alerts are common interventions to guide appropriate testing including for C. difficile. Previously reported CDS alerts for C. difficile testing have notified clinicians of laxative use within 24, 48, or 72 hours prior to testing.

Our academic medical center implemented a CDS alert called a "Best Practice Advisory" (BPA) to notify clinicians of laxative administration within 24 hours prior to C. difficile testing. We first assessed clinician behavior when interacting with the alert to determine its effectiveness in reducing C. difficile testing among patients receiving laxatives. We then assessed clinician rationale for overriding the alert to proceed with C. difficile testing despite recent laxative administration.

5.3 Clostridioides difficile -associated Diarrhea

Clostridioides difficile -associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including XENLETA, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile.

C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin-producing isolates of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial drug use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents.

If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibacterial drug use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial drug treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.

5.4 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria

Prescribing XENLETA in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Persistent Diarrhea

For those patients being treated for travelers' diarrhea, discontinue XIFAXAN if diarrhea persists more than 24–48 hours or worsens. Advise the patient to seek medical care for fever and/or blood in the stool [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Clostridium difficile- Associated Diarrhea

Clostridium difficile -associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including XIFAXAN, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibiotics alters the normal flora of the colon which may lead to C. difficile. Patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If diarrhea occurs after therapy or does not improve or worsens during therapy, advise patients to contact a physician as soon as possible [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Administration with Food

Inform patients that XIFAXAN may be taken with or without food.

Antibacterial Resistance

Counsel patients that antibacterial drugs including XIFAXAN should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When XIFAXAN is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by XIFAXAN or other antibacterial drugs in the future [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

The evidence base to optimize CDI testing is weak. Testing may be indicated if symptoms persist after stopping therapies to which diarrhea may be otherwise attributed (eg, laxatives), and it is difficult to exclude the possibility of CDI on clinical grounds alone in a patient with new-onset or worsened diarrhea. Historical clinical definitions used to justify testing include > 5 loose stools per day (1974), > 6 loose stools over a period of 36 hours (1983), liquid stools or > 4 bowel movements per day for at least 3 days (1989), and ≥ 3 loose or watery bowel movements in 24 hours (2013).

Antibiotic-associated diarrhea and Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) occur frequently among adults. The pathophysiology of CDI is related to disruption of normal gut flora and risk factors include hospitalization, use of antibiotic therapy, and older age. Clinical manifestations can range from mild disease to toxic megacolon. Diagnosis is challenging and is based on a combination of clinical symptoms and diagnostic tests. Therapy includes cessation of antibiotics, or use of other agents depending on the severity of illness. Many novel agents for the treatment and prevention of CDI show promise and are under investigation.

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) — initial treatment for an initial episode: Oral vancomycin or fidaxomicin is considered first-line treatment for an initial CDI, whereas metronidazole alone is no longer considered appropriate first-line treatment; Grade of recommendation: Strong recommendation based on high-quality evidence, 1A. For nonfulminant CDI, the recommended oral vancomycin dose is 125 mg 4 times a day and the recommended fidaxomicin dose is 200 mg twice a day; a 10-day course of either medication resolves CDI diarrhea in > 90% of patients. Evidence synthesis shows vancomycin was more effective in achieving a cure (79%) than metronidazole (72%); relative risk (RR), 0.90; 95% CI, 0.84–0.97, and metronidazole was inferior to vancomycin in initial cure rate (RR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.84–0.98; P = 0.02) and sustained cure rate (RR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.82–0.96; P = 0.003). Combination therapy with both vancomycin and metronidazole is associated with a higher rate of adverse events compared with monotherapy and is not typically recommended unless patients have severe-complicated or fulminant CDI.

Diarrhea

For acute, excessive cholinergic responses (eg, diarrhea, abdominal cramping, salivation) within 24 hours of SG infusion, we recommend atropine injection (0.5–3 mg, subcutaneous [SQ]), followed by premedication with atropine for subsequent SG infusions (consider building into treatment plan if not already present). For diarrhea, we typically manage with patient education, dietary modification, over-the-counter antidiarrheals (eg, loperamide), and additional supportive measures as indicated. It is also important to rule out possible infectious causes of diarrhea, such as Clostridioides difficile (C. diff); antibiotics can be administered as clinically indicated for infectious cases.

All patients should be advised on diarrhea management before starting SG. Patients should have over-the-counter antidiarrheals available while being treated with SG. Proper up-front education on hydration and use of antidiarrheals is important. This includes counseling on when to stop antidiarrheals if patients have concerns with constipation, which may have been experienced with prior anticancer regimens. Dietary modifications include BRAT diet (eg, bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast), small frequent meals, adequate fluid intake of clear liquids to maintain hydration and electrolytes, and discontinuation of lactose-containing foods and drinks containing alcohol. Use of probiotics can be discussed as an option to consider, though there is limited evidence to support the benefit of probiotics for diarrhea. However, it should be noted that some probiotics (eg, those containing Saccharomyces boulardii) are associated with the rare but potential risk of fungemia in individuals with a central venous catheter or central line.

Clostridium difficile colitis is the most common gastrointestinal infection, exceeding all other gastrointestinal infections combined. There has been a dramatic increase in Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) worldwide during the past decade. Antibiotic therapy is a trigger precipitating antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD), which may lead to CDI. The antibiotic alters the protective, diverse bacteria allowing pathogenic bacteria to cause disease. Probiotics have been effective in reducing AAD and preventing CDI.

### Probiotics for Clostridium difficile diarrhea: putting it into perspective [^116KmEG5]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2007). Low credibility.

Clostridium difficile diarrhea is an expensive, life-threatening infection associated with serious morbidity and mortality, even among previously healthy individuals. Relapses from the infection are common following standard antibiotic treatments, with 3–5% of patients who contract C. difficile diarrhea unable to discontinue vancomycin due to continual relapses. Such patients may have a focal immunodeficiency in which they fail to mount an immune response against C. difficile. For these individuals, antimicrobial therapies are unable to eradicate the microorganism because no antibiotics are capable of killing C. difficile spores. Although they are considered alternative medicine, probiotics have provided a safe and effective means of restoring gastrointestinal flora and alleviating diarrhea, particularly for individuals experiencing multiple relapses.

### Probiotics for the prevention of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea in adults and children [^116K5n6y]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Antibiotics can disturb gastrointestinal microbiota which may lead to reduced resistance to pathogens such as Clostridium difficile (C. difficile). Probiotics are live microbial preparations that, when administered in adequate amounts, may confer a health benefit to the host, and are a potential C. difficile prevention strategy. Recent clinical practice guidelines do not recommend probiotic prophylaxis, even though probiotics have the highest quality evidence among cited prophylactic therapies.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of probiotics for preventing C.difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) in adults and children.

Search Methods

We searched PubMed, EMBASE, CENTRAL, and the Cochrane IBD Group Specialized Register from inception to 21 March 2017. Additionally, we conducted an extensive grey literature search.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled (placebo, alternative prophylaxis, or no treatment control) trials investigating probiotics (any strain, any dose) for prevention of CDAD, or C. difficile infection were considered for inclusion.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors (independently and in duplicate) extracted data and assessed risk of bias. The primary outcome was the incidence of CDAD. Secondary outcomes included detection of C. difficile infection in stool, adverse events, antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) and length of hospital stay. Dichotomous outcomes (e.g. incidence of CDAD) were pooled using a random-effects model to calculate the risk ratio (RR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (95% CI). We calculated the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) where appropriate. Continuous outcomes (e.g. length of hospital stay) were pooled using a random-effects model to calculate the mean difference and corresponding 95% CI. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to explore the impact of missing data on efficacy and safety outcomes. For the sensitivity analyses, we assumed that the event rate for those participants in the control group who had missing data was the same as the event rate for those participants in the control group who were successfully followed. For the probiotic group, we calculated effects using the following assumed ratios of event rates in those with missing data in comparison to those successfully followed: 1.5:1, 2:1, 3:1, and 5:1. To explore possible explanations for heterogeneity, a priori subgroup analyses were conducted on probiotic species, dose, adult versus pediatric population, and risk of bias as well as a post hoc subgroup analysis on baseline risk of CDAD (low 0% to 2%; moderate 3% to 5%; high > 5%). The overall quality of the evidence supporting each outcome was independently assessed using the GRADE criteria.

Main Results

Thirty-nine studies (9955 participants) met the eligibility requirements for our review. Overall, 27 studies were rated as either high or unclear risk of bias. A complete case analysis (i.e. participants who completed the study) among trials investigating CDAD (31 trials, 8672 participants) suggests that probiotics reduce the risk of CDAD by 60%. The incidence of CDAD was 1.5% (70/4525) in the probiotic group compared to 4.0% (164/4147) in the placebo or no treatment control group (RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.52; GRADE = moderate). Twenty-two of 31 trials had missing CDAD data ranging from 2% to 45%. Our complete case CDAD results proved robust to sensitivity analyses of plausible and worst-plausible assumptions regarding missing outcome data and results were similar whether considering subgroups of trials in adults versus children, inpatients versus outpatients, different probiotic species, lower versus higher doses of probiotics, or studies at high versus low risk of bias. However, in a post hoc analysis, we did observe a subgroup effect with respect to baseline risk of developing CDAD. Trials with a baseline CDAD risk of 0% to 2% and 3% to 5% did not show any difference in risk but trials enrolling participants with a baseline risk of > 5% for developing CDAD demonstrated a large 70% risk reduction (interaction P value = 0.01). Among studies with a baseline risk > 5%, the incidence of CDAD in the probiotic group was 3.1% (43/1370) compared to 11.6% (126/1084) in the control group (13 trials, 2454 participants; RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.42; GRADE = moderate). With respect to detection of C. difficile in the stool pooled complete case results from 15 trials (1214 participants) did not show a reduction in infection rates. C. difficile infection was 15.5% (98/633) in the probiotics group compared to 17.0% (99/581) in the placebo or no treatment control group (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.10; GRADE = moderate). Adverse events were assessed in 32 studies (8305 participants) and our pooled complete case analysis indicates probiotics reduce the risk of adverse events by 17% (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.97; GRADE = very low). In both treatment and control groups the most common adverse events included abdominal cramping, nausea, fever, soft stools, flatulence, and taste disturbance.

Authors' Conclusions

Based on this systematic review and meta-analysis of 31 randomized controlled trials including 8672 patients, moderate certainty evidence suggests that probiotics are effective for preventing CDAD (NNTB = 42 patients, 95% CI 32 to 58). Our post hoc subgroup analyses to explore heterogeneity indicated that probiotics are effective among trials with a CDAD baseline risk > 5% (NNTB = 12; moderate certainty evidence), but not among trials with a baseline risk ≤ 5% (low to moderate certainty evidence). Although adverse effects were reported among 32 included trials, there were more adverse events among patients in the control groups. The short-term use of probiotics appears to be safe and effective when used along with antibiotics in patients who are not immunocompromised or severely debilitated. Despite the need for further research, hospitalized patients, particularly those at high risk of CDAD, should be informed of the potential benefits and harms of probiotics.

Key points Clostridioides difficile is a common cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea. It accounts for 15 to 25% of all events of AAD.
- Prevent C. diffinfections by appropriately using antibiotics and implementing infection control recommendations to prevent transmission.
- Use EPA-registered disinfectants in patient-care areas, as appropriate. Background C. diff is a spore-forming, Gram-positive anaerobic bacillus that produces two exotoxins: toxin A and toxin B. Risk factors
- Antibiotic exposure.
- Gastrointestinal surgery or manipulation.
- Long length of stay in healthcare settings.
- A serious underlying illness.
- Immunocompromising conditions.
- Advanced age. Diagnosis Patients with CDI exhibit clinical symptoms and test positive for the C. diff organism or its toxin. Colonization vs infection Colonization with C.

diff is more common than infection. Colonized patients do not have disease caused by C. diff and often exhibit NO clinical symptoms like diarrhea. Colonized patients do test positive for the C. diff organism or its toxin. Treatment and recovery If a patient has had three or more stools in 24 hours:

- Isolate patients with possible C. diffimmediately, even if you only suspect CDI.
- Order a C. difftest if other etiologies of diarrhea such as stool softener or laxative were not used. C. diffinfection. In about 20% of patients, CDI will resolve within two to three days of discontinuing the antibiotic to which the patient was previously exposed. However, CDI should usually be treated with an appropriate course of treatment, including oral vancomycin or fidaxomicin. After treatment, repeat C.

diff testing is not recommended if the patient's symptoms have resolved, as patients often remain colonized. Complications
- Pseudomembranous colitis
- Toxic megacolon
- Perforations of the colon
- Sepsis
- Death.
