## Question

What did this trial show about the efficacy and safety of prefrontal–cerebellar transcranial pulsed current stimulation (tPCS) versus sham in children with autism after 20 sessions?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the trial showed about the efficacy and safety of prefrontal-cerebellar transcranial pulsed current stimulation (tPCS) versus sham in children with autism after 20 sessions. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the study design and whether it can answer the question. Then, I should verify the primary and secondary outcomes and how they were analyzed. Next, I will quantify efficacy results and interpret clinical significance. After that, I need to check safety and tolerability. Finally, I should consider limitations, generalizability, and how this fits within the broader evidence base before stating a cautious conclusion.

> Let me first confirm the study design and internal validity. This was a multicenter, double-blind, sham-controlled randomized clinical trial with 312 children aged 3–14 years with ASD, comparing 20 daily sessions of active tPCS versus sham over 4 weeks, with both groups receiving the same 1-hour standard behavioral therapy after each session; centralized randomization and masked outcome assessors were used, which strengthens causal inference, though I should note there was no formal blinding assessment reported, which is a minor limitation I will revisit later [^e4621037] [^4d1cbe4a].

> I need to verify the intervention parameters precisely. Active tPCS used 0.7 mA, 400 Hz pulsed current with the anode over the right cerebellar hemisphere and the cathode over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (F3), with 10-second ramp-up and ramp-down; sham used the same ramp-up/down but no sustained current, and both groups had identical electrode placement and concomitant therapy, which helps isolate the effect of tPCS itself [^13f453a4] [^4d1cbe4a].

> Next, I should review the primary outcome and analysis. The primary endpoint was change in the Autism Treatment Evaluation Checklist (ATEC) total score from baseline to post-treatment, analyzed by ANCOVA adjusting for baseline; the active group improved by a mean of 7.17 points (10.7% reduction) versus 4.13 points (5.8% reduction) in sham, yielding a between-group difference of −3.50 points (95% CI −5.56 to −1.43; P < .001), with the sociability subdomain driving the effect and other subdomains not showing significant differences, which suggests specificity rather than global improvement [^b1aff5e4] [^f9cc7ffc].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about clinical significance without context. I should double-check the magnitude and benchmarks. The absolute difference of about 3.5 points on ATEC is modest, but exploratory post hoc analyses using a 10% or greater reduction as clinically meaningful showed 54.2% of active participants versus 30.6% of sham met this threshold, and the authors argue that even small between-group effects can be clinically meaningful in ASD given the chronicity and limited options; still, I need to emphasize that this 10% benchmark is exploratory and not a validated responder definition, so I should be cautious in overinterpreting it [^29188596] [^f9cc7ffc].

> I will now examine secondary outcomes. The Autism Behavior Checklist (ABC) total score showed a significantly greater reduction with active tPCS (−6.0 vs −1.6; difference −4.00; 95% CI −5.75 to −2.26; P < .001), with the sensory subdomain contributing notably; the Childhood Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ) also improved more in the active group (−4.2 vs −1.9; difference −2.19; 95% CI −3.20 to −1.19; P < .001), particularly in daytime sleepiness, and importantly, sleep improvement was not correlated with ATEC improvement, suggesting independent mechanisms rather than a mediation effect [^a1b1eb21] [^912c567c].

> Wait, let me verify safety and tolerability because pediatric neurostimulation requires careful scrutiny. No serious adverse events occurred in either group; reported events were limited to mild, transient headache (n = 19) and scalp redness under electrodes (n = 27), all resolving within 30 minutes, with no withdrawals due to adverse effects; this aligns with broader pediatric tES safety literature and supports the tolerability of the 0.7 mA protocol in this age range, though I should acknowledge that long-term neurodevelopmental safety remains uncertain and was not assessed in this study [^29188596] [^a9fd5a00] [^cdb33894].

> But wait, what if the observed effects reflect nonspecific benefits from concomitant therapy rather than tPCS? I need to ensure internal validity is protected. Both groups received identical behavioral therapy after each session, and the double-blind, randomized design with masked assessors reduces confounding; nonetheless, the absence of a formal blinding integrity check and the lack of mechanistic biomarkers (e.g. EEG or neuroimaging) are limitations, and the predominance of very young children (88.5% aged 3–6) and exclusion of common medications may limit generalizability to older children or those on antipsychotics [^4d1cbe4a] [^878c9837].

> Next, I should review how this fits within the broader evidence base. Prior pediatric tDCS work in ASD is sparse, heterogeneous, and often uncontrolled, so this large, sham-controlled RCT meaningfully advances the field; however, replication and longer-term follow-up are needed, and the mechanism by which 400 Hz tPCS with this montage improves social functioning remains speculative, with authors proposing inhibition of left DLPFC hyperexcitability and enhancement of cerebellar–prefrontal connectivity, which are plausible but not directly tested in this trial [^d4d89b39] [^912c567c].

> Let me reconsider the practical implications before concluding. The protocol is feasible in outpatient settings, uses a low current intensity with a favorable safety profile, and produced statistically significant and potentially clinically meaningful improvements in social functioning and sleep over 4 weeks; however, durability beyond the immediate post-treatment window is unknown, and families should be counseled that this remains investigational pending replication and regulatory consideration, with continued reliance on evidence-based behavioral interventions as standard of care [^e4621037] [^9941c8b0].

> In summary, after 20 sessions of prefrontal-cerebellar tPCS, children with ASD showed a modest but statistically significant improvement in social functioning versus sham, with additional benefits in sensory-related behaviors and sleep, and no serious adverse events; the effect size is small and the clinical relevance will depend on replication, longer-term outcomes, and broader generalizability, so I should present this as promising but preliminary evidence rather than a definitive treatment recommendation [^e4621037] [^ba74d770].

The trial showed that **prefrontal-cerebellar tPCS (0.7 mA, 20 minutes, 20 sessions over 4 weeks)** significantly improved social functioning and sleep in children with autism compared to sham, with a **mean ATEC reduction of 7.17 vs 4.13 points** (difference −3.50; 95% CI −5.56 to −1.43; P < .001) and a **CSHQ reduction of 4.2 vs 1.9 points** (difference −2.19; 95% CI −3.20 to −1.19; P < .001). No serious adverse events occurred, and only mild, transient scalp redness or headache were reported, indicating **good tolerability**. These results suggest tPCS is a safe, feasible, and potentially effective adjunct to standard therapy, though larger, longer-term trials are needed to confirm durability and generalizability [^e4621037] [^ba74d770].

Importance

Transcranial pulsed current stimulation (tPCS) may improve social functioning and sleep disorders in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Prior trials have been limited by small sample sizes, single-center designs, and often a lack of sham controls.

Objective

To examine the safety and efficacy of tPCS in improving social functioning and sleep disorders in children with ASD.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This multicenter, double-blind, 2-armed, sham-controlled randomized clinical trial, conducted from May 1, 2022, through November 30, 2023, assessed children aged 3 to 14 years with ASD at 8 medical centers in China.

Interventions

Participants underwent daily 20-minute sessions of active tPCS (0.7 mA) or sham tPCS (brief 0.7 mA ramp-up and ramp-down) for 20 sessions over 4 weeks with anode over the right cerebellar hemisphere and cathode over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (12.56-cm²-circular, 4-cm-diameter circular electrodes). Each day after tPCS, all participants received 1 hour of standard therapy.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Social functioning was assessed using the Autism Treatment Evaluation Checklist as the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes included the Autism Behavior Checklist and the Childhood Sleep Habits Questionnaire.

Results

A total of 312 participants (155 in the active group and 157 in the sham group; 248 [79.5%] boys; mean [SD] age, 5.1 [1.6] years; 276 [88.5%] aged 3–6 years and 36 [11.5%] aged 7–14 years) completed the trial. After 20 sessions, the mean Autism Treatment Evaluation Checklist total score improved by 4.13 points (5.8%) in the sham tPCS group and 7.17 points (10.7%) in the active tPCS group. Analysis of covariance showed significantly greater improvement in the active tPCS group (difference, -3.50; 95% CI, -5.56 to -1.43; P < .001). Both treatments were well tolerated.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this randomized clinical trial of prefrontal-cerebellar tPCS in children aged 3 to 14 years with ASD, 20 sessions over 4 weeks improved social functioning and sleep. These findings suggest that tPCS may serve as a viable nonpharmacologic alternative for ASD.

Conclusions

In this randomized clinical trial of prefrontal-cerebellar tPCS in children aged 3 to 14 years with ASD, a 20-session, 1-month intervention was demonstrated to be safe and resulted in greater improvement of social functioning and sleep compared with sham stimulation. More than twice as many participants in the active tPCS group than in the sham group achieved meaningful clinical effects. Future phase 4 trials exploring effectiveness in the community setting are warranted.

The study tPCS for Autism was published by Zhenhuan Liu and colleagues in 2025 in the journal JAMA Netw Open. This study is related to the following diseases: Autism spectrum disorder. In the tPCS for Autism study, the trial question was: what is the effect of prefrontal-cerebellar transcranial pulsed current stimulation in children with autism spectrum disorder? In the tPCS for Autism study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the tPCS for Autism study, the population was: 312 patients (64 female, 248 male). The inclusion criteria were children, aged 3–14 years, with autism spectrum disorder. The key exclusion criteria were epilepsy; craniotomy; implanted devices; severe psychiatric conditions; active scalp infection; obstructive sleep apnea; active use of benzodiazepine, risperidone, or haloperidol; prior noninvasive brain stimulation. In the tPCS for Autism study, the interventions were: n = 155 transcranial pulsed current stimulation (20 sessions of transcranial pulsed current stimulation over 4 weeks, 20 min/day, electrodes over right cerebellar and left prefrontal cortex) n = 157 sham stimulation (20 sessions of sham stimulation over 4 weeks, 20 min/day, electrodes over right cerebellar and left prefrontal cortex). In the tPCS for Autism study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in mean reduction in Autism Treatment Evaluation Checklist total score (7.17 points vs. 4.13 points; MD 3.5, 95% CI 1.43 to 5.56). In the tPCS for Autism study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in mean reduction in Autism Behavior Checklist total score (6 points vs. 1.6 points; MD 4, 95% CI 2.26 to 5.75) Significant increase in mean reduction in Childhood Sleep Habits Questionnaire total score (4.2 points vs. 1.9 points; MD 2.19, 95% CI 1.19 to 3.2). In the tPCS for Autism study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in adverse events. In the tPCS for Autism study, the conclusion was: in children, aged 3–14 years, with autism spectrum disorder, transcranial pulsed current stimulation was superior to sham stimulation with respect to mean reduction in Autism Treatment Evaluation Checklist total score.

tPCS

All participants underwent 20 daily sessions of active tPCS or sham tPCS on consecutive weekdays over 4 weeks, performed by therapists blinded to group allocation. We used a transcranial pulsed current stimulator (model YQ-D1111, YIQI Biotechnology Ltd) for 400-Hz tPCS. Before treatment, a pair of 12.56-cm²-circular silver-fiber cotton electrodes were presoaked in 0.9% sodium chloride solution and positioned on the participants' scalps using a fitted head strap. The cathode electrode was placed over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex at the F3 position (electroencephalography 10–20 international system) located using the Beam-F3 methodto suppress neural hyperexcitability. The anode electrode was positioned over the right cerebellar hemisphere, 1 cm below and 4 cm to the right of the inion to enhance frontal-posterior functional connectivity, identified in research as deficient in individuals with ASDand correlated with symptom severity. Each stimulation session lasted 20 minutes. In the active tPCS group, there was a 10-second ramp-up to 0.7 mA, maintained throughout, and a 10-second ramp-down at the end. The sham tPCS group experienced a 10-second ramp-up to 0.7 mA followed by a 10-second ramp-down to 0 mA for the remainder of the session. We used tESPlan, version 4.0 (Neurophet Inc) to construct an individualized 3-dimensional head model of a 6-year-old child based on T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging to estimate the tPCS-induced electric field distribution, which was approximately 0.15 V/m beneath the cathode (F3) and 0.20 V/m beneath the anode (right cerebellar) (eFigure 1 in Supplement 3).

Concomitant Therapy

Immediately after tPCS, participants in both groups were given a 1-hour behavioral therapy administered by blinded occupational therapists. This therapy included applied behavior analysis therapy, structured education, play-based therapy, and speech therapy, rotated for each participant such that each therapy was administered 5 times during the 20-session treatment course. These therapies constitute routine clinical care for ASD in China, with modest efficacy evidenced in prior studies. The therapies were included to provide a consistent foundation for all study participants.

We hypothesized that prefrontal-cerebellar tPCS, combined with standard therapy, would enhance social functioning in children aged 3 to 14 years with ASD. As a secondary outcome measure, we proposed that tPCS would improve sleep dysfunctions in ASD, supported by evidence linking the prefrontal and cerebellar regions to sleep regulation, and previous studies, showing improved sleep outcomes using similar montages.

Safety Monitoring

The safety of both the active tPCS and sham tPCS interventions were monitored throughout the 20 sessions by experienced clinical staff in all centers. Urine testing was performed before and after the 20 sessions to assess for unintended metabolic changes. Participants were instructed to report other adverse events experienced during or after treatment that were not included in the list of serious adverse events.

Outcome Measures

The primary outcome measure was the Autism Treatment Evaluation Checklist (ATEC), a questionnaire that includes 77 items divided into 4 subscales, including speech, language, and communication; sociability; sensory and cognitive awareness; and health, physical condition, and behavior, yielding a maximum total score of 179, with higher scores indicating more severe symptoms. The secondary outcome measures were the Autism Behavior Checklist (ABC)and the Childhood Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ). The ABCis a screening tool with 57 items across 5 subscales: sensory, social relating, body and object use, language, and social self-help, with higher scores indicating more severe symptoms. A total score less than 53 is negative, 53 to 67 is positive, and 68 or higher supports an autism diagnosis. The CSHQis a parent-report tool to assess children's sleep patterns through 50 items across 8 sleep dimensions. Each item is rated on a 3-point Likert scale based on frequency, and a score of 41 or higher suggests probable sleep problems. All 3 assessments were administered by 2 evaluators each, who were qualified pediatricians or occupational therapists, at baseline and after 20 sessions of tPCS. Participants' final scores were the mean score from both raters.

Masking

The active and sham tPCS devices were visually and operationally indistinguishable. They were located in separate treatment rooms with identical setup at each site to prevent group interaction. Participants and their parents returned to the same room for all 20 sessions. All participants were tPCS naive and informed that any sensations experienced were typical. Room assignments for sham or active treatments were randomized. Outcome assessors were masked to group allocation because they were not involved in randomization, allocation, or treatment. Study staff administering tPCS treatments were unaware of group allocation and treated 1 group exclusively. Despite the absence of a formal blinding evaluation, these measures minimized the risk of deducing group allocation because the chance of comparing treatment responses and adverse effects between groups was remote.

Introduction

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a common, heterogenous neurodevelopmental disorder. According to a 2020 survey in the US, there is 1 case of ASD in every 36 children aged 8 years. Clinical presentation is often characterized by deficits in social interaction, communication, and stereotyped behaviors. Additionally, sleep dysfunctions are frequent in ASD, and can exacerbate daytime behavioral challenges, leading to caretaker burnout.

Animal and human studies have established genetic risk factorsand environmental influencesas significant contributors to the development of ASD; however, the precise causes remain unclear. The consensus is that ASD symptoms are caused by impaired brain function associated with aberrant functional connectivity, abnormal plasticity, and disruptions in excitation and inhibition (E/I) balance in cortical circuits, that characterize dysfunctional neurocognitive reorganization during development, negatively impacting social cognition, language comprehension, and executive function. Currently, there is no known cure for ASD. Standard of care mainly encompasses a combination of behavioral therapiesand antipsychotic medications to manage challenging behaviors. However, pharmacologic interventions may lead to adverse effects, while behavioral therapies are expensive and time-consuming, which affects treatment adherence. Meta-analyses of these interventions show controversial effectiveness; thus, there is a pressing need for interventions that can augment their efficacy or the development of novel treatments.

A promising approach is transcranial pulsed current stimulation (tPCS), a type of noninvasive brain stimulation technique that modulates cortical activity via surface scalp electrodes by delivering low-intensity pulsed currents (< 2 mA) at a predetermined frequency to the cortex. tPCS modifies electroencephalography band power in a frequency-specific manner, modulates functional connectivity, facilitates interhemispheric coherence, and enhances cortical plasticity. In Singapore, 400-Hz tPCShas received regulatory approval for treatment of spasticity in children with cerebral palsy, supporting its safety in pediatric populations and encouraging the exploration in other conditions. The effects of tPCS in ASD have not been investigated, but studies involving transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)targeting the prefrontal cortex and cerebellum have shown positive effects on core ASD symptoms. Compared with tDCS, tPCS incorporates higher stimulation frequencies that encounter less scalp impedanceand can induce neurophysiologic responses at lower intensities via temporal summation.

An elevated E/I ratio, has been frequently reported in the prefrontal region of individuals with ASD. The observed improvement in social functioning may have been due to the reduction in excitability in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex by cathodal tPCS, mediated by both the negative polarity and the effects of the higher-frequency pulses in the tPCS waveform linked to mechanisms such as activation of inhibitory interneuronsand desynchronization of excitatory neuronal activity. Our findings were consistent with the results of 2 previous studies, that used cathodal stimulation (20-minute, 1.5-mA tDCS, 10 sessions) over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in adolescents with ASD and also reported improved social functioning. In one of these studies, a significant reduction in the θ-band E/I ratio in cortical midline structures related to sociocognitive information processing was demonstrated after treatment.

Cerebellar abnormalities, and reduced frontal-posterior connectivitywere consistently associated with ASD. A previous studydemonstrated that stimulating Purkinje cells in the cerebellar right crus I enhanced its connectivity with the medial prefrontal connectivity and rescued social impairments in ASD-variant mice. Although the exact mechanism was unclear, we postulated that the anodal 400-Hz tPCS over the right cerebellum contributed to the results by modulating dysfunctional ASD-relevant cerebellar circuitsinvolved in social, and communicative functions, enhancing contralateral frontal-posterior connectivityand thereby improving social functioning.

In our study, we assessed the effect of tPCS on sleep in children with ASD as a secondary objective because poor sleep has been associated with worsening ASD symptoms. After treatment, the baseline-adjusted CSHQ total mean score differed significantly between groups, with the active tPCS group showing notable improvement in daytime sleepiness compared with the sham tPCS group. We speculated that the tPCS associated improvement may have been due to the anodal tPCS over the right cerebellum, which could have modulated cerebellar circuits involved in regulating circadian rhythmsand sleep processes. Notably, in other studies involving children with ASDand patients with bipolar disease, sleep improvements were also observed when a cerebellar montage was used. Although tPCS was observed to reduce ATEC and CSHQ total scores, in our exploratory post hoc analysis, the improvement in sleep was not significantly associated with the improvement in social functioning, suggesting independent mechanisms. This finding was aligned with a systematic reviewthat found insufficient evidence to establish a causal relationship between sleep quality and social functioning in children with ASD.

Discussion

These findings represent the first report, to our knowledge, of the effects of tPCS in children with ASD in an adequately powered, multicenter, double-blind, sham-controlled randomized clinical trial. A total of 312 participants completed the study after being randomly assigned to receive 20 sessions of either sham tPCS or active tPCS (0.7 mA, 20 minutes per session) over 4 weeks in addition to standard therapy. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of tPCS on social functioning in children with ASD, using the ATEC as the primary outcome measure and the ABC as an alternative assessment. The secondary objective of the study was to investigate the effect of tPCS on sleep dysfunctions in children with ASD, using the CSHQ as the outcome measure.

Results demonstrated that tPCS significantly enhanced social functioning in children with ASD, evidenced by a significant posttreatment difference in baseline-adjusted ATEC total mean scores, which was driven by greater sociability improvements in the active tPCS group. Other ATEC subdomains showed no significant group differences. The ABC assessment confirmed the primary outcome, with posttreatment baseline-adjusted ABC total mean scores showing significant differences between groups. In the ABC subdomain analyses, the active tPCS group had significant improvements in sensory scores and clinically meaningful gains in language abilities compared with the sham tPCS group. However, the language subdomain lost significance after applying a conservative Bonferroni correction, chosen due to the study's pioneering nature in tPCS research for ASD. It would have remained significant with less stringent corrections. Additionally, the ATEC and ABC were primarily designed to evaluate individual changes over time rather than group comparisons; thus, the small effect sizes observed between groups may still hold clinical significance.

Abbreviations: ABC, Autism Behavior Checklist; ATEC, Autism Treatment Evaluation Checklist; CSHQ, Childhood Sleep Habits Questionnaire.

Exploratory analyses, which used a 10% or greater reduction in posttreatment scores as a benchmark for clinically meaningful change, revealed that 84 of 155 participants (54.2%) in the active tPCS group achieved this outcome with the ATEC total score compared with 48 of 157 (30.6%) in the sham tPCS group. Similarly, 63 of 155 (40.6%) in the active tPCS group achieved this outcome with the ABC scores, nearly double the 31 of 157 (19.7%) in the sham tPCS group (eTables 2 and 3 in Supplement 2).

Safety and Adverse Events

Throughout the study, both sham tPCS and active tPCS were well tolerated by all participants. No serious adverse events were reported. Adverse effects reported were limited to mild headache (n = 19) and temporary scalp redness (n = 27) underneath the electrode sites, which self-resolved within 30 minutes after stimulation cessation (eTable 1 in Supplement 2). No participants from either group withdrew from the study due to adverse reactions.

Results

Participants

A total of 476 potential participants from inpatient or community outreach were assessed for eligibility (Figure). Of these, 340 met the criteria and were randomized 1:1 into the 2 groups (170 per group). Before treatment began, 14 participants were excluded due to the use of antipsychotics or nonapproved concomitant treatments. After treatment commenced, 11 participants discontinued due to travel restrictions, and 3 participants left without specifying a reason.

Outcomes and Estimation

After treatment, the mean (SD) ATEC total score was 67.0 (22.3) in the sham tPCS group and 60.1 (20.0) in the active tPCS group, with mean (SD) score reductions of −4.13 (8.7) points (5.8%) and −7.17 (10.5) points (10.7%), respectively. ANCOVA revealed significantly greater improvement in the active tPCS group compared with the sham tPCS group (difference, −3.50; 95% CI, −5.56 to −1.43; P < .001; effect size, 0.04), driven by a significant difference in the sociability subdomain (difference, −1.72; 95% CI, −2.57 to −0.88; P < .001; effect size, 0.05). Other ATEC subdomains showed no significant differences.

We conducted a multicenter, double-blind, sham-controlled randomized clinical trial of an evaluable population involving 8 hospitals in China (Guangzhou University of Traditional Chinese Medicine affiliated Nanhai Maternity and Children's Hospital, Dongguan City Maternal and Child Health Hospital, Zhanjiang City Maternal and Child Health Hospital, Luoding City Maternal and Child Health Hospital, Meizhou City Meixian District Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital, Guangzhou Angel Children's Hospital, Shenzhen Luogang District Maternal and Child Health Hospital, and Foshan City Sichuang Special Needs Education School and Hospital). Centralized ethics approval was obtained from the Nanhai Maternity and Children's Hospital Research Ethics Committee. The study was performed in compliance with ethical standards established in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent was obtained from parents or legal guardians of all participants. Additionally, children 6 years or older who were capable of understanding the nature of the study provided their assent. The study adhered to the Standard Protocol Items: Recommendation for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT)and the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials reporting guidelines. The trial protocol can be found in Supplement 1.

Participants

Eligible participants were children aged 3 to 14 years diagnosed with ASD according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fifth Edition) criteriaand an IQ of 35 higher on the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence, Fourth Editionfor those aged 3 to 6 years and Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, Fourth Editionfor those aged 7 to 14 years. The recruitment period was from May 1, 2022, through November 30, 2023. Nonverbal subtests were used for nonverbal participants to ensure accurate evaluation of intellectual potential. Diagnosis of ASD was established by child psychiatrists, and IQ assessment by educational specialists. Exclusion criteria included epilepsy; craniotomy; implanted devices; severe psychiatric conditions (eg, psychosis, schizophrenia); active scalp infection; obstructive sleep apnea; active benzodiazepine, risperidone, or haloperidol use; or prior noninvasive brain stimulation. Centralized randomization across the 8 centers (1:1 to the active tPCS or sham tPCS group) was performed using SPSS software, version 27.0 (IBM Inc). Participants received sealed envelopes in order of their visits, which on opening determined their group allocation. The randomization list was kept confidential by an uninvolved administrator.

### Transcranial pulsed current stimulation and social functioning in children with autism: a randomized clinical trial [^a1b1eb21]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

For secondary outcome measures, after treatment, the mean (SD) ABC total score was 66.3 (18.1) for the sham tPCS group and 64.2 (15.7) for the active tPCS group, with mean (SD) score reductions of −1.6 (8.6) points (2.4%) and −6.0 (7.7) points (8.5%), respectively. ANCOVA revealed a significantly greater improvement in the active tPCS group (difference, −4.00; 95% CI, −5.75 to −2.26; P < .001; effect size, 0.06), underscored by a significant difference in the sensory subdomain (difference, −0.86; 95% CI, −1.50 to −0.22; P = 0.009; effect size, 0.02). None of the other ABC subdomains were significant. In assessing sleep changes, the posttreatment mean (SD) CSHQ total score was 56.3 (16.7) for the sham tPCS group and 53.2 (17.4) for the active tPCS group, with mean (SD) score reductions of −1.9 (3.9) points (3.3%) in the sham tPCS group and −4.2 (5.2) points (7.3%) in the active tPCS group. ANCOVA revealed greater improvement in the active tPCS group (difference, −2.19; 95% CI, −3.20 to −1.19; P < .001; effect size, 0.06), particularly in the daytime sleepiness (difference, −0.85; 95% CI, −1.30 to −0.39; P < .001; effect size, 0.04). None of the other CSHQ subdomains were significant (Table 2). Exploratory post hoc linear regression indicated that the improvement in CSHQ total score was not significantly associated with the improvement (reduction) in ATEC total score of the participants in either group (active tPCS group: R² linear = 0.02, P = 0.06; sham tPCS group: R² linear = 0.005, P = 0.39) (eFigure 2 in Supplement 2).

Statistical Analysis

All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS Statistics for Windows, version 27.0 (IBM Inc) and included all participants in a completer analysis. Data normality was assessed with the Shapiro-Wilk test. At baseline, t tests and χ² tests were used to examine whether there was any difference in the continuous and categorical variables between the 2 groups. Analyses of covariance (ANCOVAs) were used to examine the difference between the intervention and control groups for both primary and secondary outcomes after the intervention, after accounting for the baseline values. The Bonferroni correction was applied to control for multiple comparisons. A 2-sided P < .05 was considered statistically significant.

### Transcranial pulsed current stimulation and social functioning in children with autism: a randomized clinical trial [^878c9837]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Limitations

This study has some limitations. A total of 88.5% of our sample consisted of children younger than 7 years (276 of 312 children) who did not consume benzodiazepines, risperidone, or haloperidol. This might limit the generalizability of the results to older children with ASD and those who rely on these medications. Although blinding measures were in place, the study did not include a formal blinding evaluation. The study also lacked resources to perform tests on changes in frontal E/I ratios or functional connectivity that may be linked to behavioral changes. Future studies should investigate the mechanisms behind these effects. Long-term follow-up of participants was not conducted due to logistical challenges with COVID-19 restrictions. Despite these limitations, the study was adequately powered and resulted in significant improvements in social functioning and sleep with a lower dose of 0.7 mA compared with doses of 1 to 1.5 mA used in similar studies, potentially enhancing safety for pediatric use.

### Transcranial direct current stimulation vs sham for the treatment of inattention in adults with attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder: the TUNED randomized clinical trial [^22d1d69d]. JAMA Psychiatry (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) may improve symptoms of inattention in adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, previous trials are characterized by small sample sizes, heterogeneous methodologies, and short treatment periods using clinic-based tDCS.

Objective

To determine the efficacy and safety of home-based tDCS in treating inattention symptoms in adult patients with ADHD.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Randomized, double-blind, parallel, sham-controlled clinical trial (tDCS for the Treatment of Inattention Symptoms in Adult Patients With ADHD [TUNED]), conducted from July 2019 through July 2021 in a single-center outpatient academic setting. Of 277 potential participants screened by phone, 150 were assessed for eligibility on site, and 64 were included. Participants were adults with ADHD, inattentive or combined subtype. Exclusion criteria included current stimulant drug treatment, current moderate to severe symptoms of depression or anxiety, diagnosis of bipolar disorder with a manic or depressive episode in the last year, diagnosis of schizophrenia or another psychotic disorder, and diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder; 55 of participants completed follow-up after 4 weeks.

Interventions

Thirty-minute daily sessions of home-based tDCS for 4 weeks, 2 mA anodal-right and cathodal-left prefrontal stimulation with 35-cm2 carbon electrodes.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Inattentive scores in the clinician-administered version of the Adult ADHD Self-report Scale version 1.1 (CASRS-I).

Results

Included in this trial were 64 participants with ADHD (31 [48%] inattentive presentation and 33 [52%] combined presentation), with a mean (SD) age of 38.3 (9.6) years. Thirty participants (47%) were women and 34 (53%) were men. Fifty-five finished the trial. At week 4, the mean (SD) inattention score, as measured with CASRS-I, was 18.88 (5.79) in the active tDCS group and 23.63 (3.97) in the sham tDCS group. Linear mixed-effects models revealed a statistically significant treatment by time interaction for CASRS-I (βinteraction = -3.18; 95% CI, -4.60 to -1.75; P < .001), showing decreased symptoms of inattention in the active tDCS group over the 3 assessments compared to the sham tDCS group. Mild adverse events were more frequent in the active tDCS group, particularly skin redness, headache, and scalp burn.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this randomized clinical trial, daily treatment with a home-based tDCS device over 4 weeks improved attention in adult patients with ADHD who were not taking stimulant medication. Home-based tDCS could be a nonpharmacological alternative for patients with ADHD.

### Long-term effects of transcranial direct current stimulation in the treatment of autism spectrum disorder: a randomized controlled trial [^5331f40c]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Aim

To compare the efficacy of 0, 5, and 20 sessions of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) for reducing symptoms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD).

Method

Thirty-six male children with ASD (mean age 2years 3months, SD 4months, age range 1years 6months-2years 11months) were balanced and stratified by age, sex, and baseline severity of ASD, to: (1) a control group that received 20 sessions of sham tDCS; (2) a 5-session tDCS group (5-tDCS) that received 5 sessions of active tDCS followed by 15 sessions of sham tDCS; and (3) a 20-session tDCS group (20-tDCS) that received 20 sessions of active tDCS. All groups participated in the special school activity of Khon Kaen Special Education Center, Thailand. The primary outcome was autism severity as measured by the Childhood Autism Severity Scale.

Results

The 5-tDCS and 20-tDCS groups evidenced greater reductions in autism severity than the control group at days 5 and 14, and months 6 and 12. There were no significant differences in the outcome between the 5- and 20-tDCS groups at any time point. Within-group analysis showed clinically meaningful improvements starting at month 6 for the participants in the control group, and clinically meaningful improvements starting on day 5 in both active tDCS groups, all of which were maintained to month 12.

Interpretation

The 5- and 20-session tDCS seems to reduce autism severity faster than sham tDCS. These effects maintained at least for 1year.

What This Paper Adds

Twenty sessions of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) were not superior to five sessions. Sham tDCS with a special school activity can reduce autism severity starting at 6months after treatment. The benefits observed for 5 and 20 sessions of tDCS last for at least 12months.

### The effect of combined transcranial pulsed current stimulation and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation on lower limb spasticity in children with spastic cerebral palsy: a randomized and controlled clinical study [^64034038]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Safety considerations

In the present study, safety issues were identified a priori by the authors who, on average, have over 20 years of pediatric clinical experience in China. The tPCS used for cortical stimulation in the study belonged to the category of low-intensity transcranial electrical stimulation and no serious adverse events (SAEs) have been reported so far in over 18,000 sessions administered to healthy subjects, as well as in neurological and psychiatric patients. Moderate adverse events (AEs), as defined by the necessity to intervene, are rare, and include skin burns due to suboptimal electrode-skin contact. Mild side effects of transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) such as itching, tingling, burning sensations, and transient redness may occur during treatment.

For safety of tES on children, the recommended dose needs to compensate for thinner skull and lower resistance. Mattai et al. explored the safety and tolerability of tDCS in children with childhood-onset schizophrenia and found that 10 sessions of 2 mA tDCS for 20 min, 25 cm electrodes, were administered without incident in the test subjects with no serious side effects. Furthermore, a study by Jaberzadeh that compared tPCS to tDCS showed that participants tolerated a-tPCS better than the conventional a-tDCS. In the present study, tPCS (unidirectional monophasic pulse square wave) was controlled at 1 mA, 30 min per session, which is within the confines of conventional tES and safe for children. In addition, our study design passed the safety review conducted by Guangzhou City Social Welfare Institute Rehabilitation Hospital Ethics committee, who gave approval for this study.

### Transcranial direct current stimulation in child and adolescent psychiatric disorders [^cdb33894]. Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Research involving transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in child and adolescent psychiatry is limited. Early, short-term studies have found tDCS to be safe and well-tolerated in youth with neurodevelopmental disorders (attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism, learning disorders). Preliminary data suggest potential utility in symptom reduction and improving cognitive function. Further careful research considering implications for the developing brain is necessary.

### Transcranial direct current stimulation in children with autism spectrum disorder: a systematic scoping review [^d4d89b39]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Aim

Our aim was to review available studies which test transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to reduce symptom severity in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).

Method

We performed a systematic scoping review in PubMed and PsychINFO databases for studies employing tDCS in children and adolescents with ASD.

Results

We found five studies (two small randomized controlled studies, one experimental study, one quasi-experimental study, and one case study) reporting positive effects of tDCS in ASD symptom reduction. Study design varied greatly and sample size ranged from 1 to 20 patients.

Interpretation

Preliminary evidence is encouraging of the potential usefulness of tDCS for treatment of ASD in children and adolescents. It suggests tentative support for reductions in symptom severity and, according to parental reports and clinical observations, improvements in some aspects of language. However, the evidence is sparse and of low quality, so the true effect of tDCS is likely to be substantially different from the estimate of effect in this review. Therefore, future randomized controlled trials are needed to draw conclusions regarding tDCS efficacy in paediatric samples with ASD.

What This Paper Adds

There is low confidence in the estimate of effect, but tentatively encouraging results warrant further investigation.

### Therapeutic applications of noninvasive neuromodulation in children and adolescents [^fda7bdb5]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Recent advances and growing evidence supporting the safety and efficacy of noninvasive neuromodulatory techniques in adults have facilitated the study of neuromodulation applications in children and adolescents. Noninvasive brain stimulation methods such as transcranial direct current stimulation and transcranial magnetic stimulation have been considered in children with depression, autism spectrum disorder, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, and other neuropsychiatric disorders. However, current clinical applications of neuromodulation techniques in children and adolescents are nascent. There is a great need for developmentally informed, large, double-blinded, randomized, controlled clinical trials to demonstrate efficacy and safety of noninvasive brain stimulation in children and adolescents.

### Anodal transcranial direct-current stimulation and non-verbal intelligence in autism spectrum disorder: a randomized controlled trial [^ece3b7e9]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Aim

To understand the impact of anodal transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS) on non-verbal intelligence in high-functioning young adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).

Method

Thirty individuals with ASD were randomly divided into three groups receiving 2mA, 20minutes daily anodal tDCS for 10 sessions. Group A received 10 sham tDCS sessions, group B five real followed by five sham sessions, and group C received 10 real tDCS sessions. The total score of non-verbal intelligence was measured using the Test of Nonverbal Intelligence, Fourth Edition. The left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (LDLPFC) was targeted using the International 10–20 electroencephalography system, and concurrent cognitive training was avoided.

Results

Group C demonstrated a mean difference of 4.10 (95% confidence interval 1.41–6.79; p = 0.005) in Test of Nonverbal Intelligence scores compared with group A, with an effect size of 0.47. No significant differences were observed between groups A and B (p = 0.296), or between groups B and C (p = 0.140).

Interpretation

Ten sessions of anodal tDCS to the LDLPFC led to improved non-verbal intelligence among individuals with ASD. These results emphasize the potential of tDCS as a discrete method for boosting cognitive abilities in the high-functioning population with ASD. Future studies with larger groups of participants and extended observation periods are necessary to validate these findings.

### Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in children with ADHD: a randomized, sham-controlled pilot study [^0d076ac6]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

ADHD is a common neurodevelopmental disorder with a pediatric prevalence of 5.2%. While medication treatment for ADHD is effective, it does not address all symptoms and a small but notable subgroup does not respond to medications. Adverse effects limit its use and some parents and participants resist use of medication. Thus, limitations of medication treatment for ADHD motivate searching for other therapeutic options. Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) has been suggested as a treatment for children with ADHD, with mixed results to date. Protocol variables employed, including combined use of cognitive training (CT) and scheduling of sessions, may explain diverse findings to date. The aim of this study was to examine safety, feasibility and efficacy of tDCS combined with CT provided three-times-per week for one-month to treat children with ADHD.

Methods

In a double blind, randomized, sham-controlled pilot study, 25 children with ADHD were randomized to receive 12 sessions of either anodal tDCS or sham-tDCS for 20 min combined with CT three-times-per-week for four weeks. The tDCS anode was over left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and cathode over vertex. Assessments were obtained prior to, after 6 sessions, 12 sessions and one-month after intervention.

Results

No significant post-intervention differences were found between those receiving tDCS or sham-tDCS. Both groups demonstrated significant improvement on questionnaire measures of ADHD and executive function with mixed results seen on computerized performance measures. Overall, adverse effects were mild with no significant difference between groups. However, three children, all from the tDCS group, experienced headaches with two requiring temporary cessation and one requiring removal from the study.

Conclusions

Anodal tDCS to the DLPFC using the above protocol in children with ADHD did not demonstrate additional treatment benefits beyond that of CT.

### Cerebellar transcranial direct current stimulation in the cerebellar cognitive affective syndrome: a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled trial [^2b055ff8]. Movement Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

The cerebellar cognitive affective syndrome (CCAS) encompasses cognitive and affective symptoms in patients with cerebellar disorders, for which no proven treatment is available.

Objectives

Our primary objective was to study the effect of cerebellar anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on cognitive performance in CCAS patients. Secondary effects on ataxia severity, mood, and quality of life were explored.

Methods

We performed a randomized, double‐blind, sham‐controlled trial. Thirty‐five patients with CCAS were included and received 10 sessions of 20 minutes sham (n = 17) or real (n = 18) tDCS, with a current of 2 mA. Cognitive performance was assessed using executive function subtests of the computerized Test of Attentional Performance (TAP), with the composite as primary endpoint. Secondary outcomes were ataxia severity, mood, and quality of life. Outcomes were evaluated 1, 3, 6, and 12 months post‐intervention.

Results

Cerebellar tDCS was well tolerated and no serious adverse events related to the intervention occurred. No significant tDCS effect was found on cognitive performance. Improvement on the TAP was observed in the sham group 1 month post‐treatment (estimate = −0.248, 95% CI, −0.49 to −0.01), but not clinically relevant. A positive tDCS effect was observed for ataxia severity 1 month post‐treatment (estimate = −0.985, 95% CI, −1.94 to −0.03).

Conclusions

Ten sessions of 20 minutes cerebellar anodal tDCS did not prove efficacious for CCAS‐related cognitive impairment, but a significant positive effect of tDCS was found for ataxia severity, aligning with previous findings indicative of tDCS as a therapeutic neuromodulation tool in cerebellar disorders. © 2024 The Author(s).

### Prefrontal transcranial direct current stimulation in pediatric attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder: a randomized clinical trial [^070792fe]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has the potential to be a sustainable treatment option in pediatric attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), but rigorously controlled multicenter clinical trials using state-of-the-art stimulation techniques are lacking.

Objectives

To determine effect sizes of changes in cognitive and clinical measures and to assess safety and tolerability in the course of optimized multichannel tDCS over prefrontal target regions in pediatric ADHD.

Design, Setting, and Participants

In the sham-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group randomized clinical trial E-StimADHD (Improving Neuropsychological Functions and Clinical Course in Children and Adolescents With ADHD With Anodal Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation of the Prefrontal Cortex: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Sham-Controlled, Parallel Group Trial Using an Uncertified Class IIa Device) with 2 independent study arms, participants were enrolled from September 15, 2018, to August 10, 2021, and follow-up was completed October 4, 2021. Data were analyzed January 26, 2022, to November 8, 2023. The trial was conducted at the departments of child and adolescent psychiatry or pediatrics of 5 university hospitals in Portugal and Germany. Youths 10 to 18 years of age with ADHD according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (all presentations), an IQ of at least 80, and the ability to refrain from stimulant medication during participation in the trial were eligible.

Interventions

Optimized multichannel anodal tDCS or sham stimulation (1 mA, 20 minutes) targeting the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (lDLPFC; study A) or the right inferior frontal gyrus (rIFG; study B) was applied in 10 sessions, concurrent with performance on a cognitive target task (study A, working memory assessed in the n-back task; study B, interference control assessed in the flanker task).

Main Outcomes and Measures

Effect sizes for changes in accuracy measures (d-prime or flanker effect) in the target tasks assessed after the intervention. Primary analyses were based on the modified intention-to-treat set.

Results

This study included 69 youths (54 [78%] male) with a median age of 13.3 years (IQR, 11.9–14.9 years). Compared with sham tDCS, verum stimulation of the lDLPFC led to significantly lower working memory accuracy (effect size, -0.43 [95% CI, -0.68 to -0.17]; P = 0.001). Stimulation of the rIFG significantly improved interference control (effect size, 0.30 [95% CI, 0.04–0.56]; P = 0.02). Adverse events were mostly mild and transient and did not occur more often in the verum group. For example, the most frequent adverse events were headache (sham, n = 30; verum, n = 20), nasopharyngitis (sham, n = 11; verum, n = 5), and feeling of electric discharge (sham, n = 5; verum, n = 3).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this randomized clinical trial, prefrontal anodal tDCS induced small- to medium-sized effects in youths with ADHD, with only mild and transient adverse events. The optimized multichannel montage chosen to target the lDLPFC, however, decreased working memory performance. This unexpected finding stresses the importance of incorporating insights from basic research on the mechanisms and preconditions of successful tDCS in future study designs to advance application of tDCS in pediatric ADHD.

### Evaluating the feasibility, safety and efficacy of accelerated continuous theta-burst stimulation targeting the left primary motor cortex to improve social communication impairment in children with autism [^5eb95645]. General Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

To examine the potential efficacy of a-cTBS, we performed a post hoc analysis by comparing the longitudinal changes in SRS between the trial participants and a historical control group. The control group was identified from the Shanghai Autism Early Development (SAED) cohort who had completed both an initial SRS assessment at diagnosis and a voluntary follow-up SRS evaluation 30–50 days thereafter (aligned with the mean 40-day interval in the a-cTBS trial). We excluded individuals exhibiting characteristics that were exclusive in only one group and then applied the inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) approach to balance baseline characteristics, including sex, age, full-scale intelligence quotient and Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS), using the ipw package (V.1.2). We used the standardised mean difference (SMD) to assess the differences in baseline characteristics between the two groups before and after IPTW. Given the limited sample size, we applied an SMD threshold of less than 0.15 as an acceptable level of balance. We used a weighted longitudinal mixed-effect model to assess the average treatment effect of a-cTBS by the coefficient of the interaction term of a-cTBS (0 for control, 1 for treatment) × Time (0 for pretreatment, 1 for 1-month follow-up). Robust 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated by bootstrap. The analyses were initially employed in the primary outcome, the SRS total score, and were then performed similarly in the five subscales of SRS. Additional analyses for the primary outcome included (1) a longitudinal mixed-effect model, in which time was coded as a continuous variable (in days), and (2) a weighted linear model adjusting for the baseline SRS total score.

### Evaluating the feasibility, safety and efficacy of accelerated continuous theta-burst stimulation targeting the left primary motor cortex to improve social communication impairment in children with autism [^0a8da368]. General Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

To the editor:

Social communication impairment (SCI) is a core symptom of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and evidence-based interventions targeting this domain remain limited. In the past decade, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), one of the most commonly applied non-invasive neurostimulation techniques, has shown efficacy in treating neuropsychiatric disorders, such as depression. This success raised hope that rTMS could be a promising therapeutic intervention for ASD. Although prior trials have suggested the potential efficacy of rTMS in improving SCI in ASD, the results were inconclusive, largely due to considerable heterogeneity in stimulation protocols and methodological limitations.

The primary motor cortex (M1) is crucial for action execution, emotion evaluation and language comprehension. In addition, individuals with ASD exhibit atypical neuroplasticity profiles upon stimulation of M1. These suggest that M1 could be a potential therapeutic target for addressing SCI in individuals with ASD. However, there has been no rTMS trial targeting M1 to examine its effects on ASD core symptoms. Most previous trials enrolled only autistic adults or children without intellectual disability, primarily due to the necessity of maintaining a prolonged stationary position during rTMS sessions. Continuous theta-burst stimulation (cTBS), a novel form of rTMS, reduces the stimulation duration while achieving comparable or even superior neuromodulatory effects. Moreover, the accelerated design, characterised by spaced sessions with higher pulse doses, may enhance and sustain neuromodulatory effects while reducing the treatment course to just a few days, potentially improving both compliance and overall efficacy. We integrated these considerations and developed a novel accelerated cTBS (a-cTBS) protocol targeting the left M1 for therapeutic intervention and involvement of a broader autistic population. In this study, we conducted an open-label trial to assess the feasibility, safety and efficacy of the novel 5-day a-cTBS intervention among children with ASD (online supplemental figure S1).

### Noninvasive neuromodulation for disorders of consciousness: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^8e1bf882]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Data extraction and quality assessment

Three authors independently screened for eligible trials and extracted data. Full-texts were assessed and relevant data (trial designs, patient characteristics, intervention protocol, and TRIAL REGISTERATION NUMBER) were extracted from the articles included. Disagreements for study inclusion and data extraction were resolved by discussion with a third author.

We evaluated methodological quality using the PEDro Scale, a score of ≥ six points was rated good quality, and a score of ≤ five points was considered poor quality. We used ROB 2 to assess the risk of bias at study level. The overall risk of bias measured by RoB 2 was classified as low, some concerns, or high, based on the following five domains, randomization process, deviations from intended interventions, missing outcome data, measurement of the outcome, selection of the reported result.

Data analysis

We used R software (version 4.4.1; "metafor" package) to construct forest plots for efficacy and safety outcomes. Where possible, sufficient data was entered into meta-analyses, excluding studies with high risk of bias. We calculated the mean changes and SDs for primary and secondary efficacy outcomes between enrollment and post intervention or at the end of follow-up accordingly. The phase one data in three crossover trials were collected from the tables for the combined meta-analyses. While data in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLFPC) tDCS subgroup (study one) from Wu and colleagues in 2019 are significantly screwed away from normality, study two in this trial examining right DLPFC tDCS vs. sham stimulation were included in the combined meta-analysis. We used a pooled Hedges' g to synthesis continuous data, a pooled risk ratio (RR) to combine dichotomous data, both with 95% confidence interval (CI). The magnitude of Hedges' g was categorized small < 0.3, and 0.3 ≤ medium < 0.6, and large ≥ 0.6. We used a random effects model to assess whether the pooled effects for efficacy and safety outcomes were significant (p ≤ 0.05). We assessed between-study heterogeneity using between-study variance (τ²), I² statistic and p value. We classified the between-study heterogeneity as low (< 25%), moderate (25–75%), or high (> 75%). Additionally, we assessed the certainty of evidence for efficacy and safety outcomes using the GRADE methodology.

### The effect of combined transcranial pulsed current stimulation and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation on lower limb spasticity in children with spastic cerebral palsy: a randomized and controlled clinical study [^0d61fbb8]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) has been proposed as a possible mechanism to manage spasticity as it can be used repeatedly to target cortical regions, activating or inhibiting neural activity in the cortex, which may influence the descending inhibitory input to the dorsal reticulospinal and corticospinal tracts, leading to a reduction of excitatory inputs from the medial reticulospinal and vestibulospinal tracts that ultimately causes spasticity. Upon review of the relevant literature, NIBS studies on CP children that used transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) have shown significant improvements in upper limb spasticity, gait, and balance. However, these samples did not include severe SCP children of GMFCS levels III–V. To our knowledge, there is only one NIBS study involving children with spastic quadriplegia in which high frequency (5 Hz) repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) was used to treat upper limb spasticity; however, measured outcomes using Ashworth scale tests failed to reach significance. Moreover, there are not yet studies that have investigated the effects of NIBS on lower limb spasticity in children with SCP in GMFCS levels III–V. Transcranial pulsed current stimulation (tPCS) is a novel type of NIBS that has recently gained increasing attention in experimental settings, delivering pulsed currents at a predetermined frequency to the cortex, as opposed to the direct current provided by tDCS. While there are yet no studies done involving tPCS and children with SCP, the safety of tPCS had been investigated in the treatment of Parkinson's disease, with no adverse events recorded, and post-treatment results showed significant improvement in gait and balance. A recent fMRI study observed aberrant functional connectivity within the cerebellum, sensorimotor, left frontoparietal, and salience network in children with SCP when compared to healthy controls. As tPCS in the literature had been demonstrated to reliably induce an enhancement of corticospinal excitability, increase the power and connectivity of endogenously generated brain oscillation in a frequency-specific manner, and has a facilitatory effect on interhemispheric connectivity, this NIBS modality may present a suitable method to address possible pathophysiological mechanism related to SCP.

Previous studies indicate that transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a promising emerging treatment option for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and its efficacy could be augmented using concurrent training. However, no intrastimulation social cognition training for ASD has been developed so far. The objective of this two-armed, double-blind, randomized, sham-controlled clinical trial is to investigate the effects of tDCS combined with a newly developed intrastimulation social cognition training on adolescents with ASD. Twenty-two male adolescents with ASD were randomly assigned to receive 10 sessions of either anodal or sham tDCS at F3/right supraorbital region together with online intrastimulation training comprising basic and complex emotion recognition tasks. Using baseline magnetic resonance imaging data, individual electric field distributions were simulated, and brain activation patterns of the training tasks were analyzed. Additionally, questionnaires were administered at baseline and following the intervention. Compared to sham tDCS, anodal tDCS significantly improved dynamic emotion recognition over the course of the sessions. This task also showed the highest activations in face processing regions. Moreover, the improvement was associated with electric field density at the medial prefrontal cortex and social awareness in exploratory analyses. Both groups showed high tolerability and acceptability of tDCS, and significant improvement in overall ASD symptoms. Taken together, multisession tDCS improved dynamic emotion recognition in adolescents with ASD using a task that activates brain regions associated with the social brain network. The variability in the electric field might diminish tDCS effects and future studies should investigate individualized approaches.

### Evaluating the feasibility, safety and efficacy of accelerated continuous theta-burst stimulation targeting the left primary motor cortex to improve social communication impairment in children with autism [^8b12fd4a]. General Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Table 1
The longitudinal changes in language abilities and their correlation with ΔSRS 1mon among children with ASD aged 4–10 years receiving the a-cTBS intervention

In summary, our findings showed that 5-day a-cTBS targeting the left M1 in children with ASD is feasible, safe and might have a treatment effect on SCI. Specifically, this effect was observed immediately after the 5-day treatment and persisted up to the 1-month follow-up. Additionally, greater responsiveness in the 1-month changes in SRS showed a trend toward an increase in single-word comprehension scores.

Our study has several strengths. First, the novel neurostimulation protocol addressed the research gap by including young children and children with intellectual disabilities, populations that are often under-represented in similar studies. Second, we observed a potential treatment effect of a-cTBS targeting the left M1 on SCI in children with ASD, suggesting M1 may be a candidate therapeutic target for ASD. Moreover, in our protocol, M1 is easy to localise by motor-evoked potential measurement instead of neurological navigation, which confers practical advantages in a clinical setting. Third, compared with behavioural interventions for children with ASD, such as applied behaviour analysis that requires intensive engagement with professional therapists for several years, our neurostimulation protocol is easier to operate and more generalisable. Limitations of this study include its open-label design, the potential influence of the placebo effect and the absence of supplemental objective measurement tools for assessing social impairment. Future randomised controlled trials are warranted to more rigorously evaluate the therapeutic efficacy.

### Safety of rTMS for schizophrenia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^7b111ac8]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2025). Medium credibility.

Given the substantial heterogeneity in rTMS parameters, we also calculated the prevalence of side effects for each rTMS target and stimulation protocol (see Supplemental Tables 4–17). For each stimulation target, we compared the prevalence of side effects with active rTMS at that target to the side effect prevalence with any sham stimulation. To compare side effects between stimulation protocols, we grouped stimulation by high frequency, low frequency, iTBS, or cTBS. For each stimulation group, we compared the prevalence of side effects with active rTMS for a given stimulation protocol to the side effect prevalence with any sham stimulation. We included studies that tested two active targets or two active protocols if they reported the side effects for each specific target or protocol. Six studies administered rTMS to multiple brain targets. We excluded four of these studies from analysis, as they did not report side effect by target, administered rTMS to the same brain region multiple times and at different frequencies, or administered rTMS at more than one brain region to all participants. Twelve studies administered rTMS at multiple frequencies. We excluded five of these studies from analysis, as they employed a priming protocol of two frequencies at once, did not report side effects by treatment target, or administered more than one frequency to all participants.

Overall, the side effect profiles by rTMS target and stimulation protocol were similar to the overall comparisons of active vs sham rTMS (see Supplemental Tables 4–17). However, active rTMS to some targets was associated with a higher prevalence of specific side effects compared to sham (P < .05): temporal lobe/TPC: cognitive impairment; DLPFC: insomnia; cerebellar vermis: worsening mania; and VLPFC: fatigue. Likewise, some active stimulation protocols were associated with a higher prevalence of specific side effects compare to sham (P < .05): low frequency: cognitive impairment; iTBS: fatigue and worsening mania; and cTBS: neck pain.

### The effect of combined transcranial pulsed current stimulation and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation on lower limb spasticity in children with spastic cerebral palsy: a randomized and controlled clinical study [^c4b5892e]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Limitations of study

This study had important limitations that need to be discussed. First, we did not conduct any comparison with sham stimulation, so the placebo effect cannot be excluded. However, we believe that it was unlikely, because in the current study, the severe cognitive deficits of the participants made them blind to treatment condition for all intents and purposes. It was noted that participants in our study were mostly spastic quadriplegia categorized as levels GMFCS IV and V and were between 7 and 9 years old. Further, the severity of their clinical conditions had been present for many years and it would be rather inconceivable that placebo effects alone would have mediated the improvements in lower limb spasticity observed in the experimental group in a period of 12 weeks. The two doctors who were responsible for evaluating the impact of the procedures were also blinded to which participant belonged to the Experimental or control groups. Second, there was no active TENS-alone group (sham tPCS/active TENS) or tPCS-alone group (active tPCS/sham TENS). Therefore, we cannot rule out that the superior effects of the combination therapy of tPCS and TENS were just because of either tPCS or TENS alone. Although this alternative explanation needed to be considered, it was less likely, given that other NIBS-alone and TENS-alone studies have reported less positive results compared to our study in children with SCP who were less severe than our sample children. Third, due to limited resources, we did not evaluate changes using clinical diagnostic instruments such as EMG, TMS, FMRI or high-density EEG. Thus, we are unable to identify the exact contribution of each electrode or the interaction effects among them to the final positive outcome, and further studies would be needed to investigate this aspect. Finally, post-treatment evaluations were performed 3 days after the last session of treatment and not at any other timepoint. Therefore, we were not able to evaluate the longer-term effects of the combination therapy of tPCS and TENS.

### The effect of a single session of transcranial direct current stimulation on attention in pediatric acquired brain injury: characterizing interindividual structural and functional network response variability [^edeaecab]. Pediatric Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Approximately one in four children who sustain an acquired brain injury (ABI) have attention difficulties impacting education, employment, and community participation. These difficulties arise from dysfunction in attention-related brain networks, incentivizing the use of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). We investigated whether a single tDCS session improved attention following childhood ABI and whether baseline structural connectivity (sc), functional connectivity (fc), attention, and/or simulated electric fields (E-fields) explained variability in response.

Methods

In a randomized, single-blind, within-subject, sham-controlled trial, 15 children with ABI (mean 12.7 years) and 15 healthy controls (HCs) received three single tDCS sessions (1 mA dorsolateral prefrontal cortex [dlPFC], 1 mA inferior frontal gyrus [IFG], sham; 20 min) during gamified attention training. We examined postintervention changes in attention according to flanker and stop signal reaction time (RT). We used multimodal analyses (high-density electroencephalography [HD-EEG], diffusion tensor imaging, magnetic resonance imaging) to investigate interindividual variability in tDCS response, according to associations between RT change and baseline fc, sc, attention, and E-fields.

Results

Although no effect of active versus sham tDCS was found overall, participants with lower theta or higher gamma default mode network connectivity and poorer attention at baseline showed greater response to tDCS. Higher E-fields were associated with greater response. No serious adverse effects occurred.

Conclusions

A single tDCS session targeting dlPFC or IFG did not improve attention following pediatric ABI. We demonstrated how HD-EEG source-based connectivity may be used to personalize tDCS. Future research should explore whether personalization and/or repeated tDCS sessions can improve attention following pediatric ABI.

### Efficacy and safety of transcranial direct current stimulation for treating negative symptoms in schizophrenia: a randomized clinical trial [^0f20d9d1]. JAMA Psychiatry (2020). High credibility.

Importance

Negative symptoms represent a substantial burden in schizophrenia. Although preliminary studies have suggested that transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is effective for some clusters of symptoms, the clinical benefits for negative symptoms are unclear.

Objective

To determine the efficacy and safety of tDCS vs sham as an add-on treatment for patients with schizophrenia and predominant negative symptoms.

Design, Setting, and Participants

The double-blind Schizophrenia Treatment With Electric Transcranial Stimulation (STARTS) randomized clinical trial was conducted from September 2014 to March 2018 in 2 outpatient clinics in the state of São Paulo, Brazil. Patients with schizophrenia with stable negative and positive symptoms and a minimum score of 20 points in the negative symptoms subscale of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) were included.

Interventions

Ten sessions of tDCS performed twice a day for 5 days or a sham procedure. The anode and the cathode were positioned over the left prefrontal cortex and the left temporoparietal junction, respectively.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Change in the PANSS negative symptoms subscale score at week 6 was the primary outcome. Patients were followed-up for an additional 6 weeks.

Results

Of the 100 included patients, 20 (20.0%) were female, and the mean (SD) age was 35.3 (9.3) years. A total of 95 patients (95.0%) finished the trial. In the intention-to-treat analysis, patients receiving active tDCS showed a significantly greater improvement in PANSS score compared with those receiving the sham procedure (difference, 2.65; 95% CI, 1.51–3.79; number needed to treat, 3.18; 95% CI, 2.12–6.99; P < .001). Response rates for negative symptoms (20% improvement or greater) were also higher in the active group (20 of 50 [40%]) vs the sham group (2 of 50 [4%]) (P < .001). These effects persisted at follow-up. Transcranial direct current stimulation was well tolerated, and adverse effects did not differ between groups, except for burning sensation over the scalp in the active group (43.8%) vs the sham group (14.3%) (P = 0.003).

Conclusions and Relevance

Transcranial direct current stimulation was effective and safe in ameliorating negative symptoms in patients with schizophrenia.

### Efficacy and safety of deep transcranial magnetic stimulation for obsessive-compulsive disorder: a prospective multicenter randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial [^52b455e0]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a chronic and disabling condition that often responds unsatisfactorily to pharmacological and psychological treatments. Converging evidence suggests a dysfunction of the cortical-striatal-thalamic-cortical circuit in OCD, and a previous feasibility study indicated beneficial effects of deep transcranial magnetic stimulation (dTMS) targeting the medial prefrontal cortex and the anterior cingulate cortex. The authors examined the therapeutic effect of dTMS in a multicenter double-blind sham-controlled study.

Methods

At 11 centers, 99 OCD patients were randomly allocated to treatment with either high-frequency (20 Hz) or sham dTMS and received daily treatments following individualized symptom provocation, for 6 weeks. Clinical response to treatment was determined using the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (YBOCS), and the primary efficacy endpoint was the change in score from baseline to posttreatment assessment. Additional measures were response rates (defined as a reduction of ≥ 30% in YBOCS score) at the posttreatment assessment and after another month of follow-up.

Results

Eighty-nine percent of the active treatment group and 96% of the sham treatment group completed the study. The reduction in YBOCS score among patients who received active dTMS treatment was significantly greater than among patients who received sham treatment (reductions of 6.0 points and 3.3 points, respectively), with response rates of 38.1% and 11.1%, respectively. At the 1-month follow-up, the response rates were 45.2% in the active treatment group and 17.8% in the sham treatment group. Significant differences between the groups were maintained at follow-up.

Conclusions

High-frequency dTMS over the medial prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex significantly improved OCD symptoms and may be considered as a potential intervention for patients who do not respond adequately to pharmacological and psychological interventions.

### Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) combined with cognitive training in adolescent boys with ADHD: a double-blind, randomised, sham-controlled trial [^9cb90d92]. Psychological Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is characterised by persisting, age-inappropriate and impairing symptoms of inattention and/or impulsivity-hyperactivity (American Psychiatric Association). ADHD is also associated with deficits in executive functions (EF), most prominently in motor and interference inhibition, sustained attention and vigilance, switching, working memory and timing (Coghill, Toplak, Rhodes, & Adamo; Rubia). Neuroimaging studies indicate delayed structural and functional brain maturation (Shaw et al; Sripada, Kessler, & Angstadt,), and consistent underactivation in predominantly right inferior frontal (rIFC), dorsolateral prefrontal (dlPFC) and anterior cingulate cortices, as well as striatal, parietal and cerebellar regions during cognitive control, timing and attention tasks (Hart, Radua, Mataix-Cols, & Rubia; Lukito et al; Norman et al; Rubia).

Psychostimulants are the gold-standard treatment for improving ADHD symptoms, but have possible associated side effects (Cortese,), poor adherence in adolescence (Cortese et al; Cunill, Castells, Tobias, & Capellà,) and are not indicated for all individuals with ADHD (Faraone et al.). Evidence of longer-term efficacy is also limited (Cortese et al; Swanson et al.), possibly due to brain adaptation (Fusar-Poli, Rubia, Rossi, Sartori, & Balottin). Meta-analyses indicate small to moderate efficacy of behavioural therapies, cognitive training (CT), neurofeedback or dietary interventions on ADHD symptoms (Catalá-López et al.). Non-invasive brain stimulation techniques, however, are promising given their potential to stimulate key dysfunctional brain regions associated with ADHD, with potentially longer-term neuroplastic effects that drugs cannot offer (Cinel, Valeriani, & Poli; Rubia; Sierawska et al; STIPED Press Release; Westwood, Radua, & Rubia). Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is particularly well-suited for paediatric populations as it is user-friendly, well tolerated with minimal side effects (Bikson et al.), and is cheaper relative to other techniques, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (Gilbert).

### Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) combined with cognitive training in adolescent boys with ADHD: a double-blind, randomised, sham-controlled trial [^5c89f6f1]. Psychological Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) could be a side-effect-free alternative to psychostimulants in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Although there is limited evidence for clinical and cognitive effects, most studies were small, single-session and stimulated left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). No sham-controlled study has stimulated the right inferior frontal cortex (rIFC), which is the most consistently under-functioning region in ADHD, with multiple anodal-tDCS sessions combined with cognitive training (CT) to enhance effects. Thus, we investigated the clinical and cognitive effects of multi-session anodal-tDCS over rIFC combined with CT in double-blind, randomised, sham-controlled trial (RCT, ISRCTN48265228).

Methods

Fifty boys with ADHD (10–18 years) received 15 weekday sessions of anodal- or sham-tDCS over rIFC combined with CT (20 min, 1 mA). ANCOVA, adjusting for baseline measures, age and medication status, tested group differences in clinical and ADHD-relevant executive functions at posttreatment and after 6 months.

Results

ADHD-Rating Scale, Conners ADHD Index and adverse effects were significantly lower at post-treatment after sham relative to anodal tDCS. No other effects were significant.

Conclusions

This rigorous and largest RCT of tDCS in adolescent boys with ADHD found no evidence of improved ADHD symptoms or cognitive performance following multi-session anodal tDCS over rIFC combined with CT. These findings extend limited meta-analytic evidence of cognitive and clinical effects in ADHD after 1–5 tDCS sessions over mainly left dlPFC. Given that tDCS is commercially and clinically available, the findings are important as they suggest that rIFC stimulation may not be indicated as a neurotherapy for cognitive or clinical remediation for ADHD.

### Study details | Safety and efficacy of tDCS in pediatric DoC… [^3a6837b8]. ClinicalTrials (2023). Medium credibility.

In fact, although the method has been shown to be safe in other clinical conditions, efficacy and tolerability in children with DoC may vary significantly depending on differences in activation threshold and the presence of underlying pathological electrical activity The implementation of clinical trials investigating the safety and tolerability of tDCS in paediatric patients with DoC. now represents an essential first step for a future determination of the efficacy of this method in a population for which therapeutic options are currently extremely limited Objective: The study aim to verify the safety of tDCS treatment and to evaluate the effectiveness of stimulation of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex by tDCS in promoting improvement in the level of consciousness in paediatric patients with Disorders of Consciousness.

Method: in this mono-center, randomised, double blind cross-over controlled pilot study, real or sham tDCS were applied to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of paediatric patients with disorders of consciousness for two weeks, followed by two weeks of washout, then real or sham tDCS were applied to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex for other two weeks, followed by another two weeks of washout. Efficacy During the last 20 years, intervention studies with innovative non-invasive brain stimulation techniques, such as transcranial direct current stimulation, have shown that cycles of low-intensity electrical stimulation delivered via electrodes applied to the scalp in specific areas can promote the processes of neuronal plasticity, i.e. the ability of the central nervous system to modify its structure and functioning in response to new information and experiences.

These effects appear to be particularly interesting in the treatment of various neurological and psychiatric disorders such as Parkinson's Disease, post-stroke aphasia or the neuropsychological outcomes of Multiple Sclerosis. More recently, tDCS has been shown to be a safe, inexpensive, and simple technique that can be easily integrated into rehabilitation programs. In particular, stimulation with tDCS has been shown to be effective in aiding the recovery of the state of consciousness in the adult population in the acute, subacute and chronic phase, predominantly in the MCS condition, considering traumatic and non-traumatic etiology. This occurs especially in the anodic stimulation mode of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.

In a study in which tDCS was applied for five consecutive days on the motor cortex and left prefrontal cortex in 10 chronic DoC patients, the effect of stimulation was evaluated up to 12 months after its ending, showing that even chronic DoC patients show signs of improvement and that this effect can be maintained up to 12 months after tDCS treatment. From a neurophysiological point of view, tDCS acts by increasing neuronal excitability and facilitating the action potential by modifying the excitability of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors. In addition, tDCS can enhance active synaptic connections. The effect of a single tDCS session lasts approximately 60 to 90 minutes; when stimulation is repeated 10 times up to 20 sessions it has been found that the effects last up to 3 months after the ending of the stimulation sessions. Security The safety and tolerability of tDCS have been widely demonstrated in adult patients with consciousness disorders and brain damage.

### Feasibility, acceptability and practicality of transcranial stimulation in obsessive compulsive symptoms (FEATSOCS): a randomised controlled crossover trial [^5e9aa82c]. Comprehensive Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive form of neurostimulation with potential for development as a self-administered intervention. It has shown promise as a safe and effective treatment for obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) in a small number of studies. The two most favourable stimulation targets appear to be the left orbitofrontal cortex (L-OFC) and the supplementary motor area (SMA). We report the first study to test these targets head-to-head within a randomised sham-controlled trial. Our aim was to inform the design of future clinical research studies, by focussing on the acceptability and safety of the intervention, feasibility of recruitment, adherence to and tolerability of tDCS, and the size of any treatment-effect.

Methods

FEATSOCS was a randomised, double-blind, sham-controlled, cross-over, multicentre study. Twenty adults with DSM-5-defined OCD were randomised to treatment, comprising three courses of clinic-based tDCS (SMA, L-OFC, Sham), randomly allocated and delivered in counterbalanced order. Each course comprised four 20-min 2 mA stimulations, delivered over two consecutive days, separated by a 'washout' period of at least four weeks. Assessments were carried out by raters who were blind to stimulation-type. Clinical outcomes were assessed before, during, and up to four weeks after stimulation. Patient representatives with lived experience of OCD were actively involved at all stages.

Results

Clinicians showed willingness to recruit participants and recruitment to target was achieved. Adherence to treatment and study interventions was generally good, with only two dropouts. There were no serious adverse events, and adverse effects which did occur were transient and mostly mild in intensity. Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) scores were numerically improved from baseline to 24 h after the final stimulation across all intervention groups but tended to worsen thereafter. The greatest effect size was seen in the L-OFC arm, (Cohen's d = -0.5 [95% CI -1.2 to 0.2] versus Sham), suggesting this stimulation site should be pursued in further studies. Additional significant sham referenced improvements in secondary outcomes occurred in the L-OFC arm, and to a lesser extent with SMA stimulation.

Conclusions

tDCS was acceptable, practicable to apply, well-tolerated and appears a promising potential treatment for OCD. The L-OFC represents the most promising target based on clinical changes, though the effects on OCD symptoms were not statistically significant compared to sham. SMA stimulation showed lesser signs of promise. Further investigation of tDCS in OCD is warranted, to determine the optimal stimulation protocol (current, frequency, duration), longer-term effectiveness and brain-based mechanisms of effect. If efficacy is substantiated, consideration of home-based approaches represents a rational next step.

### Multisession tDCS combined with intrastimulation training improves emotion recognition in adolescents with autism spectrum disorder [^d09956b2]. Neurotherapeutics (2024). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, this double-blind, randomized controlled trial was conducted to investigate the effects and underlying neurophysiological mechanisms of multisession 2 ​mA tDCS with left dlPFC anode placement and right supraorbital region cathode placement delivered with concurrent computerized social cognition training in 12–18-year-old individuals with ASD. The results indicate that our protocol was a safe, feasible, and well-tolerated treatment for male adolescents with ASD and that it could promote their emotion recognition ability depending on task characteristics. We propose that in our study endogenous (social cognition training) and exogenous (anodal tDCS) modulation of the mPFC activity and associated networks interacted synergistically to elicit behavioral improvement. Future trials investigating the implications and parameters of intrastimulation trainings and applying individualized stimulation dosage would be beneficial to expand our understanding of the neurophysiological mechanisms of tDCS-induced changes in ASD.

### Direct current stimulation modulates prefrontal cell activity and behaviour without inducing seizure-like firing [^2d322a2b]. Brain (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has garnered significant interest for its potential to enhance cognitive functions and as a therapeutic intervention in various cognitive disorders. However, the clinical application of tDCS has been hampered by significant variability in its cognitive outcomes. Furthermore, the widespread use of tDCS has raised concerns regarding its safety and efficacy, particularly in light of our limited understanding of its underlying neural mechanisms at the cellular level. We still do not know 'where', 'when' and 'how' tDCS modulates information encoding by neurons, in order to lead to the observed changes in cognitive functions. Without elucidating these fundamental unknowns, the root causes of its outcome variability and long-term safety remain elusive, challenging the effective application of tDCS in clinical settings.

Addressing this gap, our study investigates the effects of tDCS, applied over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, on cognitive abilities and individual neuron activity in macaque monkeys performing cognitive tasks. Like humans performing a delayed match-to-sample task, monkeys exhibited practice-related slowing in their responses (within-session behavioural adaptation). Concurrently, there were practice-related changes in simultaneously recorded activity of prefrontal neurons (within-session neuronal adaptation).

Anodal tDCS attenuated both these behavioural and neuronal adaptations when compared with sham stimulation. Furthermore, tDCS abolished the correlation between response time of monkeys and neuronal firing rate. At a single-cell level, we also found that following tDCS, neuronal firing rate was more likely to exhibit task-specific modulation than after sham stimulation. These tDCS-induced changes in both behaviour and neuronal activity persisted even after the end of tDCS stimulation. Importantly, multiple applications of tDCS did not alter burst-like firing rates of individual neurons when compared with sham stimulation. This suggests that tDCS modulates neural activity without enhancing susceptibility to epileptiform activity, confirming a potential for safe use in clinical settings.

Our research contributes unprecedented insights into the 'where', 'when' and 'how' of tDCS effects on neuronal activity and cognitive functions by showing that modulation of the behaviour of monkeys by the tDCS of the prefrontal cortex is accompanied by alterations in prefrontal cortical cell activity ('where') during distinct trial phases ('when'). Importantly, tDCS led to task-specific and state-dependent alterations in prefrontal cell activities ('how'). Our findings suggest a significant shift from the view that the effects of tDCS are merely attributable to polarity-specific shifts in cortical excitability and instead propose a more complex mechanism of action for tDCS that encompasses various aspects of cortical neuronal activity without increasing burst-like epileptiform susceptibility.

### Cerebellar transcranial direct current stimulation in spinocerebellar ataxia type 3: a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled trial [^8491ea22]. Neurotherapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

Repeated sessions of cerebellar anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) have been suggested to modulate cerebellar-motor cortex (M1) connectivity and decrease ataxia severity. However, therapeutic trials involving etiologically homogeneous groups of ataxia patients are lacking. The objective of this study was to investigate if a two-week regimen of daily cerebellar tDCS sessions diminishes ataxia and non-motor symptom severity and alters cerebellar-M1 connectivity in individuals with spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3). We conducted a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled trial in which twenty mildly to moderately affected SCA3 patients received ten sessions of real or sham cerebellar tDCS (i.e. five days per week for two consecutive weeks). Effects were evaluated after two weeks, three months, six months, and twelve months. Change in Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) score after two weeks was defined as the primary endpoint. Static posturography, SCA Functional Index tests, various patient-reported outcome measures, the cerebellar cognitive affective syndrome scale, and paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation to examine cerebellar brain inhibition (CBI) served as secondary endpoints. Absolute change in SARA score did not differ between both trial arms at any of the time points. We observed significant short-term improvements in several motor, cognitive, and patient-reported outcomes after the last stimulation session in both groups but no treatment effects in favor of real tDCS. Nonetheless, some of the patients in the intervention arm showed a sustained reduction in SARA score lasting six or even twelve months, indicating interindividual variability in treatment response. CBI, which reflects the functional integrity of the cerebellothalamocortical tract, remained unchanged after ten tDCS sessions. Albeit exploratory, there was some indication for between-group differences in SARA speech score after six and twelve months and in the number of extracerebellar signs after three and six months. Taken together, our study does not provide evidence that a two-week treatment with daily cerebellar tDCS sessions reduces ataxia severity or restores cerebellar-M1 connectivity in early-to-middle-stage SCA3 patients at the group level. In order to potentially increase therapeutic efficacy, further research is warranted to identify individual predictors of symptomatic improvement.

Neuromodulation/neurostimulation — repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) for tinnitus management: There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) for tinnitus management (Neither for nor against | Reviewed, New-added). Protocols described include left prefrontal stimulation for major depression with 10 or 20 pulses per second and daily sessions over the course of 4–6 weeks, whereas tinnitus protocols have delivered 1 pulse per second to the temporal region, with daily sessions over the course of 5–30 days or more, and more recent tinnitus studies used prefrontal 10 or 20 pulses per second sometimes followed by lower frequency stimulation (1 pulse per second, or 1 Hz) to the temporal region. An SR of 28 studies (n = 947) reported stimulation rates from 1–50 Hz with study sample sizes ranging from 4–146, concluding that active rTMS, as compared with sham (or placebo), was an effective treatment for tinnitus and that temporal region stimulation was more effective than frontal lobe stimulation.

### Effectiveness and safety of adjunctive transcranial direct current stimulation for adolescents with first-episode major depressive disorder: a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled trial [^59515c59]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2026). Medium credibility.

Background

Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a non-invasive brain stimulation method, can improve depressive symptoms by applying weak electric direct currents to the scalp. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of adjunctive tDCS for adolescents with first-episode major depressive disorder (FE-MDD).

Methods

This double-blind, randomized, sham-controlled trial (RCT) was conducted between January 3, 2024, and August 24, 2024. Adolescents (aged 13–17 years) with FE-MDD were included and randomly allocated to active tDCS group or sham tDCS group. Patients completed 10 sessions of active tDCS or sham tDCS, 1 session per day on weekdays for 2 weeks. The main outcome was the change score in the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) from baseline to the last session of tDCS. Secondary outcomes included response rate, remission rate, and changes in neurocognitive function, with the latter assessed by the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery. Clinical response was defined as a ≥ 50% reduction in the MADRS score from baseline to the 10th tDCS session. Clinical remission was defined as MADRS scores equal to or less than 10 at the 10th tDCS session.

Results

Twenty patients in the active tDCS group and 20 patients in the sham tDCS group were included in the Intention-To-Treat analysis. A linear mixed model adjusting for baseline MADRS scores and daily chlorpromazine equivalents revealed no significant interactions between time and tDCS condition in MADRS scores (F 3,114 = 0.65; p = 0.59). Rates of response (14 of 20 patients [70%; 95% CI, 50%-90%] versus 9 of 20 patients [45%; 95% CI, 25%-65%]; χ² = 2.56; p = 0.11) and remission (11 of 20 participants in the active tDCS group [55%; 95% CI, 35%-75%] versus 10 of 20 participants in the sham tDCS group [50%, 95% CI, 30%-70%]; χ² = 0.10; p = 0.75) were higher in the active tDCS group than in the sham tDCS group, though these group differences were not statistically significant. However, statistically significant group by time interactions were observed in cognitive domains of working memory (F 1,38 = 4.14; p = 0.049) as well as verbal learning and memory (F 1,38 = 8.22; p = 0.01). No serious adverse effects were observed in either group. The active tDCS group (versus the sham tDSC group) had significantly more post-tDCS headaches (85% [95% CI, 65%-100%] vs. 50% [95% CI, 30%-70%]; χ² = 5.58; p = 0.02), but other side effects (e.g., dizziness, diarrhea) did not differ significantly between the two study groups.

Conclusions

Findings of this RCT suggest that active tDCS is safe for adolescents with FE-MDD. Although no statistically significant difference between groups over time was observed in the primary efficacy outcome, patients in the active tDCS group did have a greater proportion of remission and response. Furthermore, active tDCS was associated with comparatively stronger improvements in working memory as well as verbal learning and memory when compared to sham tDCS.

### Transcranial direct current stimulation in autism spectrum disorder… [^5639f007]. ClinicalTrials (2019). Medium credibility.

Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation in Autism Spectrum DisorderClinicalTrials. gov ID Study Overview Background: Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation is a form of non-invasive brain stimulation that has aroused increased interests in the past decade. Not only that it is transient with little side-effects, and can be well-tolerated by children, it is also affordable and readily accessible, making it an appealing treatment option for autism spectrum disorder. Objective: To assess the therapeutic effects of tDCS when combined with cognitive training for 10 consecutive weekdays on improving cognitive processing in adolescents with ASD, relative to control group receiving sham-stimulation, and to evaluate the associated neural mechanisms underlying the treatment effect of tDCS on adolescents with ASD. Methods: 105 adolescents with ASD will be randomly assigned to active-, sham- tDCS, or no-treatment control groups.

Twenty minute sessions of 1 mA cathodal stimulation to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in conjunction with cognitive training exercise will be provided on 10 consecutive weekdays. EEGs, functional near-infrared spectroscopy, and neuropsychological tests will be administered before, 1 day and 6 months after the series of tDCS sessions. Hypothesis: We hypothesized that cathodal tDCS over the left DLPRC will induce stimulation-linked facilitation of learning and enhanced processing speed and resultant improvement of cognitive functioning, in executive function, relative to the sham-tDCS and the wait-list controls, active-tDCS, but not sham-tDCS and wait-list controls, will modulate the intra- and inter-hemispheric neural connectivity, indexed by altered level EEG theta coherence and aberrant fNIRS haemodynamic measures, across brain areas implicated in executive functioning.

Thus far, there is no cure for ASD and the disorder remains a highly disabling condition in spite of the existing treatment options. Hence, more effective novel therapeutic approaches are urgently needed. In the past 10 years, transcranial direct current stimulation, a brain stimulation technique, has been intensively investigated regarding its physiologic mechanisms of action render empirical support of its application in clinical setting. As a result, these individuals compensate for the impaired ability to integrate information from the environment by memorizing visual details or individual rules from each situation. This explains why individuals with the disorder tend to follow routines in precise details and show great distress with trivial changes in the environment. One emerging principle is that the cognitive deficits in autism are caused by excessively high level of excitation within the neural circuits that mediate the different cognitive functions in ASD.

The suggested role of the increased ratio of cortical cellular excitation to inhibition in the pathophysiology of of ASD is supported by recent studies which have shown that a reduction in GABAergic signalling is a common feature in the brains of autistic individuals, with enhancement of excitatory glutamatergic signalling as the underlying mechanism. These findings are consistent with neural connectivity studies suggesting that cortical cellular E/I imbalance or hyper-excitability could disrupt the normal progressive differentiation and elaboration of functional connectivity in the developing brain. Effects of Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation on modulating cortical excitation/inhibition balance: tDCS is a non-invasive neuromodulation method which influences cortical activity level, by applying low direct currents to the scalp through anodal and cathodal electrodes.

### Translational neuroscience in autism: from neuropathology to transcranial magnetic stimulation therapies [^c54fec74]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

The presence of heterotopias, increased regional density of neurons at the gray-white matter junction, and focal cortical dysplasias all suggest an abnormality of neuronal migration in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The abnormality is borne from a dissonance in timing between radial and tangentially migrating neuroblasts to the developing cortical plate. The uncoupling of excitatory and inhibitory cortical cells disturbs the coordinated interactions of neurons within local networks, thus providing abnormal patterns of brainwave activity in the gamma bandwidth. In ASD, gamma oscillation abnormalities and autonomic markers offer measures of therapeutic progress and help in the identification of subgroups.

### Remotely monitored transcranial direct current stimulation in pediatric cerebral palsy: open label trial protocol [^b28520ae]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Pediatric applications of non-invasive brain stimulation using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) have demonstrated its safety with few adverse events reported. Remotely monitored tDCS, as an adjuvant intervention to rehabilitation, may improve quality of life for children with cerebral palsy (CP) through motor function improvements, reduced treatment costs, and increased access to tDCS therapies. Our group previously evaluated the feasibility of a remotely monitored mock tDCS setup in which families and children successfully demonstrated the ability to follow tDCS instructional guidance.

Methods and Design

Here, we designed a protocol to investigate the feasibility, safety, and tolerability of at-home active transcranial direct current stimulation in children with CP with synchronous supervision from laboratory investigators. Ten participants will be recruited to participate in the study for 5 consecutive days with the following sessions: tDCS setup practice on day 1, sham tDCS on day 2, and active tDCS on days 3–5. Sham stimulation will consist of an initial 30-second ramp up to 1.5 mA stimulation followed by a 30-second ramp down. Active stimulation will be delivered at 1.0–1.5 mA for 20 minutes and adjusted based on child tolerance. Feasibility will be evaluated via photographs of montage setup and the quality of stimulation delivery. Safety and tolerability will be assessed through an adverse events survey, the Box and Blocks Test (BBT) motor assessment, and a setup ease/comfort survey.

Discussion

We expect synchronous supervision of at-home teleneuromodulation to be tolerable and safe with increasing stimulation quality over repeated sessions when following a tDCS setup previously determined to be feasible. The findings will provide opportunity for larger clinical trials exploring efficacy and illuminate the potential of remotely monitored tDCS in combination with rehabilitation interventions as a means of pediatric neurorehabilitation. This will demonstrate the value of greater accessibility of non-invasive brain stimulation interventions and ultimately offer the potential to improve care and quality of life for children and families with CP.

### Behavioral outcomes after tDCS treatment during immediate post-intervention and follow-up periods in children and adolescents diagnosed with attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder: a systematic review and meta-analysis on randomized sham-controlled trials [^80b473e4]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2025). Medium credibility.

This meta-analysis aimed at elucidating the effectiveness of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in improving behavioral symptoms of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children/adolescents during the immediate post-intervention/follow-up periods and identifying potential confounders. Randomized placebo-controlled trials (RCTs) were retrieved from major databases using the main keywords "tDCS" and "ADHD". The outcomes of interest were quantified using effect size expressed as standardized mean difference (SMD) for continuous variables with 95% confidence interval (CI). Meta-analysis of five RCTs (158 participants, mean age = 13) revealed greater improvement in impulsivity symptoms during follow-ups (SMD = -0.48, 95% CI: -0.88 to -0.09, p = 0.02) but not immediately after treatment (p = 0.61) in the tDCS group than in sham-controls without significant improvements in the total and behavioral symptoms of inattention/hyperactivity both immediately post-treatment (p = 0.61, p = 0.81, and p = 0.81, respectively) and during follow-ups (p = 0.28, p = 0.24, and p = 0.14, respectively). Subgroup comparison between trials locating the anode over the left prefrontal cortex (PFC) and those on the right PFC showed therapeutic effect of the former on impulsivity symptoms during follow-ups (SMD = -0.76 vs. -0.06, p = 0.04). In summary, our results did not support effectiveness of tDCS in alleviating symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity immediately after treatment and during follow-ups. Our study only showed tDCS-associated impulsivity improvement in children/adolescents with ADHD during follow-ups and anode placement on the left PFC. Nevertheless, the relatively short treatment periods may obscure the therapeutic benefit immediately after tDCS. Despite implications for designing optimal treatment protocols, our findings based on a limited number of available trials warrant further verification from large-scale clinical investigations.

### Randomised controlled trial comparing different intersession intervals of intermittent theta burst delivered to the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex [^57b6ef6f]. BMJ Mental Health (2024). High credibility.

Abstract

Background

Intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) is a form of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) that can be administered in a fraction of the time of standard rTMS. Applying multiple daily iTBS sessions (ie, accelerated iTBS) may enable patients to achieve remission more rapidly. However, questions remain regarding the optimal time interval between treatment sessions.

Objective

The overall aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and tolerability of two accelerated bilateral iTBS protocols (ie, 30-min or 60-min intervals) and a once-daily bilateral iTBS protocol (ie, 0-min interval) while the number of pulses was held constant, in patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD).

Methods

182 patients with TRD were randomised to receive two sessions per day of bilateral iTBS of the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC) at 60-min, 30-min or 0-min intervals. Sham treatments were delivered using a shielded 'sham coil' which produced the auditory and tactile sensations of stimulation. The primary outcome measure was a change in depression scores on the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD-17) after 20 days of treatment.

Results

HRSD-17 scores improved across all groups; however, these improvements did not significantly differ between the three groups after 20 days of treatment. Similarly, response and remission rates did not differ between the treatment groups.

Conclusions

These results suggest that contrary to our original hypothesis, implementing a 30-min or 60-min interval between two treatment sessions of DMPFC-iTBS does not lead to a more rapid improvement in symptoms, than once-daily iTBS administration.

### Transcranial direct current stimulation targeting the medial prefrontal cortex modulates functional connectivity and enhances safety learning in obsessive-compulsive disorder: results from two pilot studies [^695d1dc9]. Depression and Anxiety (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Exposed-based psychotherapy is a mainstay of treatment for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and anxious psychopathology. The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and the default mode network (DMN), which is anchored by the mPFC, promote safety learning. Neuromodulation targeting the mPFC might augment therapeutic safety learning and enhance response to exposure-based therapies.

Methods

To characterize the effects of mPFC neuromodulation on functional connectivity, 17 community volunteers completed resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging scans before and after 20min of frontopolar anodal multifocal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). To examine the effects of tDCS on therapeutic safety learning, 24 patients with OCD completed a pilot randomized clinical trial; they were randomly assigned (double-blind, 50:50) to receive active or sham frontopolar tDCS before completing an in vivo exposure and response prevention (ERP) challenge. Changes in subjective emotional distress during the ERP challenge were used to index therapeutic safety learning.

Results

In community volunteers, frontal pole functional connectivity with the middle and superior frontal gyri increased, while connectivity with the anterior insula and basal ganglia decreased (ps < .001, corrected) after tDCS; functional connectivity between DMN and salience network also decreased after tDCS (ps < .001, corrected). OCD patients who received active tDCS exhibited more rapid therapeutic safety learning (ps < .05) during the ERP challenge than patients who received sham tDCS.

Conclusions

Frontopolar tDCS may modulate mPFC and DMN functional connectivity and can accelerate therapeutic safety learning. Though limited by small samples, these findings motivate further exploration of the effects of frontopolar tDCS on neural and behavioral targets associated with exposure-based psychotherapies.

### Efficacy of transcranial direct current stimulation on seizure control in patients with refractory epilepsy: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^3e3d2c62]. Neurosurgical Review (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) represents a major challenge affecting more than 30% of all patients with epilepsy. Surgical management of DRE proved to be effective in both children and adults. However, its efficacy is limited in cases of diffuse, multifocal, or inaccessible epileptogenic foci. Moreover, the high failure rate of surgery mandates the shift to other treatment options. Moreover, invasive stimulation techniques such as vagus nerve stimulation (VNS), anterior thalamic deep brain stimulation (DBS), and responsive neurostimulation (RNS) possessed several adverse events such as infection, hematoma at the location of the implant, as well as hoarseness, coughing, and paresthesia. Those adverse events besides the invasive nature of the techniques mandate the shift to non-invasive techniques due to their simplicity, safety, tolerability, and reversibility. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is one example with higher safety and lower cost compared to other non-invasive neuro-stimulation techniques such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation.

The tDCS involves the application of an electric current of low intensity to the scalp causing subthreshold modulation of the membrane potential leading to depolarization (anodal tDCS) or hyperpolarization (cathodal tDCS) depending on the direction of stimulation. Multiple preclinical trials have shown that tDCS can modulate cortical excitability and significantly raise the seizure threshold in epileptic rodent models which paved the way for the first clinical trial in 2006 by Fregni et al. on 19 patients with epilepsy using one session (20 min) of cathodal tDCS that resulted in a significant decrease in seizure frequency. Similarly, a few years later, a significant reduction in epileptiform discharge was observed by Auvichayapat et al. after a single tDCS session on 29 epileptic children. However, the effect of this single-session protocol on seizure reduction was observed only immediately following the session, with no sustained effect over a longer period. Subsequent clinical trials that adopted a multiple tDCS session protocol revealed a more prolonged seizure control These discrepancies in results raised the need for a thorough meta-analysis to bring results together and give a better idea of the overall impact.

### Home-use transcranial direct current stimulation for the treatment of a major depressive episode: a randomized clinical trial [^73626558]. JAMA Psychiatry (2024). High credibility.

The study PSYLECT (tDCS only vs. double sham) was published by Lucas Borrione and colleagues in 2024 in the journal JAMA Psychiatry. This study is related to the following diseases: Major depressive disorder. In the PSYLECT (tDCS only vs. double sham) study, the trial question was: what is the role of home-use transcranial direct current stimulation in patients with major depressive episode? In the PSYLECT (tDCS only vs. double sham) study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the PSYLECT (tDCS only vs. double sham) study, the population was: 146 patients (126 female, 20 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients, aged 18–59 years, with a diagnosis of major depression and on an acute depressive episode of at least moderate severity. The key exclusion criteria were neurologic or clinical disorders; other psychiatric disorders except for anxiety; and contraindications to transcranial direct current stimulation. In the PSYLECT (tDCS only vs. double sham) study, the interventions were: n = 73 tDCS only (home-use transcranial direct current stimulation administered in 2-mA, 30 minute prefrontal sessions for 15 consecutive weekdays and twice-weekly sessions for 3 weeks) n = 73 double sham (sham home-use transcranial direct current stimulation of 1-mA, 90 second duration plus internet browsing). In the PSYLECT (tDCS only vs. double sham) study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in reduction in Hamilton Depression Rating Scale 17-item version score at week 6 (8.5 points vs. 7.7 points; AD 0.8 points, 95% CI -0.86 to 2.46). In the PSYLECT (tDCS only vs. double sham) study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in clinical response at week 6 (36% vs. 38%; OR 0.89, 95% CI -3.92 to 5.7) No significant difference in remission at week 6 (18% vs. 21%; OR 0.84, 95% CI -2.87 to 4.55). In the PSYLECT (tDCS only vs. double sham) study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in adverse events. In the PSYLECT (tDCS only vs. double sham) study, the conclusion was: in adult patients, aged 18–59 years, with a diagnosis of major depression and on an acute depressive episode of at least moderate severity, tDCS only was not superior to double sham with respect to reduction in Hamilton Depression Rating Scale 17-item version score at week 6.

### The effect of combined transcranial pulsed current stimulation and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation on lower limb spasticity in children with spastic cerebral palsy: a randomized and controlled clinical study [^9d328be6]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Fig. 2
Position of surface gel electrodes during combined tPCS and TENS stimulation. TENS transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation; tPCS transcranial pulsed current stimulation

The output parameters of TPCS were as follows:

tPCS (first electrode pair) intensity: 1 mA
TENS (second to sixth electrode pairs) intensity: 0–10 mA
Pulse width of current (all electrodes): 140 μs
Frequency (all electrodes): 400 Hz
Waveform (all electrodes): monophasic unidirectional square pulse

Assessment

Evaluations were conducted on 63 subjects by two qualified rehabilitation doctors who have been involved in clinical pediatric rehabilitation for more than 5 years. The evaluators were blinded to the study condition of the two groups and did not participate in the treatment of the subjects. Evaluations consisted of Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) and Modified Tardieu Scale (MTS) as primary outcome measures. Pre-treatment evaluation was done 3 days before first treatment and post-treatment evaluation was done 3 days after the last session of treatment. Both pre- and post-evaluations were conducted in a designated evaluation room that was spacious, quiet, and bright. Each scale was repeatedly measured three times during each evaluation. Each score was the mean of the three measurements.

MAS evaluation

The MAS was used to evaluate muscle spasticity in the lower limbs. MAS evaluation involves the rater manually moving a limb through the range of motion to passively stretch specific muscle groups and a six-point ordinal scale for grading the resistance encountered during such passive muscle stretching. MAS grades of spasticity are as follows: 0 = normal muscle tone; 1 = slight increase in muscle tone, manifested by catch and release or by minimal resistance at the end; 1+ = slight increase in muscle tone, manifested by a catch, followed by minimal resistance throughout; 2 = more marked increase in muscle tone, but limb easily flexed; 3 = considerable increase in muscle tone, passive movement difficult; and 4 = limb rigid in flexion or extension.

### Synergistic effect of combined transcranial direct current stimulation / constraint-induced movement therapy in children and young adults with hemiparesis: study protocol [^1905733b]. BMC Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Perinatal stroke occurs in more than 1 in 2,500 live births and resultant congenital hemiparesis necessitates investigation into interventions which may improve long-term function and decreased burden of care beyond current therapies. Constraint-Induced Movement Therapy (CIMT) is recognized as an effective hemiparesis rehabilitation intervention. Transcranial direct current stimulation as an adjunct treatment to CIMT may potentiate neuroplastic responses and improve motor function. The methodology of a clinical trial in children designed as a placebo-controlled, serial –session, non-invasive brain stimulation trial incorporating CIMT is described here. The primary hypotheses are 1) that no serious adverse events will occur in children receiving non-invasive brain stimulation and 2) that children in the stimulation intervention group will show significant improvements in hand motor function compared to children in the placebo stimulation control group.

Methods/design

A randomized, controlled, double-blinded clinical trial. Twenty children and/or young adults (ages 8–21) with congenital hemiparesis, will be enrolled. The intervention group will receive ten 2-hour sessions of transcranial direct current stimulation combined with constraint-induced movement therapy and the control group will receive sham stimulation with CIMT. The primary outcome measure is safety assessment of transcranial direct current stimulation by physician evaluation, vital sign monitoring and symptom reports. Additionally, hand function will be evaluated using the Assisting Hand Assessment, grip strength and assessment of goals using the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure. Neuroimaging will confirm diagnoses, corticospinal tract integrity and cortical activation. Motor cortical excitability will also be examined using transcranial magnetic stimulation techniques.

Discussion

Combining non-invasive brain stimulation and CIMT interventions has the potential to improve motor function in children with congenital hemiparesis beyond each intervention independently. Such a combined intervention has the potential to benefit an individual throughout their lifetime.

### Adverse event monitoring and reporting in pediatric neuromodulatory studies: a systematic review [^a9fd5a00]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Neuromodulatory interventions are relatively novel and approaches to studying harms and tolerability have varied. Using a checklist based on guidelines from Good Clinical Practice and the Harms Extension of the CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) Statement, we identified how adverse events are measured, assessed, and reported in studies evaluating neuromodulation for the treatment of mental and neurodevelopmental disorders among children and adolescents. A systematic literature review identified 56 experimental and quasi-experimental studies evaluating transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), transcranial alternating (tACS) or direct (tDCS) current stimulation, transcranial pulse stimulation (TPS), and vagus or trigeminal nerve stimulation (VNS or TNS). For 22 studies (39%), the types of adverse events to be monitored were identified, and for 31 studies (55%), methods for collecting adverse event data were described. Methods for assessing adverse events were less commonly described with 23 studies (41%) having details on assessing event severity, and 11 studies (20%) having details on assessing event causality. Among 31 studies with reported results, headache, skin irritation, and general pain or discomfort were the most reported across studies. Seizure, untoward medical occurrences, and intracranial bleeding, edema, or other intracranial pathology were considered serious events, but these events were not reported as occurring in any results-based papers. Taken together, the findings from this review indicate that most studies of pediatric neuromodulatory interventions did not include descriptions of adverse event monitoring and evaluation. Comprehensive event monitoring and reporting across studies can significantly augment the current knowledge base.

### Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation as a treatment for Alzheimer's disease: a randomized placebo-controlled double-blind clinical trial [^5f0cbf1a]. Neurotherapeutics (2024). Medium credibility.

We report results of a large multisite double-blind randomized trial investigating the short and long-term efficacy of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) applied to patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) at mild to moderate stages, in doses of either 2 or 4 weeks of treatment (5 days/week), whilst compared with 4 weeks of sham rTMS. Randomization to treatment group was stratified based on age and severity. The objectives of this study were to: 1) investigate the efficacy of active rTMS versus sham, 2) investigate the effect of dose of treatment (2 or 4 weeks), and 3) investigate the length of benefits from treatment. The rTMS pulses (20 ​Hz, 30 pulses/train, 25 trains, 10-s intertrain interval) were applied serially to the left and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex using neuro-navigation. We compared the primary outcome measure's (ADAS-Cog) score changes from pre- to post-treatment, with assessments at baseline and 4 more times up to 6 months post-treatment. Data of 135 patients were analyzed. The mean total ADAS-Cog score at baseline did not differ between the active and sham treatment groups, nor across the three study sites. The overall results show significant cognitive improvement after treatment up to two months post-treatment with either sham or active coils. The results show both short and long-term benefits of active rTMS treatment but also show similar benefits for sham coil treatment of mild/moderate AD. We discuss this finding in the context of the existing literature on rTMS therapy for AD, as well as evidence of the sham coil's potential to induce a low-level current in the brain.

### Association of central noninvasive brain stimulation interventions with efficacy and safety in tinnitus management: a meta-analysis [^29685a10]. JAMA Otolaryngology — Head & Neck Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Importance

Tinnitus has a prevalence of 10% to 25% and is frequently associated with numerous complications, such as neuropsychiatric disease. Traditional treatments have failed to meet the needs of patients with tinnitus. Noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS) can focally modify cortical functioning and has been proposed as a strategy for reducing tinnitus severity. However, the results have been inconclusive.

Objective

To evaluate the association between different central NIBS therapies and efficacy and acceptability for treatment of tinnitus.

Data Sources

ClinicalKey, Cochrane CENTRAL, Embase, ProQuest, PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Web of Science databases were searched from inception to August 4, 2019. No language restriction was applied. Manual searches were performed for potentially eligible articles selected from the reference lists of review articles and pairwise meta-analyses.

Study Selection

Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) examining the central NIBS method used in patients with unilateral or bilateral tinnitus were included in the current network meta-analysis. The central NIBS method was compared with sham, waiting list, or active controls. Studies that were not clinical trials or RCTs and did not report the outcome of interest were excluded.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Two authors independently screened the studies, extracted the relevant information, and evaluated the risk of bias in the included studies. In cases of discrepancy, a third author became involved. If manuscript data were not available, the corresponding authors or coauthors were approached to obtain the original data. This network meta-analysis was based on the frequentist model.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was change in the severity of tinnitus. Secondary outcomes were changes in quality of life and the response rate related to the NIBS method in patients with tinnitus.

Results

Overall, 32 unique RCTs were included with 1458 unique participants (mean female proportion, 34.4% [range, 0%-81.2%]; mean age, 49.6 [range, 40.0–62.8] years; median age, 49.8 [interquartile range, 48.1–52.4] years). The results of the network meta-analysis revealed that cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex combined with transcranial random noise stimulation over the bilateral auditory cortex was associated with the greatest improvement in tinnitus severity (standardized mean difference [SMD], -1.89; 95% CI, -3.00 to -0.78) and quality of life (SMD, -1.24; 95% CI, -2.02 to -0.45) compared with the controls. Improvement in tinnitus severity ranked more favorably for continuous theta-burst stimulation (cTBS) over both auditory cortices (SMD, -0.79; 95% CI = -1.57 to -0.01) than cTBS over only the left auditory cortex (SMD, -0.30; 95% CI, -0.87 to 0.28), compared with controls. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation with priming had a superior beneficial association with tinnitus severity compared with the strategies without priming. None of the investigated NIBS types had a significantly different dropout rate compared with that of the control group.

Conclusions and Relevance

This network meta-analysis suggests a potential role of NIBS interventions in tinnitus management. Future large-scale RCTs focusing on longer follow-up and different priming procedure NIBS are warranted to confirm these findings.

The primary hypotheses are 1) that no serious adverse events will occur in children receiving non-invasive brain stimulation and 2) that children in the stimulation intervention group will show significant improvements in hand motor function compared to children in the placebo stimulation control group.

Methods/Design

A randomized, controlled, double-blinded clinical trial. Twenty children and/or young adults (ages 8–21) with congenital hemiparesis, will be enrolled. The intervention group will receive ten 2-hour sessions of transcranial direct current stimulation combined with constraint-induced movement therapy and the control group will receive sham stimulation with CIMT. The primary outcome measure is safety assessment of transcranial direct current stimulation by physician evaluation, vital sign monitoring and symptom reports. Additionally, hand function will be evaluated using the Assisting Hand Assessment, grip strength and assessment of goals using the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure. Neuroimaging will confirm diagnoses, corticospinal tract integrity and cortical activation. Motor cortical excitability will also be examined using transcranial magnetic stimulation techniques.

Discussion

Combining non-invasive brain stimulation and CIMT interventions has the potential to improve motor function in children with congenital hemiparesis beyond each intervention independently. Such a combined intervention has the potential to benefit an individual throughout their lifetime.

### Efficacy and safety of transcranial direct current stimulation as an add-on treatment for bipolar depression: a randomized clinical trial [^1408c7b6]. JAMA Psychiatry (2018). Medium credibility.

Importance

More effective, tolerable interventions for bipolar depression treatment are needed. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a novel therapeutic modality with few severe adverse events that showed promising results for unipolar depression.

Objective

To determine the efficacy and safety of tDCS as an add-on treatment for bipolar depression.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A randomized, sham-controlled, double-blind trial (the Bipolar Depression Electrical Treatment Trial [BETTER]) was conducted from July 1, 2014, to March 30, 2016, at an outpatient, single-center academic setting. Participants included 59 adults with type I or II bipolar disorder in a major depressive episode and receiving a stable pharmacologic regimen with 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS-17) scores higher than 17. Data were analyzed in the intention-to-treat sample.

Interventions

Ten daily 30-minute, 2-mA, anodal-left and cathodal-right prefrontal sessions of active or sham tDCS on weekdays and then 1 session every fortnight until week 6.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Change in HDRS-17 scores at week 6.

Results

Fifty-nine patients (40 [68%] women), with a mean (SD) age of 45.9 (12) years participated; 36 (61%) with bipolar I and 23 (39%) with bipolar II disorder were randomized and 52 finished the trial. In the intention-to-treat analysis, patients in the active tDCS condition showed significantly superior improvement compared with those receiving sham (βint = -1.68; number needed to treat, 5.8; 95% CI, 3.3–25.8; P = 0.01). Cumulative response rates were higher in the active vs sham groups (67.6% vs 30.4%; number needed to treat, 2.69; 95% CI, 1.84–4.99; P = 0.01), but not remission rates (37.4% vs 19.1%; number needed to treat, 5.46; 95% CI, 3.38–14.2; P = 0.18). Adverse events, including treatment-emergent affective switches, were similar between groups, except for localized skin redness that was higher in the active group (54% vs 19%; P = 0.01).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this trial, tDCS was an effective, safe, and tolerable add-on intervention for this small bipolar depression sample. Further trials should examine tDCS efficacy in a larger sample.

### Brain responses to biological motion predict treatment outcome in young children with autism [^ddac9f11]. Translational Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Primary clinical outcome

Treatment effectiveness is modeled as the delta change scores of the SRS-parent total raw scores, that is, post minus pre, such that negative (positive) delta change scores indicate decrease (increase) in the core autism symptom severity. Treatment effectiveness was normally distributed, Shapiro–Wilk's W = 0.96, df = 20, P = 0.45, and was uncorrelated with pretreatment SRS-parent total raw scores, r (18) = −0.35, P = 0.13. To control for the passage of time, 11 of our participants were randomly assigned to a waitlist control group, and received treatment only after their 16-week waitlist period. The levels of ASD symptom severity did not significantly differ from the waitlist control baseline (−16 weeks; mean = 91.27, s.d. = 30.42) to the pretreatment baseline (0 weeks; mean = 84.27, s.d. = 24.06), Δ = −7.00, s.d. of Δ = 15.79, t (10) = −1.47, P = 0.17 (two-sided), 95% confidence interval of Δ = [−17.61, 3.61], Cohen's d rm = 0.24.

### Practice guideline for the treatment of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder [^e8019748]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in treatment-resistant obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) shows mixed results: A 6-week trial (three sessions per week) found no advantage for low-frequency right rTMS (n = 10) over sham stimulation (n = 8). In a 10-session, single-blind, 2-week trial, 12 patients were randomly assigned to right-side or left-side rTMS; evaluations after 2 weeks and 4 weeks later showed significant reduction in obsessions and compulsions in both groups with no significant difference between sides, and four patients had a clinically significant improvement (Y-BOCS reduction > 40%); no dropouts were reported and stimulation was well tolerated, with three patients reporting headache. In an open-label trial, 10 treatment-resistant patients received low-frequency rTMS for 2 weeks with medication doses stable for at least 12 weeks; eight patients completed the study with no dropouts due to side effects, Clinical Global Impression scores decreased significantly at the end of the first and second weeks with benefit maintained at the 1-month and 3-month follow-ups, three of the five patients with pure OCD had a clinically significant improvement with a > 40% reduction in Y-BOCS scores and two Tourette's patients had a complete remission at the second week, and six subjects (60%) had clinical improvement that persisted at 3-month follow-up. However, interpretation is limited by the absence of a placebo control group and the presence of concurrent pharmacotherapy.

### The priming effect of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation on clinical response to electroconvulsive therapy in treatment-resistant depression: a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled study [^c075f982]. Psychological Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is one of the most effective treatments for treatment-resistant depression (TRD). However, due to response delay and cognitive impairment, ECT remains an imperfect treatment. Compared to ECT, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is less effective at treating severe depression, but has the advantage of being quick, easy to use, and producing almost no side effects. In this study, our objective was to assess the priming effect of rTMS sessions before ECT on clinical response in patients with TRD.

Methods

In this multicenter, randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled trial, 56 patients with TRD were assigned to active or sham rTMS before ECT treatment. Five sessions of active/sham neuronavigated rTMS were administered over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (20 Hz, 90% resting motor threshold, 20 2 s trains with 60-s intervals, 800 pulses/session) before ECT (which was active for all patients) started. Any relative improvements were then compared between both groups after five ECT sessions, in order to assess the early response to treatment.

Results

After ECT, the active rTMS group exhibited a significantly greater relative improvement than the sham group [43.4% (28.6%) v. 25.4% (17.2%)]. The responder rate in the active group was at least three times higher. Cognitive complaints, which were assessed using the Cognitive Failures Questionnaire, were higher in the sham rTMS group compared to the active rTMS group, but this difference was not corroborated by cognitive tests.

Conclusions

rTMS could be used to enhance the efficacy of ECT in patients with TRD. ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02830399.

### Association between daily dose and efficacy of rTMS over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in depression: a meta-analysis [^54659b6e]. Psychiatry Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a well-established, safe, and effective brain stimulation technique for depression; however, uniform parameters have not been used in clinical practice. The aim of this study was to identify the parameters that affect rTMS effectiveness and ascertain the range in which that parameter has optimal efficacy. A meta-analysis of sham-controlled trials using rTMS delivered over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in depression was conducted. In the meta-regression and subgroup analyses, all rTMS stimulation parameters were extracted and their association with efficacy was investigated. Of the 17,800 references, 52 sham-controlled trials were included. Compared to sham controls, our results demonstrated a significant improvement in depressive symptoms at the end of treatment. According to the results of meta-regression, the number of pulses and sessions per day correlated with rTMS efficacy; however, the positioning method, stimulation intensity, frequency, number of treatment days, and total pulses did not. Furthermore, subgroup analysis revealed that the efficacy was correspondingly better in the group with higher daily pulses. In clinical practice, increasing the number of daily pulses and sessions may improve the effectiveness of rTMS.

### Brain stimulation and sensory integration in children with ASD… [^366020ee]. ClinicalTrials (2025). Medium credibility.

Brain Stimulation and Sensory Integration in Children With ASDClinicalTrials. gov ID Study Overview The goal of this clinical trial is to find out if brain stimulation can help improve sensory integration in children ages 6 to 12 with autism spectrum disorder. The main questions it aims to answer are: Does brain stimulation using continuous theta-burst stimulation on bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex improve how children process sights and sounds together. Can brain functioning, structure, and genetics help predict who responds best to this treatment. Researchers will compare the results of the randomly assigned active brain stimulation to sham stimulation groups to see if the treatment works.

Participants will: Receive 10 sessions of either active or sham cTBS over 2 weeks Complete a sensory task involving flashes and beeps before and after stimulation Take part in brain scans, namely magnetic resonance imaging and functional near-infrared spectroscopy, and provide a saliva sample for genetic testing. This study explores how noninvasive brain stimulation may support children with Autism Spectrum Disorder by improving how their brains process and combine sounds and images. It also investigates whether changes in brain function, brain structure, and specific genes can help predict how well a child might respond to this type of stimulation. The study is focused on a core challenge in ASD: differences in how children experience sensory input-especially how their brains process what they see and hear together. The central concept in this research is something called the Temporal Binding Window.

TBW refers to the brief time window in which the brain naturally fuses sensory information from different senses-like sight and sound-into a single event. For most people, this window is quite narrow: sounds and images that are even slightly out of sync are perceived as separate. But in many children with ASD, this window is wider. That means they may confuse the order or timing of sensory inputs, which can affect communication, behavior, and learning. To address this, the study uses a method called transcranial magnetic stimulation. This technique delivers brief, painless pulses of magnetic energy to the surface of the brain using a special coil held against the scalp. The type of TMS used here is called continuous theta burst stimulation, which delivers rapid bursts of magnetic pulses designed to gently decrease the excitability of targeted brain areas.

In this study, cTBS is used to modulate activity in a region called the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, which is important for regulating attention, working memory, and sensory control. A total of 40 children between the ages of 6 and 12 will take part. All participants must have a formal diagnosis of ASD, confirmed using a structured caregiver interview known as the Autism Diagnostic Interview
- Revised. They must also demonstrate average or above-average cognitive ability, based on a two-subscale IQ measure from the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children
- Fifth Edition. This ensures that all children can understand the tasks and safely undergo the procedures. Participants are randomly assigned to one of two groups: an active TMS group or a sham TMS group. In the sham group, the same equipment is used, but no actual magnetic stimulation reaches the brain.

### Effect of combined treatment with transcranial direct current stimulation and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation compared to monotherapy for the treatment of chronic insomnia: a randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, controlled trial [^e7b5d08a]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study examined the safety, feasibility, and efficacy of combining tDCS with rTMS in comparison with monotherapy for treating chronic insomnia in adult patients. The study involved 20 sessions of different neurotherapy protocols delivered over 4 consecutive weeks. Participants in the tDCS + rTMS treatment group showed significantly improved sleep status after 2 weeks of intervention compared to baseline. This improvement was sustained, with a further significant decrease in sleep scores observed after 4 weeks of intervention. At the 3-month follow-up after the end of treatment, it was found that the combination therapy group performed significantly better than the other two groups in terms of treatment continuity. These findings indicate that tDCS + rTMS may offer a rapid and effective approach to improving insomnia. Simultaneously, analysis of the response rate, remission rate, and changes in the scores of PSQI sub-items revealed a more significant therapeutic effect for the rTMS + tDCS treatment compared to the other two treatments. All indices consistently showed better effects in the group which underwent the combined treatment. Meanwhile, the combined tDCS + rTMS regimen group did not report more side effects, compared with the sham tDCS + rTMS and tDCS + sham rTMS groups. This indicates that the combined treatment regimen was well-tolerated and safe.

### Practice parameter for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with tic disorders [^a3f98715]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2013). Medium credibility.

Deep brain stimulation (DBS) and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in tic disorders — DBS is a surgical treatment approach that may hold benefit for a few treatment-refractory adults; however, few cases have been reported of youth receiving DBS for severe, treatment-resistant tics, and guidelines advise that this procedure should not be conducted in individuals less than 25 years of age outside of a research setting. An open-label study examining rTMS in youth with TD has been conducted with no reported adverse outcomes, but small adult studies have shown negative results; very few youth have received rTMS and it should be considered preliminary while larger blinded studies resolve safety, ethics, and long-term developmental impact. Neurosurgery and neurostimulation should be considered only in refractory cases, and clinicians should carefully weigh risks and benefits before recommending them for pediatric patients.

### Transcranial direct current stimulation combined with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation for depression: a randomized clinical trial [^f9f03367]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) are both recognized as effective treatments for depression when applied individually. However, it is unknown whether rTMS combined with tDCS has better efficacy in the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD).

Objective

To investigate the clinical effectiveness and safety of rTMS, tDCS, tDCS + rTMS, and sham tDCS + sham rTMS after 2 weeks of treatment in patients with MDD.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This double-blind, sham-controlled randomized clinical trial was conducted from November 2021 to April 2023 at 3 hospitals in China (Kangning Hospital affiliated with Ningbo University, Lishui Second People's Hospital, and Taizhou Second People's Hospital). Adult patients (aged 18–65 years) who were diagnosed with major depressive disorder were recruited. Participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 interventions: active tDCS + active rTMS, sham tDCS + active rTMS, active tDCS + sham rTMS, and sham tDCS + sham rTMS. Data analysis followed an intention-to-treat approach.

Intervention

Patients received a 2-week course of treatment. The tDCS was administered using a 2-mA direct current stimulator with electrodes placed on the left and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Each tDCS session lasted 20 minutes and was conducted 30 to 60 minutes prior to the rTMS session for a total of 10 sessions. The rTMS was delivered at a frequency of 10 Hz using a figure-8 coil placed on the left DLPFC, with each session consisting of 1600 pulses. Treatments were administered 5 times per week for 2 weeks. Sham treatments were performed with a pseudostimulation coil and emitted only sound.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was the change in total score from baseline to week 2 on the 24-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS-24; score range: 0–52, with the highest score indicating more severe symptoms).

Results

A total of 240 participants (139 females [57.9%]; mean [SD] age, 32.50 [15.18] years) were included. As a primary outcome, patients who received active tDCS + active rTMS showed a significantly greater reduction in mean (SD) HDRS-24 total scores compared with patients in the other 3 groups (active tDCS + active rTMS: 18.33 [5.39], sham tDCS + active rTMS: 14.86 [5.59], active tDCS + sham rTMS: 9.21 [4.61], and sham tDCS + sham rTMS: 10.77 [5.67]; F3,236 = 35.79; η² = 0.31 [95% CI, 0.21–0.39]; P < .001).

Conclusions and Relevance

This trial found that tDCS + rTMS was a more effective and safe treatment option than either the tDCS or rTMS intervention alone for patients with MDD.

Subgroup analyses for TMS trials of core symptoms

Stimulation site and frequency

Across disorders, the most common TMS stimulation site was the unilateral left (L) or right (R) dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) or bilateral DLPFC. For unipolar depression, BLDLPFC and HF-LDLPFC TMS were superior to sham. For OCD, BLDLPFC, LF-RDLPFC and LF supplementary motor area (LF-SMA) TMS were each superior to sham. For PTSD, HF-RDLPFC, and LF-RDLPFC TMS were superior to sham. For schizophrenia negative symptoms HF-LDLPFC was superior to sham (Table 3).

Number of treatment sessions

For unipolar depression, HF-LDLPFC trials of 10, 20 and 30 sessions were superior to sham. For OCD, BLDLPFC, and LF-RDLPFC trials of 10–20 treatment sessions and LF-SMA trials of 10–25 sessions were superior to sham. For PTSD, 10–20 sessions of LF-RDLPFC were superior to sham. For schizophrenia, HF-LDLPFC trials of 10, 15, and 20 sessions were superior to sham (Table 3).

Sensitivity analyses of core symptoms

### Transcranial direct current stimulation is safe and effective in autoimmune myopathies: a randomised, double-blind, sham-controlled trial [^5d3c9407]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in patients with systemic autoimmune myopathies (SAMs).

Methods

This prospective, randomised, sham-controlled, double-blind, study included 20 patients with SAMs allocated to receive sham or active tDCS (2mA, 20 minutes, 3 days). Electrodes were positioned with the anode over the C1 or C2, whereas the cathode was placed over the Fp2 or Fp1, respectively. The groups were evaluated in four periods with specific questionnaires and functional tests: pre-stimulation and after 30 minutes, three weeks, and eight weeks post-tDCS.

Results

Two patients from the sham group withdrew after the three sessions. The demographic data, type of myositis, disease duration, and disease status were comparable between the active and sham tDCS groups. After interventions, in the active tDCS group, the physical aspects of SF-36 in week eight, mean and better timed up-and-go test at each evaluation, peak torque of stimulated inferior limb extension improved significantly (p < 0.05). The emotional aspect of SF-36 decreased only in the active tDCS group (p < 0.001). The patients' adherence to the protocol was 100% and no serious adverse event was reported, including disease relapses.

Conclusions

This study evidences the safety of tDCS, as well as its potential efficacy in improving muscle strength and function in SAMs patients. More studies with a larger sample and longer tDCS sessions are necessary to corroborate the results of the present study.
