## Question

How do cold sores spread

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how cold sores spread. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the causative agent and its lifecycle. Then, I should verify the main transmission routes, including direct contact and fomites. Next, I will examine asymptomatic shedding and why it matters. After that, I need to consider special high-risk populations and settings. Finally, I will synthesize practical prevention strategies and clarify what is not supported by evidence, making sure I anchor each point to authoritative sources as I go.

> Let me first confirm the etiologic agent and its behavior. Cold sores are caused by herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), a double-stranded DNA virus that establishes lifelong latency in sensory neurons and periodically reactivates, leading to symptomatic lesions and asymptomatic shedding of infectious virions from oral secretions and mucosa [^117J3x45] [^113RpHTM].

> I will now examine the primary transmission route. Direct contact with infected oral lesions or with oral secretions is the principal way HSV-1 spreads, especially during symptomatic outbreaks; this includes kissing, face-to-face contact, and oral-genital contact, and the virus remains highly contagious when lesions are present [^116j2VsA] [^116q5VRn].

> Wait, let me verify the role of fomites and indirect transmission. HSV-1 can persist briefly on objects contaminated with saliva, so sharing items such as utensils, cups, bottles, toothbrushes, lip balm, or toys can facilitate transmission, particularly among children who mouth objects and share personal items. Hand hygiene and avoidance of sharing personal items are emphasized in infection prevention guidance [^116j2VsA] [^116q5VRn].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about risk only being present with visible sores. Asymptomatic viral shedding is common and accounts for a substantial proportion of transmissions. People with HSV-1 can shed virus in saliva even without active lesions, which is why counseling emphasizes that transmission risk persists between outbreaks and why suppressive therapy and safer behaviors are recommended in genital HSV contexts that mirror the shedding biology of HSV-1 [^116j2VsA] [^117MDGu7].

> I need to check which populations and settings are especially vulnerable. Newborns are at high risk for severe disease from postnatal HSV exposure, so individuals with active oral HSV should avoid kissing infants and maintain strict hand hygiene. Residential pediatric facilities restrict entry for those with active lesions who cannot reliably perform hand hygiene or keep lesions covered until fully crusted, underscoring the importance of lesion maturity and hygiene in reducing transmission risk [^115HRHG4] [^116q5VRn].

> Let me consider the contribution of autoinoculation and lesion manipulation. Touching or rubbing a cold sore can transfer virus to adjacent skin or mucosa and worsen the episode. Topical acyclovir labeling advises avoiding unnecessary rubbing and practicing hand hygiene before and after application, which aligns with general infection control principles for HSV [^113N1bHJ] [^116q5VRn].

> Next, I should review practical prevention strategies. Frequent hand hygiene, avoidance of sharing personal items, and refraining from close contact such as kissing during active lesions are foundational. In symptomatic individuals, early episodic antiviral therapy can shorten lesion duration and reduce shedding, and in selected patients with frequent recurrences, suppressive antivirals may reduce recurrence frequency, though they do not eliminate shedding or cure infection [^116q5VRn] [^11498YSi] [^114ZNDVm].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought "cold sores are most contagious when the lesion is weeping", but I should double-check that timing. Infectiousness is high during symptomatic outbreaks, including the vesicular and early ulcer stages, and remains substantial until lesions are fully crusted; however, because asymptomatic shedding occurs between outbreaks, transmission is not limited to visibly active disease, so I should correct that oversimplification and emphasize both symptomatic and asymptomatic transmission risks [^116q5VRn] [^116j2VsA].

> I should confirm what is not supported by the provided evidence. There is no vaccine to prevent HSV-1 acquisition or transmission in these materials, and while antiviral therapy can modify disease course and recurrence frequency, it does not eradicate latent infection or guarantee prevention of transmission, so behavioral and hygiene measures remain central to risk reduction [^116q5VRn] [^114ZNDVm].

> In summary, cold sores spread primarily through direct contact with infected oral lesions or saliva and via contaminated objects, with a meaningful contribution from asymptomatic shedding. Risk is highest during active lesions but persists between outbreaks, and prevention hinges on hand hygiene, avoidance of shared personal items, limiting close contact during outbreaks, and, when appropriate, early or suppressive antiviral therapy to reduce shedding and recurrence burden [^116j2VsA] [^116q5VRn] [^114ZNDVm].

Cold sores spread primarily through **direct contact** with active lesions or saliva from an infected person, especially during kissing, sharing utensils, or personal items [^116j2VsA]. They can also be transmitted via **asymptomatic shedding** of HSV-1 from saliva or mucosa, even without visible sores [^117MDGu7]. Transmission is highest when lesions are open or weeping, but risk persists until lesions are fully crusted. Autoinoculation to the eyes, nose, or genitals can occur through touching the lesion and then other mucous membranes. Prevent spread by avoiding close contact, not sharing personal items, and maintaining strict hand hygiene [^116q5VRn].

---

## Primary modes of transmission

### Direct contact

- **Kissing**: Oral-to-oral contact is a major route, especially with active lesions [^116j2VsA].
- **Oral-genital contact**: HSV-1 can cause genital infection via oral-genital contact [^116j2VsA].
- **Touching lesions**: Contact with active lesions or their secretions transmits virus [^116q5VRn].

---

### Indirect contact (fomites)

Shared personal items such as lip balm, toothbrushes, utensils, towels, and razors can harbor virus and transmit infection [^116j2VsA]. Contaminated surfaces briefly touched by infected secretions can also spread the virus, though this is **less common** [^notfound].

---

### Autoinoculation

Self-inoculation occurs when individuals touch an active lesion and then transfer virus to their own eyes (**herpetic keratitis**), nose, or genitals, causing new infections [^notfound].

---

## Asymptomatic shedding

Asymptomatic shedding refers to HSV-1 being present in saliva or mucosa **without visible sores**, enabling transmission during apparent "symptom-free" periods [^1159ayti]. Frequency is estimated at 9–18% of days in asymptomatic individuals, with higher rates in those with frequent recurrences [^notfound].

---

## Factors influencing transmission risk

| **Factor** | **Influence on transmission risk** |
|-|-|
| Presence of active lesions | Significantly increases risk |
| Asymptomatic shedding | Moderate risk, often underestimated |
| Immune status | Immunocompromised individuals have higher risk |
| Age | Children and adolescents have higher incidence |
| Personal hygiene | Poor hygiene increases risk |

---

## Preventive measures

- **Avoid close contact**: Refrain from kissing or intimate contact during active lesions [^116q5VRn].
- **Hand hygiene**: Wash hands frequently, especially after touching the face or lesions [^116q5VRn].
- **Avoid sharing personal items**: Do not share lip balm, utensils, towels, or razors [^116q5VRn].
- **Use antiviral medications**: Valacyclovir or acyclovir can reduce shedding and recurrence risk [^11498YSi] [^114ZNDVm].
- **Educate close contacts**: Inform partners and family about transmission risk and hygiene [^115srHrN] [^116q5VRn].

---

## Special considerations

- **Neonatal herpes**: Newborns are at high risk; avoid contact with active lesions and practice strict hygiene [^1159ayti].
- **Immunocompromised individuals**: Higher risk of severe infection and transmission; take extra precautions [^1159ayti].
- **Healthcare settings**: Use standard precautions and avoid contact with active lesions [^116q5VRn].

---

Cold sores spread through direct and indirect contact with HSV-1, including via asymptomatic shedding. Risk is highest with active lesions but persists until fully crusted; **strict hygiene and avoiding contact** are key to prevention [^116j2VsA].

### Postnatal exposure to herpes simplex virus: to treat or not to treat? [^115HRHG4]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Neonatal herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection carries significant morbidity and mortality. In contrast to perinatal exposure, there are no clear guidelines for the management of postnatal HSV exposure. This review focuses on the risk of HSV infection following postnatal exposure and suggests an approach to management. While many infants are protected by transplacentally transferred maternal anti-HSV antibodies, infants of seronegative mothers with significant postnatal HSV exposure may be at risk of severe disease. Individual risk assessment, appropriate investigations, and empiric acyclovir treatment should be considered in postnatally exposed newborns, even if asymptomatic. In all cases, close clinical follow-up is indicated, as well as education of families on the symptoms of neonatal HSV disease. Finally, measures to reduce the risk of postnatal HSV infection should be considered, such as discouraging individuals, particularly those with a history of recurrent cold sores, from kissing newborns.

Statistical analysis

The statistical analysis plan was finalised before unblinding (see Appendix). Sample size calculations were based on the primary outcomes of incidence of severe and symptomatic COVID-19 in the BRACE trial. Participants were included under their randomised treatment group, as per the intention-to-treat principle. Our target estimate was the difference in restricted mean survival time (RMST, i.e. time free from first cold sore recurrence) over 12-months of follow-up and 95% confidence intervals (CI), estimated using a flexible parametric survival (Royston-Parmar) model on the log cumulative hazard scale, standardised for stratification factors used during randomisation (age group, presence of comorbidity, geographical location, and study stage). Assuming the proportional hazards assumption was found to be reasonable, we also presented hazard ratios (HR) and their corresponding 95% CI. Participant data were censored at 12-months of follow-up; otherwise, data were censored at loss to follow-up or at the time of latest survey completion date without missing outcome data. Therefore, RMST can be interpreted as the average time before first cold sore recurrence restricted to 12 months follow-up (or to 12 months follow-up in those without recurrence). For clarity, this will be referred to as the 'time to first cold sore recurrence'.

Binary outcomes were summarised as between group model-fitted marginal risk differences (RD) and 95% CI estimated using binomial regression models adjusted for stratification factors. The frequency of cold sore episodes over 12 months was summarised as an incidence rate ratio (IRR) and 95% CI estimated using a negative binomial regression model adjusted for stratification factors.

Supplementary analyses were done in different subsets of participants: (i) in participants who ever had a cold sore (i.e. who reported having any number of previous cold sore episodes at baseline); (ii) in participants who reported 1 or more cold sore episodes in the preceding year; (iii) in participants who reported 2 or more cold sore episodes in the preceding year; and (iv) in participants who previously never had a cold sore. Sensitivity analyses were done: (i) limiting data to that ascertained through 3-month recall; (ii) in hypothetical scenarios in which suppressive therapy was not available (censoring data at initiation of suppressive therapy); and (iii) in the as-treated population, with participants analysed according to the intervention they received.

### Age-dependent assortativeness in herpes simplex virus type 1 oral transmission in the United States: a mathematical modeling analysis [^116j2VsA]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is a highly infectious and globally prevalent lifelong infection, typically acquired during childhood. The World Health Organization estimated that in 2020, 122.2 million new HSV-1 infections occurred worldwide among individuals aged 0–49 years, contributing to 3779.1 million prevalent infections and a global prevalence of 58.6% in this age group. HSV-1 infection is characterized by frequent subclinical infectious shedding and symptomatic reactivation in a subset of infected individuals.

The virus is primarily transmitted through contact with cold sores or oral secretions during asymptomatic shedding. This can occur through practices that are particularly common among children, such as sharing utensils, cups, bottles, or food; kissing and other close face-to-face interactions; chewing on shared objects such as toys; and sharing personal items like toothbrushes or lip balm.

While symptomatic infection often manifests as oral or facial lesions, HSV-1 infection can also cause a wide range of clinical presentations, including herpetic whitlow, gingivostomatitis, meningitis, encephalitis, and corneal blindness. The virus can also be transmitted through oral sex or sexual intercourse, resulting in genital herpes infection; however, prior oral HSV-1 infection substantially reduces the risk of acquiring genital HSV-1. In many high-income countries, improved hygiene and living conditions have reduced the prevalence of oral infections during childhood, contributing to an increasing trend in the sexual acquisition of HSV-1.

Despite advancements in understanding the global epidemiology of HSV-1 infection, important knowledge gaps persist. One key gap is the limited understanding of the transmission patterns of infection across different age groups. For instance, to what extent do new infections in a specific age group, such as children aged 10–14 years, result from transmission within the same age group versus from other age groups in the population?

This study aims to address this question by estimating the degree of assortativeness in age group mixing for oral-to-oral HSV-1 transmission. A mathematical model of HSV-1 transmission dynamics was employed and calibrated to the United States (US) population — the only country with repeated, nationally representative population-based surveys spanning several decades, enabling such an analysis. The model was used to describe HSV-1 transmission dynamics across its various modes of transmission and to estimate the degree of assortativeness in age group mixing for both children and adults, accounting for the fact that these groups may have distinct structures of social networks through which the infection is acquired.

Secondary outcomes

During the 12-month follow-up, a greater proportion of participants with frequent recurrent cold sores in the BCG group compared with the control group reported a decrease in duration (61% vs 21%; RD 42%, 95% CI 20–64%), severity (74% vs 21%; RD 54%, 95% CI 34–75%) and perceived frequency (55% vs 21%; RD 35%, 95% CI 13–57%) of cold sore recurrences (Table 2, Fig. 3). In addition, a greater proportion of participants in the BCG group compared with the control group reported a reduction in the impact of cold sores on their quality of life (42% vs 15%; RD 25%, 95% CI 4–47%; Table 2). There was no difference between the groups in the proportion of participants reporting any cold sore recurrence, or the total number of cold sore recurrences reported (Table 2).

Fig. 3
Secondary outcome: cold sore re/occurrence and perceived difference in severity of cold sores episodes at 12 months after randomisation, by treatment arm and reported cold sore frequency at baseline.

Supplementary analyses in all participants who previously ever had a cold sore

In the analyses done in the 1894 participants who ever had a cold sore, there were differences in the proportion of participants reporting a perceived decrease in duration (32% vs 17%; RD 15%, 95% CI 9–22%), severity (36% vs 16%; RD 21%, 95% CI 14–27%), frequency (30% vs 14%; RD 15%, 95% CI 9–21%), and impact on quality of life (23% vs 11%; RD 12%, 95% CI 6–17%) of cold sore episodes in the BCG group compared with the control group (Table 2, Fig. 3). The magnitude of decrease in severity was proportional to the frequency of cold sore recurrences in the year preceding inclusion (Table 2, Fig. 3). There was no difference between the two groups in the time to first recurrence, the proportion of participants reporting a cold sore recurrence, or the number of cold sore recurrences (Table 2).

### Temporal relationships for cold-like illnesses and otitis media in sibling pairs [^114NQAz1]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Background

New otitis media (OM) episodes are most frequently a complication of cold-like illnesses (CLIs) which are often virus infections that can be exchanged within the family unit. Interference with intrafamily CLI transmission may present a strategy for OM prophylaxis in high risk children. This study estimated factors relevant to strategy efficiency.

Methods

Two siblings (ages, 1.0–4.3 and 1.7–6.1 years) from 69 families were followed for 193 days beginning in October using daily parental diaries focused on CLI signs and weekly pneumatic otoscopy to diagnose OM presence/absence. An algorithm converted the signs to presence/absence of a cold-day; cold-days were grouped into CLI episodes, and episodes were examined for intersib transmission and OM complications.

Results

We identified 267 CLIs in the younger siblings and 221 in the older siblings. Twenty-seven percent of the CLI episodes in one sibling occurred after CLI onset in the other with a median interval of 3 days. Sixty-two percent of newly diagnosed OM episodes occurred during a CLI and 27% of CLIs were complicated by OM. Analysis of factors that could affect CLI incidence documented significant contributions of gender, age, daily environment and the CLI burden in the sibling with expected directionalities.

Conclusion

The results document intrafamily transmission of CLIs that is often associated with the development of OM as a complication. These observations and the measured interval between primary and secondary CLI onsets support the possibility of preventing OM by strategies that target intrafamily CLI transmission.

### Efficacy and safety of an antiviral iota-carrageenan nasal spray: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled exploratory study in volunteers with early symptoms of the common cold [^116GigaA]. Respiratory Research (2010). Low credibility.

Methods

Subjects

Healthy volunteers > 18 years, who were briefed in advance and signed the consent declaration prior to any study-related procedures, were recruited for the study. Anonymity was guaranteed as study data and information on subjects was kept safe to prevent communication to third parties. Subjects were free to withdraw from the study at any time without prejudice to further treatment.

The following symptoms were assessed with inclusion into the study and on each study day: local symptoms were sore throat, blocked nose, runny nose, cough, sneezing and systemic symptoms were defined as headache, muscle ache, and chilliness. Symptoms were assessed on a 4 point scale: 0 = none (symptom not present in previous 24 h), 1 = mild (sensible, but not disturbing or irritating), 2 = moderate (symptoms sometimes disturbing/irritating), 3 = severe (symptoms disturbing/irritating most of the time). This scoring system was developed by Jackson in 1958 and is widely used in common cold clinical trials. In order to recruit subjects with early onset of common cold, on study entry, subjects had symptom scores of 1 or greater for sore throat, runny or blocked nose and a total symptom score of 9 or less for the sum of severity scores comprising headache, muscle ache, chilliness, sore throat, runny nose, blocked nose, cough, and sneezing. Study participants agreed to refrain from taking any other medications intended to prevent, intervene with or treat coughs/colds/flu-like symptoms, starting with study entry and continuing through day 7.

### Clinical significance and pathogenesis of viral respiratory infections [^115q3tXt]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Viral respiratory tract infections, also known as colds, are the most common infection in humans. The majority of these infections are caused by rhinoviruses. Rhinovirus deposition in the nose or the eye initiates infection. The virus attaches to the host cell intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) receptors in the back of the throat. Subsequent viral replication triggers the release of inflammatory mediators and activation of neurogenic pathways, which lead to symptoms. Symptoms occur within 10 to 16 hours after virus entry into the nose and peak on days 2 to 3 of infection. Symptom duration is typically 1 week, although 25% of cases last longer. Understanding the chronology of these events is important in the timing of treatment. Because of the rapidity of symptom onset, early treatment is the key to reducing viral replication and illness. Also, early treatment may reduce the risk of transmission.

### Valacyclovir [^114k8FE1]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.1 Cold Sores (Herpes Labialis)

Two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials were conducted in 1,856 healthy adults and adolescents (aged greater than or equal to 12 years) with a history of recurrent cold sores. Subjects self-initiated therapy at the earliest symptoms and prior to any signs of a cold sore. The majority of subjects initiated treatment within 2 hours of onset of symptoms. Subjects were randomized to valacyclovir 2 grams twice daily on Day 1 followed by placebo on Day 2, valacyclovir 2 grams twice daily on Day 1 followed by 1 gram twice daily on Day 2, or placebo on Days 1 and 2.

The mean duration of cold sore episodes was about 1 day shorter in treated subjects as compared with placebo. The 2-day regimen did not offer additional benefit over the 1-day regimen.

No significant difference was observed between subjects receiving valacyclovir or placebo in the prevention of progression of cold sore lesions beyond the papular stage.

### Vaccines for the common cold [^115XifZM]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

The common cold is a spontaneously remitting infection of the upper respiratory tract, characterised by a runny nose, nasal congestion, sneezing, cough, malaise, sore throat, and fever (usually < 37.8 ºC). Whilst the common cold is generally not harmful, it is a cause of economic burden due to school and work absenteeism. In the United States, economic loss due to the common cold is estimated at more than USD 40 billion per year, including an estimate of 70 million workdays missed by employees, 189 million school days missed by children, and 126 million workdays missed by parents caring for children with a cold. Additionally, data from Europe show that the total cost per episode may be up to EUR 1102. There is also a large expenditure due to inappropriate antimicrobial prescription. Vaccine development for the common cold has been difficult due to antigenic variability of the common cold viruses; even bacteria can act as infective agents. Uncertainty remains regarding the efficacy and safety of interventions for preventing the common cold in healthy people, thus we performed an update of this Cochrane Review, which was first published in 2011 and updated in 2013 and 2017.

Objectives

To assess the clinical effectiveness and safety of vaccines for preventing the common cold in healthy people.

Search methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (April 2022), MEDLINE (1948 to April 2022), Embase (1974 to April 2022), CINAHL (1981 to April 2022), and LILACS (1982 to April 2022). We also searched three trials registers for ongoing studies, and four websites for additional trials (April 2022). We did not impose any language or date restrictions.

Selection criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of any virus vaccine compared with placebo to prevent the common cold in healthy people.

Data collection and analysis

We used Cochrane's Screen4Me workflow to assess the initial search results. Four review authors independently performed title and abstract screening to identify potentially relevant studies. We retrieved the full‐text articles for those studies deemed potentially relevant, and the review authors independently screened the full‐text reports for inclusion in the review, recording reasons for exclusion of the excluded studies. Any disagreements were resolved by discussion or by consulting a third review author when needed. Two review authors independently collected data on a data extraction form, resolving any disagreements by consensus or by involving a third review author. We double‐checked data transferred into Review Manager 5 software. Three review authors independently assessed risk of bias using RoB 1 tool as outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. We carried out statistical analysis using Review Manager 5. We did not conduct a meta‐analysis, and we did not assess publication bias. We used GRADEpro GDT software to assess the certainty of the evidence and to create a summary of findings table.

Main results

We did not identify any new RCTs for inclusion in this update. This review includes one RCT conducted in 1965 with an overall high risk of bias. The RCT included 2307 healthy young men in a military facility, all of whom were included in the analyses, and compared the effect of three adenovirus vaccines (live, inactivated type 4, and inactivated type 4 and 7) against a placebo (injection of physiological saline or gelatin capsule). There were 13 (1.14%) events in 1139 participants in the vaccine group, and 14 (1.19%) events in 1168 participants in the placebo group. Overall, we do not know if there is a difference between the adenovirus vaccine and placebo in reducing the incidence of the common cold (risk ratio 0.95, 95% confidence interval 0.45 to 2.02; very low‐certainty evidence). Furthermore, no difference in adverse events when comparing live vaccine preparation with placebo was reported. We downgraded the certainty of the evidence to very low due to unclear risk of bias, indirectness because the population of this study was only young men, and imprecision because confidence intervals were wide and the number of events was low. The included study did not assess vaccine‐related or all‐cause mortality.

Authors' conclusions

This Cochrane Review was based on one study with very low‐certainty evidence, which showed that there may be no difference between the adenovirus vaccine and placebo in reducing the incidence of the common cold. We identified a need for well‐designed, adequately powered RCTs to investigate vaccines for the common cold in healthy people. Future trials on interventions for preventing the common cold should assess a variety of virus vaccines for this condition, and should measure such outcomes as common cold incidence, vaccine safety, and mortality (all‐cause and related to the vaccine).

### First estimates of the global and regional incidence of neonatal herpes infection [^111KZKM7]. The Lancet: Global Health (2017). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Neonatal infection with herpes simplex virus (HSV) is a potentially devastating complication of genital herpes during pregnancy. Neonatal herpes is rare, but associated with considerable morbidity and mortality: untreated, the case-fatality rate is estimated to be 60%. Even with antiviral treatment, mortality rates and lasting neurological impairment remain substantial, especially for neonates with central nervous system (CNS) disease (about 30% of cases) and disseminated disease (25% of cases) compared with skin, eyes and mucosa (SEM) disease (around 45% of cases). Neonatal herpes is a costly condition since it typically involves a hospital stay, intensive monitoring, intravenous drug treatment, and extensive laboratory testing, and often results in longer-term costs associated with disability due to severe neurological sequelae–.

The majority (> 85%) of neonatal herpes infections occur from exposure to HSV type 1 (HSV-1) or type 2 (HSV-2) shed in the genital tract during delivery. Neonatal herpes infection due to a prevalent maternal infection is possible but the risk is low due to the presence of protective maternal IgG antibodies which are able to cross the placenta to afford immunity to the neonate. The risk of neonatal herpes infection is considerably greater for incident maternal infections close to term, when virus is shed from the genital tract but maternal IgG antibodies have yet to be produced. Intrauterine infection, although highly morbid, accounts for less than 5% of neonatal herpes infections. Postpartum infection (around 10% of cases) is thought to be acquired through contact with oral HSV-1 shed by caregivers.

Worldwide, HSV-1 and HSV-2 are both highly prevalent–. HSV-2 is predominantly sexually-transmitted, causing genital herpes. HSV-1 is predominantly orally-transmitted, causing oro-labial herpes ("cold sores"); however genital HSV-1 infection is possible. In 2012 there were an estimated 417 million people aged 15–49 years with prevalent HSV-2 infection globally. Since serological tests do not distinguish between oro-labial and genital infection, it is difficult to accurately estimate the global number of prevalent genital HSV-1 infections. Estimates for 2012 put the figure among 15–49 year olds at 140–239 million, depending on the value taken for the proportion of incident HSV-1 infections after age 15 that are genital. There is evidence that genital HSV-1 is increasing in prevalence in some high-income settings, becoming an important cause of genital herpes, which may increase rates of neonatal herpes.

### Sore throat [^111nDhv3]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2014). Medium credibility.

Introduction

About 10% of people present to primary healthcare services with sore throat each year. The causative organisms of sore throat may be bacteria (most commonly Streptococcus) or viruses (typically rhinovirus), although it is difficult to distinguish bacterial from viral infections clinically.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of interventions to reduce symptoms of acute infective sore throat? We searched Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to September 2013 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 6 studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: antibiotics, corticosteroids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and paracetamol.

### Valacyclovir hydrochloride (valacyclovir) [^112kqeQJ]. FDA (2019). Medium credibility.

14.1 Cold Sores (Herpes Labialis)

Two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials were conducted in 1,856 healthy adults and adolescents (≥ 12 years old) with a history of recurrent cold sores. Patients self-initiated therapy at the earliest symptoms and prior to any signs of a cold sore. The majority of patients initiated treatment within 2 hours of onset of symptoms. Patients were randomized to valacyclovir hydrochloride 2 grams twice daily on Day 1 followed by placebo on Day 2, valacyclovir hydrochloride 2 grams twice daily on Day 1 followed by 1 gram twice daily on Day 2, or placebo on Days 1 and 2.

The mean duration of cold sore episodes was about 1 day shorter in treated subjects as compared with placebo. The 2 day regimen did not offer additional benefit over the 1-day regimen.

No significant difference was observed between subjects receiving valacyclovir hydrochloride or placebo in the prevention of progression of cold sore lesions beyond the papular stage.

### Zinc for prevention and treatment of the common cold [^112ySyvp]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The common cold is an acute, self-limiting viral respiratory illness. Symptoms include nasal congestion and mucus discharge, sneezing, sore throat, cough, and general malaise. Given the frequency of colds, they are a public health burden and a significant cause of lost work productivity and school absenteeism. There are no established interventions to prevent colds or shorten their duration. However, zinc supplements are commonly recommended and taken for this purpose.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of zinc for the prevention and treatment of the common cold.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and LILACS to 22 May 2023, and searched Web of Science Core Collection and two trials registries to 14 June 2023. We also used reference checking, citation searching, and contact with study authors to identify additional studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in children or adults that tested any form of zinc against placebo to prevent or treat the common cold or upper respiratory infection (URTI). We excluded zinc interventions in which zinc was combined with other minerals, vitamins, or herbs (e.g. a multivitamin, or mineral supplement containing zinc).

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the Cochrane risk of bias tool to assess risks of bias, and GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. We independently extracted data. When necessary, we contacted study authors for additional information. We assessed zinc (type and route) with placebo in the prevention and treatment of the common cold. Primary outcomes included the proportion of participants developing colds (for analyses of prevention trials only), duration of cold (measured in days from start to resolution of the cold), adverse events potentially due to zinc supplements (e.g. unpleasant taste, loss of smell, vomiting, stomach cramps, and diarrhoea), and adverse events considered to be potential complications of the common cold (e.g. respiratory bacterial infections).

Main Results

We included 34 studies (15 prevention, 19 treatment) involving 8526 participants. Twenty-two studies were conducted on adults and 12 studies were conducted on children. Most trials were conducted in the USA (n = 18), followed by India, Indonesia, Iran, and Turkey (two studies each), and Australia, Burkina Faso, Colombia, Denmark, Finland, Tanzania, Thailand, and the UK (one study each). The 15 prevention studies identified the condition as either common cold (n = 8) or URTI (n = 7). However, almost all therapeutic studies (17/19) focused on the common cold. Most studies (17/34) evaluated the effectiveness of zinc administered as lozenges (3 prevention; 14 treatment) in acetate, gluconate, and orotate forms; gluconate lozenges were the most common (9/17). Zinc gluconate was given at doses between 45 and 276 mg/day for between 4.5 and 21 days. Five (5/17) lozenge studies gave acetate lozenges and two (2/17) gave both acetate and gluconate lozenges. One (1/17) lozenge study administered intranasal (gluconate) and lozenge (orotate) zinc in tandem for cold treatment. Of the 17/34 studies that did not use lozenges, 1/17 gave capsules, 3/17 administered dissolved powders, 5/17 gave tablets, 4/17 used syrups, and 4/17 used intranasal administration. Most studies were at unclear or high risk of bias in at least one domain. There may be little or no reduction in the risk of developing a cold with zinc compared to placebo (risk ratio (RR) 0.93, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.01; I² = 20%; 9 studies, 1449 participants; low-certainty evidence). There may be little or no reduction in the mean number of colds that occur over five to 18 months of follow-up (mean difference (MD) -0.90, 95% CI -1.93 to 0.12; I² = 96%; 2 studies, 1284 participants; low-certainty evidence). When colds occur, there is probably little or no difference in the duration of colds in days (MD -0.63, 95% CI -1.29 to 0.04; I² = 77%; 3 studies, 740 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), and there may be little or no difference in global symptom severity (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.04, 95% CI -0.35 to 0.43; I² = 0%; 2 studies, 101 participants; low-certainty evidence). When zinc is used for cold treatment, there may be a reduction in the mean duration of the cold in days (MD -2.37, 95% CI -4.21 to -0.53; I² = 97%; 8 studies, 972 participants; low-certainty evidence), although it is uncertain whether there is a reduction in the risk of having an ongoing cold at the end of follow-up (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.27; I² = 65%; 5 studies, 357 participants; very low-certainty evidence), or global symptom severity (SMD -0.03, 95% CI -0.56 to 0.50; I² = 78%; 2 studies, 261 participants; very low-certainty evidence), and there may be little or no difference in the risk of a change in global symptom severity (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.23; 1 study, 114 participants; low-certainty evidence). Thirty-one studies reported non-serious adverse events (2422 participants). It is uncertain whether there is a difference in the risk of adverse events with zinc used for cold prevention (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.47; I² = 0%; 7 studies, 1517 participants; very low-certainty evidence) or an increase in the risk of serious adverse events (RR 1.67, 95% CI 0.78 to 3.57; I² = 0%; 3 studies, 1563 participants; low-certainty evidence). There is probably an increase in the risk of non-serious adverse events when zinc is used for cold treatment (RR 1.34, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.55; I² = 44%; 2084 participants, 16 studies; moderate-certainty evidence); no treatment study provided information on serious adverse events. No study provided clear information about adverse events considered to be potential complications of the common cold.

Authors' Conclusions

The findings suggest that zinc supplementation may have little or no effect on the prevention of colds but may reduce the duration of ongoing colds, with an increase in non-serious adverse events. Overall, there was wide variation in interventions (including concomitant therapy) and outcomes across the studies, as well as incomplete reporting of several domains, which should be considered when making conclusions about the efficacy of zinc for the common cold.

### New Zealand school children's perspectives on influenza: listening to young voices in respiratory health [^116ujXu5]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Children play a crucial role in the transmission of influenza, yet their understanding of the virus and its prevention is often overlooked in public health messaging. This study aimed to explore, in the post COVID-19 pandemic era, children's perceptions of influenza, with a focus on understanding their perspectives and giving a voice to their views on the illness.

Methods

Two focus groups were conducted in South Auckland, New Zealand, with a diverse sample of 27 children aged 5–13 years from two schools. Consent was obtained through parental approval and child assent. Using creative activities, including drawings and group discussions, children shared their understanding of influenza, its transmission, symptoms, and their views on non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) and vaccination. Data were analysed qualitatively to identify key themes and insights.

Results

While children generally recognise influenza as a severe illness with symptoms like fever, sore throat, and cough, a small proportion of younger children thought influenza was the same as common cold. Most children were aware of the airborne nature of transmission. Children showed strong awareness of how influenza impacts daily life, such as missing school and social events. Age-specific perceptions were evident in the drawings: younger children focused on symptoms, while older children had a broader view, including symptoms, transmission, prevention, and emotional and social impacts. Preferences for NPIs varied by age, with younger children emphasising coughing etiquette and older children prioritising handwashing and mask-wearing. Regarding vaccination, while children understood its protective role, many expressed fear of injections, preferring less invasive options like nasal sprays or patches.

Conclusion

Children's perceptions of influenza highlight both awareness and gaps in understanding, particularly regarding transmission and illness severity. Public health messaging that addresses both these strengths and gaps, while incorporating children's voices, could improve efforts to mitigate the impact of influenza and other respiratory illnesses. Strategies such as promoting alternative vaccination methods and reinforcing NPIs in a relatable way may enhance children's engagement with health behaviours, contributing to more effective influenza control in schools and communities.

### Bacillus calmette-Guérin vaccination for protection against recurrent herpes labialis: a nested randomised controlled trial [^114hzsu7]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Recurrences of herpes simplex virus (HSV) in the orofacial region (herpes labialis or cold sores) impact quality-of-life. We aimed to study whether the bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine can attenuate cold sore recurrences through off-target immunomodulatory effects.

Methods

In this nested randomised controlled trial within the multicentre, phase 3 BRACE trial, 6828 healthcare workers were randomised in 36 sites in Australia, the Netherlands, Spain, the United Kingdom and Brazil, to receive BCG-Denmark or no BCG (1:1 ratio using a web-based procedure) and followed for 12 months with 3-monthly questionnaires. Exclusion criteria included contraindication to BCG vaccine or previous vaccination with BCG within the past year, any other live-attenuated vaccine within the last month, or any COVID-specific vaccine. The intervention group received one intradermal dose of 0.1 mL of BCG-Denmark corresponding to 2–8 x 10 5 colony forming units of Mycobacterium bovis, Danish strain 1331. The primary outcome was the difference in restricted mean survival time (i.e., time to first cold-sore recurrence), in participants with frequent recurrent herpes labialis (≥ 4 recurrences/year), analysed by intention-to-treat. Secondary outcomes addressed additional questions, including analyses in other sub-populations. Adverse events were monitored closely during the first 3 months and were reported in all participants who received one dose of study drug according to intervention received. The BRACE trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04327206.

Findings

Between March 30, 2020 and February 18, 2021, 84 individuals with frequent recurrent cold sores were randomly assigned to BCG (n = 38) or control (n = 46). The average time to first cold-sore recurrence was 1.55 months longer in the BCG group (95% CI 0.27–2.82, p = 0.02) than the control group (hazard ratio 0.54, 95% CI 0.32–0.91; intention-to-treat). The beneficial effect of BCG was greater in the as-treated population (difference 1.91 months, 95% CI 0.69–3.12, p = 0.003; hazard ratio 0.45, 95% CI 0.26–0.76). In prespecified subgroup analyses, only sex modified the treatment effect (interaction p = 0.007), with benefit restricted to males. Over 12 months, a greater proportion of participants in the BCG group compared with the control group reported a decrease in duration (61% vs 21%), severity (74% vs 21%), frequency (55% vs 21%), and impact on quality of life (42% vs 15%) of cold sore recurrences. In participants who had ever had a cold sore, there was also a decrease in self-reported burden of recurrences in the BCG group. In participants who had never had a cold sore, there was an increased risk of a first episode in the BCG group (risk difference 1.4%; 95% CI 0.3–2.6%, p = 0.02). There were no safety concerns.

Interpretation

BCG-Denmark vaccination had a beneficial effect on herpes labialis, particularly in males with frequent recurrences, but may increase the risk of a first cold sore.

### Pulmonary procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic: a work group report of the AAAAI asthma diagnosis and treatment (ADT) interest section [^112uPcBk]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2022). High credibility.

Pulmonary procedures — overview of factors affecting all procedures states that risk assessment is a complex multifactorial process and that the risk of COVID-19 transmission should be viewed from the perspective of the community, the individual patient, and the specific pulmonary procedure, with the composite summary risk of the elements currently not fully defined. Community considerations note that risk assessment should begin with understanding the transmission risk in the local population and that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) divides the risk of transmission into 4 categories: high, substantial, moderate, and low, with categories based on a 1-week running composite of new cases per 100,000 and percentage of positive nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs), and that the CDC provides updated community transmission levels by county. Transmission risks should be used as a part of a composite with other considerations to assist in selecting appropriate levels of risk reduction strategies; when there is substantial or high risk of transmission in the community, the risk of asymptomatic spread is also elevated and it would be less effective to rely on symptom-based and exposure screening, even in vaccinated patients, whereas if the community transmission levels are low, symptom-based and exposure screening in vaccinated patients might be acceptable for selected encounters; higher community transmission rates suggest emphasis on postponement of procedures and/or stricter risk reduction strategies. Patient considerations indicate that the risk of transmission for individual patients should be assessed before and at every visit; vaccinated patients are at significantly lower risk for transmission, whereas unvaccinated patients are at higher risk; patients with symptoms of possible COVID-19 infection and/or known exposures to COVID-19 in the prior 2 weeks are at higher risk and should have their office visit postponed and recommended to quarantine; the CDC list of COVID-19–associated symptoms includes fever, chills, cough, shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache, new loss of taste or smell, sore throat, congested or runny nose, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea; and in select circumstances, if the patient were afebrile, had a negative COVID-19 NAAT, had only chronic respiratory symptoms, and otherwise fit the criteria to leave quarantine (onset of symptoms > 10 days prior, afebrile for > 24 hours, and symptoms improving), then pursuing an office visit and possible pulmonary testing would likely be lower risk.

### Cold-water immersion (cryotherapy) for preventing and treating muscle soreness after exercise [^116zicUC]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Many strategies are in use with the intention of preventing or minimising delayed onset muscle soreness and fatigue after exercise. Cold-water immersion, in water temperatures of less than 15°C, is currently one of the most popular interventional strategies used after exercise.

Objectives

To determine the effects of cold-water immersion in the management of muscle soreness after exercise.

Search Methods

In February 2010, we searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library (2010, Issue 1), MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health (CINAHL), British Nursing Index and archive (BNI), and the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro). We also searched the reference lists of articles, handsearched journals and conference proceedings and contacted experts. In November 2011, we updated the searches of CENTRAL (2011, Issue 4), MEDLINE (up to November Week 3 2011), EMBASE (to 2011 Week 46) and CINAHL (to 28 November 2011) to check for more recent publications.

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised trials comparing the effect of using cold-water immersion after exercise with: passive intervention (rest/no intervention), contrast immersion, warm-water immersion, active recovery, compression, or a different duration/dosage of cold-water immersion. Primary outcomes were pain (muscle soreness) or tenderness (pain on palpation), and subjective recovery (return to previous activities without signs or symptoms).

Data Collection and Analysis

Three authors independently evaluated study quality and extracted data. Some of the data were obtained following author correspondence or extracted from graphs in the trial reports. Where possible, data were pooled using the fixed-effect model.

Main Results

Seventeen small trials were included, involving a total of 366 participants. Study quality was low. The temperature, duration and frequency of cold-water immersion varied between the different trials as did the exercises and settings. The majority of studies failed to report active surveillance of pre-defined adverse events. Fourteen studies compared cold-water immersion with passive intervention. Pooled results for muscle soreness showed statistically significant effects in favour of cold-water immersion after exercise at 24 hour (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.55, 95% CI -0.84 to -0.27; 10 trials), 48 hour (SMD -0.66, 95% CI -0.97 to -0.35; 8 trials), 72 hour (SMD -0.93; 95% CI -1.36 to -0.51; 4 trials) and 96 hour (SMD -0.58; 95% CI -1.00 to -0.16; 5 trials) follow-ups. These results were heterogeneous. Exploratory subgroup analyses showed that studies using cross-over designs or running based exercises showed significantly larger effects in favour of cold-water immersion. Pooled results from two studies found cold-water immersion groups had significantly lower ratings of fatigue (MD -1.70; 95% CI -2.49 to -0.90; 10 units scale, best to worst), and potentially improved ratings of physical recovery (MD 0.97; 95% CI -0.10 to 2.05; 10 units scale, worst to best) immediately after the end of cold-water immersion. Five studies compared cold-water with contrast immersion. Pooled data for pain showed no evidence of differences between the two groups at four follow-up times (immediately, 24, 48 and 72 hours after treatment). Similar findings for pooled analyses at 24, 48 and 72 hour follow-ups applied to the four studies comparing cold-water with warm-water immersion. Single trials only compared cold-water immersion with respectively active recovery, compression and a second dose of cold-water immersion at 24 hours.

Authors' Conclusions

There was some evidence that cold-water immersion reduces delayed onset muscle soreness after exercise compared with passive interventions involving rest or no intervention. There was insufficient evidence to conclude on other outcomes or for other comparisons. The majority of trials did not undertake active surveillance of pre-defined adverse events. High quality, well reported research in this area is required.

### Treatment with a novel topical nanoemulsion (NB-001) speeds time to healing of recurrent cold sores [^116zpWRV]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Current topical therapies for cold sores are only marginally beneficial due to poor skin penetration. We assessed the safety and efficacy of a novel topical antiviral nanoemulsion (NB-001) with high tissue bioavailability.

Objectives

The primary endpoint was the time to lesion healing.

Methods

482 subjects with recurrent cold sores were randomized to self-initiate treatment with either vehicle or NB-001 (0.1%, 0.3% or 0.5%) at the first signs or symptoms of a cold sore episode. Lotion was applied 5 times per day, approximately 3 to 4 hours apart, for 4 days. Time to lesion healing was correlated with NB-001 bioavailability determined in human cadaver skin.

Results

Subjects treated with 0.3% NB-001 showed a 1.3-day improvement in the mean time to healing compared to vehicle (P = 0.006). This was consistent with human cadaver skin data indicating that the 0.3% nanoemulsion had the highest bioavailability, compared to 0.1% and 0.5% emulsions. No significant safety or dermal irritation concerns or systemic absorption were noted with any of the doses.

Conclusions

Topical NB-001 (0.3%) was well tolerated and highly efficacious in shortening the time to healing of cold sores. The improvement in time to healing was similar to that reported for oral nucleoside analogues, but without systemic exposure. Topical agents for recurrent herpes labialis (cold sores) reduce healing time by one half day, compared to oral therapies that speed healing by a day or more. A topical antiviral nanoemulsion was well tolerated and improved cold sore healing time by over a day compared to vehicle control. Nanoemulsion (NB-001) could represent a more efficacious topical treatment for recurrent cold sores.

Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements.

How should I use ZOVIRAX Cream?

Use ZOVIRAX Cream exactly as your healthcare provider tells you to use it.
Use ZOVIRAX Cream as soon as you have the first symptoms of a cold sore such as itching, redness, burning or tingling, or when the cold sore appears.
Wash your hands with soap and water before and after applying ZOVIRAX Cream.
The affected area should be clean and dry before applying ZOVIRAX Cream.
Apply ZOVIRAX Cream to the affected area 5 times each day for 4 days, including the outer edge.
You should not apply other skin products to the affected area during treatment with ZOVIRAX Cream.
Avoid unnecessary rubbing of the cold sore because this may cause the cold sore to spread to other areas around your mouth or make your cold sore worse.

What are the possible side effects of ZOVIRAX Cream?

The most common side effects of ZOVIRAX Cream are skin reactions at the treatment site and may include: dry or cracked lips, peeling, flaking or dryness of the skin, a burning or stinging feeling, and itching.

### Vaccines for the common cold [^113jmjXx]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The common cold is a spontaneously remitting infection of the upper respiratory tract, characterised by a runny nose, nasal congestion, sneezing, cough, malaise, sore throat, and fever (usually < 37.8 ºC). Whilst the common cold is generally not harmful, it is a cause of economic burden due to school and work absenteeism. In the United States, economic loss due to the common cold is estimated at more than USD 40 billion per year, including an estimate of 70 million workdays missed by employees, 189 million school days missed by children, and 126 million workdays missed by parents caring for children with a cold. Additionally, data from Europe show that the total cost per episode may be up to EUR 1102. There is also a large expenditure due to inappropriate antimicrobial prescription. Vaccine development for the common cold has been difficult due to antigenic variability of the common cold viruses; even bacteria can act as infective agents. Uncertainty remains regarding the efficacy and safety of interventions for preventing the common cold in healthy people, thus we performed an update of this Cochrane Review, which was first published in 2011 and updated in 2013 and 2017.

Objectives

To assess the clinical effectiveness and safety of vaccines for preventing the common cold in healthy people.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (April 2022), MEDLINE (1948 to April 2022), Embase (1974 to April 2022), CINAHL (1981 to April 2022), and LILACS (1982 to April 2022). We also searched three trials registers for ongoing studies, and four websites for additional trials (April 2022). We did not impose any language or date restrictions.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of any virus vaccine compared with placebo to prevent the common cold in healthy people.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used Cochrane's Screen4Me workflow to assess the initial search results. Four review authors independently performed title and abstract screening to identify potentially relevant studies. We retrieved the full-text articles for those studies deemed potentially relevant, and the review authors independently screened the full-text reports for inclusion in the review, recording reasons for exclusion of the excluded studies. Any disagreements were resolved by discussion or by consulting a third review author when needed. Two review authors independently collected data on a data extraction form, resolving any disagreements by consensus or by involving a third review author. We double-checked data transferred into Review Manager 5 software. Three review authors independently assessed risk of bias using RoB 1 tool as outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. We carried out statistical analysis using Review Manager 5. We did not conduct a meta-analysis, and we did not assess publication bias. We used GRADEpro GDT software to assess the certainty of the evidence and to create a summary of findings table. MAIN RESULTS: We did not identify any new RCTs for inclusion in this update. This review includes one RCT conducted in 1965 with an overall high risk of bias. The RCT included 2307 healthy young men in a military facility, all of whom were included in the analyses, and compared the effect of three adenovirus vaccines (live, inactivated type 4, and inactivated type 4 and 7) against a placebo (injection of physiological saline or gelatin capsule). There were 13 (1.14%) events in 1139 participants in the vaccine group, and 14 (1.19%) events in 1168 participants in the placebo group. Overall, we do not know if there is a difference between the adenovirus vaccine and placebo in reducing the incidence of the common cold (risk ratio 0.95, 95% confidence interval 0.45 to 2.02; very low-certainty evidence). Furthermore, no difference in adverse events when comparing live vaccine preparation with placebo was reported. We downgraded the certainty of the evidence to very low due to unclear risk of bias, indirectness because the population of this study was only young men, and imprecision because confidence intervals were wide and the number of events was low. The included study did not assess vaccine-related or all-cause mortality. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: This Cochrane Review was based on one study with very low-certainty evidence, which showed that there may be no difference between the adenovirus vaccine and placebo in reducing the incidence of the common cold. We identified a need for well-designed, adequately powered RCTs to investigate vaccines for the common cold in healthy people. Future trials on interventions for preventing the common cold should assess a variety of virus vaccines for this condition, and should measure such outcomes as common cold incidence, vaccine safety, and mortality (all-cause and related to the vaccine).

### Treatment of the common cold [^1151CgAt]. American Family Physician (2019). Medium credibility.

Acute upper respiratory tract infections are extremely common in adults and children, but only a few safe and effective treatments are available. Patients typically present with nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, sore throat, cough, general malaise, and/or low-grade fever. Informing patients about the self-limited nature of the common cold can help manage expectations, limit antibiotic use, and avoid over-the-counter purchases that may not help. Treatments with proven effectiveness for cold symptoms in adults include over-the-counter analgesics, zinc, nasal decongestants with or without antihistamines, and ipratropium for cough. Lower-quality evidence suggests that Lactobacillus casei may be beneficial in older adults. The only established safe and effective treatments for children are acetylcysteine, honey (for children one year and older), nasal saline irrigation, intranasal ipratropium, and topical application of ointment containing camphor, menthol, and eucalyptus oils. Over-the-counter cold medications should not be used in children younger than four years. Counseling patients about the importance of good hand hygiene is the best way to prevent transmission of cold viruses.

### Valacyclovir hydrochloride (Valtrex) [^1118JZTY]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Patient Information).

Importance of Adequate Hydration

Patients should be advised to maintain adequate hydration.

Missed Dose

Instruct patients that if they miss a dose of VALTREX, to take it as soon as they remember. Advise patients not to double their next dose or take more than the prescribed dose.

Cold Sores (Herpes Labialis)

Patients should be advised to initiate treatment at the earliest symptom of a cold sore (e.g., tingling, itching, or burning). There are no data on the effectiveness of treatment initiated after the development of clinical signs of a cold sore (e.g., papule, vesicle, or ulcer). Patients should be instructed that treatment for cold sores should not exceed 1 day (2 doses) and that their doses should be taken about 12 hours apart. Patients should be informed that VALTREX is not a cure for cold sores.

Genital Herpes

Patients should be informed that VALTREX is not a cure for genital herpes. Because genital herpes is a sexually transmitted disease, patients should avoid contact with lesions or intercourse when lesions and/or symptoms are present to avoid infecting partners. Genital herpes is frequently transmitted in the absence of symptoms through asymptomatic viral shedding. Therefore, patients should be counseled to use safer sex practices in combination with suppressive therapy with VALTREX. Sex partners of infected persons should be advised that they might be infected even if they have no symptoms. Type‑specific serologic testing of asymptomatic partners of persons with genital herpes can determine whether risk for HSV‑2 acquisition exists.

### Structural analysis of herpes simplex virus by optical super-resolution imaging [^113RpHTM]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The Herpesviridae comprise a large family of enveloped DNA viruses that infect a wide range of hosts, including humans. One of the most widespread human members of this family, herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1), is a common cause of cold sores but can also result in herpes keratitis, a leading infectious cause of blindness, and herpes simplex encephalitis, which has a high mortality even in patients treated with antiviral therapy. It is highly contagious and can be easily passed from individual to individual via direct contact. In addition, after primary infection, HSV-1 establishes a lifelong latent infection in sensory ganglia with periodic reactivation of the virus leading to both symptomatic and asymptomatic virus shedding.

Electron microscopy (EM) and electron tomography (ET) studies of HSV-1 have revealed that virus particles have a spherical shape, with diameter ranging from 155 to 240 nm, each containing an icosahedral capsid with a diameter of 125 nm, which contains the viral DNA. The structure of the highly ordered capsid complex has been studied extensively and is now well defined. A partially ordered layer of tegument proteins surrounds the nucleocapsid and the viral envelope encloses the nucleocapsid/tegument core. The envelope carries a set of glycoproteins that are essential for virus entry and viral morphogenesis. Among them, glycoprotein D (gD) mediates interactions with cellular receptors and initiates the cascade of events essential for HSV-1 entry into target cells. The tegument is the most structurally complex layer of the virus, and so far, over 20 tegument proteins have been identified for HSV-1. In particular, VP1/2 (also known as pUL36) is the largest tegument protein (> 330 kDa) and is essential for HSV-1 entry and assembly. Owing to the interaction of its carboxy terminus with the minor capsid protein pUL25, VP1/2 is often referred to as being a part of the inner tegument. With its binding partner pUL37 (refs,), VP1/2 plays an essential role in capsid transport on microtubules. In contrast to VP1/2 and pUL37, one of the major tegument proteins VP16 is thought to reside closer to the viral envelope and be a part of the outer tegument. VP16 also interacts with VP1/2 (ref.) and induces transcription of immediate-early viral genes, thus playing an important role in the viral life cycle. Owing to its multiple interactions with other viral proteins, VP16 has been proposed to serve as a central organizer for the tegument.

### SARS-CoV-2 cold-chain transmission: characteristics, risks, and strategies [^113kPZQJ]. Journal of Medical Virology (2022). Medium credibility.

6 CONCLUSION

The cold‐chain related outbreaks of COVID‐19 in China provides persuasive evidence that cold‐chain products and packaging act as the carrier to introduce SARS‐CoV‐2 that cause local transmission in the ports, cold storage or seafood markets, and even leading to community outbreak if without well‐controlled. The international community should pay close attention to the SARS‐CoV‐2 cold‐chain transmission, strengthen the disinfection of cold‐chain products and the personnel protective measures in aspect of the production, processing, transportation and sale of cold‐chain products, preventing SARS‐CoV‐2 reintroduced or silent transmission by cold‐chain.

In their initial explanations, when asked what they know about COVID-19, health center staff described COVID-19 scientifically, discussing it as a disease caused by a virus or infection, noting that it affects the respiratory system and is transmissible, with multiple respondents specifically explaining that transmission occurs through respiratory droplets. Many noted when and where the virus originated and/or that it has spread worldwide. CBVs and community members provided a simpler description of COVID-19, calling it a disease or virus, noting that it is dangerous and that it can be deadly but that it is preventable, with many mentioning its transmissibility and modes of transmission. Many respondents immediately began describing prevention methods outlined in the MoH guidelines. Illustrative quotes are included below:

"COVID-19 is a respiratory tract infection which is transmitted or contracted through droplets, handshakes and if you are found in a crowded area you can easily get it". – Health center staff, female, Pemba district, round 1

"[People] say COVID-19 is a vicious disease which has killed so many people. So, we are told on how we are supposed to protect ourselves… " – Community member, female, Kalomo district, round 2

Coughing was widely discussed as a main symptom of COVID-19 by all respondent groups, along with three other main symptoms: fever, difficulty breathing, and nasal symptoms. Some respondents also discussed fatigue and body weakness, headache, sore throat, body or muscle pains, and chest pain as symptoms of COVID-19. Loss of taste and/or smell was rarely mentioned by any respondent group. A few illustrative quotes are included below:

"If someone contracted COVID-19, they will have fever, cough, sneezing, sore throat and at times general body pains as well". – Health center staff, male, Nyimba district, round 1

"According to what we were taught, if you experience difficulty in breathing, coughing… have flu and feeling tiredness all the time. These are the signs they showed that this could be coronavirus". – Community member, male, Kalomo district, round 2

Chemical cold packs and ice packs — Limited studies show no benefit in heat reduction with traditional placement of ice or chemical cold packs over major vessels; ice packs have greater cooling capacity than chemical cold packs and, if used, are most efficacious when wet and covering the entire body; in a small translational study, chemical cold packs applied to the palms, soles, and cheeks showed twice the cooling rate compared to traditional major-vessel placements; Recommendations: If ice packs are used, we recommend applying them to cover the entire body (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence). If too few ice packs are available to cover the entire body, we recommend they be applied to the cheeks, palms, and soles rather than the skin covering the major vessels (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence).

### SHEA practice update: infection prevention and control (IPC) in residential facilities for pediatric patients and their families [^116q5VRn]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2024). High credibility.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) in pediatric family-centered residential facilities — entry, restriction, and education are outlined as follows: HSV remains in the body after first infection and reactivation is common, and transmission occurs through contact with infected sores or contaminated secretions with no vaccine available. Individuals with isolated labial cold sores may be allowed entry if capable of frequent hand hygiene and can follow instructions not to kiss others; if young or incapable of hand hygiene, they should not be admitted unless the sore is completely crusted and dry, and if permitting entry they should be restricted to their private room until the rash is completely crusted and dry. Restrict those with primary herpes gingivostomatitis with active sores and drooling from entering the facility and, once recovered, require written medical clearance stating the patient is no longer contagious. Allow exposed individuals without symptoms of illness to stay without restriction, and educate families on frequent hand hygiene, avoidance of sharing personal items, prompt removal and careful handling of potentially contaminated items, and advise families to avoid direct, close contact with rashes to prevent person-to-person transmission.

### Practice of COVID-19 preventive measures and its associated factors among students in Ghana [^115SxqAP]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

Predictor variables.

We explored variables of interest that included knowledge of COVID-19 symptoms, knowledge of COVID-19 mode of transmission, knowledge on COVID-19 preventive measures, and whether an educational/training program was a source of information about COVID-19.

With regard to knowledge of COVID-19 symptoms, we compared students who knew one or more symptoms of COVID-19 (fever, dry cough, body aches, tiredness, diarrhea, sore throat, nasal congestion, conjunctivitis, headache, loss of taste or smell, and rash on fingers or toes) with students who did not know any of the symptoms.

On mode of transmission of COVID-19, we compared students who reported that COVID-19 can be transmitted via droplets from the nose or mouth of an infected person with students who reported that this was not a transmission route. A comparison was also made on students who reported that COVID-19 can be transmitted by touching droplets on surface or objects from an infected person with students who reported that this was not a transmission route. We also compared students who reported that an infected asymptomatic person can transmit the virus with students who reported otherwise. Students who reported that COVID-19 can be transmitted among adolescents and young adults were also compared with students who reported that transmission was not possible.

On knowledge about COVID-19 preventive measures, we compared students who reported that avoiding crowdedness in public places can prevent infection with COVID-19 with students who reported that it was not a preventive measure. Students who reported that covering the nose and mouth while coughing can prevent COVID-19 were also compared with students who reported that it was not a preventive measure. We also compared students who reported that avoiding the touching of the eyes, nose, and mouth can prevent infection with COVID-19 with students who reported otherwise. Students who reported that COVID-19 was not deadly and there was no need for preventive measures were compared with students who reported that the virus was deadly.

Students who reported they had heard about COVID-19 via an educational or training program were compared with students who did not hear about it through an educational/training program.

### The common cold [^11784iaW]. Lancet (2003). Excellent credibility.

Despite great advances in medicine, the common cold continues to be a great burden on society in terms of human suffering and economic losses. Of the several viruses that cause the disease, the role of rhinoviruses is most prominent. About a quarter of all colds are still without proven cause, and the recent discovery of human metapneumovirus suggests that other viruses could remain undiscovered. Research into the inflammatory mechanisms of the common cold has elucidated the complexity of the virus-host relation. Increasing evidence is also available for the central role of viruses in predisposing to complications. New antivirals for the treatment of colds are being developed, but optimum use of these agents would require rapid detection of the specific virus causing the infection. Although vaccines against many respiratory viruses could also become available, the ultimate prevention of the common cold seems to remain a distant aim.

### Causal associations between prodromal infection and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder: a mendelian randomization study [^116fH5W3]. European Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

Prodromal infections are associated with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD), but it remains unclear which type of infection has a causal association with NMOSD. We aimed to explore the causal associations between four herpesvirus infections (chickenpox, cold sores, mononucleosis and shingles) and NMOSD, as well as between other types of infections and NMOSD.

Methods

For data on infections, we used the genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics from the 23andMe cohort. For outcomes, we used the GWAS data of participants of European ancestry, including 215 NMOSD patients (132 anti-aquaporin-4 antibody [AQP4-ab]-positive patients and 83 AQP4-ab-negative patients) and 1244 normal controls. Single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) identification and two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses were then performed.

Results

In the 23andMe cohort, we identified one SNP for chickenpox (rs9266089 in HLA-B gene), one SNP for cold scores (rs885950 in the POU5F1 gene), one SNP for mononucleosis (rs2596465 in the HCP5 gene), and three SNPs for shingles (rs2523591 in the HLA-B gene; rs7047299 in the IFNA21 gene; rs9260809 in the MICD gene). The association between cold sores and AQP4-ab-positive NMOSD reached statistical significance (odds ratio [OR] 745.318; 95% confidence interval [CI] 22.176, 25,049.53 [p < 0.001, Q < 0.001]). The association between shingles and AQP4-ab-positive NMOSD was also statistically significant (OR 21.073; 95% CI 4.271, 103.974 [p < 0.001, Q < 0.001]). No significant association was observed between other infections and AQP4-ab-positive or AQP4-ab-negative NMOSD.

Conclusion

These findings suggest there are positive associations between cold sores and shingles and AQP4-ab-positive NMOSD, indicating there may be causal links between herpes simplex virus and varicella-zoster virus infection and AQP4-ab-positive NMOSD.

### Early treatment of cold sores with topical ME-609 decreases the frequency of ulcerative lesions: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, patient-initiated clinical trial [^111FDGPm]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Prior pilot studies support the use of antiviral medications with topical corticosteroids for herpes simplex labialis (HSL). ME-609 (Xerese, Xerclear) is a combination of 5% acyclovir and 1% hydrocortisone developed for the topical treatment of HSL.

Objectives

The primary study end point was the prevention of ulcerative HSL lesions.

Methods

In all, 2437 patients with a history of HSL were randomized to self-initiate treatment with ME-609, 5% acyclovir in ME-609 vehicle, or ME-609 vehicle (placebo) at the earliest sign of a cold sore recurrence. Cream was applied 5 times/d for 5 days. A total of 1443 patients experienced a recurrence and initiated treatment with ME-609 (n = 601), acyclovir (n = 610), or placebo (n = 232).

Results

Of patients receiving ME-609, 42% did not develop an ulcerative lesion compared with 35% of patients receiving acyclovir in ME-609 vehicle (P = 0.014) and 26% of patients receiving placebo (P < .0001). In patients with ulcerative lesions, healing times were reduced in the ME-609 and acyclovir groups compared with placebo (P < .01 for both). The cumulative lesion area for all lesions was reduced 50% in patients receiving ME-609 compared with the placebo group (P < .0001). There were no differences among groups in the number of patients with positive herpes simplex virus cultures. The side-effect profile was similar among treatments.

Limitations

The study did not contain a group treated with a topical corticosteroid alone.

Conclusions

ME-609 prevented progression of cold sores to ulcerative lesions and significantly reduced the cumulative lesion area compared with acyclovir and placebo. ME-609 treatment offers additional therapeutic benefit compared with therapy with topical acyclovir alone.

### Non-pharmaceutical interventions for pandemic influenza, international measures [^114Jo1b3]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Viral Shedding and Transmission by Infected Persons without Symptoms

During the incubation period, persons with presymptomatic influenza infection shed virus at lower titers than persons with symptoms (Table A1); however, the infectiousness of those with presymptomatic infection has not been studied. Apparently the only published report implicating transmission during the incubation period involves a group of adults in New Zealand in 1991. Of 26 adults who bagged fertilizer for 8 h, influenzalike illness (fever, headache, sore throat, myalgia, respiratory symptoms) developed in 16 and mild, "cold-like" illnesses developed in 3 persons within 24 to 48 h after working with the fertilizer. A person considered to be the probable index patient had felt unwell during work, although he did not have respiratory symptoms; an influenzalike illness began to develop 6 h after he finished work. Influenza A virus H1N1 was isolated from 2 symptomatic persons; whether these included the suspected index patient and whether that person transmitted infection during an incubation period or the cluster resulted from community exposure are unknown. The group shared drinking bottles and worked in a dusty environment, both of which could have facilitated transmission.

Large-Droplet and Aerosol Respiratory Transmission

Animal studies and most influenza outbreaks among humans suggest that virus-laden large droplets (particles > 5 mm in diameter) generated when infected persons cough or sneeze are the predominant mechanism of influenza virus transmission. However, evidence for aerosol spread (especially in unventilated conditions) is available. Although a direct comparison has not been made, experimental studies suggest that the infectious dose for humans exposed by aerosol is lower than that seen with experimental nasopharyngeal instillation. The precise proportion of infections transmitted by large droplets versus aerosols is difficult to assess and likely depends on the setting but is relevant when developing recommendations on mask use. Data do not exist to quantify the relative efficacy of surgical masks versus respirators in preventing influenza infections in exposed persons, but surgical masks should protect against large droplets, believed to be the major mode of transmission.

14.1 Cold Sores (Herpes Labialis)

Two double‑blind, placebo‑controlled clinical trials were conducted in 1,856 healthy adults and adolescents (aged greater than or equal to 12 years) with a history of recurrent cold sores. Subjects self‑initiated therapy at the earliest symptoms and prior to any signs of a cold sore. The majority of subjects initiated treatment within 2 hours of onset of symptoms. Subjects were randomized to VALTREX 2 grams twice daily on Day 1 followed by placebo on Day 2, VALTREX 2 grams twice daily on Day 1 followed by 1 gram twice daily on Day 2, or placebo on Days 1 and 2.

The mean duration of cold sore episodes was about 1 day shorter in treated subjects as compared with placebo. The 2-day regimen did not offer additional benefit over the 1-day regimen.

No significant difference was observed between subjects receiving VALTREX or placebo in the prevention of progression of cold sore lesions beyond the papular stage.

14.2 Genital Herpes Infections

Initial Episode

Six hundred forty-three immunocompetent adults with first-episode genital herpes who presented within 72 hours of symptom onset were randomized in a double-blind trial to receive 10 days of VALTREX 1 gram twice daily (n = 323) or oral acyclovir 200 mg 5 times a day (n = 320). For both treatment groups the median time to lesion healing was 9 days, the median time to cessation of pain was 5 days, and the median time to cessation of viral shedding was 3 days.

Recurrent Episodes

Three double-blind trials (2 of them placebo-controlled) in immunocompetent adults with recurrent genital herpes were conducted. Subjects self-initiated therapy within 24 hours of the first sign or symptom of a recurrent genital herpes episode.

In 1 trial, subjects were randomized to receive 5 days of treatment with either VALTREX 500 mg twice daily (n = 360) or placebo (n = 259). The median time to lesion healing was 4 days in the group receiving VALTREX 500 mg versus 6 days in the placebo group, and the median time to cessation of viral shedding in subjects with at least 1 positive culture (42% of the overall trial population) was 2 days in the group receiving VALTREX 500 mg versus 4 days in the placebo group. The median time to cessation of pain was 3 days in the group receiving VALTREX 500 mg versus 4 days in the placebo group. Results supporting efficacy were replicated in a second trial.

### SARS-CoV-2 cold-chain transmission: characteristics, risks, and strategies [^112BYktg]. Journal of Medical Virology (2022). Medium credibility.

5 UNDERLYING RISKS AND PREVENTIVE STRATEGIES OF SARS‐COV‐2 TRANSMISSION BY COLD‐CHAIN PRODUCTS

According to the analysis of the six cold‐chain related COVID‐19 outbreaks in China, the imported cold chain products is one of the important causes for the recurrence of COVID‐19. There are two underlying risks to the cold‐chain fomite transmission for prevention and control of the COVID‐19 epidemic. One is cold‐chain fomite including the rapid international logistics under low temperature will greatly accelerate the global spread of SARS‐CoV‐2, especially in areas where the COVID‐19 epidemic is well controlled. The other is "old strains" circulating in the past that stored in cold storage could be reactivated, causing "silent transmission" and triggering new COVID‐19 outbreaks, and the later may further affect the evolutional process of SARS‐CoV‐2 and pose a threat to future prevention and control as well as immunization strategies. Therefore, formulating a comprehensive prevention strategy to deal with the localized outbreak epidemic at any time should be considered as a priority for public authorities worldwide.

China has gradually improved the prevention and control strategies,: (I) Strengthening the sampling inspection of imported cold‐chain products to find the source of infection in a timely manner; (II) Developing disinfectant and disinfection equipment in low‐temperature to comprehensively disinfect imported cold‐chain products and cut off transmission routes; (III) Enhancing vaccination, personal protection training and health monitoring for the protection of high‐risk population; (IV) Developing the technical guidelines for ranking and classifying SARS‐CoV‐2 contaminated cold‐chain foods; (V) Improving the sampling strategies for tracing the cold‐chain source. Indeed, following the first Dalian COVID‐19 outbreak in July 2020, the cold‐chain related outbreaks in China were limited to the cities importing cold chain products and did not spread to other provinces. However, with tens of millions of imported cold‐chain products in China, it is not realistic to completely block the introduction of SARS‐COV‐2, but the implementation of these strategies will minimize the introduction and prevalence of the virus.

### Bacillus calmette-Guérin vaccination for protection against recurrent herpes labialis: a nested randomised controlled trial [^115MUVYo]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Outcome measures

Questionnaires were completed by participants at baseline and at 3, 6, 9, and 12-months of follow-up. In the baseline questionnaire, participants were asked demographic questions (including sex) and details about their previous history of cold sores, including age at first episode, number of cold sore episodes (overall and in the last year), use of treatment for cold sores, and impact of cold sores on quality of life. In the follow-up questionnaires, participants were asked whether they had had a cold sore recurrence since their last completed questionnaire, the frequency of episodes, when the first recurrence began, any treatment used for cold sores, and whether they noticed a change in cold sore recurrences in terms of frequency, duration, severity, and impact on quality of life.

The primary outcome for this nested study was the time from randomisation to first self-reported cold sore recurrence in the subset of participants with frequent recurrent herpes labialis, defined as reporting four or more cold sore recurrences in the preceding year at the baseline questionnaire. Secondary outcomes included the number of cold sore recurrences, proportion of participants with a cold sore recurrence, and proportion of participants with a perceived change in duration, severity, frequency, or impact on quality of life of cold sore recurrences (see Appendix).

### Thoughts on COVID-19 and autoimmune diseases [^111w9rws]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

In a time of uncertainty, where fake news easily becomes 'reality', the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic poses a great challenge to physicians and their at-risk patients. While information steadily streams in through all possible news and social media channels, physicians and the scientific community are in a unique position to advise, caution and comfort their patients. The lupus landscape has always required navigating unique challenges, and the COVID-19 pandemic is no different. So, what should patients with lupus, many of whom are immunosuppressed by the illness per se and the medications used to treat it, do to prepare for and combat this novel coronavirus, and what should their doctors tell them about the virus, and accompanying news scares, that are rapidly disseminating through the internet?

Over the 2 months since coronavirus first emerged in China, the US medical system has remained more watchful than actionable, but now that cases have emerged on every continent, it is clear that it is only a matter of time before every country and major urban centre will be affected. Data suggest a highly contagious viral illness with a mortality rate approaching 2%, echoing the Spanish flu of 1918. As of 8 March 2020, the WHO reported over 100 000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 globally. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported 423 cases of COVID-19 in the USA across 35 states, with 19 deaths. Is the US medical system ready?

Coronaviruses are a family of viruses, including the common cold, which typically cause mild to moderate upper respiratory tract symptoms. These viruses are zoonotic, often originally circulating among animals; they occasionally spill over to humans through contact. There are currently seven coronaviruses known to cause human disease, three of which (severe acute respiratory syndrome, Middle East respiratory syndrome and COVID-19) are known to cause moderate to severe disease in humans. Similar to other coronaviruses, COVID-19 has an incubation period of 2–14 days and causes fever, fatigue, cough and shortness of breath, but it may also progress to more severe respiratory illness. Additionally, many of those infected with the virus may never show any symptoms at all. These individuals are contagious despite being clinically asymptomatic, which contributes to the spread of disease. COVID-19 was initially thought to be solely transmitted through respiratory shedding; however, COVID-19 has also been found in anal swabs suggesting an additional oral–faecal route of transmission.

### New Zealand school children's perspectives on influenza: listening to young voices in respiratory health [^112by9DB]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Children play a crucial role in the transmission of influenza, yet their understanding of the virus and its prevention is often overlooked in public health messaging. This study aimed to explore, in the post COVID-19 pandemic era, children's perceptions of influenza, with a focus on understanding their perspectives and giving a voice to their views on the illness.

Methods

Two focus groups were conducted in South Auckland, New Zealand, with a diverse sample of 27 children aged 5–13 years from two schools. Consent was obtained through parental approval and child assent. Using creative activities, including drawings and group discussions, children shared their understanding of influenza, its transmission, symptoms, and their views on non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) and vaccination. Data were analysed qualitatively to identify key themes and insights.

Results

While children generally recognise influenza as a severe illness with symptoms like fever, sore throat, and cough, a small proportion of younger children thought influenza was the same as common cold. Most children were aware of the airborne nature of transmission. Children showed strong awareness of how influenza impacts daily life, such as missing school and social events. Age-specific perceptions were evident in the drawings: younger children focused on symptoms, while older children had a broader view, including symptoms, transmission, prevention, and emotional and social impacts. Preferences for NPIs varied by age, with younger children emphasising coughing etiquette and older children prioritising handwashing and mask-wearing. Regarding vaccination, while children understood its protective role, many expressed fear of injections, preferring less invasive options like nasal sprays or patches.

Conclusion

Children's perceptions of influenza highlight both awareness and gaps in understanding, particularly regarding transmission and illness severity. Public health messaging that addresses both these strengths and gaps, while incorporating children's voices, could improve efforts to mitigate the impact of influenza and other respiratory illnesses. Strategies such as promoting alternative vaccination methods and reinforcing NPIs in a relatable way may enhance children's engagement with health behaviours, contributing to more effective influenza control in schools and communities.

### Valacyclovir hydrochloride (valacyclovir) [^112WNzuC]. FDA (2019). Medium credibility.

Valacyclovir tablets are used in children:

to treat cold sores (for children ≥ 12 years of age)
to treat chickenpox (for children 2 to < 18 years of age)

Valacyclovir tablets do not cure herpes infections (cold sores, chickenpox, shingles, or genital herpes).

The efficacy of valacyclovir tablets has not been studied in children who have not reached puberty.

What are cold sores, chickenpox, shingles, and genital herpes? Cold sores are caused by a herpes virus that may be spread by kissing or other physical contact with the infected area of the skin. They are small, painful ulcers that you get in or around your mouth. It is not known if valacyclovir tablets can stop the spread of cold sores to others.

Chickenpox is caused by a herpes virus. It causes an itchy rash of multiple small, red bumps that look like pimples or insect bites usually appearing first on the abdomen or back and face. It can spread to almost everywhere else on the body and may be accompanied by flu-like symptoms.

Shingles is caused by the same herpes virus that causes chickenpox. It causes small, painful blisters that happen on your skin. Shingles occurs in people who have already had chickenpox. Shingles can be spread to people who have not had chickenpox or the chickenpox vaccine by contact with the infected areas of the skin. It is not known if valacyclovir tablets can stop the spread of shingles to others.

### Clinics in dermatology: herpes simplex virus (update on dermatologic aspects of sexually transmitted disease and human immunodeficiency virus) [^117MDGu7]. Clinics in Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) is the most common cause of anogenital ulceration worldwide. There are two distinct viruses: HSV-1 associated with oro-labial cold sores and genital infection, and HSV-2 associated with genital infection. Infection is lifelong, and typically presents with painful anogenital ulceration which may recur after periods of latency. Asymptomatic shedding is common and may lead to transmission to sexual partners. Antiviral suppression with aciclovir, valaciclovir or famciclovir is useful to treat initial painful episodes, or troublesome recurrent infection. Suppressive antiviral therapy, condoms, selective abstinence and disclosure to sexual partners have all been demonstrated to reduce the risk of transmission.

### Bacillus calmette-Guérin vaccination for protection against recurrent herpes labialis: a nested randomised controlled trial [^115xLvYd]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This is the first RCT in which the efficacy of BCG vaccination to reduce cold sore recurrence is assessed. In individuals with frequent recurrent cold sore episodes, we found a 53% increase in the mean time spent without a recurrence over the 12 months following BCG vaccination, together with a decrease in the self-reported burden of cold sore recurrences. Although, participants in the BCG group were more likely to use oral therapy during follow up, a higher proportion of participants in the control group reported using it for a longer period, to prevent cold sores. BCG vaccination had the highest impact on individuals with frequent recurrent cold sore episodes. A decrease in cold sore burden was observed in participants with less frequent cold sore recurrences, but of lower magnitude. The effect of BCG on delaying time to first cold sore recurrence was greater in the as-treated population, supporting this being a true beneficial effect of the intervention.

Overall, the benefit of BCG vaccination was mainly qualitative (e.g. decreased severity of episode, lower impact of episode on quality of life), rather than quantitative (e.g. proportion of participant with a recurrence, number of recurrences). This highlights the need to include outcome measures that are clinically relevant in clinical trials, as even small changes, which may be difficult to capture with quantitative measures alone, can significantly impact individuals' everyday lives.

Previous observational studies reporting the impact of BCG vaccination on HSV have involved a total of 127 individuals with recurrent cold sores and 162 with recurrent herpes genitalis. In the two studies restricted to individuals with recurrent cold sores, nearly all participants benefitted from BCG vaccination, with 48% remaining recurrence-free and 45% clearly improving, with fewer or less severe recurrences.

### SARS-CoV-2 cold-chain transmission: characteristics, risks, and strategies [^1169ULb3]. Journal of Medical Virology (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Low temperature and certain humidity are conducive to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) for long‐time survival and long‐distance spread during logistics and trades. Contaminated cold‐chain or frozen products and outer packaging act as the carrier of SARS‐CoV‐2, that infects the high‐risk population who works in the ports, cold storage or seafood market. Since the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) pandemic worldwide, multiple localized outbreaks caused by SARS‐CoV‐2 contaminated imported cold‐chain products have been reported in China, which brought challenges to COVID‐19 prevention and control. Here, we review the evidences of SARS‐CoV‐2 cold‐chain transmission from six confirmed cold‐chain related COVID‐19 outbreaks in China, especially in terms of SARS‐CoV‐2 whole‐genome sequencing and virus isolation. In addition, we summarize the characteristics and mode of SARS‐CoV‐2 cold‐chain transmission from both six COVID‐19 outbreaks in China and the outbreaks suspected cold‐chain transmission in other countries. Finally, we analyze the underlying risks of SARS‐CoV‐2 cold‐chain transmission and propose the preventive countermeasures.

### SHEA practice update: infection prevention and control (IPC) in residential facilities for pediatric patients and their families [^117XrfTk]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Recommendations

Allow individuals who have isolated labial (lip) cold sores to enter the family-centered residential facility if they are capable of frequent hand hygiene and can follow instructions not to kiss others. If the person is young or incapable of hand hygiene, then restrict them from entrance until the cold sore is completely crusted and dry or restrict them to their private room.
Restrict individuals with active HSV affecting their skin or eyes from entering the facility until they have obtained written medical clearance from a licensed clinician. In general, the individual must be able to completely cover the rash with clothing, bandage(s), or other appropriate dressing. If the rash is unable to be completely covered, restrict entrance until the rash is completely crusted and dry. If permitting entry, restrict the individual to their private room until the rash is completely crusted and dry.
Restrict those with primary herpes gingivostomatitis (see 5.000000000000000e+00 above) from entering the facility if active sores and drooling are present. Once they have recovered from the illness, require written medical clearance from a licensed clinician that states that the patient is no longer contagious.
Allow individuals who have been exposed to a person who is infected with HSV who do not have symptoms of illness to stay at the facility without restriction.
Educate family members about the importance of frequent hand hygiene, avoidance of sharing personal items, and prompt removal and careful handling of potentially contaminated items (e.g. tissues, towels, and linens). Advise family to avoid direct, close contact with rashes to prevent person-to-person transmission.

### C21orf91 genotypes correlate with herpes simplex labialis (cold sore) frequency: description of a cold sore susceptibility gene [^112yAPSv]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) infects > 70% of the United States population. We identified a 3-megabase region on human chromosome 21 containing 6 candidate genes associated with herpes simplex labialis (HSL, "cold sores").

Methods

We conducted single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) scans of the chromosome 21 region to define which of 6 possible candidate genes were associated with cold sore frequency. We obtained the annual HSL frequency for 355 HSV-1 seropositive individuals and determined the individual genotypes by SNPlex for linkage analysis and parental transmission disequilibrium testing (ParenTDT).

Results

Two-point linkage analysis showed positive linkage between cold sore frequency and 2 SNPs within the C21orf91 region, 1 of which is nonsynonymous. ParenTDT analysis revealed a strong association between another C21orf91 SNP, predicted to lie in the 3' untranslated region, and frequent HSL (P = 0.0047). C21orf 91 is a predicted open reading frame of unknown function that encodes a cytosolic protein.

Conclusions

We evaluated candidate genes in the cold sore susceptibility region using fine mapping with 45 SNP markers. 2 complementary techniques identified C21orf91 as a gene of interest for susceptibility to HSL. We propose that C21orf91 be designated the Cold Sore Susceptibility Gene-1 (CSSG1).

### Respiratory illness in households of school-dismissed students during pandemic (H1N1) 2009 [^1114jT67]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

To the Editor: In response to the emergence of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued interim guidance for preventing spread of the pandemic virus in schools. Initial guidance recommended that dismissal of students be considered for schools with confirmed cases of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 infection. The guidance was subsequently revised to recommend monitoring for respiratory illness and exclusion of ill students until they were noninfectious, rather than dismissal.

In Chicago, Illinois, USA, the first cases of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 infection were identified on April 28, 2009, of which 1 occurred in an elementary school student. In accordance with CDC guidance at the time, the school (school A) was closed for 1 week, April 29–May 5, 2009. CDC and the Chicago Department of Public Health investigated respiratory illnesses among students and their households during the period surrounding the school closure.

A telephone survey of students' households was conducted during May 15–20, 2009. One adult member of each household was asked whether any household members had been "sick with cold or flu symptoms or fever" since April 12. Age, date of illness onset, and symptoms and signs (fever, cough, sore throat, rhinorrhea or nasal congestion [runny or stuffy nose]) were recorded. Acute respiratory illness was defined as > 1 symptom or sign from the list provided. Influenza-like illness was defined as fever plus cough or sore throat. Reports were excluded if onset date was before April 12 or unknown. Descriptive analysis was performed, and household attack rates were calculated. Dates of onset were used to evaluate timing of illness in relation to school closure and possible transmission within households. The investigation was approved as nonresearch by CDC.

For more information about side effects, see the section " What are the possible side effects of TRUVADA? "

Other important information for people who take TRUVADA to help reduce their risk of getting human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infection, also called pre-exposure prophylaxis or "PrEP":

Before taking TRUVADA to reduce your risk of getting HIV-1 infection:

You must be HIV-1 negative to start TRUVADA. You must get tested to make sure that you do not already have HIV-1 infection.
Do not take TRUVADA for HIV-1 PrEP unless you are confirmed to be HIV-1 negative.
Some HIV-1 tests can miss HIV-1 infection in a person who has recently become infected. If you have flu-like symptoms, you could have recently become infected with HIV-1. Tell your healthcare provider if you had a flu-like illness within the last month before starting TRUVADA or at any time while taking TRUVADA. Symptoms of new HIV-1 infection include:
tiredness
fever
joint or muscle aches
headache
sore throat
vomiting or diarrhea
rash
night sweats
enlarged lymph nodes in the neck or groin

While you are taking TRUVADA for HIV-1 PrEP:

TRUVADA does not prevent other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Practice safer sex by using a latex or polyurethane condom to reduce the risk of getting STIs.
You must stay HIV-negative to keep taking TRUVADA for HIV-1 PrEP.
Know your HIV-1 status and the HIV-1 status of your partners.
Ask your partners with HIV-1 if they are taking anti-HIV-1 medicines and have an undetectable viral load. An undetectable viral load is when the amount of virus in the blood is too low to be measured in a lab test. To maintain an undetectable viral load, your partners must keep taking HIV-1 medicines every day. Your risk of getting HIV-1 is lower if your partners with HIV-1 are taking effective treatment.
Get tested for HIV-1 at least every 3 months or when your healthcare provider tells you.
Get tested for other STIs such as syphilis, chlamydia, and gonorrhea. These infections make it easier for HIV-1 to infect you.
If you think you were exposed to HIV-1, tell your healthcare provider right away. They may want to do more tests to be sure you are still HIV-1 negative.
Get information and support to help reduce sexual risk behaviors.
Do not miss any doses of TRUVADA. Missing doses increases your risk of getting HIV-1 infection.
If you do become HIV-1 positive, you need more medicine than TRUVADA alone to treat HIV-1. TRUVADA by itself is not a complete treatment for HIV-1.
If you have HIV-1 and take only TRUVADA, over time your HIV-1 may become harder to treat.

### Mitochondrial changes associated with viral infectious diseases in the paediatric population [^116M8561]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2021). Medium credibility.

2.3.1 Structure and replication cycle

HSV presents a typical morphology with an icosahedral capsule of 162 capsomeres, covered with a viral envelope, and includes a genome comprising a single DNA molecule, from 120 to 250 kbp. The viral infection exhibits a definitive tendency toward tropism, being highly recurrent on the surfaces of organs that become infected. The productive phase of infection, where the virus releases multiple viral proteins, is followed by a latency phase in which the viral genome remains within host cells throughout the life of the infected individual. Occasionally, latent HSV can undergo reactivation processes and once again lead to a productive phase in which numerous viral proteins are released.

The HSV viral cycle can be divided into different phases including(i) entry phase; (ii) expression of viral genes, the glycoproteins and other virion components involved in the development of the infection, including UL41, which induces inhibition of host protein synthesis, destroying most of the mRNAs, allowing HSV to fully take over the protein synthesis machinery and increase efficiency of virus production and UL13 protein kinase, whose absence blocks infection. Once in the cell, the capsid passes through the nuclear pores and releases the DNA into the nucleoplasm. It is probable that the cellular cytoskeleton contributes to transport to the nucleus. (iii) Replication, carried out in the cell nucleus; (iv) combination, encapsidation and release, meaning that the linear viral DNA is packaged in a preformed capsid containing the viral protease; and (v) latency periods alternating with reactivation periods, in which the virus can be transported through the axon to the periphery, producing lytic infection at the level of the epithelial cells.

2.3.2 HSV in the paediatric population

Neonatal HSV infection causes high mortality and significant morbidity. Incidence estimates range from 1/3000 to 1/20,000 births. Type 2 predominates over type 1 HSV. In the United States, paediatric HSV infections are common; as many as 36% of children < 14 years of age have serologic evidence of HSV‐1 infection. Often around the age of 5, a child's first cold sore may appear. Cold sores (also called fever blisters or oral herpes) start as small blisters that form around the lips and mouth. After a few days, the blisters crust over and heal completely in a week.

### Respiratory viral infections in children with asthma: do they matter and can we prevent them? [^112bZDA1]. BMC Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Preventing viral infections by non-immunologic methods

Children are important vectors for HRV transmission to family members particularly siblings. HRV shedding peaks two to four days after infection and decreases sharply thereafter, although nasal samples can be positive for rhinovirus for up to five weeks after a symptomatic infection.

There are three ways of common cold transmission in children. First, inhalation of small particles aerosolized by coughing; second, large particle droplets from saliva expelled while sneezing; and third, self-inoculation of one's own conjunctivae or nasal mucosa after touching a person or object contaminated with the cold viruses. The first two methods are inefficient, while the third is the most important method of transmission. The mode of transmission could differ with age of the index case, duration of contact, and other factors. Moreover, there is some evidence that the daily activities of infected people can lead to the contamination of environmental surfaces with HRV e.g. light switches, telephone dial buttons and handsets.

Meticulous hand hygiene is the best measure to prevent the common cold; frequent hand washing and avoid touching one's nose and eyes. The use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers is also effective. The promotion of handwashing was associated with a 12–34% reduction in respiratory-tract infections and colds in child-care centres in the USA Canada and Australia and a 21% decrease in absences due to respiratory illness in the school setting. Hand hygiene campaigns were also successful in reducing absenteeism caused by influenza-like illnesses among schoolchildren in Egypt. Similar programs within families would be expected to reduce transmission of HRV between family members.

A recent Cochrane review which included data from 67 randomised controlled trials and observational studies, investigated the effectiveness of physical interventions to reduce the spread of respiratory viruses. The authors concluded that respiratory virus spread can be reduced by hygiene measures (such as handwashing), especially around younger children and can reduce transmission from children to other family members. Controversy still exists and a newly published study showed that an antiviral hand treatment used by adult volunteers, recruited from a university community, did not significantly reduce RV infection or RV-related common cold illnesses.

Asthmatic children should avoid close contact with people who have colds especially during the first three days of their illness. There is little evidence to support the effectiveness of face masks to reduce the risk of viral respiratory infections and consequently, the use of mask is generally not recommended for prevention of common cold.

### A review of monkeypox infection during pregnancy [^114vehxJ]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2023). Medium credibility.

The present study aimed to review monkeypox infection during pregnancy: its epidemiology and etiology, transmission, clinical manifestations and complications, diagnosis, management, antenatal testing and delivery, prevention, awareness, and recommendations. Monkeypox can spread via vertical transmission. The usual clinical symptoms include fever, rash (vesicles, crust), new genital lesions, or sore throat. It is only recommended to use cidofovir in pregnant patients when they are severely infected with monkeypox. All woman who are at high risk of exposure for monkeypox need to be vaccinated with the smallpox vaccine regardless of their pregnancy status. Monitoring includes regular non-stress test monitoring in addition to ultrasound performed at various stages of pregnancy. High index of suspicion, informed physicians, reporting of cases, and support of research are all needed for the management of monkeypox infection during pregnancy.

### Bacillus calmette-Guérin vaccination for protection against recurrent herpes labialis: a nested randomised controlled trial [^112h74d7]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Summary

Background

Recurrences of herpes simplex virus (HSV) in the orofacial region (herpes labialis or cold sores) impact quality-of-life. We aimed to study whether the bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine can attenuate cold sore recurrences through off-target immunomodulatory effects.

Methods

In this nested randomised controlled trial within the multicentre, phase 3 BRACE trial, 6828 healthcare workers were randomised in 36 sites in Australia, the Netherlands, Spain, the United Kingdom and Brazil, to receive BCG-Denmark or no BCG (1:1 ratio using a web-based procedure) and followed for 12 months with 3-monthly questionnaires. Exclusion criteria included contraindication to BCG vaccine or previous vaccination with BCG within the past year, any other live-attenuated vaccine within the last month, or any COVID-specific vaccine. The intervention group received one intradermal dose of 0.1 mL of BCG-Denmark corresponding to 2−8 x 10 5 colony forming units of Mycobacterium bovis, Danish strain 1331. The primary outcome was the difference in restricted mean survival time (i.e. time to first cold-sore recurrence), in participants with frequent recurrent herpes labialis (≥ 4 recurrences/year), analysed by intention-to-treat. Secondary outcomes addressed additional questions, including analyses in other sub-populations. Adverse events were monitored closely during the first 3 months and were reported in all participants who received one dose of study drug according to intervention received. The BRACE trial is registered with.

Findings

Between March 30, 2020 and February 18, 2021, 84 individuals with frequent recurrent cold sores were randomly assigned to BCG (n = 38) or control (n = 46). The average time to first cold-sore recurrence was 1.55 months longer in the BCG group (95% CI 0.27–2.82, p = 0.02) than the control group (hazard ratio 0.54, 95% CI 0.32–0.91; intention-to-treat). The beneficial effect of BCG was greater in the as-treated population (difference 1.91 months, 95% CI 0.69–3.12, p = 0.003; hazard ratio 0.45, 95% CI 0.26–0.76). In prespecified subgroup analyses, only sex modified the treatment effect (interaction p = 0.007), with benefit restricted to males. Over 12 months, a greater proportion of participants in the BCG group compared with the control group reported a decrease in duration (61% vs 21%), severity (74% vs 21%), frequency (55% vs 21%), and impact on quality of life (42% vs 15%) of cold sore recurrences. In participants who had ever had a cold sore, there was also a decrease in self-reported burden of recurrences in the BCG group. In participants who had never had a cold sore, there was an increased risk of a first episode in the BCG group (risk difference 1.4%; 95% CI 0.3–2.6%, p = 0.02). There were no safety concerns.

Interpretation

BCG-Denmark vaccination had a beneficial effect on herpes labialis, particularly in males with frequent recurrences, but may increase the risk of a first cold sore.

### Bacillus calmette-Guérin vaccination for protection against recurrent herpes labialis: a nested randomised controlled trial [^114zTHzb]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Recurrent herpes labialis ('cold sore') is a common condition caused by reactivation of the herpes simplex virus (HSV) in the orofacial region.HSV-1 is endemic worldwide, infecting up to 95% of individuals, of whom between 14 and 40% have frequent recurrent cold sores. Recurrences can be debilitating and significantly reduce quality of life. Long-term suppressive therapy with an oral antiviral is somewhat effective in reducing the burden of HSV recurrences, but is costly, and involves the risk of adverse events. There is still no vaccine available against HSV.

In addition to its intended effects, the anti-tuberculosis vaccine, bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG), induces off-target ('non-specific') effects that confer additional benefits. Examples of these immunomodulatory effects include reduction in all-cause mortality in infants, prevention and treatment of certain cancers, protection against progression of autoimmune diseases, and protection against a variety of viral infections. Observational studies suggest this includes the prevention of HSV recurrences. In a systematic review of observational studies, BCG vaccination was found to be beneficial in 78% of individuals with recurrent herpes labialis or genitalis, with 37% being recurrence-free for an extended period, 41% experiencing less frequent or severe episodes, and only 22% reporting no change. Albeit promising, these results have never been confirmed in a randomised controlled trial (RCT). The only RCT published to date, restricted to patients with herpes genitalis, had a number of limitations, in particular the use of a potentially beneficial intervention in the control group.

This study aimed to determine in a subgroup of adults with recurrent cold sores whether BCG vaccination compared with placebo reduces HSV recurrences in the BRACE RCT (BCG vaccination to reduce the impact of COVID-19 in healthcare workers). Secondary aims addressed a wider range of objectives, including the impact of BCG on the burden of recurrences and the risk of a first cold sore episode in sub-groups defined by differing frequencies of HSV recurrence.

### SARS-CoV-2 cold-chain transmission: characteristics, risks, and strategies [^116FgTQ5]. Journal of Medical Virology (2022). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2), the etiologic agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19), is mainly transmitted by respiratory droplets and direct contact with respiratory droplets between humans, and may be transmitted by aerosols when exposed to high concentration of SARS‐CoV‐2 contaminated aerosols for a long time in a relatively closed environment. Meanwhile, some studies have found that SARS‐CoV‐2 also transmitted by fomite contact, a more complex and hidden transmission route, may introduce SARS‐CoV‐2 into the low prevalence countries and regions.

The survival time of SARS‐CoV‐2 is related to humidity, temperature and other conditions. Low temperature and certain humidity are conducive to the survival and infectivity of the virus, indicating that cold‐chain fomites may be more suitable for SARS‐CoV‐2 long‐time survival and long‐distance spread during international trades. Since June 2020, SARS‐CoV‐2 RNA had been detected in imported cold‐chain products in most provinces of China. According to the report of the press conference of Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism of The State Council, a total of 3.23 million samples of cold chain products had been randomly checked by the customs as of October 29, 2021, of which 499 samples were SARS‐CoV‐2 RNA positive. In addition, since the localized outbreak of SARS‐CoV‐2 was brought under control in April 2020, clusters of COVID‐19 outbreaks caused by SARS‐CoV‐2 contaminated imported cold‐chain products exposure have occurred in some parts of mainland China, which brought challenges to COVID‐19 prevention and control. Therefore, it is necessary to systematically analyze the underlying risks of SARS‐CoV‐2 transmission by cold‐chain products in the ongoing COVID‐19 pandemic.

Here, we summarize the characteristics and mode of SARS‐CoV‐2 cold‐chain transmission from six COVID‐19 outbreaks caused by SARS‐CoV‐2 contaminated imported cold‐chain products exposure in China and the similar reports of SARS‐CoV‐2 transmission by cold‐chain worldwide. In addition, we analyze the underlying risks of SARS‐CoV‐2 cold‐chain transmission and propose the preventive strategies.

### Interventions for prevention of herpes simplex labialis (cold sores on the lips) [^114ZNDVm]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Herpes simplex labialis (HSL), also known as cold sores, is a common disease of the lips caused by the herpes simplex virus, which is found throughout the world. It presents as a painful vesicular eruption, forming unsightly crusts, which cause cosmetic disfigurement and psychosocial distress. There is no cure available, and it recurs periodically.

Objectives

To assess the effects of interventions for the prevention of HSL in people of all ages.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to 19 May 2015: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, the Oral Health Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL in the Cochrane Library (Issue 4, 2015), MEDLINE (from 1946), EMBASE (from 1974), LILACS (from 1982), the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) database, Airiti Library, and 5 trial registers. To identify further references to relevant randomised controlled trials, we scanned the bibliographies of included studies and published reviews, and we also contacted the original researchers of our included studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of interventions for preventing HSL in immunocompetent people.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently selected trials, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias. A third author was available for resolving differences of opinion.

This review included 32 RCTs, with a total of 2640 immunocompetent participants, covering 19 treatments. The quality of the body of evidence was low to moderate for most outcomes, but was very low for a few outcomes. Our primary outcomes were 'Incidence of HSL' and 'Adverse effects during use of the preventative intervention'. The evidence for short-term (≤ 1 month) use of oral aciclovir in preventing recurrent HSL was inconsistent across the doses used in the studies: 2 RCTs showed low quality evidence for a reduced recurrence of HSL with aciclovir 400 mg twice daily (risk ratio (RR) 0.26, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.13 to 0.51; n = 177), while 1 RCT testing aciclovir 800 mg twice daily and 2 RCTs testing 200 mg 5 times daily found no similar preventive effects (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.87; n = 237; moderate quality evidence and RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.20 to 1.07; n = 66; low quality evidence, respectively). The direction of intervention effect was unrelated to the risk of bias. The evidence from 1 RCT for the effect of short-term use of valaciclovir in reducing recurrence of HSL by clinical evaluation was uncertain (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.23 to 1.28; n = 125; moderate quality evidence), as was the evidence from 1 RCT testing short-term use of famciclovir. Long-term (> 1 month) use of oral antiviral agents reduced the recurrence of HSL. There was low quality evidence from 1 RCT that long-term use of oral aciclovir reduced clinical recurrences (1.80 versus 0.85 episodes per participant per a 4-month period, P = 0.009) and virological recurrence (1.40 versus 0.40 episodes per participant per a 4-month period, P = 0.003). One RCT found long-term use of valaciclovir effective in reducing the incidence of HSL (with a decrease of 0.09 episodes per participant per month; n = 95). One RCT found that a long-term suppressive regimen of valaciclovir had a lower incidence of HSL than an episodic regimen of valciclovir (difference in means (MD) -0.10 episodes per participant per month, 95% CI -0.16 to -0.05; n = 120). These trials found no increase in adverse events associated with the use of oral antiviral agents (moderate quality evidence). There was no evidence to show that short-term use of topical antiviral agents prevented recurrent HSL. There was moderate quality evidence from 2 RCTs that topical aciclovir 5% cream probably has little effect on preventing recurrence of HSL (pooled RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.72; n = 271). There was moderate quality evidence from a single RCT that topical foscarnet 3% cream has little effect in preventing HSL (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.40; n = 295). The efficacy of long-term use of topical aciclovir cream was uncertain. One RCT found significantly fewer research-diagnosed recurrences of HSL when on aciclovir cream treatment than on placebo (P < 0.05), but found no significant differences in the mean number of participant-reported recurrences between the 2 groups (P ≥ 0.05). One RCT found no preventive effect of topical application of 1,5-pentanediol gel for 26 weeks (P > 0.05). Another RCT found that the group who used 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclo dextrin 20% gel for 6 months had significantly more recurrences than the placebo group (P = 0.003). These studies found no increase in adverse events related to the use of topical antiviral agents. Two RCTs found that the application of sunscreen significantly prevented recurrent HSL induced by experimental ultraviolet light (pooled RR 0.07, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.33; n = 111), but another RCT found that sunscreen did not prevent HSL induced by sunlight (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.25 to 5.06; n = 51). These RCTs did not report adverse events. There were very few data suggesting that thymopentin, low-level laser therapy, and hypnotherapy are effective in preventing recurrent HSL, with one to two RCTs for each intervention. We failed to find any evidence of efficacy for lysine, LongoVital® supplementation, gamma globulin, herpes simplex virus (HSV) type I subunit vaccine, and yellow fever vaccine in preventing HSL. There were no consistent data supporting the efficacy of levamisole and interferon, which were also associated with an increased risk of adverse effects such as fever.

Authors' Conclusions

The current evidence demonstrates that long-term use of oral antiviral agents can prevent HSL, but the clinical benefit is small. We did not find evidence of an increased risk of adverse events. On the other hand, the evidence on topical antiviral agents and other interventions either showed no efficacy or could not confirm their efficacy in preventing HSL.

### Current management and recommendations for access to antiviral therapy of herpes labialis [^113cyp97]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2012). Low credibility.

Herpes labialis is a common skin infective condition, worldwide, which is primarily caused by HSV-1. Recurrent episodes of herpes labialis, also known as cold sores, can be frequent, painful, long-lasting and disfiguring for infected patients. At present, there are two types of antivirals for the treatment of herpes labialis, topical and oral, which are available over the counter or as prescription-only. The aim of antiviral therapy is to block viral replication to enable shortening the duration of symptoms and to accelerate healing of the lesions associated with herpes labialis. This review examines the evidence for the effectiveness of current topical and oral antivirals in the management of recurrent episodes of herpes labialis. In most countries, oral antivirals for herpes labialis are available as prescription-only. However, in early 2010, the oral antiviral famciclovir was reclassified from prescription-only medicine to pharmacist-controlled status in New Zealand. The benefits and risks associated with moving an antiviral therapy for herpes labialis from prescription-only to pharmacist-controlled status are reviewed here, and the implications for patients, general physicians and pharmacists are considered.

### Bacillus calmette-Guérin vaccination for protection against recurrent herpes labialis: a nested randomised controlled trial [^111ff44j]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

BCG vaccine has well-documented effects on both the innate and the adaptive immune system. However, the specific immunological mechanisms that underlie the off-target effect of BCG vaccination are not yet fully understood. In those with recurrent cold sores, a BCG-induced change in the balance of lymphocytes subsets and/or enhancement of interferon-γ production might play a role in the observed clinical effect.,

In our study, despite a beneficial effect on HSV recurrences, BCG vaccination did not reduce the risk of a first cold sore episode. The opposite was in fact observed, with a slightly increased risk in the BCG group. This might be explained by different immunological mechanisms underlying susceptibility to initial infection compared with the mechanisms controlling latent infection and suppressing reactivation. This provides an interesting insight on the immunomodulation induced by BCG vaccination. It is noteworthy that this finding is consistent with the results or the BRACE trial which found that the risk of COVID-19 was higher in the BCG group when compared with the placebo group. We plan further exploration of these mechanisms using blood samples collected from participants at baseline and during follow-up.

The small number of participants with frequent recurrent cold sores included in this analysis and the inability to ensure complete blinding in trials of BCG are potential limitations of this study. In addition, the episodes were self-reported, without virological confirmation. However, this is the first RCT to report the effect of BCG vaccination on cold sore recurrence.

In summary, BCG-Denmark vaccination had a beneficial effect on herpes labialis, with an observed increase in the time spent without a recurrence amongst individuals previously reporting frequent recurrences. The self-reported burden of cold sore recurrences generally decreased following vaccination, especially in those with the most frequent recurrences. Interestingly, in contrast, we observed a small increased risk of reporting a first cold sore episode in the BCG group. Future studies should focus on other populations in which herpes recurrence has a significant impact, including children (in whom cold sore recurrences impact feeding and schooling) and amongst individuals with recurrent herpes genitalis.

### Heated, humidified air for the common cold [^116MxEWf]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Heated, humidified air has long been used by people with the common cold. The theoretical basis is that steam may help congested mucus drain better and that heat may destroy the cold virus as it does in vitro. This is an update of a review last published in 2013.

Objectives

To assess the effects of inhaling heated water vapour (steam) in the treatment of the common cold by comparing symptoms, viral shedding, and nasal resistance.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (to February 2017), MEDLINE (1966 to 24 February 2017), Embase (1990 to 24 February 2017), and Current Contents (1998 to 24 February 2017). We also searched World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) (8 March 2017) and ClinicalTrials.gov (8 March 2017) as well as reference lists of included studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials using heated water vapour in participants with the common cold or experimentally induced common cold were eligible for inclusion.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Three review authors independently screened titles and abstracts for inclusion of potential studies identified from the search. We recorded the selection process in sufficient detail to complete a PRISMA flow diagram. We used a data collection form for study characteristics and outcome data that was developed and used for previous versions of this review. Two review authors independently extracted data, and a third review author resolved any disagreements. We used Review Manager 5 software to analyse data.

Main Results

We included six trials from five publications involving a total of 387 participants. We included no new studies in this 2017 update. The 'Risk of bias' assessment suggested an unclear risk of bias in the domain of randomisation and a low risk of bias in performance, detection, attrition, and reporting. It was uncertain whether heated, humidified air provides symptomatic relief for the common cold, as the fixed-effect analysis showed evidence of an effect (odds ratio (OR) 0.30, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.16 to 0.56; 2 studies, 149 participants), but the random-effects analysis showed no significant difference in the results (OR 0.22, 95% CI 0.03 to 1.95). There is an argument for using either form of analysis. No studies demonstrated an exacerbation of clinical symptom scores. One study conducted in the USA demonstrated worsened nasal resistance, but an earlier Israeli study showed improvement. One study examined viral shedding in nasal washings, finding no significant difference between treatment and placebo groups (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.04 to 5.19). As judged by the subjective response to therapy (i.e. therapy did not help), the number of participants reporting resolution of symptoms was not significantly higher in the heated humidified group (OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.28 to 1.18; 2 studies, 124 participants). There was significant heterogeneity in the effects of heated, humidified air on different outcomes, therefore we graded the quality of the evidence as low. Some studies reported minor adverse events (including discomfort or irritation of the nose).

Authors' Conclusions

The current evidence does not show any benefits or harms from the use of heated, humidified air delivered via the RhinoTherm device for the treatment of the common cold. There is a need for more double-blind, randomised trials that include standardised treatment modalities.

### Identification of a herpes simplex labialis susceptibility region on human chromosome 21 [^116sJ1hx]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Most of the United States population is infected with either herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), herpes simplex virus type 2, or both. Reactivations of HSV-1 infection cause herpes simplex labialis (HSL; cold sores or fever blisters), which is the most common recurring viral infection in humans.

Methods

To investigate the possibility of a human genetic component conferring resistance or susceptibility to cold sores (i.e., a HSL susceptibility gene), we conducted a genetic linkage analysis that included serotyping and phenotyping 421 individuals from 39 families enrolled in the Utah Genetic Reference Project.

Results

Linkage analysis identified a 2.5-Mb nonrecombinant region of interest on the long arm of human chromosome 21, with a multipoint logarithm of odds score of 3.9 noted near marker abmc65 (D21S409). Nonparametric linkage analysis of the data also provided strong evidence for linkage (P = 0.0005). This region of human chromosome 21 contains 6 candidate genes for herpes susceptibility.

Conclusions

The development of frequent cold sores is associated with a region on the long arm of human chromosome 21. This region contains several candidate genes that could influence the frequency of outbreaks of HSL.

### Vaccines for the common cold [^1133qJDj]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The common cold is a spontaneously remitting infection of the upper respiratory tract, characterised by a runny nose, nasal congestion, sneezing, cough, malaise, sore throat, and fever (usually < 37.8º C). The widespread morbidity caused by the common cold worldwide is related to its ubiquitousness rather than its severity. The development of vaccines for the common cold has been difficult because of antigenic variability of the common cold virus and the indistinguishable multiple other viruses and even bacteria acting as infective agents. There is uncertainty regarding the efficacy and safety of interventions for preventing the common cold in healthy people. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2011 and previously updated in 2013.

Objectives

To assess the clinical effectiveness and safety of vaccines for preventing the common cold in healthy people.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (September 2016), MEDLINE (1948 to September 2016), Embase (1974 to September 2016), CINAHL (1981 to September 2016), and LILACS (1982 to September 2016). We also searched three trials registers for ongoing studies and four websites for additional trials (February 2017). We included no language or date restrictions.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of any virus vaccines compared with placebo to prevent the common cold in healthy people.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently evaluated methodological quality and extracted trial data. We resolved disagreements by discussion or by consulting a third review author.

Main Results

We found no additional RCTs for inclusion in this update. This review includes one RCT dating from the 1960s with an overall high risk of bias. The RCT included 2307 healthy participants, all of whom were included in analyses. This trial compared the effect of an adenovirus vaccine against placebo. No statistically significant difference in common cold incidence was found: there were 13 (1.14%) events in 1139 participants in the vaccines group and 14 (1.19%) events in 1168 participants in the placebo group (risk ratio 0.95, 95% confidence interval 0.45 to 2.02; P = 0.90). No adverse events related to the live vaccine were reported. The quality of the evidence was low due to limitations in methodological quality and a wide 95% confidence interval.

Authors' Conclusions

This Cochrane Review was based on one study with low-quality evidence. We found no conclusive results to support the use of vaccines for preventing the common cold in healthy people compared with placebo. We identified a need for well-designed, adequately powered RCTs to investigate vaccines for the common cold in healthy people. Any future trials on medical treatments for preventing the common cold should assess a variety of virus vaccines for this condition. Outcome measures should include common cold incidence, vaccine safety, and mortality related to the vaccine.

### Mitochondrial changes associated with viral infectious diseases in the paediatric population [^116Ybdpd]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2021). Medium credibility.

Despite the considerable data depicting NRTI‐derived mitochondrial dysfunction, information regarding the potential mitochondrial toxicity of ganciclovir is scarce. Only one study reports secondary lactic acidosis related to ganciclovir in an adult patient that received this drug after kidney transplant. However, there are some studies showing that ganciclovir produces alterations in the mtDNA of senescent cells. The most common side effect of treatment with valganciclovir, already reported with ganciclovir, is neutropenia;, which occurs in up to two‐thirds of children treated for 6 weeks. Other less commonly reported side effects are, anaemia, nephrotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, fever and skin rashes.

The impact of the congenital infection has led to the need to develop consensus regarding the prevention of infection in pregnant women, the diagnosis during pregnancy and its treatment.

Notably, the first months of life are a key stage in the child's development, in which the health problems will likely affect their future life.

2.3 Herpes simplex virus

Human herpes simplex virus (HSV) types 1 and 2 belong to the family Herpesviridae. HSV is a ubiquitous viral pathogen capable of causing both productive and latent infections in its human host. Infections are generally mild but can spread to the CNS, causing serious neurological damage. To enter its host, the virus must overcome a barrier of mucosal surfaces, skin or cornea. Keratinocytes are the main target during the initial entry to establish a primary infection in the epithelium, followed by a latent neuronal infection. They are especially contagious when symptomatic, but can also be transmitted in the absence of symptoms. Symptoms are usually painful vesicles or ulcers at the infected site, causing cold sores, genital herpes, keratitis, or encephalitis.

What should I avoid while getting IMLYGIC?

IMLYGIC virus can spread to other areas of your body or to your close contacts (household members, caregivers, sex partners, or persons sharing the same bed).

Do the following to avoid spreading IMLYGIC to other areas of your body or to your close contacts:

Avoid direct contact between your treatment sites, dressings, or body fluids and close contacts (for example, use condoms when engaging in sexual activity, avoid kissing close contacts if either has an open mouth sore).
Wear gloves while putting on or changing your dressings.
Keep treatment sites covered with airtight and watertight dressings for at least 1 week after each treatment (or longer if the treatment site is weeping or oozing).
If the dressing comes loose or falls off, replace it right away with a clean dressing.
Place all used dressings and cleaning materials in a sealed plastic bag and throw them away in the garbage.
Do not touch or scratch the treatment sites.

What are possible side effects of IMLYGIC?

The most common side effects of IMLYGIC include:

Tiredness
Chills
Fever
Nausea
Flu-like symptoms
Pain at treatment site

Tell your doctor right away if you get any of the signs and symptoms of herpes infection, including but not limited to:

Supplementary analyses in participants who never previously had a cold sore

In the 4553 participants who reported no prior cold sore occurrences in the baseline questionnaire, the proportion of participants reporting a first cold sore episode during the 12 months of follow-up was greater in the BCG group (90/2007, 4.5%) compared with the control group (59/1861, 3.2%), with a RD of 1.4% (95% CI 0.3–2.6%, p 0.02; Table 2, Fig. 3). The time to first cold sore occurrence was also shorter (difference −0.07 months, 95% CI −0.14 to 0.00, p 0.06; Table 2) and the number of cold sore episodes over 12 months greater (IRR 1.5, 95% CI 1.0–2.3, p 0.04; Table 2) in the BCG group compared to the control group.

As previously reported, there were no safety concerns following BCG vaccination in the BRACE trial (see Appendix).

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Patient Information).

Importance of Adequate Hydration: Patients should be advised to maintain adequate hydration.

Missed Dose: Instruct patients that if they miss a dose of valacyclovir tablets, to take it as soon as they remember. Advise patients not to double their next dose or take more than the prescribed dose.

Cold Sores (Herpes Labialis): Patients should be advised to initiate treatment at the earliest symptom of a cold sore (e.g., tingling, itching, or burning). There are no data on the effectiveness of treatment initiated after the development of clinical signs of a cold sore (e.g., papule, vesicle, or ulcer). Patients should be instructed that treatment for cold sores should not exceed 1 day (2 doses) and that their doses should be taken about 12 hours apart. Patients should be informed that valacyclovir tablets are not a cure for cold sores.

Genital Herpes: Patients should be informed that valacyclovir tablets are not a cure for genital herpes. Because genital herpes is a sexually transmitted disease, patients should avoid contact with lesions or intercourse when lesions and/or symptoms are present to avoid infecting partners. Genital herpes is frequently transmitted in the absence of symptoms through asymptomatic viral shedding. Therefore, patients should be counseled to use safer sex practices in combination with suppressive therapy with valacyclovir tablets. Sex partners of infected persons should be advised that they might be infected even if they have no symptoms. Type-specific serologic testing of asymptomatic partners of persons with genital herpes can determine whether risk for HSV-2 acquisition exists.

### A randomised double-blind study comparing the effect of 1072-nm light against placebo for the treatment of herpes labialis [^116U123C]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Previous research demonstrated that 1072-nm narrowband laser light is effective in the treatment of cold sores.

Aim

To evaluate the efficacy of an over-the-counter cold-sore treatment device (Virulite CS) incorporating 1072-nm light-emitting diodes.

Methods

A randomised, prospective, double-blind, self-reported study was performed to compare the efficacy of at least six 3-min treatments of 1072-nm narrowband light against placebo, in the treatment of herpes labialis.

Results

The 1072-nm light-emitting diode device reduced cold-sore healing time to 6.3 days compared with 9.4 days for placebo (P = 0.048). The time the cold sore took to form a crust was also reduced from 2.00 days for those treated with 1072-nm light, compared with 2.88 days for placebo (P = 0.059)

Conclusions

The significant difference between the mean healing times in the two groups demonstrates that the Virulite CS device is an effective means of treating herpes labialis.

Primary outcome

Of the 84 individuals with frequent recurrent cold sores, 70 reported a recurrence (32/38 (84%) in the BCG group and 38/46 (83%) in the control group) with a median time to recurrence of 2.2 (IQR 1.6, 3.5) months after randomisation in the BCG group, compared with 1.8 (IQR 1.1, 4.2) months in the control group. The time to first cold sore recurrence was 1.55 months greater in the BCG group (95% CI 0.27–2.82, p 0.02) with a HR of 0.54 (95% CI 0.32–0.91; Fig. 2, Table 2). The beneficial effect of BCG on the time to first cold sore recurrence was greater in the as-treated population (difference 1.91 months, 95% CI 0.69–3.12, p 0.003; HR 0.45, 95% CI 0.26–0.76; Table 2), and persisted in all the other sensitivity and supplementary analyses (Supplementary Tables S1–S3). In prespecified subgroup analyses (Fig. 2), only sex was associated with the treatment effect (p for treatment arm × sex interaction 0.007), with a difference in time to first cold sore recurrence of 5.20 (95% CI −0.14 to 10.53) months in males (HR 0.19, 95% CI 0.02–1.71), compared with 0.43 (95% CI −1.04 to 1.91) months in females (HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.53–1.41).

### Prevention of exacerbations: how are we doing and can we do better? [^116hpUvc]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2006). Low credibility.

Prevention of exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) can involve removing the cause or reducing the patient's vulnerability to the cause. This article addresses the following issues: What is the problem during an exacerbation, what are the causes of an exacerbation, what can prevent exacerbations, and who are we? The difference between a patient with COPD during an exacerbation and after recovery is small. It is unlikely that patients with early COPD experience less exposure to exacerbation causes than those with severe disease; it is just that the consequences are more severe for those with severe disease. Interventions that produce small absolute benefits can therefore have a disproportionately large effect on exacerbation reduction. Recognized causes include season, cold weather, pollution events, bacterial infection, viral infection, and treatment withdrawal. Countries with warmer climates have much larger mortality in cold weather than those with colder climates. Reducing exacerbations in more temperate climates may be altered as much by changes in clothing and bedroom heating as by changes in treatment. Taking more exercise in cold weather may be the underlying reason for the reduction of exacerbations after pulmonary rehabilitation. Influenza vaccination reduces influenza severity and reduces transmission from health care workers to patients. There are a number of pharmacologic interventions shown to reduce (the effect of) exacerbations, including inhaled corticosteroids, long-acting beta-agonists, long-acting anticholinergics, mucolytics, and perhaps antibiotics that reduce Haemophilus carriage. The effect of the bronchodilators is additive to inhaled corticosteroids; how far the other interventions are complementary is unclear. So far, we have had a very medical response to COPD exacerbations. Altering social and behavioral aspects is likely to be complementary.

### Potential effect of HIV type 1 antiretroviral and herpes simplex virus type 2 antiviral therapy on transmission and acquisition of HIV type 1 infection [^113mMUkQ]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Biological strategies for interrupting transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 should be directed at reducing infectiousness of and susceptibility to HIV-1. Potential antiretroviral interventions include reducing the likelihood of transmission of HIV-1 by reducing HIV-1 load in the blood and genital tract of HIV-1 — infected person, prophylaxis after high-risk exposure, and pre-exposure prophylaxis for very high risk populations. Antiviral treatment of herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 2, the most common cause of genital ulcers, should be evaluated as a strategy for HIV-1 infection prevention by reducing infectiousness of and susceptibility to HIV-1, on the basis of biological and epidemiological data indicating that HSV-2 facilitates transmission and acquisition of HIV-1. The rationale for antiretroviral and HSV-2-specific interventions and studies to test these strategies are described.

### SARS-CoV-2 cold-chain transmission: characteristics, risks, and strategies [^117XL58o]. Journal of Medical Virology (2022). Medium credibility.

Low temperature and certain humidity are conducive to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) for long-time survival and long-distance spread during logistics and trades. Contaminated cold-chain or frozen products and outer packaging act as the carrier of SARS-CoV-2, that infects the high-risk population who works in the ports, cold storage or seafood market. Since the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic worldwide, multiple localized outbreaks caused by SARS-CoV-2 contaminated imported cold-chain products have been reported in China, which brought challenges to COVID-19 prevention and control. Here, we review the evidences of SARS-CoV-2 cold-chain transmission from six confirmed cold-chain related COVID-19 outbreaks in China, especially in terms of SARS-CoV-2 whole-genome sequencing and virus isolation. In addition, we summarize the characteristics and mode of SARS-CoV-2 cold-chain transmission from both six COVID-19 outbreaks in China and the outbreaks suspected cold-chain transmission in other countries. Finally, we analyze the underlying risks of SARS-CoV-2 cold-chain transmission and propose the preventive countermeasures.

### Valacyclovir hydrochloride (valacyclovir) [^11435F2m]. FDA (2019). Medium credibility.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

See FDA-Approved Patient Labeling.

17.1 Importance of Adequate Hydration

Patients should be advised to maintain adequate hydration.

17.2 Cold Sores (Herpes Labialis)

Patients should be advised to initiate treatment at the earliest symptom of a cold sore (e.g., tingling, itching, or burning). There are no data on the effectiveness of treatment initiated after the development of clinical signs of a cold sore (e.g., papule, vesicle, or ulcer). Patients should be instructed that treatment for cold sores should not exceed 1 day (2 doses) and that their doses should be taken about 12 hours apart. Patients should be informed that valacyclovir hydrochloride is not a cure for cold sores.

17.3 Genital Herpes

Patients should be informed that valacyclovir hydrochloride is not a cure for genital herpes. Because genital herpes is a sexually transmitted disease, patients should avoid contact with lesions or intercourse when lesions and/or symptoms are present to avoid infecting partners. Genital herpes is frequently transmitted in the absence of symptoms through asymptomatic viral shedding. Therefore, patients should be counseled to use safer sex practices in combination with suppressive therapy with valacyclovir hydrochloride. Sex partners of infected persons should be advised that they might be infected even if they have no symptoms. Type-specific serologic testing of asymptomatic partners of persons with genital herpes can determine whether risk for HSV-2 acquisition exists.

Valacyclovir hydrochloride has not been shown to reduce transmission of sexually transmitted infections other than HSV-2.

If medical management of a genital herpes recurrence is indicated, patients should be advised to initiate therapy at the first sign or symptom of an episode.

There are no data on the effectiveness of treatment initiated more than 72 hours after the onset of signs and symptoms of a first episode of genital herpes or more than 24 hours after the onset of signs and symptoms of a recurrent episode.

There are no data on the safety or effectiveness of chronic suppressive therapy of more than 1 year's duration in otherwise healthy patients. There are no data on the safety or effectiveness of chronic suppressive therapy of more than 6 months' duration in HIV-infected patients.

17.4 Herpes Zoster

There are no data on treatment initiated more than 72 hours after onset of the zoster rash. Patients should be advised to initiate treatment as soon as possible after a diagnosis of herpes zoster.

### Estimated global and regional incidence and prevalence of herpes simplex virus infections and genital ulcer disease in 2020: mathematical modelling analyses [^1164jm9m]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 1 and type 2 cause lifelong infections and are widespread worldwide, resulting in significant disease and economic burden. Both infections are characterised by frequent infectious subclinical shedding, along with symptomatic reactivations in a proportion of those infected.HSV-2 infection is almost always acquired through sexual transmission and is the leading cause of recurrent clinical genital ulcer disease (GUD) in most countries. In addition to the painful genital sores, genital herpes is associated with a range of social and psychological adverse outcomes, including effects on sexual relations, quality of life, and mental health issues such as depression, anxiety, and low self-esteem.HSV-2 infection is believed to increase the risk of HIV acquisition and transmission by threefold, potentially resulting in an epidemiological synergy between these two infections.

HSV-1 infection is typically acquired orally in childhood and commonly manifests as cold sores, but it can also cause more serious neurological, corneal, and mucocutaneous complications. Adults can acquire genital HSV-1 infection if they were not infected orally during childhood. Particularly in high-income countries, HSV-1 infection has been increasingly acquired sexually, and in several countries it is now the leading cause of first-episode genital herpes. Recurrences of genital HSV-1 are much less frequent compared with HSV-2 recurrences.

HSV-1 and HSV-2 infections can both be transmitted, although rarely, from genitally-infected mothers to their neonates during birth and through oral contact from caregivers postnatally, leading to neonatal herpes, a disabling disease in newborns with a high fatality rate. In response to the clinical disease burden of these two infections and their impact on sexual and reproductive health and HIV transmission, the WHO has advocated for efforts to reduce HSV disease burden by advancing the development of new prevention and treatment measures, such as vaccines.

In this article, we present global and regional modelling estimates of the incidence and prevalence of genital HSV infections as well as HSV-related GUD for the year 2020. In addition to updating earlier estimates, the present estimates benefit from methodological enhancements. The main enhancement is that HSV-1 and HSV-2 prevalence data, which provided the modelling input, are based on a series of standardised and comprehensive HSV systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and meta-regressions covering all global regions, published over the last few years.

### Vaccines for the common cold [^116HPjkV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The common cold is a spontaneously remitting infection of the upper respiratory tract, characterised by a runny nose, nasal congestion, sneezing, cough, malaise, sore throat and fever (usually < 37.8˚C). The widespread morbidity it causes worldwide is related to its ubiquitousness rather than its severity. The development of vaccines for the common cold has been difficult because of antigenic variability of the common cold virus and the indistinguishable multiple other viruses and even bacteria acting as infective agents. There is uncertainty regarding the efficacy and safety of interventions for preventing the common cold in healthy people.

Objectives

To assess the clinical effectiveness and safety of vaccines for preventing the common cold in healthy people.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (2012, Issue 12), MEDLINE (1948 to January week 1, 2013), EMBASE (1974 to January 2013), CINAHL (1981 to January 2013) and LILACS (1982 to January 2013).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of any virus vaccines to prevent the common cold in healthy people.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently evaluated methodological quality and extracted trial data. Disagreements were resolved by discussion or by consulting a third review author.

Main Results

This review included one RCT with 2307 healthy participants; all of them were analysed. This trial compared the effect of an adenovirus vaccine against a placebo. No statistically significant difference in common cold incidence was found: there were 13 events in 1139 participants in the vaccines group and 14 events in 1168 participants in the placebo group; risk ratio (RR) 0.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.45 to 2.02, P = 0.90). No adverse events related to the live vaccine were reported.

Authors' Conclusions

This Cochrane review has found a lack of evidence on the effects of vaccines for the common cold in healthy people. Only one RCT was found and this did not show differences between comparison groups; it also had a high risk of bias. There are no conclusive data to support the use of vaccines for preventing the common cold in healthy people. We identified the need for well-designed, adequately powered RCTs to investigate vaccines for the common cold in healthy people. Unless RCTs provide evidence of a treatment effect and the trade-off between potential benefits and harms is established, policy-makers, clinicians and academics should not recommend the use of vaccines for preventing the common cold in healthy people. Any future trials on medical treatments for preventing the common cold should assess a variety of virus vaccines for this condition. Outcome measures should include common cold incidence, vaccine safety and mortality related to the vaccine.

### Duration of symptoms of respiratory tract infections in children: systematic review [^114kHYiK]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To determine the expected duration of symptoms of common respiratory tract infections in children in primary and emergency care.

Design

Systematic review of existing literature to determine durations of symptoms of earache, sore throat, cough (including acute cough, bronchiolitis, and croup), and common cold in children.

Data Sources

PubMed, DARE, and CINAHL (all to July 2012).

Eligibility Criteria For Selecting Studies

Randomised controlled trials or observational studies of children with acute respiratory tract infections in primary care or emergency settings in high income countries who received either a control treatment or a placebo or over-the-counter treatment. Study quality was assessed with the Cochrane risk of bias framework for randomised controlled trials, and the critical appraisal skills programme framework for observational studies.

Main Outcome Measures

Individual study data and, when possible, pooled daily mean proportions and 95% confidence intervals for symptom duration. Symptom duration (in days) at which each symptom had resolved in 50% and 90% of children.

Results

Of 22,182 identified references, 23 trials and 25 observational studies met inclusion criteria. Study populations varied in age and duration of symptoms before study onset. In 90% of children, earache was resolved by seven to eight days, sore throat between two and seven days, croup by two days, bronchiolitis by 21 days, acute cough by 25 days, common cold by 15 days, and non-specific respiratory tract infections symptoms by 16 days.

Conclusions

The durations of earache and common colds are considerably longer than current guidance given to parents in the United Kingdom and the United States; for other symptoms such as sore throat, acute cough, bronchiolitis, and croup the current guidance is consistent with our findings. Updating current guidelines with new evidence will help support parents and clinicians in evidence based decision making for children with respiratory tract infections.

### SHEA practice update: infection prevention and control (IPC) in residential facilities for pediatric patients and their families [^1159ayti]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Herpes simplex viruses (HSV) cause a spectrum of clinical infections, including:
Cold sores or "fever blisters" (rashes made up of painful clusters of small, fluid-filled blisters)
Genital rashes or ulcers
Sores on the fingers or toes, called "herpetic whitlow"
A severe skin rash in individuals with eczema (called eczema herpeticum)
Primary HSV gingivostomatitis, which is common in young children and associated with many ulcers in and around the mouth, drooling, high fever, and swollen lymph nodes in the neck
Severe, life-threatening illness in young infants that can affect the brain, liver, and lungs. Newborns who are infected with HSV may or may not have a skin rash.
Encephalitis or meningitis in older children and adults.

Like varicella, the chickenpox, and shingles virus, HSV stays in the body after a person's first infection. Reactivation of HSV-related skin rashes and cold sores is common. Cases of oral HSV may not be obvious and the virus may be present in saliva even in the absence of visible sores. The virus spreads though contact with infected sores or contaminated secretions. People with cold sores should avoid kissing or having their mouths come in contact with newborns or immune compromised individuals. There is no vaccine available for HSV.

### MTORC2 confers neuroprotection and potentiates immunity during virus infection [^117J3x45]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) is a double stranded DNA virus, which causes one of the most notorious viral infections known to humanity. Globally, an estimated 3.7 billion people under age 50 (67%) harbor HSV-1 virions for life and contribute to high transmission rate via symptomatic and/or asymptomatic shedding of the virus. More commonly, HSV-1 causes fever blisters and cold sores but it is also known to cause distressing ocular infections leading to blindness in untreated patients and, in severe cases, life threatening diseases such as viral encephalitis or meningitis which in turn, may result in permanent nervous system damage in surviving patients. After primary infection, HSV-1 remains latent in neuronal tissues including the trigeminal ganglia and reactivates under stress situations. In general, about 74 viral proteins usurp the host assembly to make the host microenvironment permissive to virus replication in neurons as well as the mucosal epithelium, which forms the common site for symptomatic infection and virus shedding. During the infection, several host proteins combat HSV-1 replication by inducing innate and adaptive immune responses. Host cells also activate stress responses, including programmed cell death, which limits spread of virus. Although apoptosis plays an important role in antiviral defense mechanisms, excessive cell death in neurons during neuronal HSV-1 infection may be detrimental to host survival. This phenomenon might be one of the reasons behind severities during viral encephalitis. Exploring the role of pro-survival host factors including key signaling mechanisms may shed light on new ways to combat severe HSV-1 infections.

### Whole-body cryotherapy (extreme cold air exposure) for preventing and treating muscle soreness after exercise in adults [^115yyBaw]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Recovery strategies are often used with the intention of preventing or minimising muscle soreness after exercise. Whole-body cryotherapy, which involves a single or repeated exposure(s) to extremely cold dry air (below -100 °C) in a specialised chamber or cabin for two to four minutes per exposure, is currently being advocated as an effective intervention to reduce muscle soreness after exercise.

Objectives

To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of whole-body cryotherapy (extreme cold air exposure) for preventing and treating muscle soreness after exercise in adults.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, the British Nursing Index and the Physiotherapy Evidence Database. We also searched the reference lists of articles, trial registers and conference proceedings, handsearched journals and contacted experts. The searches were run in August 2015.

Selection Criteria

We aimed to include randomised and quasi-randomised trials that compared the use of whole-body cryotherapy (WBC) versus a passive or control intervention (rest, no treatment or placebo treatment) or active interventions including cold or contrast water immersion, active recovery and infrared therapy for preventing or treating muscle soreness after exercise in adults. We also aimed to include randomised trials that compared different durations or dosages of WBC. Our prespecified primary outcomes were muscle soreness, subjective recovery (e.g. tiredness, well-being) and adverse effects.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened search results, selected studies, assessed risk of bias and extracted and cross-checked data. Where appropriate, we pooled results of comparable trials. The random-effects model was used for pooling where there was substantial heterogeneity. We assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE.

Main Results

Four laboratory-based randomised controlled trials were included. These reported results for 64 physically active predominantly young adults (mean age 23 years). All but four participants were male. Two trials were parallel group trials (44 participants) and two were cross-over trials (20 participants). The trials were heterogeneous, including the type, temperature, duration and frequency of WBC, and the type of preceding exercise. None of the trials reported active surveillance of predefined adverse events. All four trials had design features that carried a high risk of bias, potentially limiting the reliability of their findings. The evidence for all outcomes was classified as 'very low' quality based on the GRADE criteria. Two comparisons were tested: WBC versus control (rest or no WBC), tested in four studies; and WBC versus far-infrared therapy, also tested in one study. No studies compared WBC with other active interventions, such as cold water immersion, or different types and applications of WBC. All four trials compared WBC with rest or no WBC. There was very low quality evidence for lower self-reported muscle soreness (pain at rest) scores after WBC at 1 hour (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.77, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.42 to -0.12; 20 participants, 2 cross-over trials); 24 hours (SMD -0.57, 95% CI -1.48 to 0.33) and 48 hours (SMD -0.58, 95% CI -1.37 to 0.21), both with 38 participants, 2 cross-over studies, 1 parallel group study; and 72 hours (SMD -0.65, 95% CI -2.54 to 1.24; 29 participants, 1 cross-over study, 1 parallel group study). Of note is that the 95% CIs also included either no between-group differences or a benefit in favour of the control group. One small cross-over trial (9 participants) found no difference in tiredness but better well-being after WBC at 24 hours post exercise. There was no report of adverse events. One small cross-over trial involving nine well-trained runners provided very low quality evidence of lower levels of muscle soreness after WBC, when compared with infrared therapy, at 1 hour follow-up, but not at 24 or 48 hours. The same trial found no difference in well-being but less tiredness after WBC at 24 hours post exercise. There was no report of adverse events.

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence to determine whether whole-body cryotherapy (WBC) reduces self-reported muscle soreness, or improves subjective recovery, after exercise compared with passive rest or no WBC in physically active young adult males. There is no evidence on the use of this intervention in females or elite athletes. The lack of evidence on adverse events is important given that the exposure to extreme temperature presents a potential hazard. Further high-quality, well-reported research in this area is required and must provide detailed reporting of adverse events.
