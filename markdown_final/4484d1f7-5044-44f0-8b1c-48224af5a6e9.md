## Question

How can you diagnose h pylori if a patient is currently taking a PPI?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to diagnose Helicobacter pylori in a patient who is currently taking a proton pump inhibitor, and what the safest, most accurate, and most practical approach is in that context. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how PPIs alter test performance and which tests are most affected. Then, I should verify the recommended medication washout strategy and whether it is safe to stop PPIs in this patient. Next, I will consider diagnostic options if PPIs cannot be stopped, including endoscopic biopsy-based tests and molecular methods. After that, I need to review which tests to avoid and why. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise algorithm and ensure the plan aligns with current guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the core principle: PPIs suppress gastric acid and can lower H. pylori bacterial load, leading to false-negative results on several commonly used tests, particularly urea breath testing and stool antigen testing, and to a lesser extent rapid urease testing and histology, so I need to ensure we account for that before choosing a test [^116PGjvv] [^114LFUCU] [^111Sy3XZ].

> Wait, let me verify the standard washout recommendation before jumping to alternatives. Multiple high-credibility guidelines converge on stopping PPIs for at least 2 weeks and avoiding antibiotics and bismuth for at least 4 weeks prior to testing to minimize false negatives; this applies to both initial diagnosis and test-of-cure, and is consistent across ACG 2024, Irish consensus statements, and pediatric ESPGHAN/NASPGHAN guidance, so the default should be to reschedule testing after a 2-week PPI holiday if clinically safe [^116PGjvv] [^114LFUCU] [^1175aNcR].

> Hold on, I should verify whether H2-receptor antagonists are acceptable during the washout, because patients often still need acid control. Yes, standard-dose H2RAs and antacids do not meaningfully impair urea breath test or stool antigen accuracy and can be used as bridging therapy during the 2-week PPI washout, which helps maintain symptom control without compromising test validity [^116PGjvv] [^114LFUCU].

> But wait, what if the patient cannot safely stop the PPI for 2 weeks, for example due to severe GERD, Barrett's esophagus, ongoing ulcer bleeding risk, or dual antiplatelet/anticoagulant therapy where acid suppression is protective. In that scenario, I should not rely on urea breath testing or stool antigen testing because false negatives are common under PPI therapy, so I need to pivot to endoscopic, biopsy-based diagnostics that are less affected by acid suppression, while still acknowledging that even biopsy tests can have reduced sensitivity if PPIs are on board [^114LFUCU] [^111Sy3XZ].

> I will now examine the endoscopic pathway. Let me think about optimizing biopsy-based testing: obtain both antrum and corpus biopsies to mitigate patchy distribution and PPI-associated migration of organisms, and use a rapid urease test with multiple samples to improve yield. If RUT is negative but suspicion remains high, send histology and consider culture or molecular testing, recognizing that culture is slower and technically demanding but enables susceptibility testing, whereas PCR is faster and less impacted by PPIs [^114Ss8xW] [^114LFUCU] [^115VwXCF].

> Next, I should review molecular diagnostics. PCR on gastric biopsies is less affected by PPI-induced bacterial suppression than urease-based tests and can detect low bacterial loads; importantly, the same biopsy tissue used for RUT can often be repurposed for PCR, and some centers extend this to resistance-associated mutation analysis, which is particularly useful after treatment failures or when conventional tests are negative despite high suspicion [^114LFUCU] [^114Ss8xW].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought serology might be a workaround since it is not affected by PPIs, but I should double-check that assumption. Serology detects IgG antibodies that persist for months to years and cannot distinguish active from past infection, so it should not be used for active diagnosis or test-of-cure; Choosing Wisely and ACG explicitly discourage serology for these purposes, so I need to correct that initial thought and avoid serology here [^111RYmTc] [^116PGjvv].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm. If the clinical situation allows, stop the PPI for 2 weeks, continue H2RA or antacid as needed, avoid antibiotics and bismuth for 4 weeks, and then perform a urea breath test or a monoclonal stool antigen test. If the patient cannot stop PPIs, proceed to upper endoscopy with antrum and corpus biopsies for RUT, histology, and consider PCR or culture for definitive diagnosis and susceptibility testing, interpreting negative results cautiously given PPI-related suppression [^116PGjvv] [^114LFUCU] [^114Ss8xW].

> I should confirm that this approach aligns with guideline-based quality markers. ACG and Irish consensus emphasize medication washout to preserve test accuracy, endorse UBT or stool antigen as preferred noninvasive tests when properly timed, and support biopsy-based strategies with optimized sampling when PPIs cannot be held, which matches the plan above and helps minimize false negatives while maintaining diagnostic confidence [^116PGjvv] [^114LFUCU] [^114Ss8xW].

> Finally, let me reconsider special contexts and follow-through. In patients with alarm features or those older than guideline-directed thresholds for noninvasive-first strategies, endoscopy with mapping biopsies is appropriate regardless of PPI status. After any positive result and treatment, ensure a test-of-cure using the same washout rules to accurately confirm eradication and guide next steps if infection persists [^116PGjvv] [^114LFUCU].

---

When a patient is on a PPI, **stop the PPI for at least 2 weeks** [^116PGjvv] before testing to reduce false negatives [^114LFUCU]. Use **urea breath test or stool antigen** [^1142CCb6] as first-line noninvasive tests; if PPI cannot be stopped, molecular methods (PCR) [^114Ss8xW] or multiple-site biopsy-based tests (histology, rapid urease, culture) [^115VwXCF] are preferred. Serology is not recommended for active infection [^111RYmTc] because it cannot distinguish current from past infection. If initial tests are negative but suspicion remains high, repeat testing after stopping PPIs or use alternative methods [^111Sy3XZ].

---

## Impact of PPIs on diagnostic accuracy

PPIs suppress gastric acid, reduce H. pylori load, and increase false negatives on urea-based tests and histology [^114LFUCU]. The **magnitude of false negatives** is about 30% with urea breath test or stool antigen if PPIs are not stopped [^1143Dbyc].

---

## Recommended diagnostic approach

### Step 1: discontinue PPI therapy

Hold **PPIs for at least 2 weeks** [^116PGjvv] before testing to improve accuracy; H2RAs or antacids can be used during this period [^116PGjvv].

---

### Step 2: choose appropriate diagnostic tests

#### Noninvasive tests (preferred)

- **Urea breath test (UBT)**: highly sensitive/specific; preferred after PPI washout [^114LFUCU].
- **Stool antigen test**: alternative to UBT; use monoclonal assays for best accuracy [^114LFUCU].
- **Serology**: not recommended for active infection; cannot distinguish current from past infection [^111RYmTc].

---

#### Invasive tests (if PPI cannot be stopped)

- **Histology**: gold standard; obtain antrum and corpus biopsies due to patchy distribution [^notfound].
- **Rapid urease test (RUT)**: quick; obtain antrum and corpus biopsies to improve yield [^114Ss8xW].
- **Culture**: enables susceptibility testing; obtain antrum and corpus biopsies [^115VwXCF].
- **PCR**: less affected by PPIs; high sensitivity/specificity [^114LFUCU].

---

## Summary of diagnostic approach

1. **Discontinue PPI for ≥ 2 weeks**: Reduces false negatives [^116PGjvv]
2. **Use UBT or stool antigen**: High accuracy after washout [^114LFUCU]
3. **If PPI cannot be stopped, use PCR or multiple-site biopsies**: Less affected by PPIs [^114Ss8xW]
4. **Avoid serology**: Cannot detect active infection [^111RYmTc]

---

## Special considerations

- **Refractory cases**: consider PCR or susceptibility testing if initial tests are negative but suspicion remains high [^111Sy3XZ].
- **Patient education**: explain the importance of stopping PPIs before testing to ensure accuracy [^116PGjvv].

---

## Conclusion

Stop **PPIs for at least 2 weeks** [^116PGjvv] before testing; use UBT or stool antigen as first-line tests [^112REd7m]. If PPIs cannot be stopped, use PCR or multiple-site biopsy-based tests [^114Ss8xW]. Avoid serology for active infection [^111RYmTc].

H. pylori testing and treatment

Both the ACG/CAG and NICE guidelines and the ACFD statement recommend that patients with either uninvestigated dyspepsia or FD should have a noninvasive test for H. pylori and receive eradication therapy if they test positive. NICE specifically recommend the use of either a breath test or a stool antigen test, rather than serology, after allowing a 2-week washout period for those taking PPIs. A recent indirect test comparison of data from 99 studies concluded that there was a statistically significance difference in diagnostic accuracy between urea breath test- 13 C, urea breath test- 14 C, serology, and stool antigen testing (p = 0.024). It was recommended that, in those patients who had not recently taken antibiotics or PPIs, and who had not had a gastrectomy, urea breath tests had higher diagnostic accuracy than either stool antigen or serological testing. These guidelines do not discuss the role of routine retesting to confirm successful eradication in H. pylori -positive patients with either uninvestigated dyspepsia or FD, although the Maastricht V consensus recommends retesting such patients using a urea breath test or a stool antigen test, at least 4 weeks after treatment, and having discontinued PPI therapy for at least 2 weeks, to confirm successful eradication.

### Management of Helicobacter pylori [^1164LnDP]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Gastroenterologists and many general internists and primary care physicians confront questions regarding the management of Helicobacter pylori on a daily basis. The subject remains of global interest and continue to generate debate and research. Using the search terms 'pylori and treatment' or 'pylori and management' we identified over 1000 relevant articles in PubMed published over the time period 1 January 2019 to 30 April 2020. We have selected the most highly clinically relevant of these to review here.

Recent Findings

Clinical evidence grows regarding the benefits of H. pylori eradication on gastric cancer prevention. High rates of resistance to clarithromycin and levofloxacin, correlating with treatment failure in regimens utilizing these drugs, has stimulated interest in alternative regimens as well as the need for susceptibility testing of individual patients and populations. Although many aspects of H. pylori management are well established, implementation of appropriate testing and treatment pathways remains suboptimal throughout healthcare settings.

Summary

Increased emphasis on measuring H. pylori-related clinical outcomes in practice is needed to identify implementation gaps, and to suggest means to best apply the knowledge gained on H. pylori for the prevention of gastric symptoms and disease.

Acid suppression

NICE guidelines recommend that all patients with uninvestigated dyspepsia should be offered treatment with a PPI for 4 weeks, and subsequent treatment with a H 2 -receptor antagonist (H 2 RA) if there is an inadequate response. For patients with FD, they recommend either PPI or H 2 RA treatment when symptoms persist following H. pylori eradication treatment, or for patients remaining symptomatic following a negative test for H. pylori infection. The ACG/CAG guidance differs in that, for both uninvestigated dyspepsia and FD, it recommends PPI therapy only for patients who remain symptomatic following H. pylori eradication therapy, or who are H. pylori -negative. They do not recommend H 2 RAs in uninvestigated dyspepsia, as their analysis showed a significant benefit of PPI over H 2 RA for this indication (RR of remaining symptomatic = 0.81; 95% CI 0.72–0.91). Although NICE guidelines advocate the use of H 2 RA in dyspepsia, there is no evidence to support this.

### Effective and safe proton pump inhibitor therapy in acid-related diseases – A position paper addressing benefits and potential harms of acid suppression [^113xcsf1]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Despite PPIs carrying – like any other classes of drugs – some risks, they should not be denied to patients who are likely to benefit from them merely because of concerns about putative adverse effects. There is generally some equivalence between the acceptable burden of adverse effects and the severity of the illness being treated. However, patients with acid-related diseases are often otherwise "healthy" subjects, who take drugs for a given condition. What level of undesirable effects would be acceptable for them and who will bear the cost of treating any ensuing iatrogenic disease? A number of simple and potentially effective preventive measures should be recommended for some (if not all) safety concerns in order to minimize them.

First of all, PPI therapy should be evidence based. Decisions on whether or not to initiate or continue PPI therapy should be sound and PPIs should only be prescribed when there is an appropriate clinical indication. Clinical guidelines can certainly help. In this Position Paper, we have reviewed the current available guidelines, together with the systematic reviews and meta-analyses used to generate them, and synthesized the knowledge in a number of statements (i.e. Summaries of the current evidence) and in Table 3.

Table 3
Current indications of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy

Guidelines rely on both evidence and expert opinion; they are neither infallible nor a substitute for clinical judgment. They do, however, go beyond systematic reviews to recommend what should and should not be done in specific clinical circumstances. Despite guidelines being developed to improve quality of care received by patients, they have been criticized for recommending too little or too much, and even for providing reasons for national health systems or insurance payers to deny coverage. Guidelines are often inflexible and can actually harm by leaving insufficient room for clinicians to tailor care to individual patient circumstances and medical history. What is best for patients overall, as recommended by guidelines, may be inappropriate for individuals. Only evidence-based recommendations, which consider the balance between benefits and harms, and weigh these considerations using patient (rather than expert and societal) value, should be followed in everyday clinical practice. Taking these considerations into account, we have tried to distill the current evidence and provide physicians with clear patient-oriented recommendations, beyond cost and reimbursement issues. Medicine is a rapidly evolving field, however, and the validity of guidelines will not necessarily stand the test of time: indeed, today's assumptions may no longer be valid tomorrow. Healthcare providers should therefore stay tuned and constantly update their knowledge.

### AGA clinical practice update on De-prescribing of proton pump inhibitors: expert review [^1122mWiL]. Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Proton pump inhibitor gastroprotection — examples of guidance recommendations identify populations for whom PPI gastroprotection is recommended: Patients using NSAIDs who are at moderate or high risk of upper GI bleeding (1 or more risk factors, including prior ulcer, older than 65 years, high-dose NSAID therapy, concurrent use of aspirin (including low-dose), corticosteroids, or anticoagulants); Patients with prior ulcer bleeding who require an NSAID (the NSAID should preferably be a COX-2 inhibitor); Patients with a history of upper GI bleeding or with multiple risk factors for GI bleeding who require antiplatelet therapy (risk factors include advanced age; concurrent use of anticoagulants, steroids, or NSAIDs, including aspirin; and Helicobacter pylori infection); Patients using dual antiplatelet therapy; Patients using aspirin and an oral anticoagulant; and Patients on 2 or more antithrombotic agents.

### Guidelines for the management of dyspepsia [^116HMGkn]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2005). Low credibility.

Dyspepsia is a chronic or recurrent pain or discomfort centered in the upper abdomen; patients with predominant or frequent (more than once a week) heartburn or acid regurgitation, should be considered to have gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) until proven otherwise. Dyspeptic patients over 55 yr of age, or those with alarm features should undergo prompt esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). In all other patients, there are two approximately equivalent options: (i) test and treat for Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) using a validated noninvasive test and a trial of acid suppression if eradication is successful but symptoms do not resolve or (ii) an empiric trial of acid suppression with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) for 4–8 wk. The test-and-treat option is preferable in populations with a moderate to high prevalence of H. pylori infection (≥ 10%); empirical PPI is an initial option in low prevalence situations. If initial acid suppression fails after 2–4 wk, it is reasonable to consider changing drug class or dosing. If the patient fails to respond or relapses rapidly on stopping antisecretory therapy, then the test-and-treat strategy is best applied before consideration of referral for EGD. Prokinetics are not currently recommended as first-line therapy for uninvestigated dyspepsia. EGD is not mandatory in those who remain symptomatic as the yield is low; the decision to endoscope or not must be based on clinical judgement. In patients who do respond to initial therapy, stop treatment after 4–8 wk; if symptoms recur, another course of the same treatment is justified. The management of functional dyspepsia is challenging when initial antisecretory therapy and H. pylori eradication fails. There are very limited data to support the use of low-dose tricyclic antidepressants or psychological treatments in functional dyspepsia.

### Are proton pump inhibitors a double-edged sword in the treatment ofinfection? [^115PwaoX]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection is closely associated with peptic ulcers, gastric malignancy and iron deficiency anemia. Triple eradication therapy based on either bismuth compounds or proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) is the routine method used to treat H. pylori infection. It is commonly believed that PPIs are safe and effective for patients with peptic ulcer. The adverse effects are extremely rare for PPIs, approximately 1–3% with case reports of interstitial nephritis with omeprazole, hepatitis with omeprazole and lansoprazole and disputed visual disturbances with pantoprazole and omeprazole. PPIs do not cause atrophic gastritis, although they may mildly increase serum gastric concentration and induce apoptosis. PPIs are supposed not to be associated with gastric or esophageal cancers. However, in one recent case report, a poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma with enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cell characteristics was supposed to be induced by hypergastrinemia secondary to long-term PPI use.

### Coprescribing proton-pump inhibitors with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: risks versus benefits [^116marXN]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Appropriate use of PPIs: recommendations from international guidelines

There are several guidelines that provide recommendations on the use of PPIs when NSAIDs are used.

2016 Position paper on safe PPI use

Standard-dose PPIs are recommended for patients taking ns-NSAIDs at risk for upper-GI complications (bleeding and perforation) and for those having had an episode of previous GI bleeding and prescribed selective COX2 inhibitors. In both ns-NSAID and COX2-selective NSAID users, PPI therapy reduces upper-GI symptoms, in particular dyspepsia. However, NSAID-induced adverse events in the lower GI tract are not prevented by PPIs.

American Gastroenterological Association clinical practice updates 2017

The 2017 update recommends that patients take long-term PPIs for NSAID bleeding prophylaxis if at high risk.

American College of Gastroenterology guidelines on management of bleeding ulcers

In patients with NSAID-associated bleeding ulcers who must resume NSAIDs, it is recommended to give a daily PPI together with a COX2-selective NSAID at the lowest effective dose. In patients with low-dose aspirin-associated bleeding ulcers that have been resumed on aspirin for secondary prevention, long-term daily PPI therapy should also be provided.

National Institute for Health and Care Excellence 2014 guidelines on the investigation and management of gastroesophageal reflux disease and dyspepsia in adults

In patients using NSAIDs with diagnosed peptic ulcers, a full-dose PPI or H 2 RA for 8 weeks should be offered, and NSAIDs should be stopped where possible. Further, H. pylori -eradication therapy should be offered if bacteria are present. In high-risk patients (previous ulceration) for whom NSAID continuation is necessary, a PPI together with the NSAID should be prescribed. A COX2-selective NSAID is preferred over a standard NSAID.

### The second Irish Helicobacter pylori working group consensus for the diagnosis and treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection in adult patients in Ireland [^111pVZYm]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Statement 11: bismuth quadruple therapy with a high-dose proton pump inhibitor, levofloxacin and amoxicillin for 14 days is the recommended second-line treatment. For those who received antimicrobial susceptibility testing-guided clarithromycin first-line therapy, a combination of proton pump inhibitor, bismuth, metronidazole and tetracycline can be given

Recommendation: strong; quality of evidence: low.

Results from recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses have shown no benefit of tailored over empirical second-line and rescue therapy and a failure to reliably achieve cure rates > 90%. The current European recommendations are that empirical second-line and rescue therapy for H. pylori are guided by local resistance surveillance programs and by regularly auditing eradication rates. Primary levofloxacin resistance in Europe is now in the region of 15.8% and is 18.3% (N = 21/115) locally. A local audit from Tallaght University Hospital has shown that the eradication rate for second-line levofloxacin amoxicillin triple therapy was just 68.6%, albeit with a small sample size (N = 35/51; unpublished findings). Data from the Hp-EuReg showed second-line eradication rates increased from 81 to 88% when bismuth was added to levofloxacin amoxicillin triple therapy. Further, the current European Guidelines recommend levofloxacin quadruple therapy (PPI, levofloxacin, amoxicillin and bismuth) as the second line in areas with high clarithromycin resistance. Thus, levofloxacin quadruple therapy (Table 3) is the recommended second-line therapy (Fig. 1). For those who received AST-guided clarithromycin first-line therapy, a combination of PPI, bismuth, metronidazole and tetracycline can be given. The European Medicines Agency has recommended restricted use of fluoroquinolones to infections where the therapeutic benefit outweighs the risk due to rare but serious side effects. Therefore, the use of fluoroquinolones in H. pylori treatment regimens should be restricted to second-line and rescue therapies.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines on the diagnosis and management of patients at risk of gastric adenocarcinoma [^1163kijX]. Gut (2019). Medium credibility.

Therefore, although H. pylori eradication is a feasible, efficacious and potentially cost-effective method (at least in some populations) for reducing the risk of subsequent gastric adenocarcinoma development, its use has not yet been adopted anywhere in the world. The final results of a very large Chinese trial involving more than 180 000 participants will be available within the next few years, and its results may influence future public health policy in this area, particularly in East Asian countries. However, at present, in areas of relatively low gastric cancer incidence such as the UK, we cannot currently recommend population testing and treating for H. pylori as a means for preventing subsequent gastric cancer development

Does eradication of H. pylori prevent progression to cancer?

We recommend H. pylori eradication to reduce the risk of gastric adenocarcinoma development in patients who have H. pylori-associated GA (evidence level: high quality; grade of recommendation: high; level of agreement: 100%).

### The clinician's guide to proton-pump inhibitor discontinuation [^1131cXSG]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

There is increasing concern among patients and health care providers about the associations between PPI use and a multitude of potential adverse outcomes. Therefore, clinicians need to have a rational approach both to identifying PPI users who may not have an ongoing indication for their use and on how to encourage discontinuation of unnecessary PPI use. In this paper, we will provide a detailed review of the specific indications where the benefits of ongoing PPI use is of questionable value and will review the evidence on how to maximize the likelihood of being able to successfully discontinue PPI use while minimizing symptom recurrence.

### Peptic ulcer disease today [^111H4BsG]. Nature Clinical Practice: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2006). Medium credibility.

Over the past few decades, since the introduction of histamine H(2)-receptor antagonists, proton-pump inhibitors, cyclo-oxygenase-2-selective anti-inflammatory drugs (coxibs), and eradication of Helicobacter pylori infection, the incidence of peptic ulcer disease and ulcer complications has decreased. There has, however, been an increase in ulcer bleeding, especially in elderly patients. At present, there are several management issues that need to be solved: how to manage H. pylori infection when eradication failure rates are high; how best to prevent ulcers developing and recurring in nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and aspirin users; and how to treat non-NSAID, non-H. pylori-associated peptic ulcers. Looking for H. pylori infection, the overt or surreptitious use of NSAIDs and/or aspirin, and the possibility of an acid hypersecretory state are important diagnostic considerations that determine the therapeutic approach. Combined treatment with antisecretory therapy and antibiotics for 1–2 weeks is the first-line choice for H. pylori eradication therapy. For patients at risk of developing an ulcer or ulcer complications, it is important to choose carefully which anti-inflammatory drugs, nonselective NSAIDs or coxibs to use, based on a risk assessment of the patient, especially if the high-risk patient also requires aspirin. Testing for and eradicating H. pylori infection in patients is recommended before starting NSAID therapy, and for those currently taking NSAIDs, when there is a history of ulcers or ulcer complications. Understanding the pathophysiology and best treatment strategies for non-NSAID, non-H. pylori-associated peptic ulcers presents a challenge.

### Proton pump inhibitors and the risk of gastric cancer: a systematic review, evidence synthesis and life course epidemiology perspective [^112iZU7M]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Even if PPIs are not independent carcinogens, we know PPIs are overprescribed (up to 70%), often as maintenance therapy, while the large majority of indications warrant short-term use. Yet, many physicians globally fail to re-assess the need for treatment, contributing to polypharmacy and potential drug-drug interactionsand unwarranted long-term health effects. We do acknowledge PPIs can be life-saving drugs (eg, haemorrhaging peptic ulcers) and may improve quality of life, at least temporarily. Yet, PPI utilisation is still increasing globally and also in Sweden, among all age groups. Although the stomach is not as acidic during foetal life and the first months of life, we know insufficiently how and how long PPIs and other drugs impact the many physiological processes during early life. Most research regarding gastric and other cancers is, however, restricted to adult and elderly populations. Although differences by sex and/or age were only explored in two of the included studies, we do worry about potential longer-term effects in younger individuals, particularly children (antenatal and early-life exposure)and young adults. Our own recent study on antenatal and early-life exposure to antibiotics and PPIs did suggest that PPI use before age two might be associated with an overall increased risk of childhood cancer, although power was insufficient to address specific cancer types. Even if gastric cancer incidence is decreasing globally (mainly attributed to the eradication of H. pylori), the incidence seems to increase in younger adults in low-incidence regions, and it is not ruled out yet if PPIs may be involved. Another issue specifically for younger individuals is the potential delayed diagnosis if PPIs are initiated for vague gastrointestinal symptoms without alarming symptoms such as weight loss. Besides the lower suspicion for cancer in younger individuals, there may be age cut-offs for urgent referral for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. The American and Canadian Colleges of Gastroenterology guidelines suggest referral for gastroscopy in case of new onset dyspepsia from 60 years and above to exclude gastro-intestinal malignancy. For those under age 60, it is only recommended to have non-invasive assessment of H. pylori but no assessment for malignancy, although family history and regional gastric cancer prevalence may be considered. The National Institute for health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines recommend urgent referral for endoscopy in case of dyspepsia/reflux if they have dysphagia (all ages) or are at least 55 years old presenting with weight loss.

### Current concepts in the management of Helicobacter pylori infection: the maastricht III consensus report [^114Q49z7]. Gut (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Guidelines on the management of Helicobacter pylori, which cover indications for management and treatment strategies, were produced in 2000.

Aims

To update the guidelines at the European Helicobacter Study Group (EHSG) Third Maastricht Consensus Conference, with emphasis on the potential of H pylori eradication for the prevention of gastric cancer.

Results

Eradication of H pylori infection is recommended in (a) patients with gastroduodenal diseases such as peptic ulcer disease and low grade gastric, mucosa associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma; (b) patients with atrophic gastritis; (c) first degree relatives of patients with gastric cancer; (d) patients with unexplained iron deficiency anaemia; and (e) patients with chronic idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. Recurrent abdominal pain in children is not an indication for a "test and treat" strategy if other causes are excluded. Eradication of H pylori infection (a) does not cause gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) or exacerbate GORD, and (b) may prevent peptic ulcer in patients who are naïve users of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). H pylori eradication is less effective than proton pump inhibitor (PPI) treatment in preventing ulcer recurrence in long term NSAID users. In primary care a test and treat strategy using a non-invasive test is recommended in adult patients with persistent dyspepsia under the age of 45. The urea breath test, stool antigen tests, and serological kits with a high accuracy are non-invasive tests which should be used for the diagnosis of H pylori infection. Triple therapy using a PPI with clarithromycin and amoxicillin or metronidazole given twice daily remains the recommended first choice treatment. Bismuth-containing quadruple therapy, if available, is also a first choice treatment option. Rescue treatment should be based on antimicrobial susceptibility.

Conclusion

The global burden of gastric cancer is considerable but varies geographically. Eradication of H pylori infection has the potential to reduce the risk of gastric cancer development.

### Proton-pump inhibitors: understanding the complications and risks [^115NAEHa]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2017). Medium credibility.

Proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) are the most effective therapy for the full spectrum of gastric-acid-related diseases. However, in the past decade, a steadily increasing list of complications following long-term use of PPIs has been reported. Their potent acid-suppressive action induces several structural and functional changes within the gastric mucosa, including fundic gland polyps, enterochromaffin-like cell hyperplasia and hypergastrinaemia, which can be exaggerated in the presence of Helicobacter pylori infection. As discussed in this Review, most associations of PPIs with severe adverse events are not based on sufficient evidence because of confounding factors and a lack of plausible mechanisms. Thus, a causal relationship remains unproven in most associations, and further studies are needed. Awareness of PPI-associated risks should not lead to anxiety in patients but rather should induce the physician to consider the appropriate dosing and duration of PPI therapy, including long-term monitoring strategies in selected groups of patients because of their individual comorbidities and risk factors.

### Proton pump inhibitor or testing for Helicobacter pylori as the first step for patients presenting with dyspepsia? A cluster-randomized trial [^1157GRtQ]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

The optimal approach for management of patients with dyspepsia has not been determined. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of three strategies for management of dyspepsia: empirical antisecretory therapy, testing for Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori), or a combination of the two.

Methods

Cluster-randomized trial in general practices. Initial treatment with proton pump inhibitor (PPI) was performed in 222 patients, H. pylori test-and-eradicate in 250 patients, and PPI followed by H. pylori-testing if symptoms improved in 250 patients. Symptoms, quality of life, patient satisfaction, and use of resources were recorded during a 1-yr follow-up.

Results

The prevalence of H. pylori infection was 24%. We found no difference among the three strategies (p = 0.16) in terms of the proportion of days without dyspeptic symptoms. After 1 yr gastrointestinal symptom scores and quality-of-life scores had improved significantly and equally in the three groups (p < 0.001), but no statistically significant differences were found among the groups. The mean use of endoscopies per patient after 1 yr was higher in the PPI group (0.36 [95% CI 0.30–0.43]) than in the test-and-eradicate group (0.28 [95% CI 0.23–0.34]) and the combination group (0.22 [95% CI 0.17–0.27]), p = 0.02. H. pylori-positive patients given eradication therapy had more days without dyspeptic symptoms (p < 0.001), used less antisecretory therapy (p < 0.01), and were more satisfied (p < 0.001) than H. pylori-negative patients.

Conclusion

The strategies based on H. pylori test enjoyed similar symptom resolution, but reduced endoscopic workload and lower 1-yr total costs compared with empirical antisecretory therapy.

### American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy guideline on the diagnosis and management of GERD: summary and recommendations [^116A4fiT]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2025). High credibility.

ASGE guideline — Recommendation 4 for proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy in GERD states that in patients with symptomatic and confirmed GERD with predominant heartburn symptoms, the ASGE recommends medical management with PPIs at the lowest possible dose for the shortest possible period of time while initiating discussion about long-term management options (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). In patients with suboptimal clinical response to PPI therapy, the ASGE suggests testing CYP2C19 polymorphism and adjusting PPI dosage and/or selection accordingly (conditional recommendation, very-low-quality evidence). Best practice advice includes that patients on chronic PPI therapy (> 6 months) should be considered for optimization and de-escalation, providers should carefully consider risks, benefits, and alternatives of PPI use, and prescribers should be aware that adverse events in prospective data have been limited to a modest increased risk of enteric infections with a need for robust long-term data to confirm or refute other putative adverse events.

### Clarithromycin sustained-release tablet may be an improper therapy for the eradication of… [^114LULUA]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a gram-negative bacterium that occurs in the gastric mucosa in approximately 50% of the Chinese population. The majority of bacteria are located deep in the mucus, and they are close to the surface of the epithelium and can induce gastritis, gastric ulcer, pancreatitis, and cancer. Diagnosis of H. pylori infection typically involves the utilization of gastric endoscopy and biopsy for immunohistochemical analysis. However, the complexity of the diagnostic procedures limits their use in some patients. As a noninvasive and rapid screening tool, the 13 C-urea breath test (13C-UBT) is increasingly preferred owing to its convenience, leading to an increase in diagnosis. Following diagnosis, treatment typically involves high doses of antibiotics and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) over extended periods. Over the past few decades, various therapies, including double, triple, and even quadruple regimens, have been extensively reviewed and discussed owing to the challenge of achieving complete eradication of H. pylori in all cases. Numerous studies have confirmed that antibiotic resistance in H. pylori and poor drug adherence on the part of patients could be risk factors for the failure of H. pylori therapy. – Antibiotic resistance is progressively posing greater challenges, particularly in China. – With declining eradication rates, bismuth has been incorporated into traditional therapies. Multiple studies have demonstrated that although the resistance rate to antibiotics has significantly increased, bismuth addition can overcome its resistance to a certain degree and achieve a relatively satisfactory eradication efficacy. The safety of bismuth-containing regimens has been confirmed, eliminating the need for dose adjustments for individual drugs when combined with bismuth. The Maastricht V Consensus Report recommended bismuth-containing quadruple therapy as the first-line eradication regimen for geographic regions with high clarithromycin resistance. At present, bismuth-containing quadruple therapy is the most commonly used regimen to eradicate H. pylori infection in China.

ACG and CAG guideline — age-based endoscopy and initial testing for dyspepsia use the following abbreviations: H. pylori (Helicobacter pylori) and PPI (proton pump inhibitor). We suggest dyspepsia patients aged 60 or over have an endoscopy to exclude upper gastrointestinal neoplasia. Conditional recommendation, very low quality evidence. We do not suggest endoscopy to investigate alarm features for dyspepsia patients under the age of 60 to exclude upper GI neoplasia. Conditional recommendation, moderate quality evidence. We recommend dyspepsia patients under the age of 60 should have a non-invasive test for H. pylori, and therapy for H. pylori infection if positive. Strong recommendation, high quality evidence. We recommend dyspepsia patients under the age of 60 should have empirical PPI therapy if they are H. pylori-negative or who remain symptomatic after H. pylori eradication therapy. Strong recommendation, high quality evidence.

### Diagnosis of Helicobacter pylori infection in the proton pump inhibitor era [^111Sy3XZ]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Proton pump inhibitors (PPI) are a major cause of false-negative Helicobacter pylori test results. Detecting PPI use and stopping it 2 weeks before testing is the preferred approach to improve the reliability of H pylori diagnostic tests. Immunoblot and molecular methods may be useful for the detection of H pylori infection in difficult cases. When conventional tests are negative and eradication is strongly indicated, empirical H pylori treatment should be considered. In this article, an updated critical review of the usefulness of the various invasive and noninvasive tests in the context of extensive PPI use is provided.

### Helicobacter pylori: diagnosis and treatment [^111HNDXs]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Multiple diagnostic methods and treatment strategies have been developed to detect and treat the Helicobacter pylori infection. Many of them have stood the test of time; others lost their value with the introduction of new test and treatment modalities. This review focuses on the current diagnostic methods and their clinical implications, as well as on established and novel treatment strategies.

Recent Findings

The increasing antimicrobial resistance has resulted in a decline of the success rate of recommended eradication regimens. The current guidelines recommend as first-line treatment clarithromycin, amoxicillin or metronidazole, and proton pump inhibitor twice daily, but recent studies have demonstrated an increasing eradication failure with these regimens. Several treatment modifications have been adopted regarding duration and combination of substances.

Summary

The currently recommended first-line treatments are effective and well tolerated. In areas with high antimicrobial resistance rates, new antibiotic combinations and modifications in the sequence of drug administration are proposed as alternative treatment options to standard triple therapy. Future treatment strategies have to focus on regional antimicrobial resistance adopted treatment selection and the development of new antibiotics.

### The second Irish Helicobacter pylori working group consensus for the diagnosis and treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection in adult patients in Ireland [^114LFUCU]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Statement 7: posteradication treatment testing must be performed. If gastroscopy is not required, a urea breath test is recommended for posteradication treatment testing. If the urea breath test is unavailable, the monoclonal stool antigen test is an alternative if locally validated

Recommendation: strong; quality of evidence: high.

In line with Maastricht VI guidelines, testing for H. pylori eradication should be performed at least 4–6 weeks following the completion of any therapy for H. pylori. This period of time is required to exclude the possibility of bacterial suppression leading to false negative results. The UBT is recommended for posteradication testing where available. The monoclonal stool antigen test is an alternative (see statement 2). As antibodies to H. pylori persist for months following infection, serology is not recommended for eradication confirmation. If endoscopy is performed, biopsy sampling should be performed as described in statements 3–5.

Statement 8: proton pump inhibitors significantly reduce the accuracy of the recommended H. pylori tests; therefore, proton pump inhibitors should be stopped 14 days before testing unless PCR testing is available

Recommendation: strong; quality of evidence: high.

PPIs should be avoided 2 weeks before diagnostic testing by the UBT, stool antigen test, histology, the RUT or culture as they decrease the bacterial load, thus increasing the risk of false negative results. However, the working group notes that as PPIs are now available over the counter, many patients do not avoid PPIs before H. pylori testing. As it is less affected by PPI use, PCR is a diagnostic option that overcomes this problem but may not always be available.

H 2 receptor antagonists may slightly decrease bacterial load, but their use is not considered a problem during H. pylori diagnosis. Antimicrobials and bismuth should be avoided for 4 weeks before testing as these agents also suppress infection and reduce test sensitivity.

### Key points from the revised maastricht consensus report: the impact on general practice [^115d831M]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2001). Low credibility.

The Maastricht 2 Consensus Report features evidence-based recommendations for the management of Helicobacter pylori infection. Strongly recommended indications for H. pylori eradication include duodenal and gastric ulcer, mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma, atrophic gastritis, post gastric cancer resection, first-degree relation to gastric cancer patients, and patient's wishes. Advisable indications include functional dyspepsia, with the statement that eradication can lead to long-term improvement of symptoms in a subset of patients. Because H. pylori eradication does not cause gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) in most patients, or exacerbate existing GORD, H. pylori should be eradicated in patients requiring long-term acid suppression. Also advisable is H. pylori eradication before administration of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), although this alone may be insufficient to reduce recurrent bleeding or enhance ulcer healing in patients receiving antisecretory therapy who continue to take NSAIDs. Maastricht 2 also introduced the concept of the 'treatment package' that considers first- and second-line eradication therapies together. A 'search and treat' strategy should be considered in patients with peptic ulcers; for patients with uncomplicated duodenal ulcer, administration of proton pump inhibitors can be limited to the period of antibiotic treatment.

### Management of Helicobacter pylori-related disorders [^117R8hfY]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2012). Low credibility.

The discovery of Helicobacter pylori has opened new opportunities in the management of gastrointestinal disorders, with the cure of chronic ulcer disease now being possible for the first time. The 1994 United States National Institutes of Health Consensus Conference recommended that patients with duodenal or gastric ulcers unrelated to the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) should be given eradication therapy. These guidelines were refined at a conference held recently in Maastricht. The updated guidelines strongly recommend treatment in patients with duodenal or gastric ulcer disease, low-grade mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) gastric lymphoma, gastritis with severe macro-or microscopic changes and after resection of early gastric cancer. Despite a lack of hard scientific evidence, the guidelines also suggest that eradication treatment is advisable in patients with unequivocally diagnosed functional dyspepsia, a family history of gastric cancer, long-term treatment with proton-pump inhibitors for gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD), planned or existing NSAID treatment, after gastric surgery for ulcer or cancer, or if the patient wants to be treated. Many different therapeutic regimens have been used previously, but at present the best treatment is proton-pump inhibitor-based triple therapy, comprising a proton-pump inhibitor plus two drugs out of clarithromycin, a nitroimidazole and amoxycillin. One-week low-dose triple therapy cures 85–95% of infected patients.

### Complications of proton pump inhibitor therapy [^1144tdE6]. Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Safety issues associated with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) have recently attracted widespread media and lay attention. Gastroenterologists are frequently asked about the appropriateness of PPI therapy for specific patients. Furthermore, some patients may have had PPI therapy discontinued abruptly or inappropriately due to safety concerns. Faced with such a wide variety of potentially serious adverse consequences, prescribers need to evaluate the evidence objectively to discern the likelihood that any reported association might actually be causal. Here, we review many of the proposed adverse consequences of PPI therapy and apply established criteria for the determination of causation. We also consider the potential contribution of residual confounding in many of the reported studies. Evidence is inadequate to establish causal relationships between PPI therapy and many of the proposed associations. Residual confounding related to study design and the overextrapolation of quantitatively small estimates of effect size have probably led to much of the current controversy about PPI safety. In turn, this has caused unnecessary concern among patients and prescribers. The benefits of PPI therapy for appropriate indications need to be considered, along with the likelihood of the proposed risks. Patients with a proven indication for a PPI should continue to receive it in the lowest effective dose. PPI dose escalation and continued chronic therapy in those unresponsive to initial empiric therapy is discouraged.

### The second Irish Helicobacter pylori working group consensus for the diagnosis and treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection in adult patients in Ireland [^114Ss8xW]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Statement 4: a corpus and antrum biopsy sample should be taken for the rapid urease test

Recommendation: strong; quality of evidence: moderate.

A biopsy from the antrum and the corpus should be taken for the RUT to account for the patchy distribution of H. pylori, which can occur due to proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use. Emerging evidence from abroad and from Ireland suggests that testing the antrum and corpus biopsies either separately or combined within the same test significantly increases the diagnostic accuracy of the RUT. Additionally, the combined approach reduces the reaction time of the test, resulting in a more rapid diagnosis.

Accumulating evidence also supports the reuse of RUT biopsy samples for DNA isolation and the diagnosis of H. pylori infection by molecular methods such as PCR. This eliminates the need to take additional biopsies specifically for PCR and provides the opportunity to perform antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) by analysing the H. pylori DNA for resistance-associated mutations (see statement 6). Another advantage of molecular methods for the detection of H. pylori is that they are less affected by PPI use than the other H. pylori detection methods. Studies evaluating the feasibility and accuracy of reusing rapid urease test biopsies for PCR-based H. pylori detection and antimicrobial sensitivity testing are warranted in the Irish Healthcare setting.

Apparent strong associations may reflect bias, as "a strong association (ORs > 4) between PPI usage and esophageal adenocarcinoma" is "likely due to confounding by indication", and reported links with community-acquired pneumonia "may well have been the result of protopathic bias".

### Effective and safe proton pump inhibitor therapy in acid-related diseases – A position paper addressing benefits and potential harms of acid suppression [^116fW86B]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Since some drug classes (e.g. NSAIDs, calcium channel blockers, corticosteroids, ACE inhibitors, and methylxanthines) can induce dyspeptic symptoms, a careful evaluation of the current drug therapy is of paramount importance: dyspeptogenic medications should be withdrawn whenever possible. In patients with NSAID-associated dyspepsia, PPIs are effective and should be given also with the aim of preventing adverse GI events (see below).

The role of H. pylori in FD is supported by data from meta-analyses showing that H. pylori eradication resulted in a statistically significant benefit compared with placebo (relative risk of remaining dyspeptic 0.90; NNT = 13). However, short-term benefit is often not evident since symptom relief becomes significant only some (up to 6) months after successful cure of the infection. Furthermore, PPIs represent a key component of all the commonly used eradication regimens (triple, quadruple, sequential, concomitant or hybrid therapies).

It has been estimated that the H. pylori "test and treat" strategy is cost-effective in those regions where prevalence of the infection is > 20%, as in Italy, and that the advantage persists at long-term follow-up. Unfortunately, no predictive factors for clinical benefit have been identified, so that eradication treatments should be attempted in all dyspeptic patients. H. pylori should be investigated with either non-invasive tests or upper endoscopy, according to the age of the patient and the presence of alarm symptoms.

In patients with dyspeptic symptoms persisting despite successful eradication or naïve uninfected patients with EPS, PPI therapy can be attempted, an approach achieving a success rate of 34% (NNT = 10, 95% confidence interval, 7–33). PPIs are particularly effective when overlapping reflux symptoms are present, while no significant benefit occurs in dyspeptic patients with PDS. It is worth emphasizing that the effect of PPIs in FD occurs at standard doses and, since meta-analyses found no dose-response effect, escalating the dose in non-responders to standard doses should not be considered. If breakthrough symptoms occur, antacids or alginate-containing formulations may be used. Differentely from GERD, a long-term therapy with PPIs in FD is not indicated. After successful treatment, a tapering strategy rather than abrupt discontinuation is preferred. Although symptoms may recur in nearly 70% of patients within 1-year follow-up, re-starting treatment only in these patients is more advantageous than a continuous and expensive treatment, prescribed in all cases.

### The Irish Helicobacter pylori working group consensus for the diagnosis and treatment of H. pylori infection in adult patients in Ireland [^111k3mtX]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Irish eradication rates for Helicobacter pylori are decreasing and there is an increase in the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. These trends call into question current management strategies.

Objective

To establish an Irish Helicobacter pylori Working Group (IHPWG) to assess, revise and tailor current available recommendations.

Methods

Experts in the areas of gastroenterology and microbiology were invited to join the IHPWG. Questions of relevance to diagnosis, first-line and rescue therapy were developed using the PICO system. A literature search was performed. The 'Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation' approach was then used to rate the quality of available evidence and grade the resulting recommendations.

Results

Key resultant IHPWG statements (S), the strength of recommendation and quality of evidence include S8: standard triple therapy for 7 days' duration can no longer be recommended (strong and moderate). S9: 14 days of clarithromycin-based triple therapy with a high-dose proton pump inhibitor (PPI) is recommended as first-line therapy. Bismuth quadruple therapy for 14 days is an alternative if available (strong and moderate). S12: second-line therapy depends on the first-line treatment and should not be the same treatment. The options are (a) 14 days of levofloxacin-based therapy with high-dose PPI, (b) 14 days of clarithromycin-based triple therapy with high-dose PPI or (c) bismuth quadruple therapy for 14 days (strong and moderate). S13: culture and antimicrobial susceptibility testing should be performed following two treatment failures (weak and low/very low).

Conclusion

These recommendations are intended to provide the most relevant current best-practice guidelines for the management of H. pylori infection in adults in Ireland.

### The second Irish Helicobacter pylori working group consensus for the diagnosis and treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection in adult patients in Ireland [^115RsvsJ]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Statement 12: 14-day rifabutin, amoxicillin triple therapy with high-dose proton pump inhibitor is the recommended rescue therapy. Alternatively, a combination of high-dose proton pump inhibitor and bismuth with two antibiotics not previously prescribed can be used

Recommendation: strong; quality of evidence: low.

Current European Guidelines recommend empirical rifabutin triple therapy (Table 3) as the rescue therapy for H. pylori. Irish data on the efficacy of rifabutin-based rescue therapy are lacking but primary resistance is below 10% in Ireland, as well as in Europe overall. Although rifabutin has been associated with myelotoxicity, this adverse event is rare and reversible. Data from the Hp-EuReg support the use of rifabutin-based triple therapy as an effective and well-tolerated strategy following one or several failures of H. pylori eradication therapy. The widespread use of rifabutin should be avoided to prevent resistance selection pressure on Mycobacterium tuberculosis. We, therefore, recommend reserving rifabutin use for third-line and subsequent H. pylori eradication attempts (Fig. 1). As an alternative to rifabutin triple therapy, a combination of high-dose PPI and bismuth with two antibiotics not previously prescribed for 14 days may be used for rescue therapy.

### Refractory gastrooesophageal reflux disease [^1164yTjE]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2008). Low credibility.

The introduction of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) has facilitated the treatment of gastrooesophageal reflux disease (GORD) enormously; however, treatment of GORD still fails in a small proportion of patients. This small proportion of therapy-resistant patients encompasses a substantial part of the working load of physicians and has become a common clinical problem. A strong variability in acid-suppressive effect of PPI treatment exists depending on compliance, Helicobacter pylori status and genotype. Nocturnal acid breakthrough does not seem to be a major determinant of refractory GORD. Recent data, however, show that PPI-refractory GORD can result from nonacid reflux episodes. It is wise to reconsider the diagnosis of GORD in patients who are PPI-refractory. Most patients in whom a PPI is not effective do not have GORD, instead they suffer from other disorders such as functional dyspepsia. If after a thorough history is taken the suspicion of GORD is still high, the next step would be to perform upper endoscopy and reflux monitoring. In case patients truly have PPI-refractory GORD, therapy can be aimed at oesophageal hypersensitivity or a surgical solution can be sought.

Methods

Data review, assessment of evidence and revision of consensus statements

The IHPWG met on 22 June 2023, to discuss the recent literature and national data relating to the management of H. pylori. It was agreed that there was a need to update the Irish guidelines. Using a similar approach to that of the Maastricht VI guidelines, the Delphi process was used to develop revised consensus statements in relation to three key domains: diagnosis of H. pylori infection in symptomatic adults (domain 1), first-line treatment of H. pylori infection (domain 2) and second-line and rescue therapy for H. pylori infection (domain 3). First, this involved an in-depth review of the recent relevant national data, the published literature and current European and international guidelines to identify the best evidence to support each recommendation. Revised recommendations were drafted and shared with the group. On 29 November 2023, group members were asked to vote on whether they agreed with each recommendation. If there was < 80% agreement with the relevance of a recommendation, it was re-phrased, and another vote took place. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to rate the quality of the available evidence and the strength of the resulting recommendations according to the criteria in Table 1. Aspects related to the implementation of the recommendations in clinical practise in Ireland were also considered. The resulting recommendations are summarised in Table 2.

### Diagnosis and therapy in the era of antimicrobial stewardship [^115nUxME]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Test-of-cure

The classic three-step approach to H. pylori therapy is accurate diagnosis of an active infection, therapy, and confirmation of cure. It is critical that each course of therapy be followed by a test-of-cure, preferably using noninvasive testing such as the stool antigen or urea breath test (UBT). To prevent false negative results, care must be taken to follow the recommendations regarding stopping PPIs, antibiotics, and bismuth for an adequate time for testing. The test-of-cure provides direct and immediate feedback regarding outcome and informs clinicians regarding which therapies are successful and which are failing. Ideally, test-of-cure data would also be shared with colleagues to expand the local and regional knowledge base. It retrospect, it is amazing that this simple approach was not immediately recognized as a critical element able to provide immediate and local feedback to clinicians. As such, decades of local treatment failures have been recorded and published as observations rather than as critical opportunities for providing better care.

AGA Clinical Practice Update — best practice advice on discontinuing proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) states that the decision to discontinue PPIs should be based solely on the lack of an indication for PPI use, and not because of concern for PPI-associated adverse events (PAAEs). It further specifies that the presence of a PAAE or a history of a PAAE in a current PPI user is not an independent indication for PPI withdrawal, and that the presence of underlying risk factors for the development of an adverse event associated with PPI use should also not be an independent indication for PPI withdrawal. Supporting context notes that reported associations between PPIs and PAAEs are not necessarily causal and that no RCT has yet demonstrated that PPI users have an increased incidence of any of the PAAEs.

### Joint ESPGHAN / NASPGHAN guidelines for the management of Helicobacter pylori in children and adolescents (update 2016) [^111wixtr]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2017). Medium credibility.

ESPGHAN/NASPGHAN pediatric Helicobacter pylori — pre-testing and diagnostic criteria are specified as follows: We recommend that before testing for H pylori, patients wait at least 2 weeks after stopping proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and 4 weeks after stopping antibiotics. We recommend that the diagnosis of H pylori infection should be based on either (a) histopathology (H pylori–positive gastritis) plus at least 1 other positive biopsy-based test or (b) positive culture. We recommend that for the diagnosis of H pylori infection at upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, at least 6 gastric biopsies be obtained. We recommend that antimicrobial sensitivity be obtained for the infecting H pylori strain(s), and eradication therapy tailored accordingly.

### Appropriate interval for assessing H. pylori eradication… [^114SbGfT]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

Currently, only patients with complicated gastric or duodenal ulcers or other serious gastric conditions are routinely tested for H. pylori infection. However, a number of medical organizations now recommend that young, otherwise healthy patients with uncomplicated dyspeptic symptoms should be tested and treated for H. pylori infection as well. Assessing for eradication can be reliably accomplished with histology, rapid urease testing and urea breath testing, but these tests are typically performed no less than four weeks after the completion of treatment. Chey and colleagues evaluated the effectiveness of the 14C-UBT at two weeks after treatment and compared those results with results obtained four to six weeks after treatment. Patients with active H. pylori infection received proton-pump inhibitor –based treatment for 10 to 14 days. Eradication was assessed using the 14C-UBT at two weeks and again at four to six weeks after treatment. A positive test for H.

pylori was a carbon dioxide excretion of more than 200 disintegrations per minute, a negative test was less than 50 dpm and an equivocal test was 50 to 200 dpm. Confidence intervals for the two-week UBT were established by using the four-to six-week UBT as the gold standard. A total of 82 patients completed the protocol. Four had an equivocal UBT test and were excluded. Of the remaining patients, 68 had a negative UBT at four to six weeks. Of the 10 patients who had a positive UBT at four to six weeks, nine also had a positive test at two weeks. Given these data, the two-week UBT had a sensitivity of 90 percent, a specificity of 99 percent and an accuracy rate of 97 percent. In addition, patients with a positive UBT at four weeks also had lower CO. 2 excretion levels at two weeks than at four weeks. The authors conclude that the results of the two-week 14C-UBT for H.

pylori eradication were similar to those obtained at the standard four- to six-week follow-up interval. Early testing for eradication allows physicians to identify treatment failures sooner and to provide appropriate interventions in a more timely manner.

### Optimum duration of regimens for Helicobacter pylori eradication [^116VE7dV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The optimal duration for Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) eradication therapy is controversial, with recommendations ranging from 7 to 14 days. Several systematic reviews have attempted to address this issue but have given conflicting results and limited their analysis to proton pump inhibitor (PPI), two antibiotics (PPI triple) therapy. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the optimal duration of multiple H. pylori eradication regimens.

Objectives

The primary objective was to assess the relative effectiveness of different durations (7, 10 or 14 days) of a variety of regimens for eradicating H. pylori. The primary outcome was H. pylori persistence. The secondary outcome was adverse events.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL were searched up to December 2011 to identify eligible randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We also searched the proceedings of six conferences from 1995 to 2011, dissertations and theses, and grey literature. There were no language restrictions applied to any search.

Selection Criteria

Only parallel group RCTs assessing the efficacy of one to two weeks duration of first line H. pylori eradication regimens in adults were eligible. Within each regimen, the same combinations of drugs at the same dose were compared over different durations. Studies with at least two arms comparing 7, 10, or 14 days were eligible. Enrolled participants needed to be diagnosed with at least one positive test for H. pylori on the basis of a rapid urease test (RUT), histology, culture, urea breath test (UBT), or a stool antigen test (HpSA) before treatment. Eligible trials needed to confirm eradication of H. pylori as their primary outcome at least 28 days after completion of eradication treatment. Trials using only serology or a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to determine H. pylori infection or eradication were excluded.

Data Collection and Analysis

Study eligibility and data extraction were performed by two independent review authors. Data analyses were performed within each type of intervention, for both primary and secondary outcomes. The relative risk (RR) and number needed to treat (NNT)/number needed to harm (NNTH) according to duration of therapy were calculated using the outcomes of H. pylori persistence and adverse events. A random-effects model was used. Subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses were planned a priori.

Main Results

In total, 75 studies met the inclusion criteria. Eight types of regimens were reported with at least two comparative eligible durations. They included: PPI + two antibiotics triple therapy (n = 59), PPI bismuth-based quadruple therapy (n = 6), PPI + three antibiotics quadruple therapy (n = 1), PPI dual therapy (n = 2), histamine H2-receptor antagonist (H₂RA) bismuth quadruple therapy (n = 3), H₂RA bismuth-based triple therapy (n = 2), H₂RA + two antibiotics triple therapy (n = 3), and bismuth + two antibiotics triple therapy (n = 2). Some studies provided data for more than one regimen or more than two durations. For the PPI triple therapy, 59 studies with five regimens were reported: PPI + clarithromycin + amoxicillin (PCA); PPI + clarithromycin + a nitroimidazole (PCN); PPI + amoxicillin + nitroimidazole (PAN); PPI + amoxicillin + a quinolone (PAQ); and PPI + amoxicillin + a nitrofuran (PANi). Regardless of type and dose of antibiotics, increased duration of PPI triple therapy from 7 to 14 days significantly increased the H. pylori eradication rate (45 studies, 72.9% versus 81.9%), the RR for H. pylori persistence was 0.66 (95% CI 0.60 to 0.74), NNT was 11 (95% CI 9 to 14). Significant effects were seen in the subgroup of PCA (34 studies, RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.75; NNT 12, 95% CI 9 to 16); PAN (10 studies, RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.86; NNT = 11, 95% CI 8 to 25); and in PAQ (2 studies, RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.83; NNT 3, 95% CI 2 to 10); but not in PCN triple therapy (4 studies, RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.07). Significantly increased eradication rates were also seen for PPI triple therapy with 10 versus 7 days (24 studies, 79.9% versus 75.7%; RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.89; NNT 21, 95% CI 15 to 38) and 14 versus 10 days (12 studies, 84.4% versus 78.5%; RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.90; NNT 17, 95% CI 11 to 46); especially in the subgroup of PAC for 10 versus 7 days (17 studies, RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.91) and for 14 versus 10 days (10 studies, RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.91). A trend towards increased H. pylori eradication rates was seen with increased duration of PCN for 10 versus 7 days, and of PAN for 10 versus 7 days and 14 versus 10 days, though this was not statistical significant. The proportion of patients with adverse events, defined by authors, was marginally significantly increased only between 7 days and 14 days (15.5% versus 19.4%; RR 1.21, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.37; NNTH 31, 95% CI 18 to 104) but not for other duration comparisons. The proportion of patients discontinuing treatment due to adverse events was not significantly different between treatment durations. Only limited data were reported for different durations of regimens other than PPI triple therapy. No significant difference of the eradication rate was seen for all regimens according to different durations except for H₂RA bismuth quadruple therapy, where a significantly higher eradication rate was seen for 14 days versus 7 days, however only one study reported outcome data.

Authors' Conclusions

Increasing the duration of PPI-based triple therapy increases H. pylori eradication rates. For PCA, prolonging treatment duration from 7 to 10 or from 10 to 14 days is associated with a significantly higher eradication rate. The optimal duration of therapy for PCA and PAN is at least 14 days. More data are needed to confirm if there is any benefit of increasing the duration of therapy for PCN therapy. Information is limited for regimens other than PPI triple therapy; more studies are needed to draw meaningful conclusions for optimal duration of other H. pylori eradication regimens.

Regarding specific circumstances for Helicobacter pylori infection, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients (confirmation of eradication), ESPGHAN/NASPGHAN 2024 guidelines recommend to wait at least 2 weeks after discontinuing PPIs and 4 weeks after discontinuing antibiotics and bismuth salts before noninvasive testing for confirmation of H. pylori eradication.

Statement 5: if Helicobacter pylori cultures are required, a corpus and an antrum biopsy should be taken

Recommendation: strong; quality of evidence: moderate.

The culture of H. pylori from biopsy specimens enables diagnosis and provides the opportunity for AST. While culture is very specific, it is time-consuming and requires expertise in the clinical microbiology laboratory. Culture success rates range from as low as 55% to up to 93%. Culture success is influenced by PPI use, the biopsy collection medium, sample transport conditions and contamination of the samples with other microorganisms. Dedicated biopsies should be taken from both the antrum and the corpus to increase culture success. This recommendation has been supported locally by a study carried out at Tallaght University Hospital showing that H. pylori was successfully cultured in a significantly higher number of cases when combined antrum and corpus biopsy sampling was used compared with a single antrum biopsy [64.4% (n = 94/146) vs. 49.3% (36/73); P = 0.04)]. In support of a combined biopsy protocol, differences in the antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of H. pylori isolated from the corpus compared with the antrum have been reported. Thus, sampling from both sites avoids resistant H. pylori being missed by the collection of only a single sample from one site of the stomach.

To prevent contact with air and desiccation, biopsy specimens for culture should be transported in leak-proof containers containing a dedicated transport medium (e.g. Portagerm pylori, bioMérieux, Marcy-L'Etoile, France). Biopsies should be processed for culture as early as possible following endoscopy, ideally within 6 h. Storage at 4 °C is advised if the processing is delayed. Biopsy specimens should be inoculated onto Columbia blood agar plates and incubated under microaerobic conditions at 35–37 °C for 7–10 days. The growth medium can be supplemented with antimicrobials (e.g. Helicobacter pylori selective supplement/DENT, Oxoid, Basingstoke, UK) to limit overgrowth with contaminating bacteria or fungi. Following culture, the presence of H. pylori should be confirmed by a negative Gram stain and positive oxidase, urease and catalase tests. Current identification systems also include matrix-assisted laser desorption ionisation time-of-flight (Maldi-tof) technology where available. Biopsy specimens taken for culture can also be reused for DNA isolation and detection of H. pylori and resistance-associated mutations by molecular methods (see statement 6).

### How I manage H. pylori-negative, NSAID / aspirin-negative peptic ulcers [^113JBCnf]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

The first and most important action on encountering a patient with unexplained gastric or duodenal ulceration is to double check that they are truly H. pylori negative and also not taking any ulcerogenic medicines. Once the patient is confirmed to be H. pylori negative and NSAID negative, ensure that biopsies of the ulcer-whether gastric or duodenal-and of the surrounding gastric and duodenal mucosa are obtained to exclude underlying malignancy/lymphoma, Crohn's disease, and unusual infectious agents. If the etiology of the ulceration remains unexplained, an underlying gastrinoma should be considered and excluded. Patients with idiopathic ulcers should be maintained on proton pump inhibitor therapy, and higher doses may be required to control acid secretion and prevent ulcer relapse in these H. pylori-uninfected subjects.

### The second Irish Helicobacter pylori working group consensus for the diagnosis and treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection in adult patients in Ireland [^112sHfyo]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Statement 13: for those with persistent Helicobacter pylori infection following unsuccessful eradication attempts, there is no current evidence-based guideline on appropriate follow-up. The IHPWG consensus is that endoscopic surveillance with ESGE-recommended mapping biopsies for precancerous changes should be considered at an interval of 5–10 years from last failed treatment

Recommendation: strong; quality of evidence: low.

Mainly due to poor patient compliance and the increasing prevalence of antimicrobial resistance, H. pylori treatment failure has become more common leading to challenges in H. pylori management. Over decades, H. pylori gastritis may progress through a cascade of precancerous stages from intestinal metaplasia, followed by dysplasia and finally carcinoma. Evidence-based recommendations on the management of persistent H. pylori infection following multiple eradication attempts are lacking. While biomarkers for precancerous changes are under investigation, none can currently be recommended for routine clinical use. The IHPWG consensus recommends endoscopic surveillance with the European Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy/ management of epithelial precancerous conditions and lesions in the stomach mapping biopsies for precancerous changes at an interval of 5–10 years from the last failed H. pylori eradication attempt to monitor for signs of mucosal progression. In addition, the development of new symptoms at any stage during follow-up, especially any alarm symptoms, should trigger further assessment. Finally, the persistence of H. pylori infection should be considered as a relevant factor by any clinician prescribing nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or long-term PPIs.

Statement 14: as part of a quality assurance programme, Helicobacter pylori first-line, second-line and rescue therapy eradication rates should be locally monitored and audited as part of national and European registries

Recommendation: strong; quality of evidence: moderate.

There are geographical variations in the prevalence of H. pylori antimicrobial resistance and resistance is a continuously evolving process. Therefore, resistance surveillance is recommended (see statement 6). Currently, there is no national program for longterm resistance surveillance in Ireland. Monitoring the eradication success to the various treatment regimens prescribed offers an additional and more widely accessible approach to select the most appropriate H. pylori therapies in each population. The IHPWG consensus is that practitioners should perform regular audits of H. pylori treatment outcomes and that the data should be shared by means of a national registry, as well as with the Hp-EuReg, to refine the best-practice recommendations for the management of H. pylori infection in Ireland over time.

### The role of endoscopy in dyspepsia [^111gSnTR]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2015). Medium credibility.

Dyspepsia management recommendations — We recommend initial endoscopy for new-onset dyspepsia in patients 50 years of age or older or those with alarm features. We recommend that dyspeptic patients younger than 50 years of age and without alarm features undergo either an initial "test and treat" approach for H pylori or empiric therapy with a PPI, depending on the prevalence of H pylori infection in their population. For H pylori prevalence greater than 20%, "test and treat" is recommended. We suggest that dyspeptic patients who are younger than 50 years of age, lack alarm features, and are H pylori negative may be offered a trial of PPI acid suppression. We suggest that endoscopy be performed in dyspeptic patients who are H pylori negative and do not respond to empiric PPI therapy.

### ACG clinical guideline: treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection [^112Ruq3K]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Helicobacter pylori treatment — key concepts emphasize prevalence, linked testing-treatment decisions, regimen selection, and follow-up. The prevalence of H. pylori infection in North America remains substantial at 30%–40%. The determination of when to test for — and treat — H. pylori should be viewed as a single, rather than 2 separate and distinct, decisions. Clarithromycin- and levofloxacin-containing treatment regimens should be avoided in the absence of demonstrated macrolide and quinolone susceptibility, respectively. All patients who are treated for H. pylori infection should undergo a test of cure with an appropriately conducted urea breath test, fecal antigen test, or biopsy-based test at least 4 wk after completion of therapy. In treatment-experienced patients with persistent H. pylori infection that is confirmed to be clarithromycin-sensitive, PPI- or PCAB-clarithromycin triple therapy is suggested. Based on expert consensus, we advise using antibiotic susceptibility testing whenever the choice of therapy remains unclear after taking into consideration any previous treatments for H. pylori infection, past antibiotic exposure more generally, and whether there is a documented history of penicillin allergy. PCAB denotes potassium-competitive acid blocker and PPI denotes proton pump inhibitor.

Across six RCTs (n = 2,709), proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy reduced persistent symptoms versus placebo or antacid (50% vs. 73%; RR remaining dyspeptic on PPI = 0.75; 95% CI = 0.64–0.88; NNT = 6, 95% CI = 4–11). Seven RCTs (n = 2,456) comparing PPI to H2-receptor antagonist (H2RA) found no significant difference (RR = 0.93; 95% CI = 0.76–1.16; I2 = 91%).

### Insights into the evaluation and management of dyspepsia: recent developments and new guidelines [^114b7c8c]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Theoretically, therefore, the GastroPanel could be used as a noninvasive test to screen patients presenting with dyspepsia, in order to identify those who are at increased risk of gastric cancer, which in turn could be used to prioritize access to upper GI endoscopy. Those patients who test positive would undergo upper GI endoscopy to rule out gastric cancer, or else hopefully detect it at an early more treatable, or preferably even a premalignant, stage. Conversely, patients who tested negative would be presumed to have FD and be managed accordingly.

Whether such an approach is viable depends both on the performance of the test, and whether it is cost-effective. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis of 20 studies using biomarker panels for detecting H. pylori and atrophic gastritis, 19 of which used the GastroPanel, deemed the test to be reliable for the diagnosis of atrophic gastritis. The authors reported a pooled sensitivity of 74.7% (95% CI 62.0%–84.3%), and a pooled specificity of 95.6% (95% CI 92.6%–97.4%). The median prevalence of atrophic gastritis across these studies was 27%, and the negative predictive value was 91%. In other words, 91 of 100 participants with a negative test would not have atrophic gastritis. However, if a patient is taking a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) caution is advised, as PPI use increases the probability of a false negative test. As the authors acknowledged, the meta-analysis was based on studies of low methodological quality, with the potential for various sources of bias, and there remains a need for well-designed studies, with large sample sizes, to adequately evaluate the performance of the GastroPanel.

It is also unclear whether use of the GastroPanel is cost-effective in the management of dyspepsia. Although cost-effectiveness analyses of serum biomarkers have been conducted, the majority of these were in very specific populations at high risk of gastric cancer, identified for screening based on their age, rather than upper GI symptoms, – which does not help in determining whether this test has a role in the management of undiagnosed dyspepsia. Moreover, all of these studies only considered pepsinogen testing alone, rather than as part of a combined panel of biomarkers. In summary, therefore, there is currently insufficient evidence to recommend the use of combined serum biomarkers, such as GastroPanel, in the investigation of dyspepsia.

Best practice advice states that patients who have been on long-term PPI therapy (> 6 mo) should be considered for optimization and de-escalation of medical management, providers should carefully consider the risks, benefits, and alternatives of PPI use with the patient with GERD, and providers prescribing PPI therapy should be aware that adverse events from PPI in prospective data have been limited to increased risk of enteric infections; however, there is need for robust long-term data to prove or disprove any other putative adverse events.

### Common questions about the management of gastroesophageal reflux disease [^117J3xTD]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Common questions that arise regarding treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) include which medications are most effective, when surgery may be indicated, which patients should be screened for Barrett esophagus and Helicobacter pylori infection, and which adverse effects occur with these medications. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are the most effective medical therapy, and all PPIs provide similar relief of GERD symptoms. There is insufficient evidence to recommend testing for H. pylori in patients with GERD. In the absence of alarm symptoms, endoscopy is not necessary to make an initial diagnosis of GERD. Patients with alarm symptoms require endoscopy. Screening for Barrett esophagus is not routinely recommended, but may be considered in white men 50 years or older who have had GERD symptoms for at least five years. Symptom remission rates in patients with chronic GERD are similar in those who undergo surgery vs. medical management. PPI therapy has been associated with an increased risk of hip fracture, hypomagnesemia, community-acquired pneumonia, vitamin B12 deficiency, and Clostridium difficile infection.

### Sequential versus standard triple first-line therapy for Helicobacter pylori eradication [^113A1MZD]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Non-bismuth quadruple sequential therapy (SEQ) comprising a first induction phase with a dual regimen of amoxicillin and a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) for five days followed by a triple regimen phase with a PPI, clarithromycin and metronidazole for another five days, has been suggested as a new first-line treatment option to replace the standard triple therapy (STT) comprising a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), clarithromycin and amoxicillin, in which eradication proportions have declined to disappointing levels.

Objectives

To conduct a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the efficacy of a SEQ regimen with STT for the eradication of H. pylori infection, and to compare the incidence of adverse effects associated with both STT and SEQ H. pylori eradication therapies.

Search Methods

We conducted bibliographical searches in electronic databases, and handsearched abstracts from Congresses up to April 2015.

Selection Criteria

We sought randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing 10-day SEQ and STT (of at least seven days) for the eradication of H. pylori. Participants were adults and children diagnosed as positive for H. pylori infection and naïve to H. pylori treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used a pre-piloted, tabular summary to collect demographic and medical information of included study participants as well as therapeutic data and information related to the diagnosis and confirmatory tests. We evaluated the difference in intention-to-treat eradication between SEQ and STT regimens across studies, and assessed sources of the heterogeneity of this risk difference (RD) using subgroup analyses. We evaluated the quality of the evidence following Cochrane standards, and summarised it using GRADE methodology.

Main Results

We included 44 RCTs with a total of 12,284 participants (6042 in SEQ and 6242 in STT). The overall analysis showed that SEQ was significantly more effective than STT (82% vs 75% in the intention-to-treat analysis; RD 0.09, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.06 to 0.11; P < 0.001, moderate-quality evidence). Results were highly heterogeneous (I² = 75%), and 20 studies did not demonstrate differences between therapies. Reporting by geographic region (RD 0.09, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.12; studies = 44; I² = 75%, based on low-quality evidence) showed that differences between SEQ and STT were greater in Europe (RD 0.16, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.19) when compared to Asia, Africa or South America. European studies also showed a tendency towards better efficacy with SEQ; however, this tendency was reversed in 33% of the Asian studies. Africa reported the closest risk difference (RD 0.14, 95% 0.07 to 0.22) to Europe among studied regions, but confidence intervals were wider and therefore the quality of the evidence showing SEQ to be superior to STT was reduced for this region. Based on high-quality evidence, subgroup analyses showed that SEQ and STT therapies were equivalent when STT lasted for 14 days. Although, overall, the mean eradication proportion with SEQ was over 80%, we noted a tendency towards a lower average effect with this regimen in the more recent studies (2008 and after); weighted linear regression showed that the efficacies of both regimens evolved differently over the years, having a higher reduction in the efficacy of SEQ (-1.72% yearly) than in STT (-0.9% yearly). In these more recent studies (2008 and after) we were also unable to detect the superiority of SEQ over STT when STT was given for 10 days. Based on very low-quality evidence, subgroup analyses on antibiotic resistance showed that the widest difference in efficacy between SEQ and STT was in the subgroup analysis based on clarithromycin-resistant participants, in which SEQ reached a 75% average efficacy versus 43% with STT. Reporting on adverse events (AEs) (RD 0.00, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.02; participants = 8103; studies = 27; I² = 26%, based on high-quality evidence) showed no significant differences between SEQ and STT (20.4% vs 19.5%, respectively) and results were homogeneous. The quality of the studies was limited due to a lack of systematic reporting of the factors affecting risk of bias. Although randomisation was reported, its methodology (e.g. algorithms, number of blocks) was not specified in several studies. Additionally, the other 'Risk of bias' domains (such as allocation concealment of the sequence randomisation, or blinding during either performance or outcome assessment) were also unreported. However, subgroup analyses as well as sensitivity analyses or funnel plots indicated that treatment outcomes were not influenced by the quality of the included studies. On the other hand, we rated 'length of STT' and AEs for the main outcome as high-quality according to GRADE classification; but we downgraded 'publication date' quality to moderate, and 'geographic region' and 'antibiotic resistance' to low- and very low-quality, respectively.

Authors' Conclusions

Our meta-analysis indicates that prior to 2008 SEQ was more effective than STT, especially when STT was given for only seven days. Nevertheless, the apparent advantage of sequential treatment has decreased over time, and more recent studies do not show SEQ to have a higher efficacy versus STT when STT is given for 10 days. Based on the results of this meta-analysis, although SEQ offers an advantage when compared with STT, it cannot be presented as a valid alternative, given that neither SEQ nor STT regimens achieved optimal efficacy (≥ 90% eradication rate).

### The second Irish Helicobacter pylori working group consensus for the diagnosis and treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection in adult patients in Ireland [^111sPPdY]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2024). Medium credibility.

The aim of any antimicrobial therapy is to reliably cure H. pylori infection in ≥ 90% of patients. A recent network analysis of the effectiveness of multiple first-line treatments worldwide demonstrated that standard triple therapy was the least efficacious regimen analysed. An audit of first-line clarithromycin triple therapy from Tallaght University Hospital over a 3-year period (2019–2021) revealed a suboptimal eradication rate of 82.5% (N = 227/275). As first-line clarithromycin triple therapy should not be used empirically in areas where clarithromycin resistance is known to be > 15%, and local eradication rates fall below the 90% target, clarithromycin AST, either by culture or molecular methods (see statements 5 and 6) is recommended before prescribing any clarithromycin-containing therapy. Only in cases where clarithromycin susceptibility is confirmed should clarithromycin-based triple therapy (Table 3 and Fig. 1) be prescribed. The European Registry on the Management of H. pylori infection (Hp-EuReg) has demonstrated that longer treatment durations and higher dose PPI are associated with increased eradication rates in their analysis of first-line treatment outcomes in 21 533 patients over a 5-year period (2013–2018). Thus, high-dose PPI and treatment durations of 14 days are recommended. While recent studies have demonstrated the potential of the potassium-competitive acid blocker vonoprazan for acid suppression and enhancing H. pylori eradication rates, vonoprazan is currently not available in Ireland.

Summary of the current evidence

PPI therapy in both uninvestigated and functional dyspepsia (FD) is widespread. Indeed, these drugs represent a key component of all the currently employed H. pylori eradication regimens. The search for and eradication of the infection is the first line therapy in the young dyspeptic patient without alarm symptoms. In those patients with persisting symptoms despite successful eradication or naïve-uninfected patients with epigastric pain syndrome (EPS), short-term 4–8 week PPI treatment should be attempted. Finally, PPI co-therapy is indicated in patients with NSAID-associated dyspepsia, also with the aim of preventing GI events.

Dyspepsia is a common GI condition seen in clinical practice. It is not a single disease, but rather a complex of symptoms referable to the upper GI tract that often overlaps with other disease entities. In front of a patient with dyspeptic complaints, physicians should carefully evaluate the history and perform a physical examination in order to assume that symptoms arise from the upper GI tract. If the patient is young (< 45 years), and there are no alarm symptoms, endoscopy and/or functional investigations are usually not performed, the condition is labeled as "uninvestigated" dyspepsia and treatment is empiric. On the contrary, if endoscopy does reveal a structural abnormality, management of dyspepsia relies on treatment of the underlying disease (e.g. PU, reflux esophagitis, or malignancy). When endoscopy is negative (which is the case in more than 70% of patients with dyspeptic symptoms), FD could be considered and, provided Rome IV criteria are fulfilled, the final diagnosis can be confirmed.

FD is characterized by a continuous or frequently recurring epigastric pain or discomfort centered in the upper abdomen for which no organic cause can be determined. According to the most updated Rome IV classification, dyspepsia is subdivided into postprandial distress syndrome (PDS, including fullness, early satiety, nausea) and epigastric pain syndrome (EPS, including epigastric pain or epigastric burning). However, symptom overlap with either GERD or irritable bowel syndrome is not infrequent.

FD is widely prevalent in the general population − up to 15% in Italy − so that FD patients are frequently managed in clinical practice by both general practitioners and gastroenterologists. Since the etiology of FD remains unclear and is probably heterogeneous, no definite single treatment is currently available for these patients. Indeed, different therapeutic approaches have been proposed.

### AGA clinical practice update on the management of refractory Helicobacter pylori infection: expert review [^115g3bHz]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Definition of refractory Helicobacter pylori infection — refractory H pylori infection is defined by a persistently positive nonserologic H pylori test result (ie, a breath, stool, or gastroscopy-based test), at least 4 weeks after 1 or more completed course(s) of a current guideline-recommended first-line H pylori eradication therapy, and off of any medications, such as proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs), that might impact the test sensitivity. Refractory H pylori infection should be differentiated from recurrent infection — that is, a nonserologic test that was initially negative after eradication therapy, but then subsequently positive at a later interval — because the latter might be the result of ongoing intrafamilial exposure and may be best addressed by testing household members and treating those who test positive.

Treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection is becoming increasingly challenging due largely to the rising rates of antimicrobial resistance and to the relative complexity of treatment regimens. If a reliable test to assess the antimicrobial sensitivity/resistance of H. pylori was readily available, treatment would be more focused and-presumably-more effective. However, antimicrobial sensitivity testing is difficult to obtain in most parts of the United States. Therefore, physicians have to rely on clinical judgment in selecting treatment regimens for their infected patients. The aims of this review are to summarize recent treatment recommendations and to examine available evidence for how we might improve on our current treatment selections. Information on this review is directed primarily toward physicians practicing in the United States.

Comment

As is apparent from statement 8, there is a group of patients with FD for whom H. pylori is considered the cause of their symptoms, and this can be established if eradication is associated with sustained symptom benefit. This scenario is the only one where patients with chronic dyspeptic symptoms and a negative endoscopy can be 'cured', albeit with some delay after successful eradication therapy. Moreover, very few effective alternative therapeutic approaches have been proved to have substantial and sustained benefit in FD. Finally, eradication therapy is a short treatment, with acceptable cost–benefit for controlling dyspeptic symptoms, and with other potential benefits for prevention of peptic ulcer and gastric cancer. Based on these considerations, eradication therapy can be proposed as first-line treatment for H. pylori -infected dyspeptic patients, which is in line with a recent management algorithm by the Rome foundation.

CQ10. How effective is H. pylori eradication on dyspeptic symptoms — in the short and long term — and how does it compare with other treatments (such as proton pump inhibitors (PPIs))?

Statement 10

In H. pylori -infected dyspeptic patients, eradication therapy for dyspeptic symptoms is better than placebo and is the preferred option.

Grade of recommendation: strong

Evidence level: high

Consensus level: 97.4%

Comment

Eradication therapy studies have confirmed that a subset of H. pylori -infected patients with FD is relieved of dyspeptic symptoms by eradication therapy. To date, only a limited number of studies have directly compared eradication therapy with other treatments that are used for FD, such as PPIs or prokinetic therapy. Hence, although the symptomatic gain takes at least 6 months, eradication is the preferred treatment. Future trials should compare eradication with treatment modalities other than placebo in H pylori -infected patients with chronic dyspeptic symptoms and a negative endoscopy.

CQ11. Should patients who remain dyspeptic after successful H. pylori eradication be considered to have FD?

Statement 11

Patients who remain symptomatic after successful H. pylori eradication should be considered to have FD.

Grade of recommendation: weak

Evidence level: moderate

Consensus level: 97.4%

### AGA clinical practice update on the management of refractory Helicobacter pylori infection: expert review [^112fSwVk]. Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

The primary objectives of this Clinical Practice Update (CPU) Expert Review are to 1) provide a salient overview of determinants of H. pylori eradication treatment failure, including host-, microbe-, and systems-related factors as they are currently understood; and, 2) leverage these data to provide clinical practitioners with evidence- and consensus-based multimodal best practice advice for treating H. pylori after the first treatment failure. We include a clinically relevant synthesis of contemporary data on the appropriateness and efficacy, or lack thereof, of specific antimicrobial treatment regimens and adjunctive therapeutic agents for this purpose. The terms "salvage" and "rescue" therapy are commonly used in the literature to describe treatment courses following the initial eradication therapy, but without a consistent definition. As such, we avoid the use of these terms. Additionally, to the extent possible, we focus on evidence from North America in order to ensure that this article is most relevant for US practitioners.

Definition of refractory infection

For the purpose of this CPU Expert Review, refractory H. pylori infection is defined by a persistently positive non-serological H. pylori test (i.e. a breath-, stool-, or gastroscopy-based test), at least 4 weeks following one or more completed course(s) of current guideline-recommended first-line H. pylori eradication therapy, and off of any medications that might impact the test sensitivity (e.g. proton-pump inhibitors (PPI)). Refractory H. pylori infection should be differentiated from recurrent infection — that is, a non-serological test which was initially negative after eradication therapy, but then subsequently positive at a later interval — as the latter might be the result of ongoing intrafamilial exposure and may be best addressed by testing household members and treating those who test positive.

Statement 6: Eradication of H. pylori is recommended in patients commencing long-term PPI therapy.

Recommendation grade: A; Evidence level: 1c; Agreement level: 95%

PPI maintenance therapy for 6 months or longer is recommended in certain diseases, such as gastroesophageal reflux disease and Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. Development of gastric pre-malignant lesions in H. pylori -infected, long-term PPI users is not universally accepted. A meta-analysis of 7 randomized controlled trials (RCTs; 1789 pts), with a high or unclear risk of bias, revealed no clear evidence of corpus gastric atrophy or intestinal metaplasia (IM) progression in long-term (> 6 months) PPI users. Although studies in H. pylori -infected Mongolian gerbils showed that PPI treatment accelerated the progression to gastric cancer, this has not been confirmed in humans. A meta-analysis of 12 studies (2658 pts) revealed that the eradication of H. pylori resulted in a significant improvement in atrophy in the corpus, irrespective of the continuation of acid-suppressive drugs, but no regression of IM. In a systematic review of a total of 16 studies (1920 pts), H. pylori -positive patients receiving long-term (> 3 years) PPI therapy were exposed to a higher risk of developing enterochromaffin-like cell linear/micronodular hyperplasia and corpus atrophy, compared to H. pylori -negative patients. No evidence of neoplastic changes was found. H. pylori eradication in infected long-term PPI users is an economically dominant strategy, significantly reducing symptom severity and overall healthcare costs.

Background information and observation items

Background information

The background characteristics of participants that will be collected include date of birth, gender, height, weight, medical history, complications, smoking history, and drinking history. The date and the results of the most recent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy including the degree of reflux esophagitis, presence or absence of esophageal hiatal hernia, and gastric mucosal atrophy, will be obtained from the patient's chart. H. pylori infection status (uninvestigated, uninfected, after eradication), serum gastrin level, kinds of PPI and the duration of oral PPI administration, will be obtained from the patient's chart. Information on concomitant medications will be obtained from the patient's chart. Participants will be asked to fill out the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale questionnaire.

Rescue treatment

Patients are instructed that if the patient develops heartburn or regurgitation that bothers him/her, the patient can take the rescue treatment, which was the dose of PPI that the patient was taking before the start of this study. Each patient is given a structured diary and is asked to record daily how much PPI, if any, the patient took each day. At the 4-week, 6-month and 12-month visits, the doctor will review the patient's diary and confirm with the patient how many days the patient took the rescue treatment during the 28-day period prior to that visit.

Symptom questionnaire

Participants will be asked to fill out the Symptom questionnaire of the Global Overall Symptom (GOS) scale and the Frequency Scale for the Symptoms of GERD (FSSG) at the start of the study and at 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months after the start of the study. The GOS scale is a 7-point scale as follows: 1, No problems; 2, Minimal problems; 3, Mild problems; 4, Moderate problems; 5, Moderately severe problems; 6. Severe problems; 7, Very severe problems. Participants are asked to grade the overall severity of the following eight symptoms: stomach pain, heartburn, regurgitation, postprandial fullness, nausea, belching, early satiety, and bloating. The FSSG consists of 12 items: seven items are related to reflux symptoms, while five items are related to dyspeptic symptoms. The scores are calculated according to the frequency of the symptoms as follows: 0, never; 1, occasionally; 2, sometimes; 3, often; and 4, always.

### Controversies regarding management of Helicobacter pylori infections [^116Uh3CM]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The recognition that Helicobacter pylori should be considered and treated as an infectious disease has yet to fundamentally change diagnostic and treatment practices and has resulted in many controversies.

Recent Findings

We discuss the following controversies: whether the current 'per-patient' approach to H. pylori testing based on symptoms should be expanded to include achieving population-level H. pylori eradication, whether H. pylori should be approached as an infectious gastrointestinal disease similar to that of other infectious diseases of similar severity and outcome, whether treatment of H. pylori should be primarily empiric or based on antibiotic susceptibility and locally proven successful therapies as are other infectious diseases, whether it is necessary to obtain confirmation of treatment success in every patient treated for H. pylori, and whether potassium-competitive acid blockers should replace proton pump inhibitors in H. pylori therapy.

Summary

Available guidelines and meta-analyses do not yet address H. pylori as an infectious disease. The diagnosis and management and treatment success of H. pylori infections trails behind that of other important infectious diseases. We provide new insights and propose changes in the traditional understanding required to modernize the management of H. pylori infections.

### American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy guideline on the diagnosis and management of GERD: methodology and review of evidence [^113x8Hi9]. VideoGIE (2025). Medium credibility.

Certainty of the evidence

Overall quality of evidence was very low when considering all of the outcomes together. This was due to either one or combinations of the following: risk of bias, imprecision (low sample size, varying CIs), indirectness, and inability to pool the data because of varying outcome definitions.

Discussion

Overall, the certainty in evidence was very low. The panel acknowledged that while there is lack of robust data, there is benefit of weight loss and smoking cessation from overall health improvement and cancer reduction. Data regarding other dietary interventions may be weak but these are low-risk interventions that can be incorporated as GERD-related lifestyle measures. Given the low cost to these interventions as well as the potential for other health benefits of these lifestyle interventions, the panel agreed that these lifestyle modifications should be recommended to decrease GERD symptoms based on the evidence available.

Question 4: In patients with GERD, does proton pump inhibitor compared with placebo reduce symptoms?

Recommendation 4:
- In patients with symptomatic and confirmed GERD with predominant heartburn symptoms, the ASGE recommends medical management with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) at the lowest possible dose for the shortest possible period of time while initiating discussion about long-term management options. (Strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence)
- In patients with suboptimal clinical response to PPI therapy, the ASGE suggests testing CYP2C19 polymorphism and adjusting PPI dosage and selection accordingly. (Conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence)

Best practice advice:

- Patients who have been on long-term PPI therapy (> 6 months) should be considered for optimization and de-escalation of medical management.
- Providers should carefully consider the risks, benefits, and alternatives of PPI use for patients with GERD.
- Providers prescribing PPI therapy should be aware that adverse events from PPI in prospective data have been limited to a modest increased risk of enteric infections; however, there is a need for robust long-term data to prove or disprove any other putative adverse events.

### Management of the dyspeptic patient: anything goes? [^114Mk8tQ]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

Guidelines on the initial management of dyspeptic patients are remarkably conflicting or ambiguous and recommend a variety of initial approaches and no single strategy has been successfully implemented in primary care. In this issue of the American Journal of Gastroenterology, Jarbol and colleagues report the results of a large Danish trial comparing a test-and-treat strategy, an empiric PPI strategy, and a combined strategy with Helicobacter testing if symptoms improved after the PPI. Patient-related outcomes at 1 yr did not differ, but the use of endoscopy was highest in the PPI strategy. From the patient's perspective it seems that anything goes as long as the clinician sticks to a well-defined and proven strategy. Helicobacter pylori testing is still recommendable owing to the long-term benefits, but the rapidly decreasing Helicobacter prevalence will soon make the test-and-treat strategy cost-ineffective as the initial step.

### Helicobacter pylori diagnosis and management [^112MmZKR]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

H pylori is a global human pathogen and is the major cause of gastritis and the gastritis-associated diseases: gastric ulcer, duodenal ulcer, gastric cancer, and primary gastric B-cell lymphoma (MALToma). Although several reliable diagnostic tests are widely available, the ideal regimen for treating the infection re-mains to be established. The current first-line or legacy triple therapy regimens fail in 20% to 40% of patients. Causes of treatment failure include antibiotic resistance, poor compliance, short (7–10 days) duration of therapy, and drug-related side effects. Fourteen-day triple therapy has an approximately 12% better cure rate than does 7-day therapy; therefore, shorter durations can no longer be recommended. Recent studies confirmed older observations that the success rate of legacy triple regimens (PPI plus two antibiotics) can be improved if the duration is extended to 14 days or if a third antibiotic is given. Sequential therapy (PPI plus amoxicillin followed by a PPI plus clarithromycin plus metronidazole) requires further evaluation although the concept appears very promising and therapy should probably replace the legacy triple therapies. More studies are needed to examine doses, durations, and the need for sequential administration of the drugs, which extends the duration to 14 days. Nonetheless, sequential quadruple therapy probably should replace the legacy triple therapies. Classic quadruple therapy contains bismuth, a PPI, 1500 mg of metronidazole, and 1500 mg of tetracycline. It provides the highest average eradication rates and in many regions should be considered as the initial approach. Confirmation of eradication using noninvasive diagnostic tests, such as a urea breath test or stool antigen assay, is now the standard of care. The diagnosis of latent or symptomatic H pylori like the diagnosis of latent or symptomatic syphilis, always should prompt treatment. Because of decreasing cure rates, new and improved therapies are needed.

### Peptic ulcer disease and H. pylori infection: common questions and answers [^112REd7m]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Peptic ulcer disease is common, affecting 1 out of 12 people in the United States. Approximately 1 in 5 peptic ulcers is associated with Helicobacter pylori infection, with most of the rest due to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use. The combination of H. pylori infection and NSAID use synergistically increases the risk of bleeding ulcers more than sixfold. The H. pylori test-and-treat strategy is the mainstay of outpatient management. Patients younger than 60 years who have dyspepsia without alarm symptoms should be tested and, if positive, treated to eradicate the infection. If negative, they should be treated empirically with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). Esophagogastroduodenoscopy is recommended for patients 60 years and older with new symptoms and for anyone with alarm symptoms. Noninvasive testing for H. pylori using a urea breath test or stool antigen test is preferred. Bismuth quadruple therapy or concomitant therapy (nonbismuth quadruple therapy) is the preferred first-line treatment for eradication because of increasing clarithromycin resistance. To lower the risk of ulcers associated with long-term NSAID use, clinicians should consider coadministering a PPI or substituting an NSAID with less effect on gastric mucosa, such as celecoxib. Eradicating H. pylori in NSAID users reduces the likelihood of peptic ulcers by one-half. Potential risks of long-term PPI use include fractures, interaction with antiplatelet medications, chronic kidney disease, Clostridioides difficile infection, dementia, and magnesium, calcium, and vitamin B12 micronutrient deficiencies.

### Is empiric proton pump inhibition in patients with symptoms of extraesophageal gastroesophageal reflux justified? [^112r4kzA]. BMC Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

In addition to the imprecision of a PPI trial as a diagnostic test, the potential side effects of PPIs should also be kept in mind. While the absolute risk of side effects caused by a PPI trial is low, long-term use in larger populations may significantly increase gastrointestinal infections, alter the gastrointestinal microbiome and increase the risk of gastric cancer. Rebound acid hypersecretion after cessation of PPI use is especially of concern when treating individuals with poor indication of PPI use as it may lead to long-term use with risks that will necessarily outweigh benefits. Symptomatic rebound hypersecretion is likely to be common after a 12-week PPI trial. After eight weeks of esomeprazole 40 mg once daily 44% of healthy volunteers reported symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux versus 15% in the placebo group. Similarly, after cessation of four weeks of pantoprazole 40 mg once daily as many as 44% versus 9% in the placebo group had dyspeptic symptoms. After long-term PPI use, rebound acid hypersecretion lasts between two and four months, which may prevent patients from stopping PPI once started. The use of PPI has almost doubled over the past decade in Norway as well as in other countries and the costs are high. Although many patients have good indications for long-term PPI use that clearly outweighs risks of side effects, the concern is obvious when patients without indication or benefit of PPI use starts life-long acid inhibition.

### AGA clinical practice update on the management of refractory Helicobacter pylori infection: expert review [^114HuxWv]. Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection is recognized as one of the most common chronic bacterial infections worldwide, infecting approximately half of the global population. H. pylori is a World Health Organization (WHO)-designated carcinogen and the strongest known risk factor for noncardia gastric adenocarcinoma, the most prevalent form of gastric cancer. It is also causally linked to peptic ulcer disease. Even though only 1–3% of infected individuals will develop malignant complications, H. pylori accounts for 15% of the total cancer burden globally, with up to 89% of all gastric cancer attributable to H. pylori infection. Accordingly, all major gastroenterological societies recommend that H. pylori be eradicated in individuals who test positive.

Downstream consequences of failed treatment include clinical complications related to persistent H. pylori infection and repeated exposure to antibiotics and high-dose acid suppression, generation of antibiotic resistance in H. pylori and other organisms, as well as the associated direct and indirect costs to the healthcare system. Because the likelihood of successful eradication decreases with each subsequent therapeutic attempt, every effort should be made to address factors that might contribute to eradication failure.

Several guidelines exist to help providers choose regimens to eradicate H. pylori on the first attempt; they also include advice on management after initial treatments fail. However, these guidelines are backed by limited high-quality evidence. In general, they rely heavily on trials conducted in populations that are relatively homogenous within geographic borders, albeit ethnically distinct (e.g. Asian-Pacific populations). In contrast, the United States (US) population comprises individuals with diverse ancestral backgrounds, with correspondingly diverse H. pylori strains. In the US, the lack of recent comparative clinical trials is coupled with limited knowledge of locoregional H. pylori antibiotic resistance patterns and of regimen-specific local cure rates, as well as limited contemporary data on temporal trends and relevant demographic details (e.g. age, race and ethnicity). Current national and international guidelines provide limited guidance on how to approach factors other than H. pylori antibiotic resistance which might also underlie eradication failure, such as host- and systems-related factors. Collectively, these issues contribute to persistent H. pylori infection (Figure 1).

Future research priorities — Helicobacter pylori infection (North America): In preparing this CPG, the authors identified key knowledge gaps in the management of patients diagnosed with H. pylori infection or at risk for harboring H. pylori infection in North America, specifically, and these should be acknowledged as research priorities. Priorities include identifying which individuals in North America are most likely to benefit from opportunistic H. pylori testing (and subsequent treatment if positive) to prevent gastric cancer; conducting additional high-quality studies in North America that compare the effectiveness and tolerability of the newly approved and recommended therapies against older regimens; assessing whether replacing a PPI (proton pump inhibitor) with a PCAB in BQT or rifabutin triple therapy further improves efficacy and tolerability and optimizing PCAB antimicrobial dual therapy in North American populations to achieve consistently high eradication rates; addressing pharmacogenomic heterogeneity where the prevalence of CYP2C19 polymorphisms varies according to ancestry, including a higher prevalence of CYP2C19 poor metabolizers in people of Asian ancestry, and studying whether CYP2C19 testing or selection of non-CYP2C19 metabolized PPI or a PCAB should be considered and whether these options are cost-effective; leveraging antibiotic susceptibility testing as an individualized, precision approach, noting that key evaluations have not yet been evaluated in studies from North America and that this is an immediate research priority; and developing a national registry to track H. pylori antibiotic resistance rates and local eradication success rates with specific treatment regimens to support evidence-based treatment choices.

Helicobacter pylori — post-treatment testing for cure — All patients treated for H. pylori infection should undergo a test of cure using an appropriately conducted urea breath test, fecal antigen test, or biopsy-based test at least 4 weeks after therapy, and the nonendoscopic urea breath test and fecal antigen test are highly accurate for confirming treatment success when performed at least 4 weeks after completion; because proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) can cause false-negative results, they should be stopped for 2 weeks before testing, standard doses of H2RAs or antacids do not affect accuracy, and patients should avoid bismuth and antibiotics for at least 4 weeks before a test of cure; serological testing should not be used to assess post-treatment status, and while a positive biopsy urease test may confirm ongoing infection, a negative result without corroboration should not be considered definitive proof of eradication; in the United States, recurrence after successful eradication occurs at 1% (95% CI 0.3%–3%) per year, and routine testing for cure also enables providers to monitor local results and change regimens if outcomes are suboptimal (e.g., if under 85%).

### Joint ESPGHAN / NASPGHAN guidelines for the management of Helicobacter pylori in children and adolescents (update 2016) [^115EKsz9]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2017). Medium credibility.

Table 6 — key changes in pediatric H pylori recommendations: Testing for H pylori during endoscopy should only be performed if intending to treat, and testing for H pylori is not recommended in the initial investigation of iron deficiency anemia. The guideline includes a weak recommendation to consider noninvasive testing for H pylori infection in the setting of chronic ITP and recommends against testing in the setting of short stature, with removal of recommendation for testing in the setting of family history of gastric cancer or MALT, as rarely encountered. For diagnosis, six gastric biopsies for either (a) histopathology (H pylori–positive gastritis) plus at least 1 other positive biopsy–based test or (b) positive culture. For treatment candidacy, if H pylori is an incidental finding at endoscopy treatment may be considered following careful discussion of the risks and benefits of H pylori treatment with the patient/parents, with a weak recommendation for patient with chronic ITP. For therapy parameters, duration of therapy 14 days, use a higher dose of PPI, particularly in younger children, with doses from 1.5 to 2.5 mg/ kg bodyweight and day, and include a recommendation that physician explain to the patient/ family the importance of adherence. Abbreviations: ITP (immune thrombocytopenic purpura), MALT (mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue), PPI (proton pump inhibitor).

### ACG clinical guideline: treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection [^116v4nbG]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Indications for Helicobacter pylori testing and treatment — test-and-treat strategy and follow-up are outlined. Testing for, and treatment of, H. pylori infection should be viewed as dependent rather than independent actions, and therefore all patients with an indication for testing should be offered effective treatment if confirmed to have active infection — and should subsequently undergo a test-of-cure after treatment. The "test-and-treat" approach for uninvestigated dyspepsia is reasonable in patients under the age of 60 years, without alarm features and without other indications for endoscopy. In patients with functional dyspepsia, eradication of H. pylori infection only provides modest benefit.

### Proton pump inhibitors and gastric neoplasia [^111fnuCW]. Gut (2006). Low credibility.

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are very effective in maintaining symptomatic and endoscopic remission of acid peptic disorders, such as gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. Side effects with respect to function and morphology of the gastric mucosa are common. Helicobacter pylori eradication can partially prevent and reverse these effects without impairing PPI therapy for gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. This makes long term PPI treatment a safe therapy for patients with acid peptic disorders. The potential side effects of such therapy are discussed here.
