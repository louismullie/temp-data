## Question

What is the recommended management of preseptal cellulitis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the recommended management of preseptal cellulitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to distinguish preseptal from orbital cellulitis accurately. Then, I should determine the appropriate setting of care using severity and reliability criteria. Next, I will select empiric antibiotics, decide when to add MRSA coverage, and address special populations. After that, I should set duration, monitoring, and escalation thresholds. Finally, I will outline diagnostics, prevention of recurrence, and summarize a practical algorithm anchored in guidelines and evidence [^111ek3cL] [^111gsSaf] [^112RXUEh].

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic distinction because management hinges on it. Preseptal cellulitis is anterior to the orbital septum, whereas orbital cellulitis is post-septal and marked by proptosis, ophthalmoplegia or pain with eye movements, diplopia, reduced visual acuity, and chemosis; if any orbital signs are present, I need urgent contrast-enhanced imaging and to manage as orbital cellulitis rather than preseptal cellulitis, preferably with CT initially and MRI if CT is equivocal [^117G5M13] [^111cvkGX].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions before I check severity and systemic involvement. I should assess for SIRS, fever, hemodynamic instability, altered mental status, and immunocompromise; these features lower the threshold for hospitalization, while reliable, systemically well patients without concerning features can usually be managed as outpatients, consistent with IDSA guidance on outpatient care for cellulitis without SIRS or instability [^111ek3cL] [^112iZpuV].

> I will now examine predisposing factors because they influence both etiology and management. Dacryocystitis, trauma or recent procedures, sinusitis or URI, and hordeolum are common drivers, with adult series showing dacryocystitis and hordeolum predominance; cosmetic procedures like microblading can rarely precipitate infection, so I should ask about recent aesthetic interventions and local exposures [^115CqUCM] [^11158rQn] [^11418xQv].

> Next, I should review the setting of care for pediatrics specifically. Wait, I should verify whether ambulatory IV therapy is acceptable in children with moderate disease but without systemic toxicity; data suggest home IV ceftriaxone via hospital-in-the-home programs can be safe and cost-effective for selected older children, while younger children or those with systemic symptoms generally merit admission for IV therapy and close monitoring [^1164f7aQ] [^117KqU2Z].

> Let me think about first-line outpatient antibiotics for nonpurulent disease without MRSA risk factors. For adults, cephalexin 500 mg every 6 hours or amoxicillin-clavulanate 1 g every 8 hours target streptococci and MSSA; I need to ensure duration aligns with best-practice advice — 5 to 6 days typically suffices, extending to 7 to 10 days if slow to improve, consistent with ACP short-course guidance and IDSA minimum 5 days recommendations [^112RXUEh] [^111gsSaf] [^116PoWQe].

> But wait, what if MRSA risk is present or the cellulitis is purulent or fails β-lactam therapy? I should add MRSA-active therapy such as TMP-SMX, doxycycline or minocycline, or clindamycin; if I choose TMP-SMX or a tetracycline, I need to add a β-lactam like amoxicillin for streptococcal coverage because these agents have variable streptococcal activity, aligning with IDSA MRSA guidance and global SSTI pathways [^1166kUD4] [^115M76PW] [^114zdKRg] [^112RXUEh].

> I should confirm the approach in β-lactam allergy. Clindamycin 300 to 450 mg every 8 hours is a reasonable single agent offering both MRSA and streptococcal coverage in outpatients when β-lactams are contraindicated, though I need to remain mindful of local resistance patterns and C. difficile risk per MRSA guideline considerations [^1166kUD4].

> Now, for inpatient regimens, I need to check standard IV options and escalation rules. For typical nonpurulent cases requiring IV therapy, cefazolin 2 g every 8 hours or an amoxicillin-clavulanate IV equivalent can be used; if MRSA risk is high or clinical severity warrants, add vancomycin or consider linezolid, reserving vancomycin plus piperacillin-tazobactam or a carbapenem for severe infection or immunocompromise according to IDSA and international pathways [^112RXUEh] [^113PjKu3] [^114LP8SG].

> Let me verify pediatric IV choices and dosing nuances. First-line antistaphylococcal agents like cefazolin or oxacillin are appropriate, with vancomycin added when MRSA risk is present; in children under 12 years who require it, linezolid can be dosed at 10 mg/kg every 8 hours, which I should reserve for specific indications given stewardship considerations in the pediatric MRSA guidance [^111hF6M3] [^1116N4gR].

> I need to ensure duration and response assessment are evidence-based. A minimum of 5 days is generally adequate if improving, but I should reassess at 48 to 72 hours; early nonresponse at day 1 does not mandate an immediate antibiotic switch since the natural inflammatory trajectory can lag, whereas nonresponse by day 3 predicts a more complicated course and may justify escalation, as suggested by prospective cellulitis response studies and guideline duration recommendations [^115fP7Gu] [^115ZLcDr] [^116PoWQe].

> Hold on, I should verify clear escalation triggers to avoid missing orbital spread. Worsening swelling or pain, new proptosis, pain with eye movements, diplopia, visual changes, or persistent fever beyond 72 hours should prompt emergent orbital imaging and ophthalmology/ENT consultation to evaluate for orbital cellulitis or abscess, consistent with imaging literature and clinical pathways [^117G5M13] [^112RXUEh].

> Next, I should review diagnostics pragmatically. Routine cultures are low yield in uncomplicated nonpurulent cellulitis, but I should obtain wound cultures if drainage is present, culture any abscess at drainage, consider blood cultures if febrile and systemically ill, and obtain CT imaging for suspected orbital signs, lack of improvement by 48 to 72 hours, severe trauma, or concern for abscess or osteomyelitis; CRP trends can support severity assessment, with higher CRP associated with orbital involvement in pediatric cohorts [^112RXUEh] [^117G5M13] [^113KXkHu].

> I will now examine immunocompromised states and atypical etiologies because I need to broaden differentials and empiric coverage accordingly. In severe immunocompromise or febrile neutropenia, broader Gram-negative and antipseudomonal coverage with vancomycin plus an antipseudomonal β-lactam is advised, and nonbacterial mimics or fungal etiologies must be considered per IDSA guidance for SSTIs in special hosts [^113PjKu3] [^115RUDYD] [^115uKspM].

> But wait, I almost overlooked recurrence prevention, which is crucial once the acute episode is controlled. I should identify and treat predisposing factors such as edema, eczema, tinea pedis, venous insufficiency, and toe-web abnormalities; if patients have three to four episodes per year despite risk-factor management, consider prophylactic penicillin V or erythromycin for weeks to months, or intramuscular benzathine penicillin every 2 to 4 weeks, and continue prophylaxis as long as predisposing factors persist, with consideration of MRSA decolonization in selected households [^117MYykE] [^115ssoEa] [^116NB7ww] [^111J8tTJ].

> Let me reconsider a common pitfall: I initially thought broader-spectrum IV therapy might be prudent for many preseptal cases, but hold on, that risks overtreatment; the predominance of streptococcal etiologies in nonpurulent cellulitis supports narrow-spectrum, short-course therapy in reliable outpatients, with timely reassessment to avoid unnecessary escalation and to align with stewardship principles highlighted by ACP and SSTI response studies [^111gsSaf] [^116zpUYf] [^115fP7Gu].

> To synthesize an actionable algorithm, I should confirm preseptal versus orbital features, assess severity and host factors, choose outpatient versus inpatient setting, start targeted antibiotics (cephalexin or amoxicillin-clavulanate for nonpurulent disease, add MRSA coverage when indicated), treat for at least 5 days with reassessment at 48 to 72 hours, address predisposing factors, escalate with imaging and specialty input if orbital signs emerge or if no improvement by day 3, and consider prophylaxis for recurrent disease, consistent with IDSA and ACP recommendations [^111ek3cL] [^116PoWQe] [^111gsSaf].

Treat preseptal cellulitis with **empiric oral antibiotics** (amoxicillin-clavulanate or cephalexin) for 5–7 days in mild cases when the patient is reliable, with reassessment within 24–48 hours [^111gsSaf] [^116PoWQe] [^112RXUEh]. Add **MRSA coverage** (clindamycin, doxycycline, or TMP-SMX) when risk factors are present or disease is severe [^114ZhUEW] [^1166kUD4]. Hospitalize for **IV antibiotics** when systemic symptoms, immunocompromise, or concern for orbital involvement are present [^112iZpuV] [^111ek3cL]. Obtain imaging only if orbital cellulitis is suspected or if there is no improvement within 24–48 hours [^117G5M13] [^114cZogF]. Address underlying causes and monitor for progression to orbital cellulitis [^115ofQds] [^117MYykE].

---

## Clinical assessment and diagnosis

- **Clinical features**: Eyelid erythema, edema, warmth, and tenderness without proptosis, ophthalmoplegia, or visual impairment [^117G5M13] [^117Sz9yf].

- **Differential diagnosis**: Orbital cellulitis, allergic reactions, insect bites, herpes zoster ophthalmicus, and other inflammatory conditions [^117Sz9yf].

- **Imaging**: Not routinely required; obtain contrast-enhanced CT or MRI if orbital cellulitis is suspected or if there is no improvement within 24–48 hours [^117G5M13] [^114cZogF].

---

## Indications for hospitalization

Hospitalization is indicated for **any of the following**:

- **Systemic symptoms**: Fever, malaise, or signs of systemic infection [^112iZpuV].

- **Immunocompromised patients**: Severe immunocompromise or comorbidities [^112iZpuV].

- **Failure of outpatient therapy**: No improvement within 24–48 hours.

- **Concern for orbital involvement**: Proptosis, ophthalmoplegia, or visual impairment [^117G5M13].

- **Poor adherence**: Inability to adhere to outpatient therapy or lack of reliable follow-up [^112iZpuV].

---

## Empiric antibiotic therapy

Empiric antibiotic therapy should cover common pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus (including **MRSA**) and Streptococcus species [^116aZEV3] [^115CqUCM].

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended antibiotics** |
|-|-|
| Mild, outpatient | - Amoxicillin-clavulanate <br/> - Cephalexin <br/> - Clindamycin (if β-lactam allergy) [^111gsSaf] [^111ek3cL] |
| MRSA risk factors | - Clindamycin <br/> - Doxycycline <br/> - TMP-SMX [^114ZhUEW] [^1166kUD4] |
| Severe, inpatient | - IV cefazolin <br/> - IV ampicillin-sulbactam <br/> - IV vancomycin (if MRSA suspected) [^112iZpuV] [^114LP8SG] [^113PjKu3] |

---

## Duration of antibiotic therapy

For the duration of antibiotic therapy, **Outpatient therapy** is typically 5–7 days and may be extended if there is no improvement within 48 hours [^111gsSaf]. Inpatient therapy lasts **7–10 days**, with transition to oral antibiotics once clinical improvement is observed [^114LP8SG].

---

## Adjunctive therapies

Adjunctive therapies include **warm compresses** applied to the affected area to reduce discomfort and swelling, and **analgesics** such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen for pain and fever control. Underlying conditions such as sinusitis, dacryocystitis, or skin lesions should be identified and treated [^117Sz9yf] [^115ofQds].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Monitoring and follow-up should include **reassessment within 24–48 hours** to confirm improvement and surveillance for signs of progression — such as proptosis, ophthalmoplegia, or visual impairment. Patient education should emphasize adherence to antibiotics and keeping scheduled follow-up appointments [^116zpUYf] [^117G5M13].

---

## Prevention of recurrence

Prevention of recurrence focuses on **identifying and treating predisposing factors** — such as sinusitis, skin lesions, or chronic edema — and reinforcing hygiene practices, including regular handwashing and wound care. Prophylactic antibiotics may be considered in recurrent cases with persistent risk factors [^117MYykE] [^115ssoEa] [^1139Z69g] [^111e2hiG].

---

## Potential complications

- **Orbital cellulitis**: Infection spread posterior to the orbital septum [^117G5M13].

- **Abscess formation**: Preseptal or orbital abscess [^117G5M13].

- **Vision loss**: Rare but serious complication [^117G5M13].

- **Cavernous sinus thrombosis**: Rare but life-threatening [^111x6z8K].

---

Preseptal cellulitis is managed with empiric antibiotics, close monitoring, and treatment of underlying conditions. Hospitalization and imaging are **reserved for severe cases or suspected orbital involvement** [^112iZpuV] [^117G5M13].

### Empiric outpatient therapy with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, cephalexin, or clindamycin for cellulitis [^114ha5U7]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Limited data exist on optimal empiric oral antibiotic treatment for outpatients with cellulitis in areas with a high prevalence of community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections.

- **Methods**: We conducted a 3-year retrospective cohort study of outpatients with cellulitis empirically treated at a teaching clinic of a tertiary-care medical center in Hawaii. Patients who received more than one oral antibiotic, were hospitalized, or had no follow-up information were excluded. Treatment success rates for empiric therapy were compared among commonly prescribed antibiotics in our clinic: cephalexin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and clindamycin. Risk factors for treatment failure were evaluated using multivariate logistic regression analysis.

- **Results**: Of 544 patients with cellulitis, 405 met the inclusion criteria. The overall treatment success rate of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was significantly higher than the rate of cephalexin (91% vs. 74%; p < 0.001). Clindamycin success rates were higher than those of cephalexin in patients who had subsequently culture-confirmed MRSA infections (P = .01), had moderately severe cellulitis (P = .03), and were obese (P = .04). Methicillin-resistant S. aureus was recovered in 72 of 117 positive culture specimens (62%). Compliance and adverse drug reaction rates were not significantly different among patients who received these three antibiotics. Factors associated with treatment failure included therapy with an antibiotic that was not active against community-associated MRSA (adjusted odds ratio 4.22; 95% confidence interval).

### Differences in characteristics, aetiologies, isolated pathogens, and the efficacy of antibiotics in adult patients with preseptal cellulitis and orbital cellulitis between 2000–2009 and 2010–2019 [^115CqUCM]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2023). High credibility.

The study aims to understand whether the epidemiology, aetiologies, common pathogens, and the antibiotic efficacy against the identified bacteria of periorbital cellulitis in adults have changed recently (2010–2019) compared with the past decade (2000–2009).

- **Methods**: Adult patients (n = 224) diagnosed with preseptal cellulitis and orbital cellulitis admitted to Kaohsiung Veterans General Hospital during 2000–2019 were retrospectively reviewed. Demographic and clinical characteristics, isolated pathogens, and antibiotic susceptibility tests against the commonly cultured bacteria were analyzed.

- **Results**: Preseptal cellulitis showed a tendency of female predominance. Patients in their 60s showed an incidence peak; more cases were observed during winter. The most common predisposing factor was dacryocystitis (15.5%-30.5%), followed by hordeolum (15.5%-24.8%). The aetiology of sinusitis (p = 0.001) decreased, and that of conjunctivitis (p = 0.007) increased significantly with time. Culture results of nasopharyngeal swabs and local abscess showed a higher positivity rate than conjunctival swab. The most common isolates were methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Antibiotics including fluoroquinolones and vancomycin were effective; in contrast, ampicillin/sulbactam and oxacillin showed decreasing efficacy against gram-positive bacteria. For antibiotic treatment against P. aeruginosa, fluoroquinolones, ceftazidime, piperacillin, and imipenem were ideal choices.

- **Conclusion**: The study concludes that…

Typical (non-purulent) cellulitis involves empiric antibiotic regimens for individuals with normal renal function, targeting pathogens such as S. aureus and streptococci, while CA-MRSA remains unusual.

- **Outpatient therapy or step-down**: Administer one of the following oral antibiotics:
	- Amoxicillin-clavulanate 1 g every 8 h
	- Cephalexin 500 mg every 6 h

	- For patients at risk for CA-MRSA, including those with immunocompromised status, recent personal or household contact with MRSA infection or colonization in the past 12 months, prior antibiotic use for 5 days during the last 90 days, cellulitis associated with penetrating trauma, especially from illicit drug use, or those not responding to first-line therapy, add one of the following oral antibiotics:
	- Trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole 160/800–320/1600 mg every 12 h
	- Minocycline 100 mg every 12 h
	- Doxycycline 100 mg every 12 h

- **In patients with beta-lactam allergy**: Use Clindamycin 300 mg every 8 h.

- **Inpatient therapy**: Administer one of the following intravenous antibiotics:
	- Cefazolin 2 g every 8 h
	- Amoxicillin-clavulanate 1.2/2.2 g every 8 h

	- For patients at risk for CA-MRSA, including those who are critically ill, have immunocompromised status, recent personal or household contact with MRSA infection or colonization in the past 12 months, prior antibiotic use for 5 days during the last 90 days, cellulitis associated with penetrating trauma, especially from illicit drug use, or those not responding to first-line therapy, administer one of the following intravenous antibiotics:
	- Vancomycin 25–30 mg/kg loading dose then 15–20 mg/kg/dose every 12 h
	- Linezolid 600 mg every 12 h

### Who can have parenteral antibiotics at home? A prospective observational study in children with moderate/severe cellulitis [^1164f7aQ]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2016). Low credibility.

The benefits of treating children at home or in an ambulatory setting have been well documented. We aimed to describe the characteristics and evaluate the outcomes of children with moderate/severe cellulitis treated at home with intravenous (IV) ceftriaxone via direct referral from the Emergency Department to a hospital-in-the-home (HITH) program.

- **Methods**: Patients aged 3 months to 18 years with moderate/severe cellulitis were referred from a tertiary pediatric Emergency Department to HITH from September 2012 to January 2014. They were prospectively identified. Data collection included demographics, clinical features, microbiological characteristics, and outcomes. To ensure home treatment did not result in inferior outcomes, these patients were retrospectively compared with patients who were hospitalized for IV flucloxacillin, the standard-of-care over the same period. The primary outcome was home treatment failure necessitating hospital admission. Secondary outcomes included antibiotic changes, complications, length of stay, and cost.

- **Results**: Forty-one (28%) patients were treated on HITH and 103 (72%) were hospitalized. Compared with hospitalized patients, HITH patients were older (P < 0.01) and less likely to have periorbital cellulitis (P = 0.01) or fever (P = 0.04). There were no treatment failures under HITH care. The rate of antibiotic changes was similar in both groups (5% vs. 7%, P = 0.67), as was IV antibiotic duration (2.3 vs. 2.5 days, P = 0.23).

- **Conclusion**: Older children with moderate/severe limb cellulitis without systemic symptoms can be treated at home.

### Inpatient preseptal cellulitis: Experience from a tertiary eye care centre [^117UwyvR]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2008). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to describe the causes of preseptal cellulitis (PSC) and the outcomes of treatment in patients admitted to a tertiary eye-care centre.

Methods: A 15-year review (January 1991 to December 2005) of inpatients with clinical signs and symptoms or radiological evidence suggestive of PSC was conducted. Patients with infection anterior to the orbital septum, characterized by acute onset of eyelid oedema, tenderness, erythema, warmth, and chemosis, were included in the study.

Results: Among the 104 patients (64 males, 40 females) meeting the diagnostic criteria for PSC, acute dacryocystitis (ADC) was the most common predisposing cause, affecting 32.6% of the patients, followed by sinusitis/upper-respiratory infection (URI) in 28.8% and trauma/recent surgery in 27.8%. Fifty percent required surgical intervention, including dacryocystorhinostomy/probing/stenting in 74% and abscess/chalazian drainage in 28.8%. Microbiological investigations were conducted in 38.5% of the patients who underwent surgical intervention, with positive cultures in 90%. The most common micro-organisms recovered included Staphylococcus and Streptococcus species, followed by Haemophilus influenzae and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Blood cultures were positive in two of the 34 patients from whom blood was drawn. Most patients responded to systemic antibiotics, leading to the resolution of PSC. However, seven patients developed late complications, including subacute lid abscesses, eyelid necrosis, and cicatricial ectropion.

Conclusions: Sinusitis/URI, ADC, and a recent history of trauma or surgery were the most common causes of PSC in admitted patients.

### A rare case of microblading-induced preseptal cellulitis [^11158rQn]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Cosmetic tattooing has gained popularity over the past several decades. Microblading is a method of semipermanent eyebrow tattooing that has become mainstream in recent years. With this technique, individuals receive eyebrow pigment that lasts longer and is more convenient than the traditional eyebrow pencil. Other forms of semipermanent makeup include lip blush, eyebrow tattoos, eyeliner tattoos, freckle tattoos, and scar camouflage. Infection is a rare but major complication of cosmetic tattooing that is seldom documented in the literature. Here, we report a case of preseptal cellulitis secondary to microblading in a middle-aged woman with sickle cell disease (SCD).

### Unique presentation of cavernous sinus thrombosis in a paediatric patient [^111x6z8K]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

- **Differential diagnosis**: Differential diagnosis included preseptal cellulitis, orbital cellulitis, subperiosteal abscess, and cavernous sinus thrombosis. The patient's worsening clinical findings and lack of improvement on oral antibiotics led to a raised suspicion for a more severe process. The clinical presentation, in addition to imaging results, helped narrow the diagnosis to cavernous sinus thrombosis.

Based on the acute clinical presentation and progression, as well as diagnostic findings suggestive of sinusitis and meningitis, the most likely aetiology was an infectious cause. This was further supported by the patient's improvement in clinical status. Other potential aetiologies that were considered in the evaluation included malignancy, inflammatory disease, and hypercoagulability. However, these were considered less likely due to the absence of supporting clinical symptoms and diagnostic findings.

### Herpes zoster ophthalmicus following platelet-rich plasma therapy for androgenetic alopecia [^1163SE9G]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

A man in his 60s developed herpes zoster ophthalmicus (HZO) with secondary preseptal cellulitis after receiving platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injections for androgenetic alopecia. Despite initial treatment for a suspected allergic reaction and bacterial cellulitis, his condition worsened until HZO was confirmed, and he was treated with both intravenous antivirals and antibiotics. This is the second reported case of HZO following PRP in the literature, suggesting a rare potential adverse reaction. The temporal and anatomical association strongly implicates PRP as a trigger, possibly due to immune modulation or contamination. Standardized PRP protocols and administration by trained medical professionals are crucial to mitigate risks.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^117FPjLw]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). High credibility.

The IDSA 2014 guidelines provide recommendations on managing specific circumstances of cellulitis, particularly in patients with febrile neutropenia. For infections caused by Aspergillus, the guidelines suggest administering voriconazole, or alternatively, using lipid formulations of amphotericin B, posaconazole, or an echinocandin for 6–12 weeks. For Mucor/Rhizopus infections, the administration of lipid formulation amphotericin B or posaconazole is recommended. Adding an echinocandin may also be considered for these infections.

### Periorbital cellulitis — a mistaken diagnosis [^113Hy7nG]. BMJ Case Reports (2011). Low credibility.

A 12-year-old girl presented with a 1-week history of orbital swelling associated with granuloma, purulent discharge from the eye, and preauricular and submandibular lymphadenopathy. Initial conventional treatment for presumed preseptal cellulitis was unsuccessful. Despite treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics, the preseptal cellulitis progressed to orbital cellulitis, with restriction of eye movements in addition to the marked conjunctival chemosis and haemorrhage. A detailed history revealed she had been in close contact with newborn kittens at home, and a biopsy of the granuloma demonstrated Bartonella species, confirming the diagnosis of cat scratch disease. The child received a course of appropriate oral and topical antibiotics and steroids. Unfortunately, eyesight in the right eye remains poor on follow-up.

### Case of leprosy mimicking preseptal cellulitis: A diagnostic dilemma [^1165vFss]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

A 36-year-old Asian man presented with swelling over the left frontal region involving the upper eyelids, with associated erythema and tenderness for a one-month duration. Clinically, he was diagnosed with preseptal cellulitis; however, the lesion did not improve on broad-spectrum systemic antibiotics. CT showed superficial soft tissue swelling in the forehead extending to the superior part of the orbit. Histopathological assessment of the lesion revealed clusters of epithelioid cells with multinucleate giant cells in the dermis, along with perivascular and periadnexal lymphocytic infiltrates, suggestive of leprosy. The patient was started on oral steroids with multidrug therapy, following which the patient showed early resolution of the lesion within 10 days of treatment.

Leprosy is endemic in India, with reactional episodes mimicking other inflammatory and infective etiologies, making diagnosis difficult. Leprosy should be present in an ophthalmologist's diagnostic repertoire while dealing with periorbital swellings for early clinical diagnosis and favorable outcomes.

### Imaging findings of the orbital and intracranial complications of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis [^117G5M13]. Insights into Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

- **Isolated preseptal cellulitis**: Axial ceCT image in soft tissue window showing a thickened and infiltrated eyelid (short arrow); the postseptal fat (long arrows) looks impeccable. Note the absence of signs of infection in the ethmoid sinus.

- **Preseptal abscess**: Axial ceCT image in soft tissue window showing a heterogeneous collection in the right eyelid with rim-enhancement (*) indicative of preseptal abscess; note the adjacent opacification of the ethmoid sinus (E) indicative of ethmoiditis.

Orbital cellulitis refers to oedema and inflammation of the orbital contents without abscess formation. Proptosis and impaired eye movement are reliable signs of orbital cellulitis; also, chemosis is usually present. At this stage, loss of vision is still rare. The vision should, however, be monitored. On CT, orbital cellulitis results in smudging of the intraorbital fat usually in combination with preseptal cellulitis (Fig. 5). If the CT findings are unclear and orbital cellulitis is still suspected, MRI may be of help. Especially fat saturated T2 weighted MR sequences (like STIR) are highly sensitive to inflammatory changes in the orbit and should be included in every MRI protocol for orbital imaging. In addition, DWI can aid in the differentiation between orbital cellulitis and entities with overlapping imaging characteristics like orbital inflammatory syndrome and lymphoid lesions.

### Frontal osteomyelitis presenting as chronic preseptal abscess: An unusual scenario [^111krVRZ]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Low credibility.

Preseptal cellulitis is characterized by local inflammation anterior to the orbital septum. This case report highlights a rare cause of chronic preseptal inflammation: frontal osteomyelitis. The patient initially presented with chronic left upper lid swelling following minor blunt trauma of four months duration. The condition did not respond to medical treatment. Drainage of the swelling was performed, and pus was sent for culture and sensitivity; the results were negative. The swelling rapidly recollected following drainage. The patient had no nasal complaints or constitutional manifestations. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging were used to diagnose the extent of sinus involvement and frontal osteomyelitis. Clindamycin therapy was administered for four weeks, after which the patient markedly improved.

### Things are not always what they seem: Two cases of child maltreatment presenting with common pediatric chief complaints [^113RbyYW]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2019). Low credibility.

We describe two cases of child maltreatment that presented as common pediatric conditions: preseptal cellulitis and gastroenteritis. The first case involves an 8-year-old girl who presented with progressive right eye pain, swelling, and discharge. She was initially treated for preseptal cellulitis, but eye cultures ultimately grew Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Further investigation revealed sexual abuse by a male family member. The second case involves a 2-year-old previously healthy girl who presented with six hours of emesis, lethargy, and abdominal pain. Initially attributed to viral gastroenteritis, her serum blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels were higher than expected for her clinical course. She later developed signs of peritonitis and was ultimately found to have a large bladder wall defect secondary to inflicted blunt abdominal trauma. These cases are presented to emphasize the need for pediatricians to consider child abuse even when patients present with common pediatric complaints.

### Delayed resolution of eyelid swelling in preseptal cellulitis in a child: Beware of causing occlusion amblyopia [^113NDmHr]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Low credibility.

A 7-month-old child presented with a 6-day history of right eyelid swelling and redness. She was being treated with chloramphenicol ointment and oral flucloxacillin by the general practitioner. Clinical examination revealed features of preseptal cellulitis. There was no evidence of orbital involvement, and the child was generally well otherwise. Her oral antibiotics were changed, and she was advised to attend for a review in 2 days' time.

However, the child did not return for a review. Three weeks later, following the resolution of the eyelid swelling, the child presented with a divergent squint in the right eye. Clinical and orthoptic investigations suggested occlusion amblyopia. The child is currently receiving patching treatment for the amblyopia and is awaiting surgery for the squint eye.

### Frontal osteomyelitis presenting as chronic preseptal abscess: An unusual scenario [^11573kDL]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Low credibility.

Preseptal cellulitis is defined as inflammation located anterior to the orbital septum. It is typically acute, more common in the pediatric age group, and has various etiologies, such as insect bites, trauma, and spread from sinusitis. If left untreated, it may progress to orbital cellulitis, which can compromise vision through optic nerve involvement, cavernous sinus thrombosis, corneal exposure, and ophthalmoplegia. We present a rare case of chronic preseptal cellulitis (abscess) secondary to chronic frontal osteomyelitis. Our purpose is to shed light on this rare cause of preseptal inflammation, aiming to avoid delayed diagnosis and prevent serious complications.

### Prevention and treatment of recurrent cellulitis [^111e2hiG]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Recurrent cellulitis is a challenging clinical condition affecting up to 47% of patients after the first episode, particularly those with predisposing risk factors. The purpose of this review is to describe the state of the art of literature evidence and to highlight recent developments in its management.

- **Recent findings**: Recurrent cellulitis can occur after the successful treatment of an initial episode. Conditions that commonly increase the risk of cellulitis include local and systemic modifiable and nonmodifiable factors. A rigorous approach to managing these risk factors and treating acute infections is important, as the risk of recurrence rises with repeated episodes. Risk factors, if present, need to be targeted alongside antibiotic prophylaxis. Penicillin V is the preferred antibiotic for prevention, but other antibiotics and new drugs can be considered in cases of β-lactam allergy, intolerance, or failure.

Recurrent cellulitis is associated with both short-term and long-term morbidity, as well as significant healthcare costs. Managing underlying predisposing conditions is crucial to preventing recurrence, in addition to evaluating pharmacological measures. Specialized and multidisciplinary skills are needed. More efforts are needed to prevent and treat this underestimated problem.

### Ct and MR imaging of orbital inflammation [^114cZogF]. Neuroradiology (2018). Low credibility.

A 68-year-old male with Still's disease presents with inflammatory dacryoadenitis on the left. Axial contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) shows an enlarged lacrimal gland (dashed arrow) with slight blurred margins and preseptal cellulitis (arrow), consistent with dacryoadenitis. The coexistence of preseptal cellulitis makes the diagnosis of a tumor improbable.

A 54-year-old female with Sjögren's disease shows bilateral inflammatory dacryoadenitis. Coronal T2-weighted imaging with fat signal suppression reveals bilateral enlargement of the lacrimal gland, involving both the orbital (dashed arrow) and palpebral (arrowhead) lobes. This feature is typical of dacryoadenitis but can also occur in lymphomas. The levator palpebrae tendon, which separates the orbital and palpebral lobes, is indicated by arrows.

### A rare case of microblading-induced preseptal cellulitis [^11418xQv]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Prompt evaluation and treatment of preseptal cellulitis are essential as it may progress to orbital cellulitis with more life-threatening complications, including orbital abscess, cavernous sinus thrombosis, and encephalomeningitis. This case highlights the potential risks associated with cosmetic tattooing practices, which are especially important to consider if improper sanitation and hygiene are present. It is important to seek immediate medical attention if periorbital erythema, swelling, or cutaneous eruptions, such as vesicles or pustules, develop.

In addition, people with SCD are at an increased risk for infections, but there are currently no recommendations to administer prophylactic antimicrobial treatment before performing cosmetic tattooing in these individuals. Therefore, additional counseling regarding risks should be provided by the aesthetician or other cosmetic personnel before initiating any tattoo procedure.

Counsel regarding the following:

- **Keep draining wounds covered** with clean, dry bandages.

- **Maintain good personal hygiene** with regular bathing and cleaning of hands with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand gel, particularly after touching infected skin or an item that has directly contacted a draining wound.

- **Avoid reusing or sharing personal items**: such as disposable razors, linens, and towels, that have contacted infected skin.

### Prophylactic antibiotics for the prevention of cellulitis (erysipelas) of the leg: Results of the UK Dermatology Clinical Trials Network's PATCH II trial [^114FmLXa]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Data collection was achieved through routine telephone follow-up calls from the coordinating centre — which occurred 3-monthly during the treatment phase and 6-monthly during the follow-up phase. Participants were asked to complete a study diary to record adverse events and health service resource use. If participants experienced a repeat episode of cellulitis, they were instructed to inform the trial staff immediately. Any repeat episodes not reported were identified during the regular telephone interviews.

Health service resource use was captured using diaries and included inpatient admissions, outpatient visits, GP consultations, other prescribed drugs for cellulitis, and time away from normal daily activities.

The primary outcome measure for the trial was the time to the next episode of cellulitis. The next confirmed episode was defined as the subsequent episode of cellulitis (in either leg), reported by the participant and confirmed by a medical practitioner. The episode was considered to have started on the first day of symptoms as reported by the participant. Episodes that were self-reported by the participant and led to antibiotic treatment, but were not confirmed by a medical professional, were documented as self-reported cases and included in the sensitivity analysis.

Secondary outcome measures included:

- **Proportion of participants with repeat episodes**: At the end of the treatment phase and at the end of the nonintervention follow-up phase.
- **Number of repeat episodes of cellulitis**: A count was maintained to assess recurrence.
- **Proportion of participants with new oedema and/or ulceration**: Evaluation was conducted to identify new cases.

### Improving antibiotic use in pediatric preseptal cellulitis using a clinical practice guideline [^114qvqxM]. Hospital Pediatrics (2024). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of a clinical practice guideline (CPG) on antibiotic use and resource utilization for pediatric preseptal cellulitis.

This retrospective quasiexperimental study included patients between the age of 2 months and 17 years admitted for preseptal cellulitis between January 2013 and December 2023. The preseptal cellulitis CPG was implemented in December 2020 using a multifaceted strategy that included buy-in from key stakeholders, education of frontline providers, the official CPG launch, and stakeholder check-ins. The primary outcome was the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, including dual/triple therapy and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) active antibiotics. The secondary outcome was resource utilization including blood testing and imaging. Outcomes were compared pre- and post-CPG implementation using the Fisher exact test and logistic regressions.

Of 236 patients meeting inclusion criteria, 175 and 61 patients composed the pre- and post-CPG cohorts, respectively. Median age (interquartile range) was 4.0 (1.8–8.3) years and 46% of the population were female. Post-CPG implementation changes in empirical antibiotic use included decreases in broad-spectrum use from 100% to 66% (P < .001), dual/triple therapy from 47% to 16% (P < .001), and MRSA active agents from 86% to 26% (P < .001). There was a decrease in complete blood count and blood culture orders from 75% to 57% (P = .014) and 32% to 18% (P = .047), respectively.

### Early response in cellulitis: A prospective study of dynamics and predictors [^114FkQR8]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Longer duration of symptoms before admission was among the factors related to early response. This association has, to our knowledge, previously not been demonstrated. Like the response seen after nonantibiotic treatment, this may be related to the natural course of disease; many of those with longer duration may have passed the maximum intensity of infection and inflammation.

The impact of treatment choice on early response was demonstrated as early as the 1930s. However, recent clinical trials using early clinical response as the primary endpoint have not demonstrated significant differences between the drugs tested, apart from a difference in early response found in a study assessing this new outcome measure retrospectively. In our study, discordant treatment was infrequent as a result of the predominance of streptococcal etiology and rare resistance among these microbes. We found no correlation between discordant treatment and early nonresponse, but the effective sample size was small. However, antibiotic choice may be important beyond its relation to in vitro sensitivity. A recent retrospective study demonstrating an association between early clinical response and higher vancomycin trough concentration illustrates that drug-specific factors are also important for early response. The paucity of reports showing significant associations between initial treatment and early response underscores that in cellulitis, discordant therapy or other pharmacological factors are not the major causes of early failure.

### Do patients with cellulitis need to be hospitalized? A systematic review and meta-analysis of mortality rates of inpatients with cellulitis [^114RuFHK]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Cellulitis is a common cause of hospitalization. In the United States, the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) code "other cellulitis and abscess" accounts for 1.4% of all admissions and $5.5 billion in annual costs. The Infectious Disease Society of America recommends hospitalization for patients with cellulitis under certain circumstances; however, there is little actual clinical evidence to guide the decision to admit. The purpose of this study is to determine the mortality rate of patients hospitalized with cellulitis and to ascertain if the rate is comparable to the rate for low-risk patients with community-acquired pneumonia, who are currently recommended for outpatient management.

- **Methods**: A systematic literature search was conducted for studies of consecutive patients hospitalized with cellulitis or erysipelas that reported inpatient mortality. Study quality was assessed using a modified Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale. The mortality rates from the included studies were pooled using a random effects model. Heterogeneity was estimated using the I² statistic.

- **Results**: Eighteen studies met the inclusion criteria. The overall worldwide mortality rate was 1.1% (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.7–1.8). For studies from the United States, the rate was 0.5% (95% CI 0.3–0.9). The actual cause of death was generally poorly described, and only one-third of deaths appeared to be due to infection.

- **Discussion**: The estimated mortality rate for patients currently being hospitalized for cellulitis is comparable to the mortality rate of patients with community-acquired pneumonia.

### WSES/GAIS/WSIS/SIS-E/AAST global clinical pathways for patients with skin and soft tissue infections [^112RXUEh]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Incision and drainage are recommended as primary management for abscesses with associated cellulitis. In these cases, antibiotics are generally suggested.

- **Empiric antibiotic regimens for normal renal function**:
	- **Target pathogen**: S. aureus, including CA-MRSA.
	- **Outpatient therapy or step-down**: One of the following oral antibiotics:
		- Amoxicillin-clavulanate 1 g every 8 hours
		- Cephalexin 500 mg every 6 hours

	- **In regions or populations with a high prevalence of CA-MRSA**: Where > 10% of clinical S. aureus isolates are MRSA isolates, or in patients at high risk for CA-MRSA, use:
		- Trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole 160/800–320/1600 mg every 12 hours
		- Minocycline 100 mg every 12 hours
		- Doxycycline 100 mg every 12 hours

	- **Inpatient therapy**: One of the following intravenous antibiotics:
		- Vancomycin 25–30 mg/kg loading dose, then 15–20 mg/kg/dose every 12 hours
		- Linezolid 600 mg every 12 hours

- **For patients at risk for Gram-negative infections or severe forms**: Those who do not respond to first-line therapy, consider:
	- Piperacillin/tazobactam 4.5 g every 6 hours.

Culture is not recommended as a principal method for identifying the causative bacteria in cellulitis patients. However, in immunosuppressed patients, those with neutropenia, or in severe forms associated with systemic signs of inflammation that do not respond to first-line therapy, culture may be helpful to identify the causative bacteria and define a targeted therapy.

Cellulitis in the following situations can be life-threatening, thus requiring early diagnosis and prompt intervention:

- **Orbital cellulitis**: The infection usually spreads from paranasal sinuses.

### Preseptal cellulitis caused by trichophyton (ringworm) [^1144V7ep]. Cornea (2002). Low credibility.

A 10-year-old boy with a past medical history significant for chickenpox at 7 years of age was referred to our eye center by an outside ophthalmologist for a 15-day history of worsening right-sided preseptal cellulitis. The patient reported photophobia, pruritus, and pain in the eyelid region. There appeared to be vesicular lesions on the eyelids. Empiric therapy with oral antibacterial and antiviral medications failed to resolve the preseptal cellulitis. Lid cultures revealed coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, Streptococcal viridans, and a Trichophyton species of fungus. The infection was successfully treated with two courses of oral itraconazole. This is the first case of preseptal cellulitis caused by this dermatophyte that we could find in the literature.

### Predictors of failure of empiric outpatient antibiotic therapy in emergency department patients with uncomplicated cellulitis [^1175UPek]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Despite several expert panel recommendations and cellulitis treatment guidelines, there are currently no clinical decision rules to assist clinicians in deciding which emergency department (ED) patients should be treated with oral antibiotics and which patients require intravenous (IV) therapy at the first presentation of cellulitis amenable to outpatient treatment.

- **Objectives**: The objective was to determine risk factors associated with adult patients presenting to the ED with cellulitis who fail initial antibiotic therapy as outpatients and require a change of antibiotics or admission to the hospital.

- **Methods**: This was a prospective cohort study of patients 18 years of age or older presenting with cellulitis to one of two tertiary care EDs (combined annual census 140,000). Patients were excluded if they had been treated with antibiotics for the cellulitis before presenting to the ED, if they were admitted to the hospital, or if they had an abscess only. Trained research personnel administered a questionnaire at the initial ED visit with telephone follow-up 2 weeks later. Multivariable logistic regression models determined predictor variables independently associated with treatment failure (failed initial antibiotic therapy and required a change of antibiotics or admission to hospital).

- **Results**: A total of 598 patients were enrolled, 52 were excluded, and 49 were lost to follow-up. The mean (± standard deviation [SD]) age was 53.1 (± 18.4) years and 56.4% were male. A total of 185 patients (37.2%) were given oral antibiotics, 231 (46.5%) were given IV antibiotics.

### Cellulitis: Diagnosis and management [^113EYPpq]. Dermatologic Therapy (2011). Low credibility.

Cellulitis is an acute infection of the dermal and subcutaneous layers of the skin, often occurring after local skin trauma. It is a common diagnosis in both inpatient and outpatient dermatology, as well as in the primary care setting. Cellulitis classically presents with erythema, swelling, warmth, and tenderness over the affected area.

There are many other dermatologic diseases that can present with similar findings, highlighting the need to consider a broad differential diagnosis. Some of the most common mimics of cellulitis include venous stasis dermatitis, contact dermatitis, deep vein thrombosis, and panniculitis. History, local characteristics of the affected area, systemic signs, laboratory tests, and, in some cases, skin biopsy can be helpful in confirming the correct diagnosis.

Most patients can be treated as outpatients with oral antibiotics, with dicloxacillin or cephalexin being the oral therapy of choice when methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus is not a concern.

### Clinical response to antibiotic regimens in lower limb cellulitis: A systematic review [^111DTneb]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2021). Low credibility.

There is variation in the treatment of lower limb cellulitis (LLC) with no consensus on the most effective antibiotic regimen. Many patients with cellulitis fail to respond to first-line antibiotics, which can negatively affect patient care and result in unnecessary hospital admissions. This systematic review aimed to determine the clinical response and safety of antibiotic regimens for the management of LLC. A systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was conducted using OVID MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials in January 2019.

Outcomes of interest included the clinical response to antibiotic regimens, considering type, dose, route, and duration, as well as the safety of antibiotics in treating LLC. Trial quality was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool.

Four RCTs were included in the review. All included studies showed no significant differences in clinical response based on antibiotic type, administration route, treatment duration, or dose. This suggests that LLC may be overtreated and that shorter courses of oral antibiotics, possibly with lower doses, may be more suitable. There is a lack of published data on the clinical response and safety of antibiotics in LLC, and three studies were identified as having a high risk for bias overall. Further high-quality studies may help determine whether less intensive antibiotic regimens can effectively treat LLC.

In relation to cellulitis, particularly in patients with febrile neutropenia, the IDSA 2014 guidelines recommend adding empiric antifungal therapy to the antibacterial regimen. This recommendation is based on the fact that yeasts and molds are the primary cause of infection associated with persistent fever and neutropenia. Additionally, empiric vancomycin or other agents with Gram-positive activity, such as linezolid, daptomycin, or ceftaroline, should be administered if they are not already part of the treatment. It is also advocated to administer therapy for antibiotic-resistant bacterial organisms in patients who are currently on antibiotics.

### Cellulitis [^117Sz9yf]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2021). Low credibility.

Cellulitis is a common infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissue caused predominantly by gram-positive organisms. Risk factors include prior episodes of cellulitis, cutaneous lesions, tinea pedis, and chronic edema. Cellulitis is a clinical diagnosis and presents with localized skin erythema, edema, warmth, and tenderness. Uncomplicated cellulitis can be managed in the outpatient setting with oral antibiotics. Imaging often is not required but can be helpful. Recurrent cellulitis is common, and predisposing conditions should be assessed for and treated at the time of initial diagnosis. For patients with frequent recurrences despite management of underlying conditions, antimicrobial prophylaxis can be effective.

Upon arrival to the inpatient service, the patient was disoriented, afebrile, and tachycardic with a heart rate of 109. Laboratory studies were significant for a white blood cell increase from 17 to 25 × 10³/μL (reference range, 4.0–10.0 × 10³/μL). Venous blood gas showed evidence of metabolic acidosis (pH 7.21; pCO2, 47; HCO3, 18.8; lactate, 6.8). She was initially treated for empiric sepsis with intravenous fluids, vancomycin, and piperacillin-tazobactam. Blood cultures were negative. Intravenous morphine was administered for pain, both secondary to the facial eruption and from SCD.

A head computed tomography scan and brain magnetic resonance imaging showed no septal involvement of cellulitis. After a rapid improvement in mental status, she was transitioned to a 7-day course of oral sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim and cephalexin. Dermatology was consulted, and on clinical examination, she was found to have periorbital hyperpigmented and mildly erythematous desquamative eczematous patches without erythema, induration, pustules, vesicles, or bullae.

Clinical improvement in dermatitis and pruritus was observed following the initiation of 2.5% hydrocortisone cream twice a day for 1 week and petroleum jelly daily. The pain was well controlled after initiation of hydromorphone patient-controlled analgesia.

### Interventions for the prevention of recurrent erysipelas and cellulitis [^1139Z69g]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Erysipelas and cellulitis (hereafter referred to as 'cellulitis') are common bacterial skin infections usually affecting the lower extremities. Despite their burden of morbidity, the evidence for different prevention strategies is unclear.

- **Objectives**: To assess the beneficial and adverse effects of antibiotic prophylaxis or other prophylactic interventions for the prevention of recurrent episodes of cellulitis in adults aged over 16.

- **Search methods**: We searched the following databases up to June 2016: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS. We also searched five trials registry databases and checked reference lists of included studies and reviews for further references to relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Two sets of dermatology conference proceedings and BIOSIS Previews were also searched.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials evaluating any therapy for the prevention of recurrent cellulitis.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors independently carried out study selection, data extraction, assessment of risks of bias, and analyses. Our primary prespecified outcome was recurrence of cellulitis when on treatment and after treatment. Our secondary outcomes included incidence rate, time to next episode, hospitalisation, quality of life, development of resistance to antibiotics, adverse reactions, and mortality.

- **Main results**: We included six trials, with a total of 573 evaluable participants, who were aged on average between 50 and 70.

### Epidemiology and management of orbital cellulitis in children [^1148n7j5]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2022). Low credibility.

The epidemiology of orbital cellulitis has likely evolved due to the emergence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and the adoption of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination. In the absence of published guidelines, management is highly variable. We characterized epidemiology and management over an 11-year period.

- **Methods**: A retrospective cohort study of children aged 0 to 21 years with orbital cellulitis, with or without a subperiosteal orbital abscess, was conducted. These cases were hospitalized at a large quaternary children's hospital from January 2008 to June 2018. We reviewed charts for demographic characteristics, clinical features, management, and outcomes. Using multivariable logistic regression, we evaluated predictors of surgical intervention and assessed whether corticosteroid use or antibiotic duration was related to clinical outcomes.

- **Results**: Among 220 patients, methicillin-susceptible S. aureus was the most common organism (26.3%), with MRSA found in only 5.0% of cases. Rates of vancomycin use fluctuated annually from 40.9% to 84.6%. Surgery was performed in 39.5% of the patients. Corticosteroids were used in 70 patients (32.1%) and were unrelated to treatment failure (n = 9), defined as persistent signs and symptoms or initial clinical improvement followed by worsening (P = .137). The median antibiotic duration was 17 days (interquartile range 14–26). After controlling for age, gender, proptosis, eye pain with movement, eyelid swelling, neutrophil count, and corticosteroid use, treatment failure was not significantly associated with the receipt of ≥ 3 weeks of antibiotic therapy (8/84, 9.5%).

### Early response in cellulitis: A prospective study of dynamics and predictors [^115ZLcDr]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Antibiotic treatment escalation was observed in 34% (69/205) of cases, mostly within two days of treatment initiation. Among cases with such early escalation, 90% (37/41) exhibited nonresponse at day 1. Most cases with nonresponse at day 1 and treatment escalation within day 2 showed a response by day 3, though not as frequently as those without escalation (73% [24/33] vs. 91% [75/82]; p = 0.009). Treatment escalation within day 2 was rarely associated with inappropriate initial therapy (2/40 [5%]) and was common in both cases with confirmed or probable BHS etiology (32/173 [19%]) and other cases (8/39 [27%]). A long duration of therapy was strongly associated with nonresponse at day 3, but not with nonresponse at day 1. Surgical treatment escalation was clearly more prevalent in cases with nonresponse at day 3.

Nonresponse at days 1 and 3 was not significantly linked to clinical failure, but nonresponse at day 3 indicated a complicated, resource-demanding course. Sensitivity analysis with replacement of missing response data produced similar results.

### Changes in the management of severe orbital infections over seventeen years [^111BipRL]. Hospital Pediatrics (2021). Low credibility.

Periorbital and orbital cellulitis are common but serious infections in children. The management of these infections varies because of an absence of clinical guidelines, but it is unclear if management within institutions has changed over time. We compared the management and outcomes of children hospitalized with periorbital and orbital cellulitis in two eras.

- **Methods**: Data were extracted from records of children hospitalized at a tertiary care children's hospital with periorbital or orbital cellulitis from 2000 to 2005 and 2012 to 2016. Patient demographics, cross-sectional imaging, antibiotic and corticosteroid use, length of stay, and surgical rates were collected. Data from the eras were compared using descriptive statistics, t-tests, Mann-Whitney U tests, Fisher's exact tests, and χ² tests.

- **Results**: There were 318 children included, 143 from 2000 to 2005 and 175 from 2012 to 2016. Compared with the first era, in the second era there were increased rates of MRI (5% vs. 11%, P = .04), although rates of computed tomography scan use remained unchanged (60% vs. 65%); increased number (1 vs. 3, P < .01) and spectrum of antibiotics; increased use of intranasal corticosteroids (3% vs. 49%, P < .01); and subspecialty consultation (89% vs. 99%, P = .01). There were no differences in length of stay, readmission, or surgical rates between eras.

- **Conclusions**: There has been considerable change in the management of hospitalized children with severe orbital infections at our institution, including the rates of MRI, and the number and spectrum of antibiotics used.

### Outcomes of early dermatology consultation for inpatients diagnosed with cellulitis [^112bQrDj]. JAMA Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Many inflammatory skin dermatoses mimic cellulitis (pseudocellulitis) and are treated with antibiotics and/or hospitalization, leading to unnecessary patient morbidity and substantial health care spending.

- **Objective**: To evaluate the impact of early dermatology consultation on clinical and economic outcomes associated with misdiagnosed cellulitis.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: This prospective cohort study enrolled patients with a presumed diagnosis of cellulitis in the emergency department, in the emergency department observation unit, or within 24 hours of admission to an inpatient unit of a large urban teaching hospital between February and September 2017. Patients were provided with telephone and clinic follow-up during the 30-day postdischarge period. We screened 165 patients with the primary concern of cellulitis. Of these, we excluded 44 who required antibiotics for cutaneous, soft-tissue, and deeper-tissue and/or bone infections irrespective of cellulitis status, and 5 who were scheduled to be discharged by the emergency department.

- **Interventions**: Early dermatology consultation for presumed cellulitis.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Primary outcomes were patient disposition and rates of antibiotic use.

- **Results**: Of 116 patients (63 [54.3%] women; 91 [78.4%] non-Hispanic white; mean [SD] age, 58.4 [19.1] years), 39 (33.6%) were diagnosed with pseudocellulitis by dermatologists. Of these, 34 (87.2%) had started using antibiotics for presumed cellulitis as prescribed by the primary team at the time of enrollment. The dermatology team recommended antibiotics.

### A rare case of microblading-induced preseptal cellulitis [^111KuMYi]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

A 39-year-old woman with SCD presented to the emergency department (ED) with an acute vaso-occlusive pain episode. She was also found to have a significant periocular facial eruption and denied any history of allergies, photosensitivity, or similar skin eruptions. Three weeks before this ED presentation, she underwent an initial microblading procedure for both eyebrows. She was advised by aestheticians to cleanse the area with baby soap and water. One day later, she developed pustules in the malar area of the right cheek, which progressed to bilateral periorbital edema and pustules draining purulent exudate as noted during a virtual urgent care visit 10 days after the initial procedure. During the virtual appointment, cephalexin and mupirocin 2% ointment were prescribed. She denied ophthalmoplegia, pain with eye movements, or blurry vision.

A few days later, the periorbital cutaneous eruption had worsened, and she was encouraged by an ambulatory physician to visit the ED. She presented to the ED at an outside hospital, where she was treated with broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics for presumed cellulitis and sent home with at least a 1-week course of oral clindamycin and a prednisone taper. Initially, the patient noticed an improvement in her eyebrow eruption; however, a few days after discharge, a periocular and perinasal erythematous, scaly, and pruritic eruption developed. She presented to the ED for a second time with a primary concern of an acute pain episode and was found to have bilateral periorbital hyperpigmentation, edema, and erythema.

Regarding specific circumstances for cellulitis, particularly concerning immunocompromised patients, the IDSA 2014 guidelines recommend including drug eruption, cutaneous infiltration with underlying malignancy, chemotherapy- or radiation-induced reactions, Sweet syndrome, erythema multiforme, leukocytoclastic vasculitis, and graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) among allogeneic transplant recipients, in the differential diagnosis of skin lesions for these patients. It is also important to include bacterial, fungal, viral, and parasitic agents in the differential diagnosis for infections of skin lesions.

### Early response in cellulitis: A prospective study of dynamics and predictors [^116zpUYf]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). High credibility.

Skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) are common causes of medical care, with increasing frequency and costs reported. The SSTI that most often requires systemic antibiotics is cellulitis, a diffuse skin infection that includes the superficial subtype known as erysipelas. Cellulitis is usually caused by β-hemolytic streptococci (BHS) that are susceptible to penicillin and other narrow-spectrum antibiotics. However, there are significant treatment challenges, including the overuse of broad-spectrum and intravenous antibiotics, difficulties regarding when to initiate rescue therapy and when to stop treatment, and frequent recurrences. Toxin effects and profound local inflammation, not necessarily corresponding to bacterial burden or antibiotic needs, may contribute to these problems. Additionally, host factors affecting the dynamics of treatment response may adversely impact antibiotic choices and other resource use.

Increasing knowledge on the clinical course, response dynamics, and associated factors may be important in dealing with the challenges of cellulitis care. Optimizing the assessment of treatment response may be a key factor due to its major role in treatment decisions and clinical trials. The standard assessment of response in SSTI trials has been performed after the end of treatment (EOT). However, clinical success post-treatment may often result from natural improvement, as demonstrated by high cure rates following non-antibiotic therapy in studies from the pre-antibiotic and early antibiotic eras.

### Preseptal and orbital cellulitis: Analysis of clinical, laboratory and imaging findings of 123 pediatric cases from Turkey [^113KXkHu]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2022). Low credibility.

We aimed to compare the clinical and laboratory characteristics and imaging methods of patients diagnosed with preseptal cellulitis and orbital cellulitis in the pediatric age group.

- **Methods**: The study was designed retrospectively, and the medical records of all patients who were hospitalized with the diagnosis of preseptal cellulitis and orbital cellulitis were reviewed. The findings of preseptal cellulitis and orbital cellulitis groups were compared. The risk factors for the development of orbital involvement were analyzed.

- **Results**: A total of 123 patients were included, with 90.2% having preseptal cellulitis and 9.8% having orbital cellulitis. The male gender ratio was 60.2%, and the mean age was 72 ± 43 months. While all patients had eyelid swelling and redness, 20.3% had fever. Ocular involvement was noted in 51.2% of the right eyes and 4.9% in both eyes. The most common predisposing factor was rhinosinusitis (56.1%). Radiologic imaging (computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging) was performed in 83.7% of the patients. Subperiosteal abscess was detected in 7 cases (5.6%), with three cases managed surgically and four treated medically. The levels of C-reactive protein were significantly higher in patients with orbital involvement (P = 0.033), but there was no difference in the presence of fever, leukocyte, and platelet values.

- **Conclusions**: Rhinosinusitis was the most common predisposing factor in the development of preseptal cellulitis and orbital cellulitis. Orbital involvement was present in 9.8% of the patients. High C-reactive protein levels were determined in cases with orbital involvement.

### Preseptal versus orbital cellulitis in children: An observational study [^111cvkGX]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2021). Low credibility.

Preseptal and orbital cellulitis are two types of infection surrounding the orbital septum with very different potential outcomes. Our aim was to describe key differential features of both conditions, laying special emphasis on diagnostic and therapeutic tools.

- **Methods**: A retrospective review of patients admitted to a tertiary hospital over a 15-year period (January 2004 - October 2019) was conducted. We included 198 patients with preseptal and 45 with orbital cellulitis. Descriptive statistics were performed to examine the available information.

- **Results**: Statistically significant differences were found between patients with preseptal and orbital cellulitis regarding age (3.9 ± 2.14 vs. 7.5 ± 4.24 years), presence of fever (51.5% vs. 82.2%), and preexisting sinusitis (2% vs. 77.8%) (all P < 0.001). A C-reactive protein > 120 mg/L cut-off point for orbital cellulitis was obtained. Early CT scans were performed in 75.6% of suspected orbital cellulitis cases and helped detect complications at an early stage. Abscesses were revealed in 70.6% of cases, especially medial subperiosteal abscesses (58.8%). All patients received intravenous antibiotics, whereas corticosteroids were preferred in patients with orbital involvement (8.6% vs. 73.3%, P < 0.001). Only 26.7% of patients required additional surgery.

- **Conclusions**: Clinical differentiation between preseptal and orbital cellulitis is crucial for appropriate management. Prompt recognition and intervention can prevent serious complications associated with orbital cellulitis.

### Ambulatory intravenous antibiotic therapy for children with preseptal cellulitis [^117KqU2Z]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2012). Low credibility.

This study aimed to compare the use of outpatient ambulatory care versus admission for intravenous antibiotics in the management of preseptal cellulitis.

- **Methods**: This is a retrospective consecutive cohort study of children younger than 16 years presenting to an Inner London Paediatric Emergency Department with signs and symptoms of preseptal cellulitis.

- **Results**: A total of 94 cases were identified during a 17-month period. Of them, 30 children were prescribed oral antibiotics. One child did not receive treatment. Of the 63 children prescribed with intravenous antibiotics, 42 were managed on an ambulatory basis and 21 were admitted. There was no significant difference in the duration of treatment in days between those on ambulatory management and those admitted (2.79 ± 0.8 vs. 2.76 ± 1.9, P = 0.94) or in the rate of complications. The net cost saving was $205,924 (£131,065; €147,578) overall, equal to $4900 (£3120; €3513) per patient.

- **Conclusions**: Ambulatory intravenous antibiotics with daily review are a safe and cost-effective alternative to inpatient admission in simple preseptal cellulitis for children in our population who require parenteral antibiotics.

### Effect of dermatology consultation on outcomes for patients with presumed cellulitis: A randomized clinical trial [^1114XDHs]. JAMA Dermatology (2018). High credibility.

Each year, cellulitis leads to 650,000 hospital admissions and is estimated to cost $3.7 billion in the United States. Previous literature has demonstrated a high misdiagnosis rate for cellulitis, which results in unnecessary antibiotic use and healthcare costs.

- **Objective**: To determine whether dermatologic consultation decreases the duration of hospital stay or intravenous antibiotic treatment duration in patients with cellulitis.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: This randomized clinical trial was conducted in a large urban tertiary care hospital between October 2012 and January 2017, with a 1-month follow-up duration. Patients were randomized to the control group, which received the standard of care (i.e. treatment by the primary medicine team), or the intervention group, which received dermatology consultation. A medical chart review of demographic information and hospital courses was performed. Adult patients hospitalized with a presumed diagnosis of cellulitis were eligible. A total of 1300 patients were screened, 1125 were excluded, and 175 were included. Statistical analysis was employed to identify significant outcome differences between the two groups.

- **Interventions**: Dermatology consultation within 24 hours of hospitalization.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Length of hospital stay and duration of intravenous antibiotic treatment.

Results indicated that of the 175 participants, 70 (40%) were women and 105 (60%) were men. The mean age was 58.8 years. The length of hospital stay was not statistically different between the two groups. The duration of intravenous antibiotic treatment was less than four days…

### A rare case of microblading-induced preseptal cellulitis [^111esQn1]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Generally, cosmetic tattooing is thought to be a safe procedure with minimal side effects. Few adverse reactions from permanent or semipermanent makeup were reported to the Food and Drug Administration before 2003. However, between 2003 and 2004, over 150 complaints from permanent makeup were received by the Food and Drug Administration. Mild side effects of cosmetic tattoos include swelling, tenderness, and bleeding. However, allergic, granulomatous, and hyperplastic reactions to cosmetic tattoo inks have been described. Proper hygienic practices are particularly important to reduce the spread of bacterial infections. Although rare, cases of atypical mycobacterial infection in the setting of permanent makeup application to the eyebrows have been reported. Our patient represents an interesting clinical case of preseptal cellulitis secondary to microblading in an adult woman with SCD.

Preseptal or periorbital cellulitis is an infection of the tissue anterior to the orbital septum and should be suspected in patients with a history of sinusitis or periorbital trauma who present with periorbital erythema and eyelid swelling, especially unilaterally. In contrast, orbital cellulitis is an infection and inflammation of the soft tissue posterior to the septum. To diagnose preseptal cellulitis, clinical signs of orbital involvement, such as proptosis, diminished visual acuity, painful eye movement, and ophthalmoplegia with diplopia must be excluded. If the uncertainty of the diagnosis remains or orbital cellulitis is suspected, computed tomography with contrast of the septum is recommended.

### Frontal osteomyelitis presenting as chronic preseptal abscess: an unusual scenario [^116wHmo8]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Low credibility.

Frontal osteomyelitis can occur following acute sinusitis, trauma, or sinus surgery. Occurring in the frontal bone is unusual for chronic osteomyelitis and is characteristically associated with "Pott's puffy tumor", named after Percival Pott in 1768. This condition involves forehead swelling due to the destruction of the outer table of the frontal bone and is considered life-threatening because of the potential for intracranial spread, either directly through sinus wall destruction or indirectly through diploic veins. It is notable that intracranial complications mainly occur in adolescents, correlated with the pneumatization process of the frontal sinus and the peak of diploic circulation.

Commonly reported symptoms of frontal osteomyelitis include headache, purulent rhinorrhea, fever, tenderness of the frontal sinus, and swelling of the forehead. Intracranial complications in adolescents occur in up to 72% of cases. It has been hypothesized that anatomical variations in drainage pathways contribute to the susceptibility to frontal osteomyelitis. Ocular manifestations, including periorbital inflammation, are also observed. An intriguing case report documents upper lid ectropion as the sole presentation of frontal osteomyelitis.

In our patient, there were no constitutional symptoms or rhinorrhea. There were no concomitant infections noted, nor were there identifiable infections in the ear, nose, or throat. The sole presenting feature was non-resolving preseptal swelling with a small extension over the forehead.
