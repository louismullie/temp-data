## Question

Work up for lower extremity neuropathy

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the workup for lower extremity neuropathy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the initial clinical assessment and how to classify the neuropathy pattern. Then, I should verify the core laboratory screening and when to expand it. Next, I will consider electrodiagnostic testing indications and alternatives for small-fiber disease. After that, I need to check vascular assessment and foot risk stratification, especially in diabetes. Finally, I will integrate special scenarios, follow-up, and a concise algorithm, making sure each step aligns with guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the foundation: a careful history and neurologic examination are essential to localize the problem to the peripheral nervous system and classify the pattern as symmetric distal, focal/multifocal, or radiculoplexus, because this drives the entire workup and differential diagnosis [^c8916bd4] [^38a0bc3d]. I should document symptoms, distribution, tempo, pain quality, autonomic features, medication and toxin exposures, alcohol use, family history, and comorbidities such as diabetes, thyroid disease, renal disease, and autoimmune conditions, since these shape pretest probabilities and test selection [^c8916bd4] [^d3d7f6bb].

> Wait, let me verify the bedside sensory testing strategy in diabetes, because missing loss of protective sensation changes foot risk. I should use a 10-g monofilament at standard plantar sites and add vibration with a 128-Hz tuning fork, pinprick, and temperature to screen large and small fibers, and I should document reflexes, especially Achilles, since loss correlates with neuropathy severity and fall risk [^aa6f2558] [^d044c5c4] [^9a31ed3f]. Hold on, I should also remember that in patients with diabetes, annual monofilament testing is recommended to identify feet at risk for ulceration and amputation, and I should pair this with a foot exam at every visit if there is sensory loss or prior ulcer/amputation [^16d6f090] [^e0e83bec].

> Next, I should review the core laboratory screen for distal symmetric polyneuropathy. I need to check fasting glucose or HbA1c, vitamin B12 with methylmalonic acid if low, TSH, and a CBC and CMP to assess for metabolic, endocrine, hematologic, and hepatic contributors, and I should add serum protein electrophoresis with immunofixation to screen for monoclonal gammopathies, which are not rare and can be treatable causes of neuropathy [^c8916bd4] [^dd464cf9]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; if the initial labs are unrevealing and symptoms persist, I should escalate to targeted testing rather than ordering broad panels indiscriminately [^c8916bd4].

> I will now examine when to order electrodiagnostic studies. I should confirm that EMG/NCS are not routine for all patients; they are indicated when the presentation is atypical, asymmetric, rapidly progressive, predominantly motor or autonomic, or when the initial workup is negative yet symptoms persist, because EDX can distinguish axonal from demyelinating processes and uncover alternative diagnoses such as radiculopathy or entrapment [^38a0bc3d] [^31c446fa]. But wait, what if I suspect small-fiber neuropathy? In that case, I should consider skin biopsy for intraepidermal nerve fiber density, which can detect small-fiber involvement when conventional NCS are normal, and I should remember that bilateral lower-extremity NCS may be redundant in symmetric DSP, so unilateral studies often suffice unless asymmetry is suspected [^815a7d1d] [^8dd46fe5].

> Let me consider vascular assessment carefully, because neuropathy plus ischemia is a recipe for ulceration and amputation. I should palpate posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis pulses, and if there is any doubt or risk factor, obtain an ankle-brachial index, recognizing that calcified vessels in diabetes can yield falsely elevated ABIs; in that scenario, toe pressures or TcPO2 can help, and I should refer for vascular evaluation if ABI is less than 0.9 or if there is critical limb-threatening ischemia features [^04332dff] [^9a31ed3f]. I need to ensure I also screen for autonomic neuropathy signs such as dry skin, temperature asymmetry, and abnormal sweating, and I should document foot deformities, calluses, and footwear issues that increase pressure and ulcer risk [^12b62b30] [^d044c5c4].

> Hold on, I should verify special scenarios that modify the workup. If there is a history of cancer or B-cell dyscrasia, I should consider paraneoplastic or MGUS-related neuropathies and add anti-MAG, ganglioside antibodies, and consider nerve biopsy with concurrent muscle biopsy when vasculitis is suspected, as combined biopsy increases yield in PAN and other vasculitides [^478ce031] [^4126df99]. If there is a family history or demyelinating features, I should consider hereditary neuropathies and, when phenotype and EDX suggest it, pursue targeted genetic testing rather than broad panels, to maximize yield and cost-effectiveness [^b45a0910]. If there is a warm, swollen, red foot without ulcer, I should urgently evaluate for Charcot neuroarthropathy with X-rays and total non-weight-bearing, because delays worsen deformity and outcomes [^da2140a4].

> I should double-check the follow-up cadence and safety counseling. For patients with diabetes, annual neuropathy screening is standard, with more frequent checks if there is established neuropathy or prior ulcer/amputation, and I must counsel on daily foot inspection, moisture control, and prompt reporting of new lesions; in older adults with neuropathy, I should minimize fall risk by reviewing medications, prescribing strength and balance training, and arranging podiatry for nail and pressure management [^e0e83bec] [^430ceaac]. Let me reconsider pain control and function; while treating the cause, I can use gabapentinoids, SNRIs, or TCAs for neuropathic pain and coordinate PT/OT to preserve mobility and independence, especially when gait or balance is impaired [^c8916bd4].

> Next, I should review a concise, stepwise algorithm to ensure nothing is missed. Start with history and exam to confirm peripheral neuropathy and classify the pattern; if symmetric distal, obtain core labs including glucose, B12, TSH, CBC/CMP, and SPEP with immunofixation; if asymmetric, motor-predominant, rapidly progressive, or refractory, proceed to EMG/NCS; if small-fiber symptoms predominate with normal NCS, consider skin biopsy; throughout, assess vascular status and foot risk, and escalate to targeted testing or biopsy when indicated by red flags or atypical features [^c8916bd4] [^38a0bc3d] [^815a7d1d] [^04332dff]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost said to order ANA and ESR for everyone; I should correct that and only add autoimmune serologies when the clinical picture suggests inflammatory or vasculitic etiologies, to avoid low-yield testing [^c8916bd4].

> Finally, I need to ensure documentation meets quality standards. I should record neuropathic symptoms and signs at the initial evaluation and, when DSP is diagnosed, ensure electrodiagnostic studies are obtained within 6 months if indicated, because these are paired quality measures that reflect best practice and improve diagnostic clarity and care coordination [^9a09d063]. Hold on, I should verify that I also capture functional impact, pain interference, and falls risk at each visit, as these drive referrals and safety interventions and are emphasized in quality metrics for DSP care [^dddc9eb5].

The workup for lower extremity neuropathy should be **stepwise and targeted**, starting with a focused history and neurologic exam to define the pattern and severity [^c8916bd4]. Initial labs should include CBC, CMP, fasting glucose or HbA1c, TSH, and vitamin B12; add SPEP with immunofixation if there is suspicion of monoclonal gammopathy [^c8916bd4] [^dd464cf9]. Electrodiagnostic testing (NCS/EMG) is indicated for **atypical, asymmetric, rapidly progressive, or severe cases** to distinguish axonal from demyelinating neuropathies and to identify entrapment or radiculopathy [^38a0bc3d] [^31c446fa]. Consider MRI or ultrasound for suspected entrapment or mass lesions, and use skin biopsy for small-fiber neuropathy when NCS are normal [^2efa170b] [^815a7d1d]. Evaluate for diabetes, alcohol, medications, and hereditary causes as indicated, and refer to neurology or pain specialists for complex or refractory cases [^c8916bd4] [^bc7278e3].

---

## Clinical history and physical examination

A thorough clinical history and physical examination are essential to characterize the neuropathy and guide further testing [^c8916bd4]. Key elements include:

- **Symptom onset and progression**: Acute, subacute, or chronic; symmetric or asymmetric; distal or proximal involvement [^c8916bd4].
- **Sensory symptoms**: Numbness, tingling, burning, allodynia, hyperalgesia, loss of protective sensation [^286e8a3c].
- **Motor symptoms**: Weakness, atrophy, gait instability, falls [^d94e2ccb].
- **Autonomic symptoms**: Orthostatic intolerance, gastrointestinal dysmotility, erectile dysfunction, sweating abnormalities [^286e8a3c].
- **Risk factors**: Diabetes, alcohol use, medication exposure (e.g. chemotherapy, metronidazole), family history, occupational exposures [^c8916bd4].

The physical examination should include:

- **Sensory testing**: Pinprick, light touch, vibration (128-Hz tuning fork), proprioception, temperature [^aa6f2558].
- **Motor testing**: Strength testing of major muscle groups, assessment of muscle bulk and tone [^c8916bd4].
- **Reflexes**: Deep tendon reflexes, particularly Achilles reflex [^d044c5c4].
- **Autonomic testing**: Blood pressure and heart rate response to positional changes, skin inspection for dryness or fissuring [^notfound].

---

## Initial laboratory evaluation

Basic laboratory tests are recommended to identify common, treatable causes of neuropathy [^c8916bd4]:

| **Test** | **Indication** |
|-|-|
| Complete blood count (CBC) | Anemia, hematologic disorders |
| Comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) | Renal, hepatic dysfunction, electrolyte abnormalities |
| Fasting glucose or HbA1c | Diabetes mellitus, impaired glucose tolerance |
| Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) | Hypothyroidism |
| Vitamin B12 | Deficiency neuropathy |
| Serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) with immunofixation | Monoclonal gammopathies, amyloidosis |

---

Additional tests may be considered based on clinical suspicion, including **Lyme serology, HIV testing, hepatitis C, autoimmune panels, and genetic testing** for hereditary neuropathies [^c8916bd4] [^b45a0910].

---

## Electrodiagnostic studies

Electrodiagnostic studies (nerve conduction studies [NCS] and electromyography [EMG]) are indicated in the following scenarios:

- **Atypical presentations**: Asymmetric, predominantly motor, or rapidly progressive neuropathies [^38a0bc3d].
- **Uncertainty of diagnosis**: Differentiate axonal from demyelinating neuropathies, identify entrapment neuropathies, radiculopathies, or plexopathies [^617ed73b].
- **Severity assessment**: Establish baseline severity for prognosis and treatment monitoring [^notfound].

NCS/EMG can identify **axonal degeneration, demyelination, conduction block, and focal entrapments**, guiding further management [^617ed73b].

---

## Imaging studies

Imaging is reserved for specific clinical scenarios:

- **Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)**: Suspected nerve entrapment, compressive lesions, tumors, or spinal cord/pathology [^2efa170b].
- **Ultrasound**: Evaluation of nerve entrapment, dynamic assessment of nerves, guidance for interventions [^aafdedc4].

---

## Specialized tests

Specialized tests may be indicated for specific neuropathy subtypes:

- **Skin biopsy**: Small-fiber neuropathy, particularly when NCS are normal [^815a7d1d].
- **Autonomic testing**: Quantitative sudomotor axon reflex test (QSART), cardiovascular autonomic testing [^notfound].
- **Nerve biopsy**: Suspected vasculitis, amyloidosis, or infiltrative neuropathies [^4126df99].

---

## Multidisciplinary approach

A multidisciplinary approach involving **neurologists, endocrinologists, pain specialists, physical therapists, and podiatrists** is essential for comprehensive care, particularly in complex cases such as diabetic neuropathy or chronic pain syndromes [^bc7278e3].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Regular follow-up is essential to monitor disease progression, assess treatment response, and adjust management strategies. Annual **neuropathy screening** is recommended for patients with diabetes or other chronic conditions predisposing to neuropathy [^e0e83bec].

---

The workup for lower extremity neuropathy should be **systematic and individualized**, integrating clinical evaluation, laboratory testing, electrodiagnostic studies, and imaging when indicated. This approach ensures accurate diagnosis, identifies treatable causes, and guides appropriate management strategies.

### Approach to peripheral neuropathy for the primary care clinician [^e490ecbc]. The American Journal of Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Peripheral neuropathy is commonly encountered in the primary care setting and is associated with significant morbidity, including neuropathic pain, falls, and disability. The clinical presentation of neuropathy is diverse, with possible symptoms including weakness, sensory abnormalities, and autonomic dysfunction. Accordingly, the primary care clinician must be comfortable using the neurologic examination-including the assessment of motor function, multiple sensory modalities, and deep tendon reflexes-to recognize and characterize neuropathy. Although the causes of peripheral neuropathy are numerous and diverse, careful review of the medical and family history coupled with limited, select laboratory testing can often efficiently lead to an etiologic diagnosis. This review offers an approach for evaluating suspected neuropathy in the primary care setting. It will describe the most common causes, suggest an evidence-based workup to aid in diagnosis, and highlight recent evidence that allows for selection of symptomatic treatment of patients with neuropathy.

### Peripheral neuropathy: evaluation and differential diagnosis [^c8916bd4]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Peripheral neuropathy, a common neurologic problem encountered by family physicians, can be classified clinically by the anatomic pattern of presenting symptoms and, if indicated, by results of electrodiagnostic studies for axonal and demyelinating disease. The prevalence of peripheral neuropathy in the general population ranges from 1% to 7%, with higher rates among those older than 50 years. Common identifiable causes include diabetes mellitus, nerve compression or injury, alcohol use, toxin exposure, hereditary diseases, and nutritional deficiencies. Peripheral neuropathy is idiopathic in 25% to 46% of cases. Diagnosis requires a comprehensive history, physical examination, and judicious laboratory testing. Early peripheral neuropathy may present as sensory alterations that are often progressive, including sensory loss, numbness, pain, or burning sensations in a "stocking and glove" distribution of the extremities. Later stages may involve proximal numbness, distal weakness, or atrophy. Physical examination should include a comprehensive neurologic and musculoskeletal evaluation. If the peripheral nervous system is identified as the likely source of the patient's symptoms, evaluation for potential underlying etiologies should initially focus on treatable causes. Initial laboratory evaluation includes a complete blood count; a comprehensive metabolic profile; fasting blood glucose, vitamin B12, and thyroid-stimulating hormone levels; and serum protein electrophoresis with immunofixation. If the initial evaluation is inconclusive, referral to a neurologist for additional testing (e.g., electrodiagnostic studies, specific antibody assays, nerve biopsy) should be considered. Treatment of peripheral neuropathy focuses on managing the underlying etiology. Several classes of medications, including gabapentinoids and antidepressants, can help alleviate neuropathic pain.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for lower extremity amputation, more specifically with respect to risk assessment, ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to obtain a comprehensive foot evaluation in patients with diabetes at least annually to identify risk factors for ulcers and amputations. Perform foot inspection at every visit in patients with evidence of sensory loss or a history of ulceration or amputation.
Obtain annual 10-g monofilament testing in all patients with diabetes to identify feet at risk for ulceration and amputation.

### Neuropathy: mobility and quality of life [^d94e2ccb]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

In summary, diabetes is increasingly becoming a disease of elderly people. Some of the under-appreciated complications such as impaired physical functioning, increased risk for falls and fractures need to be more addressed in the future. When evaluating a patient with peripheral neuropathy, it is also important to pay attention to the possibility of deficits in postural stability and lower extremity functioning. Impairments in lower extremity physical functioning are key contributors to loss of physical independence and have a major impact on quality of life. Increasing awareness of disability as a potentially modifiable complication should become a health priority for people with diabetes. Early results of interventions to improve physical functioning are promising and need to be further explored within clinical practice.

### Peripheral neuropathy: evaluation and differential diagnosis… [^286e8a3c]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

Early peripheral neuropathy may present as sensory alterations that are often progressive, including sensory loss, numbness, pain, or burning sensations in a "stocking and glove" distribution of the extremities. 3 Later stages may involve proximal numbness, distal weakness, or atrophy. 3 One-third of patients with peripheral neuropathy have neuropathic pain. 1 Other common presenting symptoms include a stabbing or electric shock sensation, allodynia, hyperalgesia, and hyperesthesia. 1, 4, 13, 14 Patients may also report autonomic symptoms such as orthostatic intolerance, gastroparesis, changes in bowel and bladder function, erectile dysfunction, and blurry vision, or vasomotor symptoms such as dryness of the eyes, mouth, or skin, and burning or flushing.

Physical Examination The physical examination should include a comprehensive neurologic examination, testing of the cranial nerves, fundoscopy, assessment for muscle fasciculations, and evaluation of muscle bulk and tone. Nerve compression or injury from trauma or medical procedures should be considered. Common areas of compression include the sciatic nerve, fibular nerve, and femoral cutaneous nerve. 3 Common compression peripheral neuropathies include carpal tunnel syndrome, cubital tunnel syndrome, and radiculopathy from spinal degeneration.

1. 1, 22 Studies also show that electrodiagnostic tests have low utility as part of initial workup. 1, 23 Given these findings, electrodiagnostic studies are not routinely indicated. However, patients should be referred for electrodiagnostic studies if symptoms are worrisome or if initial workup is normal and symptoms persist. 1, 20, 22 If demyelinating conditions are suspected, electrodiagnostic studies can be confirmatory. Normal findings on electrodiagnostic studies significantly decrease the likelihood of peripheral neuropathy but are more accurate in the larger, axonal fibers. Treatment of the suspected diagnosis should be initiated while electrodiagnostic studies are pending so that care is not delayed. Principles of Treatment Treatment of peripheral neuropathy focuses on managing the underlying condition. In addition, treatment of the associated symptoms can significantly improve the patient's quality of life. Nonpharmacologic strategies such as proper foot hygiene, wearing appropriate footwear, weight loss, and physical therapy and gait training can help improve symptoms in those with lower extremity peripheral neuropathy.

### Home-based physical activity intervention for taxane-induced CIPN… [^038e5b25]. ClinicalTrials (2020). Medium credibility.

Home-Based Physical Activity Intervention for Taxane-Induced CIPN ClinicalTrials. gov ID. Study Overview This two-group, randomized control trial will test the effects of a home-based, 16 week gait/balance training plus resistance exercise program as compared to an educational cancer survivorship attention control condition to address persistent taxane-induced peripheral neuropathy in 312 patients treated for invasive breast cancer with taxanes at 1 year or more after completion of therapy. Assessments of lower extremity muscle strength, gait/balance, nerve conduction, neuropathy symptoms, and quality of life will be performed. The proposed exercise intervention addresses gait/balance impairments and motor components of taxane-induced peripheral neuropathy.

The mechanism by which the intervention achieves the proposed outcomes is though 1) increasing endoneurial blood flow to peripheral nerves and mitochondria resulting in reduction in neuropathic symptoms and clinical manifestations of peripheral neuropathy, while improving gait/balance in those with persistent neuropathy; 2) The subsequent increase in nutrient supply allows the mitochondria to function more efficiently, and may alleviate the neuropathic manifestations of taxane-induced peripheral neuropathy.

### Clinical utility of electrodiagnostic consultation in suspected polyneuropathy [^31c446fa]. Muscle & Nerve (2004). Low credibility.

Although paresthesias of the distal lower limbs are characteristic features of polyneuropathy, they may also herald the presence of a focal neuropathy, polyradiculopathy, or myelopathy. Electromyography and nerve conduction studies (EMG/NCS) are widely used in the evaluation of such symptoms, but their utility has not been subjected to vigorous scrutiny. We investigated the clinical impact of the electrodiagnostic consultation in assessing suspected polyneuropathy. When compared with the clinical impression, the result of the electrodiagnostic consultation was confirmatory in only 39% of all patients, and changed the diagnosis or uncovered an additional diagnosis in 43%. An alternative diagnosis was likely when either weakness was present (75%) or the Achilles stretch reflex was preserved (48%). These data support the use of EMG/NCS in the diagnostic evaluation of patients presenting with distal paresthesias, especially in those with preserved Achilles reflexes or motor deficits.

### Deconstructing chronic low back pain in the older adult-step by step evidence and expert-based recommendations for evaluation and treatment. part VIII: lateral hip and thigh pain [^cfa1e6e9]. Pain Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Physical examination supportive of lumbar radicular pain involves provocation of pain with isolated movements of the lumbar spine elements, especially the lumbar nerve roots. As an initial screen for lumbar radicular pain, the examiner should ask the patient to perform active lumbar flexion, extension, side-bending, and lateral rotation from a standing position to evaluate whether any of these movements reproduce and/or exacerbate the patient's lateral hip/thigh pain. For a more specific test, the seated slump test is designed to put selective tension on the lumbar nerve roots. To perform this maneuver, while seated the patient is instructed to slump into cervical, thoracic, and lumbar flexion. The examiner then extends the knee and dorsiflexes the ankle of the affected leg to the patient's end range of motion (see Figure 4). Of note, older adults often have stiff joints and muscle contractures which limit their passive range of motion, but the test can still be performed effectively. The test is positive if the patient's typical pain is reproduced with this maneuver and is subsequently relieved with neck extension. Neck extension should result in less tension on the nerve roots but does not affect lumbar vertebral position or lower extremity muscle length, so if the patient's pain does not abate with neck extension, the pain may be due to myofascial low back pain or lower extremity muscle tightness rather than nerve irritation.

### Diagnosis and risk assessment of lower extremity peripheral arterial disease [^951a0dcc]. Journal of Endovascular Therapy (2006). Low credibility.

Managing patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) requires an accurate assessment of the severity of the condition and the risk factors likely to predict disease progression. The spectrum of patient presentation ranges from asymptomatic to critical limb ischemia. Because about half of patients with PAD have coronary or cerebrovascular disease, the examination of presenting patients should be directed toward the entire cardiovascular system. The main diagnostic goal is to establish whether the symptoms are predominantly caused by PAD and to what degree the presenting problem is compounded by other comorbidities, such as diabetic neuropathy, arthritis, or venous disorders. The diagnostic process includes history taking, physical examination, noninvasive diagnostic testing, differential diagnosis, laboratory studies, and the use of the various imaging modalities, which in general are reserved for those PAD cases in which the clinician has already decided to intervene.

### Evaluation of distal symmetric polyneuropathy: the role of autonomic testing, nerve biopsy, and skin biopsy (an evidence-based review) [^815a7d1d]. Muscle & Nerve (2009). Medium credibility.

Appendix 2 — classification of evidence for studies of diagnostic accuracy — defines Class I as a prospective study in a broad spectrum of persons with the suspected condition using a "gold standard" case definition where a test is applied in a blinded evaluation and enabling assessment of appropriate tests of diagnostic accuracy; Class II as either a prospective study with a narrow spectrum of persons with the suspected condition or a well‑designed retrospective study of a broad spectrum of persons with an established condition compared to a broad spectrum of controls, with blinded testing enabling assessment of diagnostic accuracy; Class III as a retrospective study where either persons with the established condition or controls are of a narrow spectrum, with a test applied in a blinded evaluation; and Class IV as any design where a test is not applied in blinded evaluation or evidence provided by expert opinion alone or descriptive case series.

### Challenges in the treatment of chronic wounds [^83f51a19]. Advances in Wound Care (2015). Low credibility.

Depth, extent (size), location, general appearance, odor, and notation of exudates are all essential components of wound evaluation and need to be recorded at baseline. Probing the wound will determine its depth of penetration and any tracking along tendon sheaths or tissue planes. A positive probe-to-bone (PTB) test has a high predictive value for underlying osteomyelitis even in the absence of acute signs of deep infection (Fig. 2C). A neurological evaluation should be performed to assess the presence and extent of neuropathy since this factor not only predisposes a patient to DFUs but is also a major risk factor for diabetes-related lower extremity amputation.

A vascular examination is important for any type of chronic wound, but assessment of arterial perfusion is especially important for DFU patients since this parameter will drive all subsequent therapies and outcomes. Palpation of pulses commences initially, recognizing that this assessment can be highly variable among different clinicians. Medial arterial calcification renders pulse palpation to be difficult even in the presence of adequate perfusion to the foot. Nonetheless, ankle–brachial indices (ABI) should be obtained at baseline for most patients for whom there is any question of a pulse deficit. Despite the falsely elevated ABI levels that medial arterial calcification produces, the American Diabetes Association has recommended that this diagnostic test be performed on diabetic patients over 50 years of age and whenever clinical circumstances (such as in the case of DFU) dictate this evaluation. Regardless, when the ABI is below 0.9, the patient should be considered to have impaired arterial perfusion. To augment ankle–brachial studies, toe blood pressure readings, pulse volume recordings, transcutaneous oxygen measurements, and skin perfusion pressure measurements have been recommended as valid benchmarks for the prediction of wound healing. Whenever peripheral arterial disease is suspected or confirmed by the noninvasive tests above, a referral to a vascular surgeon or interventionist is indicated for angiography and revascularization. Limb salvage rates have been reported as high as 80% for ischemic foot ulcers undergoing revascularization.

### Quality improvement in neurology: distal symmetric polyneuropathy quality measures [^9a09d063]. Neurology (2014). Medium credibility.

American Academy of Neurology distal symmetric polyneuropathy (DSP) quality measures — diagnostic criteria — include paired measures for initial evaluation and confirmatory testing. Measure 1 specifies the percentage of patients age 18 years and older with a diagnosis of DSP who had neuropathic symptoms and signs reviewed and documented at the initial evaluation for DSP, with neuropathic symptoms and signs defined on-page, and Measure 2 specifies the percentage of patients age 18 years and older with a diagnosis of DSP who had electrodiagnostic studies conducted, documented, and reviewed within 6 months of initial evaluation; the two measures are explicitly paired with each other.

### 2024 ACC / AHA / AACVPR / APMA / ABC / SCAI / SVM / SVN / SVS / SIR / VESS guideline for the management of lower extremity peripheral artery disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^04332dff]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Peripheral artery disease (PAD) — supportive clinical assessment guidance states that patients at risk for PAD are identified based on demographic features, cardiovascular risk factors, or atherosclerotic disease in other vascular beds, and that Black race is associated with increased risk for PAD and with MACE and MALE. Symptom presentation varies, with it estimated that only one-third of patients present with typical claudication, and all patients with chronic symptomatic PAD have walking impairment. Patients at increased risk of PAD require a thorough vascular examination focused on the lower extremities; to accomplish this, all lower extremity garments, including shoes and socks, should be removed. Pulses are palpated and rated as follows: 0, absent; 1, diminished; 2, normal; or 3, bounding, and presence of all 4 (right and left) posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis pulses on palpation is associated with low likelihood of PAD; evaluating for both abdominal and femoral bruits may also be useful, and additional evaluation for peripheral neuropathy should be considered among patients with diabetes.

### Entrapment neuropathy about the foot and ankle: an update [^d3819663]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2015). Low credibility.

Occurrences of entrapment neuropathies of the lower extremity are relatively infrequent; therefore, these conditions may be underappreciated and difficult to diagnose. Understanding the anatomy of the peripheral nerves and their potential entrapment sites is essential. A detailed physical examination and judicious use of imaging modalities are also vital when establishing a diagnosis. Once an accurate diagnosis is obtained, treatment is aimed at reducing external pressure, minimizing inflammation, correcting any causative foot and ankle deformities, and ultimately releasing any constrictive tissues.

### Comprehensive foot examination and risk assessment: a report of the task force of the foot care interest group of the American diabetes association, with endorsement by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists [^08bbf5ad]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

It cannot be overstated that the complications of the diabetic foot are common, complex, and costly, mandating aggressive and proactive preventative assessments by generalists and specialists. All patients with diabetes must have their feet evaluated at least at yearly intervals for the presence of the predisposing factors for ulceration and amputation (neuropathy, vascular disease, and deformities). This report summarizes a simple protocol for doing so. If abnormalities are present, more frequent evaluation of the diabetic foot is recommended depending on risk category, as described above and in Table 4. It is through systematic examination and risk assessment, patient education, and timely referral that we may further reduce the unnecessarily high prevalence of lower-extremity morbidity in this population.

### Global vascular guidelines on the management of chronic limb-threatening ischemia [^be324ccf]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) — conceptual framework, nomenclature, and staging — This clinical practice guideline (CPC) intentionally seeks to create a new conceptual framework for the treatment of CLTI. It encompasses nomenclature, disease staging, and a platform for evidence-based revascularization (EBR) that will allow future evaluation and quality improvement in the field. Consistent and meaningful nomenclature is of fundamental importance for assessing the state of evidence and guiding future research efforts, and the GVG promotes the use of the term CLTI, defined by the target population, to denote the universe of patients with advanced lower limb ischemia, wounds, neuropathy, and infection who are commonly referred to vascular specialists for evaluation and management. Prior terms such as "critical" and "severe" limb ischemia connote specific hemodynamic thresholds and fail to recognize the full spectrum and inter-relatedness of components beyond ischemia that contribute to major limb amputation and long-term disability. Improved disease staging is mandatory for designing clinical trials, conducting comparative effectiveness research, identifying critical gaps in knowledge, and developing effective algorithms for treatment, and the GVG incorporates the SVS Lower Extremity Threatened Limb Classification System as a preferred staging system for CLTI.

### Bilateral nerve conduction studies in the evaluation of distal symmetric polyneuropathy [^8dd46fe5]. Muscle & Nerve (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Nerve conduction studies are used to aid in the diagnosis of distal symmetric polyneuropathy (DSP). It is unclear whether bilateral lower extremity nerve conduction studies (NCS) are needed when evaluating for suspected DSP.

Methods

We retrospectively analyzed NCS from patients who presented to the University of Michigan electromyography laboratory between July 1, 2016 and December 31, 2017 with symptoms of DSP to assess agreement and correlation between left and right lower extremity NCS parameters.

Results

We found significant agreement between abnormalities in individual nerve parameters of the left and right lower extremities of 105 patients, most notably in the sural nerve. In the 53 patients with bilateral sural, peroneal, and tibial studies, there was also significant agreement between whether the left and right met electrodiagnostic criteria for DSP (κ = 0.77).

Discussion

Bilateral lower extremity NCS may have limited utility in the evaluation of suspected DSP. Muscle Nerve, 2019.

### Bexagliflozin (Brenzavvy) [^bb8742af]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Consider ketone monitoring in patients at risk for ketoacidosis if indicated by the clinical situation. Assess for ketoacidosis regardless of presenting blood glucose levels in patients who present with signs and symptoms consistent with severe metabolic acidosis. If ketoacidosis is suspected, discontinue BRENZAVVY, promptly evaluate, and treat ketoacidosis, if confirmed. Monitor patients for resolution of ketoacidosis before restarting BRENZAVVY.

Withhold BRENZAVVY, if possible, in temporary clinical situations that could predispose patients to ketoacidosis. Resume BRENZAVVY when the patient is clinically stable and has resumed oral intake [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

Educate all patients on the signs and symptoms of ketoacidosis and instruct patients to discontinue BRENZAVVY and seek medical attention immediately if signs and symptoms occur.

5.2 Lower Limb Amputation

An increased incidence of lower limb amputations occurred in BRENZAVVY-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients (8.3 versus 5.1 events per 1,000 patient-years) in a randomized, placebo-controlled trial evaluating patients with type 2 diabetes who had either established cardiovascular disease (CVD) or were at risk for CVD (Trial 6). Additional amputation data from Trial 6 are shown in Table 2 [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Of the 23 BRENZAVVY-treated patients who had amputations, 15 were amputations of the toe and midfoot and 8 were amputations above and below the knee. Some patients had multiple amputations.

Lower limb infections, gangrene, ischemia, and osteomyelitis were the most common precipitating medical events leading to the need for an amputation. The risk of amputation was highest in patients with a baseline history of prior amputation, peripheral vascular disease, and neuropathy.

Before initiating BRENZAVVY, consider factors in the patient history that may predispose to the need for amputations, such as a history of prior amputation, peripheral vascular disease, neuropathy and diabetic foot ulcers. Counsel patients about the importance of routine preventative foot care. Monitor patients receiving BRENZAVVY for signs and symptoms of infection (including osteomyelitis), new pain or tenderness, sores or ulcers involving the lower limbs, and discontinue BRENZAVVY if these complications occur.

Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) and functional consequences — prevalence, prevention, and adverse outcomes: DPN is a common complication of both type 1 and 2 diabetes and may cause impaired postural balance and gait kinematics, leading to functional disability; DPN can be found in up to half of people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, resulting in physical disability, and neuropathic pain, resulting in a diminished quality of life. Glycemic management prevents DPN development in type 1 diabetes; in contrast, glycemic management has modest or no benefit in type 2 diabetes. People with lower-extremity involvement due to DPN have 3 times more risk of restricted mobility, and DPN may progress to traumatic lower-limb amputation, which significantly impacts quality of life.

### Clinical reasoning: progressive peripheral neuropathy in a 66-year-old woman with sezary syndrome [^00007eb9]. Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Evaluating patients with neuropathy is common, especially in elderly patients with comorbidities. Neuropathy can often be a manifestation of systemic diseases, cancer, or drug-induced toxicity; thus, the differential diagnosis is challenging. The mechanism of nerve damage can vary significantly, affecting the patient's therapeutic management. We describe a 66-year-old woman who presented with subacute and progressively worsening motor weakness of the lower extremities with bilateral numbness and tingling after a recent respiratory tract infection. Her medical history included diabetes mellitus and Sezary syndrome in the context of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. This case emphasizes the significance of a detailed evaluation and considering clinical signs and electrophysiologic findings in patients with neuropathy and a history of hematologic malignancy. Early recognition and management can be crucial in shaping the clinical course of the disease.

### Magnetic resonance neurography: improved diagnosis of peripheral neuropathies [^617ed73b]. Neurotherapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

Conventional Diagnostics: Gold Standard with Limitations

Traditionally, the diagnostic work-up in patients with a suspected peripheral neuropathy includes a thorough past medical history including family and occupational history, followed by a detailed physical neurologic examination. Electrophysiologic examinations represent the current diagnostic gold standard in peripheral neuropathies and commonly assess nerve conduction velocities (NCV), distal motor latencies (DML), compound muscle action potentials (CMAP), F-waves, and sensory nerve action potentials (SNAP) of upper and/or lower extremity peripheral nerves. Needle electromyography, a test that evaluates and records the electric activity produced by a skeletal muscle, may help to diagnose neuromuscular disorders, especially when muscle or motor neuron function or the signal transmission from nerve to muscle is impaired. Results from these diagnostic tests often allow for the differentiation between acute and chronic, focal and non-focal, or axonal and demyelinating neuropathies. However, major limitations of conventional diagnostic testing include the inability to accurately determine the exact anatomical lesion localization, lesion extension, and spatial lesion dispersion, factors that are all crucial for determining a correct diagnosis and selecting the appropriate therapeutic strategy. This is especially true for lesions that affect the proximal levels of the PNS, such as the sciatic nerve, the lumbosacral plexus or the spinal nerves and nerve roots that are hardly amenable to standard nerve conduction studies (NCS). Consequently, proximal nerve injury or an additional, sometimes subclinical, involvement of proximal nerves may remain undetected. Another typical limitation of conventional diagnostics lays in the lack of differentiation between distal nerve lesions that affect the complete nerve cross-section and a more proximally located nerve lesion that selectively affects single fascicles within a peripheral nerve. This can be explained by the internal somatotopic organization of nerve fibers within a peripheral nerve, similar to the somatotopic organization of motor and sensory tracts in the CNS. Single nerve fibers are grouped together in fascicles that are clustered together within the length of a peripheral nerve trunk and are destined to become a certain nerve branch somewhere along the distal course of the nerve. These clustered fascicles within a proximal nerve trunk carry the identical information and function as their respective distal nerve branch, e.g. the innervation of a certain target muscle. Therewith, proximal fascicular nerve lesions can lead to the exact same clinical and electrophysiologic presentation as a more distally located nerve lesion that involves the whole nerve cross-section. A common result of this kind of misdiagnosis is a surgical decompression therapy performed in a suspected focal distal entrapment neuropathy, even though the underlying nerve lesion is more proximally located, or the lesion distribution is diffuse or multifocal and not monofocal, requiring systemic rather than surgical treatment. Finally, nerve lesions not (yet) resulting in an overt motor or sensory deficit may just be missed by the clinical and electrophysiologic tests.

Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Peripheral artery disease — vascular examination approach and pulse grading: Patients at increased risk of PAD require a thorough vascular examination with a focus on the lower extremities, and all lower extremity garments, including shoes and socks, should be removed. Lower extremity pulses are evaluated with palpation and rated as follows: 0; absent; 1, diminished; 2, normal; or 3, bounding. Presence of all 4 (right and left) posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis pulses on palpation is associated with low likelihood of PAD, evaluating for both abdominal and femoral bruits may also be useful, and additional evaluation for peripheral neuropathy should be considered among patients with diabetes.

Entrapment neuropathies of the lower extremity are commonly encountered and present a diagnostic challenge. Historical diagnostic workhorses-the physical examination combined with electrodiagnostic studies-are now frequently supplemented by MR neurography. MR neurography is a high-resolution, noninvasive, and operator-independent imaging modality that has proven useful in diagnosis, disease severity assessment, and informing treatment decisions in the management of lower extremity entrapment neuropathies. Currently, the assessment of the peripheral nerves relies heavily on reader identification of morphologic nerve changes; however, emerging innovative MR sequences and PET/MR imaging hold the potential to provide noninvasive means of functional assessment.

### A pragmatic approach to improving management and patient flow for painful diabetic neuropathy in UK primary care [^6bf1e876]. Diabetes Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy (pDPN) affects approximately 25% of individuals with diabetes in the UK and remains underdiagnosed and suboptimally managed in primary care. The condition causes chronic pain, limits daily functioning, impairs quality of life, and increases the risk of complications like foot ulcers and amputations due to underlying neuropathy. Current care pathways are fragmented, leading to delays in diagnosis and limited access to evidence-based therapies. This article aims to address the challenges of screening, diagnosis, and management of pDPN in UK primary care by proposing a consensus-driven, five-step pragmatic strategy.

Methods

An expert panel of general practitioners and a diabetes nurse practitioner from across the UK convened to review and discuss strategies for improving pDPN care. Consensus was reached through an evaluation of barriers in clinical practice, supported by real-world experience and examples of innovative care delivery models, resulting in the development of practical recommendations and workflow.

Results

Key barriers identified include insufficient training of healthcare professionals in pDPN, underutilisation of validated screening tools such as the DN4 questionnaire, and inconsistent and outdated treatment guidelines. To address these challenges, a five-step approach was proposed to include screening high-risk patients using validated questionnaires, following up on these patients to enable early diagnoses, initiating early treatments with first-line therapies while monitoring responses, referring complex cases to secondary care on the basis of structured criteria, and ensuring coordinated follow-up to streamline and optimise care delivery. Case studies demonstrate the practical application of these strategies in improving early detection, treatment adherence, and long-term care for individuals with pDPN.

Conclusion

Current practices have fallen short in providing adequate care for one in four individuals with diabetes. Implementing a straightforward five-step approach can significantly improve diagnostic accuracy and treatment outcomes, reducing the burden of pDPN on both patients and society.

Results

Among 17 patients with SARS-CoV-2 onset between February 21, 2020, and January 19, 2021, treated in 10 states/territories (Table 1), 16 had mild COVID. The one (#9) with severe COVID (1 month stay in intensive care with ventilatory support) had electrodiagnostically confirmed sensorimotor polyneuropathy ascribed to critical care illness in addition to SFN. Medical histories and comprehensive blood screening (not shown) identified none with conventional neuropathy risks nor evidence of systemic dysimmunity. Imaging of the brain or spine, if performed, was unrevealing.

Table 1
Participants, Objective Tests, and Treatments

Participants' ages averaged 43.3 ± 3.3 years on COVID D1, and 68.8% were female; 18.8% were Latino, and 94.1% were Caucasian. Diagnostic tests for neuropathy (Table 1) revealed that 16.7% electrodiagnostic studies were abnormal, whereas 62.5% (10/16) of lower leg skin biopsies pathologically confirmed SFN, as corroborated by 50% of upper thigh biopsies and autonomic function tests. Initial SFN symptom scores (Table 2) were abnormal — reduced to 40.7% of ideal on average — with pain scores averaging 4.8/10. Initial neuromuscular examinations (Table 3) averaged 77.0% of ideal, with reduced/abnormal distal pin and vibration sensations and absent Achilles reflexes most prevalent. Participants 9 and 15 had distal muscle weakness and atrophy. Some patients were initially evaluated early in the course and others later, and investigations continued for months. Sixteen participants with 2020 onset had > 1 year follow up, with the latest onset on 1/19/21. See Figure 1 (case 15) and eFigure 1, (case 13) for longitudinal details.

### Screening for diabetic peripheral neuropathy in resource-limited settings [^9845b0a9]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Diabetic neuropathy is the most common microvascular complication of diabetes mellitus and a major risk factor for diabetes-related lower-extremity complications. Diffuse neuropathy is the most frequently encountered pattern of neurological dysfunction and presents clinically as distal symmetrical sensorimotor polyneuropathy. Due to the increasing public health significance of diabetes mellitus and its complications, screening for diabetic peripheral neuropathy is essential. Consequently, a review of the principles that guide screening practices, especially in resource-limited clinical settings, is urgently needed.

Main Body

Numerous evidence-based assessments are used to detect diabetic peripheral neuropathy. In accordance with current guideline recommendations from the American Diabetes Association, International Diabetes Federation, International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot, and National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, a screening algorithm for diabetic peripheral neuropathy based on multiphasic clinical assessment, stratification according to risk of developing diabetic foot syndrome, individualized treatment, and scheduled follow-up is suggested for use in resource-limited settings.

Conclusions

Screening for diabetic peripheral neuropathy in resource-limited settings requires a practical and comprehensive approach in order to promptly identify affected individuals. The principles of screening for diabetic peripheral neuropathy are: multiphasic approach, risk stratification, individualized treatment, and scheduled follow-up. Regular screening for diabetes-related foot disease using simple clinical assessments may improve patient outcomes.

COMPONENTS OF THE FOOT EXAM

History

While history is a pivotal component of risk assessment, a patient cannot be fully assessed for risk factors for foot ulceration based on history alone; a careful foot exam remains the key component of this process. Key components of the history include previous foot ulceration or amputation. Other important assessments in the history (Table 2) include neuropathic or peripheral vascular symptoms, impaired vision, or renal replacement therapy. Lastly, tobacco use should be recorded, since cigarette smoking is a risk factor not only for vascular disease but also for neuropathy.

Results and Discussion

Early Recognition of Symptoms of Peripheral Neuropathy

PN symptoms, which may manifest during diabetes diagnosis or prediabetes, pose a challenge for early recognition due to their vague nature, often mistaken for aging or unrelated conditions. This hindrance in timely identification is compounded by individuals' frequent oversight of symptoms and the potential misinterpretation by primary care physicians. It becomes imperative to educate healthcare professionals on diverse presentations, symmetrical symptoms, and atypical neuropathic manifestations for improved diagnosis. Often, screening and diagnosis are overlooked until patients complain of PN-related symptoms, at which point the disease would have already progressed. In addition, it is crucial to provide healthcare professionals (HCP) and nurses with comprehensive education about PN symptomatology. HCPs need to be aware of other symptoms that may not be distinctly neuropathic, such as a wide array of symptoms affecting different nerve areas, alongside non-neurological problems such as diarrhea and slowed digestion. In addition, HCPs need to be aware of patients at risk of developing PN. An increasing amount of research associates prediabetes, obesity, and metabolic syndrome with the risk of developing both DPN and chronic sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy (CSPN). The impact of DPN can be severe. About 50% of individuals with diabetes will experience a foot ulcer at some point in their lives, and diabetes is a leading cause of lower limb amputations. Additionally, neuropathic pain and reduced sensation can lead to numerous adverse outcomes, such as falls, diminished quality of life, limitations in daily activities, and depressive symptoms. This highlights the substantial burden of PN.

Screening for Peripheral Neuropathy

Screening Methods

Screening methods such as the 10-g monofilament test are currently used to detect patients with advanced neuropathy. Integration of innovative screening methods, such as continuous glucose monitoring and simplified questionnaires, should be prioritized to streamline the identification process. In resource-available settings, more sophisticated diagnostic techniques can be utilized for the earlier detection of PN.

Challenges with Subjective Questionnaires

In a review conducted by Gad et al. scoring systems for PN were evaluated, emphasizing the difficulties associated with subjective questionnaires due to their time-consuming nature. Clinical questionnaires commonly used in practice, like the DN4 (Douleur Neuropathique 4), LANSS (Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic Symptoms and Signs), and NTSS-6 (Neuropathy Total Symptom Score-6), among others, exhibit restricted diagnostic precision, demand substantial time for completion, and produce varying prevalence estimates for PN due to inconsistencies in agreement on sensitivity and specificity.

### Development and consensus process for a clinical pathway for the assessment and management of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy [^72b1e028]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Management and referral

The consensus was reached on all 5 items in stage 1 (86–98% agreement). Regarding CIPN management and referral, participants agreed that symptoms resulting from CIPN, including neuropathic pain, balance impairment, and sleep disturbances, may warrant closer monitoring. Participants agreed that symptoms resulting from CIPN require further investigation or referral to other care providers. Participants agreed that patients with functional deficits should be considered for referral to allied health professionals. Participants agreed that patients should be encouraged to be physically active and that education should be provided for safety measures, including thermal management, balance, and foot care. The consensus was also achieved concerning the consideration of referral of patients with worsening or prolonged CIPN symptoms to a neurology service, although one respondent highlighted that "the subtleties of small fibre neuropathy can occur before it becomes clinically apparent, making it challenging to only rely on patients self-reporting symptom changes to trigger the longer assessments".

Feasibility of the clinical pathway

The consensus was reached on 2/3 items (67%) in stage 1 (73–86% agreement). Participants agreed that implementing the CIPN-path would improve CIPN outcomes for patients and that the proposed pathway should be adapted to each site depending on the needs of the population and the availability of resources. One item did not reach consensus in stage 1, which was that CIPN-path represented a realistic and achievable process. This item did reach consensus in stage 2 (Table 2).

A common theme reported by respondents was potential difficulties with incorporating neurology services into CIPN management, including that "timely access to neurology and NCS is a barrier at some sites", "routine neurology review may not be helpful, or be feasible, particularly in busy clinics", and that in rural areas "patients do not have access to publicly available neurologists or specialised allied health professionals". However, it was also suggested that "patients with a significant risk of developing CIPN should have pre- or early treatment baseline NCS, which can assist to guide treatment and improve the sensitivity of early CIPN diagnosis".

There was agreement from respondents on the utility of the CIPN-path, including "this pathway which includes an evidence-based approach can support delivering best practice to patients… with many pathways lacking in pre- and posttreatment steps", "having a clear pathway will help staff and patients be aware of CIPN and the ongoing problems associated with it" and that CIPN is often "poorly addressed from diagnosis, with patients feeling ill-informed with no clear management pathway".

Acute limb ischemia (ALI) — clinical presentation and initial evaluation recommendations emphasize urgency and bedside assessment: "Patients with ALI should be emergently evaluated by a clinician with sufficient experience to assess limb viability and implement appropriate therapy", and "In patients with suspected ALI, initial clinical evaluation should rapidly assess limb viability and potential for salvage and does not require imaging (357–361)". The text adds, "ALI is a medical emergency and must be recognized rapidly. The time constraint is due to the period that skeletal muscle will tolerate ischemia — roughly 4 to 6 hours (362)", and specifies, "The bedside assessment should include arterial and venous examination with a handheld continuous-wave Doppler because of the inaccuracy of pulse palpation (34)". Doppler findings stratify severity: "The loss of doppler arterial signal indicates that the limb is threatened" and "The absence of both arterial and venous Doppler signal indicates that the limb may be irreversibly damaged (nonsalvageable)". Additionally, "Even in the setting of rapid and effective revascularization, the 1-year morbidity and mortality rates associated with ALI are high (360,363)".

Second, it remains unclear which patient characteristics contribute to a better outcome after decompression surgery. Liao et al. proposed that the presence of focal pain or pain induced by mechanical stimuli are both predictors of a successful surgical outcome, although only 39% of included studies used pain as a selection criterion or distinguished between focal or diffuse pain. With regard to severity of nerve compression, 4 studies propose that an early stage of nerve injury (eg, a 2PD < 20 mm) is associated with better pain relief after external neurolysis. Three studies found a positive Tinel sign, which is suggested to be associated with a relatively early stage of nerve injury and is the most commonly used selection criterion, to predict pain relief after LEND surgery. In contrast, Biddinger and Amend suggested that documented axonal loss (eg, widening 2PD, not further specified), and thus a more advanced stage of nerve compression, was a positive predictor for better surgical outcomes. Although this is not confirmed by other studies, a substantial part (38%) of the studies also included patients with past or present ulcers, indicative of more advanced stages or even end-stage neuropathy. The great variety in selection criteria used in previous cohort studies and trials, together with the varying symptoms, severity, complications, and comorbidities of DSP, pose great challenges in comparing available data.

Assessment of diabetic foot infections — When evaluating a diabetic foot infection, a problem-directed history and physical examination "should be obtained" and "A systematic approach to the complete assessment of these patients is required". Pain "should be considered an unreliable symptom in individuals with peripheral neuropathy". Constitutional symptoms are important clinical clues and "Severe infection or sepsis must be considered when these symptoms are present", yet "in about 50% of diabetic patients presenting with significant infection, systemic signs (fever and leukocytosis) are absent", and "Frequently, the only indication of infection is unexplained or recalcitrant hyperglycemia". Laboratory testing "might include a CBC with or without differential, blood cultures, glycosylated hemoglobin, fasting blood sugar, sedimentation rate, and urinalysis". The history and exam should include onset, duration, and pre-infection appearance, evaluate "Depth or size of the ulcer, amount of drainage, swelling, color, odor, and extent of infection", and the ulcer "should be probed to determine the presence of bone or joint involvement, sinus tracts, or extension into tendon sheaths".

### A systematic guideline by the ASPN workgroup on the evidence, education, and treatment algorithm for painful diabetic neuropathy: SWEET [^bc7278e3]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

PDN continues to remain a challenging condition to manage effectively. Tailoring treatment to individual patients, considering their comorbidities and preferences, is crucial for optimizing outcomes. Additionally, a multidisciplinary approach involving collaboration between primary care physicians, endocrinologists, interventional pain specialists, podiatrists, and other healthcare professionals is essential for comprehensive PDN management.

Physical Exam

Early detection of PDN is challenging due to the insidious nature of PDN and nonspecific symptoms. Patients frequently experience symptoms such as pins and needles, shocks, numbness, a feeling of walking on sandpaper or extra socks, and burning sensations. These symptoms often worsen at night and follow a stocking-glove distribution, initially affecting the feet and toes before progressing proximally. Evaluating medical history, family history, alcohol use, and medications, along with thorough physical exam is vital for early stage PDN identification. The American Diabetes Association recommends sensory tests such as the 128 Hz tuning fork, monofilament testing, thermal testing, pinprick sensations, deep tendon reflexes, and proprioceptive testing; see Figure 1. Additionally, laboratory investigations, electrodiagnostic studies, and skin biopsies may aid diagnosis and assess disease progression.

Diagnostic Approaches

Sensory Testing

Sensory testing plays a crucial role in evaluating peripheral nerve function in PDN. The 128 Hz tuning fork is utilized to assess vibratory sensation, reflecting the integrity of large sensory nerve fibers. The absence of perceived vibratory sensation indicates sensory impairment. The 10-g Semmes Weinstein monofilament test evaluates light touch perception and is used to assess large nerve fibers. The mono filament is designed to buckle under 10 g of pressure. Various testing sites, including the plantar aspect of the toes, metatarsal heads, dorsum of the hallux, midfoot, and plantar aspect of the heel, are recommended. Because the aforementioned exams test the large nerve fibers, positive tests are usually in the irreversible late stage of the disease progression.

Thermal Testing

Thermal testing, which assesses temperature perception, has shown promise in early detection of PDN, as it tests the small nerve fibers that are affected early in the disease progression. Reduced temperature sensations have been associated with up to 93% of individuals with glucose intolerance or DM. However, standardization and subjectivity remain challenges in this diagnostic modality.

Pinprick Sensations

The evaluation of pinprick sensations provides insight into the functionality of small myelinated A-delta fibers. By applying pressure using a pin or small gauge needle, the ability to perceive sharp stimuli is assessed. Inability to perceive the sharp sensation indicates abnormal sensory function. Despite its subjective nature, the pinprick test demonstrates high positive predictive value in diagnosing PDN.

Deep Tendon Reflexes

Deep tendon reflexes, particularly the Achilles and patellar reflexes, exhibit acceptable sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values associated with abnormal nerve conduction velocity (NCV). Impaired reflexes in these regions warrant further investigation, but evidence proposes deep tendon reflex testing as a valuable tool for early detection of PDN.

Proprioceptive Testing

Assessment of joint position sense provides valuable information regarding the effect of PDN on proprioceptive accuracy. Studies have shown a correlation between proprioceptive inaccuracy and altered diabetic neuropathy scores, supporting its utility as a diagnostic tool.

Laboratory Testing

Initial laboratory testing should include a complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic profile, fasting blood glucose, thyroid-stimulating hormone, and vitamin B12 levels. Serum protein electrophoresis with immunofixation is suggested by the AAN due to the association of monoclonal gammopathies with peripheral neuropathy. Laboratory testing should be performed on initial presentation/diagnosis. Although laboratory testing alone cannot diagnose PDN, it can be utilized as a screening test for etiologies attributed to peripheral neuropathy.

Electrodiagnostic Studies

Nerve conduction velocities and electromyography can aid in treatment planning once a comprehensive history and physical examination have been conducted. However, the utility of electrodiagnostic studies in the absence of suspicion of demyelinating disorders, nerve entrapment, or nerve injury remains debatable.

Skin Biopsies

Analysis of intraepidermal nerve fiber densities through small punch biopsy has emerged as a valuable and promising modality for the diagnosis and monitoring of early-stage PDN. This technique provides a distinct advantage over NCV studies, as it allows for the evaluation of small intraepidermal nerve fibers that are susceptible to early disease involvement. The biopsy procedure is easily performed, exhibits good reproducibility, and offers the capability to assess disease progression and potentially serve as an indicator of treatment response.

Acute Charcot arthropathy — clinical diagnosis relies on characteristic unilateral inflammatory changes in an insensate foot, frequent pain despite neuropathy, and awareness of ulceration that can mimic osteomyelitis. The initial diagnosis is often clinical, based on profound unilateral swelling, increased skin temperature, erythema, joint effusion, and bone resorption in an insensate foot; these characteristics in the presence of intact skin are often pathognomonic of acute neuroarthropathy. In more than 75% of cases, the patient will present with some degree of pain in an otherwise insensate extremity, and diagnosis can be complicated when patients first present with a concomitant ulceration, raising questions of potential contiguous osteomyelitis.

### Diagnostic characteristics of nerve conduction study parameters for vasculitic neuropathy [^727f2f9e]. Muscle & Nerve (2023). Medium credibility.

Our results suggest that the best electrodiagnostic approach to discriminate VN from other axonal polyneuropathies includes an evaluation of motor nerves and upper extremity nerves. This is interesting as studies have shown that lower extremity nerves (fibular motor and sural) are preferentially targeted over the upper extremity nerves in VN, and if the upper extremity is involved, the ulnar nerve tends to be primarily affected. Furthermore, the sural and superficial fibular sensory nerves have been preferentially targeted as nerves that should be studied bilaterally when performing EDX. This discrepancy between our findings and prior studies may be explained by our control group. Non‐inflammatory axonal polyneuropathies preferentially impact lower extremity nerves and sensory nerves. Once there is a significant reduction in the amplitude, a small absolute side‐to‐side difference can result in a higher side‐to‐side percentage difference. This is reflected in the high proportion of patients in the control group with 50% amplitude asymmetries in the fibular and tibial motor nerves. Likewise, non‐inflammatory axonal neuropathies can affect the upper extremities once they progress and become more severe.

Based on expert opinion, a proposed approach to EDX includes evaluating the sural, superficial fibular, median, ulnar, and radial sensory nerves and the fibular, tibial, median, and ulnar motor nerves unilaterally. The next step should be side‐to‐side comparisons of the sural and superficial fibular sensory responses, and any other sensory or motor nerve that shows a low amplitude on NCS. Based on our results, we suggest evaluating at least two different nerves side‐to‐side, one of which should include an upper extremity nerve (ulnar motor preferentially), and any other nerves showing a low amplitude. Analyzing the data with the z ‐score approach would be ideal, but a 50% side‐to‐side difference in amplitudes in at least two nerves is easier to calculate at the bedside and has a good discriminatory capability for VN. If a z ‐score approach is chosen, the clinician should determine which cut‐off to use. Both, the EDX findings and the clinical presentation are important to determine the risk–benefit ratio of a nerve biopsy.

Failure to identify sciatic neuropathy after traumatic injury to the lower extremity may lead to the delayed institution of neuropathic pharmacotherapy, electrodiagnostic testing, physical therapy, and increased risk for the development of complex regional pain syndrome. This article presents a case of an adolescent male with neuropathic pain and weakness in the right lower extremity after traumatic injury. Spontaneous recovery of the injured nerve occurred with early institution of pharmacologic and physical therapies. Operative exploration and neurolysis were considered but were not ultimately necessary.

### Peripheral neuropathy: differential diagnosis and management [^d3d7f6bb]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Peripheral neuropathy has a variety of systemic, metabolic, and toxic causes. The most common treatable causes include diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, and nutritional deficiencies. The diagnosis requires careful clinical assessment, judicious laboratory testing, and electrodiagnostic studies or nerve biopsy if the diagnosis remains unclear. A systematic approach begins with localization of the lesion to the peripheral nerves, identification of the underlying etiology, and exclusion of potentially treatable causes. Initial blood tests should include a complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic profile, and measurement of erythrocyte sedimentation rate and fasting blood glucose, vitamin B12, and thyroid-stimulating hormone levels; specialized tests should be ordered if clinically indicated. Lumbar puncture and cerebrospinal fluid analysis may be helpful in the diagnosis of Guillain-Barré syndrome and chronic inflammatory demyelinating neuropathy. Electrodiagnostic studies, including nerve conduction studies and electromyography, can help in the differentiation of axonal versus demyelinating or mixed neuropathy. Treatment should address the underlying disease process, correct any nutritional deficiencies, and provide symptomatic treatment.

### One-stop microvascular screening service: an effective model for the early detection of diabetic peripheral neuropathy and the high-risk foot [^3efbd353]. Diabetic Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

What's new?

A novel, one‐stop microvascular screening service in a hospital and community setting was initiated, whereby people with diabetes attending the annual eye screening, which has a high uptake, also underwent foot assessment aimed at detecting early peripheral neuropathy and the at‐risk foot requiring referral to the Foot Protection Team. Foot examination was carried out by a podiatrist. The service also identified previously undiagnosed painful neuropathy and had a high patient acceptability level.
The service used novel, validated point‐of‐care devices for combined large‐ and small‐nerve‐fibre assessment, with the aim of diagnosing peripheral neuropathy early.

Experts' Recommendations for Early Intervention with Neurotropic B Vitamins

Embracing vitamin B supplements as a cornerstone and complementary approach to PN treatment holds significant promise. Studies indicate the potential alleviation of neuropathy symptoms through B vitamins, although trials face limitations, particularly in non-diabetic cases where pre-treatment vitamin levels are examined. The nuanced roles of specific B vitamins contribute to their therapeutic impact, with vitamin B 1 supporting energy metabolism and antioxidative functions crucial for neural function, vitamin B 6 acting as a coenzyme in neurotransmitter synthesis, and vitamin B 12 being vital for myelin synthesis and nerve repair. Understanding the intracellular action mechanisms of B vitamins in nociceptive pathways sheds light on their potential to lower excitability, reduce sensitization, modulate neuroinflammation, and impact neurotransmitter systems involved in pain modulation. The critical importance of neuropathy screening is emphasized for high-risk individuals, especially those with diabetes or belonging to at-risk groups, where vitamin B supplementation becomes pivotal. The utilization of a combined B complex, such as neurotropic B vitamins, emerges as a potential avenue for improved outcomes, especially for patients less responsive to B 12 treatment alone. In the context of type 2 diabetes, the connection between low B 1 and B 6 levels and reduced homocysteine is noted, emphasizing the relevance of B-vitamin deficiencies in diabetic nerve complications. Furthermore, the impact of B 1 extends to influencing conditions like fatty liver disease, underscoring the need for proactive assessment and targeted supplementation strategies. For patients experiencing sensory peripheral neuropathy associated with metabolic diseases or medications, an initial high dose of neurotropic B vitamins (B 1, B 6, and B 12) may offer relief, followed by a transition to a lower maintenance dose upon symptom improvement. Treatment is warranted for any B 12 level below 400 pmol/L, considering overall well-being and potential cognitive function decline, with regular monitoring recommended for individuals at risk or diagnosed with PN. Oral vitamin B 1 (thiamine), B 6 (pyridoxine), and B 12 (cobalamin) are generally well tolerated, with rare instances of side effects, making them considered safe for use (Fig. 4). B-vitamin deficiency is indeed more common in low-income countries. In high-resource settings, replacement of B vitamins should be based on initial laboratory tests. To determine their effectiveness definitively, adequately powered randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are needed.

Peripheral neuropathy

The aim of screening is to identify patients with loss of protective sensation in the feet. Most guidelines recommend the 10 g monofilament for neuropathy assessment (fig 4) in people with diabetes. This monofilament exerts a 10 g buckling force when it bends. An inability to sense a 10 g pressure is the current consensus definition of loss of protective sensation. The test is portable, cheap, and easy to perform (box 1). Despite the widespread use of the monofilament test, its accuracy in diagnosing neuropathy is variable. The test may be combined with another test to screen for neuropathy, such as a biothesiometer or a graduated tuning fork (Rydel Seiffer) to assess vibration perception threshold.

Fig 4 Monofilament test: testing sites and application. The nine plantar sites are the distal great toe; third toe; fifth toe; first, third, and fifth metatarsal heads; medial foot, lateral foot, and heel; and one dorsal site

Peripheral arterial disease

Ask for a history of intermittent claudication and rest pain, which suggest peripheral arterial disease. Palpate the posterior tibial artery and dorsalis pedis artery in both feet and record pulsations as absent or present.

The ankle brachial index is an adjunct measure to diagnose peripheral arterial disease. It is the ratio of the highest systolic blood pressure at the ankle (dorsalis pedis artery or posterior tibial artery) to the systolic blood pressure at the arm, and is measured using a Doppler device. See box 2 on grading the severity of obstruction. Measurement of the ankle brachial index is user dependent. People with diabetes can often have falsely raised ankle brachial index levels as a result of poor compressibility from calcified arteries. Furthermore, availability of equipment, time constraints, and lack of training are reported as major barriers to ankle brachial index testing in primary care.

On the basis of this initial assessment, patients can be categorised as having a low, moderate, or high risk of diabetic foot (see infographic).

### Quality improvement in neurology: distal symmetric polyneuropathy quality measures [^282ca1b8]. Neurology (2014). Medium credibility.

Distal symmetric polyneuropathy (DSP) epidemiology and diagnostic evaluation — Peripheral neuropathy affects 2% to 8% of the population, and in 1999, 8.6% of Medicare beneficiaries had neuropathy with treatment costs estimated at $3.5 billion (Consumer Price Index adjusted to 2013 $4.9 billion). Among diabetic patients, reported DSP prevalence rates range from 15% to 37%, and in impaired glucose tolerance rates have been reported as 11%. DSP can result in weakness, sensory loss, pain, autonomic dysfunction, gait impairment, falls, disability, and impaired quality of life. In evaluating a patient with DSP, at a minimum the clinical pattern of involvement, nerve conduction studies, and laboratory tests should be obtained to diagnose the condition and to identify potential treatable etiologies, yet recent studies have demonstrated that adequate diagnostic studies are often not performed in patients with peripheral neuropathy.

### Diagnostic imaging of the diabetic foot: an EANM evidence-based guidance [^60a1136f]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2024). Medium credibility.

Accurately diagnosing DFI is a clinical challenge, as the cardinal symptoms and signs of infection can be masked (or occasionally mimicked) by the presence of peripheral neuropathy or ischaemia, and positive wound culture results may only represent colonisation of the overlying soft tissues, rather than infection. As more than 50% of diabetic foot wounds are infected at their presentation, and the outcome of treatment is highly linked to how quickly the diagnosis of STI and OM are made, making an appropriate and prompt diagnosis is mandatory in order to avoid bad outcomes.

A further issue complicating diagnosing diabetic foot lesions is the need to consider Charcot foot (CF), an inflammatory, potentially destructive foot disorder that mainly involves tarsal and metatarsal joints. If not promptly diagnosed and properly treated, it is a progressive degenerative musculoskeletal disease that can lead to crippling destruction of the foot. The presence of neuro-osteo-arthropathy represents an additional diagnostic challenge for clinicians, since it may coexist with (or be the cause of) diabetic foot ulcers, and may lead to superimposed infections. Nevertheless, an accurate differential diagnosis between OM, STI and CF is crucial for the correct management, since these three conditions require very different treatments.

In 2008, the International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot (IWGDF) published a systematic review on treatment of diabetic foot OM, which only includes a "progress report" on diagnosis. Clinical guidelines, from the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and from the IWGDF have been published and updated, more recently in 2023, provide diagnostic guidance, largely based on clinical aspects. The initial approach to a diabetic patient with a foot complication includes a detailed clinical history (especially of any recent but healed wounds, or antimicrobial therapy), a physical examination (especially for evidence of peripheral neuropathy or peripheral arterial disease of the affected foot), blood tests (for glycaemic control, routine chemistry and inflammatory markers) and plain X-rays of the foot. The findings of these evaluations, even in combination, can be inconclusive, thus requiring further advanced investigations.

### Electrodiagnostic approach to patients with weakness [^2428a64b]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Electrodiagnosis has a key role in the evaluation of patients presenting with weakness. The electrodiagnostician should maintain a broad inclusive differential diagnosis and tailor the examination using a sound conceptual framework. A clear understanding of what is normal provides the proper foundation upon which to judge electrodiagnostic findings. Many peripheral neuromuscular conditions manifest themselves in characteristic ways on NEE and nerve conduction testing, making them identifiable to the skilled electrodiagnostic medicine consultant.

Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) management — vascular imaging, tissue biopsy, and diagnostic testing — includes conditional recommendations as follows: For suspected PAN, clinicians "conditionally recommend using abdominal vascular imaging to aid in establishing a diagnosis and determining the extent of disease". For a history of severe PAN with abdominal involvement who become clinically asymptomatic, they "conditionally recommend follow-up abdominal vascular imaging". For suspected PAN involving the skin, they "conditionally recommend obtaining a deep-skin biopsy specimen (i.e., a biopsy reaching the medium-sized vessels of the dermis) over a superficial skin punch biopsy to aid in establishing a diagnosis". For suspected PAN with peripheral neuropathy, they "conditionally recommend obtaining a combined nerve and muscle biopsy over a nerve biopsy alone to aid in establishing a diagnosis". For a history of peripheral motor neuropathy secondary to PAN, they "conditionally recommend serial neurologic examinations instead of repeated electromyography/ nerve conduction studies (e.g., every 6 months) to monitor disease activity".

### Evaluation of distal symmetric polyneuropathy: the role of laboratory and genetic testing (an evidence-based review) [^370c1d7a]. Muscle & Nerve (2009). Medium credibility.

Distal symmetric polyneuropathy — laboratory testing caveats are highlighted by noting that the finding of a laboratory abnormality does not necessarily mean that the abnormality is etiologically significant, that there is a relatively high prevalence of impaired glucose tolerance in patients with distal symmetric polyneuropathy that may not be causally associated with the pathobiology of the peripheral nervous system, and that there is a need to determine whether aggressive treatment or reversal of specific laboratory abnormalities improves or alters the course of polyneuropathy.
