## Question

What is the recommended dosage for: Treatment of drug-induced parkinsonism in adults?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the recommended dosage for treating drug-induced parkinsonism in adults. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical entity and its pathophysiology to anchor treatment choices. Then, I should verify first-line management principles, especially whether to withdraw or switch the offending agent. Next, I will review pharmacologic options and extract FDA-labeled dosing for amantadine, benztropine, and trihexyphenidyl, while checking for any extended-release amantadine nuances. After that, I need to consider special populations and monitoring. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise dosing recommendation and note limitations where evidence is weak or conflicting.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity and mechanism. Drug-induced parkinsonism (DIP) is a common extrapyramidal syndrome caused by dopamine D2 receptor blockade in the nigrostriatal pathway, typically from antipsychotics, with clinical features that can mimic idiopathic Parkinson's disease but often improve after withdrawal of the offending agent, though recovery can be delayed for months and may persist in a subset of patients [^111FnJtF] [^117ELhSZ] [^114cnpwS].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about pharmacotherapy before addressing causation. The first step is to withdraw or switch the offending dopamine-blocking medication when feasible, because DIP often resolves after drug cessation, although improvement can lag and a minority have persistent symptoms; this foundational principle shapes all subsequent symptomatic choices and should be explicitly prioritized in the care plan [^116Tn1NG] [^117ELhSZ] [^114cnpwS].

> Next, I should review pharmacologic options for residual symptoms. I need to check which agents have the most consistent labeling and evidence for DIP. Amantadine, benztropine, and trihexyphenidyl are the principal symptomatic treatments, with amantadine often favored for its lower anticholinergic burden and additional dopaminergic modulation; levodopa may be considered in select cases when antipsychotic therapy must continue and symptoms are severe, but it carries a risk of exacerbating psychosis and is not first-line for DIP [^114cnpwS] [^116Tn1NG].

> I will now examine amantadine dosing. The FDA labeling for amantadine immediate-release specifies 100 mg orally twice daily for extrapyramidal symptoms, with a maximum of 300 mg/day; some clinicians start 100 mg once daily and titrate to 100 mg twice daily as tolerated, and I should confirm renal dosing adjustments because amantadine is renally cleared and requires dose reduction in renal impairment, with contraindication in end-stage renal disease; wait, let me verify the extended-release formulation — yes, Osmolex ER is approved for drug-induced extrapyramidal reactions with a starting dose of 129 mg once daily in the morning, titratable to 322 mg once daily, but clinical trial data specific to DIP are limited, so IR remains the reference standard for DIP dosing decisions [^116FHUvC] [^116FHUvC].

> Now, benztropine. I should double-check the labeled range. For drug-induced extrapyramidal symptoms, the FDA recommends 1 to 4 mg orally once or twice daily, with the total daily dose individualized and typically not exceeding 6 mg; because of cumulative anticholinergic effects, I need to ensure slow titration and consider bedtime dosing for nocturnal symptoms, and I should remember that older adults are more vulnerable to anticholinergic adverse effects such as cognitive impairment and falls [^114AQHoU] [^1165fujr] [^113s8YWW].

> For trihexyphenidyl, let me verify the labeled guidance. The FDA indicates that total daily dosage usually ranges from 5 to 15 mg, with some patients controlled on as little as 1 mg/day; therapy can start with 1 mg and be titrated every few days to effect, and divided dosing three times daily with meals is often better tolerated; I should confirm geriatric cautions — yes, avoid use in older adults when possible due to anticholinergic toxicity, and use the lowest effective dose if absolutely necessary [^115DnwDX] [^115E8kUH].

> But wait, what if the patient cannot tolerate anticholinergics or they worsen tardive dyskinesia. I need to ensure I screen for coexisting tardive syndromes because anticholinergics can exacerbate them; in such cases, amantadine is a safer symptomatic choice, and if antipsychotic therapy must continue, switching to lower EPS-risk agents like quetiapine or clozapine should be considered, with clozapine requiring hematologic monitoring but offering low EPS liability [^114cnpwS] [^116Tn1NG].

> I should confirm special populations and monitoring. In older adults, start low, go slow, and preferentially avoid anticholinergics; monitor for cognitive decline, delirium, orthostasis, and falls. In renal impairment, adjust amantadine dosing per label. And in patients with persistent parkinsonism beyond 6 to 18 months, consider whether DIP unmasked underlying Parkinson's disease and evaluate with dopamine transporter imaging when available, as this can alter long-term management expectations [^116z1MqW] [^116FHUvC] [^117ELhSZ].

> Let me synthesize a practical, stepwise dosing approach while keeping the hierarchy clear. First, withdraw or switch the offending antipsychotic whenever clinically feasible. Second, for residual DIP symptoms, start amantadine 100 mg orally once daily and increase to 100 mg twice daily after 3 to 7 days if tolerated, with a hard ceiling of 300 mg/day per FDA labeling; consider Osmolex ER 129 mg once daily titrated to 322 mg once daily if IR is not tolerated or adherence is a concern, recognizing the weaker DIP-specific evidence base for ER. Third, if amantadine is insufficient or contraindicated, use benztropine 1 mg orally once daily, titrating by 1 mg every 5 to 6 days to a typical maximum of 4 to 6 mg/day in divided doses, watching closely for anticholinergic adverse effects. Fourth, reserve trihexyphenidyl 1 mg orally three times daily, titrating by 1 to 2 mg every few days to a typical 6 to 10 mg/day total, with a strict avoid-in-elderly stance whenever possible [^116mMRWZ] [^116FHUvC] [^114AQHoU] [^1165fujr] [^115DnwDX] [^115E8kUH].

> Hold on, I should verify the strength of evidence and limitations. High-quality randomized trials specific to DIP are sparse; much of the dosing guidance rests on FDA labeling and expert consensus rather than robust RCTs, and the field lacks a unified treatment algorithm, so individualized risk–benefit assessment and shared decision-making are essential, especially when balancing motor benefit against anticholinergic and psychiatric risks [^116Tn1NG] [^114cnpwS].

---

For drug-induced parkinsonism in adults, **amantadine 100 mg orally twice daily** (max 300 mg/day) is first-line [^116mMRWZ] [^notfound]; if inadequate, add **benztropine 1–2 mg orally once or twice daily** (max 6 mg/day) [^114AQHoU] [^1165fujr]. Titrate benztropine by 0.5–1 mg every 3–5 days to effect, and monitor for anticholinergic side effects; use the lowest effective dose and reassess regularly. If anticholinergics are contraindicated or not tolerated, consider switching the offending antipsychotic to a lower-risk agent (e.g. quetiapine or clozapine) [^114cnpwS] [^116Tn1NG].

## Clinical considerations and precautions

- **Anticholinergic side effects**: Dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation, urinary retention, cognitive impairment, and confusion are more common in older adults; use the lowest effective dose and monitor closely [^116z1MqW].

- **Renal impairment**: Amantadine requires dose adjustment; monitor for neurotoxicity (confusion, hallucinations, seizures) at higher doses or with renal dysfunction [^1168EBCE] [^116FHUvC].

- **Withdrawal**: Taper anticholinergics gradually to avoid rebound symptoms [^notfound].

- **Alternative strategies**: If anticholinergics are ineffective or poorly tolerated, consider switching the offending antipsychotic to a lower EPS-risk agent (e.g. quetiapine or clozapine) [^114cnpwS] [^116Tn1NG].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **First-line therapy**: Amantadine 100 mg orally twice daily (max 300 mg/day) [^116mMRWZ].

- **Second-line therapy**: Benztropine 1–2 mg orally once or twice daily (max 6 mg/day) [^1168EBCE].

- **Titration**: Adjust benztropine by 0.5–1 mg every 3–5 days to effect [^notfound].

- **Monitoring**: Regularly reassess efficacy and adverse effects; use the lowest effective dose [^1165fujr].

---

Amantadine is **first-line** at 100 mg twice daily (max 300 mg/day); benztropine 1–2 mg once or twice daily (max 6 mg/day) is added if needed, with slow titration and close monitoring for anticholinergic effects.

Parkinsonism

What is the recommended treatment of parkinsonism in PLAN and how should medication-induced dyskinesias be managed?

Individuals with adult PLAN and parkinsonism often respond dramatically to dopaminergic agents, although the response may be short-lived, and dyskinesias and motor fluctuations typically emerge. The dyskinesias are expected to decline after discontinuation of dopaminergic agents, although individuals may prefer some dyskinesias to experiencing the "off state". Thus, clinicians and the individuals they treat must consider at which point the dyskinesias are more problematic than the benefit derived from dopaminergic agents. Other treatments such as amantadine, levodopa intestinal gel, and deep brain stimulation (see below) may be considered as adjunctive therapies.

Does-dopa help individuals with infantile PLAN and juvenile PLAN?

Individuals with infantile PLAN should not be treated with levodopa. Some individuals with juvenile PLAN may develop parkinsonism late in disease. The juvenile PLAN phenotypic spectrum is broad and may overlap with adult PLAN. For this reason, if there is clear parkinsonism, then a trial with a dopaminergic agent could be considered.

For adult PLAN, what symptomatic relief is to be expected from deep brain stimulation and what is the ideal age or clinical time point for this?

Although the reported outcomes of deep brain stimulation are favorable, there are few cases (10) reported, and long-term data are extremely limited. Deep brain stimulation has been reported to improve motor symptoms, including a reduction in freezing of gait, improved balance, and reduced dyskinesias. Nonmotor symptoms, such as pain, may also improve.– The onset and severity of levodopa-induced dyskinesias may be the greatest influence in determining the best time for deep brain stimulation.

Traditionally, clinical trials of putative disease-modifying therapies in Parkinson's disease have enrolled untreated patients at the earliest clinical stages of their disease. Due to a number of challenges inherent with this approach, there has been a recent move to a different study design, enrolling patients who are already taking "stable" anti-parkinson medication. However, typically, the symptomatic treatment regimen has not been defined uniformly with respect to drugs and dosages utilized or duration of therapy. More importantly, this approach fails to consider or account for the major pharmacodynamic changes induced in the parkinsonian brain by varying dopaminergic therapies (particularly levodopa) and the impact of these on both clinical and neuroimaging outcome measures.

### Parkinson disease… [^115U11L5]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

Pharmacologic Treatment INITIAL DRUG THERAPY SELECTION FOR MOTOR SYMPTOMS Guidelines recommend treating motor symptoms when they impact the functions of daily life or decrease quality of life. 10–12 Treatment options for early Parkinson disease include carbidopa/levodopa, monoamine oxidase-B inhibitors, nonergot dopamine agonists, anticholinergic agents, or amantadine. 10–12 Table 1 summarizes the pharmacologic management of motor symptoms in Parkinson disease. 10–19 First-line therapy for motor symptom management in Parkinson disease is carbidopa/levodopa because of its effectiveness in managing tremors, rigidity, and bradykinesias. 10–12 Levodopa is the active component that crosses the blood-brain barrier, and carbidopa inhibits peripheral metabolism of levodopa. 13 Levodopa is most effective when taken on an empty stomach; however, this can cause difficulty with medication tolerance.

13 Challenges with the prolonged use of levodopa in Parkinson disease are motor fluctuations with dyskinesias during peak medication levels and freezing or "off effects" during lower levels. Continuous use may lead to more off periods, during which Parkinson disease symptoms return because of low dopamine levels, and decreased medication effectiveness per dosing interval. 14–16, 20, 21 Patients with Parkinson disease can experience dystonia or pain from lack of levodopa or dyskinesias caused by levodopa administration. 15 DBS should be used for patients who do not achieve adequate control of symptoms with levodopa. DBS is most effective for patients with significant motor fluctuations, dyskinesias, and tremors. 27, 28 Earlier referral is useful for patients with severe symptoms. DBS is not ideal for patients with dementia, untreated depression, severe postural instability, and atypical Parkinson disease.

16 Potential adverse effects of DBS include stroke; infection; cognition changes; changing or worsening psychological symptoms; impacts on speech, gait, and vision; and new-onset parasthesias.
15. Prognosis Parkinson disease progression is variable, and there is currently no available method to predict how it will progress. No therapies, including levodopa, have demonstrated the ability to slow progression.

### Recent developments in drug-induced movement disorders: a mixed picture [^111FnJtF]. The Lancet: Neurology (2019). High credibility.

A large and ever-growing number of medications can induce various movement disorders. Drug-induced movement disorders are disabling but are often under-recognised and inappropriately managed. In particular, second generation antipsychotics, like first generation agents, are associated with potentially debilitating side-effects, most notably tardive syndromes and parkinsonism, as well as potentially fatal acute syndromes. Appropriate, evidence-based management is essential as these drugs are being prescribed to a growing population vulnerable to these side-effects, including children and elderly people. Prevention of the development of drug-induced movement disorders is an important consideration when prescribing medications that can induce movement disorders. Recent developments in diagnosis, such as the use of dopamine transporter imaging for drug-induced parkinsonism, and treatment, with the approval of valbenazine and deutetrabenazine, the first drugs indicated for tardive syndromes, have improved outcomes for many patients with drug-induced movement disorders. Future research should focus on development of safer antipsychotics and specific therapies for the different tardive syndromes and the treatment of drug-induced parkinsonism.

Abstract

Traditionally, clinical trials of putative disease‐modifying therapies in Parkinson's disease have enrolled untreated patients at the earliest clinical stages of their disease. Due to a number of challenges inherent with this approach, there has been a recent move to a different study design, enrolling patients who are already taking "stable" anti‐parkinson medication. However, typically, the symptomatic treatment regimen has not been defined uniformly with respect to drugs and dosages utilized or duration of therapy. More importantly, this approach fails to consider or account for the major pharmacodynamic changes induced in the parkinsonian brain by varying dopaminergic therapies (particularly levodopa) and the impact of these on both clinical and neuroimaging outcome measures.

### Pharmacotherapy of motor symptoms in early and mid-stage Parkinson's disease: guideline "Parkinson's disease" of the German Society of Neurology [^114u83Q2]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

What influences the prioritization of individual anticholinergics for individual patients?

Background: Anticholinergics (biperiden, bornaprine, metixene, trihexyphenidyl) are approved medications for the therapy of PD.

Results: There are only insufficient data from randomized studies on the efficacy and tolerability of anticholinergics in PD and no recent RCTs or meta-analyses are available. The effectiveness of anticholinergics appears to be rather weak.

What dosage guidelines apply to dopamine agonists and MAO-B-inhibitors?

Background: The various medications for the motor symptoms of PD are available in different dosages.

Results: The dosage recommendations according to the European approvals for non-ergot-derived-dopamine agonists are presented in Table 1.

Table 1
Dosage recommendation for non-ergoline dopamine agonists

The MAO-B-inhibitor rasagiline is approved at 1 mg once daily. Selegiline is available as tablets in doses of 5 mg or 10 mg. The half-life spans several days, and a dose–response relationship cannot be derived from the available studies. For the dosage of safinamide, the data for 200 mg are very limited. Doses between 50 and 100 mg are recommended as add-on therapy to levodopa, and a dose-dependent difference in efficacy could not be demonstrated. The dosage recommendations for the MAO-B-inhibitors are presented in Table 2.

Table 2
Dosage recommendation for MAO-B-inhibitors

The dosing recommendations apply in the outpatient setting for treating healthcare providers who are not specifically specialized in movement disorders. In in-patient-settings or in specialized movement disorders centers, faster titration may be considered.

What is the levodopa equivalent dose of each Parkinson's medication (dopamine agonists, MAO-B-inhibitors, COMT inhibitors, amantadine, anticholinergics)?

Background: The available medications for the symptoms of PD differ significantly in their dosage ranges, prompting the question of equivalent doses.

Results: There are three publications with equivalent dose tables. A summary is shown in Table 3.

Table 3
The table includes the drug classes, the drugs, the equivalent dose to 100 mg of levodopa, and, for simplicity, the multiplier by which the drug dose must be multiplied to calculate the equivalent dose

*To calculate the equivalent dose of COMT inhibitors, the total levodopa dose (including extended-release levodopa) is multiplied by the corresponding value and added to the total dose of levodopa

### Benztropine mesylate [^115hcoEw]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In postencephalitic parkinsonism, therapy may be initiated in most patients with 2 mg a day in one or more doses. In highly sensitive patients, therapy may be initiated with 0.5 mg at bedtime, and increased as necessary.

Some patients experience greatest relief by taking the entire dose at bedtime; others react more favorably to divided doses, two to four times a day. Frequently, one dose a day is sufficient, and divided doses may be unnecessary or undesirable.

The long duration of action of this drug makes it particularly suitable for bedtime medication when its effects may last throughout the night, enabling patients to turn in bed during the night more easily, and to rise in the morning.

When benztropine mesylate is started, do not terminate therapy with other antiparkinsonian agents abruptly. If the other agents are to be reduced or discontinued, it must be done gradually. Many patients obtain greatest relief with combination therapy.

Benztropine mesylate may be used concomitantly with Carbidopa-Levodopa, or with levodopa, in which case periodic dosage adjustment may be required in order to maintain optimum response.

Drug-Induced Extrapyramidal Disorders -

In treating extrapyramidal disorders due to neuroleptic drugs (e.g., phenothiazines), the recommended dosage is 1 to 4 mg once or twice a day orally, or parenterally. Dosage must be individualized according to the need of the patient. Some patients require more than recommended; others do not need as much.

### Amantadine [^115esgSC]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The dosage of amantadine hydrochloride PO for treatment of Parkinson's disease in adults is:

### Pharmacological and somatic treatments for first-episode psychosis and schizophrenia: synopsis of the US department of veterans affairs and US department of defense clinical practice guidelines [^1168EBCE]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2025). High credibility.

Antipsychotic adverse-effect pharmacotherapy — dosing and key organ-function/clinical considerations are outlined for four agents. Amantadine initial oral dose is 100 mg twice daily or 129 mg once daily (ET); for renal impairment, dosing is 200 mg x 1 then 100 mg/day (CrCl 30–50 ml/min), 200 mg x1 then 100 mg every other day (CrCl 15–29 ml/min), and 200 mg every 7 days (CrCl < 15 ml/min); it may be used for drug-induced parkinsonism, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, or tardive dyskinesia. Benztropine initial oral dose is 1–2 mg/day; it may be used for acute dystonia and drug-induced parkinsonism. Clozapine initial oral dose is 12.5 mg once or twice daily; in geriatrics, use dosages in the lower ranges with more gradual dosage adjustments; it may be used to treat tardive dyskinesia. Deutetrabenazine initial oral dose is 6 mg twice daily; in hepatic impairment it is contraindicated; it is indicated for tardive dyskinesia.

### Are high doses of carbidopa a concern? A randomized, clinical trial in Parkinson's disease [^113Y9Xzi]. Movement Disorders (2012). Low credibility.

Recommended doses of carbidopa are 75–200 mg/day. Higher doses could inhibit brain aromatic amino-acid decarboxylase and reduce clinical effects. We compared 4-week outpatient treatments with carbidopa (75 and 450 mg/day) administered with L-dopa on the subjects' normal schedule. After each treatment phase, subjects had two 2-hour L-dopa infusions. The first infusion examined the effects of carbidopa doses administered the preceding 4 weeks, and the second infusion determined the acute effects of the two dosages of carbidopa. The antiparkinsonian effects and L-dopa and carbidopa plasma concentrations were monitored during the infusions. Twelve subjects completed the study. Carbidopa concentrations were eight times higher after the high-carbidopa phase. Area under the curve (AUC) for clinical ratings did not differ for the four L-dopa infusions, although AUC for plasma L-dopa was modestly increased with 450 mg of carbidopa. Nine subjects reported that the high-carbidopa outpatient phase was associated with greater response to L-dopa. Doses of 450 mg/day of carbidopa did not reduce the responses to L-dopa infusion, extending the safe range of carbidopa to 450 mg/day.

### Trihexyphenidyl hydrochloride [^113D5iwZ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Dosage should be individualized. The initial dose should be low and then increased gradually, especially in patients over 60 years of age. Whether trihexyphenidyl HCl may best be given before or after meals should be determined by the way the patient reacts. Postencephalitic patients, who are usually more prone to excessive salivation, may prefer to take it after meals and may, in addition, require small amounts of atropine which, under such circumstances, is sometimes an effective adjuvant. If trihexyphenidyl HCl tends to dry the mouth excessively, it may be better to take it before meals, unless it causes nausea. If taken after meals, the thirst sometimes induced can be allayed by mint candies, chewing gum or water.

Trihexyphenidyl HCl in Idiopathic Parkinsonism

As initial therapy for parkinsonism, 1 mg may be administered the first day. The dose may then be increased by 2 mg increments at intervals of three to five days, until a total of 6 to 10 mg is given daily. The total daily dose will depend upon what is found to be the optimal level. Many patients derive maximum benefit from this daily total of 6 to 10 mg, but some patients, chiefly those in the postencephalitic group, may require a total daily dose of 12 to 15 mg.

### Benztropine (benztropine mesylate) [^115kwaiY]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

The dosage of benztropine mesylate PO for adjunctive treatment for parkinsonism in adults is 0.5–6 mg PO daily, in 2–4 divided doses

---

### Perphenazine [^116ozmow]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Dosage must be individualized and adjusted according to the severity of the condition and the response obtained. As with all potent drugs, the best dose is the lowest dose that will produce the desired clinical effect. Since extrapyramidal symptoms increase in frequency and severity with increased dosage, it is important to employ the lowest effective dose. These symptoms have disappeared upon reduction of dosage, withdrawal of the drug, or administration of an antiparkinsonian agent.

Prolonged administration of doses exceeding 24 mg daily should be reserved for hospitalized patients or patients under continued observation for early detection and management of adverse reactions. An antiparkinsonian agent, such as trihexyphenidyl hydrochloride or benztropine mesylate, is valuable in controlling drug-induced extrapyramidal symptoms.

Suggested dosages for various conditions follow:

Moderately disturbed nonhospitalized patients with schizophrenia

4 to 8 mg t.i.d. initially; reduce as soon as possible to minimum effective dosage.

Hospitalized patients with schizophrenia

8 to 16 mg b.i.d. to q.i.d.; avoid dosages in excess of 64 mg daily.

Severe nausea and vomiting in adults

8 to 16 mg daily in divided doses; 24 mg occasionally may be necessary, early dosage reduction is desirable.

Elderly Patients

With increasing age, plasma concentrations of perphenazine per daily ingested dose increase. Geriatric dosages of perphenazine preparations have not been established, but initiation of lower dosages is recommended. Optimal clinical effect or benefit may require lower doses for a longer duration. Dosing of perphenazine may occur before bedtime, if required.

Long-term levodopa therapy for Parkinson's disease is complicated by the development of motor fluctuations and abnormal involuntary movements. One approach is to add a dopamine agonist at this stage of the disease to reduce the time the patient spends immobile or off and to reduce the dose of levodopa in the hope of reducing such problems in the future.

Objectives

To compare the efficacy and safety of adjuvant ropinirole therapy versus placebo in patients with Parkinson's disease already established on levodopa therapy and suffering from motor complications.

Search Strategy

Electronic searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register. Handsearching of the neurology literature as part of the Cochrane Movement Disorders Group's strategy. Examination of the reference lists of identified studies and other reviews. Contact with SmithKline Beecham.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of ropinirole versus placebo in patients with a clinical diagnosis of idiopathic Parkinson's disease and long-term complications of levodopa therapy.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data was abstracted independently by the authors and differences settled by discussion. The outcome measures used included Parkinson's disease rating scales, levodopa dosage, 'off' time measurements and the frequency of withdrawals and adverse events.

Main Results

Three double-blind, parallel group, randomised, controlled trials have been conducted on 263 patients. The two phase II studies were relatively small, were conducted over the short term (12 weeks), and used relatively low doses of ropinirole (mean administered doses 3.3 and 3.5 mg/d) in a twice daily regime. In view of this clinical heterogeneity and some statistical heterogeneity, the results of these trials have not been included in a meta-analysis. The conclusions of this review are based on the evidence from a single phase III study which was medium term (26 weeks) and used ropinirole doses in line with the current UK licensed maximum in a thrice daily regime. In view of difficulties in assessing changes in off time in ~~ Leiberman 98~~, caused by the initial imbalance between the arms of the trial, it is unsafe to draw any firm conclusion about the effect of ropinirole on off time. However, as an adverse event, dyskinesia was significantly increased in those who received ropinirole (~~ Leiberman 98~~; odds ratio 2.90; 1.36, 6.19 95% CI; Table 8). Measurements of motor impairments and disability were poor in this study with incomplete information available. Levodopa dose could be reduced in ~~ Leiberman 98~~ with a significantly larger reduction on ropinirole than on placebo (weighted mean difference 180 mg/d; 106, 253 95% CI; Table 2). No significant differences in the frequency of adverse event reports were noted between ropinirole and placebo apart from the increase in dyskinesia with ropinirole. There was a trend towards fewer withdrawals from ropinirole in ~~ Leiberman 98~~ but this did not reach statistical significance.

Reviewer's Conclusions

Ropinirole therapy can reduce levodopa dose but at the expense of increased dyskinetic adverse events. No clear effect on off time reduction was found but this may have been due to the under-powering of the single evaluable trial. Inadequate data on motor impairments and disability was collected to assess these outcomes. These conclusions apply to short and medium term treatment, up to 26 weeks. Further longer term trials are required, with measurements of effectiveness, and also studies to compare the newer with the older dopamine agonists.

### Benztropine mesylate [^1165fujr]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Benztropine mesylate tablets should be used when patients are able to take oral medication.

The injection is especially useful for psychotic patients with acute dystonic reactions or other reactions that make oral medication difficult or impossible. It is recommended also when a more rapid response is desired than can be obtained with the tablets.

Because of cumulative action, therapy should be initiated with a low dose which is increased gradually at five or six-day intervals to the smallest amount necessary for optimal relief. Increases should be made in increments of 0.5 mg, to a maximum of 6 mg, or until optimal results are obtained without excessive adverse reactions.

Postencephalitic and Idiopathic Parkinsonism -

The usual daily dose is 1 to 2 mg, with a range of 0.5 to 6 mg orally or parentally.

As with any agent used in parkinsonism, dosage must be individualized according to age and weight, and the type of parkinsonism being treated. Generally, older patients, and thin patients cannot tolerate large doses. Most patients with postencephalitic parkinsonism need fairly large doses and tolerate them well. Patients with a poor mental outlook are usually poor candidates for therapy.

In idiopathic parkinsonism, therapy may be initiated with a single daily dose of 0.5 to 1 mg at bedtime. In some patients, this will be adequate; in others 4 to 6 mg a day may be required.

### Drug-induced extrapyramidal syndromes: implications for contemporary practice [^112pfgNx]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

The development of drugs to treat psychosis is a fascinating nexus for understanding mechanisms underlying disorders of mind and movement. Although the risk of drug-induced extrapyramidal syndromes has been mitigated by the acceptance of less potent dopamine antagonists, expansive marketing and off-label use has increased the number of susceptible people who may be at risk for these neurologic effects. Clinicians need to be familiar with advances in diagnosis and management, which are reviewed herein. A better understanding of drug-induced effects on the motor circuit may improve patient safety, enhance antipsychotic effectiveness, and provide insights into mechanisms underlying antipsychotic activity in parallel brain circuits.

### Drug-induced dyskinesia in Parkinson's disease. should success in clinical management be a function of improvement of motor repertoire rather than amplitude of dyskinesia? [^114nz7Yu]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Why is managing dyskinesia as much art as science?

Due to the complex pathophysiology of dyskinesia, there has been considerable debate about which treatment is more efficacious for best symptom management while still avoiding motor complications. Several studies examined the incidence of dyskinesia with different medication (see for an extensive review). Here, we focus on possible treatment options when dyskinesia have already occurred. The primary option for clinicians is to reduce medication dosage; however, this can lead to the resurgence of typical parkinsonian symptoms. The second option is to fragment dosage, reducing each dose and increasing its frequency for more constant delivery as the pulsatile delivery of L-DOPA is, in part, responsible for the observed functional alterations within the basal ganglia. The use of controlled-release oral medication may limit this pulsatile effect. However, the efficacy of such controlled release drugs in treating dyskinesia is investigational at best and there is little evidence to suggest that they may delay the onset of dyskinesia. Nonetheless, the concept behind controlled-release formulations, that is, a more continuous delivery of medication rather than a pulsatile increase in medication normally observed with PD medication, has spurred the development of continuous drug delivery (CDD) systems such as mini-pump guided continuous apomorphine infusion, duodenal L-DOPA infusion (Duodopa), and transdermal delivery of rotigotine (dopamine agonist) through a patch. Several continuous drug delivery treatments are proposed as useful in reducing the incidence or treatment of dyskinesia, but there is insufficient evidence to characterize them as unequivocally effective. For example, a study on an animal model of PD demonstrated that continuous delivery of rotigotine did not induce dyskinesia and functional sensitization, whereas using an oral formulation at different intervals did. On the other hand, a pilot study on duodenal infusion of L-DOPA was shown to induce similar levels of dyskinesia as pulsatile delivery systems; however, once dyskinesia are present, switching to duodenal L-DOPA reduces the duration of dyskinesia. This highlights the variability in the effectiveness of these treatments. Furthermore, these approaches to dyskinesia treatment are limited due to the complexity of the procedure and the difficult long-term management of patients. Indeed, the invasive nature of some of these treatments limits the number of potential candidates; and the potential for severe complications requires adequate monitoring. Another option is to control dyskinesia by reducing the L-DOPA dose and introducing dopamine agonists. Again, this option is not without problems, including the lower efficacy of dopamine agonists in treating motor symptoms, as well as increasing the incidence of other disabling side effects such as somnolence, sleep attacks, dizziness, nausea, delusions, impulse control disorders, hallucinations and confusion. In addition, one must keep in mind that some studies have observed the appearance of dyskinesia with the use of dopamine agonists without the concomitant presence of L-DOPA.

### Antipsychotic dose, dopamine D2 receptor occupancy and extrapyramidal side-effects: a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis [^111EaoTy]. Molecular Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Extrapyramidal side-effects (EPS) or drug-induced movement disorders, such as parkinsonism, dystonia, akathisia, and tardive dyskinesia, are among the most common side-effects of antipsychotic medications that can be present in up to a third of people with schizophrenia. They can be stigmatizing and unpleasant, leading to nonadherence to treatment and the subsequent negative impacts. Moreover, they often require the use of adjunctive medications, such as anticholinergic medications, which could further increase the side-effect burden, e.g. cognitive impairment and constipation. Therefore, proper information about the risk of EPS associated with antipsychotic treatment is necessary.

The principal pathogenetic mechanism of antipsychotic-induced EPS is the blockade of the dopamine D 2 receptor (D 2 R) signalling in the nigrostriatal pathway. All current antipsychotics bind to the D 2 R, albeit with different affinities and receptor-binding profiles. According to the receptor occupancy theory, the D 2 R occupancy of an antipsychotic depends on its affinity to the D 2 R and the plasma concentration, which is associated with the administrated dose. Antipsychotic drugs typically reach maximum efficacy at doses corresponding to approximately 80% D 2 R occupancy, with higher doses beyond this threshold increasing the risk of EPS. However, the exact mechanism is more complex, and other receptors, including serotonin 5-HT 1A, 5-HT 2A, 5-HT 2c and muscarinic M 1 receptors, also play a role. Therefore, the risk of EPS varies among antipsychotics, with newer or "second-generation" antipsychotics generally having a lower risk.

While EPS may be dose-dependent, the dose-response curves remain unclear and can differ across medications. Additionally, while the above-mentioned D 2 R therapeutic window has been documented in molecular imaging studies, it has not yet been comprehensively evaluated in systematic reviews of clinical trials. To further elucidate these issues, we conducted a comprehensive systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis on antipsychotic-induced EPS.

### Drug-induced dyskinesia in Parkinson's disease. should success in clinical management be a function of improvement of motor repertoire rather than amplitude of dyskinesia? [^113vuv6s]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Summary

The treatment of PD requires the evaluation of several motor symptoms affecting the quality of life of patients. The limited number of movement disorders specialists and the increasing number of patients with PD places a toll on health-care systems world-wide. The need to develop and implement evidence-based medicine is urgent. In this review, we proposed a novel way to view the clinical management of motor symptoms in PD and more specifically of dyskinesia. While we acknowledge that this view requires further testing, we believe that systematizing the approach to the treatment of motor symptoms in PD will lead to an improvement in patient quality of life and, hopefully, a relief on our health-care system.

### Medical management and prevention of motor complications in Parkinson's disease [^116FHUvC]. Neurotherapeutics (2020). Medium credibility.

Another formulation, amantadine ER tablets (Osmolex ER™), is approved for the treatment of Parkinson's disease and drug-induced extrapyramidal reactions in adult patients. FDA approval was based on bioavailability studies comparing amantadine ER tablets to amantadine IR. To our knowledge, no clinical trials have specifically assessed the efficacy of amantadine ER tablets in the treatment of LID.

The most common side effects of amantadine include hallucinations, dizziness, dry mouth, peripheral edema, constipation, falls, and orthostatic hypotension.

Amantadine IR is often started at 50 mg or 100 mg daily and increased to a typical maintenance dose of 100 mg twice daily; total daily doses of 300 to 400 mg per day may be tried, but these doses are often limited by side effects. The initial daily dosage of amantadine ER capsules is 137 mg, administered orally once daily at bedtime. This can be increased after 1 week to the recommended dosage of 274 mg once daily at bedtime. The recommended initial dosage of amantadine ER tablets is 129 mg administered orally once daily in the morning, which can be increased in weekly intervals to a maximum daily dose of 322 mg (administered as a 129 mg and 193 mg tablet), taken in the morning. Amantadine is primarily renally cleared, requiring adjusted dosing in patients with impaired renal function, and is contraindicated in patients with end-stage renal disease.

### Trihexyphenidyl hydrochloride [^115DnwDX]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Trihexyphenidyl HCl in Drug-Induced Parkinsonism

The size and frequency of dose of trihexyphenidyl HCl needed to control extrapyramidal reactions to commonly employed tranquilizers, notably the phenothiazines, thioxanthenes, and butyrophenones, must be determined empirically. The total daily dosage usually ranges between 5 and 15 mg, although, in some cases, these reactions have been satisfactorily controlled on as little as 1 mg daily. It may be advisable to commence therapy with a single 1 mg dose. If the extrapyramidal manifestations are not controlled in a few hours, the subsequent doses may be progressively increased until satisfactory control is achieved. Satisfactory control may sometimes be more rapidly achieved by temporarily reducing the dosage of the tranquilizer on instituting trihexyphenidyl HCl therapy and then adjusting dosage of both drugs until the desired ataractic effect is retained without onset of extrapyramidal reactions.

It is sometimes possible to maintain the patient on a reduced trihexyphenidyl HCl dosage after the reactions have remained under control for several days. Instances have been reported in which these reactions have remained in remission for long periods after trihexyphenidyl HCl therapy was discontinued.

Concomitant Use of Trihexyphenidyl HCl with Levodopa

When trihexyphenidyl HCl is used concomitantly with levodopa, the usual dose of each may need to be reduced. Careful adjustment is necessary, depending on side effects and degree of symptom control. Trihexyphenidyl HCl dosage of 3 to 6 mg daily, in divided doses, is usually adequate.

Concomitant Use of Trihexyphenidyl HCl with Other Parasympathetic Inhibitors

Trihexyphenidyl HCl may be substituted, in whole or in part, for other parasympathetic inhibitors. The usual technique is partial substitution initially, with progressive reduction in the other medication as the dose of trihexyphenidyl HCl is increased.

Trihexyphenidyl Hydrochloride Tablets - The total daily intake of trihexyphenidyl HCl tablets is tolerated best if divided into 3 doses and taken at mealtimes. High doses (> 10 mg daily) may be divided into 4 parts, with 3 doses administered at meal times and the fourth at bedtime.

### Evidence-based initiation of dopaminergic therapy in Parkinson's disease [^1123EYjT]. Journal of Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

The mainstay of Parkinson's disease (PD) therapy is levodopa. The crucial question is when should levodopa be initiated? Levodopa provides the most potent motor benefit for PD, but longer term use is marked by the development of motor complications such as fluctuations in response and involuntary motor movements. Dopamine agonists reduce the risk of development of motor complications in the 5-year term. However, side effects may change the risk-benefit of dopamine agonist first strategies. In the following, the evidence for levodopa and dopamine agonists as initial monotherapy for PD is examined.

Risperidone adverse effects in dementia — dose-related parkinsonism and sedation — are reported with parkinsonism rates of 21%, 13%, and 7% in patients receiving 2 mg/day risperidone, 1 mg/day risperidone, and placebo, respectively; in another trial, parkinsonism incidence was 15% with risperidone at a mean endpoint dosage of 1.1 mg/day versus 11% with placebo, and in a third study parkinsonism was 2.3% with risperidone (mean dosage 0.95 mg/day) versus 16% with placebo; a meta-analysis found an overall odds ratio for extrapyramidal signs and symptoms of 1.80 (CI, 1.35–2.42) for risperidone versus placebo, and sedation affected 12% on risperidone versus 4.4% on placebo in one trial with the meta-analysis confirming increased sedation risk (odds ratio, 2.43; CI, 1.78–3.32); the meta-analysis also noted a higher rate of peripheral edema with risperidone, and risperidone may cause abnormal gait in some patients.

### Benztropine (benztropine mesylate) [^113s8YWW]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

Some patients experience greatest relief by taking the entire dose at bedtime; others react more favorably to divided doses, two to four times a day. Frequently, one dose a day is sufficient, and divided doses may be unnecessary or undesirable.

The long duration of action of this drug makes it particularly suitable for bedtime medication when its effects may last throughout the night, enabling patients to turn in bed during the night more easily, and to rise in the morning.

When benztropine mesylate is started, do not terminate therapy with other antiparkinsonian agents abruptly. If the other agents are to be reduced or discontinued, it must be done gradually. Many patients obtain greatest relief with combination therapy.

Benztropine mesylate may be used concomitantly with Carbidopa- Levodopa, or with levodopa, in which case periodic dosage adjustment may be required in order to maintain optimum response.

Drug-Induced Extrapyramidal Disorders – In treating extrapyramidal disorders due to neuroleptic drugs (e.g., phenothiazines), the recommended dosage is 1 to 4 mg once or twice a day orally. Dosage must be individualized according to the need of the patient. Some patients require more than recommended; others do not need as much.

When extrapyramidal disorders develop soon after initiation of treatment with neuroleptic drugs (e.g., phenothiazines), they are likely to be transient. One to 2 mg of benztropine mesylate tablets two or three times a day usually provides relief within one or two days. After one or two weeks the drug should be withdrawn to determine the continued need for it. If such disorders recur, benztropine mesylate can be reinstituted.

Certain drug-induced extrapyramidal disorders that develop slowly may not respond to benztropine mesylate.

### Levodopa in the treatment of Parkinson's disease [^116hQpby]. European Journal of Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

The predominant motor features of Parkinson's disease (PD) are caused by degeneration of dopaminergic neurones and can be reversed in part or whole by dopamine replacement or augmentation strategies. Physicians have most experience with the use of levodopa, which remains the most potent oral dopaminergic treatment for PD. There are reservations about the long-term use of levodopa, most particularly in the context of its propensity to induce motor fluctuations and dyskinesias. Strategies exist to delay or diminish these complications, but the physician must lay the basis for these in the selection of drugs for early treatment and the sequence of drugs introduced subsequently. Levodopa efficacy and duration of effect may be enhanced by combination with a catechol-O-methyl transferase inhibitor. Maintaining good motor function and quality of life remain the primary goals of therapy and the principle that treatment must be tailored to the individual patient's needs is paramount.

### Practice guideline recommendations summary: treatment of tics in people with tourette syndrome and chronic tic disorders [^114KxpMB]. Neurology (2019). High credibility.

Antipsychotic treatment for tics — efficacy, risks, dosing, and monitoring: Haloperidol, risperidone, aripiprazole, and tiapride are probably more likely than placebo to reduce tic severity, and pimozide, ziprasidone, and metoclopramide are possibly more likely than placebo to reduce tic severity; there is insufficient evidence to determine the relative efficacy of these drugs. Systematic reviews of trials and cohort studies demonstrate a higher risk of drug-induced movement disorders (including tardive dyskinesia, drug-induced parkinsonism, akathisia, acute dystonia, and tardive dystonia), weight gain, adverse metabolic side effects, prolactin increase, and QT prolongation with both first- and second-generation antipsychotics across psychiatric and neurologic conditions, and the relative propensity for these adverse effects varies by agent and is often dose-dependent. Physicians may prescribe antipsychotics for the treatment of tics when the benefits of treatment outweigh the risks (Level C), must counsel patients on the relative propensity of antipsychotics for extrapyramidal, hormonal, and metabolic adverse effects to inform decision-making on which antipsychotic should be prescribed (Level A), must prescribe the lowest effective dose to decrease the risk of adverse effects (Level A), and should monitor for drug-induced movement disorders and for metabolic and hormonal adverse effects of antipsychotics, using evidence-based monitoring protocols (Level B). Physicians have a duty to monitor the effectiveness and safety of prescribed medications, and evidence-based monitoring protocols are available, and abrupt discontinuation of antipsychotic medications can cause withdrawal dyskinesias.

Limitations

The analysis has certain limitations. First, we defined our primary outcome post-hoc as the number of participants receiving antiparkinsonian medications and used other proxies when data were not available. This decision was made in order to provide a comprehensive analysis and increase the power to estimate dose-response relationships. We gave preference to the use of antiparkinsonian medications as a measure of global EPS, as it was often used in previous analyses. We also prioritised dichotomous outcomes over scale-derived data due to skewness. In a sensitivity analysis comparing dichotomous to scale-derived data (by estimating ORs from SMDs), we found that effect sizes were generally smaller for the latter (eAppendix 7). This could be potentially attributed to skewness (e.g. large SDs may dilute SMDs) and/or the transient nature of EPS during the study, resulting in small mean changes from baseline to endpoint. A previous dose-response meta-analysis analysed only scale-derived data, which could also explain some of the differences in the findings with the current analysis.

Second, the term "EPS" is an umbrella term of heterogenous treatment-emergent movement disorders that could have different etiopathogeneses and require different treatments. Our study primarily focused on parkinsonism and other movement disorders that could be treated with anticholinergic medications. Thus, the findings cannot be directly extrapolated to akathisia and tardive dyskinesia that have different pathogenetic mechanisms and need for distinct interventions. For this reason, we conducted a separate dose-response meta-analysis on antipsychotic-induced akathisia, which revealed often but not always differing shapes of dose-response curves between akathisia and EPS. This may also be relevant for antipsychotics like aripiprazole that have a clinically-important risk of akathisia, albeit a generally small risk of EPS. In particular, we found that the risk of akathisia reached a plateau of OR = 1.8–2.0 at approximately 10–15 mg/d of aripiprazole, whereas the risk of EPS was trivial OR = 1.2–1.3 at these doses, but slightly increased up to OR = 1.57 at 30 mg/d (Fig. 2).

### Parkinsonism in the psychiatric setting: an update on clinical differentiation and management [^114nBSLA]. BMJ Neurology Open (2020). High credibility.

Parkinsonism is seen frequently in patients with psychiatric conditions. Drug-induced parkinsonism (DIP) is the second most common cause of parkinsonism in the general population after Parkinson's disease (PD) but a range of rarer aetiologies, some of them reversible, should also be considered in patients of all ages. DIP is more common in older patients, as are neurodegenerative diseases that may produce parkinsonism and it is relatively more likely that drug exposure could be unmasking an underlying process in this population. There is an extensive literature on differentiating DIP from PD but clinical features can be indistinguishable and many proposed investigations are not readily available. Aside from cessation of the responsible medication, there is no clear consensus on treatment strategies or duration of treatment. Practically, a delicate balance must be achieved between ameliorating parkinsonism and avoiding recurrent psychosis. Long-term prognosis in the setting of DIP remains unclear. We review the features that may differentiate DIP from other causes of parkinsonism in patients with psychiatric illness, provide an update on relevant investigations and discuss management strategies. The use of atypical antipsychotics for a broad range of indications highlights the ongoing relevance of DIP.

### Parkinsonism in the psychiatric setting: an update on clinical differentiation and management [^116Tn1NG]. BMJ Neurology Open (2020). High credibility.

Parkinsonism is seen frequently in patients with psychiatric conditions. Drug-induced parkinsonism (DIP) is the second most common cause of parkinsonism in the general population after Parkinson's disease (PD) but a range of rarer aetiologies, some of them reversible, should also be considered in patients of all ages. DIP is more common in older patients, as are neurodegenerative diseases that may produce parkinsonism and it is relatively more likely that drug exposure could be unmasking an underlying process in this population. There is an extensive literature on differentiating DIP from PD but clinical features can be indistinguishable and many proposed investigations are not readily available. Aside from cessation of the responsible medication, there is no clear consensus on treatment strategies or duration of treatment. Practically, a delicate balance must be achieved between ameliorating parkinsonism and avoiding recurrent psychosis. Long-term prognosis in the setting of DIP remains unclear. We review the features that may differentiate DIP from other causes of parkinsonism in patients with psychiatric illness, provide an update on relevant investigations and discuss management strategies. The use of atypical antipsychotics for a broad range of indications highlights the ongoing relevance of DIP.

### Dopaminergic therapy for motor symptoms in early parkinson disease practice guideline summary: a report of the AAN guideline subcommittee [^1172Vdg5]. Neurology (2021). High credibility.

Practice recommendations for initiation of pharmacologic treatment for motor symptoms in early Parkinson disease (PD) are contextualized by the statement that there are no disease-modifying drugs and therapy is symptomatic only, and by observational data on treatment timing. The document states, "There are no current disease-modifying pharmacologic treatments for PD; current PD pharmacologic therapy is symptomatic only". When symptoms are not causing disability, "most individuals with PD and clinicians are comfortable with a "wait and see" approach, although this requires careful monitoring and advising patients not to tolerate disability or put them in a situation of living unnecessarily". In the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative dataset, among those expected to remain untreated for at least 6 months, 283 (67%) individuals with idiopathic PD started treatment within 2 years of study onset, with an average time of 0.78 (SD 0.5) years after study entry. The panel also "developed rationale statements that precede each recommendation" and specifies that "Four types of premises can be used to support recommendations: (1) evidence-based conclusions from the systematic review, (2) generally accepted principles of care, (3) strong evidence from related conditions, and (4) reasonable inferences from other premises. Recommendations must always be supported by at least one premise".

### Treatment interventions for Parkinson's disease: an evidence based assessment [^1122Du5X]. Lancet (2002). Excellent credibility.

We did a systematic review, with a uniform method of assessment of efficacy and safety, to assess the different interventions available for the management of Parkinson's disease (drugs, surgical interventions, and physical treatments) with respect to the following indications: prevention of disease progression, symptomatic treatment of motor features (parkinsonism), symptomatic control of motor complications, prevention of motor complications, and symptomatic treatment of non-motor features. Our aim was not to define practice guidelines, but rather to improve clinicians' knowledge of the presently available published clinical evidence, based mainly on randomised controlled trials. We hope that our review will help doctors to incorporate this background into their own decision-making strategy to make appropriate choices with respect to the treatment of individual patients with Parkinson's disease.

### Appropriate dosing of pergolide in monotherapy and adjunctive therapy in Parkinson's disease [^116rHddx]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2003). Low credibility.

Pergolide is one of the most well-tested and widely used dopamine agonists for the treatment of Parkinson's disease; however, there is worrying evidence that sub-therapeutic dosing of pergolide is widespread in clinical practice. Clinical studies in Caucasians suggest that a pergolide dose of 3 mg/day provides the optimal efficacy to tolerability ratio and that, in Japanese patients, a dose in excess of 2.25 mg/day may be ideal. Whether pergolide is used early in patients with de-novo Parkinson's disease or as adjunctive therapy later in the disease, in order to optimize its clinical efficacy, it is recommended that practitioners aim to achieve at least these doses, or higher ones, if the drug is well tolerated.

Somatic pharmacotherapy considerations for elderly patients with dementia emphasize that medications are effective for some symptoms but must be used with caution in this patient population [I], that age-related pharmacokinetic changes may increase sensitivity and patients with dementia may be more likely to experience anticholinergic effects, orthostasis, sedation, and parkinsonism, and that symptoms of dementia may compromise adherence; consequently, low starting doses, small dose increases, long intervals between increments, and ensuring a system to enhance proper medication adherence may be needed [I].

### Dopaminergic therapy for motor symptoms in early parkinson disease practice guideline summary: a report of the AAN guideline subcommittee [^111Pc2b6]. Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

To review the current evidence on the options available for initiating dopaminergic treatment of motor symptoms in early-stage Parkinson disease and provide recommendations to clinicians.

Methods

A multidisciplinary panel developed practice recommendations, integrating findings from a systematic review and following an Institute of Medicine-compliant process to ensure transparency and patient engagement. Recommendations were supported by structured rationales, integrating evidence from the systematic review, related evidence, principles of care, and inferences from evidence.

Results

Initial treatment with levodopa provides superior motor benefit compared to treatment with dopamine agonists, whereas levodopa is more likely than dopamine agonists to cause dyskinesia. The comparison of different formulations of dopamine agonists yielded little evidence that any one formulation or method of administration is superior. Long-acting forms of levodopa and levodopa with entacapone do not appear to differ in efficacy from immediate-release levodopa for motor symptoms in early disease. There is a higher risk of impulse control disorders associated with the use of dopamine agonists than levodopa. Recommendations on initial therapy for motor symptoms are provided to assist the clinician and patient in choosing between treatment options and to guide counseling, prescribing, and monitoring of efficacy and safety.

### Drug-induced dyskinesia in Parkinson's disease. should success in clinical management be a function of improvement of motor repertoire rather than amplitude of dyskinesia? [^112ixvkQ]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

The aforementioned data on PD fits well with issues facing clinicians. Indeed, any reduction in dyskinesia levels could lead to increased typical parkinsonian motor symptoms. Accordingly, clinicians may be replacing one kind of noise with another one (this concept is illustrated in Figure 2).

Figure 2
Two examples to illustrate opposite results following drug regimen change. In situation 1, a change in drug regimen decreased dyskinesia amplitude which then led to increased signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) (dark grey lines), and consequently increased motor repertoire. In situation 2, the same change in drug regimen also led to a reduction of dyskinesia amplitude. However, there is resurgence of typical motor symptoms associated with PD, thus increasing the noise, which will induce a decrease of overall SNR, hence a reduction in the motor repertoire (light grey lines). Here, the patient did not benefit from the reduction of dyskinesia, as his/her motor repertoire worsened. These examples illustrate the challenges faced by clinicians when managing dyskinesia. PD, Parkinson's disease.

To better illustrate this theory, we present below two hypothetical situations that could be encountered in clinical practice (Figure 2).

Situation 1: the clinician reduces L-DOPA or dopamine agonist dosage and the level of dyskinesia is reduced. This results in an increased motor repertoire because of the increased SNR. Dyskinesia management is effective and should be pursued.

Situation 2: the clinician reduces medication dosage and the level of dyskinesia is reduced, but leads to a reduction in motor repertoire. As such, the dyskinesia portion of the noise is reduced but is accompanied by an increase in noise associated with typical parkinsonian symptoms present when medication is lacking, such as bradykinesia or rigidity. Here, the treatment regimen should be modified until situation 1 is achieved. If situation 1 cannot be achieved, it may be that having some dyskinesia is the preferred solution since the motor repertoire is greater with dyskinesia, as discussed by our group and others. Surgery may be considered as an alternative in this case because, as mentioned above, it may control dyskinesia possibly through a reduction in medication. The aforementioned approach would seem logical to movement disorders specialists, but may be more difficult to implement by less experienced clinicians treating patients with PD experiencing motor fluctuations.

### Treatment initiation for Parkinson's disease in Australia 2013–2018: a nation-wide study [^113X2DUg]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This is the first national study to report the patterns of treatment initiation for PD in Australia. Overall initiation with levodopa remained stable from 2013 to 2018, whereas initiation with non-ergot DAs increased and anticholinergics decreased. Women were more likely to initiate treatment with non-ergot DAs than men. Non-ergot DAs were preferred over levodopa as initial medication in women aged < 65 years after 2014, whereas levodopa was preferred among men aged < 65 and ≥ 65 years throughout the study period.

Our finding that levodopa was preferred as initial therapy among persons aged ≥ 65 years is consistent with guidelines. There is no Australian National Health and Medical Research Council guideline for the treatment of PD. However, the widely used Therapeutic Guidelines: Neurology recommend levodopa due to the favourable benefit-to-risk ratio, particularly for persons aged > 70 years or with cognitive impairment. Among persons aged < 65 years, the initial choice varied between levodopa and non-ergot DAs during the five years. Similarly, DAs were preferred as initial medication among persons aged < 60 years in Finland in 2005 and 2012. Although not directly recommended in the Therapeutic Guidelines, initiation with DA in younger persons is consistent with international clinical guidelines, with a view to avoiding or delaying levodopa-induced motor complications.

We identified different treatment approaches among men and women despite this not being recommended in guidelines. Levodopa-induced dyskinesias and milder initial symptoms are more likely among women, which could explain why DAs were preferred among women. In addition, differences in predominant symptoms, individual life circumstances, preferences, and physician's attitudes could affect the treatment choice. However, PBS data did not permit analyses of these factors in our study. A recent study from the United States found women had delayed treatment initiation and longer time to treatment switches and add-on than men. Men also use higher levodopa equivalent doses than women but this may reflect dosage adjustment according to patient's body weight and symptoms. Our findings are similar to an Israeli study that found men aged 75–84 years had higher rate of levodopa initiation than women and younger men aged 50–74 years had higher rates of MAO-B inhibitor use than younger women. Contrary to our findings, older men had higher rates of DA use compared to older women. Further studies are needed to establish the generalizability of our findings to other populations, and to investigate the reasons for and outcomes of preferential initiation with DAs among women.

### Movement disorders in psychiatric patients [^117ELhSZ]. BMJ Neurology Open (2020). High credibility.

Drug-induced parkinsonism

Drug-induced parkinsonism is at first face the easiest of these movement disorders to understand, with blockade of nigrostriatal dopaminergic transmission mimicking the effects of nigral cell degeneration in PD. Yet the situation is not so straightforward. Once the causative agent has been stopped, clinical improvement occurs with a lag time of months, well after the pharmacological dopamine receptor block should have disappeared. Marsden thought that patients sometimes took as long as 18 months to start to improve, and as long as 5 years to recover completely.

Estimates of the prevalence of drug-induced parkinsonism vary. One population study detected it in 36% of subjects treated with neuroleptic drugs for more than 6 months. Then, there are observations that can be made in any inpatient psychiatric service. Most patients presenting with psychotic illness, once titrated to an effective dose of antipsychotic treatment, develop a degree of blankness of facial expression, woodenness of movement or dampening of arm swing when walking. These impressions support the notion that D2 dopamine receptor blockade is an important determinant of the effectiveness of this drug therapy.

Clinically, drug-induced parkinsonism is a little less likely to be asymmetrical than the idiopathic disease. Normal dopamine transporter scans discriminate drug-induced parkinsonism from idiopathic PD, and this accounts for 60% of cases. The other 40% appear to have some sort of presynaptic dopamine deficiency. Unmasking of incipient idiopathic PD by pharmacological dopamine receptor antagonism is one explanation, yet this subgroup of drug-induced parkinsonism seems to exceed the natural prevalence of PD, and limited clinicopathological studies do not disclose a great deal of Lewy body pathology. Chronic dopamine receptor blockade increases the firing rate and metabolic activity of dopaminergic nigral neurons. Consequent depolarization blockor structural neuronal damageare possible reasons for delayed recovery after drug withdrawal. Despite theoretical risks of exacerbating psychosis, levodopa is generally well tolerated as a treatment when cessation of antipsychotic medication is impractical. Patients with abnormal dopamine transporter scans may be more responsive.

### American psychiatric association practice guideline for the treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. second edition [^1112H83F]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Parkinson's disease spectrum illnesses (including Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies) — management priorities include monitoring, psychosis risk, and selective pharmacotherapy. The cognitive impairment associated with Parkinson's disease and related illnesses requires a broad treatment approach that targets both cognitive and noncognitive neuropsychiatric symptoms, and mild cognitive impairment may be partially ameliorated by dopaminergic agents prescribed for motor symptoms, so both cognitive and motor symptoms should be carefully monitored. Because dopaminergic agents predispose patients to visual hallucinations and other psychotic phenomena, especially in patients with dementia, these agents should be used with particular care, and the minimal dosage needed to control motor symptoms should be prescribed. Patients are vulnerable to delirium from medications and concomitant general medical conditions; therefore, development of these symptoms deserves thorough evaluation. Pharmacological and behavioral interventions have been shown to have beneficial effects for specific patients, but strong evidence guiding agent selection is lacking. Clinical trials have demonstrated efficacy of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors on cognition in dementia with Lewy bodies and dementia with Parkinson's disease with effects similar to those seen in Alzheimer's disease. For noncognitive neuropsychiatric symptoms in dementia with Lewy bodies, if psychotic symptoms result in distress or danger, the judicious use of an antipsychotic agent, often at low doses, is indicated; although all antipsychotic agents can aggravate Parkinsonian motor disturbances and open-label data support second-generation antipsychotics, because antipsychotics can dramatically worsen dementia with Lewy bodies, they should be prescribed very cautiously. Depression is common in Parkinson's disease and may exacerbate functional impairment or be misinterpreted as dementia; data supporting psychotherapy or antidepressants are modest, but clinical experience supports their use.

### Drug-induced psychotic symptoms in Parkinson's disease. problems, management and dilemma [^113EEmqe]. Journal of Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

Psychotic symptoms develop in 20–30% of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) receiving chronic anti-PD medications, and visual hallucinations with or without delirium and paranoid delusions are the most frequent symptoms. Psychotic symptoms disturb ADL and QOL of PD patients and tax caregivers far more than the motor disabilities do, and good management of drug-induced psychotic symptoms is potentially important. Withdrawal of anti-PD drugs relieves the patients from psychotic side effects, but worsens the parkinsonian motor symptoms. The first step of treatment is to eliminate triggering factors other than anti-PD drugs, such as infections, metabolic disorders, subdural hematoma, and hallucinogenic drugs. The second step is to eliminate anti-PD drugs in the following order; first anticholinergics, amantadine and selegiline, second dopamine agonists, and finally levodopa/carbidopa. Anti-PD medications should be reduced to the point of improving psychotic side effects without drastically worsening parkinsonian motor symptoms. When the above adjustments fail to sufficiently alleviate psychotic side effects, the third step is consideration of antipsychotic drugs although they have potential capacity to antagonize dopamine D2 receptors and worsen parkinsonism. Atypical antipsychotics such as clozapine and olanzapine are recommended, though the former is not available in Japan.

Recommendation 4 — dopamine agonist (DA) selection and dosing in early Parkinson disease (PD): Clinicians should integrate patient preferences regarding formulation, dosing frequency, and route, including options such as "once daily, twice daily, or 3 times daily" and "oral vs transdermal", and may start at the lowest possible dosage and increase slowly, stopping at the lowest dosage recognized to have clinical efficacy (6–9 mg/day of ropinirole, 1.5 mg/day of pramipexole, or 4 mg/24 hours of rotigotine). Consistent with this approach, "Clinicians should integrate patient preferences concerning formulation, mode of administration, and cost when prescribing a DA (Level B)" and "Clinicians should prescribe the lowest dose of DA required to provide therapeutic benefit (Level B)".

### Drug interactions in the treatment of Parkinson's disease [^111Fj9Mv]. Journal of Neurology (2002). Low credibility.

In recent years, the antiparkinsonian drug regime has become increasingly complicated. A wide range of antiparkinson agents is meanwhile available. Combination therapies may unfortunately induce interactions up to the point of life-threatening events. The potential of drug-drug interactions must be taken into account before starting a patient on combination treatment. Moreover, the frequent multimorbidity of patients with Parkinson's disease necessitates the application of additional drugs. A general overview is difficult to maintain because of the countless number of possible interactions. Cautious proceeding is certainly indicated in particular cases. The most common interactions will be discussed below. We should bear in mind that many of the interactions related to drug combinations are unknown yet.

### Parkinsonism in the psychiatric setting: an update on clinical differentiation and management [^114cnpwS]. BMJ Neurology Open (2020). High credibility.

Management strategies

The treatment of parkinsonism in the psychiatric setting should be individualised, considering varied vulnerabilities and priorities for medication use. Where DIP is a potential cause of parkinsonism, withdrawing or changing potentially responsible medications is the first step.DIP usually resolves within months of stopping the offending drug but parkinsonism may persist or progress in 10%–50%. While, unmasking of subclinical PD should be considered in this population, parkinsonism has been reported to persist for up to 18 months in some cases of DIP.

Despite medication withdrawal, patients can be significantly disabled by motor symptoms which may take time to resolve. There is also a risk of unmasking or exacerbating tardive dyskinesia with reduction or cessation of antipsychotics. Older and anecdotal evidence exists for the use of anticholinergic agents such as benztropine and levodopa in the symptomatic management of DIP, although it is not robust. Anticholinergic medications may also worsen concomitant tardive dyskinesia and amantadine has been proposed as a treatment option in this circumstance.

Where antipsychotic medication is necessary, lowering the dose or switching to an antipsychotic with a lower risk of DIP such as quetiapine or clozapine is an alternative. Quetiapine is relatively safe in patients with parkinsonism and widely used for PD psychosis but has limited evidence for efficacy. Clozapine should be used judiciously given the potential for serious haematological and cardiac adverse reactions but, with adequate monitoring, is an effective treatment for psychosiswith low risk for both parkinsonism and tardive dyskinesia. The increased mortality associated with antipsychotic use in older patients should also be carefully considered.

Pimavanserin, a serotonin receptor inverse agonist shown to reduce psychotic symptoms in PD without worsening of motor symptoms, is not available for use in all countries.

If psychosis is secondary to a synucleinopathy such as PD or DLB, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors can be considered. Although not adequate for severe psychosis and with potentially limited approved indications, these agents can be antipsychotic sparing and have some evidence in PD psychosis.

In those with a primary psychiatric disorder, for whom electroconvulsive therapy can be prescribed, it has been shown to improve motor symptoms in both DIP and PD.

### Cabergoline versus bromocriptine for levodopa-induced complications in Parkinson's disease [^115URh1T]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Long term levodopa therapy in Parkinson's disease is associated with the development of motor complications including abnormal involuntary movements and a shortening response to each dose (wearing off phenomenon). It is thought that dopamine agonists can reduce the duration of immobile off periods and the need for levodopa therapy whilst maintaining or improving motor impairments and only minimally increasing dopaminergic adverse events.

Objectives

To compare the efficacy and safety of adjuvant cabergoline therapy versus bromocriptine in patients with Parkinson's disease, already established on levodopa and suffering from motor complications.

Search Strategy

Electronic searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register. Handsearching of the neurology literature as part of the Cochrane Movement Disorders Group's strategy. Examination of the reference lists of identified studies and other reviews. Contact with Pharmacia Upjohn Limited.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of cabergoline versus bromocriptine in patients with a clinical diagnosis of idiopathic Parkinson's disease and long-term complications of levodopa therapy.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were abstracted independently by the authors and differences settled by discussion. The outcome measures used included Parkinson's disease rating scales, levodopa dosage, off time measurements and the frequency of withdrawals and adverse events.

Main Results

Cabergoline has been compared with bromocriptine in five randomised, double-blind, parallel group studies including 1071 patients. Only one of the phase II studies was medium term (36 weeks), the others all being short term (12–15 weeks). The non-significant difference in off time reduction produced by cabergoline compared with bromocriptine was 0.29 hours/day in favour of the former (weighted mean difference; 95% CI -0.10, 0.68; p = 0.15). Dyskinesia reported as an adverse event was significantly increased with cabergoline compared with bromocriptine (Peto odds ratio 1.57; 95% CI 1.05, 2.35; p = 0.03). Motor impairment and disability were measured in four of the studies using the UPDRS rating scale but the small differences in UPDRS ADL (part II) and motor (part III) scores were not statistically significant in any study. Similarly, no significant difference in Schwab and England score was seen. The number of patients rated as much or very much improved on a clinician's global impression scale was similar with both agonists. Levodopa dose reduction was no different between cabergoline and bromocriptine. There was more confusion with cabergoline (Peto odds ratio 2.02; 95% CI 1.09, 3.76; p = 0.03). Otherwise, dopaminergic adverse events were comparable with these agonists and no significant difference in all cause withdrawal rate was found.

Reviewer's Conclusions

Cabergoline produces similar benefits to bromocriptine in off time reduction, motor impairment and disability ratings, and levodopa dose reduction over the first three months of therapy. Dyskinesia and confusion were increased with cabergoline but otherwise the frequency of adverse events and withdrawals from treatment were similar with the two agonists.

### AFQ056 in parkinson patients with levodopa-induced dyskinesia: 13-week, randomized, dose-finding study [^111AwXUZ]. Movement Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

AFQ056 is a novel, selective metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 antagonist. This was a 13-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Patients with Parkinson's disease and moderate-to-severe levodopa (l-dopa)-induced dyskinesia who were receiving stable l-dopa/anti-parkinsonian treatment and were not currently receiving amantadine were randomized to receive either AFQ056 (at doses of 20, 50, 100, 150, or 200 mg daily) or placebo (1:1:1:1:2:3 ratio) for 12 weeks. The primary outcome was the modified Abnormal Involuntary Movements Scale. Secondary outcomes included the 26-item Parkinson's Disease Dyskinesia Scale, the Patient's/Clinician's Global Impression of Change, and the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale parts III (motor evaluation) and IV (severity of motor complications). Safety was assessed. In total, 98 of 133 (73.7%) AFQ056-treated patients and 47 of 64 (73.4%) patients in the placebo group completed the study. Baseline characteristics were comparable. Patients randomized to AFQ056 200 mg daily administered in 2 doses demonstrated significant improvements at Week 12 on the modified Abnormal Involuntary Movements Scale compared with placebo (difference, -2.8; 95% confidence interval [CI] -5.2, -0.4; P = 0.007). Based on final actual doses, there was a dose-response relationship on the modified Abnormal Involuntary Movements Scale, with 200 mg daily demonstrating the most robust effect (difference, -3.6; 95% CI, -7.0, -0.3; P = 0.012). Improvements in dyskinesia were supported by change on Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale part IV item 32 (50 mg daily: difference, -0.7; 95% CI, -1.1, -0.2; P = 0.003; 200 mg daily: difference, -0.5; 95% CI, -0.8, -0.1; P = 0.005). No significant changes were observed on the 26-item Parkinson's Disease Dyskinesia Scale, the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale part IV item 33 or items 32 and 33, or the Patient's/Clinician's Global Impression of Change. Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale part III scores were not significantly changed, indicating no worsening of motor symptoms. The most common adverse events (with incidence greater with AFQ056 than with placebo) were dizziness, hallucination, fatigue, nasopharyngitis, diarrhea, and insomnia. AFQ056 demonstrated anti-dyskinetic efficacy in this population without worsening underlying motor symptoms. These results will guide dose selection for future clinical trials.

### Medical management and prevention of motor complications in Parkinson's disease [^112YNFnZ]. Neurotherapeutics (2020). Medium credibility.

Levodopa is the most effective medication for the treatment of the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease. However, over time, the clinical response to levodopa becomes complicated by a reduction in the duration and reliability of motor improvement (motor fluctuations) and the emergence of involuntary movements (levodopa-induced dyskinesia). Strategies that have been attempted in an effort to delay the development of these motor complications include levodopa sparing and continuous dopaminergic therapy. Once motor complications occur, a wide array of medical treatments is available to maximize motor function through the day while limiting dyskinesia. Here, we review the clinical features, epidemiology, and risk factors for the development of motor complications, as well as strategies for their prevention and medical management.

### Antipsychotic medications and drug-induced movement disorders other than parkinsonism: a population-based cohort study in older adults [^1164wwim]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2005). Low credibility.

Objectives

To study the relationship between initiating therapy with an antipsychotic medication and a subsequent new diagnosis of a drug-induced movement disorder other than parkinsonism in older adults with dementia.

Design

Retrospective, population-based cohort study.

Setting

Ontario, Canada.

Participants

Ontario residents aged 66 and older with a diagnosis of dementia newly started on treatment with typical or atypical antipsychotic therapy.

Measurement

Estimated relative risk of developing a drug-induced movement other than parkinsonism in the 1-year follow-up period after starting therapy with an antipsychotic medication.

Results

From April 1, 1997, to March 31, 2001, 21, 835 older adults with dementia who were newly started on antipsychotic medications were identified. Nine thousand seven hundred ninety subjects were started on atypical antipsychotics and 12,045 subjects started on typical antipsychotics. Demographic characteristics were similar between the groups. There were 5.24 cases of tardive dyskinesia (TD) or other drug-induced movement disorder per 100 person-years on therapy with a typical antipsychotic and 5.19 cases per 100 person-years on therapy with an atypical antipsychotic. The risk of developing drug-induced movement disorder while being treated with an atypical agent was not statistically different from that with a typical antipsychotic (relative risk = 0.99, 95% confidence interval = 0.86–1.15; P < .93).

Conclusion

Older adults with dementia who are treated with typical or atypical antipsychotic therapy are at risk for developing TD and other drug-induced movement disorders.

### Clozapine in drug induced psychosis in Parkinson's disease: a randomised, placebo controlled study with open follow up [^111EKwxz]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the efficacy and safety of clozapine in drug induced psychosis in Parkinson's disease (PD).

Methods

A four week, randomised, double blind, parallel comparison of clozapine and placebo, followed by a 12 week clozapine open period, plus a one month period after drug discontinuation, in 60 patients with PD. The primary efficacy outcome was the "clinical global impression scale" (CGI); the positive subscore of the "positive and negative syndrome scale" (PANSS) was used as the secondary efficacy parameter and the "unified Parkinson's disease rating scale" (UPDRS) and the "mini mental test examination" (MMSE) as safety outcomes.

Results

The mean (SD) dosage of clozapine was 35.8 (12.5–50) mg at the end of the double blind period. The mean (SD) scores on the CGI improved by 1.8 (1.5) for the clozapine group compared with 0.6 (1.1) for the placebo group (p = 0.001). The mean (SD) positive subscore of PANSS improved by 5.6 (3.9) for the clozapine group (0.8 (2.8) for the placebo group; p < 0.0001). At the end of the open period, 25 patients had completely recovered from delusions and hallucinations, and 19 experienced a relapse within one month after the clozapine washout period. The UPDRS motor and MMSE mean scores did not change significantly in either group. Somnolence was more frequent with clozapine than with placebo.

Conclusions

Clozapine at a mean dose lower than 50 mg/day improves drug induced psychosis in PD without significant worsening of motor function, and the effect wears off once the treatment stops.

### Tetrabenazine therapy of pediatric hyperkinetic movement disorders [^114qa9GR]. Movement Disorders (2006). Low credibility.

Tetrabenazine (TBZ), a presynaptic dopamine depletor and postsynaptic dopamine receptor blocker, is widely used for the treatment of hyperkinetic movement disorders in adults. However, reports of its use in children are limited. We review the efficacy and tolerability of TBZ therapy in 31 children with hyperkinetic movement disorders refractory to other medications. TBZ was effective in reducing the severity of movement disorders resistant to treatment with other medicines. When compared to adult patients, pediatric patients required higher doses. Side effects were similar to the adult population; however, children had a lower incidence of drug-induced Parkinsonism.

### Update of the European Society of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care medicine evidence-based and consensus-based guideline on postoperative delirium in adult patients [^115a1k2N]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Regarding the benefits and harms of haloperidol or other antipsychotics for delirium therapy, it is uncertain if there are clear benefits, and the risk of undesired side effects remains. Delirium is a complex disorder, and there is no single drug intervention that plausibly could treat all cases of delirium. Therefore, the concept of a drug treatment for delirium as a whole is flawed. However, in some circumstances, the use of antipsychotics might provide some benefit. There is no clear evidence for this, but expert consensus from published guidelines and standards supports limited use of antipsychotics only for severe distress particularly in the context of psychosis, and/or if hyperactivity and/or agitation is causing significant safety concerns when nonpharmacological interventions have been insufficiently effective or if the indication is urgent. We advise a short-term, symptom-oriented therapy. The application should be bolus-wise and with the lowest dose (suggestion on the initial dose in the elderly: 0.125 to 0.25 mg haloperidol): especially in elderly patients, who are considered being at particular risk of developing delirium after surgery and in which the sedative effect of antipsychotics predominates.

Antipsychotic drugs should be used with caution or not at all in patients with certain preexisting neurologic conditions, such as Parkinson's disease or Lewy bodies dementia.

PICO 17: Should benzodiazepines be used for the treatment of POD?

Benzodiazepines act at the γ-aminobutyric acid receptor (GABA-A) and mediate via anxiolytic, amnesic, sedative and anticonvulsant effects via various subunits. In some hospitals, benzodiazepines are still an integral part of sedation in ICUs and are used routinely to treat agitation and other symptoms. Dependence can occur even at therapeutic doses and carries the risk of developing withdrawal symptoms. Benzodiazepines often have active metabolites with a greater half-life than the basic substance itself, which increases the risk of accumulation, especially in patients with organ dysfunction requiring intensive care. Midazolam, in particular, is associated with a risk of accumulation because of its poor controllability. The certainty of the evidence for the use of benzodiazepines in treatment strategies for POD was very low to nonexistent. In the studies analysed here, there was only one RCT using benzodiazepines for the treatment of POD. Its efficacy was lower compared with alpha-2 agonists.

Therefore, a symptom-orientated medication is essential in a bolus-titrated dosage, as low as possible.

### Drug-induced dyskinesia in Parkinson's disease. should success in clinical management be a function of improvement of motor repertoire rather than amplitude of dyskinesia? [^116zwQVm]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

What are the main issues with current treatments?

Long-term use of dopamimetic agents, in combination with continued dopaminergic denervation, can generate dyskinesia. Indeed, while dyskinesia are mainly associated with functional alterations within the basal ganglia pathways related to prolonged exposure to L-DOPA, dopamine agonists and DBS can also cause the appearance of dyskinesia. The exact mechanism underlying dopamine agonist- or DBS-induced dyskinesia is still under investigation, but it is believed to stem from maladaptive mechanisms related to dopaminergic and glutamatergic systems (see for review). Patients receiving intra-striatal dopaminergic neural grafts can also experience dyskinesia, also without the presence of exogenous dopaminergic agents (off-dyskinesia), possibly due to inappropriate responses to dopamine release by grafted neurons.

There are several different classifications or types of dyskinesia, such as dystonic, ballistic, choreic and myoclonic, which can be monophasic or bi-phasic, occurring at different times in relation to administration of dopaminergic medication. The most common dyskinesia remain the monophasic choreic type, which are involuntary movements that occur at peak-dose and are considered to be purposeless, non-rhythmic, abrupt, rapid, irregular and un-sustained. We have recently provided the first characterization of the movement patterns of monophasic choreic dyskinesia based on quantitative measures of whole-body movements which highlight their complexity, and variability in amplitude and location over short periods of time. This might explain the relative difficulty of patients to control or compensate for their dyskinesia while attempting to either plan or execute everyday motor activities.

Several risk factors are associated with the occurrence of dyskinesia including age of onset of PD, body weight, disease duration, and the level of exposure to L-DOPA. A necessary factor in the development of dyskinesia appears to be the combination of dopaminergic denervation and long-term exposure to dopamine replacement therapy that promotes changes in the receptor environment and results in an altered clinical response to dopamine. Under physiological conditions, striatal and synaptic dopamine levels are maintained at a relatively constant level. The dopaminergic denervation observed in PD, in association with the administration of L-DOPA at intervals during the day, induces oscillations in the concentration of striatal and synaptic dopamine levels. This pulsatile stimulation of dopaminergic receptor is associated with functional changes within the basal ganglia, which results in altered neural activity in the basal ganglia, thalamus and cerebral cortex with associated involuntary movements.

### Evidence-based guideline update: treatment of essential tremor: report of the quality standards subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology [^115AoApJ]. Neurology (2011). Medium credibility.

Essential tremor (ET) — clinical context notes that flunarizine use may result in development of movement disorders including akathisia, dyskinesia, dystonia, and parkinsonism, and as an atypical neuroleptic agent, olanzapine can induce parkinsonism, with a review of 11 published studies in patients with PD reporting worsening parkinsonism in 64 of 145 patients (44%), though this side effect was not observed in the study of patients with ET. Class I evidence supports the successful use of primidone and propranolol in ET treatment, yet in a survey of 223 patients, 70.9% had taken primidone or propranolol and 56.3% had discontinued one or both medications.

### Incidence and time trends of drug-induced parkinsonism: a 30-year population-based study [^112nAmF2]. Movement Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

Diagnostic Criteria

Our diagnostic criteria included two steps: the definition of parkinsonism as a syndrome and the definition of the type of parkinsonism within the syndrome. Parkinsonism was defined as the presence of at least two of four cardinal signs: rest tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity, and impaired postural reflexes. 3, 8 DIP was defined as parkinsonism with the following three characteristics: (1) symptom onset within 6 months of treatment with dopamine‐blocking or dopamine‐depleting drugs; (2) no parkinsonism symptoms before treatment; and (3) resolution of symptoms within 6 months of withdrawal of treatment (for patients who never discontinued treatment, criteria 1 and 2 were sufficient for inclusion). 8 We limited the study to only dopamine‐active drugs for three reasons: (1) Parkinsonism linked to other drug classes appears to be extremely rare; (2) antidopaminergic drugs have a plausible mechanism for inducing parkinsonism; and (3) individual cases of parkinsonism associated with other drugs would be much more likely to have alternative causes and would be more difficult to adjudicate.

Reliability and Validity of Diagnosis and Classification

The case‐finding procedures for parkinsonism were valid and reliable as described more extensively elsewhere. 3, 8 In brief, an independent records review by the two movement disorders specialists who applied the same diagnostic criteria (J.H.B. and R.S.) showed 90.0% agreement on the presence of parkinsonism and 70.0% agreement on the exclusion of parkinsonism (kappa = 0.60; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.31–0.89; sample classified by R.S. as 30 patients with parkinsonism and 10 persons free of parkinsonism from the 1991–2005 time interval). 3 In general, agreement for the year of onset of parkinsonism was also high (intraclass correlation coefficient ICC = 0.85; 95% CI: 0.77–0.92). 3

### American psychiatric association practice guideline for the treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. second edition [^116z1MqW]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Implementation of pharmacological treatments in elderly patients with dementia states that low starting doses, small dose increases, and long intervals between dose increases are necessary, although some patients may ultimately need doses as high as would be appropriate for younger patients. Anticholinergic side effects may also lead to worsening cognitive impairment, confusion, or even delirium, orthostasis is common in elderly patients, and medications associated with central nervous system sedation may worsen cognition, increase the risk of falls, and put patients with sleep apnea at risk for additional respiratory depression; elderly patients with Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, or dementia with Lewy bodies are especially susceptible to extrapyramidal side effects. For all these reasons, medications should be used with considerable care, and polypharmacy should be avoided whenever possible, and in nonemergency situations or when neuropsychiatric symptoms are not severe, nonpharmacological approaches should be attempted first to avoid the very significant morbidities associated with psychotropic medication use in elderly patients.

Dementia-related psychosis and agitation — antipsychotic efficacy: First-generation antipsychotics have modest benefit over placebo across "seven double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, parallel-group clinical trials including 252 patients studied over periods of 3–8 weeks", with meta-analysis showing improvement in "59% of the subjects taking antipsychotics and 41% of those taking placebo"; studies used doses "ranging from 66 to 267 mg/day in chlorpromazine equivalents", adverse effects were "common", and "Dropout rates were also high". A more recent meta-analysis found clinically significant improvement in "64%… versus 38%… translating to an effect size of 26%", with "No differences in efficacy… among the different agents" and "Significant side effects… 25% more" with active treatment; another review reported "61% with antipsychotics and 35% with placebo, yielding a treatment effect of 26%". For second-generation antipsychotic risperidone, "Three placebo-controlled trials" are noted; in a fixed-dose study of "625 patients", response rates were "45% and 50% for 1 mg/day and 2 mg/day, respectively… than placebo (33%)… (the 0.5-mg/day dose was not more effective than placebo)", and "Parkinsonism was seen in 21% of patients who received 2 mg/day", concluding "the 1 mg/day represented the most effective dose".

### Safety and tolerability of IRL790 in Parkinson's disease with levodopa-induced dyskinesia-a phase 1b trial [^115QfLLw]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2018). Low credibility.

Results

Between November 2016 and March 2017, 18 patients were screened and 15 patients were randomized (Fig. 1). Demographics and baseline treatment of the intention-to-treat (ITT) population are shown in Table 1.

Fig. 1
Overview of trial profile

Table 1
Baseline demographics and treatment for the intention-to-treat (ITT) population

Following dose titration, the average dose titrated for placebo patients during the last 2 weeks of treatment was 42 mg (20–80 mg) daily. For IRL790-treated patients, the average dose was 18 mg (10–30 mg) daily. Three patients ended up taking 10 mg once daily. Since the protocol stated the lowest dose to 10 mg b.i.d. and the highest to 40 mg b.i.d. these doses were in violation with the protocol. However, it was agreed that these dose adjustments constituted minor protocol deviations and were thus allowed. Eight patients (72.8%) treated with IRL790 and one (25.0%) of the placebo patients had the dose reduced due to an adverse event (AE) at any time during the first 14 days of treatment. Listings of dose decisions and related AEs are summarized in Supplementary Table 1.

A total of 62 AEs was reported by 14 patients (93.3%). The total number of AEs was 41 when counting an event term only once per patient (i.e. patient unique AEs). Most AEs were reported during the titration phase (first 14 days of treatment), 48 AEs were reported between day 1 and 14 of treatment (titration phase), and 14 AEs between day 14 and follow-up. For system organ class (SOCs) belonging to nervous system disorders and psychiatric disorders, patients treated with IRL790 reported 33 AEs between day 1 and 14 of treatment and 8 AEs between day 14 and follow-up (Fig. 2).

### Treatment dilemma in comorbidity of schizophrenia and idiopathic Parkinson's disease [^1161QpjH]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

Extrapyramidal symptoms are frequently found in patients with schizophrenia. Most are attributed as drug-induced parkinsonism, but comorbidity of idiopathic Parkinson's disease is also possible. We report a 59-year-old male with a diagnosis of schizophrenia for 32 years. Progressive hand tremor was noted from age 53; and then masked face, bradykinesia, dysphagia, sialorrhea; and unsteady shuffling gait became markedly exacerbated, even after discontinuing all antipsychotics for 6 months. The diagnosis of idiopathic Parkinson's disease was confirmed by Tc99m TRODAT SPECT. The dilemma of psychopharmacological treatment to control both disorders was encountered. Based on the review of treatment for Parkinson's disease psychosis (PDP), the recommended treatments suggest the utilization of quetiapine, clozapine, or aripiprazole. However, monotherapy with each of the three atypical antipsychotics failed due to poor efficacy or worsening of parkinsonism symptoms. After a 2-month cautious titration, a combination of quetiapine 50 mg/day and clozapine 37.5 mg/day finally achieved satisfactory efficacy. This case report illustrates the dilemma of treating a patient with schizophrenia and comorbid idiopathic Parkinson's disease, which differed from PDP and required more clinical data for a proper treatment recommendation.

### Safety and tolerability of IRL790 in Parkinson's disease with levodopa-induced dyskinesia-a phase 1b trial [^113EUhFB]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2018). Low credibility.

IRL790 is a novel compound with psychomotor stabilizing properties primarily targeting the dopamine D3 receptor. IRL790 is developed as an experimental treatment for levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID), impulse control disorder, and psychosis in Parkinson's disease (PD). The primary objective was to investigate the safety and tolerability of IRL790 in PD patients with LID in a randomized controlled trial. PD patients with peak-dose dyskinesia were randomized to placebo or IRL790 treatment (1:3 ratio) for 4 weeks. Study drug was given as an adjunct treatment to the patients' regular stable antiparkinsonian medication. Dosing was individually titrated for 14 days, whereafter dosing was kept stable for an additional 14 days. Fifteen patients were randomized to treatment and 13 patients completed the 4-week treatment. Adverse events were mostly reported during the titration phase of the trial. They were mainly central nervous system related and could be mitigated by dose adjustments. There were no serious adverse events. There were no clinically significant changes in vital signs, electrocardiogram, and laboratory parameters due to the treatment. The average dose in the stable dose phase was 18mg daily, yielding a 2-h post-dose plasma concentration of average 229nM on day 28. Assessments for motor function showed a numeric reduction in dyskinesia. It is concluded that IRL790 can be safely administered to patients with advanced PD. The results will be of guidance for the design of phase 2 studies.
