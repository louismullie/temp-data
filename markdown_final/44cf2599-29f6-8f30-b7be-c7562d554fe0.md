## Question

What is the management of acute hydroneohrosis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the management of acute hydronephrosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate stabilization and whether this is an emergency. Then, I should verify the best initial imaging modality and what to do if ultrasound is nondiagnostic. Next, I will consider how to stratify severity and decide between conservative versus interventional management. After that, I need to check the indications and timing for urgent decompression, including stent versus nephrostomy. Finally, I will review special populations, follow-up imaging, and definitive management pathways, making sure I cite the highest-quality guidelines and studies throughout.

> Let me first confirm the initial priorities: airway, breathing, circulation, and rapid assessment for sepsis, acute kidney injury, and electrolyte disturbances, because acute hydronephrosis can be a urologic emergency when obstruction is complicated by infection or renal failure. I need to ensure I do not miss systemic inflammatory response or shock physiology that would mandate immediate decompression and critical care support [^a166eb11] [^5818cbeb].

> Next, I should review imaging strategy. Ultrasound of the kidneys and bladder with Doppler is the first-line test to confirm hydronephrosis and look for stones, tumors, or other causes, and it avoids radiation. If ultrasound is nondiagnostic and suspicion remains high, noncontrast CT is appropriate in nonpregnant adults, whereas MRI without gadolinium is preferred in pregnancy. I should double-check that I'm aligning with ACR Appropriateness Criteria for both obstructive uropathy and hydronephrosis of unknown cause, which endorse US first and escalate based on context and pregnancy status [^a166eb11] [^dcbae1ca] [^8b5c6286].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about etiology. I need to stratify severity and the likelihood of true obstruction using clinical and imaging features: degree of hydronephrosis, presence of hydroureter, stone size and location, signs of infection, renal function, and whether this is a solitary kidney or transplant. Larger stones, proximal location, fever, leukocytosis, and systemic inflammatory response increase the chance of needing intervention rather than conservative care, so I should document these carefully before deciding on management [^3f365a1e] [^f9ff7b83] [^5818cbeb].

> I will now examine conservative management, which is appropriate for stable patients without infection or significant renal impairment. Analgesia with NSAIDs and acetaminophen, antiemetics, hydration tailored to cardiopulmonary status, and alpha-blockers to facilitate stone passage are reasonable. I should confirm that patients can follow up reliably and provide straining instructions for stone retrieval, and I need to ensure I have a low threshold to pivot if pain becomes refractory or complications emerge [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify the indications for urgent decompression. Infected hydronephrosis, acute kidney injury in a solitary kidney or bilateral obstruction, refractory pain despite appropriate analgesia, and progressive renal dysfunction are clear triggers for emergent drainage. I should act quickly because delays worsen sepsis and renal outcomes, and I must involve urology early in these scenarios [^a166eb11] [^fd54e59a].

> For decompression, I should compare stent versus nephrostomy. Retrograde ureteral stenting is often first-line when feasible, but percutaneous nephrostomy is preferred for septic patients who are unstable, for extrinsic compression where stent passage is unlikely, or when retrograde access fails. I need to remember that randomized data show no clear superiority of one modality for decompression or sepsis resolution, so institutional expertise and patient factors should guide the choice, and I should counsel on stent symptoms versus nephrostomy care [^fd54e59a] [^86ed0616] [^04191350].

> Let me consider special populations carefully. In pregnancy, I should prioritize ultrasound and MRI without contrast, start with conservative measures, and reserve stent or nephrostomy for refractory symptoms or infection, recognizing that physiologic hydronephrosis is common and most cases resolve without intervention. In pediatrics, most antenatal hydronephrosis resolves spontaneously, so I should avoid over-imaging and over-treating, using serial ultrasounds and selective VCUG or diuretic renography only when indicated by severity or clinical course [^8b5c6286] [^27d928f6] [^e70e421a] [^2157e6cd].

> I should confirm follow-up imaging and labs. After initial stabilization, repeat ultrasound in 24 to 48 hours is prudent to ensure decompression and trajectory of renal pelvis dilation, and serial creatinine helps track renal recovery. If a stent or nephrostomy is placed, I need to plan for definitive stone or stricture management to avoid prolonged drainage and its complications [^notfound].

> Next, I should review definitive management once the patient is stabilized. Ureteroscopy with stone extraction or laser lithotripsy is appropriate for retained stones, ESWL can be considered for select stones and anatomy, and pyeloplasty is indicated for persistent UPJ obstruction with declining function or symptoms. I need to ensure shared decision-making about timing and approach, balancing stone burden, renal function, and patient preferences [^2200b7a1].

> But wait, what if ultrasound shows no hydronephrosis and I still suspect obstruction? Obstruction without hydronephrosis can occur in retroperitoneal fibrosis, malignancy, or dehydrated patients, so I should escalate to contrast-enhanced CT with delayed images or MR urography when safe, and maintain a high index of suspicion if clinical features are compelling, because missing an obstructive process can delay life-saving decompression [^5737ab87] [^dcbae1ca].

> Finally, I need to ensure documentation and communication are complete: record the etiology, severity grading, management rationale, and follow-up plan, and coordinate with urology, nephrology, obstetrics, or pediatrics as appropriate. I should double-check that my plan aligns with ACR Appropriateness Criteria and contemporary urology guidelines to minimize variability and optimize outcomes [^a166eb11] [^2157e6cd].

Acute hydronephrosis is managed by **immediate imaging** (ultrasound first-line) [^a166eb11] to confirm obstruction and guide therapy, followed by **urgent decompression** if there is infection, renal failure, or refractory pain [^fd54e59a]. Conservative care (analgesia, fluids, observation) is appropriate for stable patients without infection or significant renal impairment [^6a407358]. Definitive treatment targets the cause — stones, strictures, or extrinsic compression — using ureteroscopy, ESWL, or stenting/nephrostomy as indicated [^a166eb11]. Early intervention prevents irreversible renal damage and complications [^a166eb11].

---

## Initial evaluation and diagnosis

### Clinical assessment

Clinical assessment should evaluate for **flank pain, hematuria, oliguria/anuria, fever, and signs of sepsis** [^bec52484]. Risk factors include nephrolithiasis, malignancy, prior pelvic/retroperitoneal surgery, neurogenic bladder, and congenital anomalies [^bc8df2bc].

---

### Imaging studies

- **Ultrasound (US)**: First-line to confirm hydronephrosis, assess severity, and identify stones or masses [^a166eb11].
- **Non-contrast CT**: Gold standard for stone detection and localization when US is inconclusive or intervention is planned [^notfound].
- **MRI**: Alternative in pregnancy or contrast allergy; avoids radiation [^dcbae1ca].
- **Laboratory tests**: CBC, electrolytes, BUN/creatinine, urinalysis, and urine culture to assess renal function and infection [^notfound].

---

## Indications for urgent intervention

Urgent decompression is indicated for:

| **Indication** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|
| Infected hydronephrosis (pyonephrosis) | Risk of urosepsis and renal loss [^fd54e59a] |
| Acute kidney injury (AKI) or renal failure | Prevent irreversible renal damage [^a166eb11] |
| Refractory pain despite analgesia | Improve patient comfort and prevent complications [^6a407358] |
| Solitary kidney with obstruction | Preserve renal function [^notfound] |

---

## Conservative management

Conservative management is appropriate for stable patients without infection or significant renal impairment and includes:

- **Analgesia**: NSAIDs or acetaminophen; opioids if needed [^notfound].
- **Hydration**: IV fluids unless contraindicated.
- **Observation**: Serial imaging and labs to monitor for deterioration [^notfound].
- **Medical expulsive therapy**: Alpha-blockers (e.g. tamsulosin) for distal ureteral stones [^notfound].

---

## Interventional management

### Temporary drainage

Temporary drainage options include **ureteral stenting** (retrograde double-J stent) — first-line for most obstructions, with high success and low morbidity [^86ed0616] — and **percutaneous nephrostomy** (PCN), preferred for septic/unstable patients, extrinsic compression, or failed stenting [^86ed0616].

---

### Definitive treatment

Definitive treatment depends on the **cause**:

- **Ureteral stones**: Ureteroscopy with laser lithotripsy or ESWL [^notfound].
- **UPJ obstruction**: Pyeloplasty (open or robotic) [^2200b7a1].
- **Malignant obstruction**: Long-term stenting or PCN with oncologic therapy [^4cac16ea].
- **Strictures**: Balloon dilation or surgical repair [^notfound].

---

## Special considerations

### Pregnancy

In pregnancy, **physiologic hydronephrosis** is common; conservative management is first-line [^27d928f6]. If intervention is needed, stenting or nephrostomy are safe with ultrasound guidance [^8b5c6286].

---

### Pediatric patients

In pediatric patients, most cases resolve spontaneously; **conservative management** with serial ultrasound is standard [^f60977e9]. Surgery is reserved for persistent obstruction, declining function, or recurrent infections [^2200b7a1].

---

## Complications of untreated acute hydronephrosis

Untreated acute hydronephrosis can lead to **irreversible renal damage** from prolonged obstruction, as well as acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease [^a166eb11]. Patients are at risk of urosepsis, particularly with infected hydronephrosis [^fd54e59a], and may experience hypertension from renin-mediated mechanisms [^b63469db].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Follow-up should include **serial renal ultrasounds** to confirm resolution and renal recovery, as well as periodic assessment of renal function with electrolytes and creatinine. Management should address underlying causes to prevent recurrence.

---

Acute hydronephrosis requires **prompt imaging** and risk-stratified management: urgent decompression for infection, renal failure, or refractory pain; conservative care for stable patients; and definitive therapy tailored to the cause. Early, evidence-based care prevents renal loss and complications [^a166eb11].

The evaluation and management of fetuses/children with antenatal hydronephrosis (ANH) poses a significant dilemma for the practitioner. Which patients require evaluation, intervention or observation? Though the literature is quite extensive, it is plagued with bias and conflicting data, creating much confusion as to the optimal care of patients with ANH. In this article, we summarized the literature and proposed recommendations for the evaluation and management of ANH.

### Symptomatic hydronephrosis and ureteral calculi in pregnancy: a narrative review with a proposed management protocol [^8b5c6286]. Journal of Endourology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction: Approximately 3% of pregnancies are complicated by symptomatic hydronephrosis and up to 0.8% with urolithiasis. Pain, coupled with the possibility of superimposed infection, increases the risks of premature labor and delivery, fetal loss, and caesarian sections. Surgical intervention as well as standard ionizing radiation imaging modalities are typically avoided making this a difficult, high-risk patient cohort to manage. In this study we propose a standardized contemporaneous approach to investigations and management in the pregnant population with acute upper tract pathology analysis. Methods: A literature search of PubMed, Cochrane, and EMBASE databases was performed to identify original, peer-reviewed articles from 2010 onward on the management of ureteral calculi and symptomatic hydronephrosis occurring during pregnancy. Search yielded 5636 articles and after exclusions, 24 full-text articles met inclusion criteria for analysis. Evidence Synthesis: Ultrasound remains the cornerstone of initial investigation with MRI in reserve if the diagnosis remains uncertain. Low-dose CT imaging can be used in limited cases. Conservative approaches for symptomatic hydronephrosis as well ureteral calculi is the preferred initial management option in the well patient. If intervention is required, ureteral stent and nephrostomy can be used with informed consent on the risks and benefits of each. Primary ureteroscopy with definitive stone management in centers with the appropriate expertise can safely deliver excellent stone-free rates and symptomatic improvement. Conclusions: Individualized investigation and management plans following a structured approach in pregnant women with symptomatic hydronephrosis or calculi are discussed. At all stages, the patient, obstetrician, anesthetist, and surgeon should be involved in a shared decision-making approach.

### Mild to moderate postnatal hydronephrosis – grading systems and management [^c46080c5]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2013). Medium credibility.

No universal guidelines exist for the management of patients with mild to moderate antenatal hydronephrosis (ANH). Unsurprisingly, practice patterns vary considerably with respect to recommendations for postnatal evaluation and follow-up imaging schedule. Although some clinical tools are available to specifically grade ANH and postnatal hydronephrosis, these are commonly used interchangeably with varying degrees of success. A universal classification system and nomenclature are needed to best identify patients at risk of renal deterioration, UTI and need for surgical intervention. We present our own approach to postnatal risk stratification and management, including recommendations regarding serial ultrasonography schedule, prophylactic antibiotics, voiding cystourethrogram and renal scintigraphy.

### Evidence-based drainage of infected hydronephrosis secondary to ureteric calculi [^fd54e59a]. Journal of Endourology (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

The obstructed, infected kidney is a urological emergency. It has been accepted that the management of infected hydronephrosis secondary to ureteric stones is through prompt decompression of the collecting system. However, the optimal method of decompression has yet to be established.

Materials and Methods

A PubMed and Medline search was performed of all English-language articles from 1960 using key words "sepsis", "urosepsis", "obstruction", "obstructive pyelonephritis", "pyonephrosis", "infection and hydronephrosis" "decompression", "stent", "nephrostomy", and "management". The Cochrane database and National Institute for Clinical Effectiveness guidelines were searched using the terms "sepsis", "urosepsis", "stent", "nephrostomy", or "obstruction". Scottish intercollegiate guidelines were reviewed and no relevant guidance was identified.

Results

Two randomised trials have compared retrograde stent insertion with percutaneous nephrostomy with one trial reporting specifically on patients with acute sepsis and obstruction. Neither trial showed one superior modality of decompression in effecting decompression and resolution of sepsis. A further literature search regarding the complications of percutaneous nephrostomy and stent insertion was carried out. An overall major complication rate from percutaneous nephrostomy insertion was found to be 4%, although the complication rates from stent insertion are less consistently reported.

Discussion

There appears little evidence to suggest that retrograde stent insertion leads to increased bacteraemia or is significantly more hazardous in the setting of acute obstruction. Further region-wide discussion between urologists and interventional radiologists is required to establish management protocols for these acutely unwell patients.

### Neonatal and early infancy management of prenatally detected hydronephrosis [^64862a72]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2015). Low credibility.

Hydronephrosis discovered during prenatal ultrasound will often resolve spontaneously; however, it should be evaluated in the postnatal period in a manner commensurate with its risk of renal injury. Early intervention is appropriate in cases of bladder outlet obstruction or the severely obstructed solitary kidney. In most other cases, it is both safe and reasonable to allow the possibility of spontaneous improvement with the intensity of follow-up based on the severity of the hydronephrosis. Clinical decision making should be a shared process between families and caregivers.

### Ureteropelvic junction obstruction / hydronephrosis [^2200b7a1]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Congenital hydronephrosis can be classified and managed based on the Urinary Tract Dilation consensus scoring system. Ureteropelvic junction obstruction is one of the most common causes of hydronephrosis in the pediatric population. Although most cases can be managed conservatively with follow-up and serial imaging, some patients need surgical repair because of renal function deterioration, infections, or symptoms. Additional research to create predictive algorithms or develop noninvasive biomarkers for renal deterioration is necessary to better identify surgical candidates. The robotic-assisted approach for pyeloplasty is becoming increasingly widespread and associated with shorter hospital stay, high success rates, and low complication rates.

### Symptomatic physiologic hydronephrosis in pregnancy: incidence, complications and treatment [^27d928f6]. European Urology (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

We present the incidence and results of treatment of symptomatic physiologic hydronephrosis in 3,400 pregnant women.

Methods

We analyzed 103 consecutive women who presented with clinical signs and symptoms related to the upper urinary system. Renal sonography, urinalysis, serum creatinine levels, white blood cell (WBC) count, and urine culture were done in all patients at first visit and repeated at least once a month until 1 month after delivery. In patients who manifested acute pyelonephritis, urinalysis, WBC count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein levels were repeated every 3 days until normalization, and urine culture as well as renal sonography were performed once a week until 1 month after delivery. Conservative measures (positioning, analgesia, antibiotics) were performed in all patients with symptomatic physiologic hydronephrosis. If the patient's condition was refractory to medical management, drainage of the ureter with a double pigtail stent was performed.

Results

Conservative measures were successful in 97 (94%) of 103 patients but 6 (6%) patients had ongoing signs and symptoms of acute pyelonephritis progressing to urosepsis. In all of them, antibiotics were continued and a double pigtail stent was placed resulting in fast regression of symptoms, curing of renal infection and progress of the pregnancies to the term with vaginal delivery.

Conclusions

Symptomatic hydronephrosis in pregnancy can be treated conservatively. If the patient's condition is refractory to medical management, an internal drainage with double pigtail stent may be necessary.

### Hydronephrosis: a view from the inside [^a199d563]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Unilateral ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO) is the most common prenatally detected disease leading to hydronephrosis. The obstructive anatomic lesion leads to varying degrees of hydronephrosis, ranging from no apparent effect on renal function to atrophy. Furthermore, the natural course of hydronephrosis varies from spontaneous resolution to progressive deterioration and may take upwards of 3 years for a kidney to declare itself. The objectives of this article are to update our knowledge regarding the evaluation and management of UPJO in depth and to discuss the emerging value of urinary proteome analysis to the clinical arena.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of chronic kidney disease [^bec52484]. DoD/VA (2025). High credibility.

Assessment for acute kidney disorder (AKD) includes evaluation for volume depletion (e.g., lightheadedness or dizziness, hypotension, orthostasis); for urinary obstruction with symptoms of voiding dysfunction, flank pain, or hematuria, elevated post-void bladder volume, or evidence of obstruction on kidney imaging (e.g., hydronephrosis); and for suspicion of acute glomerular or interstitial disease (e.g., hematuria, dysmorphic RBCs or RBC casts, new onset or acute increase in albuminuria) with recent illness (e.g., infection), constitutional or rheumatologic symptoms, rash, edema, and hemoptysis.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for congenital hydronephrosis, more specifically with respect to renal and bladder ultrasound, ACR 2024 guidelines recommend to obtain renal and bladder ultrasound to evaluate for renal anomalies and hydronephrosis in patients aged < 2 months presenting with a first episode of febrile UTI with an appropriate response to medical management.

### Requirements for accurately diagnosing chronic partial upper urinary tract obstruction in children with hydronephrosis [^e836337e]. Pediatric Radiology (2008). Low credibility.

Successful management of hydronephrosis in the newborn requires early accurate diagnosis to identify or exclude ureteropelvic junction obstruction. However, the presence of hydronephrosis does not define obstruction and displays unique behavior in the newborn. The hydronephrotic kidney usually has nearly normal differential renal function at birth, has not been subjected to progressive dilation and except for pelvocaliectasis does not often show signs of high-grade obstruction. Furthermore, severe hydronephrosis resolves spontaneously in more than 65% of newborns with differential renal function stable or improving. The diagnosis of obstruction in newborn hydronephrosis is challenging because the currently available diagnostic tests, ultrasonography and diuretic renography have demonstrated inaccuracy in diagnosing obstruction and predicting which hydronephrotic kidney will undergo deterioration if untreated. Accurate diagnosis of obstruction is possible but it requires an understanding of the uniqueness of both the pathophysiology of obstruction and the biology of the kidney and renal collecting system in this age group. We examine here the requirements for making an accurate diagnosis of obstruction in the young child with hydronephrosis.

### Analgesic refractory colic pain: is prolonged conservative management appropriate? [^6a407358]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To propose a clear definition and management pathway of patients with analgesic refractory colic pain (ARCP).

Patients and Methods

Prospective cohort study from February 2018 to February 2019 including patients with ARCP defined as ongoing renal colic pain after one dose of IV NSAID, IV paracetamol, and a parenteral opioid, given sequentially in that order. Patients were observed in-hospital under full parenteral analgesic management for 8–12 h, whenever patients had minimal or absent pain after conservative management (CM) they were discharged, and followed-up with new imaging within four weeks. If the pain was not controlled after CM, surgical management (double-J stent or ureteroscopy) was performed. We excluded patients with any other indication for urgent intervention or in cases where CM was deemed inappropriate (sepsis, acute renal failure, stones > 10 mm in size, suspected concomitant urinary tract infection, bilateral ureteral stones, pregnancy, patients with a single kidney, kidney transplant recipients, difficult access to medical care or refusal to undergo CM).

Results

Data from 60 patients was collected. The only variable associated with an increased risk of failed CM was a history of previous renal colic (OR 3.98 [95% CI 1.14–13.84], p = 0.02). Neither gender, age, stone size, location, or hydronephrosis grade were able to predict CM failure. 41.6% of patients were successfully managed conservatively and only 8% of them required scheduled surgical management at follow-up.

Conclusion

Our results show that a high proportion of patients with ARCP may be successfully managed conservatively with an extended observation period without complications at follow-up. These results should be replicated in a randomized controlled trial to confirm them.

Epidemiology and prior management approaches — Antenatal detection identified hydronephrosis in 1% to 3% of pregnancies, and early discovery of UTD prompted indiscriminate recommendations for prophylactic antibiotics, lower urinary tract imaging, and early surgical intervention; these recommendations were made with good intentions but were not evidence based.

### Guidelines for complicated urinary tract infections in children: a review by the European society for pediatric infectious diseases [^e1335d40]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Children with severe clinical presentation need further investigation regarding urological pathology and VUR. In the absence of these, there is no evidence of benefit for CAP in children after severe presentation.

The most relevant non-urologic underlying condition is renal transplant. Although acute UTI negatively impacts graft function, it remains unclear whether CAP can prevent posttransplant UTI. Children with other conditions may receive antibiotic prophylaxis (eg, immunocompromised), but there is no data supporting the benefit specifically to prevent UTI.

Although there are no RCTs in neonates and infants < 2 m, systematic reviews suggest CAP may be useful in high-grade antenatal hydronephrosis, hydronephrosis with ureteral dilatation or hydronephrosis in uncircumcised infants.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® radiologic management of urinary tract obstruction [^a166eb11]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Acute obstructive uropathy is a medical emergency, which often is accompanied by acute renal failure or sepsis. Treatment options to resolve the acute obstructive process include conservative medical management, retrograde ureteral stenting, or placement of percutaneous nephrostomy or nephroureteral catheters. It is important to understand the various treatment options in differing clinical scenarios in order to guide appropriate consultation. Prompt attention to the underlying obstructive process is often imperative to avoid further deterioration of the patient's clinical status. A summary of the data and most up-to-date clinical trials regarding treatment options for urinary tract obstruction is outlined in this publication. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

Imaging

Historically, guidelines recommended aggressive imaging follow-up to identify renal scarring and complications from UTI. It is now known that the most children at risk of complications have structural abnormalities identifiable on ultrasound or recurrent UTI. Therefore, many recent guidelines suggest less or no imaging after first uncomplicated UTI for older children and less aggressive imaging after recurrent UTI (table 3).

Table 3
Summary of imaging recommendations from selected international guidelines for young children with UTI

Ultrasound

Ultrasound is non-invasive, relatively inexpensive and an appropriate first-line investigation when imaging is indicated. Ultrasound can detect anatomical abnormalities and hydronephrosis or hydroureter suggesting obstruction or VUR. American and Canadian guidelines recommend ultrasound for all children aged < 2 years with first UTI, European Association of Urology guidelines recommend ultrasound for all children with first febrile UTI, while NICE recommends ultrasound only for infants < 6 months with first UTI unless infection is atypical or not responding to treatment. The NICE approach reflects the view that routine imaging after all first UTI is not cost-effective; however, imaging in younger children and other selected cases is more likely to detect findings of clinical significance. Ultrasound cannot exclude all cases of VUR but should detect most higher grade and clinically significant cases.

Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan

DMSA scan is a nuclear isotope uptake scan. Reduced uptake in the kidney can reflect either acute dysfunction (pyelonephritis) or long term damage (scarring), depending on the timing of the test. It is rarely required acutely but may help guide long-term management. DMSA may be indicated if UTI is atypical, recurrent or if initial ultrasound is significantly abnormal.

Voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG)

VCUG uses fluoroscopy (real-time X-ray) to identify the course of contrast inserted by bladder catheterisation. Bladder filling, emptying and ureteric reflux can be identified. While VCUG is the gold standard for identifying and quantifying VUR, the procedure has a radiation burden and is invasive.

Consensus for exactly who and how to image is lacking. Cost, invasiveness and radiation burden must be balanced against the likelihood of identifying an abnormality which may change management for the child. While most children with uncomplicated UTI outside infancy do not require any imaging, some children are at risk of long-term morbidity after UTI. Therefore, targeted imaging and surveillance strategies for children with selected indications remains appropriate.

### Fetal hydronephrosis: is there hope for consensus? [^6bd29ae6]. Pediatric Radiology (2004). Low credibility.

This review article aims at summarizing the data regarding fetal and neonatal hydronephrosis, at correlating controversial data with the differences in the practice of obstetrical sonography from one country to another, and finally, at presenting our own criteria for fetal renal collecting system dilatation along with our own guidelines of postnatal investigation.

### Prenatal hydronephrosis: bridging pre-and postnatal management [^f60977c9]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2022). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract dilation (UTD), including hydronephrosis (HN) is the most common prenatally detected anomaly and affects up to 1%-2% of pregnancies. Postnatally, it resolves without surgical intervention in approximately 75%-80% of children, however this may take several years to occur, necessitating repeated clinic visits and additional invasive testing for many. For the remainder, a surgical intervention will be offered to relieve obstruction or to correct vesicoureteral reflux. During the monitoring period, many of these infants will be offered continuous antibiotic prophylaxis for the prevention of urinary tract infections, however this remains a controversial topic among pediatric urologists and nephrologists. Herein, we present an up-to-date review of the early management of prenatally detected UTD including timing of postnatal imaging, the use of antibiotics, when circumcision may be beneficial and long term outcomes of the most common HN etiologies. We also propose a decision making tool to help guide the care of infants with UTD.

### What is the appropriate use of renal sonography in an inner-city population with new-onset acute kidney injury? [^314118ac]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

We aimed to determine the prevalence of hydronephrosis in patients who underwent renal sonography for new-onset acute kidney injury (AKI) and to identify clinical factors predictive of hydronephrosis. In patients with hydronephrosis, we sought to investigate how routine renal sonography affects patient treatment, including performance of interventional procedures.

Methods

A retrospective chart review identified 274 adults with AKI who underwent renal sonography at an urban teaching hospital from January through July 2011. The prevalence of hydronephrosis was determined. Electronic medical records were reviewed for comorbidities, including risk factors for hydronephrosis such as a pelvic mass, prior renal or pelvic surgery, and neurogenic bladder, and for subsequent interventions and outcomes.

Results

Sonography showed hydronephrosis in 28 patients (10%); 5 (18%) had subsequent interventions. In a multivariable logistic regression model with the outcome being hydronephrosis, all considered risk factors (pelvic mass, prior renal or pelvic surgery, and neurogenic bladder) were significantly associated with hydronephrosis (odds ratio, 6.4; 95% confidence interval, 2.7–15.4; P < .001) when adjusting for age and diabetes mellitus. Diabetes had a negative predictive value for hydronephrosis. No diabetic patients younger than 85 years and without clinical risk factors had hydronephrosis.

Conclusions

Hydronephrosis is infrequently seen on sonograms in hospitalized patients with AKI who lack risk factors for urinary tract obstruction. Deferral of sonography pending a trial of medical treatment is safe and will reduce medical costs. Adoption of clinical guidelines to assess patients' risk levels for hydronephrosis is critical to avoid unnecessary imaging.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® hydronephrosis on prior imaging-unknown cause [^dcbae1ca]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Initial imaging evaluation of hydronephrosis of unknown etiology is a complex subject and is dependent on clinical context. In asymptomatic patients, it is often best conducted via CT urography (CTU) without and with contrast, MR urography (MRU) without and with contrast, or scintigraphic evaluation with mercaptoacetyltriglycine (MAG3) imaging. For symptomatic patients, CTU without and with contrast, MRU without and with contrast, MAG3 scintigraphy, or ultrasound of the kidneys and bladder with Doppler imaging are all viable initial imaging studies. In asymptomatic pregnant patients, nonionizing imaging with US of the kidneys and bladder with Doppler imaging is preferred. Similarly, in symptomatic pregnant patients, US of the kidneys and bladder with Doppler imaging or MRU without contrast is the imaging study of choice, as both ionizing radiation and gadolinium contrast are avoided in pregnancy. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® antenatal hydronephrosis-infant [^d81869de]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2020). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for congenital hydronephrosis, more specifically with respect to imaging follow-up, ACR 2020 guidelines recommend to obtain a follow-up renal and bladder ultrasound in 1–6 months in infants with a normal postnatal ultrasound and an antenatal diagnosis of hydronephrosis.

### Giant hydronephrosis presenting as an acute abdomen [^9fed3a8d]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Giant hydronephrosis is a relatively rare condition caused by obstruction of the renal collecting system that can present with a great number of different types of abdominal signs and symptoms.

Case Report

A 40-year-old man without past medical history presented to the Emergency Department with diffuse abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. On examination, he was found to have an acute abdomen. Computed tomography scan revealed left giant hydronephrosis secondary to an obstructing renal calculus. The patient had a left percutaneous nephrostomy tube placed, which drained over 7 L of fluid from the dilatated collecting system.

Conclusion

Giant hydronephrosis is a rare potential cause of abdominal pain, particularly in the context of a patient with known nephrolithiasis, structural urologic abnormalities, or malignancy.

### Prenatal hydronephrosis: early evaluation [^4b333436]. Current Opinion in Urology (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Fetal hydronephrosis is the most common anomaly detected on antenatal ultrasound examination, and its significance and management remain controversial. This review aims to address the early postnatal evaluation of the child with prenatally diagnosed hydronephrosis.

Recent Findings

The risk of significant urological pathology increases with the severity of prenatal hydronephrosis. The most common underlying conditions are ureteropelvic junction obstruction and vesicoureteral reflux. The use of postnatal ultrasonograpy in all patients with a history of any degree of prenatal hydronephrosis is routine, but ascertaining which patients require postnatal evaluation with a voiding cystourethrogram to investigate for vesicoureteral reflux remains controversial. Mild cases are the most controversial as the risk of pathology is lessened, however the risk of vesicoureteral reflux and consequent febrile urinary tract infection may be significant. Early postnatal evaluation of all children with a history of prenatal hydronephrosis with a voiding cystourethrogram may reduce this risk. No prospective randomized clinical trials are available, however, to adequately address the question of which patients require postnatal evaluation.

Summary

The postnatal management of prenatal hydronephrosis remains controversial. Sufficient data are lacking to inform patient risk stratification. Therefore, early postnatal evaluation of children with a history of any degree of prenatal hydronephrosis with an ultrasound and voiding cystourethrogram is reasonable and may reduce the risk of febrile urinary tract infection.

### Antenatal hydronephrosis as a predictor of postnatal outcome: a meta-analysis [^7cca9c18]. Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

Antenatal hydronephrosis is diagnosed in 1% to 5% of all pregnancies; however, the antenatal and postnatal management of hydronephrosis varies widely. No previous studies define the risk of postnatal pathology in infants with antenatal hydronephrosis. Our objective was to review the current literature to determine whether the degree of antenatal hydronephrosis and related antenatal ultrasound findings are associated with postnatal outcome.

Methods

We searched Medline (1966–2005), Embase (1991–2004), and the Cochrane Library databases for articles on antenatal hydronephrosis. We required studies to have subjects selected on the basis of documented measurements of antenatal hydronephrosis and followed to a postnatal diagnosis. We excluded case reports, review articles, and editorials. Two independent investigators extracted data.

Results

We screened 1645 citations, of which 17 studies met inclusion criteria. We created a data set of 1308 subjects. The risk of any postnatal pathology per degree of antenatal hydronephrosis was 11.9% for mild, 45.1% for moderate, and 88.3% for severe. There was a significant increase in risk per increasing degree of hydronephrosis. The risk of vesicoureteral reflux was similar for all degrees of antenatal hydronephrosis.

Conclusions

The findings of this meta-analysis can potentially be used for prenatal counseling and may alter current postnatal management of children with antenatal hydronephrosis. Overall, children with any degree of antenatal hydronephrosis are at greater risk of postnatal pathology as compared with the normal population. Moderate and severe antenatal hydronephrosis have a significant risk of postnatal pathology, indicating that comprehensive postnatal diagnostic management should be performed. Mild antenatal hydronephrosis may carry a risk for postnatal pathology, but additional prospective studies are needed to determine the optimal management of these children. A well-defined prospective analysis is needed to further define the risk of pathology and the appropriate management protocols.

### Antenatally detected hydronephrosis [^ae88ba93]. Seminars in Nuclear Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

The strategy of management of children with hydronephrosis has considerably changed as a result of the development of ultrasound techniques, allowing a prenatal detection. Hydronephrosis is defined as a dilation of the renal collecting system, and several entirely different clinical entities can be considered this general heading, whereas early detection may have a different impact depending on the entity considered. The present work aims to describe a certain number of these clinical entities, to discuss the strategic options of management that are proposed, and to evaluate the role of medical imaging, in particular the radionuclide approach. Congenital ureteropelvic junction anomaly, vesicoureteral reflux, posterior urethral valves, and duplex kidney will be successively considered. Multicystic dysplastic kidney disease, although not classified as hydronephrosis, will be mentioned because it may be mistaken for hydronephrosis.

### Can unenhanced CT findings predict interventional versus conservative treatment in acute renal colic? [^3f365a1e]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to determine the value of clinical parameters and radiologic findings on unenhanced CT to the choice between interventional and conservative management for patients with acute renal colic.

Materials and Methods

Unenhanced CT records of 183 consecutive patients with acute renal colic were retrospectively reviewed. Urolithiasis was confirmed at both unenhanced CT and clinical follow-up findings of 80 patients (study group). Clinical parameters (signs of infection and renal indexes) and unenhanced CT findings (tissue rim sign, hydronephrosis, perinephric and periureteral edema, ureteral dilatation, renal attenuation, and stone characteristics) were graded and correlated with the choice of clinical management. ROC analysis was constructed for the most statistically significant parameters.

Results

Forty-two patients (52%) were treated conservatively and 38 (48%) underwent interventional treatments. The relationship between shivering, fever, and leukocytosis and interventional treatment had low sensitivity (29%, 26%, and 16%, respectively) but very high specificity (98%, 95%, and 98%, respectively) (p < 0.05). Stone size and density were statistically significantly different between patients treated conservatively and those treated interventionally (size, 4.6 vs 6.7 mm; density, 730 vs 910 HU; p < 0.01). Stones larger than 6.5 mm with an attenuation value greater than 1100 HU and that were proximally located were more likely to be treated interventionally.

Conclusion

Larger stone size, higher density, proximal location, and complaints of shivering, fever, and leukocytosis are the most important parameters for predicting invasive management of acute renal colic. Other clinical and radiologic information may be useful as supportive findings but do not predict the choice of patient management.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® antenatal hydronephrosis-infant [^92022ad1]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Antenatal hydronephrosis is the most frequent urinary tract anomaly detected on prenatal ultrasonography. It occurs approximately twice as often in males as in females. Most antenatal hydronephrosis is transient with little long-term significance, and few children with antenatal hydronephrosis will have significant obstruction, develop symptoms or complications, and require surgery. Some children will be diagnosed with more serious conditions, such as posterior urethral valves. Early detection of obstructive uropathy is necessary to mitigate the potential morbidity from loss of renal function. Imaging is an integral part of screening, diagnosis, and monitoring of children with antenatal hydronephrosis. Optimal timing and appropriate use of imaging can reduce the incidence of late diagnoses and prevent renal scarring and other complications. In general, follow-up neonatal ultrasound is recommended for all cases of antenatal hydronephrosis, while further imaging, including voiding cystourethrography and nuclear scintigraphy, is recommended for moderate or severe cases, or when renal parenchymal or bladder wall abnormalities are suspected. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Role of antibiotic prophylaxis in antenatal hydronephrosis: a systematic review from the European Association of Urology / European Society for Paediatric Urology guidelines panel [^96c75fc4]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The benefits and harms of continuous antibiotic prophylaxis (CAP) versus observation in patients with antenatal hydronephrosis (ANH) are controversial.

Objective

The aim was to determine the effectiveness of CAP for ANH, and if beneficial to determine the best type and regimen of antibiotic and the most harmful to provide guidance for clinical practice.

Methods

A systematic literature search was performed in databases including Medline, Embase, and Cochrane in June 2015. The protocol was prospectively registered to PROSPERO (CRD42015024775). The search started from 1980, when maternal ultrasound was first introduced into clinical practice. Eligible studies were critically evaluated for risk of bias using Revman software. The outcomes included reduction in urinary tract infections (UTI), drug-related adverse events and kidney functions.

Results

Of 797 articles identified, 57 full text articles and six abstracts were eligible for inclusion (2 randomized controlled trials, 11 non-randomized comparative studies, and 50 case series). It remains unclear whether CAP is superior to observation in decreasing UTIs. No conclusion could be drawn for drug-related adverse events and kidney function because of lack of data. Children who were not circumcised, with ureteral dilatation, and high-grade hydronephrosis may be more likely to develop UTI, and CAP may be warranted for these subgroups of patients. A majority of the studies had low-to-moderate quality of evidence and with high risk of bias.

Conclusions

The benefits of CAP in a heterogeneous group of children with ANH involving different etiologies remains unproven. However, the evidence in the form of prospective and retrospective observational studies has shown that it reduces febrile UTI in particular subgroups.

### Acute mechanical duodenal obstruction due to giant hydronephrosis: an unusual cause of acute abdomen [^a32496ca]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Giant hydronephrosis (GH) is a rare clinical entity with about 600 cases and defined as the adult renal pelvis containing greater than 1 L of fluid, or at least 1.6% of the body weight or kidney occupying the hemiabdomen. The pelvic-ureteric junction (PUJ) obstruction is the most frequent cause of GH. We thus report a case of massive abdominal distension due to GH secondary to PUJ obstruction who presented with acute duodenal obstruction due to extrinsic compression and was managed with percutaneous nephrostomy followed by open nephrectomy.

### Obstructive nephropathy without hydronephrosis: suspicion is the key [^5737ab87]. Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Urinary tract obstruction leading to acute kidney injury is usually associated with bilateral hydroureters and hydronephrosis, often accompanied by oliguria. We present an atypical case of obstructive uropathy without these features that presented with severe acute kidney injury. A 64-year-old male with no known medical history has presented with a 2-week history of nausea, decreased appetite, flank pain, and lower extremity edema, and was found to have an elevated creatinine of 10.5mg/dL. Renal ultrasound showed mild prominence of the bilateral renal collecting systems with no evidence of hydronephrosis. Computed tomography scan showed findings suggestive of retroperitoneal fibrosis involving ureteral region and bilateral ureteral stent placement has led to dramatic improvement of creatinine to 1.3mg/dL over the next 4 days.

### Noninvasive management of obstructing ureteral stones using electromagnetic extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy [^651484ac]. Surgical Endoscopy (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) represents noninvasive management of urolithiasis. Since the first HM3 model, technological progress has improved the efficacy and safety of this treatment. The current study aimed to evaluate the role of ESWL as a first-line emergency therapy of renal colic due to ureteral stone with impaired renal function.

Methods

This prospective study enrolled all the patients admitted from the emergency room with acute renal colic meeting the following criteria: serum creatinine level ranging from 1.5 to 2.5 mg/dl, hydronephrosis, ureteral stones 6 to 15 mm in size, body mass index less than 30, normal renal function at baseline, and no evidence of urinary tract infection. The patients were submitted to a single-session emergency treatment using Dornier Litothripter S. Follow-up assessment, performed at 24 and 72 h, included radiologic and ultrasound examinations with renal function serum assessment. The end points were a decrease in creatinine level and a stone-free condition.

Results

A total of 40 patients were eligible for the study. The mean creatinine level at admission was 1.93 ± 0.26 mg/dl. After the treatment, renal function recovery occurred for 34 subjects (85%), with a significant global decrease in creatinine levels (p = 0.00). The global stone-free rate 72 h after SWL was 67.5% (27/40). The patients with residual fragments were managed using re-SWL (n = 7) and endoscopic technique (n = 6).

Conclusions

Emergency SWL represents an effective tool in the treatment of ureteral stones with hydronephrosis and slight renal impairment. Although complete stone clearance after one treatment still remains a difficult target, the actual role of SWL in the management of acute obstruction is to obtain ureteral canalization and renal function recovery.

### Point-of-care ultrasound identifies urinoma complicating simple renal colic: a case series and literature review [^97e484b2]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Renal colic is a frequently encountered diagnosis among emergency department patients. Point-of-care (POC) ultrasound has taken on an increasingly important role in the diagnostic strategy of this disease, as it has been shown to be an effective modality for diagnosis and for guiding management. The primary pathology that the emergency physician will evaluate for in cases of suspected renal colic is hydronephrosis, which is a dilatation of the renal pelvis and calyces resulting from a distal obstruction such as a ureteral stone. However, other significant findings can be seen, one of which is the extravasation of urine around the kidney secondary to a forniceal, or calyceal, rupture.

Case Series

We present three cases of unanticipated perinephric fluid collections identified initially on POC ultrasound in cases of suspected simple renal colic. Concomitant hydronephrosis was also seen in each of these cases. Why Should an Emergency Physician Be Aware of This? While the utilization of POC ultrasound in cases of suspected renal colic increases, we should be prepared to encounter and identify perinephric fluid collections in our evaluations. Although the ideal management of these cases is not completely defined from the current literature, we benefit from knowing how to identify these on POC ultrasound, understanding the underlying pathophysiology, and appreciating the possibility of complications that may arise.

### Renal ultrasound provides low utility in evaluating cardiac surgery associated acute kidney injury [^1143b91e]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

Although acute kidney injury is very common in severely ill hospitalized patients and renal ultrasound is effective in ruling out hydronephrosis, urinary tract obstruction, and poor perfusion, their universal use in all patients may cause unnecessary financial costs and subject patients to unneeded examinations.

Our institution's data clearly demonstrates a low incidence of obstructive or stenotic renal injury and that obtaining universal renal sonography for all postoperative cardiac patients in the setting of AKI did not significantly alter clinical decision-making. However, for those patients who did have altered clinical management, there is a preponderance of patients with chronic kidney disease suggesting that renal sonography can beneficial for those with pre-existing kidney disease.

In a similar study done by Keyserling et al. 105 ICU patients with acute kidney injury (demonstrated by serum creatinine level of 1.5 mg/dL or greater or elevation of serum creatinine level to 20% of baseline or higher) were reviewed. Of the 105 renal sonograms, only 1 showed evidence of mild hydronephrosis, which was not explored further. Their findings were consistent with our data, which showed majority (32/104; 30.5%) having medical renal disease and the remaining showing benign, incidental findings that did not modify clinical management.

In another study by Brivet et al. only 4% (16/360) of patients in an intensive care unit with acute renal failure had a post-renal or obstructive cause, with most cases (282/360; 79%) being secondary to intrinsic renal causes.

Finally, Podoll et al. studied 800 patients over a 3-year period for AKI and hydronephrosis was detected in slightly more than 5% with only 2.3% due to urinary tract obstruction. Moreover, the majority of hydronephrosis cases were mild and considered incidental. However, their study did show that severe characteristics such as age greater than 65, prior abdominal malignancy, prior pelvic or renal surgery, PID, abdominal trauma were all statistically significant in increased hydronephrosis, which is consistent with previous reports from Licurese et al. stating that abdominal abnormality and neoplasm confer a higher risk of detecting hydronephrosis on ultrasound.

### Evaluating practice patterns in postnatal management of antenatal hydronephrosis: a national survey of Canadian pediatric urologists and nephrologists [^f9cef1b3]. Urology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To ascertain practice patterns of prescribing continuous antibiotic prophylaxis (CAP) and obtaining a voiding cystourethrogram for infants with antenatal hydronephrosis (AHN) by pediatric nephrologists and urologists across Canada.

Methods

A previously piloted online survey was distributed to members of the Canadian pediatric nephrology and urology associations. Summarized confidential responses were stratified by specialty, AHN grade, and laterality.

Results

A total of 88 of 139 responses were received (response rate, 63.3%; 95% confidence interval, 55.0%-71.0%): 46 nephrologists, 39 urologists, and 3 undisclosed. Only 17 of 88 (19.32%; 95% confidence interval, 12.4%-28.8%) reported following standardized AHN protocols. Concern surrounding the development of urinary tract infections was the main deciding factor for prescribing CAP (nephrology, 65.4%; urology, 71.4%). Almost a third of nephrologists (29.6%) recommend CAP for bilateral low-grade AHN compared with 11.4% of urologists (P = 0.02); in contrast, 73% of nephrologists and 38.2% of urologists (P = 0.02) offer CAP in the presence of isolated high-grade AHN. In regards to indications for voiding cystourethrogram, 31% of pediatric nephrologists would recommend this test for patients with unilateral low-grade AHN compared with 7.7% of urologists (P < .01), although almost all nephrologists (96.6%) and 69.2% of urologists (P = 0.02) would obtain this test for patients with unilateral high-grade isolated AHN.

Conclusion

Our results show important practice variability between pediatric nephrologists and urologists in the management of children with AHN, which are partially explained by laterality and degree of dilation. This survey reflects the lack of treatment guidelines and supports efforts to obtain high-level evidence to develop management protocols for this common condition.

### Guidelines for complicated urinary tract infections in children: a review by the European society for pediatric infectious diseases [^dc2d834b]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Supportive Management

Additional management depends on the cUTI subgroup and complicating features. This may involve antiemetics, fluid resuscitation and management and occasionally intensive care support. There is no clear role for steroids currently (GRADE D).
Surgically, temporary diversion may be needed for urinary obstruction, and percutaneous drainage is considered for renal abscesses (GRADE D).

Modes of supportive care for cUTI are dependent on subgroup and presenting features. Severely ill patients may need fluid resuscitation and intensive care support. Patients with vomiting should have antiemetics, as this may avoid use of IV antibiotics. With obstructive uropathy, temporary urinary diversion may be needed if antibiotics alone fails. For renal abscesses > 3 cm, percutaneous drainage should be considered. A recent meta-analysis concluded that steroids reduced renal scarring associate with UTI. However, the included studies either did not show this at all, or did not reach statistical significance. Given the variations between included studies in inclusion criteria, intervention and timing and the uncertain clinical impact of scar reduction, there is no clear role for steroids in UTI currently. No other medications have been identified as beneficial.

How Should We Follow Up Children With cUTI?

Follow-up of children with cUTI involves consideration of antimicrobial prophylaxis, imaging and referral to nephrology/urology.

Antimicrobial prophylaxis

The benefit of continuous antibiotic prophylaxis is controversial and reserved for particular cUTI subgroups: (1) in neonates and infants < 2 m, this includes those with high-grade VUR (3–4), antenatal hydronephrosis (HN), ureteral dilatation and HN in uncircumcised infants; and (2) in older children, this includes those with multiple recurrent UTI, high-grade VUR (3–4), spina bifida accompanied with high-grade VUR and/or intermittent catheterization, bladder/bowel dysfunction and severe obstructive uropathy until surgical correction (GRADES B–D).
In neonates, amoxicillin is the drug of choice, while older children are recommended to use trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or nitrofurantoin (GRADES C and D).
Consider use of cranberry products in older children to alleviate antibiotic pressure (GRADE B).
Duration of CAP should not exceed 3–6 months followed by critical reevaluation (GRADE D).

### Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis: a complicated febrile urinary tract infection detected by point-of-care ultrasound in the emergency department [^9347322a]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Febrile urinary tract infections (UTIs) include a spectrum of pathologies from uncomplicated pyelonephritis to urosepsis, including xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis (XGP). Most febrile UTIs are treated with antibiotics alone, but studies indicate nearly 12% of cases of presumed simple pyelonephritis require emergent urologic intervention. How to identify these individuals, while limiting unnecessary advanced imaging and delays in diagnosis, challenges all emergency providers. We review the diagnosis and management of XGP, as well as the evidence regarding the role of renal ultrasound in the identification of complicated presentations of febrile UTIs.

Case Report

We present a case of XGP, a complicated febrile UTI requiring immediate urologic intervention, diagnosed by point-of-care ultrasound. A 40-year-old female presented in severe sepsis and complaining of flank pain. Prompt bedside ultrasound demonstrated hydronephrosis, expediting definitive urologic treatment via percutaneous nephrostomy tube placement. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? With a mortality rate exceeding 40%, obstructed pyonephrosis requires prompt decompression. Given its exceptional sensitivity for identifying hydronephrosis and ability to detect abscesses and emphysematous changes, we advocate a point-of-care ultrasound-first approach to screen for cases of complicated febrile UTIs in order to expedite treatment and limit radiation in uncomplicated presentations.

### Acute ureterolithiasis: incidence of secondary signs on unenhanced helical CT and influence on patient management [^f9ff7b83]. Clinical Radiology (2003). Low credibility.

Aim

The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence of secondary signs associated with ureteral stones on unenhanced helical computed tomography (CT) of patients with acute renal colic, and to correlate these with patient management and outcome.

Materials and Methods

One hundred and ten patients with ureterolithiasis were evaluated prospectively for the secondary signs of obstruction on unenhanced helical CT. Our attention was focused primarily on the presence or absence of seven secondary signs on unenhanced helical CT, including hydronephrosis, unilateral renal enlargement, perinephric oedema, unilateral absence of the white pyramid, hydroureter, periureteral oedema and lateroconal fascial thickening.

Results

Of the 110 patients, 91 (82.7%) had hydroureter, 88 (80%) had hydronephrosis, 65 (59%) had periureteric oedema and 63 (57.2%) had unilateral renal enlargement. Ninety stones passed spontaneously and 21 required intervention.

Conclusion

Secondary signs of urinary tract obstruction are useful and supportive findings in interpretation of the CT examination. In our experience, the most reliable signs indicating ureteral obstruction are hydroureter, hydronephrosis, periureteral oedema and unilateral renal enlargement, respectively. In addition, stones larger than 6 mm, located within the proximal two thirds of the ureter, and seen associated with five or more the secondary signs of obstruction, are more likely to require endoscopic removal and/or lithotripsy.

### Appropriate timing of performing abdominal ultrasonography and termination of follow-up observation for antenatal grade 1 or 2 hydronephrosis [^0b9badd4]. BMC Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Fetal hydronephrosis (HN) is the most common anomaly detected on antenatal ultrasonography, with an estimated prevalence of approximately 2–5.5%. In most cases, HN is diagnosed in the absence of urinary tract obstruction, when the anteroposterior diameter of the renal pelvis is just above the normal range for gestational age. Studies have shown that most cases of antenatal HN improve or resolve spontaneously with conservative treatment. The cases of 98% in the Society of Fetal Urology (SFU) grade 1or 2 HN improve or resolve in a systematic review of seven articles meta-analysis. The resolution rate of SFU grade 1 and 2 are reported to be 98–99% and 60–98% in two prospective studies. However, some patients do not show improvement or increase grade of HN, and a few cases need operation. The detection and postnatal follow-up of persistent antenatal HN is believed to help in the early recognition and prevention of progressive renal damage. There is no consensus on the duration of follow-up for cases of grade 1or 2 HN. In patients with SFU grades 1 and 2 HN, a more abbreviated follow-up may be warranted and could save costs. However, It has been pointed out that SFU grade 1 and grade 2 show different natural course, and there is concern whether similar follow-up may be acceptable for SFU grade 1 and grade 2. The aim of this study is to examine the hypothesis that there are different continuous follow-up period and new management for children with antenatal SFU grade 1or 2 HN.

### Hypertension and hydronephrosis: rapid resolution of high blood pressure following relief of bilateral ureteric obstruction [^b63469db]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Hypertension secondary to hydronephrosis is not commonly reported in the medical literature. Tubuloglomerular feedback and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis are thought to mediate this process. We describe a patient presenting with acute kidney injury and bilateral hydronephrosis secondary to pelvic malignancy in which peripheral venous renin and aldosterone were elevated. Her blood pressure improved rapidly following insertion of bilateral nephrostomies. The speed of resolution of hypertension following relief of obstruction suggests that humorally mediated vasoconstriction can play an important role in the mechanism by which hydronephrosis causes hypertension. We also discuss other causes of renal parenchymal compression that may lead to the development of hypertension.

Clinical Signs and Symptoms Clinical Effects and Time of Onset by Severity of Exposure to Sulfur Mustard. Decontamination Zone Decontamination within 1 or 2 minutes after exposure is the only effective means of decreasing the effects caused by ensuing tissue damage. ABC Reminders If the victim is symptomatic, immediately institute emergency life support measures. If warranted, treatment should be given simultaneously with decontamination procedures. Quickly ensure that the victim has a patent airway and is ventilating well. Assist ventilation with a bag-valve-mask device equipped with a canister or air filter if necessary. Maintain adequate circulation. Stabilize the cervical spine with a decontaminable collar and a backboard if trauma is suspected. Direct pressure should be applied to control heavy bleeding, if present.
- Flush exposed or irritated eyes with plain water or saline for at least 15 minutes by tilting the head to the side, pulling eyelids apart with fingers, and pouring water slowly into eyes. Remove contact lenses if easily removable without additional trauma to the eye. If a corrosive material is suspected or if pain or injury is evident, continue irrigation while transferring the victim to the Support Zone.
- Utilizing large amounts of water by itself is very effective.
- If water supplies are limited, and showers are not available an alternative form of decontamination is to use absorbent powders such as flour, talcum powder, or Fuller's earth. Treatment Area Treatment Area Treatment Area Re-Triage Following decontamination the patient should be reassessed; noting changes in triage category, the need for or the modification of supportive therapy.

ABC Reminders Quickly access airway patency. If trauma is suspected, maintain cervical immobilization manually and apply a cervical collar and a backboard when feasible. Ensure adequate respiration and pulse. Document oxygen saturation. Place on a cardiac monitor. Link to Primary and Secondary Survey If the patient is symptomatic, immediately institute emergency life support measures. Advanced Treatment In cases of respiratory compromise, secure airway and respiration via endotracheal intubation or laryngeal mask airway if unable to secure airway). There is no antidote for sulfur mustard toxicity. Decontamination within 1 or 2 minutes after exposure is the only effective means of.

### Variable resource utilization in the prenatal and postnatal management of isolated hydronephrosis [^5d020b4a]. Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To characterize contemporary resource utilization and medical outcomes for infants with antenatal hydronephrosis and their mothers from a national claims database. We hypothesize that management of isolated hydronephrosis (IHN) varies widely, with decreased imaging following the 2010 Society for Fetal Urology Consensus Statement.

Materials and Methods

Using MarketScan claims from 2007 to 2013, we identified infants 0–12 months of age with hydronephrosis and linked mothers. Those with urologic diagnoses more specific than hydronephrosis, additional urologic comorbidities, or postnatal surgeries were excluded. Resource utilization including prenatal and postnatal imaging, laboratory studies, hospital admissions, and medical outcomes within the first year was captured. Demographics, maternal characteristics, utilization measures, and outcomes were compared across imaging intensity groups based on number of postnatal ultrasounds received using bivariate analysis.

Results

Among 801,919 mother-child pairs, 8610 infants (1.1%) had hydronephrosis or a related diagnosis. A total of 5876 (68.2%) met inclusion criteria for IHN. Patients underwent a mean 5.3 ± 3.5 prenatal and 2.1 ± 1.3 postnatal ultrasounds before age 1. Imaging practices were unchanged following the Society for Fetal Urology consensus statement.

Conclusion

Antenatal hydronephrosis prevalence in an insured population is consistent with published ranges. Prenatal imaging in IHN is variable and potentially excessive. Future study into the efficacy of evidence-based pathways in reducing excess utilization is warranted.

Postnatal evaluation of prenatal hydronephrosis (PNH) offers the opportunity to diagnose and manage vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) before secondary damage occurs from urinary tract infection (UTI), and prior studies recognize that maldevelopment in the absence of infection can contribute to the clinical picture of "reflux nephropathy". Evaluation of affected infants could additionally provide insights into the benefits, if any, of early identification of VUR and institution of continuous antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent UTI, pyelonephritis and renal scarring.

Obstruction of a ureter secondary to tumor, fibrosis, or inflammation has been well documented in published reports. A review of English studies revealed no reported cases of hydronephrosis of a native kidney resulting from hyperstimulation of an ovary. We report a case of hydronephrosis in a woman undergoing ovarian stimulation for in vitro fertilization. Her presentation was prompted by symptoms of flank pain with nausea and vomiting. Management with ureteral stent placement was successful in relieving the obstructive symptoms. This case demonstrates the importance of imaging and close monitoring of symptoms in women undergoing in vitro fertilization.

### Clinical utility of gray scale renal ultrasound in acute kidney injury [^77ca6c6a]. BMC Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common among hospitalized patients with a reported prevalence of 2 to 35%. The presence of AKI is associated with worse hospital outcome, and even a modest increase in creatinine significantly increases mortality.

Evaluation to determine the cause of AKI includes review of the medical history and clinical course, routine blood biochemical measurements, and microscopic examination of the urine. Renal ultrasound (RUS) is often recommended in the evaluation of AKI to exclude the presence of hydronephrosis and urinary tract obstruction even when the pre-test probably for obstructive uropathy is low. Others have advocated a more restricted use of RUS given that the majority of cases of AKI in hospitalized patients are due to acute tubular necrosis or prerenal etiologies, and thus in most cases RUS results would not be expected to change management. In addition, the finding of hydronephrosis on ultrasound does not prove the presence of urinary tract obstruction since it is also seen in high urinary flow states such as with diuretic use, diabetes insipidus, pregnancy, previous obstruction, and congenital megaureter.

Doppler ultrasonography with determination of resistive indices is an active area of research, with potential diagnostic and clinical implications, but determination of resistive indices on native renal ultrasound is not yet standard practice.

Reducing the number of unnecessary RUS reduces direct costs. In addition, incidental renal lesions are frequently found, and the benefits of further evaluation and intervention for these incidental findings is unclear and could in some cases lead to harm.

The aim of this study was to assess the clinical utility of RUS in determining the cause of AKI in hospitalized patients. Our goal was to determine the frequency of abnormal findings on RUS, particularly the presence of hydronephrosis, and the clinical characteristics associated with higher likelihood of finding urinary tract obstruction.

Genitourinary tuberculosis — medical management, procedural indications, and diagnostics: Renal tuberculosis is treated primarily medically, and expert opinion is that a standard daily 6-month regimen is adequate. If ureteral obstruction occurs, procedures to relieve obstruction are indicated; in hydronephrosis with progressive renal insufficiency due to obstruction, renal drainage by stenting or nephrostomy is advised. Nephrectomy is considered for a nonfunctioning or poorly functioning kidney, particularly with hypertension or continuous flank pain. Dose adjustment is required when renal failure coexists. Genital tract tuberculosis generally responds to chemotherapy, though surgery may be indicated for residual large tubo-ovarian abscesses. A positive urine culture for M. tuberculosis is part of diagnostic assessment and may also occur in advanced HIV with disseminated or occult genitourinary involvement.

### The role of emergency ultrasound for evaluating acute pyelonephritis in the ED [^fc7ad54b]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Controversy remains over the imaging method of choice for evaluating acute pyelonephritis (APN) in the emergency department (ED).

Objective

The aim of the study was to determine the efficacy of ultrasound in the diagnosis and management of patients presented to the ED with APN.

Methods

This was a retrospective study of prospectively collected data. A cohort of ED patients diagnosed as APN were prospectively registered, and their medical records were then retrospectively reviewed for the presence of complications (admitted > 14 days, admission to intensive care unit, or received invasive procedures), significant abnormalities (hydronephrosis, polycystic kidney diseases, renal abscess, emphysematous pyelonephritis), and mild abnormalities (cysts, stones, swelling).

Results

The study included 243 patients. Most of the patients received one or more renal imaging studies (n = 206) and 39.5% of which were considered abnormal. The rates of significant abnormalities on different imaging methods were Kidney-ureter-bladder (KUB), 16.3%; emergency ultrasound (EUS), 39.6%; combination of KUB and EUS, 56.6%; and computed tomography, 58.8%. Factors contributed to complicated APN were elderly, male, a history of preexisting renal diseases, current use of catheters, previous renal calculi, and diabetes mellitus. Significant abnormalities can be identified by EUS in 61% of patients with complicated APN. In fact, the presence of significant sonographic abnormalities effectively diverted 34.3% of patients to receive surgical interventions (percutaneous nephrostomy, abscess aspiration, ureteroscopic stone manipulation, lithotripsy, or nephrectomy).

Conclusion

Structural abnormalities are not uncommon in ED patients with APN. Early assessment of these patients with EUS is likely to have a great impact on their diagnosis and management.

### Urinary tract infection: clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of the initial UTI in febrile infants and children 2 to 24 months [^7344a090]. Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To revise the American Academy of Pediatrics practice parameter regarding the diagnosis and management of initial urinary tract infections (UTIs) in febrile infants and young children.

Methods

Analysis of the medical literature published since the last version of the guideline was supplemented by analysis of data provided by authors of recent publications. The strength of evidence supporting each recommendation and the strength of the recommendation were assessed and graded.

Results

Diagnosis is made on the basis of the presence of both pyuria and at least 50,000 colonies per mL of a single uropathogenic organism in an appropriately collected specimen of urine. After 7 to 14 days of antimicrobial treatment, close clinical follow-up monitoring should be maintained to permit prompt diagnosis and treatment of recurrent infections. Ultrasonography of the kidneys and bladder should be performed to detect anatomic abnormalities. Data from the most recent 6 studies do not support the use of antimicrobial prophylaxis to prevent febrile recurrent UTI in infants without vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) or with grade I to IV VUR. Therefore, a voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) is not recommended routinely after the first UTI; VCUG is indicated if renal and bladder ultrasonography reveals hydronephrosis, scarring, or other findings that would suggest either high-grade VUR or obstructive uropathy and in other atypical or complex clinical circumstances. VCUG should also be performed if there is a recurrence of a febrile UTI. The recommendations in this guideline do not indicate an exclusive course of treatment or serve as a standard of care; variations may be appropriate. Recommendations about antimicrobial prophylaxis and implications for performance of VCUG are based on currently available evidence. As with all American Academy of Pediatrics clinical guidelines, the recommendations will be reviewed routinely and incorporate new evidence, such as data from the Randomized Intervention for Children With Vesicoureteral Reflux (RIVUR) study.

Conclusions

Changes in this revision include criteria for the diagnosis of UTI and recommendations for imaging.

### Association between severity of prenatally diagnosed hydronephrosis and receipt of surgical intervention postnatally among patients seen at a fetal-maternal center [^ae0064c0]. BMC Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Hydronephrosis (HN) is a descriptive term for dilation of one or both kidneys. It is the most common prenatal abnormality detected by ultrasound and is diagnosed in one to five percent of pregnancies. Increased prenatal screening has enabled physicians to diagnose prenatal HN more readily. Renal ultrasonography (US) and voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) are often performed postnatally for physicians to assess renal function and consider treatment plans.

The Society for Fetal Urology (SFU) has categorized the severity of HN into grades 1–4. This system takes into consideration the degree of pelvic dilation, presence of calyceal dilation, and thinning of parenchymal tissue in the kidneys. Despite advances in prenatal ultrasound screening for HN, there is still some ambiguity in criteria for diagnosing severity and appropriate management. There is debate about the cutoff values for the SFU grading system, though efforts have been made by various professional groups to consolidate findings into a more comprehensible management guide for practicing urologists. Another highly contested matter is the threshold at which surgical intervention is needed. Gender, age, and the presence of urological comorbidities are factors that must also be considered during the course of treatment.

### Management of genitourinary injuries [^7e98c5f4]. ACS (2025). High credibility.

Ureteral injury — imaging and staging: In a stable patient with a suspected ureteral injury who is not undergoing exploratory laparotomy, obtain an intravenous (IV) contrast-enhanced abdominal/pelvic computed tomography (CT) with a delayed-phase to evaluate for ureteral injury; IV contrast-enhanced abdominal/pelvic CT with a delayed-phase is recommended for evaluation of suspected ureteral injury. CT findings that raise the index of suspicion for ureteral injury include periureteral fluid and ipsilateral delayed nephrogram, as well as hydronephrosis, and delayed-phase CT findings diagnostic of ureteral injury include contrast extravasation, while lack of opacification of the ureter distal to the area of suspected injury is suggestive. When CT imaging is inconclusive and ureteral injury is suspected, adjunctive imaging techniques can aid in diagnosis, cystoscopy with a retrograde pyelography (RPG) may be performed in equivocal cases, direct inspection of the ureter remains the gold standard for suspected injuries, and intraoperative single-shot IV pyelography cannot reliably exclude ureteral injuries, so do not use it solely for this purpose. Retrograde pyelography (RPG) performed by a urologist is the most accurate imaging test to evaluate the location and extent of ureteral injury with equivocal CT findings.

### Urinary retention evaluation and catheterization algorithm for adult inpatients [^192e85d8]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Urinary catheters are commonly used in hospitalized medical and surgical patients. However, there are no guidelines or widely accepted algorithms for screening and management of urinary retention (UR) in these patients. Balancing the potential complications of untreated UR (eg, pain, bladder dysfunction) against those of urinary catheterization (eg, urethral injury, urinary tract infection) is necessary when deciding whether to insert a catheter.,

Although UR algorithms exist for outpatient populations, there is limited evidence to guide management in hospitalized patients. Outpatient surgical populations are generally healthier and undergo less-invasive procedures than those requiring inpatient care, limiting the generalizability of outpatient recommendations. Algorithms for outpatients use symptoms and risk stratification (eg, hydronephrosis, recurrent infections) to guide catheterization recommendations instead of postvoid residual volumes commonly used in hospitals. Inpatients may experience evolving disease processes and changing medications and fluid volumes that acutely impact bladder function and voiding. To improve the quality and consistency of care for hospitalized adult medical and surgical patients with UR, we aimed to use a systematic, multidisciplinary approach based on evidence, expert opinion, and feedback from frontline medical professionals to develop and refine a urinary retention evaluation and catheterization algorithm (URECA).

### Acute renal failure due to adenovirus-associated obstructive uropathy and necrotizing tubulointerstitial nephritis in a bone marrow transplant recipient [^4d51c12e]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2003). Low credibility.

Management of post-transplant complications caused by severe adenoviral infection remains a major therapeutic challenge. A 17-year-old male who had undergone bone marrow transplantation for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia developed complete anuria following hemorrhagic cystitis 34 days after the transplant procedure. The computed tomogram scan revealed bilateral hydronephrosis, indicating acute renal failure because of obstructive uropathy. The emergency procedure of percutaneous nephrostomy caused massive bleeding in the left kidney, which eventually required a nephrectomy. Adenovirus-positive severe necrotizing tubulointerstitial nephritis was the histopathological diagnosis. Post-transplant acute renal failure because of hydronephrosis, which could be complicated by adenovirus-induced renal parenchymal disease, is of great concern and may cause significant problems with interventional treatment.

### Urinary biomarkers in prenatally diagnosed unilateral hydronephrosis [^21184e28]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2011). Low credibility.

The introduction of prenatal ultrasonography as a screening method entails an increasing number of infants diagnosed with prenatal hydronephrosis. Ureteropelvic junction obstruction accounts for 35% of prenatal hydronephrotic cases. Urinary tract obstruction that occurs during early kidney development affects renal morphogenesis, maturation and growth, and in the most severe cases this will ultimately cause renal insufficiency. A major challenge in the clinical management of these patients is to preserve renal function by selection of the 15%-20% who require early surgical intervention, leaving those for whom watchful waiting may be appropriate because of spontaneous resolution/stabilization without significant loss of renal function. Today, this requires medical surveillance, including repetitive invasive diuretic renograms relying on arbitrary threshold values, and therefore there is a need for non-arbitrary, non-invasive urinary biomarkers that may be used as predictors for renal structural changes and/or decreasing renal function, and thereby provide the surgeon with more clear indications for surgical intervention. In this review, we summarize the currently well-known facts about urinary biomarkers in ureteropelvic junction obstruction concerning renal function, and we also suggest potential novel urinary biomarkers.

Magnetic Resonance Urography

Magnetic resonance urography is a radiation-sparing imaging technique that provides both anatomic detail and functional information and should be considered in children with known and complex urological conditions.

Referral

When there is an ongoing risk of renal damage that is unlikely to improve without surgical intervention, referral to a pediatric nephro/urology team is important. This is most common for children with significant urological abnormalities, including high-grade VUR (GRADE D).

Children with significant urological abnormalities, including but not limited to ureteric obstruction, duplex kidneys with VUR, grades 3–5 VUR, grades 3–4 hydronephrosis and neurogenic bladder, should be discussed acutely with and referred promptly to a pediatric nephro/urology team. High-grade VUR may persist without intervention. Evaluation of bladder function through urodynamics performed by urologists should be considered with recurrent UTI or with anatomical or functional abnormalities, as the investigation may detect abnormalities such as manageable detrusor overactivity or dysfunctional voiding.

We present here a few basic proposals for algorithms and procedures for imaging the paediatric genitourinary tract based on initial discussion at a paediatric uroradiology symposium and proposals of the ESUR Paediatric Uroradiologic Guidelines Subcommittee. These recommendations were developed in the light of new knowledge that might influence existing guidelines. Regional, individual and local flexibility and variability should be preserved in order to make these recommendations applicable throughout Europe. They should help standardize dedicated imaging not only in terms of a quality measure to ensure state-of-the-art patient care, but also in forming a common basis for multi-institutional research. There is an urgent need for these guidelines in order to advance our understanding of the subject and to gain evidence and improve imaging efficacy. Our session worked towards establishing an agreement on imaging indications in common paediatric urological conditions, respecting the ALARA principle, and patient safety and care, and taking into account state of the art knowledge and efficacy aspects. We started the task with a reassessment of (1) imaging in urinary tract infection in infants and children, (2) postnatal imaging in mild-to-moderate neonatal hydronephrosis, (3) how to perform voiding cystourethrography, and (4) procedural recommendations for paediatric urosonography. This list is incomplete, and future recommendations will be developed, discussed and presented at forthcoming meetings.

Relationship between outcome at 3 months and KDIGO class of renal failure before intervention

Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) class of renal failure was determined from the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). An eGFR of 45 mL per min per 1.73 m 2 was chosen as the threshold that might allow future chemotherapy.

During the study interval, 758 patients (89.0%) died with a median survival of 6 (i.q.r. 2–14) months. A total of 72 individuals (8.5%) died within 30 days of intervention, 236 (27.7%) within 90 days, 373 (43.8%) within 6 months, and 528 (62.0%) within 1 year. Oncological treatment (surgery, systemic therapy or radiotherapy) was administered after decompression to 366 patients (43.0%). Of the patients who did not proceed to oncological treatment, 72 (14.8%) underwent decompression because of hydronephrosis on imaging and/or for optimization for further intervention, 244 (50.2%) underwent decompression owing to acute kidney injury (AKI) and/or sepsis, 2 (0.4%) because of pain, and in 168 (34.6%) the indication unknown.

Patient, radiological, haematological, and biochemical parameters relevant to OS were assessed by Cox regression (Table 2). In the adjusted model, age, metastatic disease at time of intervention, bilateral hydronephrosis, low haemoglobin, high potassium, high white cell count, and high CRP level were associated with worse OS. Although there were differences in OS based on cancer type on unadjusted analysis, after adjustment this only held true for prostate cancer and lymphoma.

### Appropriate timing of performing abdominal ultrasonography and termination of follow-up observation for antenatal grade 1 or 2 hydronephrosis [^88375b0c]. BMC Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Most cases of antenatal HN improve or resolve spontaneously with conservative treatment. However, some patients do not show improvement without treatment. No consensus currently exists regarding the optimal schedule and duration of follow-up with SFU grade 1 or 2 HN. It is unclear which neonates require postnatal evaluation, when postnatal evaluation for HN should be performed, how long follow-up should be continued, how long an examination should be performed.

The timing of postnatal resolution of HN is quite variable, occurring over the first few years of life. Despite variabilities in the underlying diagnoses, mild grades of HN generally show early resolution, with most cases of SFU grade 1–2 HN resolving within 12–18 months of age. In our study, most cases of SFU grade 1–2 HN showed natural improvement or resolution within 4 years of age. In particular, since SFU grade 2 HN resolve more slowly than grade 1 on the early follow-up, the follow-up period is likely to be longer for many cases. However, A small number of cases showed worsening from SFU grade 1 to 2 or SFU grade 2 to 3, and this worsening was mainly noted within 6 months of age in our study. In SFU grade 2, the HN grade that increased within 6 months was a change to the higher risk SFU grade 3, so careful observation may be required for SFU grade 2 during this period. A previous study reported the need for surgical intervention in a small percentage of cases of mild-grade HN. In another previous report, of 225 kidneys with SFU grade 2 HN, 3 showed worsening of HN to a severe grade. Furthermore, following SFU grade 3 cases, there are cases that finally required surgery, so it is concluded that more closely monitoring is required than SFU grade 2. Previous study has been suggested that SFU grade 1 may be more physiologic in nature. If SFU grade 1 persists in perpetuity without need for intervention, perhaps it does not need to be followed as aggressively. We think that 6 months and 1 years SFU grade 1 patients should undergo ultrasonography at the time when the grade of HN may worse. After that, it is considered safe to stop close follow-up and spread the follow-up interval to about 1 year for stable cases. On the other hand, in SFU grade 2 patients, there is a possibility of worsening high grade of HN at 6 months or less, so it is considered necessary to perform serial ultrasonography. However, after that period, it will be possible to spread the follow-up interval as with SFU grade 1.

### Pelvic lipomatosis associated with bilateral obstructive uropathy and proliferative cystitis [^5d3c1969]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Pelvic lipomatosis is a rare benign entity characterised by excessive deposition of adipose tissue in the perirectal and perivesical spaces. We describe a 43-year-old man with bilateral distal ureteral obstruction secondary to pelvic lipomatosis with concomitant proliferative cystitis resulting in severe hydronephrosis. We performed urinary diversion with percutaneous nephrostomy tube insertion to prevent further renal impairment. The patient was advised close follow-up to monitor the increased risk of bladder adenocarcinoma transformation observed in patients with cystitis glandularis. This report, compliant with the CARE (CAse REport) guidelines for clinical case reporting, presents another case of pelvic lipomatosis associated with acute kidney failure, bilateral hydronephrosis and proliferative cystitis without urodynamic evidence of bladder outlet obstruction that may serve to guide urologists in managing patients with a similar profile.

### Management and screening of primary vesicoureteral reflux in children [^d981399f]. AUA (2017). Medium credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for congenital hydronephrosis, more specifically with respect to voiding cystourethrography, AUA 2017 guidelines recommend to obtain voiding cystourethrography in patients with a history of prenatal hydronephrosis and high-grade hydronephrosis (SFU grades 3–4), hydroureter, or an abnormal bladder on ultrasound (late-term prenatal or postnatal), or developing a UTI on observation.

### Pyelonephritis and obstructive uropathy: a case of acute kidney injury [^145ef219]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

We present a case of a man in his late 50s with a history of metastatic prostate carcinoma requiring bilateral ureteric stenting. He was admitted with increasing confusion and lethargy. He was diagnosed with sepsis and an acute kidney injury (AKI). Clinical suspicions of an obstructive component to his AKI were not confirmed by an ultrasound scan, which showed a unilateral hydronephrosis unchanged from a scan 1month previously. A nephrostomy was performed, and frank pus aspirated. The patient's clinical state improved steadily thereafter. Patients who are dehydrated, or who have suffered from malignant or fibrotic processes affecting the retroperitoneum, may present with urinary obstruction without a corresponding increase in urinary tract dilation. Additionally, there must be a suspicion of pyonephrosis in a symptomatic patient with known hydronephrosis. Clinicians should be aware that clinical suspicions of urinary obstruction not demonstrated on ultrasound scanning require further investigation.

### Untethering an unusual cause of kidney injury in a teenager with down syndrome [^bf83d8d8]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2014). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is characterized by the acute nature and the inability of kidneys to maintain fluid homeostasis as well as adequate electrolyte and acid-base balance, resulting in an accumulation of nitrogenous waste and elevation of serum blood urea nitrogen and creatinine values. Acute kidney injury may be a single isolated event, yet oftentimes, it results from an acute chronic kidney disease. It is critical to seek out the etiology of AKI and to promptly manage the underlying chronic kidney disease to prevent comorbidities and mortality that may ensue. We described a case of a 16-year-old adolescent girl with Down syndrome who presented with AKI and electrolyte aberrance. Abdominal and renal ultrasounds demonstrated a significantly dilated bladder as well as frank hydronephrosis and hydroureter bilaterally. Foley catheter was successful in relieving the obstruction and improving her renal function. However, a magnetic resonance imaging was pursued in light of her chronic constipation and back pain, and it revealed a structural defect (tethered cord) that underlies a chronic process that was highly likely contributory to her AKI. She was managed accordingly with a guarded result and required long-term and close monitoring.

### Standards of reporting for interventional radiology treatment of renal and pancreatic transplantation complications [^7c457453]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2012). Medium credibility.

Obstructive uropathy and nephropathy/ureteral obstruction — ureteral obstruction causing hydronephrosis is termed obstructive uropathy, and if an anatomic correlate is lacking as the cause of the obstruction, the term "functional obstruction" applies. For grading of hydronephrosis, the traditional mild/moderate/severe classification may be used, and obstructive uropathy is more specifically referred to as obstructive nephropathy when structural, biochemical, and functional renal alterations ensue.

### Outcomes of intermediate-risk hydronephrosis in pediatric patients [^63b0632d]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Hydronephrosis is a common antenatal diagnosis and is present in approximately 1–5% of pregnancies. The urinary tract dilation (UTD) classification system was introduced in 2014 and stratifies post-natal hydronephrosis risk into three groups: low-risk (P1), intermediate-risk (P2), and high-risk (P3). Recommendations for P3 hydronephrosis have been established, whereas those for P1 and P2 UTD are often left to the discretion of providers with P1 considered low-grade and less concerning significant pathology. Given the obscure nature of P2 hydronephrosis, we sought to determine the natural history and outcomes of pediatric patients with P2 hydronephrosis within a single institution.

Materials and Methods

Children < 18 years old diagnosed with hydronephrosis between January 2015 and December 2018 were identified by ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes. Patients with P1 hydronephrosis, P3 hydronephrosis, known vesicoureteral reflux, complex anomalies (ex. Posterior urethral valve), neurological impairments, neurogenic bladder secondary to spinal abnormalities, and < 6 months of follow-up were excluded. The development of urinary tract infection (UTI; ≥ 100 000 CFU/mL of bacterial growth, UA > 10 WBCs/hpf with fever > 38C), need for surgical intervention (impaired renal function, worsening hydronephrosis, and/or delayed drainage on diuretic renography), and stability of hydronephrosis were collected retrospectively.

Results

Eighty-seven patients [105 renal units (RU)] were included. Twenty-six patients (30%) were female and 61 (70%) were male. Of the male patients, 30 (49%) of them were circumcised. The median age at initial evaluation was 1 month, and the median duration of follow-up was 13 months. Thirty-four (32%) RU had complete resolution, 24 (23%) improved to P1 hydronephrosis, 33 (31%) remained stable, and 14 (13%) progressed to P3 hydronephrosis. The median duration to resolution and improvement was 8.5 months and 5 months, respectively. Eleven (11%) RU required surgical intervention, 10 of which underwent pyeloplasty, with a median duration to intervention of 9 months. Fifty-five patients (63%) received antibiotic prophylaxis (amoxicillin or sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim) for a median duration of 5 months. Nine patients (10%) developed a UTI, 3 of which were taking antibiotic prophylaxis at the time of infection.

Conclusions

Intermediate-risk hydronephrosis diagnosed in the pediatric population will either improve, resolve, or remain stable during 1-year follow-up in 87% of RU. Only 11% of RU required surgical intervention, and 19% of patients developed a UTI in the absence of antibiotic prophylaxis. These findings will assist with counseling parents concerning the importance of follow-up imaging and monitoring for UTI. However, the low risk of surgical intervention is encouraging and should be discussed with the children's caretakers.

### Clinical outcome and management of ureteral obstruction secondary to gastric cancer [^518423b5]. World Journal of Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Background

The clinical outcome of ureteral obstruction secondary to gastric cancer remains unclear. The present study was designed to evaluate the clinical outcome and predictive factors of survival in patients with ureteral obstruction secondary to gastric cancer.

Methods

Twenty-five consecutive patients with ureteral obstruction secondary to gastric cancer between January 1998 and December 2007 were retrospectively analyzed. All patients had hydronephrosis; 13 patients had bilateral hydronephrosis, and 12 patients had unilateral hydronephrosis.

Results

Ten patients presented with pain, 3 patients with urinary tract infection, and 2 patients with acute renal failure. Seven (58%) of 12 patients with unilateral ureteral obstruction experienced progression to bilateral ureteral obstruction during the follow-up period. Eighteen patients (61%) were eventually managed with urinary diversion. In total, 5 patients were managed with percutaneous nephrostomy, and 15 patients with retrograde ureteral stenting. All symptomatic patients responded to urinary diversion. The overall median survival was 5.8 months, and the 6-month and 1-year survival rates were 48 and 32%, respectively. Chemotherapy was found to be the only independent predictor of survival (p = 0.0498). Median survival in patients who received chemotherapy was 11.2 months, in comparison to 3.1 months in patients who did not receive chemotherapy (p = 0.0002).

Conclusions

The prognosis of ureteral obstruction secondary to gastric cancer was extremely poor, particularly when chemotherapy was not administered. The indications for palliative urinary diversion should be determined after considering the patient's symptoms, the expected survival time, the possibility of further chemotherapeutic options, and the current quality of life.

### AUA white paper on nonneurogenic chronic urinary retention: consensus definition, treatment algorithm, and outcome end points [^c2d66840]. The Journal of Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

The AUA (American Urological Association) QIPS (Quality Improvement and Patient Safety) committee created a white paper on the diagnosis and management of nonneurogenic chronic urinary retention.

Materials and Methods

Recommendations for the white paper were based on a review of the literature and consensus expert opinion from the workgroup.

Results

The workgroup defined nonneurogenic chronic urinary retention as an elevated post-void residual of greater than 300 mL that persisted for at least 6 months and documented on 2 or more separate occasions. It is proposed that chronic urinary retention should be categorized by risk (high vs low) and symptomatology (symptomatic versus asymptomatic). High risk chronic urinary retention was defined as hydronephrosis on imaging, stage 3 chronic kidney disease or recurrent culture proven urinary tract infection or urosepsis. Symptomatic chronic urinary retention was defined as subjectively moderate to severe urinary symptoms impacting quality of life and/or a recent history of catheterization. A treatment algorithm was developed predicated on stratifying patients with chronic urinary retention first by risk and then by symptoms. The proposed 4 primary outcomes that should be assessed to determine effectiveness of retention treatment are 1) symptom improvement, 2) risk reduction, 3) successful trial of voiding without catheterization, and 4) stability of symptoms and risk over time.

Conclusions

Defining and categorizing nonneurogenic chronic urinary retention, creating a treatment algorithm and proposing treatment end points will hopefully spur comparative research that will ultimately lead to a better understanding of this challenging condition.

### Summary of the AUA guideline on management of primary vesicoureteral reflux in children [^4ced9816]. The Journal of Urology (2010). Medium credibility.

AUA guideline — voiding cystourethrogram indications in children with vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) state that voiding cystourethrogram is recommended for children with high-grade (Society of Fetal Urology grade 3 and 4) hydronephrosis, hydroureter or an abnormal bladder on ultrasound (late term prenatal or postnatal), or who develop a urinary tract infection on observation; based on review of the data and Panel consensus. For prenatally detected hydronephrosis (SFU grade 1 or 2), an observational approach without screening for VUR, with prompt treatment of any urinary tract infection, may be taken, and it is also considered an option to perform a voiding cystourethrogram in these patients to screen for VUR; based on Panel consensus.

### Successful management of a giant anterior sacral meningocele with an endoscopic cutting stapler: case report [^5b4ffc1a]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2016). Low credibility.

Anterior sacral meningoceles (ASMs) are rare defects in the sacrum with thecal sac herniations and symptoms that commonly include constipation, dysmenorrhea, and urinary disturbances. An ASM causing hydronephrosis and acute renal failure from compression of the lower portion of the urinary tract is a rare clinical entity. Only one other case has been reported. The authors present the case of a 37-year-old man admitted for obstructive renal failure and hydronephrosis due to a giant ASM that measured 25 × 12 × 18 cm and compressed the ureters and bladder. The ASM was successfully treated via an anterior transabdominal approach in which the authors used a novel technique for watertight closure of the meningocele pedicle with an endoscopic cutting stapler. The authors review the literature and discuss the surgical options for the treatment of ASMs, specifically the management of ASMs in the context of obstructive renal failure and hydronephrosis.

### Current diagnosis and management of fetal genitourinary abnormalities [^2280577c]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Prenatal assessment with ultrasonography provides excellent imaging of fluid-filled structures (eg, hydronephrosis, renal cysts, and dilated bladder) and renal parenchyma. This information allows for the generation of a differential diagnosis, identification of associated anomalies, and assessment of the prenatal and postnatal risks of a given anomaly. This enhances parental education and prenatal and postnatal planning. This article discusses the current methods of diagnosis and management of fetal genitourinary anomalies, and also the postnatal evaluation and treatment of these conditions.

### Systemic inflammatory response syndrome in patients with acute obstructive upper tract urinary stone: a risk factor for urgent renal drainage and revisit to the emergency department [^5818cbeb]. BMC Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

In patients seen in the emergency department (ED) with acute stone obstruction many risk factors that indicate need for urgent renal drainage are known. However, in patients discharged from ED without renal drainage factors that can minimize revisit to the emergency department are not fully identified. We evaluated SIRS (systemic inflammatory response syndrome) as a risk factor for urgent renal drainage and revisit to the ED in patients with acute stone colic during their ED visit.

Methods

Retrospective review was performed of patients presenting to a tertiary academic emergency department (ED) from an obstructing ureteral or UPJ stone with hydronephrosis confirmed on an abdominal and pelvic CT scan. Data evaluated over a 3-year period included stone size, presence of UTI, presence or absence of SIRS and other clinical variables as risk factors for urgent renal drainage and ED revisits.

Results

1983 patients with urolithiasis were seen at the ED and 649 patients had obstructive urolithiasis on CT scan. SIRS was diagnosed in 15% (99/649) patients. 54/99 (55%) patients with SIRS underwent urgent renal drainage compared to 99/550 (17%) in non-SIRS patients. In a multivariate analysis SIRS was a predictor of urgent intervention compared to non-SIRS patients (odds ratio 4.6, p < 0.05). SIRS was also associated with increased risk for revisits to the ED (6.9% with SIRS vs. 2.4% with no SIRS, odds ratio 2.9, p = 0.05).

Conclusions

Presence of SIRS in obstructive urolithiasis patients was an independent risk factor of acute urologic intervention and revisits to the ED. A timely consultation with a urologist following discharge from ED for obstructive stone patients with SIRS who had no acute renal drainage may prevent revisit to the ED. Evaluation for SIRS in addition to other clinical risk factors should be considered while making management decision in patients with acute stone obstruction.

### Predicting the success of retrograde stenting for managing ureteral obstruction [^86ed0616]. The Journal of Urology (2001). Low credibility.

Purpose

Retrograde ureteral stenting is often considered the first line option for relieving ureteral obstruction when temporary drainage is indicated. Several retrospective studies have implied that in cases of extrinsic obstruction retrograde ureteral stenting may fail and, therefore, percutaneous nephrostomy drainage is required. We examined the efficacy of retrograde ureteral stenting for resolving ureteral obstruction and identified clinical and radiological parameters predicting failure.

Materials and Methods

Enrolled in our prospective study were 92 consecutive patients with ureteral obstruction, which was bilateral in 8. Retrograde ureteral stenting was attempted in all cases by the urologist on call. When stent insertion failed, drainage was achieved by percutaneous nephrostomy. Patients were followed at 3-week intervals for 3 months. Each followup visit included a medical interview, blood evaluation, urine culture and ultrasound. Stent malfunction was defined as continuous flank pain manifesting as recurrent episodes of acute renal colic, 1 or more episodes of pyelonephritis, persistent hydronephrosis or elevated creatinine. Preoperative data and outcomes were compared in cases of intrinsic and extrinsic obstruction. Univariate and multivariate analysis was done to identify predictors of the failure of ureteral stent insertion and long-term function.

Results

The etiology of obstruction was intrinsic in 61% of patients and extrinsic in 39%. Extrinsic obstruction, which was associated with a greater degree of hydronephrosis, was located more distal. Retrograde ureteral stenting was successful in 94% and 73% of patients with intrinsic and extrinsic obstruction, respectively. At the 3-month followup stent function was maintained in all patients with intrinsic obstruction but in only 56.4% with extrinsic obstruction. On multivariate logistic regression the type of obstruction, level of obstruction and degree of hydronephrosis were the only predictors of stent function at 3 months. Stent diameter and preoperative creatinine had no predictive value.

Conclusions

Retrograde ureteral stenting is a good solution for most acutely obstructed ureters. In patients with extrinsic ureteral obstruction a more distal level of obstruction and higher degree of hydronephrosis are associated with a greater likelihood of stent failure. These patients may be better served by percutaneous drainage.

### Clinical utility of gray scale renal ultrasound in acute kidney injury [^bc8df3bc]. BMC Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Hydronephrosis

Demographic and clinical characteristics for patients with AKI are presented in Table 4 according to the presence or absence of hydronephrosis. Age 65 years or older, prior diagnosis of abdominal malignancy, and a history of nephrolithiasis were each associated with a higher likelihood of finding hydronephrosis on RUS. The presence of any one of the group of multiple other medical conditions thought to predispose to urinary tract obstruction (neurogenic bladder, retroperitoneal fibrosis, prior ectopic pregnancy, prior pelvic or renal surgery, prior pelvic inflammatory disease, and abdominal trauma) was also associated with a higher likelihood of detecting hydronephrosis on ultrasound.

Table 4
Presence of hydronephrosis according to patient characteristics among patients with AKI

Data are presented as n (%).

Abbreviations: Cr creatinine, RUS renal ultrasound, BPH benign prostatic hypertrophy.

*Other includes neurogenic bladder, retroperitoneal fibrosis, congenital renal or urinary tract anomaly, prior pelvic surgery, prior ectopic pregnancy, prior pelvic inflammatory disease, prior surgery on kidney for reason other than cancer, and abdominal trauma.

†Bivariate logistic regression.

By multivariable logistic regression a history of abdominal cancer was associated with over 3-fold higher odds of finding hydronephrosis in AKI and reached statistical significance. Having a medical condition in the broad group encompassing other factors thought to predispose to urinary tract obstruction (neurogenic bladder, retroperitoneal fibrosis, prior ectopic pregnancy, prior pelvic or renal surgery, prior pelvic inflammatory disease, and abdominal trauma) was associated with 7-fold higher odds of hydronephrosis. Patients aged 65 years or older had over twice the odds of hydronephrosis being found by renal ultrasound in the setting of AKI (Table 5).

### Clinical utility of gray scale renal ultrasound in acute kidney injury [^5c65986b]. BMC Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Discussion

Acute kidney injury is a common occurrence in hospitalized patients and is associated with significantly increased morbidity and mortality. Although the most common causes of AKI in this population are sepsis, acute tubular necrosis, and pre-renal states, RUS is often obtained to detect hydronephrosis and possible urinary tract obstruction. However, the indiscriminate use of this procedure increases cost and may expose patients to further unnecessary interventions, and thus restricted use of RUS has been advocated. In this retrospective review of RUS use at a large teaching hospital over a 3-year period, we found that over 800 studies were performed for the evaluation of AKI. Hydronephrosis was detected in only slightly more than 5% of patients, and in less than half of them (2.3%) was the cause of AKI attributable to urinary tract obstruction. More often the hydronephrosis was mild and considered an incidental finding. This observation is consistent with a previous study that showed that 11% of patients with AKI were found to have hydronephrosis on RUS unrelated to their renal failure.

Doppler evaluation of renal blood flow was performed in almost half of the renal ultrasounds, and resulted in only 7 additional clinically relevant findings. It is notable, however, that resistive indices are not routinely reported on native kidney renal ultrasounds at our institution, so we are unable to comment on the utility of this metric which may provide prognostic and diagnostic information in AKI.

We found that several characteristics were independently associated with the finding of hydronephrosis by RUS in AKI. Age 65 or greater, prior abdominal malignancy, or any one of a grouping of several factors that could affect the urinary tract (neurogenic bladder, retroperitoneal fibrosis, prior ectopic pregnancy, prior pelvic or renal surgery, prior pelvic inflammatory disease, and abdominal trauma) were all associated with an statistically significant increased likelihood of detecting hydronephrosis. This is consistent with the previously reported results of Licurse et al. showing that history of abdominal anatomic abnormality, BPH, or neoplasia conferred a significantly higher risk of finding hydronephrosis on renal ultrasound.

### Acute renal papillary necrosis with complete bilateral ureteral obstruction in a child [^421d304f]. Urology (2007). Low credibility.

A 9-year-old girl presented with apparent meningococcal septicemia and developed acute renal failure after 48 hours of treatment with antibiotics and analgesics. Early ultrasound scanning demonstrated mild bilateral hydronephrosis and hydroureter. Intravenous urography showed slow contrast uptake with delay nephrogram and no contrast entering the bladder. Repeat ultrasonography revealed bilateral papillary irregularity and echogenic debris in the distal ureters. Bilateral double-J stents were inserted cystoscopically, resulting in prompt polyuria and a return of normal renal function. Although rare, recognition of sloughed papilla in papillary necrosis causing ureteral obstruction can lead to early management with no long-term sequelae.

### Ureteric stent versus percutaneous nephrostomy for acute ureteral obstruction-clinical outcome and quality of life: a bi-center prospective study [^04191350]. BMC Urology (2019). Medium credibility.

There are several limitations to our study. The "tube symptoms" questionnaire was based on a validated DJS symptoms questionnaire, adjusted to be relevant for both DJS and PCN groups, but was not validated in itself or to local language, and might induce recall bias. As both hospitals are public, at no cost to the patient, procedural or hospitalization cost did not introduce bias. However, selection bias may have been introduced through choice of drainage procedure according to surgeon's preference, recruitment rate, possibly influenced by severity of eGFR, hydronephrosis, or other unmeasured parameters. Therefore patients suspected of long standing impaction probably had a higher chance of receiving a PCN, thus explaining the lower GFR in this group. Furthermore, as different imaging modalities were used, we could not assess hydronephrosis severity as a possible confounder. Finally, we did not assess a third time point, after tube removal, to confirm symptoms resolution. Nevertheless, we believe our study, supported by other past reports, demonstrate an overlooked truth. To quote Dr. Louis R Kavoussi, "Traditionally, urologists have placed stents because… that's what we do", but his experience is that "patients are more comfortable with a nephrostomy than a stent". Interestingly, superior QoL of PCN over DJS placed after PCNL was also recently reported. The results of this study support superior QoL of nephrostomy tube over time, and may cause some urologists to reconsider their choice of renal drainage, especially in health systems in which definitive treatment might be delayed. Undoubtedly, the specific tube symptoms, and their influence of the patient over time, should be given a serious consideration in the deliberation for the right drainage method for a specific patient.

### Duodenal perforation and right hydronephrosis due to toothpick ingestion [^4dcc25fb]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

We report a case of a 36-year-old man who was admitted to the Emergency Department with right flank pain. The clinical presentation was suggestive of renal colic. However, a computed tomography scan showed the presence of a foreign body in the inferior duodenal flexure. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy demonstrated a 6.5-cm wooden toothpick deeply embedded in the duodenal wall; this was removed via endoscopy. The peri-duodenal inflammatory reaction had encased the right ureter, resulting in hydronephrosis. The patient did well and was discharged on post-operative day 7. He did not recall toothpick ingestion. When evaluating patients with acute abdominal pain, foreign body ingestion should be considered. In patients with a history of toothpick ingestion, immediate diagnosis with endoscopic management should be performed.

### A review of sonographic evaluation of renal transplant complications [^b93f46b9]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2008). Low credibility.

In this article, we present an overview of renal transplantation with its complications and discuss the abilities and limitations of ultrasound in evaluating these complications. We included renal transplants performed at our institution between 1993 and 2006 and gathered data on more than 1,000 patients who developed graft dysfunction. We analyzed the ultrasound findings in different posttransplant complications and compared our findings with those in published literature. We present this review article that elaborates and categorizes various transplant complications from an ultrasound perspective. Based on imaging evaluation, the complications of renal transplantation can be divided into four major categories: peri-renal, renal parenchymal, renal collecting system, and renal vascular complications. Common complications included acute tubular necrosis, graft rejection, drug nephrotoxicity, hematoma, lymphocele, urinoma, hydronephrosis, and vascular complications. Ultrasound has a key role in identification and management of most of these complications. However, some parenchymal complications may only be diagnosed on renal biopsy. Ultrasound is a very powerful screening tool to assess renal transplant dysfunction and has a primary role in early diagnosis and management of structural and vascular complications, which may need surgical intervention to save the graft.

### Prenatal hydronephrosis [^9be4ac0b]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Hydronephrosis is the most common genitourinary tract anomaly identified on prenatal ultrasound studies. Ureteropelvic junction obstruction accounts for approximately 50% of the cases of prenatally detected hydronephrosis. Postnatal evaluation allows for the identification of the cause and further management. Rarely, in utero intervention may be performed for severe oligohydramnios associated with hydronephrosis. Prenatal consultation with a pediatric urologist is useful in decreasing parental anxiety and facilitating postnatal management.

### Point-of-care ultrasound for the pediatric hospitalist's practice [^81759e2b]. Hospital Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) has the potential to provide real-time valuable information that could alter diagnosis, treatment, and management practices in pediatric hospital medicine. We review the existing pediatric POCUS literature to identify potential clinical applications within the scope of pediatric hospital medicine. Diagnostic point-of-care applications most relevant to the pediatric hospitalist include lung ultrasound for pneumothorax, pleural effusion, pneumonia, and bronchiolitis; cardiac ultrasound for global cardiac function and hydration status; renal or bladder ultrasound for nephrolithiasis, hydronephrosis, and bladder volumes; soft tissue ultrasound for differentiating cellulitis from abscess; and procedural-guidance applications, including line placement, lumbar puncture, and abscess incision and drainage. We discuss POCUS applications with reviews of major pathologic findings, research gaps, the integration of POCUS into practice, and barriers to implementation.

### Renal ultrasound provides low utility in evaluating cardiac surgery associated acute kidney injury [^5cd883b2]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Results

A total of 90 patients (men, 64.4%) were included in this study. The patient age ranged from 21 to 88 with the mean age of 68 ± 13 years. 48 patients (53.3%) had a preoperative diagnosis of underlying kidney disease with 23 of those patients having stage IIIA CKD, 19 patients with stage IIIB CKD, and 6 patients with stage IV CKD.

A summary of demographic patient data is listed in Table 1.

Table 1
Demographics

Comparing preoperative creatinine to maximum creatinine during ICU hospital stay, the rise in creatinine ranged from 1 to 7× increase with mean increase of 2.43× ± 1.19. The indication for all 90 renal ultrasounds was acute renal injury consisting of elevated creatinine and/or oliguria following cardiac surgery.

A summary of pathologic and incidental sonographic findings is listed in Table 2.

Table 2
Renal ultrasound findings

Forty-eight patients had benign or incidental findings (simple cysts, non-obstructing calculi, vascular calcifications) on ultrasound. The most common abnormal sonographic findings was parenchymal or medical renal disease (31/90; 34.4%) as indicated by increased echogenicity or cortical thinning. Mild hydronephrosis was found in 1 patient without CKD (1.1%) who exhibited grade 1 right-sided hydronephrosis. 10 patients had poor visualization on their ultrasound due to body habitus and poor cooperation. No patients were diagnosed with renal artery stenosis or obstructive calculi on ultrasound.

Clinical decisions were made by ICU attendings based on creatinine trends, volume status, and urinary output. Initial supportive management of the postoperative patients was unchanged throughout the ICU stay for 86 (95.5%) of the patients, which involved diuretics (30 patients; 31.1) and auto-diuresis (56 patients; 35.6%). Renal consultation was obtained in 40 (44.4%) of patients. Clinical management was altered in only 4 patients (4.4%), which included 3 patients (1 without CKD, 2 with CKD stage IIIA) that received a fluid bolus and 1 patient with CKD stage IIIB that received a fluid bolus and initiation of inotropic support. No vascular or urologic procedures resulted from the US findings.

### Do current scientific reports of hydronephrosis make the grade? [^8d530976]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

In December 2014, Nguyen et al. introduced the Upper Tract Dilation (UTD) classification scheme, hoping to unify multiple disciplines when describing ultrasound imaging of congenital hydronephrosis. We hypothesized that the academic community has been slow to adopt its use in publications.

Primary Aim

To evaluate which hydronephrosis grading systems were currently preferred in publications.

Study Design

A PubMed® search for hydronephrosis was performed, and abstracts between May 2017 and May 2019 were reviewed. The following data points were collected from the 197 manuscripts meeting inclusion criteria: journal, first and senior author specialty, country, type of article, primary pathology, and classification of hydronephrosis when present. Differences between use of classification system, and author specialty, manuscript type, and pathology were evaluated.

Results

First and/or senior author specialties were most commonly pediatric urology, urology, pediatric surgery, and pediatric nephrology. The manuscripts were comprised of retrospective studies (48.2%), prospective studies (25.4%), case reports (15.7%), review articles (9.1%), and systematic reviews (1.5%). The most common pathologies were hydronephrosis (36.5%) and ureteropelvic junction obstruction (21.3%). Over 20% of manuscripts did not categorize hydronephrosis at all. The UTD classification was used by 5.6%, while Society for Fetal Urology (SFU) grading was used by 37.1% and Anterior-Posterior Diameter (APD) measurements by 32.5%. The Summary Table presents grading system by manuscript type, specialty, and pathology.

Discussion

There is great variability in hydronephrosis grading. One potential weakness of our study is that sufficient time may not have passed for the UTD system to be adopted. Researchers may need more time to complete and publish their studies, or could be awaiting further validation of UTD utility. They could also be hesitant to change systems when it is unknown if one classification schema is superior to another, either in general or for specific diagnoses. Another weakness is that this study does not quantify what, if any, systems are used clinically. Some attempt to provide objective classification would help clarify the implications of the manuscript for research or clinical applications. Reviewers should ensure that where possible, adequate descriptions of hydronephrosis are included. Education outreach to other specialties may help increase objective grading in research.

Conclusions

The UTD system is not commonly utilized in the literature. SFU grading is applied most commonly, followed by APD measurements. Over one third of manuscripts used no classification system or descriptive terminology.
