## Question

Does ibuprofen cause bloating

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether ibuprofen causes bloating. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the regulatory status and whether bloating is listed as an adverse effect in FDA labeling. Then, I should verify the mechanistic plausibility via COX inhibition and its impact on the GI tract. Next, I will review clinical data on incidence and severity, and consider dose, duration, and patient risk factors. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, clinically oriented conclusion with management advice and caveats about confounders and alternatives.

> Let me first confirm the regulatory signal. Multiple FDA labels consistently list bloating as a common gastrointestinal adverse effect of oral ibuprofen, typically in the 1–10% range, which establishes a recognized association even if causality is not absolute in every case [^c97a07e2] [^cb52faf9] [^dd3b55af].

> Wait, let me verify the mechanism before I jump to conclusions. Ibuprofen inhibits COX-1 and COX-2, reducing protective prostaglandins in the gastric and intestinal mucosa, which can impair barrier function, alter motility, and increase gas retention or visceral sensitivity, providing a biologically plausible pathway to bloating and related dyspeptic symptoms [^15a2a694] [^e6b34561].

> I need to check the clinical magnitude next. Controlled trials and labeling summaries report gastrointestinal complaints, including bloating, in roughly 4–16% of patients on ibuprofen, with higher event rates at higher doses and with longer duration, and comparative data suggest ibuprofen's GI symptom burden is about half that of aspirin at comparable doses, though still clinically meaningful in susceptible patients [^9360abd9] [^1c05c0b9] [^5bd9d3ac].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about risk being uniform. I should confirm modifiers: higher daily doses, prolonged use, older age, prior peptic ulcer disease or GI bleeding, concomitant corticosteroids or anticoagulants, smoking, and alcohol all increase the risk of serious GI events and likely exacerbate dyspeptic symptoms including bloating; even short-term therapy is not risk-free, so duration and dose minimization matter [^f96a1e43] [^06789b6b] [^368a3d77].

> Let me consider special contexts. In patients with altered GI anatomy or motility, such as post-pneumonectomy esophageal distortion or cystic fibrosis, high-dose ibuprofen has been associated with severe upper GI injury, underscoring that structural or motility disorders can amplify NSAID-related mucosal injury and symptom expression, including bloating and pain [^402d3d79] [^c05edb54].

> I should double-check whether bloating is also described with NSAIDs more broadly, to avoid over-attributing to ibuprofen alone. NSAID class reviews and clinical guidelines consistently note dyspepsia, bloating, and related GI symptoms as common adverse effects, reinforcing that bloating is a class phenomenon with variable incidence across agents and patient populations [^e6b34561] [^43b778ff].

> But wait, what if the bloating is multifactorial or due to other medications or conditions? I need to ensure we keep confounders in mind: opioids, calcium channel blockers, anticholinergics, and some antidepressants can cause bloating or constipation, and functional GI disorders, IBS, gastroparesis, and dietary factors commonly produce bloating independent of NSAIDs; thus, temporal correlation with ibuprofen initiation or dose escalation strengthens the case for causality, but absence of correlation does not exclude it [^4bd96c18] [^023a3e3f] [^7c42dd28].

> Next, I should review practical management. For patients who develop bothersome bloating on ibuprofen, options include switching to acetaminophen when appropriate, using the lowest effective NSAID dose for the shortest duration, taking NSAIDs with food, and considering gastroprotection with a PPI or H2RA if NSAID therapy is necessary and risk is elevated; in higher-risk patients, COX-2 selective agents may reduce upper GI events, though they do not eliminate lower GI risks and require individualized cardiovascular risk assessment [^c3baf10b] [^e8128e4c] [^43b778ff] [^d6504a90].

> In summary, I should confirm the bottom line clearly. Yes, ibuprofen can cause bloating. It is a labeled, common gastrointestinal adverse effect with a plausible COX-mediated mechanism, reported in a minority of users, with risk modulated by dose, duration, and patient susceptibility; clinicians should anticipate this, counsel patients, and adjust therapy if bloating emerges or worsens, balancing analgesic benefit against GI tolerability and safety [^c97a07e2] [^15a2a694] [^9360abd9].

---

Ibuprofen can cause **bloating** as a common gastrointestinal side effect, with an incidence of about 1–10% in clinical use [^c97a07e2] [^cb52faf9]. Bloating is typically mild and transient, but may be more frequent with higher doses or prolonged use [^9360abd9]. Risk is higher in patients with **prior GI symptoms**, older adults, or those taking other GI-irritating medications [^e8128e4c]. If bloating occurs, consider lowering the dose, taking ibuprofen with food, or switching to acetaminophen or a COX-2 inhibitor; persistent or severe bloating warrants medical evaluation [^c3baf10b] [^e8128e4c].

---

## Mechanism of ibuprofen-induced bloating

Ibuprofen-induced bloating is primarily due to **COX-1 inhibition**, which reduces protective gastric prostaglandins and leads to:

- **Gastric irritation and dyspepsia**: causing gas retention and bloating [^15a2a694].
- **Delayed gastric emptying**: promoting gas accumulation and distension [^fef28938].
- **Increased intestinal permeability**: allowing gas and fluids to accumulate, worsening bloating [^15a2a694].

---

## Incidence and clinical evidence

Multiple FDA labels consistently list **bloating as a common GI adverse effect** of ibuprofen, with an incidence of approximately 1–10% [^c97a07e2] [^cb52faf9]. Clinical trials and postmarketing data corroborate this, noting bloating among frequent GI complaints with NSAID use [^9360abd9] [^5bd9d3ac].

---

## Factors influencing risk and severity

Several factors influence the **likelihood and severity** of ibuprofen-related bloating:

| **Factor** | **Influence on bloating risk** |
|-|-|
| Dose and duration | Higher doses and prolonged use increase risk [^9360abd9] [^f96a1e43] |
| Age | Older adults have higher risk due to reduced GI resilience [^e8128e4c] |
| Pre-existing GI conditions | History of ulcers, dyspepsia, or IBS increases susceptibility [^e8128e4c] [^79e94d56] |
| Concomitant medications | Corticosteroids, anticoagulants, and SSRIs elevate GI risk [^e8128e4c] [^72e30867] |
| Individual susceptibility | Genetic or physiological differences affect GI sensitivity [^notfound] |

---

## Clinical management and prevention

When patients report bloating with ibuprofen, clinicians may:

- **Lower the dose or switch to acetaminophen**: reduces GI irritation [^c3baf10b].
- **Take with food or milk**: mitigates gastric irritation [^f7e15ae5].
- **Use gastroprotective agents**: PPIs or H2 blockers can reduce GI symptoms [^43b778ff].
- **Consider COX-2 inhibitors**: lower GI risk but require cardiovascular risk assessment [^d6504a90].

Persistent or severe bloating should prompt evaluation for **underlying GI pathology** (e.g. peptic ulcer, gastroparesis, IBD) [^0ed4201f].

---

## Comparison with other NSAIDs

Ibuprofen generally has a **lower GI risk profile** than some NSAIDs (e.g. indomethacin, piroxicam), but bloating remains a common class effect [^5bd9d3ac] [^fbc2ff15]. COX-2 inhibitors (e.g. celecoxib) cause less GI irritation but carry cardiovascular risks and do not eliminate bloating entirely [^d13cd72c] [^d6504a90].

---

## Patient counseling and education

Patients should be counseled to:

- **Recognize early symptoms**: bloating, dyspepsia, or abdominal discomfort [^729e65ff].
- **Use the lowest effective dose**: for the shortest duration [^c3baf10b].
- **Avoid alcohol and smoking**: both increase GI risk [^e8128e4c].
- **Seek medical attention**: for persistent or severe symptoms [^0ed4201f].

---

Ibuprofen commonly causes **bloating** through COX-1–mediated GI effects, with risk modulated by dose, duration, and patient factors. Management includes dose reduction, food coadministration, gastroprotection, or switching to alternatives, and persistent symptoms warrant further evaluation [^c97a07e2] [^c3baf10b].

Introduction

Chronic Abdominal Pain (CAP) is a condition that affects millions of patients annually. Generally, it is a challenging diagnosis to manage with a range of heterogeneous etiologies. Current diagnostic criteria define CAP as constant or recurrent pain that lasts for at least 3 months. It is estimated that approximately 1–2% of the adult population is affected by CAP, with greater frequency of occurrence in females compared to males. The etiology of CAP is elusive, with high concordance with previous abdominal surgery, namely herniorrhaphy, adhesiolysis and cholecystectomy. Other identifiable components of CAP include visceral pain (chronic pancreatitis, mesenteric angina, etc), somatic pain, psychogenic pain and functional pain. Also associated can be symptoms of nausea, anorexia, bloating and early satiety. Treatment typically centers around pharmacotherapy with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), opioids, proton pump inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants most commonly used. In some cases, medications can potentiate exacerbation of symptoms, as in the development of peptic ulcer disease secondary to NSAID overuse or constipation secondary to opioid use. The pathophysiology of CAP can be multifactorial thus requiring a broad spectrum of treatment modalities.

PMDD is a mood disorder related to the menstrual cycle. PMDD significantly interferes with work or school, or with usual social activities and relationships with others. Symptoms include markedly depressed mood, anxiety or tension, mood swings, and persistent anger or irritability. Other features include decreased interest in usual activities, difficulty concentrating, lack of energy, change in appetite or sleep, and feeling out of control. Physical symptoms associated with PMDD may include breast tenderness, headache, joint and muscle pain, bloating and weight gain. These symptoms occur regularly before menstruation starts and go away within a few days following the start of the period. Diagnosis of PMDD should be made by healthcare providers.

Gastrointestinal Effects – Risk of Ulceration, Bleeding, and Perforation

NSAIDs, including ibuprofen, can cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs. Only one in five patients, who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy, is symptomatic. Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occur in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3 to 6 months, and in about 2 to 4% of patients treated for one year. These trends continue with longer duration of use, increasing the likelihood of developing a serious GI event at some time during the course of therapy. However, even short-term therapy is not without risk.

NSAIDs should be prescribed with extreme caution in those with a prior history of ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or gastrointestinal bleeding who use NSAIDs have a greater than 10-fold risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients with neither of these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk for GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include concomitant use of oral corticosteroids or anticoagulants, longer duration of NSAID therapy, smoking, use of alcohol, older age, and poor general health status. Most spontaneous reports of fatal GI events are in elderly or debilitated patients and therefore, special care should be taken in treating this population.

To minimize the potential risk for an adverse GI event in patients treated with an NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest possible duration. Patients and physicians should remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy and promptly initiate additional evaluation and treatment if a serious GI adverse event is suspected. This should include discontinuation of the NSAID until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out. For high risk patients, alternate therapies that do not involve NSAIDs should be considered.

### Drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol (Gianvi) [^c1e5a965]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

NSAIDs (ibuprofen [Motrin, Advil], naprosyn [Aleve and others] when taken long-term and daily for treatment of arthritis or other problems)
Potassium-sparing diuretics (spironolactone and others)
Potassium supplementation
ACE inhibitors (Capoten, Vasotec, Zestril and others)
Angiotensin-II receptor antagonists (Cozaar, Diovan, Avapro and others)
Heparin
Aldosterone antagonists

Gianvi is an oral contraceptive, also known as a "birth control pill" or "the Pill". Oral contraceptives are taken to prevent pregnancy, and, when taken correctly without missing any pills, have a failure rate of approximately 1% per year (1 pregnancy per 100 women per year of use). The typical failure rate in pill users is approximately 5% per year (5 pregnancies per 100 women per year of use) when women who miss pills are included. Forgetting to take pills considerably increases the chances of pregnancy.

Gianvi may also be taken to treat premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) if you choose to use the Pill for birth control. Unless you have already decided to use the Pill for birth control, you should not start Gianvi to treat your PMDD because there are other medical therapies for PMDD that do not have the same risks as the Pill. PMDD is a mood disorder related to the menstrual cycle. PMDD significantly interferes with work or school, or with usual social activities and relationships with others. Symptoms include markedly depressed mood, anxiety or tension, mood swings, and persistent anger or irritability.

### Quantifying the intensity of adverse events with ibuprofen and oxycodone: an observational cohort study [^d3eb7970]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2022). High credibility.

Currently recommended first-line therapy for moderate pain in children is to combine acetaminophen with ibuprofen; if this is inadequate, oral opioids, including oxycodone, can be added. Still, up to 41% of trainees and 25% of practitioners indicate that they consider opioids a top choice for moderate pain treatment. Considering both this and the fact that ibuprofen and opioids are reported as similarly efficacious for childhood fracture pain management, AE profiles are an important consideration when making clinical prescribing decisions.

We stratified common AEs by intensity, which may help clinicians and families make more informed decisions regarding medication choice, as AEs are a critical consideration in early stopping of use of analgesics. For example, while often dismissed as a 'trivial side effect', constipation can result in significant morbidity, with an adverse effect on patient quality of life, and association with self-directed decrease in dose, leading to undertreatment of pain. Intensity comparisons of AEs may help clinicians better understand the recovery experience in children with pain. Importantly, abdominal pain and constipation were experienced at higher intensity in children taking oxycodone, even though the proportion of children experiencing abdominal pain was not different between groups. Further, constipation is a well-described side effect of oxycodone in children; our data support previously published studies that promote coprescription of stool softeners or laxatives to prevent this common and distressing AE. Notably, vomiting was ranked higher in intensity than all other AEs regardless of medication used; clinicians may consider this when making prescribing decisions, especially for those with a propensity towards gastrointestinal upset.

However, even short-term therapy is not without risk. NSAIDs should be prescribed with extreme caution in those with a prior history of ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. Patients with a prior history or peptic ulcer disease and/or gastrointestinal bleeding who use NSAIDs have a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients treated with neither of these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk of GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include concomitant use of oral corticosteroids or anticoagulants, longer duration of NSAID therapy, smoking, use of alcohol, older age, and poor general health status. Most spontaneous reports of fatal GI events are in elderly or debilitated patients and therefore, special care should be taken in treating this population.

### Chronic abdominal discomfort syndrome (CADS): a narrative review of treatment strategies [^9d060d04]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are commonly used analgesic medications appreciated for their antipyretic and anti-inflammatory properties. The primary mechanism of action of NSAIDs is inhibition of the cyclooxygenase enzyme, which functions to convert arachidonic acid into substances such as prostaglandins that play a role in nociception. There are two separate types of cyclooxygenases: COX–1 and COX–2, both of which are important in maintaining gastrointestinal mucosa, kidney function and platelet aggregation. Subsequently, inhibition of COX–1 and COX–2 can lead to detrimental effects manifesting as gastric ulcers, worsening kidney function and difficulty with blood clotting. At present, the most prescribed NSAIDs on market are ibuprofen, aspirin and naproxen, the last of which is a selective COX–2 NSAID that primarily decreases inflammation while minimizing damage to gastric mucosa. It is not recommended that patients be treated with NSAIDs long term for pain management, as approximately one-third of patients consuming NSAIDs will develop symptoms such as dyspepsia and gastroesophageal reflux disease. The most common and potentially dangerous complication of NSAID usage is peptic ulcer development, which can often occur with no prior warning symptoms. Compared to non-users, the risk of complications secondary to gastroduodenal peptic ulcers are 5 times more frequent among those consuming NSAIDs long term. Considering the neuropathic etiology of CADS, the question of whether NSAIDs in general have any benefit for use in chronic neuropathic pain. In a Cochrane review published in 2015, two studies involving 251 participants with neuropathic etiology of pain were administered NSAIDs and monitored for pain score improvement. Results produced no evidence to support or refute the use of oral NSAIDs to treat neuropathic conditions, with only third tear evidence (very low quality) supporting usage. Given increased risk versus benefit for the use of NSAIDs and treatment of general chronic pain, it is not advised that NSAIDs be prescribed for treatment of suspected CADS.

Information for Patients:

Patients should be informed of the following information before initiating therapy with an NSAID and periodically during the course of ongoing therapy. Patients should also be encouraged to read the NSAID Medication Guide that accompanies each prescription dispensed.

CARDIOVASCULAR THROMBOTIC EVENTS: Advise patients to be alert for the symptoms of cardiovascular thrombotic events, including chest pain, shortness of breath, weakness, or slurring of speech, and to report any of these symptoms to their healthcare provider immediately (see WARNINGS).
Ibuprofen, like other NSAIDs, can cause GI discomfort and, rarely, serious GI side effects, such as ulcers and bleeding, which may result in hospitalization or even death. Although serious GI tract ulcerations and bleeding can occur without warning symptoms, patients should be alert for signs and symptoms of ulcerations and bleeding, and should ask for medical advice when observing any indicative sign or symptoms including epigastric pain, dyspepsia, melena, and hematemesis. Patients should be apprised of the importance of this follow-up (see WARNINGS, Gastrointestinal Effects-Risk of Ulceration, Bleeding, and Perforation).
Serious Skin Reactions, including DRESS

Advise patients to stop taking ibuprofen oral suspension immediately if they develop any type of rash or fever and to contact their healthcare provider as soon as possible [see Warnings].
Heart Failure And Edema: Advise patients to be alert for the symptoms of congestive heart failure including shortness of breath, unexplained weight gain, or edema and to contact their healthcare provider if such symptoms occur (see WARNINGS).
Patients should be informed of the warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity (e.g., nausea, fatigue, lethargy, pruritis, jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness, and "flu-like" symptoms). If these occur, patients should be instructed to stop therapy and seek immediate medical therapy.
Patients should be informed of the signs of an anaphylactoid reaction (e.g., difficulty breathing, swelling of the face or throat). If these occur, patients should be instructed to seek immediate emergency help (see WARNINGS).
Fetal Toxicity Inform pregnant women to avoid use of ibuprofen oral suspension and other NSAIDs starting at 30 weeks gestation because of the risk of the premature closing of the fetal ductus arteriosus. If treatment with ibuprofen oral suspension is needed for a pregnant woman between about 20 to 30 weeks gestation, advise her that she may need to be monitored for oligohydramnios, if treatment continues for longer than 48 hours [see WARNINGS; Fetal Toxicity, PRECAUTIONS; Pregnancy].

### Reduction in pain: is it worth the gain? The effect of opioids on the GI tract [^2d2c8a85]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2018). Low credibility.

The use of opioid medications for acute and chronic pain has increased significantly in the past 20 years in the United States. Given the high density of opioid receptors in the gastrointestinal tract, side effects are common in these patients including constipation, dysphagia, bloating, nausea, and vomiting. These side effects, which are experienced by most patients who take opioids, can lead to significant impairment in quality of life. Unlike other side effects from opioids, gastrointestinal side effects do not diminish with continued use, often leading patients to reduce or discontinue their opioid treatment to relieve these side effects. Therefore, physicians must be aware and anticipate potential side effects in patients receiving opioids to ensure appropriate pain management.

Wilderness Medical Society acute pain — nonopioid analgesia: Combining acetaminophen with a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) should be used as the first-line medication treatment of acute pain in the wilderness, unless there is a specific patient allergy or other contraindication (Recommendation grade: 1A). As the basis of medical therapy for acute injury, these medications should be regularly dosed throughout the acute injury period. NSAIDs do have adverse effects, including renal injury (especially in dehydrated patients) and inhibition of platelet function that can increase bleeding; giving NSAIDs with food can alleviate gastrointestinal symptoms, and if significant abdominal pain develops, the medication should be stopped. Short-term use for up to 10 days of over-the-counter NSAIDs with standard dosing has been shown to be extremely safe and well tolerated, and an ibuprofen dose of 1200 mg/d or less or naproxen at 660 mg/d or less has no greater risk than placebo. For acetaminophen, prescription-dose acetaminophen up to 4 g/d in an adult is still appropriate for short-term use; it is considered safe in intoxicated patients, but care should be taken in chronic alcoholics and patients with hepatic dysfunction.

### Ibuprofen and famotidine [^e8128e4c]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.2	Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation

NSAIDs, including ibuprofen, cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDS. Only one in five patients who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy is symptomatic. Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occurred in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3–6 months, and in about 2%-4% of patients treated for one year. However, even short-term NSAID therapy is not without risk.

Risk Factors for GI Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation

Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding who used NSAIDs had a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients without these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk of GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include longer duration of NSAID therapy; concomitant use of oral corticosteroids, aspirin, anticoagulants, or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs); smoking; use of alcohol; older age; and poor general health status. Most postmarketing reports of fatal GI events occurred in elderly or debilitated patients. Additionally, patients with advanced liver disease and/or coagulopathy are at increased risk for GI bleeding. NSAIDs should be given with care to patients with a history of inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease) as their condition may be exacerbated.

Strategies to Minimize the GI Risks in NSAID-treated patients:

Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest possible duration.
Avoid administration of more than one NSAID at a time.
Avoid use in patients at higher risk unless benefits are expected to outweigh the increased risk of bleeding. For such patients, as well as those with active GI bleeding, consider alternate therapies other than NSAIDs.
Remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy.
If a serious GI adverse event is suspected, promptly initiate evaluation and treatment, and discontinue ibuprofen and famotidine tablet until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out.
In the setting of concomitant use of low-dose aspirin for cardiac prophylaxis, monitor patients more closely for evidence of GI bleeding [see Drug Interactions (7)].

Protective Action Against Gastric Mucosal Damage

Gastrointestinal complications are well-recognized side effects of NSAIDs. The upper gastrointestinal side effects include troublesome symptoms with or without mucosal injury, asymptomatic mucosal lesions, and serious complications, even death. It has been shown that about 30–50% of NSAIDs users have endoscopic lesions (erosions, subepithelial hemorrhages, ulcerations) mainly located in the gastric antrum, and often without clinical manifestations. On the contrary, up to 40% of NSAIDs users have symptoms, the most frequent being gastroesophageal reflux disease and dyspepsia. However, although the use of NSAIDs has been associated with a 3- to 5-fold increase in the risk of upper gastrointestinal complications, the risk varies between individual NSAIDs. Within the European Community's Seventh Framework Programme, the Safety Of non-Steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) [SOS] project, a systematic review and meta-analysis of 28 observational studies provided summary relative risks (RR) of upper gastrointestinal complications associated with NSAIDs. Pooled RR ranged from 1.43 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.65–3.15) for aceclofenac to 18.45 (95% CI 10.99–30.97) for azapropazone, with RR less than 2 for ibuprofen (1.84, 95% CI 1.54–2.20). Moreover, various studies including meta-analyses have shown that the nature and frequency of gastrointestinal adverse effects due to ibuprofen intake are similar to those observed with the use of paracetamol, naproxen or placebo.

Dyspeptic symptoms are common in GERD patients, especially those with frequent reflux related symptoms. In these patients, epigastric pain, belching, bloating, and early satiety were found to improve on PPI therapy, conversely from nausea and vomiting, which did not benefit from acid suppression.

In addition to suppressing acid secretion, PPIs can also inhibit gastric motility and delay emptying rate and, as a consequence, dyspeptic symptoms may actually be worsened by PPI therapy or, alternatively, new symptoms (especially postprandial fullness) may arise during treatment. If this is the case, patients could be switched to the H 2 RAs, ranitidine or nizatidine, which, in addition to their antisecretory activity, display a cholinergic-like activity and have been shown to accelerate gastric emptying. On the other hand, a Cochrane meta-analysis showed that H 2 RAs are better than placebo in achieving symptom relief in patients with FD.

PPIs for NSAID-associated symptoms and lesions

Summary of the current evidence

Standard dose PPIs are indicated for patients taking non-selective NSAIDs at risk for upper GI complications (bleeding and perforation) and for those given selective cyclooxygenase (COX-2) inhibitors having had an episode of previous GI bleeding. In both non-selective and COX-2 selective NSAID users, PPI therapy reduces upper GI symptoms, in particular dyspepsia. However, NSAID-induced adverse events in the lower GI tract are not prevented by PPIs.

NSAIDs are amongst the most widely used classes of drugs. Although they are very effective medications, their use is associated with a broad spectrum of adverse effects in the liver, kidney, cardiovascular (CV) system, skin, and gut. GI adverse effects are the most common and include a wide clinical spectrum ranging from dyspepsia, heartburn, and abdominal discomfort to more serious events such as PU with life-threatening complications, including bleeding and perforation.

### Double-blind randomized trials of single-tablet ibuprofen / high-dose famotidine vs. ibuprofen alone for reduction of gastric and duodenal ulcers [^702743b4]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are widely used as analgesics. Ibuprofen is the most commonly used non-aspirin NSAID, with about one quarter of the US population aged 17 years or older reporting ibuprofen intake in the past month. The main factor that limits NSAID use is the development of upper gastrointestinal (GI) adverse effects including ulcers, complications such as bleeding, and dyspepsia. Strategies recommended to decrease GI injury in NSAID users include co-therapy with misoprostol or proton-pump inhibitors and/or use of COX-2 selective inhibitors.

Histamine 2 -receptor antagonists (H2RAs) have not been recommended for preventive therapy in NSAID users because, when given in standard doses, they significantly decrease duodenal but not gastric ulcers. However, a Cochrane systematic review of placebo-controlled randomized trials ≥ 3 months identified one study showing a significant benefit of double-dose H2RAs in reducing both gastric ulcers (relative risk (RR) = 0.42, 95% confidence interval, 0.18–0.97) and duodenal ulcers (RR = 0.19, 0.04–0.85). The RRs for proton-pump inhibitor vs. placebo co-therapy in the meta-analysis were 0.40 (0.32–0.51) for gastric ulcers and 0.19 (0.09–0.37) for duodenal ulcers.

Although many national and international groups recommend protective therapy in NSAID users at increased risk of GI events, most such patients are not prescribed protective therapy. In addition, patients may not take their protective co-therapy along with their NSAID, especially if they are not experiencing any symptoms, and decreased adherence is associated with a significantly increased risk of developing upper GI ulcers or bleeding. For example, van Soest et al. reported that the risk of an upper GI clinical event (bleeding, perforation, or symptomatic ulcer) in NSAID users at increased GI risk rose 16% for every 10% decrease in the proportion of time a proton-pump inhibitor or H2RA was prescribed. Mechanisms that ensure adherence to protective therapy, such as the combination of an NSAID and a protective agent in one pill, theoretically should decrease the GI risk associated with the NSAID therapy.

Increasing life expectancy in developed countries has led to a growing prevalence of arthritic disorders, which has been accompanied by increasing prescriptions for nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). These are the most widely used agents for musculoskeletal and arthritic conditions. Although NSAIDs are effective, their use is associated with a broad spectrum of adverse reactions in the liver, kidney, cardiovascular system, skin, and gut. Gastrointestinal (GI) side effects are the most common. The dilemma for the physician prescribing NSAIDs is, therefore, to maintain the antiinflammatory and analgesic benefits, while reducing or preventing GI side effects. The challenge is to develop safer NSAIDs by shifting from a focus on GI toxicity to the increasingly more appreciated cardiovascular toxicity.

### An integrated safety analysis of intravenous ibuprofen (caldolor (®)) in adults [^bae14435]. Journal of Pain Research (2015). Low credibility.

Narcotics which bind to opioid receptors are prescribed for the treatment of both acute and chronic pain. The common side effects associated with opioid administration are well known and include constipation, nausea, vomiting, sedation, and dizziness. Constipation has been noted to occur with as little as one dose of morphine and may effect up to 95% of patients receiving opioid therapy. Constipation is a potentially serious complication which can result in decreased patient compliance and therefore inferior pain control, hemorrhoid formation, rectal pain, bowel rupture, and potentially death. Less common adverse effects include respiratory depression, reduced gastric motility, bladder dysfunction (eg, urinary retention), immunological depression (both adaptive and innate), hormonal dysfunction (opioid endocrinopathy), sleep disturbances, and CV complications (eg, vasodilation, hypotension, bradycardia). Over time, tolerance, hyperalgesia (increased pain sensitivity), and addiction or physical dependence can develop. It is generally recommended that opioids be used in conjunction with other analgesic approaches (pharmaceutical and otherwise) and for the shortest time possible. Thus, limiting use of opioid analgesics by any means can increase overall patient safety in the hospital setting. Multiple meta-analyses clearly demonstrate that members of the NSAID drug class confer an opioid sparing effect which is a safety benefit when opioid-associated AEs and the potential for addiction are considered. The extent of the reduction in narcotic use by any given NSAID would be dependent on multiple factors including, but not limited to, the extent of preexisting central sensitization (duration of pain) and the pain level experienced by the patient – even under sedation. Thus, when assessing the extent of morphine sparing reported by a clinical trial, the minimum baseline pain score (eg, VAS) required for eligibility must be taken into account. Due to the nature of the approved indications for IV ibuprofen, clinical studies enroll subjects with mild to moderate pain and above (ie, VAS ≥ 30 mm, 100 mm scale). Alternatively, studies of IV diclofenac or ketorolac focus on moderate to severe pain and exclusively enroll subjects with a baseline VAS of ≥ 50 mm. Thus, the extent of morphine sparing cannot be compared between the two clinical programs. Alternatively, the conclusion which can be made is that despite the inclusion of a portion of patients with lower baseline pain scores (who may never require narcotics), the use of IV ibuprofen prior to and during surgery is consistently associated with reductions in narcotic use across studies – up to a 74% reduction when integrated into multimodal pain management regimens (P < 0.001). This is a substantial reduction when considered as an absolute value and even more so when the potential dilution of the morphine-sparing effect by inclusion of patients with lower baseline pain is considered.

### Fatality after deliberate ingestion of sustained-release ibuprofen: a case report [^c54baab8]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Management of patients presenting following deliberate self-poisoning with ibuprofen consists of gut decontamination with activated charcoal, if they present within one hour of a potentially toxic overdose, and generalised supportive care. As already discussed, multidose activated charcoal may be appropriate in patients who have ingested a potentially toxic amount of a sustained-release preparation. Other more severe features of ibuprofen toxicity should be managed appropriately. Ibuprofen-induced seizures that are nonself-limiting should initially be managed with intravenous diazepam (0.1–0.2 mg/kg). Significant metabolic acidosis (pH < 7.0) that does not respond to adequate intravenous fluid resuscitation, and maintenance of the blood pressure, with intropic support if appropriate, should be corrected with intravenous 50–100 mL boluses of 8.4% sodium bicarbonate. For resistant metabolic acidosis that is not responding, then haemofiltration with a nonlactate bicarbonate buffer may be beneficial. Although ibuprofen has a relatively low volume of distribution (0.1 l/kg), its high protein binding to albumin (99%) limits removal by extracorporeal treatments such as haemodialysis or haemofiltration.

Previous studies have demonstrated no accumulation of ibuprofen in patients with renal impairment and, in functionally anephric patients undergoing renal replacement therapy with haemodialysis, no accumulation of ibuprofen was seen and there was no detectable ibuprofen in the dialysate, indicating that the ibuprofen was eliminated through metabolism. This provides further support that extracorporeal treatments will probably not be beneficial in increasing the clearance of ibuprofen in overdose, and there have been no previous reported cases of their attempted use in patients with ibuprofen toxicity. There have been no published studies on the routine prophylactic use of H 2 histamine receptor antagonists or proton pump inhibitors in trying to reduce the risk of ibuprofen or other NSAID-related gastrointestinal toxicity. Our current practice in patients with significant epigastric pain/tenderness after ibuprofen poisoning is to treat them with 1 week of a proton pump inhibitor such as lansoprazole 30 mg once daily.

Gastrointestinal Effects - Risk of Ulceration, Bleeding, and Perforation

NSAIDs, including IBU tablets, can cause serious gastrointestinal(GI) adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs. Only one in five patients, who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy, is symptomatic. Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occur in approximately 1% of patientstreated for 3–6 months, and in about 2–4% of patients treated for oneyear. These trends continue with longer duration of use, increasing the likelihood of developing a serious GI event at some time during the course of therapy. However, even short-term therapy is not without risk. NSAIDs should be prescribed with extreme caution in thosewith a prior history of ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or gastrointestinal bleeding who use NSAIDs have a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients treatedwith neither of these risk factors. Other factors that increase the riskof GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include concomitant use of oral corticosteroids or anticoagulants, longer duration of NSAID therapy, smoking, use of alcohol, older age, and poor general health status. Most spontaneous reports of fatal GI events are in elderly or debilitated patients and therefore, special care should be taken in treating this population. To minimize the potential risk for an adverse GI event in patients treated with an NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest possible duration. Patients and physicians should remain alert for signs and symptoms of GIulcerations and bleeding during NSAID therapy and promptly initiate additional evaluation and treatment if a serious GI event is suspected. This should include discontinuation of the NSAID until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out. For high-risk patients, alternate therapies that do not involve NSAIDs should be considered.

Diagnostic testing and imaging for bloating and distention — testing is selective and guided by alarm features and examination. "Symptoms of bloating and distention do not routinely require laboratory testing or obtaining radiologic imaging or endoscopy unless the history discloses concerning symptoms, an abdominal physical examination, or alarm features". The authors "advise ordering tests with worsening dyspepsia or abdominal pain, particularly of recent onset; vomiting; GI bleeding; unintentional weight loss > 10% of body weight; chronic diarrhea; or a family history of GI malignancy, CD, or inflammatory bowel disease". If visible abdominal distension is present, "an abdominal examination will help to evaluate for an abdominal mass", and with abnormal findings, "Any abnormalities would lead to a computed tomography scan or ultrasound of the abdomen to evaluate for ascites or a mass or to identify increased bowel gas due to ileus, obstruction, or pseudo-obstruction". The text adds, "Bloating and abdominal fullness are often presenting symptoms in patients with ovarian cancer; the highest risk is in women 50 years or older".

Relationship of AEs with study medication

Overall, 16% of AEs were considered possibly related to the study medication (85/520). By treatment group, this was 22% for the FDC, 18% for APAP, 17% for IBP, and 8% for placebo (Table 6). Related AEs were largely considered either mild or moderate (Table 6), with only six considered severe, three of which were in the placebo group. The proportion of patients experiencing AEs that were considered possibly related to the study medication was comparable between the FDC and APAP groups (10%) and lowest in the IBP and placebo groups (5%–6%). No AEs were considered definitely related to the study medication.

Rescue medication

All pooled studies examined the use of rescue medication following surgery as a secondary efficacy end point. The percentage of patients requiring rescue medication was pooled and assessed. The percentage of subjects that required at least one dose of rescue medication was highest in the placebo group (70%) and lowest in the FDC group (34%). In the active comparator groups, over 39% (IBP) and 50% (APAP) of subjects required at least one dose of rescue medication. The difference between the FDC group with APAP and placebo was statistically significant, but there was no significant difference between the FDC and IBP (FDC vs APAP P < 0.001; IBP P = 0.348; Placebo P < 0.001).

Long-term exposure safety data

An exploratory long-term exposure study (AFT-MX-4) recruited a total of 33 subjects (aged 45–73 years old), of whom 29 continued through to the open-label phase and 24 completed the full 52-week long-term exposure trial (Table 7). During the 52-week treatment period, 42 AEs were reported among the 33 subjects. Seven of these AEs occurred during the double-blind phase, while 35 occurred during the open-label phase. The majority of AEs in the 48-week open-label phase were GI disturbances (75%), such as hyperchlorhydria, gastritis, dyspepsia, vomiting, and abdominal discomfort. Four SAEs were reported in two patients during the open-label phase (lower limb fracture, palpitations, vertigo, and hypoglycemia), with each event considered unrelated to the study medication. No significant changes associated with the study medication were observed in hematology or biochemistry parameters between screening and week 52.

Information for Patients

Patients should be informed of the following information before initiating therapy with an NSAID and periodically during the course of ongoing therapy. Patients should also be encouraged to read the NSAID Medication Guide that accompanies each prescription dispensed.

Ibuprofen tablets like other NSAIDs, may cause serious CV side effects, such as MI or stroke, which may result in hospitalization and even death. Although serious CV events can occur without warning symptoms, patients should be alert for the signs and symptoms of chest pain, shortness of breath, weakness, slurring of speech, and should ask for medical advice when observing any indicative sign or symptoms. Patients should be apprised of the importance of this follow-up (see WARNINGS, Cardiovascular Effects).
Ibuprofen tablets, like other NSAIDs, can cause GI discomfort and, rarely, serious GI side effects, such as ulcers and bleeding, which may result in hospitalization and even death. Although serious GI tract ulcerations and bleeding can occur without warning symptoms, patients should be alert for the signs and symptoms of ulcerations and bleeding, and should ask for medical advice when observing any indicative signs or symptoms including epigastric pain, dyspepsia, melena, and hematemesis. Patients should be apprised of the importance of this follow-up (see WARNINGS, Gastrointestinal Effects- Risk of Ulceration, Bleeding and Perforation).
Ibuprofen tablets, like other NSAIDs, can cause serious skin side effects such as exfoliative dermatitis, SJS and TEN, which may result in hospitalization and even death. Although serious skin reactions may occur without warning, patients should be alert for the signs and symptoms of skin rash and blisters, fever, or other signs hypersensitivity such as itching, and should ask for medical advice when observing any indicative sign or symptoms. Patients should be advised to stop the drug immediately if they develop any type of rash and contact their physicians as soon as possible.
Patients should promptly report signs or symptoms of unexplained weight gain or edema to their physicians.
Patients should be informed of the warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity (e.g., nausea, fatigue, lethargy, pruritus, jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness and "flu-like" symptoms). If these occur, patients should be instructed to stop therapy and seek immediate medical therapy.
Patients should be informed of the signs of an anaphylactoid reaction (e.g. difficulty breathing, swelling of the face or throat). If these occur, patients should be instructed to seek immediate emergency help (see WARNINGS).
In late pregnancy, as with other NSAIDs, ibuprofen tablets should be avoided because it may cause premature closure of the ductus arteriosus.

### Fatality after deliberate ingestion of sustained-release ibuprofen: a case report [^aa2b9ea3]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Introduction

Ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug available over the counter and on prescription for the management of pain and inflammation. Severe toxicity is rare following deliberate self-poisoning with ibuprofen, and patients are usually either asymptomatic or develop only mild gastrointestinal toxicity. Although there have been nine other reported fatalities, co-existent factors have probably contributed to all of these deaths. We report here a fatality from isolated toxicity following self-poisoning with sustained-release ibuprofen.

Case Report

A 26-year-old female presented after deliberate ingestion of up to 105 g sustained-release ibuprofen, with a reduced level of consciousness, severe metabolic acidosis and haemodynamic compromise. Despite intensive supportive management, gut decontamination with multidose activated charcoal and correction of the metabolic acidosis with sodium bicarbonate and haemofiltration, the patient did not survive. The ibuprofen concentration ante mortem on presentation in peripheral blood was 760 mg/l and the concentrations post mortem were 518 mg/l in peripheral blood, 74 mg/kg in liver extract and 116 mg/l in the gastric contents.

Discussion

Most patients with ibuprofen poisoning are either asymptomatic or have mild gastrointestinal symptoms; severe poisoning with ibuprofen is rare. We report the first death related to isolated sustained-release ibuprofen poisoning.

GI risks of NSAIDs

Statement 4: NSAID use is associated with increased risk of adverse events throughout the entire GI tract; this is associated with substantial mortality. Level of Agreement: Strong Agreement (vote statement: a, 75.0%; b, 21.9%; c, 3.1%). Level of Evidence: A (vote grade: A, 87.5%; B, 12.5%).

The GI adverse effects of NSAIDs have been well documented in several studies, meta-analyses, and Cochrane reviews. The majority of these studies have reported adverse events in the upper GI tract. The meta-analysis by Ofman et al. which reviewed severe upper GI complications in almost 800,000 patients taking oral NSAIDs for at least 4 days, showed an OR of 5.36 (95% CI, 1.79–16.1) from 16 RCTs (versus placebo), RR of 2.7 (95% CI, 2.1–3.5) from 9 cohort studies, and OR of 3.0 (95% CI, 2.5–3.7) from 23 case control studies for severe upper GI complications, which included perforations, clinically relevant ulcers, and bleeding.

Similarly, low-dose (≤ 325 mg daily) aspirin is associated with major upper GI bleeding: the RR was 2.1 (95% CI, 1.6–2.7) in the meta-analysis by McQuaid and Laine and 2.6 (95% CI, 2.2–2.9) in the large Danish cohort study, carried out by Sørensen et al. Lanas et al. recently reported an OR of 1.55 (95% CI, 1.27–1.90) and found that PPI use reduced the risk of major GI bleeding (OR, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.21–0.57).

A predictable and consistent GI blood loss has been shown in healthy volunteers taking ibuprofen (800 mg t.i.d.). Bleeding was observed in 27/31 subjects (87%) and averaged 4.5 to 5.0 mL/day (SD, 12; range, 0–65 mL/day) with an onset of 3 to 5 days after starting the drug.

### Mast cell deposition and activation may be a new explanation for epiploic appendagitis [^1c98c19e]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 40-year-old Caucasian woman with a history of migraines, gastro-oesophageal reflux, nausea, IBS–diarrhoea and many other idiopathic syndromes suffered with constant abdominal pain with episodic attacks of severe abdominal pain over the past year. The pain had peaks of labour-like contractions lasting 5 min. This pain was sharp and migratory but most often was located in the right lower quadrant. It was worse with pressure, palpation and movement. Over the same time period, she had worsening headaches, fatigue and cognitive dysfunction. This pain was clearly differentiated by the patient from her 8-year history of IBS which was characterised by postprandial crampy pain, bloating, foul gas and diarrhoea which responded to periodic 2-week courses of the antibiotic rifaximin. Over the course of the year, rifaximin was prescribed but did not help this pain.

The patient presented for evaluation in the GI clinic after 4 days of extremely severe, sharp right lower abdominal pain that awoke her from sleep and was associated with a 100 o F temperature. The right lower quadrant was markedly tender with guarding. The white blood count was normal. The CT was abnormal (figure 1). Despite administration of acetaminophen and ibuprofen, the pain worsened and after 7 days of unremitting pain, laparoscopic surgery was performed. Gross findings included an enlarged area of fat near the normal appendix that had a small amount of superficial focal fat necrosis. After surgical resection of the appendage, the right lower pain immediately abated and she was discharged. Standard H&E stain showed adipose tissue with patchy areas of fat necrosis with repair. The appendectomy specimen was normal.

Gastrointestinal (GI) Effects - Risk of GI Ulceration, Bleeding and Perforation

NSAIDs, including VICOPROFEN, can cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs. Only one in five patients who develops a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy, is symptomatic. Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occur in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3–6 months, and in about 2–4% of patients treated for one year. These trends continue with longer duration of use, increasing the likelihood of developing a serious GI event at some time during the course of therapy. However, even short-term therapy is not without risk.

NSAIDs should be prescribed with extreme caution in those with a prior history of ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or gastrointestinal bleeding who use NSAIDs have a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients with neither of these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk for GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include concomitant use of oral corticosteroids or anticoagulants, longer duration of NSAID therapy, smoking, use of alcohol, older age, and poor general health status. Most spontaneous reports of fatal GI events are in elderly or debilitated patients and therefore, special care should be taken in treating this population.

To minimize the potential risk for an adverse GI event in patients treated with an NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest possible duration. Patients and physicians should remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy and promptly initiate additional evaluation and treatment if a serious GI adverse event is suspected. This should include discontinuation of the NSAID until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out. For high-risk patients, alternate therapies that do not involve NSAIDs should be considered.

### NSAID-induced gastrointestinal injury: a focused update for clinicians [^6ceb4793]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Gastroenterologists care for users of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) when the vast population exposed to the medication class experiences a relatively uncommon serious gastrointestinal (GI) side effect. As serious adverse cardiovascular (CV) effects of these drugs have also been recognized, there remains continued confusion about the best treatment for patients who benefit from NSAID therapy and are at risk for GI and CV adverse events. Recognition of those patients at risk and strategies to reduce the adverse side effects of NSAIDs continues to provide an opportunity to improve patient outcomes. This review discusses the injury induced by these agents throughout the GI tract as well as strategies to prevent acute injury and reduce the development of serious adverse events. NSAID medication selection as well as GI cotherapy should balance individual patients' GI and CV risks.

### Abdominal bloating [^4bd96c18]. Gastroenterology (2005). Low credibility.

Abdominal bloating is a common and significant clinical problem that remains to be scientifically addressed. Bloating is one of the most bothersome complaints in patients with various functional gut disorders. However, in the current standard classification, abdominal bloating is merely regarded as a secondary descriptor, which masks its real clinical effect. Four factors are involved in the pathophysiology of bloating: a subjective sensation of abdominal bloating, objective abdominal distention, volume of intra-abdominal contents, and muscular activity of the abdominal wall. The primer to elicit subjective bloating may be any of the other 3 factors, or the sensation may be related to distorted perception. All of these mechanisms may play an independent role or may be interrelated. Gas transit studies have evidenced that patients with bloating have impaired reflex control of gut handling of contents. Segmental pooling, either of gas or of solid/liquid components, may induce a bloating sensation, particularly in patients with altered gut perception. Furthermore, altered viscerosomatic reflexes may contribute to abdominal wall protrusion and objective distention, even without major intra-abdominal volume increment. Bloating probably is a heterogeneous condition produced by a combination of pathophysiological mechanisms that differ among individual patients and that in most cases are subtle and undetectable by conventional methods. Further advances in the pathophysiology and clinical forms of bloating are warranted to develop mechanistic strategies rather than the current empiric treatment strategies for comprehensive and effective management of this problem.

### Hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen [^5c04a475]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

 Strategies to Minimize the GI Risks in NSAID-treated patients:

- Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest possible duration.

- Avoid administration of more than one NSAID at a time.

- Avoid use in patients at higher risk unless benefits are expected to outweigh the increased risk of bleeding. For high risk patients, as well as those with active GI bleeding, consider alternate therapies other than NSAIDs.

- Remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy.

- If a serious GI adverse event is suspected, promptly initiate evaluation and treatment, and discontinue hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen tablets until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out.

- In the setting of concomitant use of low-dose aspirin for cardiac prophylaxis, monitor patients more closely for evidence of GI bleeding (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions).

 Hepatotoxicity

Elevations of ALT or AST (three or more times the upper limit of normal [ULN]) have been reported in approximately 1% of NSAID-treated patients in clinical trials with NSAIDS. In addition, rare, sometimes fatal, cases of severe hepatic injury, including fulminant hepatitis, liver necrosis, and hepatic failure have been reported.

Elevations of ALT or AST (less than three times ULN) may occur in up to 15% of patients taking NSAIDs including ibuprofen.

### A randomized, controlled comparison of ibuprofen at the maximal over-the-counter dose compared with prescription-dose celecoxib on upper gastrointestinal mucosal injury [^d13cd72c]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2004). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Ibuprofen is a well-tolerated nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), particularly at over-the-counter (OTC) doses. Cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2)-selective inhibitors cause less ulceration than prescription-dose nonselective NSAIDs. We compared endoscopic injury related to nonprescription ibuprofen doses with celecoxib, also comparing prescription doses of naproxen with placebo as a positive control.

Methods

The study was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double blind, double-dummy endoscopic evaluation with concealed allocation. A 2-way crossover with a 4-5-week washout period was used. Participants were healthy adults with normal baseline findings from endoscopy. Ninety-five subjects were randomly assigned, and 79 subjects completed both study phases. Age distribution was reflective of the target population of the OTC agent. Twenty percent were infected with Helicobacter pylori, and 79% and 67% had a current or past medical problem, respectively. Qualifying subjects, stratified by the presence or absence of H. pylori infection (n = 20), were randomly assigned to 1 of the 4 sequences (phase I/II) as follows: ibuprofen/celecoxib; celecoxib/ibuprofen, naproxen/placebo, or placebo/naproxen. Primary end points were the frequency of endoscopic ulcers and erosions in the groups administered: (1) celecoxib vs. ibuprofen and (2) naproxen vs. placebo.

Results

In celecoxib-treated subjects, 2.6% developed ulcers compared with 17.9% of those treated with ibuprofen (P = 0.056). Naproxen treatment was associated with a significantly greater ulceration rate compared with placebo.

Conclusions

Short-term use of the nonselective COX inhibitors ibuprofen and naproxen is associated with a greater risk for endoscopic mucosal injury compared with the COX-2-selective inhibitor celecoxib or placebo. A prospective analysis appropriately powered to address the incidence of clinically significant gastroduodenal ulceration associated with the short-term use of these agents would be required to further define the clinical relevance of these findings.

### Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: overall risks and management. complementary roles for COX-2 inhibitors and proton pump inhibitors [^30146076]. Gut (2003). Low credibility.

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are well recognised as causing peptic ulceration and ulcer complications. However, several critical issues, including the amount of both gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal disease affected by NSAIDs, their interaction with ancillary risk factors, and how to optimise management in subgroups, remain poorly understood. In this article, strategies for subgroups that take account of non-specific gastrointestinal risks, minimisation of residual risk, and the importance of non-gastrointestinal toxicity are suggested, and areas for research identified.

### Mechanisms of damage to the gastrointestinal tract from Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [^15a2a694]. Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can damage the gastrointestinal tract, causing widespread morbidity and mortality. Although mechanisms of damage involve the activities of prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 1 (PTGS1 or cyclooxygenase [COX] 1) and PTGS1 (COX2), other factors are involved. We review the mechanisms of gastrointestinal damage induction by NSAIDs via COX-mediated and COX-independent processes. NSAIDs interact with phospholipids and uncouple mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, which initiates biochemical changes that impair function of the gastrointestinal barrier. The resulting increase in intestinal permeability leads to low-grade inflammation. NSAID inhibition of COX enzymes, along with luminal aggressors, results in erosions and ulcers, with potential complications of bleeding, protein loss, stricture formation, and perforation. We propose a model for NSAID-induced damage to the gastrointestinal tract that includes these complex, interacting, and inter-dependent factors. This model highlights the obstacles for the development of safer NSAIDs.

Gastrointestinal side effects of NSAIDs

Potential GI side effects of NSAID therapy are a concern for physicians. Traditionally, adverse upper-GI-tract effects have been the focus, but there is increasing recognition that lower-GI complications are also an important issue.–Infection with Helicobacter pylori is also relevant and may be more common in some populations.– H. pylori infection increases the risk of GI complications during NSAID therapy, and eradication of H. pylori prior to commencing long-term antiplatelet therapy is recommended to reduce GI risk.

Other risk factors for upper-GI-tract complications during NSAID therapy include older age (≥ 60 years), history of dyspepsia, concomitant use of corticosteroids and/or oral anticoagulants, and a history of peptic ulcer bleeding. In the last few decades, mortality rates in patients with NSAID-associated upper-GI bleed or perforation have increased. Serious GI complications necessitating emergency surgery or hospitalization can occur without prior symptoms. Approximately 60%–80% of arthritis patients hospitalized or requiring surgery for serious GI complications during NSAID therapy report no previous GI symptoms. This highlights the need for a proactive approach to risk management, given that lack of symptoms makes it difficult to intervene before GI events become life-threatening.

Aspirin desensitization protocol in AERD — Desensitization doses are advanced after recovery from reactions with the goal to reach at least 325 mg aspirin daily, which then allows use of any dose of any NSAID without concern of a reaction; some patients may target 81 mg solely for antiplatelet effect but will not be desensitized to higher aspirin doses or other NSAIDs. Protocols vary but generally require 1–3 days, using incremental oral administration over 1–3 days and progressing in steps to a full dose of 325 mg; if desensitization days are not consecutive, patients may continue the highest tolerated dose daily until completion. Aspirin therapy can cause gastritis, epigastric pain, or gastrointestinal bleeding.

### Coprescribing proton-pump inhibitors with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: risks versus benefits [^23c6061a]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Clinical impact

Association of NSAIDs with damage to the lower-GI tract has not been widely studied and remains poorly characterized. NSAID-induced enteropathy has recently gained much attention, due to the introduction of new diagnostic modalities, such as capsule endoscopy and device-assisted enteroscopy, as well as the increased use of acetylsalicylic acid and NSAIDs. The clinical significance and frequency of risks and complications with ns-NSAIDs in the lower-GI tract have been increasingly reported. Lower-GI complications also have worse clinical outcomes compared to upper-GI complications (Figure 3):they lead to higher mortality and longer hospitalization. Although PPIs are prescribed together with NSAIDs as a form of gastroprotection, not only do they not inhibit NSAID enteropathybut also frequent use of PPIs can worsen NSAID-induced small-intestine injury by modifying intestinal microbiota.

In recent years, large randomized controlled trials have begun to analyze the effect of NSAIDs on the entire GI tract, rather than just the upper GI tract. In such studies as CONDORand GI-REASONS, the primary end point was defined as clinically significant events occurring throughout the GI tract. It was seen that celecoxib, a COX2 inhibitor, generally caused fewer upper- and lower-GI events compared to such ns-NSAIDs as naproxen, ibuprofen, and diclofenac. Table 3 highlights a comparison of lower-GI outcomes in a few major studies.

Most patients (80%–100%) have active mucosal lesions in the small bowel after 2 weeks of low-dose NSAID and PPI therapy. Evidence from shorter studies in healthy volunteers has also shown that short-term NSAIDs use can also cause NSAID enteropathy. Maiden et al reported that slow-release diclofenac use for 2 weeks resulted in macroscopic injury to the small intestine in up to 75% of subjects. Goldstein et al also reported that the background incidence of small-bowel lesions in healthy adults was not insignificant, and 2 weeks of naproxen plus omeprazole resulted in small-bowel mucosal breaks in more than half of volunteers. In comparison, celecoxib was associated with significantly fewer small-bowel mucosal breaks than naproxen plus omeprazole (17% versus 55%). Another study comparing celecoxib with ibuprofen/omeprazole found similar results (percentage of subjects with small-bowel mucosal breaks was 25.9% for ibuprofen plus omeprazole compared with 6.4% for celecoxib and 7.1% for placebo).

### What is known about the health effects of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use in marathon and ultraendurance running: a scoping review [^eecaf65c]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2024). High credibility.

GI disturbances

Four of the 30 studies focus on GI issues among the ultrarunners, including one prospective observational study, one review and two case reports. Out of the four studies, none of them found a clear correlation between NSAID use and GI issues.

A prospective observational study by Robertson et al focused on gastrointestinal blood loss and found that overall, there was a significant increase in faecal blood loss when participating in marathon running, and this blood loss was exacerbated by analgesic consumption. However, despite the significant blood loss, it was not clinically important. This study did not focus solely on NSAIDs, and the drugs taken were a combination of aspirin, paracetamol and naproxen. Therefore, it is not possible to distinguish if NSAIDs were the cause.

Case reports by Pasternak et al and Grames et al both document cases of runners taking NSAIDs and then developing GI issues during an endurance race. However, neither study puts NSAID use down as the cause of the GI disturbances. The report by Pasternak et al focuses on a 37-year-old male runner competing in the Western States 100 mile ultra-marathon, where he consumed an NSAID and immediately vomited and experienced severe chest and abdominal pain. He was treated for Boerhaave's syndrome (spontaneous rupture of the oesophagus), and even though the pain seemed to start as soon as an NSAID was consumed, the fact that the patient immediately vomited the drug shows it is unlikely that this was a cause. The case report by Grames et al describes a case of a 20-year-old female runner developing ischaemic colitis at mile 12 of a marathon. The runner took 800 mg of ibuprofen thrice daily for 3 weeks before the marathon; however, the study highlights that it is unclear if the ibuprofen could have contributed to the colitis, so future research is needed in this area.

A potential cause for a relation between NSAID use and GI disturbance is described in a review by Guy et al, which found that prolonged exercise in the heat can cause GI injury, and the consumption of NSAIDs may also compromise GI integrity, which can cause leakage of endotoxins. When the two are combined, there can be an even greater risk of endotoxemia (leakage of endotoxins due to increased GI permeability). However, they acknowledge that further research is required in this area to determine the full impact.

Bile acid sequestrants — the most common side effects are gastrointestinal, including constipation and bloating, and colesevelam appears better tolerated with gastrointestinal adverse effects relatively infrequently (i.e., < 10% of patients); usual doses are 8 to 16 g/day in divided doses for cholestyramine and colestipol and 3.75 g/day for colesevelam; when added to a statin these agents reduce LDL-C by an additional 15–20%; cholestyramine monotherapy reduced CHD events by 19% in 3806 adults without heart disease with LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL over a 7.4 year observation period; because they can worsen triglycerides (TG), especially if baseline TG is ≥ 200 mg/dL, they should mainly be used to reduce LDL-C in patients with TG < 200 mg/dL.

### Time dependent risk of gastrointestinal complications induced by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug use: a consensus statement using a meta-analytic approach [^fbc2ff15]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Objectives

To provide an updated document assessing the global, NSAID-specific, and time dependent risk of gastrointestinal (GI) complications through meta-analyses of high quality studies.

Methods

An exhaustive systematic search was performed. Inclusion criteria were: RCT or controlled study, duration of 5 days at least, inactive control, assessment of minor or major NSAID adverse effects, publication range January 1985 to January 2003. The publications retrieved were assessed during a specifically dedicated WHO meeting including leading experts in all related fields. Statistics were performed conservatively. Meta-regression was performed by regressing NSAID adjusted estimates against study duration categories.

Results

Among RCT data, indolic derivates provided a significantly higher risk of GI complications related to NSAID use than for non-users: RR = 2.25 (1.00; 5.08) than did other compounds: naproxen: RR = 1.83 (1.25; 2.68); diclofenac: RR = 1.73 (1.21; 2.46); piroxicam: RR = 1.66 (1.14; 2.44); tenoxicam: RR = 1.43 (0.40; 5.14); meloxicam: RR = 1.24 (0.98; 1.56), and ibuprofen: RR = 1.19 (0.93; 1.54). Indometacin users had a maximum relative risk for complication at 14 days. The other compounds presented a better profile, with a maximum risk at 50 days. Significant additional risk factors included age, dose, and underlying disease. The controlled cohort studies provided higher estimates: RR = 2.22 (1.7; 2.9). Publication bias testing was significant, towards a selective publication of deleterious effects of NSAIDs from small sized studies.

Conclusion

This meta-analysis characterised the "compound" and "time" aspects of the GI toxicity of non-selective NSAIDs. The risk/benefit ratio of such compounds should thus be carefully and individually evaluated at the start of long term treatment.

### Indomethacin [^c9133f1d]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.2 Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation

NSAIDs, including indomethacin, cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs. Only one in five patients who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy is symptomatic. Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occurred in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3 to 6 months, and in about 2% to 4% of patients treated for one year. However, even short-term NSAID therapy is not without risk.

 Risk Factors for GI Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation

Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding who used NSAIDs had a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients without these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk of GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include longer duration of NSAID therapy; concomitant use of oral corticosteroids, aspirin, anticoagulants, or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs); smoking; use of alcohol; older age; and poor general health status. Most postmarketing reports of fatal GI events occurred in elderly or debilitated patients. Additionally, patients with advanced liver disease and/or coagulopathy are at increased risk for GI bleeding.

 Strategies to Minimize the GI Risks in NSAID-treated patients:

- Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest possible duration.

- Avoid administration of more than one NSAID at a time.

- Avoid use in patients at higher risk unless benefits are expected to outweigh the increased risk of bleeding. For such patients, as well as those with active GI bleeding, consider alternate therapies other than NSAIDs.

- Remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy.

- If a serious GI adverse event is suspected, promptly initiate evaluation and treatment, and discontinue indomethacin until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out.

- In the setting of concomitant use of low-dose aspirin for cardiac prophylaxis, monitor patients more closely for evidence of GI bleeding [see Drug Interactions (7)].

### Fatality after deliberate ingestion of sustained-release ibuprofen: a case report [^ca9967f3]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Discussion

Severe poisoning and death following poisoning with ibuprofen is extremely uncommon. Most cases are either asymptomatic or experience mild gastrointestinal symptoms only. In the case presented here the patient presented after ingestion of up to 105 g sustained-release ibuprofen with a reduced Glasgow Coma Scale, a severe metabolic acidosis and significant haemodynamic compromise. Despite meticulous supportive care initially in the Emergency Department and subsequently in the intensive care unit, attempted correction of her metabolic acidosis and the use of multidose activated charcoal to reduce further ibuprofen absorption from the gastrointestinal tract, the patient did not survive. This is the first reported case of fatality following ingestion of sustained-release ibuprofen and the first fatality following isolated ibuprofen toxicity.

Ibuprofen is a NSAID commonly used as an analgesic, as an anti-pyretic agent and as an anti-inflammatory agent. The predominant pharmacological effect of ibuprofen, similar to other NSAIDs, is to inhibit the activity of cyclooxygenase (both COX-1 and COX-2), leading to an inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis. Following a therapeutic dose of 400 mg, the serum ibuprofen concentration is approximately 28 mg/l (range 17–36 mg/l). Clinical features of toxicity of ibuprofen and other NSAIDs are predictable and occur due to an inhibition of cyclooxygenase activity.

The American Academy of Clinical Toxicology and European Association of Poisons Centres and Clinical Toxicologists have published a position statement on the use of multidose activated charcoal. This position statement, however concentrated on the evidence base for the increased elimination of drugs undergoing enterohepatic/enteric circulation, rather than reducing the absorption of sustained-release or modified-release preparations.

In the case reported here a sustained-release preparation of ibuprofen was ingested, and therefore multidose activated charcoal was recommended to try and reduce further absorption of ibuprofen. The post mortem gastric content ibuprofen concentration was 116 mg/l, suggesting a significant amount of ibuprofen had still not been absorbed more than five hours post-presentation to the Emergency Department. Another patient who was found dead who had recently been prescribed an 800 mg preparation of ibuprofen, presumed to be a sustained-release preparation, had a post mortem total ibuprofen concentration of 131 mg in the gastric contents. Both our case and the other presumed sustained-release case would support the use of multidose activated charcoal in the management of patients who have ingested a sustained-release preparation of ibuprofen in any subsequent cases.

### Lower gastrointestinal adverse effects of NSAIDS: an extreme example of a common problem [^e1f19766]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are commonly prescribed throughout the world. Their adverse effects on the upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract are well documented and well known among clinicians and often mitigated against by coprescribing proton pump inhibitors. This case exemplifies the lesser-known lower GI adverse effects of NSAIDS. A 55-year-old patient took a large mixed overdose including more than 11 g of diclofenac. He went onto require subtotal colectomy following widespread perforations of an ulcerated large bowel as a direct result of exposure to a high-dose of NSAIDs. However, the upper GI tract remained relatively unaffected in comparison. This case highlights important lessons from recent literature identifying an increasing incidence of lower GI complications of NSAIDS, the limited protective effect of PPIs on the lower GI tract and the need for clinicians to now consider the integrity of the whole GI tract when prescribing NSAIDS.

### High-dose ibuprofen therapy associated with esophageal ulceration after pneumonectomy in a patient with cystic fibrosis: a case report [^402d3d79]. BMC Pediatrics (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Lung disease in patients with cystic fibrosis is thought to develop as a result of airway inflammation, infection, and obstruction. Pulmonary therapies for cystic fibrosis that reduce airway inflammation include corticosteroids, rhDNase, antibiotics, and high-dose ibuprofen. Despite evidence that high-dose ibuprofen slows the progression of lung disease in patients with cystic fibrosis, many clinicians have chosen not to use this therapy because of concerns regarding potential side effects, especially gastrointestinal bleeding. However, studies have shown a low incidence of gastrointestinal ulceration and bleeding in patients with cystic fibrosis who have been treated with high-dose ibuprofen.

Case Presentation

The described case illustrates a life-threatening upper gastrointestinal bleed that may have resulted from high-dose ibuprofen therapy in a patient with CF who had undergone a pneumonectomy. Mediastinal shift post-pneumonectomy distorted the patient's esophageal anatomy and may have caused decreased esophageal motility, which led to prolonged contact of the ibuprofen with the esophagus. The concentrated effect of the ibuprofen, as well as its systemic effects, probably contributed to the occurrence of the bleed in this patient.

Conclusions

This report demonstrates that gastrointestinal tract anatomical abnormalities or dysmotility may be contraindications for therapy with high-dose ibuprofen in patients with cystic fibrosis.

### Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and their colonic effects: more interesting than irritating? [^61fbb008]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2002). Low credibility.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have both beneficial and deleterious effects on the colon. Long-term use is associated with a substantial decrease in colorectal cancer incidence and regression of adenomatous polyps. In contrast, significant adverse effects are also interesting, but rare, and include mucosal inflammation and ulceration, exacerbation of inflammatory bowel disease, diverticular bleeding, and diaphragm-like stricturing of the proximal colon. Discontinuation of the offending drug results in symptom resolution in the majority of cases, but some require endoscopic balloon dilation or surgical resection of strictures.

### Bloating in gastroparesis: severity, impact, and associated factors [^cc61e89e]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

Bloating is commonly reported in gastroparesis, but its prevalence, impact, and associated factors are uninvestigated. We aimed to quantify the prevalence of bloating in gastroparesis and relate its severity to clinical factors and quality of life.

Methods

Survey, examination, and scintigraphy data were compared in 335 gastroparesis patients from 6 centers of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) Gastroparesis Clinical Research Consortium. Bloating severity was stratified using Gastroparesis Cardinal Symptom Index (GCSI) bloating subscale scores.

Results

Bloating severity of at least mild (GCSI ≥ 2) and severe (GCSI ≥ 4) grades were reported by 76 and 41% of patients, respectively. Bloating severity related to female gender (P < 0.0001) and overweight status (P = 0.04) on regression analysis and correlated with intensity of nausea, postprandial fullness, visible distention, abdominal pain, and altered bowel function (P < 0.05). Disease etiology, smoking status, and gastric emptying did not relate to bloating subset (P > 0.05). Disease-specific quality of life and general measures of well-being were progressively impaired with increasing bloating severity (P = 0.01). Probiotic use (P = 0.03) and use of antidepressants with significant norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor activity (P = 0.045) use related to bloating severity; antiemetic use trended higher with worsening bloating (P = 0.06).

Conclusions

Bloating is prevalent in gastroparesis and is severe in many individuals. Bloating severity relates to female gender, body weight, and intensity of other symptoms. The symptom impairs quality of life but is not influenced by gastric emptying rates. Antiemetics, probiotics, and antidepressants with significant norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor activity may affect reports of bloating. These findings provide insight into this underappreciated symptom of gastroparesis.

### A review of the gastrointestinal safety data – a gastroenterologist's perspective [^6ccc3186]. Rheumatology (2010). Low credibility.

The need for a new endpoint in NSAID outcome studies

Previously, outcome studies with NSAIDs have focused on adverse events affecting the upper GI tract, in view of the well-established association between NSAIDs and such complications. However, given the strong evidence that NSAIDs also damage the lower GI tract, and that this can have important consequences for the patient, there is a strong case for evaluating the impact of such complications in prospective outcome studies. This will require the use of an endpoint that captures both upper and lower GI events.

Studies that have reported lower GI complications in NSAID-treated patients have used a variety of endpoints, ranging from changes in intestinal permeability resulting from mucosal damage to overt clinical complications such as perforation, ulceration or bleeding. In general, however, the clinical endpoints of NSAID-induced damage to the lower GI tract are not well defined, and the impact of those that have already been described is unclear. Thus, reliable endpoints that evaluate the entire GI tract are needed for NSAID outcome studies.

### Consensus about managing gastrointestinal and cardiovascular risks of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs? [^d6504a90]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

As life expectancy in many countries increases into the 80s and beyond, degenerative joint disease is creating an increasing burden for patients and healthcare systems. For osteoarthritis especially, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAID) remain the most effective option for pain relief, short of surgical alternatives such as joint replacement. However, gastrointestinal (GI) ulcers and their complications are well-known NSAID side effects that are more prevalent in the elderly and are, at times, life-threatening.

The recognition that NSAIDS damage the stomach and duodenum (at least partly) by blocking the mucosal production of protective prostaglandins catalyzed by cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 led to the development of COX-1-sparing NSAIDs. These selectively inhibit COX-2, which mediates synthesis of pro-inflammatory prostaglandins. The strategy has been successful: highly selective COX-2 inhibitors do reduce (but do not eliminate) the risk of GI ulceration. However, an unanticipated risk that surfaced in several randomized studies was an increase in adverse cardiovascular (CV) events in patients taking COX-2 inhibitors for months or years. The European Medicines Agency responded promptly, stating, in 2005, that ' COX-2 inhibitors must not be used in patients with established ischaemic heart disease and/or cerebrovascular disease… '. On the other hand, the US Food and Drug Agency (FDA), in the same year, declined to make such a limiting statement – noting that it was unclear whether COX-2 inhibitors carried a greater vascular risk than the older non-selective NSAIDs (nsNSAIDs), that further research was required, and that in the meantime warnings about the possibility of increased CV risk with all NSAIDs should be included in drug labeling.

### Sulindac [^241aeb32]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Gastrointestinal Effects – Risk of Ulceration, Bleeding, and Perforation

NSAIDs, including sulindac tablets, can cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs. Only one in five patients, who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy is symptomatic. Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occur in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3–6 months, and in about 2–4% of patients treated for one year. These trends continue with longer duration of use, increasing the likelihood of developing a serious GI event at some time during the course of therapy. However, even short-term therapy is not without risk.

NSAIDs should be prescribed with extreme caution in those with a prior history of ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or gastrointestinal bleeding who use NSAIDs have a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients with neither of these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk for GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include concomitant use of oral corticosteroids or anticoagulants, longer duration of NSAID therapy, smoking, use of alcohol, older age, and poor general health status. Most spontaneous reports of fatal GI events are in elderly or debilitated patients and therefore, special care should be taken in treating this population.

To minimize the potential risk for an adverse GI event in patients treated with an NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest possible duration. Patients and physicians should remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy and promptly initiate additional evaluation and treatment if a serious GI adverse event is suspected. This should include discontinuation of the NSAID until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out. For high risk patients, alternate therapies that do not involve NSAIDs should be considered.

### Improving on our goal to reduce NSAID-induced GI complications: a challenging task? [^76ff2d30]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

A large number of at-risk patients treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) do not receive prophylaxis for gastrointestinal (GI) complications. The combination of a 10-min physician educational intervention and a computer alert has been proved to increase the rate of prescribing gastroprotective therapy for high-risk patients who receive ulcerogenic drugs at hospital discharge from 45% to 67%. This improvement is remarkable; still, more than 30% of these high-risk patients did not receive appropriate therapy. Considering that most patients who receive NSAIDs are outpatients treated by generalists, and considering that adherence may be poor and self-medication with NSAIDs is common among patients with GI risk factors, closing the gap between patients treated with NSAIDs who do and do not receive adequate GI prophylaxis is a challenging endeavor. In order to more effectively pursue this goal, we will need to develop new and more complex approaches.

### The hidden costs of arthritis treatment and the cost of new therapy – the burden of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug gastropathy [^90fa1e6d]. Rheumatology (2002). Low credibility.

Pain is very common throughout the world and is an increasing problem in the ageing population. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are widely prescribed to treat pain and many are also available without prescription, or over the counter. These drugs are effective painkillers, but they can also have severe adverse effects, particularly on the upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Therapeutic decisions should be made using the best available evidence and there is a growing body of evidence showing that the new specific cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors, or coxibs, are effective pain killers that do not cause GI harm. The risks associated with the use of NSAIDs are substantial, with a 1 in 1200 chance of dying from a major GI adverse effect after 2 months of NSAID therapy. These risks increase with age and are avoidable. The costs associated with the prevention and treatment of NSAID-induced GI adverse effects can more than double the cost of the original therapy and should be included when costing NSAID interventions. Taking these costs into account, the expense of switching from a conventional NSAID to a coxib is relatively modest. Compared with other interventions that society may be willing to consider to prevent one death, such as those for the rail (15 million Pounds) and road (100,000 Pounds) networks in the UK, the cost of preventing one death by switching to a coxib is much lower, with a high estimate being 20,000–30,000 Pounds, which is in line with the accepted benchmarks for the cost-effectiveness of medical interventions.

### AGA clinical practice update on evaluation and management of belching, abdominal bloating, and distention: expert review [^023a3e3f]. Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) best practice advice for management of belching, abdominal bloating, and distention includes the following statements. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 2: Treatment options for supragastric belching may include brain–gut behavioral therapies, either separately or in combination, such as cognitive behavioral therapy, diaphragmatic breathing, speech therapy, and central neuromodulators. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 9: When dietary modifications are needed (eg, low-fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols), a registered dietitian is recommended to help implement a successful and sustainable diet while avoiding negative sequelae of overly restrictive eating patterns. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 10: Probiotics should not be used to treat abdominal bloating and distention. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 11: Biofeedback therapy may be effective for bloating and distention when a pelvic floor disorder is identified. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 12: Central neuromodulators (eg, antidepressants) are used to treat bloating and abdominal distention by reducing visceral hypersensitivity, raising sensation threshold, and improving psychological comorbidities. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 13: Medications used to treat constipation should be considered for treating bloating if constipation symptoms are present. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 14: Psychological therapies, such as hypnotherapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, and other brain–gut behavior therapies, may be used to treat patients with bloating and distention. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 15: Diaphragmatic breathing and central neuromodulators are used to treat abdominophrenic dyssynergia.

### AGA clinical practice update on evaluation and management of belching, abdominal bloating, and distention: expert review [^d296f3bb]. Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Treatment of belching — clinicians should first communicate the definition and pathophysiology of gastric and supragastric belching to the patient to establish an understanding and to implement collaborative treatment. Impedance monitoring has helped educate patients, similar to biofeedback therapy for pelvic floor disorders, by objectively demonstrating their physical symptoms as the first step toward treatment when belching is a behavioral disorder and not a consequence of reflux. In belching disorder due to supragastric belching, the reflux episodes are typically nonacidic, which may explain the lack of response to proton pump inhibitors. Recent studies suggested that supragastric belching before reflux activity does not respond to proton pump inhibitor therapy, but supragastric belching after the reflux episodes does. The most effective suggested treatment for supragastric belching has been behavioral strategies, which include helping the patient become aware of the reasons for their symptoms. Diaphragmatic breathing (see video: https://romedross.video/3azBfEE) increases vagal tone, inducing relaxation and reducing stress response, and is a treatment option for supragastric belching. In addition, belching associated with GERD symptoms improves when diaphragmatic breathing is combined with proton pump inhibitor therapy. Similarly, CBT reduces supragastric belching episodes and esophageal acid exposure, improving QOL.

### Prevention of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-associated gastrointestinal symptoms and ulcer complications [^43b778ff]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) produce symptoms of dyspepsia and peptic ulcer disease in up to 50% and up to 20%, respectively, of individuals taking them. Risk factors for NSAID-related gastric injury include age > 70 years, history of ulcer disease, use of multiple agents (e.g., ≥ 2 NSAIDs, or an NSAID plus aspirin — even at cardioprotective doses), high doses of an NSAID, and concurrent use of corticosteroids or anticoagulants. In NSAID users, infection with Helicobacter pylori can produce additive or synergistic gastric mucosal injury. Several clinical strategies can decrease the risk for dyspepsia, ulceration, and the more serious complications in NSAID users. Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) co-therapy has been shown to lower the incidence of dyspepsia in those taking NSAIDs. In those with an active ulcer, PPI therapy produces ulcer healing even in "tough-to-treat" individuals who require ongoing NSAID therapy. Maintenance of ulcer healing is significantly greater in those who receive ongoing PPI treatment compared with placebo, and adverse events and treatment withdrawals are fewer compared with their occurrence in persons treated with misoprostol. In those not receiving aspirin therapy, the use of an NSAID that is a selective inhibitor of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 may result in fewer gastrointestinal symptoms compared with a traditional agent; however, studies have failed to show any decrease in healthcare resource utilization (including outpatient or emergency room visits, hospitalization rate, or use of any resource) with COX-2-selective therapy.

### Reducing NSAID-induced gastrointestinal complications [^b626fc03]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2011). Low credibility.

Around 17 million items for non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are prescribed annually in England alone.1 These drugs are associated with upper gastrointestinal complications.2 For example, each year, NSAIDs cause about 3,500 hospitalisations for, and 400 deaths from, ulcer bleeding in people aged 60 years or above.3 Aspirin, even in low doses, is also associated with gastrointestinal complications.4 5 Here we assess strategies for reducing gastrointestinal complications induced by NSAIDs, including aspirin and selective inhibitors of cyclo-oxygenase-2 (coxibs).

### Naproxen (SALLUS pain relief collection with naproxen) [^a7cb1e8b]. FDA (2016). Low credibility.

These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs. Only one in five patients, who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy, is symptomatic. Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occur in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3–6 months, and in about 2–4% of patients treated for one year. These trends continue with longer duration of use, increasing the likelihood of developing a serious GI event at some time during the course of therapy. However, even short-term therapy is not without risk. The utility of periodic laboratory monitoring has not been demonstrated, nor has it been adequately assessed. Only 1 in 5 patients who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy is symptomatic.

NSAIDs should be prescribed with extreme caution in those with a prior history of ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or gastrointestinal bleeding who use NSAIDs have a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients with neither of these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk for GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include concomitant use of oral corticosteroids or anticoagulants, longer duration of NSAID therapy, smoking, use of alcohol, older age, and poor general health status. Most spontaneous reports of fatal GI events are in elderly or debilitated patients and therefore, special care should be taken in treating this population. To minimize the potential risk for an adverse GI event in patients treated with an NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest possible duration. Patients and physicians should remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy and promptly initiate additional evaluation and treatment if a serious GI adverse event is suspected. This should include discontinuation of the NSAID until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out. For high risk patients, alternate therapies that do not involve NSAIDs should be considered.
