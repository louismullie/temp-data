## Question

Treatment for klebsiella UTI

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the treatment options for Klebsiella urinary tract infections. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about classifying the UTI syndrome and severity. Then, I should verify risk factors for resistance and obtain cultures before antibiotics when feasible. Next, I will consider empiric therapy choices by scenario, followed by definitive therapy once susceptibilities return. After that, I need to check duration, IV-to-oral switch criteria, and special populations. Finally, I will review outcomes data, stewardship, and a concise algorithm to tie this together, making sure I double-check any conflicting statements as I go.

> Let me first confirm the clinical classification because treatment hinges on it. Uncomplicated cystitis is lower-tract disease in nonpregnant, immunocompetent women without structural abnormalities, whereas complicated UTI includes pyelonephritis, male patients, catheters, obstruction, recent urologic procedures, or immunocompromise; severity ranges from mild to sepsis, and this stratification drives both empiric breadth and route of therapy, so I need to ensure I place the patient correctly before choosing drugs [^116uTTsD] [^115EMcVZ].

> Wait, let me verify resistance risk factors before I jump to broad-spectrum empiric therapy. Prior ESBL colonization or infection, recent broad-spectrum beta-lactam exposure, healthcare association, long-term care residence, travel to regions with high ESBL prevalence, and prior fluoroquinolone use all increase the likelihood of ESBL or CRE Klebsiella; I should also remember that Klebsiella is a common uropathogen in older adults and those with comorbidities, which further elevates resistance risk, so I need to ask about these explicitly and incorporate them into empiric choices [^112WEVzq] [^112qhcUu] [^113vKokq].

> I should confirm that obtaining urine cultures before antibiotics is ideal whenever feasible, especially in complicated presentations or those with resistance risks, because it enables timely de-escalation and improves stewardship. If the patient is septic or unstable, I must not delay empiric therapy, but I should still send cultures immediately and then tailor within 24–48 hours once results return [^115EMcVZ].

> Now, for empiric therapy in uncomplicated cystitis, let me think about first-line oral options with good urinary activity. Nitrofurantoin, TMP-SMX, and fosfomycin are standard choices, but I need to check Klebsiella coverage carefully: nitrofurantoin has variable activity against Klebsiella and is not reliable for all strains, so I should avoid it if local resistance is high or if prior cultures suggest poor susceptibility; TMP-SMX or a fluoroquinolone such as ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin are reasonable alternatives when susceptibility is likely, keeping in mind stewardship cautions for fluoroquinolones [^117RCSCu] [^115Ah4Gv] [^1144HZfT].

> Hold on, I should verify newer oral options for women with limited alternatives. Pivmecillinam has recent FDA approval for uUTI and demonstrated activity against Enterobacterales including Klebsiella, and sulopenem (with probenecid) has also shown noninferiority to amoxicillin/clavulanate in uUTI. Gepotidacin, a first-in-class oral agent, is now approved for uUTI in females aged 12 years and older and includes Klebsiella coverage, so these can be considered when first-line agents are unsuitable or resistance is a concern [^112BZxh4] [^115ZBWec] [^112Vrvyv].

> For empiric therapy in complicated UTI or pyelonephritis, I need to ensure coverage for ESBL-producing Enterobacterales if risk factors are present. Initially, I thought piperacillin-tazobactam would be a good empiric choice for ESBL-E pyelonephritis, but wait, I should double-check guideline direction. IDSA suggests TMP-SMX or a fluoroquinolone if susceptible, and if resistance or severity precludes those, a carbapenem such as ertapenem, meropenem, or imipenem-cilastatin is preferred, with meropenem or imipenem favored in critically ill or hypoalbuminemic patients. Piperacillin-tazobactam is not suggested for ESBL-E pyelonephritis or cUTI, so I should correct that earlier inclination and avoid it in this setting [^114SRmeB] [^115rp3Xo].

> But wait, what if the patient is critically ill or septic? In that case, I should not delay appropriate broad-spectrum therapy. Meropenem or imipenem-cilastatin are preferred carbapenems, and if there is concern for CRE, I should consider adding an aminoglycoside or using a beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combination with reliable CRE activity while awaiting susceptibilities. I need to ensure I narrow promptly once cultures return to minimize collateral damage [^115rp3Xo] [^117Nsaet].

> For suspected CRE, I should confirm that preferred agents include ceftazidime-avibactam, meropenem-vaborbactam, or imipenem-cilastatin-relebactam, with cefiderocol as another preferred option. For OXA-48–like producers, ceftazidime-avibactam is preferred and cefiderocol is an alternative, whereas meropenem-vaborbactam and imipenem-relebactam have limited activity and are not suggested. I should also remember that aminoglycosides can be effective alternatives for cUTI when susceptible, and that polymyxins are generally avoided except as a last-resort alternative for uncomplicated CRE cystitis due to toxicity and inferior outcomes [^117Nsaet] [^1121i1EA] [^116CDg2U].

> Let me now examine definitive therapy once susceptibilities return, because timely de-escalation is essential. If the organism is ESBL-producing and the patient is clinically improving, I can often complete therapy with an active oral fluoroquinolone or TMP-SMX if susceptible, whereas carbapenems remain appropriate when oral options are inactive or not tolerated; if cefepime was started empirically for cystitis and the patient is better, I need not change, but I should avoid cefepime for ESBL-E pyelonephritis or cUTI given reliability concerns and the potential for discordant clinical outcomes [^114SRmeB] [^11515DY3].

> For CRE, I should confirm that preferred definitive options include TMP-SMX, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin if susceptible, with ceftazidime-avibactam, meropenem-vaborbactam, imipenem-cilastatin-relebactam, or cefiderocol as preferred beta-lactam options when appropriate. Aminoglycosides such as plazomicin or amikacin are reasonable alternatives when active, and I should avoid polymyxins except for the narrow scenario of uncomplicated CRE cystitis when no better oral option exists. I also need to consider source control for obstructive or device-related infections to prevent persistent bacteriuria [^117Nsaet] [^113TCsBM] [^116CDg2U].

> I should double-check duration recommendations because they vary by syndrome and severity. Uncomplicated cystitis is typically treated for 5–7 days with nitrofurantoin or TMP-SMX, or as a single dose with fosfomycin, though local practice patterns vary; for complicated UTI or pyelonephritis, 7–14 days is standard, with longer courses for slow clinical response or prostatic involvement; for catheter-associated UTI with delayed response, 10–14 days is advised; importantly, if initial therapy was inactive but the patient is now improving on an active regimen, I should complete a full course from the start of active therapy rather than extending indefinitely [^117RCSCu] [^116EXLaV] [^111Hu8AB].

> Next, I should review IV-to-oral switch criteria to minimize inpatient days and IV therapy. Switch is appropriate when the patient is hemodynamically stable, afebrile for 24–48 hours, has improving symptoms, and when there is an active oral option based on susceptibilities; I need to ensure the oral agent has adequate bioavailability and tissue penetration for the infection site, and I should document the switch date to anchor the total duration [^116uTTsD] [^111Hu8AB].

> Special populations require tailored choices, so let me consider a few. In pregnancy, I should avoid fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides and favor beta-lactams such as ceftriaxone or amoxicillin-clavulanate, adjusting based on susceptibilities. In pediatrics, many cUTI cases can start with oral therapy if stable, reserving IV agents for sepsis or severe illness, and amikacin retains activity when gentamicin resistance is present. In the elderly, I should be cautious with nephrotoxic agents and adjust doses for renal function, and I should have a lower threshold to evaluate for obstruction or prostatic source if response is slow [^1155TKup] [^1141U6vd] [^116H5jYa].

> I will now examine outcomes data to reinforce the importance of early appropriate therapy. In KPC-producing Klebsiella UTIs, inappropriate empiric therapy and KPC etiology independently increased clinical failure, and 30-day mortality was higher, underscoring the need to risk-stratify and start active therapy promptly. Similarly, in Gram-negative bacteremia, appropriate empiric therapy and early administration correlate with better outcomes, though patient and disease factors also strongly influence mortality, so I should not delay necessary therapy while awaiting perfect data [^112GMCtc] [^115A2LHM].

> Let me reconsider stewardship principles to ensure I am not overusing broad-spectrum agents. I should use the narrowest effective agent, de-escalate based on cultures, avoid fluoroquinolones when alternatives exist due to resistance selection and adverse effects, and minimize carbapenem exposure when oral options are active. I should also remember that for uncomplicated cystitis, even if initial therapy is inactive, clinical improvement often obviates changing or extending therapy, whereas for complicated disease I should correct to an active regimen and complete a full course from that point [^111Hu8AB] [^1144HZfT].

> To synthesize an algorithm, I should confirm the following steps: classify the syndrome and severity. Assess resistance risks and obtain cultures if feasible. Choose empiric therapy accordingly, favoring oral agents for uncomplicated cystitis and broader coverage for complicated disease or sepsis. Narrow to definitive therapy once susceptibilities return. Select an appropriate duration and execute an IV-to-oral switch when criteria are met. And reassess for source control or alternative diagnoses if the patient fails to improve as expected, adjusting therapy based on evolving data and patient factors [^116uTTsD].

Klebsiella UTIs are treated with **culture-guided therapy** [^111Hu8AB] and **carbapenems for ESBL** [^114SRmeB] or **β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitors for CRE** [^117Nsaet], tailored to resistance and severity [^116uTTsD]. For uncomplicated cystitis, use nitrofurantoin, TMP-SMX, or fosfomycin if susceptible [^117RCSCu]; for complicated infection or pyelonephritis, use carbapenems for ESBL [^114SRmeB] and ceftazidime-avibactam, meropenem-vaborbactam, or cefiderocol for CRE [^117Nsaet]. Aminoglycosides or fluoroquinolones are alternatives if susceptible [^114SRmeB]; avoid fluoroquinolones unless no options exist due to resistance and toxicity [^1144HZfT]. Duration is 5–7 days for cystitis [^notfound], 7–14 days for complicated infection or pyelonephritis [^notfound], and 10–14 days for catheter-associated UTI [^116EXLaV]; adjust for clinical response and source control [^116wywDX].

---

## Diagnostic considerations

- **Culture and susceptibility testing**: Essential to identify Klebsiella species and determine antimicrobial susceptibility, guiding targeted therapy [^113vKokq].

- **Clinical assessment**: Differentiate uncomplicated cystitis from complicated UTI or pyelonephritis based on symptoms, comorbidities, and structural abnormalities [^112bLb2m].

---

## Empiric antibiotic therapy

Empiric therapy should be guided by **local resistance patterns** [^1127rChk], patient-specific factors, and illness severity [^116uTTsD].

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended empiric therapy** |
|-|-|
| Uncomplicated cystitis | - Nitrofurantoin <br/> - TMP-SMX <br/> - Fosfomycin (if susceptible) [^117RCSCu] |
| Complicated UTI or pyelonephritis | - Carbapenems (ertapenem, meropenem, imipenem-cilastatin) for ESBL-producing Klebsiella [^115SPMPY] [^114SRmeB] |
| Carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella (CRE) | - Ceftazidime-avibactam <br/> - Meropenem-vaborbactam <br/> - Cefiderocol [^117Nsaet] |

---

## Definitive antibiotic therapy

Definitive therapy should be adjusted to culture and susceptibility results [^115EMcVZ].

- **ESBL-producing Klebsiella**: Carbapenems (ertapenem, meropenem, imipenem-cilastatin) are preferred [^115rp3Xo].

- **CRE infections**: Preferred options include ceftazidime-avibactam, meropenem-vaborbactam, imipenem-cilastatin-relebactam, or cefiderocol [^117Nsaet].

- **Alternative agents**: Aminoglycosides (e.g. plazomicin) [^113TCsBM] or fluoroquinolones (e.g. levofloxacin) [^1144HZfT] may be used if susceptible, though resistance is common [^112Jt5Dh].

---

## Duration of therapy

- **Uncomplicated cystitis**: 5–7 days [^notfound].

- **Complicated UTI or pyelonephritis**: 7–14 days [^notfound].

- **Catheter-associated UTI**: 10–14 days, with catheter removal or replacement when possible [^116EXLaV].

---

## Clinical outcomes and recurrence

Clinical outcomes depend on **antibiotic selection** [^112GMCtc], **timeliness of therapy** [^11731b5i], and **patient-specific factors** [^115wKJq2]. Inappropriate empiric therapy increases the risk of clinical failure and mortality, particularly in infections caused by KPC-producing Klebsiella [^112GMCtc]. Recurrence is common, especially in complicated UTIs, necessitating careful follow-up and management of underlying risk factors [^111Toron].

---

## Special considerations

- **Pediatric patients**: Aminoglycosides or broad-spectrum cephalosporins are recommended for complicated UTIs, with carbapenems reserved for severe cases [^1141U6vd].

- **Immunocompromised patients**: May require prolonged therapy and careful monitoring for complications [^notfound].

- **Pregnancy**: Avoid fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides; consider beta-lactams such as amoxicillin-clavulanate or cephalosporins [^notfound].

---

## Preventive strategies

Preventive strategies include **antimicrobial stewardship** to curb inappropriate antibiotic use and resistance [^116ZLneU], strict infection control with hand hygiene and contact precautions [^114MAVrC], and management of modifiable risk factors such as catheters and structural abnormalities [^112bLb2m]. Klebsiella UTIs require **culture-guided therapy**, with carbapenems for ESBL and β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitors for CRE [^117Nsaet]. Outcomes hinge on timely, appropriate therapy and patient-specific factors, and preventive strategies are essential to reduce recurrence and resistance [^116j5Mhf].

Key points Klebsiellais a type of bacteria normally found in human stool that can cause healthcare-associated infections. Klebsiellacan cause pneumonia, bloodstream infections, wound or surgical site infections, and meningitis.
- Some Klebsiellabacteria are becoming increasingly resistant to antibiotics. Overview Klebsiella is a type of gram-negative bacteria normally found in human stool that can cause HAIs. Klebsiella are becoming increasingly resistant to antibiotics, including carbapenems. Signs and symptoms Klebsiella can cause pneumonia, bloodstream infections, wound or surgical site infections, and meningitis. Who is at risk In healthcare settings, Klebsiella infections commonly occur among sick patients receiving treatment for other conditions.

Patients with devices like ventilators or intravenous catheters, and patients taking long courses of certain antibiotics are most at risk for Klebsiella infections. Healthy people usually do not get Klebsiella infections. How it spreads
- Person-to-person contact.
- Contact with contaminated water or soil.
- Contact with contaminated equipment or intravenous catheters).
- Wounds caused by injury or surgery. Klebsiella does not spread through the air. Prevention Patients Patients should clean their hands often, including:

- Before preparing or eating food.
- Before touching their eyes, nose or mouth.
- Before and after changing wound dressings or bandages.
- After using the restroom.
- After blowing their nose, coughing or sneezing.
- After touching hospital surfaces such as bed rails, bedside tables, doorknobs, remote controls or the phone.

Healthcare providers Healthcare staff should always follow core infection control practices to reduce the risk of spreading these germs to patients. Testing and diagnosis To determine if someone has a Klebsiella infection, healthcare providers will send a specimen to the laboratory. Testing can also determine what treatment will work best. Treatment and recovery Klebsiella infections are generally treated with antibiotics. Unfortunately, some Klebsiella bacteria are resistant to multiple antibiotics, which makes them difficult to treat.

### Urinary tract infections: epidemiology, mechanisms of infection and treatment options [^111Toron]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2015). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a severe public health problem and are caused by a range of pathogens, but most commonly by Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus saprophyticus. High recurrence rates and increasing antimicrobial resistance among uropathogens threaten to greatly increase the economic burden of these infections. In this Review, we discuss how basic science studies are elucidating the molecular details of the crosstalk that occurs at the host-pathogen interface, as well as the consequences of these interactions for the pathophysiology of UTIs. We also describe current efforts to translate this knowledge into new clinical treatments for UTIs.

### Time to appropriate antibiotic therapy is a predictor of outcome in patients with bloodstream infection caused by KPC-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae [^11731b5i]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The spread of Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (Kp) is an urgent public health threat requiring immediate action. As a matter of fact, carbapenem-resistant (CR) Kp infections are associated with high attributable mortality (2118 attributable deaths out of a total of 15,947 infections), and with a median number of total disability-adjusted life years of 11.5 per 100,000 population. Mortality rates of patients with bloodstream infections (BSIs) caused by KPC-Kp range from 40 to 50%.

Treatment of patients with BSIs caused by KPC-Kp represents a challenge for clinicians, and no data from randomized clinical trials comparing different antibiotic strategies are currently available. Observational studies indicate that combination therapies are more effective than monotherapies. Moreover, a retrospective study performed in intensive care unit (ICU) patients with septic shock showed that an antibiotic regimen containing at least two in vitro active antibiotics is associated with improved survival. Novel drugs represent new promising treatment options, but larger studies are needed to evaluate their impact on survival of patients with KPC-Kp infections. Thus, the optimal therapy of KPC-Kp BSI has not been defined.

Timely and appropriate antimicrobial therapy is critically important for treatment of patients with BSI. Recent studies highlighted that inappropriate empiric treatment is associated with poor outcome of patients with urinary tract or any type of infection due to KPC-Kp. Among non-neutropenic patients with BSI due to KPC-Kp, Satlin et al. did not find any association between timing of active therapy and mortality, but a trend to higher mortality rates was observed in patients who did not receive active therapy within the first 12 h from BSI onset; however, the majority of patients (84%) acquired infection in the community or in non-ICU wards. Thus, the relationship between timing of appropriate therapy and outcome of BSI caused by KPC-Kp has not been specifically investigated in ICU patients.

The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between the time to appropriate antibiotic therapy and the clinical outcome in ICU patients with BSI caused by KPC-Kp.

AmpC-producing Enterobacterales (AmpC-E) serious infections — piperacillin-tazobactam use is discouraged except in limited circumstances. The panel suggests against prescribing piperacillin-tazobactam for serious infections caused by AmpC-E, noting at least 4 observational studies identifying poorer clinical outcomes in patients prescribed piperacillin-tazobactam. Piperacillin-tazobactam may be a reasonable treatment option for mild infections such as uncomplicated cystitis, and for other relatively uncomplicated infections it may be reasonable to transition to piperacillin-tazobactam in settings of adverse events to preferred agents or other patient-specific factors. This practice is only advised after clinical improvement has been achieved and if there are no concerns for ongoing sources of infection.

### Bacterial adhesion strategies and countermeasures in urinary tract infection [^114miavC]. Nature Microbiology (2025). High credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are compounded by antimicrobial resistance, which increases the risk of UTI recurrence and antibiotic treatment failure. This also intensifies the burden of disease upon healthcare systems worldwide, and of morbidity and mortality. Uropathogen adhesion is a critical step in the pathogenic process, as has been mainly shown for Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae, Proteus, Enterococcus and Staphylococcus species. Although many bacterial adhesion molecules from these uropathogens have been described, our understanding of their contributions to UTIs is limited. Here we explore knowledge gaps in the UTI field, as we discuss the broader repertoire of uropathogen adhesins, including their role beyond initial attachment and the counter-responses of the host immune system. Finally, we describe the development of therapeutic approaches that target uropathogenic adhesion strategies and provide potential alternatives to antibiotics.

### Tobramycin [^1128c6o4]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

### RESTORE-IMI 1: a multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial comparing efficacy and safety of imipenem / relebactam vs colistin plus imipenem in patients with imipenem-nonsusceptible bacterial infections [^114rwGBH]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Multidrug-resistant (MDR) gram-negative pathogens are endemic worldwide and cause infections associated with high mortality and morbidity. In patients at high risk for poor treatment outcomes (eg, immunocompromised or critically ill), appropriate antibacterial therapy must be initiated promptly to improve survival. Carbapenems are a treatment mainstay in high-risk patients, and carbapenem-resistant pathogens are among the highest-level bacterial threats. To overcome resistance, carbapenems can be combined with suitable β-lactamase inhibitors (BLIs).

Relebactam is a novel non–β-lactam, small-molecule BLI that inhibits class A carbapenemases (eg, Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase [KPC]) and class C cephalosporinases (eg, AmpC), 2 β-lactamases that are frequently involved in carbapenem nonsusceptibility. Relebactam is suitable for combination with the well-established carbapenem imipenem/cilastatin (IMI): inhibiting AmpC frequently restores Pseudomonas aeruginosa susceptibility to imipenem but not other carbapenems, neither agent is subject to efflux in P. aeruginosa, and their pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic profiles complement each other. Combining relebactam with IMI (IMI/REL) can restore IMI activity against many imipenem-nonsusceptible gram-negative pathogens, including extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-, AmpC-, and KPC-producing Enterobacteriaceae. Two phase 2 trials found IMI/REL safe and no less effective than IMI for complicated intraabdominal and urinary tract infections. Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analyses confirmed 500 mg IMI plus 250 mg REL as the optimum IMI/REL dose for further clinical evaluation.

We conducted a randomized, controlled, double-blind trial to compare IMI/REL with colistin-based therapy for imipenem-nonsusceptible, serious, gram-negative bacterial infections. This was a noninferential, descriptive study intended to generate clinical data in this medically important patient population as part of a streamlined drug development program.

### Clinical characteristics, risk factors and outcomes of Klebsiella pneumoniae pneumonia developing secondary Klebsiella pneumoniae bloodstream infection [^114PNqc8]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Klebsiella pneumoniae (KP) is a gram-negative, encapsulated, bacterium in the environment. The bacterium typically colonizes human mucosal surfaces, including the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and oropharynx. Once the bacteria enter the body, they can exhibit a high degree of toxicity and antibiotic resistance. KP pneumonia accounts for approximately 11.8% of all hospital-acquired pneumonia cases cases worldwide and nearly 15% of all cases of pneumonia in developing countries. Patients with KP pneumonia often display a poor prognosis. Even with optimal treatment, the mortality rate of KP pneumonia is between 30 and 50%. KP bloodstream infection (KP-BSI) is one of the most fatal infections and is associated with high mortality ranging from 20 to 40%, whereas mortality was reported to reach 67.6% in ICU patients. The most important prognostic variables in KP-BSI are the main site of infection (i.e. pneumonia more than urinary tract infection), the severity of the underlying disease (i.e. septic shock or a higher APACHE II score) and the adequacy of antimicrobial therapy. Indeed, the prognosis, including hospital stays, mortality and hospitalization costs, is usually worse in patients with KP pneumonia once they are complicated with bacteremia. However, whether the outcomes of patients with KP pneumonia developing into secondary KP-BSI (KP-pneumonia/KP-BSI) would be worse than in the patients with KP-pneumonia alone or which risk factors contribute to the development of secondary KP-BSI from KP pneumonia alone are largely unknown.

### FDA approves new treatment for uncomplicated urinary… [^1125KiD5]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

The U. S. Food and Drug Administration has approved Orlynvah oral tablets for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infection caused by certain bacteria in adult women who have limited or no alternative oral antibacterial treatment options. Orlynvah is not indicated for the primary or step-down treatment of complicated UTI or complicated intra-abdominal infections. Orlynvah is taken as one oral tablet twice daily for 5 days. Disease or Condition An uncomplicated UTI is a bacterial infection of the bladder in women with no structural abnormalities of their urinary tract. Approximately one-half of all women will experience at least one uUTI in their lifetime.

Effectiveness The effectiveness of Orlynvah was evaluated in two phase 3 controlled, randomized, double blind clinical trials which enrolled adult women with uUTI. Orlynvah was administered as one tablet twice daily for 5 days. Trial 1 was a noninferiority trial in which 2214 adult women with uUTI were randomized and treated. Orlynvah demonstrated efficacy in patients with amoxicillin/clavulanate-susceptible pathogens with a composite response rate of 62% compared to a composite response rate of 55% in the amoxicillin/clavulanate group. Trial 2 was a noninferiority trial in which 1660 adult women with uUTI were randomized and treated. Orlynvah demonstrated efficacy in patients with ciprofloxacin-resistant pathogens with a composite response rate of 48% compared to a composite response rate of 33% in the ciprofloxacin group.

Overall, in the two trials combined, 1932 patients were treated with Orlynvah. Clinical trials evaluating Orlynvah for the treatment of patients with cUTI and cIAI did not demonstrate effectiveness. The most common side effects of Orlynvah were diarrhea, nausea, vaginal yeast infection, headache, and vomiting. See the full prescribing information for additional information on risks associated with Orlynvah. Designations This application received Fast Track designation, Qualified Infectious Disease Product designation and Priority Review.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America 2023 guidance on the treatment of antimicrobial resistant Gram-Negative infections [^1121i1EA]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Question 3.6 — infections outside of the urinary tract caused by carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) with OXA-48-like production: Suggested approach: Ceftazidime-avibactam is the preferred treatment option for OXA-48-like-producing Enterobacterales infections. Cefiderocol is an alternative treatment option. If OXA-48-like enzymes are produced by an Enterobacterales clinical isolate, ceftazidime-avibactam is preferred and cefiderocol is an alternative option, and more than 95% of OXA-48-like-producing Enterobacterales isolates are susceptible to both agents. Meropenem-vaborbactam and imipenem-cilastatin-relebactam have limited activity against OXA-48-like producing isolates because vaborbactam and relebactam are unlikely to inhibit OXA-48-like enzymes and are not suggested, even if susceptible in vitro. Clinical trial data comparing ceftazidime-avibactam vs cefiderocol are not available, and an observational study including 171 patients with OXA-48-like-producing Enterobacterales infections treated with ceftazidime-avibactam identified 30-day mortality in 22%.

### The rising threat of antibiotic and multidrug resistance in neonatal urinary tract infections [^113N6eDo]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) in neonates can be associated with sepsis and congenital anomalies of the urinary tract. Early recognition and treatment of UTIs are crucial in preventing the development of renal scarring later in life. Escherichia coli (E. coli) is the most prevalent pathogen in neonates, responsible for approximately 80% to 90% of infections in most large-scale studies. In premature infants, E. coli, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, and Klebsiella are the most commonly identified pathogens.

Antibiotics such as ampicillin, gentamicin, cefotaxime, amikacin, meropenem, and vancomycin are commonly used in the treatment of UTIs in neonates. Empirical therapy is typically initiated with a combination of ampicillin and gentamicin. The appropriate selection of antibiotics is crucial, as empirical treatment, initiated prior to obtaining culture results, has been shown to reduce both mortality and morbidity. However, AMR and the emergence of MDR strains are becoming increasingly prevalent worldwide.

Therefore, regular monitoring of AMR is essential to minimize the use of inappropriate therapies in the treatment of UTIs. The existing literature on MDR UTIs in neonates is limited, with most studies being single-center investigations focused primarily on extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacterales, particularly E. coli. Consequently, the aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical and laboratory findings, the frequency of causative microorganisms, the presence of concomitant urinary tract anomalies, AMR and MDR status, as well as the factors influencing the development of MDR in neonates diagnosed with UTIs.

### Thematic research clusters in very old populations (≥ 80 years): a bibliometric approach [^116H5jYa]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Finally, the cluster around bacterial infections and anti-bacterial agents shows the importance of clinical entities like urinary tract infections and infections associated with the implantation of prostheses, especially those caused by staphylococci and Klebsiella spp. in very old people. Urinary tract infections — often aggravated by bacterial resistance — are the most common infections in this population due to the degenerative nature of the urinary tract, and they are also responsible for worsening patients' functional status. Research addressing this problem has seen notable growth in the past several years around questions like multidrug resistance and the most appropriate treatments for different types of infections.

Limitations

The main limitation of this analysis is that quantitative studies like ours provide a vision based on the research generating the most publications; however, they do not necessarily capture prominent lines of research on emerging or highly specific pathologies. Our results may also underestimate the body of research on diseases that generally develop before people reach such an advanced age, like diabetes, osteoporosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or Parkinson's disease. The individual descriptors for these diseases all stand out as important, but they are not integrated in any of the thematic clusters we identified. Other highly prevalent conditions, for example eye diseases like glaucoma or cataracts, are underrepresented in our findings because there are already well-established pharmacological or surgical treatments available for them, so they attract less research interest. Our use of a descriptor for a human age group led to the exclusion of a large volume of literature that does not exclusively focus on the oldest age groups and probably most basic research that is not explicitly linked to studying very advanced age as a key variable. Finally, our analysis may not have picked up on the full body of research in some psychosocial areas, as it was based on terminology from the MeSH thesaurus, which is mainly rooted in biomedical fields.

In addition, although we observed some very well-defined thematic clusters, multidisciplinary approaches to different pathologies remain vitally important in this population. Not only do a large proportion of very old people have multiple comorbidities, geriatric syndromes like sarcopenia or other conditions provoking the loss of skeletal mass can act as risk factors for pathologies like cardiovascular diseases. These associations are sometimes underrepresented in research.

### Nitrofurantoin oral suspension [^115Ah4Gv]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Nitrofurantoin Oral Suspension, USP is specifically indicated for the treatment of urinary tract infections when due to susceptible strains of Escherichia coli, enterococci, Staphylococcus aureus, and certain susceptible strains of Klebsiella and Enterobacter species.

Nitrofurantoin is not indicated for the treatment of pyelonephritis or perinephric abscesses.

Nitrofurantoins lack the broader tissue distribution of other therapeutic agents approved for urinary tract infections. Consequently, many patients who are treated with Nitrofurantoin Oral Suspension, USP are predisposed to persistence or reappearance of bacteriuria. Urine specimens for culture and susceptibility testing should be obtained before and after completion of therapy. If persistence or reappearance of bacteriuria occurs after treatment with Nitrofurantoin Oral Suspension, USP, other therapeutic agents with broader tissue distribution should be selected. In considering the use of Nitrofurantoin Oral Suspension, USP, lower eradication rates should be balanced against the increased potential for

systemic toxicity and for the development of antimicrobial resistance when agents with broader tissue distribution are utilized.

### Aztreonam (Azactam) [^115Q6jXD]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of AZACTAM (aztreonam for injection, USP) and other antibacterial drugs, AZACTAM should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

AZACTAM is indicated for the treatment of the following infections caused by susceptible Gram-negative microorganisms:

Urinary Tract Infections (complicated and uncomplicated), including pyelonephritis and cystitis (initial and recurrent) caused by Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella oxytoca *, Citrobacter species*, and Serratia marcescens *.

Lower Respiratory Tract Infections, including pneumonia and bronchitis caused by Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter species, and Serratia marcescens *.

Septicemia caused by Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis *, Serratia marcescens *, and Enterobacter species.

Skin and Skin-Structure Infections, including those associated with postoperative wounds, ulcers, and burns, caused by Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter species, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Citrobacter species*.

Intra-abdominal Infections, including peritonitis caused by Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species including K. pneumoniae, Enterobacter species including E. cloacae *, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Citrobacter species* including C. freundii *, and Serratia species* including S. marcescens *.

Gynecologic Infections, including endometritis and pelvic cellulitis caused by Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae *, Enterobacter species* including E. cloacae *, and Proteus mirabilis *.

AZACTAM is indicated for adjunctive therapy to surgery in the management of infections caused by susceptible organisms, including abscesses, infections complicating hollow viscus perforations, cutaneous infections, and infections of serous surfaces. AZACTAM is effective against most of the commonly encountered Gram-negative aerobic pathogens seen in general surgery.

### Urinary tract infections: pathogenesis, host susceptibility and emerging therapeutics [^116j5Mhf]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2025). High credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs), which include any infection of the urethra, bladder or kidneys, account for an estimated 400 million infections and billions of dollars in health-care spending per year. The most common bacterium implicated in UTI is uropathogenic Escherichia coli, but diverse pathogens including Klebsiella, Enterococcus, Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus and even yeast such as Candida species can also cause UTIs. UTIs occur in both women and men and in both healthy and immunocompromised patients. However, certain patient factors predispose to disease: for example, female sex, history of prior UTI, or the presence of a urinary catheter or other urinary tract abnormality. The current clinical paradigm for the treatment of UTIs involves the use of antibiotics. Unfortunately, the efficacy of this approach is dwindling as the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance rises among UTI isolates, and the immense quantity of antibiotics prescribed annually for these infections contributes to the emergence of resistant pathogens. Therefore, there is an urgent need for new antibiotics and non-antibiotic treatment and prevention strategies. In this Review, we discuss how recent studies of bacterial pathogenesis, recurrence, persistence, host-pathogen interactions and host susceptibility factors have elucidated new and promising targets for the treatment and prevention of UTIs.

Duration of therapy and oral step-down — guidance principles: Recommendations on durations of therapy are not provided, and durations may vary if initially inactive therapy was given; uncomplicated cystitis is typically mild and, if clinical improvement occurs despite empiric inactive therapy, it is generally not necessary to repeat urine culture, change the regimen, or extend the planned course, whereas for other infections if AST later indicates inactive empiric therapy, a change to an active regimen for a full treatment course (dated from the start of active therapy) is suggested; host factors and source control should inform duration decisions, and transitioning to oral therapy should be considered when susceptibility to an appropriate oral agent is demonstrated, the patient is hemodynamically stable, source control measures have occurred, and there are no concerns about insufficient intestinal absorption.

### Prognosis of urinary tract infection caused by KPC-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae: the impact of inappropriate empirical treatment [^112GMCtc]. The Journal of Infection (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

There is scarce information on the prognosis of urinary tract infections (UTI) caused by KPC carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (KPC-Kp).

Objetive

To investigate the association between KPC-Kp aetiology and clinical failure and all cause mortality and to explore the impact of inappropriate empirical treatment.

Material and Methods

This is a retrospective observational study of hospitalized patients with UTI due to K. pneumoniae. We explored clinical failure at day 21 and 30-day all-cause mortality using different models of adjusted analysis.

Results

We analyzed 142 episodes of UTI; 46 episodes (32.4%) were due to KPC-Kp and 96 episodes (67.6%) were due to non-KPC-Kp strains (62 wild type and 34 EBSL producer). Clinical failure was more frequent in the KPC-Kp group (41.3% vs. 15.6%, p = 0.001). KPC-Kp aetiology and inappropriate empirical therapy were associated in the non-adjusted analysis with clinical failure. When analysed in separate adjusted models, both were found to be associated; inappropriate empirical treatment (OR 2.51; 95% CI, 1.03–6.12; p = 0.04) and KPC-Kp (OR 2.73; 95% CI, 1.03–7.22; p = 0.04) were associated with increased risk of failure. All-cause 30-day mortality was higher in patients with KPC-Kp UTI (39.1% vs. 15.6%, p = 0.002). Bacteraemia was more frequent in patients with KPC-Kp etiology (23.9% vs. 10.4%; p = 0.034). In both cases, the association was not confirmed in the adjusted analysis.

Conclusion

KPC-Kp UTI is associated with higher clinical failure and may be due to an increase in inappropriate empirical treatment.

### Treatment and clinical outcomes of urinary tract infections caused by KPC-producing enterobacteriaceae in a retrospective cohort [^113PgB7f]. Clinical Therapeutics (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Optimal treatment regimens for infections caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing Enterobacteriaceae are not well-defined.

Objectives

This study describes the treatment and outcomes in patients with urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by KPC-producing Enterobacteriaceae.

Methods

This retrospective cohort study analyzed data from adult inpatients with bacteriuria caused by KPC-positive organisms treated at Barnes-Jewish Hospital from June 1, 2006, to February 1, 2008. KPC-positive isolates were identified utilizing disk-diffusion susceptibility testing and confirmed to contain bla(KPC) via molecular methods.

Results

Twenty-one patients met the inclusion criteria and all were classified as having symptomatic UTI. The majority of patients were female (15/21 [71%]), and the mean (SD) age was 62.4 (15.2) years. Successful clinical and microbiologic responses were observed in 16 patients (76%) for both outcomes. Patients with urinary catheters had them removed or replaced in 9 of 15 cases (60%). Antibiotics active against the isolated pathogen were provided in 14 of 21 cases (67%), often after considerable delay (median, 72.5 hours [range, 4–312 hours]). All 7 patients receiving aminoglycoside therapy had successful clinical and microbiologic responses, and in vitro testing of an extended antibiotic panel revealed high susceptibility rates for tigecycline (28/29 [97%]), minocycline (22/29 [76%]), and fosfomycin (25/29 [86%]) against the KPC-positive isolates.

Conclusions

Although receipt of appropriate therapy was delayed in many cases, clinical outcomes investigated revealed high rates of successful response in this defined group of patients Aminoglycosides and tetracycline derivatives suggested therapeutic promise in the treatment of KPC-producing Enterobacteriaceae UTI.

### Sulopenem versus amoxicillin / clavulanate for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infection [^115ZBWec]. NEJM Evidence (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Existing antibiotics for uncomplicated urinary tract infections are becoming less reliably effective owing to increasing antimicrobial resistance. Our objective was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of sulopenem/probenecid for uncomplicated urinary tract infections.

Methods

We conducted a double-blind, randomized, controlled, noninferiority trial of 5 days of sulopenem versus amoxicillin/clavulanate for women with uncomplicated urinary tract infection. The primary end point was overall success, defined as combined clinical cure and microbiologic eradication by day 12, evaluated in the microbiologic-modified intent-to-treat population, which comprised all randomly assigned patients who received any trial medication and had a positive urine culture with 10⁵ colony-forming units (CFU)/ml or more of an Enterobacterales uropathogen (e.g. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species).

Results

A total of 2222 patients were enrolled, and the median age was 51 years (interquartile range, 35–62 years). Ninety-one (9.2%) patients in the primary population (microbiologic-modified intent-to-treat population), the combined population of patients with a positive baseline urine culture and without regard to amoxicillin/clavulanate susceptibility, had a baseline pathogen resistant to three or more classes of antibiotics. Overall success in the microbiologic-modified intent-to-treat population occurred in 318 of 522 (60.9%) participants treated with sulopenem versus 260 of 468 (55.6%) participants treated with amoxicillin/clavulanate (difference, 5.4 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.8 to 11.5), meeting criteria for noninferiority. In the primary population with a baseline uropathogen susceptible to amoxicillin/clavulanate, success occurred in 296 of 480 (61.7%) participants treated with sulopenem versus 243 of 442 (55.0%) participants treated with amoxicillin/clavulanate (difference, 6.7 percentage points; 95% CI, 0.3 to 13.0). In the primary population with a baseline uropathogen not susceptible to amoxicillin/clavulanate, success occurred in 22 of 42 (52.4%) patients treated with sulopenem versus 17 of 25 (68.0%) patients treated with amoxicillin/clavulanate (difference, -15.6 percentage points; 95% CI, -37.5 to 9.1]. Treatment-emergent adverse events occurred more frequently with sulopenem compared with amoxicillin/clavulanate, including diarrhea (8.1% vs. 4.1%), nausea (4.3% vs. 2.9%), and headache (2.2% vs. 1.5%).

Conclusions

Sulopenem was noninferior to amoxicillin/clavulanate for the treatment of adult women with uncomplicated urinary tract infection, but was associated with more frequent mild adverse events. (Funded by Iterum Therapeutics; REASSURE ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT05584657.).

### The etiology of urinary tract infection: traditional and emerging pathogens [^1149KsGU]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

The microbial etiology of urinary infections has been regarded as well established and reasonably consistent. Escherichia coli remains the predominant uropathogen (80%) isolated in acute community-acquired uncomplicated infections, followed by Staphylococcus saprophyticus (10% to 15%). Klebsiella, Enterobacter, and Proteus species, and enterococci infrequently cause uncomplicated cystitis and pyelonephritis. The pathogens traditionally associated with UTI are changing many of their features, particularly because of antimicrobial resistance. The etiology of UTI is also affected by underlying host factors that complicate UTI, such as age, diabetes, spinal cord injury, or catheterization. Consequently, complicated UTI has a more diverse etiology than uncomplicated UTI, and organisms that rarely cause disease in healthy patients can cause significant disease in hosts with anatomic, metabolic, or immunologic underlying disease. The majority of community-acquired symptomatic UTIs in elderly women are caused by E coli. However, gram-positive organisms are common, and polymicrobial infections account for up to 1 in 3 infections in the elderly. In comparison, the most common organisms isolated in children with uncomplicated UTI are Enterobacteriaceae. Etiologic pathogens associated with UTI among patients with diabetes include Klebsiella spp. Group B streptococci, and Enterococcus spp., as well as E coli. Patients with spinal cord injuries commonly have E coli infections. Other common uropathogens include Pseudomonas and Proteus mirabilis. Recent advances in molecular biology may facilitate the identification of new etiologic agents for UTI. The need for accurate and updated population surveillance data is apparent, particularly in light of concerns regarding antimicrobial resistance. This information will directly affect selection of empiric therapy for UTI.

Enterobacterales at moderate risk for clinically significant AmpC production — third-generation cephalosporins and ceftriaxone use: Available data suggest that the emergence of resistance after ceftriaxone exposure occurs in approximately 20% of infections caused by E. cloacae, K. aerogenes, or C. freundii, and the panel suggests generally avoiding third-generation cephalosporins when treating infections caused by these organisms. Based on the mild nature of uncomplicated cystitis and the sufficient urinary excretion of ceftriaxone, ceftriaxone may be adequate therapy for the management of AmpC-E uncomplicated cystitis, and for other relatively uncomplicated infections it may be reasonable to transition to ceftriaxone after clinical improvement has been achieved and if there are no concerns for ongoing sources of infection, weighing the convenience of once-daily ceftriaxone dosing with the potentially increased risk of emergence of resistance.

### Recurrent urinary tract infections in women: diagnosis and management [^111PCAzk]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Recurrent urinary tract infections, presenting as dysuria or irritative voiding symptoms, are most commonly caused by reinfection with the original bacterial isolate in young, otherwise healthy women with no anatomic or functional abnormalities of the urinary tract. Frequency of sexual intercourse is the strongest predictor of recurrent urinary tract infections in patients presenting with recurrent dysuria. In those who have comorbid conditions or other predisposing factors, recurrent complicated urinary tract infections represent a risk for ascending infection or urosepsis. Escherichia coli is the most common organism in all patient groups, but Klebsiella, Pseudomonas, Proteus, and other organisms are more common in patients with certain risk factors for complicated urinary tract infections. A positive urine culture with greater than 102 colony-forming units per mL is the standard for diagnosing urinary tract infections in symptomatic patients, although culture is often unnecessary for diagnosing typical symptomatic infection. Women with recurrent symptomatic urinary tract infections can be treated with continuous or postcoital prophylactic antibiotics; other treatment options include self-started antibiotics, cranberry products, and behavioral modification. Patients at risk of complicated urinary tract infections are best managed with broad-spectrum antibiotics initially, urine culture to guide subsequent therapy, and renal imaging studies if structural abnormalities are suspected.

### Consensus position statement on advancing the classification of patients and tests of cure in studies of antibiotic treatment of complicated urinary tract infections [^111ndMsp]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Complicated urinary tract infections denote an important research field for new antibiotics against Gram-negative pathogens. There is, however, increasing concern that this disease entity is too vaguely defined, leading to heterogeneous study populations and risk of bias. We analysed researchers' adherence to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance on complicated urinary tract infection and assessed risk of bias using a three-step procedure: literature review of full-text articles on complicated urinary tract infection; assessment of the importance of risk factors for treatment failure, including statistical evaluation of how patients with risk factors might skew treatment effects; and a Delphi consensus process in a multidisciplinary group. Our evaluation showed poor adherence to FDA guidance on complicated urinary tract infection and significant heterogeneity in the reporting of study, patient, and pathogen characteristics, leading to a high risk of bias when interpreting and comparing study findings. We therefore question the concept of complicated urinary tract infection as a meaningful entity with its own study guidance.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^116uTTsD]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) empiric therapy — process to guide choice proposes a four-step approach that includes assessing severity of illness for initial prioritization, considering patient-specific risk factors for resistant uropathogens to optimize coverage, evaluating other patient-specific considerations to reduce adverse events, and for patients with sepsis, consulting a relevant local antibiogram if available.

### Extended-spectrum β-lactamases and clinical outcomes: current data [^115JhTEJ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Nosocomial infections caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing gram-negative bacteria complicate therapy and limit treatment options. However, the clinical significance of infections caused by ESBL-producing bacteria remains unclear. A critical examination of the literature provides divergent views of the effect of ESBL carriage on morbidity and mortality and suggests that ESBL production may have its most marked effect on ceftazidime. Effective strategies for the empirical and directed treatment of infections caused by ESBL-producing pathogens include the use of carbapenems and, possibly, the fourth-generation cephalosporin cefepime. Studies indicate that the use of cefepime to treat serious nosocomial infections (e.g., bacteremia, pneumonia, and urinary tract infections) is associated with high rates of microbiological and clinical success. The probability of attaining time above the minimum inhibitory concentration targets of at least 70% of the dosing interval, an important pharmacodynamic indicator of clinical success, is higher with cefepime than with other antimicrobials against Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae strains exhibiting ESBL phenotypes. However, for non-ESBL-producing strains, there is no difference in the time above the minimum inhibitory concentration between ceftazidime and cefepime. When used appropriately in institutional settings, cefepime reduces the overall use of cephalosporins, thereby decreasing selection pressure for presumptive ESBL-producing pathogens.

### Is it time to reconsider initial antibiotic treatment strategies for severe urinary tract infections in Europe? [^112WEVzq]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2007). Low credibility.

Until recently, most reported cases of bacteraemia caused by multidrug-resistant strains of Enterobacteriacae producing an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) in Europe have been nosocomial in origin. However, increasing numbers of reports of community-acquired bacteraemia and urinary tract infection caused by ESBL-producing microorganisms suggest that the geographical origin of patients should be taken into account as a risk-factor for possible ESBL production. Early identification of patients at high-risk of infection with ESBL-producing microorganisms, based on their geographical origin and travel history, should help to optimise initial antibiotic treatment strategies for severe urinary tract infections in Europe.

Administer ceftazidime/avibactam, meropenem/vaborbactam, imipenem/cilastatin/relebactam, or cefiderocol as other preferred options. Administer aminoglycosides as an alternative option for the treatment of pyelonephritis and complicated UTIs caused by carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales.

### Interpretable machine learning-based decision support for prediction of antibiotic resistance for complicated urinary tract infections [^116VfxPM]. Npj Antimicrobials and Resistance (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Recent years have seen rapid increases in the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in bacterial pathogens, which is threatening the efficacy of many antibiotic therapies, and ultimately leading to treatment failure –. Although new drugs are urgently needed, new antibiotic development is restricted by costs, limited government support, and regulatory requirements. For instance, as of 2019, major pharmaceutical corporations, commonly known as "big pharma", were progressively divesting themselves of antibiotic research and development (R&D) assets. This shift restricts the opportunities available to smaller companies and their investors, leading to heightened financial constraints and a lack of infrastructure for antibiotic R&D.

Furthermore, antibiotic resistance leads to increased reliance on broad-spectrum therapies, which select for further resistance, exacerbating the issue at hand. To avoid these risks, it is critical for clinicians to accurately align available antibiotic therapies with the precise susceptibilities of bacterial pathogens. Ideally, this alignment should occur when initiating empirical treatment, even before culture results are obtained (which might take several days to be available). In this study, we present interpretable machine learning (ML)-based methods for predicting antimicrobial resistance (AMR), which decreases the risk of non-susceptible and therefore, ineffective treatment, and facilitates rapid effective clinical intervention. We demonstrate the utility of these systems for urinary tract infections (UTIs), where the problem of antibiotic resistance is of particular importance.

UTIs are one of the most common bacterial infections worldwide, affecting more than 150 million people each year. The pathogens that cause UTIs, including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus saprophyticus, can be carried asymptomatically and thus, are frequently exposed to antibiotics, including those intended for other infections. This exposure, combined with high recurrence rates, often results in multidrug-resistant strains, with resistance rates of over 20% for commonly used drugs. As treatment-outcome is associated with the infecting pathogen's susceptibilities, clinicians are faced with the challenging task of correctly prescribing patients with the most appropriate antibiotics. However, to offer rapid intervention, treatment is commonly administered empirically, lacking insight into the specific antibiotics that the infecting pathogen may be susceptible to. This scenario adds to the potential of choosing an inadequate treatment regimen.

### Treatment for infections with carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae: what options do we still have? [^115ZZ8x3]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Recently, a double-carbapenem combination (ertapenem-doripenem) has been proposed as a potential treatment strategy for KPC-producing bacteria. Data come from in vitro experiments on a murine animal model as well as in vivo. Regarding the latter, three patients with bacteremia or urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by pan-resistant KPC-producing K. pneumoniae and one ICU patient with bacteremia and sepsis caused by colistin-resistant KPC-producing K. pneumoniae were reported to have been successfully treated with a double-carbapenem combination. Most recently, Karaiskos and colleagues reported treating 14 patients with bacteremias and UTIs, including two patients with septic shock caused by KPC-producing K. pneumoniae with double-carbapenems therapy, as follows: 1 g ertapenem IV daily, followed 1 hour later by meropenem at 2 g every 8 hours infused over 3 hours. All treated patients experienced clinical and microbiological cure at 1-month follow-up, although four patients experienced a recurrence of their UTI. Nevertheless, since the clinical experience with this salvage therapy is still limited, concerns for promoting further carbapenem resistance remain, and the MICs of many carbapenem-producing organisms are sufficiently high to render carbapenems ineffective, this treatment strategy is not routinely recommended for clinical practice at the present time.

### Antibiotic resistance of urinary tract infection recurrences in a large integrated US healthcare system [^117KNEPb]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Data on antibiotic resistance of uropathogens for urinary tract infection (UTI) recurrences are lacking.

Methods

In a retrospective cohort of adults at Kaiser Permanente Southern California with culture-confirmed index uncomplicated UTI (uUTI) between January 2016 and December 2020, we examined the number and characteristics of subsequent culture-confirmed UTIs through 2021.

Results

We identified 148 994 individuals with a culture-confirmed index uUTI (88% female, 44% Hispanic; mean age, 51 years [standard deviation, 19 years]), of whom 19% developed a subsequent culture-confirmed UTI after a median 300 days (interquartile range, 126–627 days). The proportion of UTI due to Escherichia coli was highest for index uUTI (79%) and decreased to 73% for sixth UTI (UTI 6) (P for trend < .001), while the proportion due to Klebsiella spp increased from index UTI (7%) to UTI 6 (11%) (P for trend < .001). Nonsusceptibility to ≥ 1 and ≥ 3 antibiotic classes was observed in 57% and 13% of index uUTIs, respectively, and was higher for subsequent UTIs (65% and 20%, respectively, for UTI 6). Most commonly observed antibiotic nonsusceptibility patterns included penicillins alone (12%), and penicillins and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole plus ≥ 1 additional antibiotic class (9%).

Conclusions

Antibiotic nonsusceptibility is common in UTIs and increases with subsequent UTIs. Continuous monitoring of UTI recurrences and susceptibility patterns is needed to guide treatment decisions.

### The impact of initial antibiotic treatment failure: real-world insights in patients with complicated urinary tract infection [^115hPZpf]. The Journal of Infection (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

RECOMMEND (NCT02364284; D4280R00005) assessed treatment patterns and outcomes associated with initial antibiotic therapy (IAT; antibiotics received < 48 h post-initiation of antibiotic therapy) in healthcare-associated infections across five countries.

Methods

Data from medical records of hospitalized patients aged ≥ 18 years with healthcare-associated complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI) are presented. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses identified potential risk factors associated with IAT failure.

Results

Mean (SD) age was 68.7 (17.4) years (n = 408). In patients with microbiological documentation (357/408), Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were most common (47.1%, 21.6% and 11.8%, respectively); 46.1% of patients had a multidrug resistant (MDR) pathogen isolated. Most patients received monotherapy IAT (72.5%). Mean IAT duration was 7.8 days. IAT failure, in-hospital mortality, and mortality 30-day post-discharge were 54.4%, 35.0% and 37.3%, respectively. IAT failure was associated with age, Deyo-Charlson comorbidity score, country, MDR status and ICU admission in the univariate analysis; and country and age in the multivariate analysis.

Conclusions

This study provides real-world insights into the high rates of IAT failure and morbidity observed in patients with cUTI. Further study is imperative to understand the epidemiology of cUTI, support appropriate IAT selection and management, and reduce the burden of this disease.

### Estimated undertreatment of carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacterial infections in eight low-income and middle-income countries: a modelling study [^116Q1v5T]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

We made some adjustments to the total CRGN bacterial infection-related deaths from the GRAM study to ensure that our estimates were as conservative as possible and accurately reflected the deaths of patients from infections that required treatment with an agent with specific activity against CRGN bacterial infections. The first adjustment attempted to account for the fact that, for the selected countries, the literature shows that although resistance remains high, up to 30% of carbapenem-resistant P aeruginosa isolates might be sensitive to other antibiotics (eg, fluoroquinolones). Thus, we conservatively removed 40% of the deaths caused by carbapenem-resistant P aeruginosa from the total CRGN bacterial infection-related deaths. For the second adjustment, we excluded a proportion of deaths related to complicated urinary tract infections (UTI), primarily to exclude deaths of patients with infections that could be treated with aminoglycoside monotherapy in line with current guidelines; data from the literature suggest that up to 40% of complicated UTIs caused by CRGN bacteria in LMICs are susceptible to aminoglycosides. Thus, for this second adjustment, we assumed that of the 40% of complicated UTIs caused by CRGN bacteria potentially susceptible to aminoglycosides, 85% could have been successfully treated with aminoglycoside monotherapy, and we removed 35% (ie, 40% of 85%) of complicated UTIs caused by CRGN bacteria from further calculations (further details are in the appendix [p 1]).

Next, we estimated an overall case fatality rate for CRGN bacterial infections. We began by pooling available estimates from the literature, to calculate an overall distribution of CRGN bacterial infection types considered the major drivers of mortality according to the GRAM study(ie, bloodstream infections, lower respiratory tract infections, intra-abdominal infections, and UTIs). We multiplied these estimates by literature-based case fatality rates for each of these infection types (table 1) to obtain an overall weighted case fatality rate for CRGN bacterial infections. Due to the low availability of high-quality data in LMICs, estimates for infection distribution and case fatality rates were drawn from data for adults in high-income countries in North and South America, Europe, and Asia; these infection-specific case fatality rates were drawn from estimated case fatality rates for treated adults identified as having a CRGN infection (predominantly carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella). We tested variation in the overall case fatality rate with robustness tests.

In a retrospective cohort of adults at Kaiser Permanente Southern California with culture-confirmed index uncomplicated UTI (uUTI) between January 2016 and December 2020, we examined the number and characteristics of subsequent culture-confirmed UTIs through 2021.

Results

We identified 148 994 individuals with a culture-confirmed index uUTI (88% female, 44% Hispanic; mean age, 51 years [standard deviation, 19 years]), of whom 19% developed a subsequent culture-confirmed UTI after a median 300 days (interquartile range, 126–627 days). The proportion of UTI due to Escherichia coli was highest for index uUTI (79%) and decreased to 73% for sixth UTI (UTI 6) (P for trend < .001), while the proportion due to Klebsiella spp increased from index UTI (7%) to UTI 6 (11%) (P for trend < .001). Nonsusceptibility to ≥ 1 and ≥ 3 antibiotic classes was observed in 57% and 13% of index uUTIs, respectively, and was higher for subsequent UTIs (65% and 20%, respectively, for UTI 6). Most commonly observed antibiotic nonsusceptibility patterns included penicillins alone (12%), and penicillins and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole plus ≥ 1 additional antibiotic class (9%).

Conclusions

Antibiotic nonsusceptibility is common in UTIs and increases with subsequent UTIs. Continuous monitoring of UTI recurrences and susceptibility patterns is needed to guide treatment decisions.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America 2023 guidance on the treatment of antimicrobial resistant Gram-Negative infections [^114SRmeB]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Question 1.2 — ESBL-producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E) pyelonephritis or complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) treatment: Suggested approach states that TMP-SMX, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin are preferred treatment options for pyelonephritis or cUTIs caused by ESBL-E, with ertapenem, meropenem, and imipenem-cilastatin preferred when resistance or toxicities preclude TMP-SMX or fluoroquinolones, and aminoglycosides as alternative options. The rationale specifies that these agents are preferred assuming in vitro susceptibility; carbapenems are also preferred when resistance or toxicities prevent use or early if the patient is critically ill, and if a carbapenem is initiated and susceptibility to TMP-SMX, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin is demonstrated, transitioning to oral formulations is preferred over completing a carbapenem course. Aminoglycosides are considered alternative because of nephrotoxicity risk; in a clinical trial of 609 adults receiving plazomicin once daily compared to meropenem for cUTI and pyelonephritis, an increase in serum creatinine of ≥ 0.5 mg above baseline occurred in 7% vs 4%. Additional considerations include that in 2023 the CLSI revised gentamicin, tobramycin, and amikacin breakpoints for Enterobacterales; aminoglycosides may be reasonable for completing treatment courses given prolonged renal cortical activity and convenience of once daily dosing, and duration-dependent nephrotoxicity risks should be considered. Fosfomycin is not suggested for pyelonephritis or cUTI given limited renal parenchymal concentrations; more data are needed, and a clinical trial of 97 women with E. coli pyelonephritis reported approximately half with bacteremia, up to 5 days of IV therapy, and participants subsequently transitioned to either once-daily 3 g.

### Levofloxacin [^1144HZfT]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

1.11 Acute Pyelonephritis: 5 or 10-day Treatment Regimen

Levofloxacin tablets are indicated in adult patients for the treatment of acute pyelonephritis caused by Escherichia coli, including cases with concurrent bacteremia [see Clinical Studies (14.7, 14.8)].

1.12 Uncomplicated Urinary Tract Infections

Levofloxacin tablets are indicated in adult patients for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections (mild to moderate) due to Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, or Staphylococcus saprophyticus.

Because fluoroquinolones, including levofloxacin tablets, have been associated with serious adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1 to 5.15)] and for some patients uncomplicated urinary tract infection is self-limiting, reserve levofloxacin tablets for treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections in patients who have no alternative treatment options.

1.13 Acute Bacterial Exacerbation of Chronic Bronchitis

Levofloxacin tablets are indicated in adult patients for the treatment of acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis (ABECB) due to methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, or Moraxella catarrhalis.

Because fluoroquinolones, including levofloxacin tablets, have been associated with serious adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1 to 5.15)] and for some patients ABECB is self-limiting, reserve levofloxacin tablets for treatment of ABECB in patients who have no alternative treatment options.

### Consensus review of the epidemiology and appropriate antimicrobial therapy of complicated urinary tract infections in Asia-Pacific region [^1127rChk]. The Journal of Infection (2011). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most prevalent infectious diseases in the general population. They cause a substantial financial burden in the community and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality, particularly in hospitals. With increased rates of antimicrobial resistance, especially in the Asia-Pacific region, treatment of complicated UTIs (cUTIs) can be challenging for clinicians. Consideration of an optimal antimicrobial agent should be based on local resistance patterns, patient-specific factors, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic principles, and cost. In the Asia-Pacific region, nearly half of Escherichia coli urinary isolates were resistant (including intermediate and resistant) to levofloxacin or ciprofloxacin and ≥ 30% were resistant to third-generation cephalosporins (cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, and ceftazidime) and cefepime. Overall, 33% of urinary E. coli isolates exhibited extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing phenotypes. Prevalence of ESBL-producing urinary E. coli was highest in India (60%), followed by Hong Kong (48%) and Singapore (33%). All urinary isolates of E. coli were susceptible to both ertapenem and imipenem. All urinary isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae were susceptible to imipenem and 4% of them were resistant to ertapenem. Care should be exercised when using trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), fluoroquinolones, and cephalosporins for the empirical treatment of UTIs, particularly cUTI among moderately to severely ill patients. Empiric antimicrobial treatment for serious cUTIs in which risk factors for resistant organisms exist should include broad-spectrum antibiotics such as carbapenems (ertapenem, imipenem, meropenem, and doripenem) and piperacillin-tazobactam. Aminoglycosides, tigecycline, and polymyxins (colistin or polymyxin B) can be used for the treatment of multidrug-resistant organisms or serious cUTIs when first-line options are deemed inappropriate or patients fail therapy. Because of considerable variability in different countries, local epidemiological data is critical in the effective management of UTIs in the Asia-Pacific region.

### Trimethoprim [^116cCYUa]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS & USAGE

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of trimethoprim tablets, USP and other antibacterial drugs, trimethoprim tablets, USP should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

For the treatment of initial episodes of uncomplicated urinary tract infections due to susceptible strains of the following organisms: Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter species, and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species, including S. saprophyticus.

Cultures and susceptibility tests should be performed to determine the susceptibility of the bacteria to trimethoprim. Therapy may be initiated prior to obtaining the results of these tests.

### Cefoxitin versus carbapenems as definitive treatment for extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae bacteremia in intensive care unit: a propensity-matched retrospective analysis [^1175K86Y]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Since the 1990s, the emergence and diffusion of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E) has been a global concern. In 2021, the rate of invasive ESBL-E isolates has reached 7.5% in French healthcare settings. ESBL-E infections treatment is becoming challenging due to high frequency of co-resistance mechanisms to other antibiotics classes, such as fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides; therefore, therapeutic options are often very limited. Carbapenems have long been considered to be the reference treatment for infections caused by ESBL-E. Unfortunately, their large prescription constitutes a strong selective pressure, which has led to the emergence and rapid worldwide spread of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales.

One possible alternative to carbapenems could be cefoxitin, a cephamycin developed in the 1970s, resistant to ESBL hydrolysis and highly active against ESBL-E in vitro. Currently, cefoxitin is the standard treatment for perioperative surgical prophylaxis, and is proposed as second-line antibiotic therapy for acute ESBL- Escherichia coli (ESBL-EC) pyelonephritis in adults. Indeed, cefoxitin and other cephamycins have been shown to be effective in several small cases series of mild infections, such as urinary tract infections and bacteremia without signs of severity. In a multicenter retrospective study, Senard et al. showed no significant difference in clinical and microbiological success between cefoxitin and carbapenems as the definitive treatment of ESBL-EC urinary tract infections in men.

ESBL- Klebsiella pneumoniae (ESBL-KP) infections are also common nosocomial infection, but clinical data on their treatment with cefoxitin are scarce. In Guadeloupe University Hospital, the observed incidence rate of nosocomial ESBL-E infections is one of the highest in France, with a large predominance of Klebsiella pneumoniae. Since 2015, to limit the use of carbapenems, antibiotic guidelines in our intensive care unit (ICU) proposed cefoxitin rather than carbapenems as definitive treatment in cefoxitin-susceptible ESBL-E systemic infections, whenever clinical condition and microbiological findings are compatible. Until now this therapeutic strategy had not been formally evaluated. The aim of our study was thus to compare the clinical efficacy of cefoxitin as definitive antibiotic therapy for ICU patients with ESBL-KP bacteremia, versus standard carbapenem therapy. Selection of cefoxitin- and carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales in both groups was also analyzed.

### Gram-negative bacteraemia; a multi-centre prospective evaluation of empiric antibiotic therapy and outcome in english acute hospitals [^115wKJq2]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2016). Low credibility.

Increasing antibiotic resistance makes choosing antibiotics for suspected Gram-negative infection challenging. This study set out to identify key determinants of mortality among patients with Gram-negative bacteraemia, focusing particularly on the importance of appropriate empiric antibiotic treatment. We conducted a prospective observational study of 679 unselected adults with Gram-negative bacteraemia at ten acute english hospitals between October 2013 and March 2014. Appropriate empiric antibiotic treatment was defined as intravenous treatment on the day of blood culture collection with an antibiotic to which the cultured organism was sensitive in vitro. Mortality analyses were adjusted for patient demographics, co-morbidities and illness severity. The majority of bacteraemias were community-onset (70%); most were caused by Escherichia coli (65%), Klebsiella spp. (15%) or Pseudomonas spp. (7%). Main foci of infection were urinary tract (51%), abdomen/biliary tract (20%) and lower respiratory tract (14%). The main antibiotics used were co-amoxiclav (32%) and piperacillin-tazobactam (30%) with 34% receiving combination therapy (predominantly aminoglycosides). Empiric treatment was inappropriate in 34%. All-cause mortality was 8% at 7 days and 15% at 30 days. Independent predictors of mortality (p < 0.05) included older age, greater burden of co-morbid disease, severity of illness at presentation and inflammatory response. Inappropriate empiric antibiotic therapy was not associated with mortality at either time-point (adjusted OR 0.82; 95% CI 0.35–1.94 and adjusted OR 0.92; 95% CI 0.50–1.66, respectively). Although our study does not exclude an impact of empiric antibiotic choice on survival in Gram-negative bacteraemia, outcome is determined primarily by patient and disease factors.

### Pathogen-focused clinical development to address unmet medical need: cefiderocol targeting carbapenem resistance [^114cFpCc]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Historically, the regulatory requirements of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for developing new antibiotics have not addressed pathogen-focused indications for drug approval. The design of the necessary randomized controlled trials traditionally involves the enrollment of patients with site-specific infections caused by susceptible as well as resistant pathogens. Cefiderocol has undergone a streamlined clinical development program to address serious carbapenem-resistant infections. The regulatory approach, and the pivotal clinical trials, differed between the FDA and EMA. In the United States, the APEKS-cUTI (Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Stenotrophomonas –complicated urinary tract infection) study was conducted to provide the basis for FDA approval of a site-specific cUTI indication. The EMA, however, preferred the CREDIBLE-CR (A MultiCenter, RandomizED, Open-label ClInical Study of S-649266 or Best AvailabLE Therapy for the Treatment of Severe Infections Caused by Carbapenem-Resistant Gram-negative Pathogens) study, in which patients with nosocomial pneumonia, bloodstream infections, or cUTIs were enrolled if they had a carbapenem-resistant pathogen. The resulting European label will be pathogen focused rather than infection site specific (ie, treatment of gram-negative infection in patients with limited treatment options). The implications and limitations of these different regulatory processes are discussed.

### Clinical outcomes with ertapenem as a first-line treatment option of infections caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase producing gram-negative bacteria [^1132qDRh]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Infections caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing gram-negative organisms are a growing concern in hospitalized patients. Traditionally, these infections can be effectively treated by the carbapenem class of drugs. In 2005, our institution initiated a protocol for use of ertapenem, a carbapenem, as the first-line treatment option for these infections. It is unknown whether ertapenem is associated with similar clinical response and microbiologic cure rates as those achieved with group 2 carbapenems (imipenem, meropenem, doripenem).

Objective

To describe clinical response and microbiologic cure rates associated with ertapenem as first-line treatment of infections caused by ESBL-producing organisms.

Methods

This case series included patients who received ertapenem for more than 48 hours to treat a documented infection with a positive culture for an ESBL-producing organism. Efficacy was determined by the clinical response and microbiologic cure rates achieved with ertapenem.

Results

Seventy-three patients received ertapenem for a mean (SD) of 10.7 (5.9) days. The most common (59%) infection site was urine. The most common causative organisms were ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (47%) and Escherichia coli (48%). Clinical response was observed in 78% of patients. Microbiologic cure was achieved in 92% of the evaluable population (n = 50). There were no significant differences in clinical or microbiologic cure rates across important subgroups.

Conclusions

Patients treated with ertapenem achieved favorable clinical response and microbiologic cure rates. Our data suggest that ertapenem can be used as an alternative to group 2 carbapenems for the treatment of infections caused by ESBL-producing gram-negative organisms.

### Is piperacillin-tazobactam effective for the treatment of pyelonephritis caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing organisms? [^112wumTy]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Limited data exist regarding the efficacy of piperacillin-tazobactam (TZP) for the management of nonbacteremic pyelonephritis caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing organisms.

Methods

We conducted a multicenter observational study comparing clinical outcomes of adults hospitalized with ESBL-producing pyelonephritis who were receiving TZP versus carbapenems, using an inverse probability of treatment weighted propensity score analysis. Patients were eligible for inclusion if all of the following criteria were met: (1) urine cultures growing Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, or Proteus mirabilis at ≥ 50 000 colony-forming units/mL; (2) identification of an ESBL gene; (3) pyuria (≥ 10 white blood cells per high powered field in the urine); and (4) dysuria and fever plus at least 1 of the following symptoms: emesis, rigors, hypotension, or flank pain.

Results

There were 186 patients included in the propensity score-weighted cohort; 45 (24%) received TZP and 141 (76%) received a carbapenem. Of these 186 patients, 27% were admitted to the intensive care unit, 48% were immunocompromised, and 45% had underlying urologic abnormalities. There were no differences between the 2 groups in the proportion of patients (20% vs 25%) with recurrent cystitis or pyelonephritis with the same ESBL-producing organism within 30 days (odds ratio, 0.75; 95% confidence interval, .31–1.81; p = 0.52). There were no differences in the resolution of clinical symptoms by Day 7 or in 30-day mortality. There was 1 (2%) patient in the TZP arm and 11 (8%) patients in the carbapenem arm who had incident carbapenem-resistant organisms isolated within 30 days (P = 0.09).

Conclusions

TZP may be a reasonable alternative to carbapenems for the management of ESBL-producing pyelonephritis and may mitigate the risk of emergence of carbapenem-resistant organisms, compared with carbapenem therapy.

### Risk factors for recurrent urinary tract infections among women in a large integrated health care organization in the United States [^112bLb2m]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most common bacterial infections, with an estimated annual incidence of > 150 million cases worldwide. In the United States, UTIs result in approximately 10.5 million office visits as well as 3 million emergency department (ED) encounters and 400 000 hospitalizations annually with an estimated annual cost > $4.8 billion. UTIs primarily affect women, followed by male infants and older men. Based on epidemiologic data from a study in the United States, about 1 in 3 women have at least 1 UTI diagnosed by a clinician that requires antibiotic medication, and the lifetime risk of UTIs among women is > 60%.

Clinically, UTIs are categorized as uncomplicated or complicated. Uncomplicated UTIs (uUTIs) can be differentiated into lower (cystitis) and upper (pyelonephritis). uUTIs typically affect individuals who are otherwise healthy. Approximately 75% of uUTIs are caused by extraintestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae and other pathogens. Complicated UTIs are associated with factors compromising the urinary tract or host defense, such as urinary obstruction, immunosuppression, renal failure/transplantation, and indwelling catheterization. In the United States, 70% to 80% of complicated UTIs are attributable to indwelling catheters, accounting for 1 million cases per year.

1.4 Uncomplicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections

Cefepime for Injection is indicated in the treatment of uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible isolates only) or Streptococcus pyogenes.

1.5 Complicated Intra-abdominal Infections (used in combination with metronidazole)

Cefepime for Injection is indicated in the treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections (used in combination with metronidazole) in adults caused by susceptible isolates of Escherichia coli, viridans group streptococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter species, or Bacteroides fragilis [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

1.6 Usage

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Cefepime for Injection and other antibacterial drugs, Cefepime for Injection should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy.

Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) management — men with febrile, bacteremic urinary tract infection in whom acute bacterial prostatitis is suspected may benefit from a longer treatment duration (i.e., 10–14 days), although evidence to guide the optimal duration in this subgroup is lacking. Consider evaluation for an ongoing nidus of infection requiring source control in patients who do not have prompt clinical improvement. This recommendation places a high value on antibiotic stewardship considerations as well as reducing the burden of antimicrobial administration from a healthcare perspective and reducing the burden of taking antibiotics from a patient perspective. Refer to Figure 1.3 for a stepwise assessment of the intravenous to oral switch and the duration of antibiotic therapy.

### Development of a urinary-specific antibiogram for gram-negative isolates: impact of patient risk factors on susceptibility [^112qhcUu]. American Journal of Infection Control (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Traditional antibiograms guide clinicians in selecting appropriate empiric antimicrobials, but they lack data on syndrome/disease-specific susceptibility, isolate location, polymicrobial infections, and patient risk factors. The aim of this study was to develop a urinary-specific antibiogram and to evaluate the impact of risk factors on antimicrobial susceptibility.

Methods

This retrospective descriptive study used culture and susceptibility data from January 1 to December 31, 2012. A urinary antibiogram specific for Escherichia coli (EC), Proteus mirabilis (PM), Klebsiella pneumoniae (KP), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) was developed. Urinary and standard antibiogram susceptibilities were compared. Urinary isolates were then stratified by risk factors-residence before admission, age, systemic antimicrobial use for ≤ 30 days, hospitalization for ≤ 30 days, and hospital unit-to determine the impact on antimicrobial susceptibility.

Results

There were 2,284 urinary isolate encounters. Overall antimicrobial susceptibility was increased, and the prevalence of extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing isolates was significantly greater (KP, 14% vs 7% [P = 0.001]; EC, 13% vs 9% [P < .001]; PM, 18% vs 10% [P = 0.004]) in the urinary antibiogram vs the standard antibiogram. Health care facility residence had the greatest impact on susceptibility for all urinary isolates, especially on fluoroquinolone susceptibility for EC and PM.

Conclusions

Using a syndromic antibiogram and incorporating patient risk factors into susceptibility data may be more useful in guiding clinicians in selecting more appropriate empiric therapy.

In April 2024-over 40 years after its first approval in Europe-pivmecillinam received approval from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infection (uUTI) in women aged ≥ 18 years, caused by susceptible isolates of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, and Staphylococcus saprophyticus. Herein, we describe the reanalysis from previously published clinical trials, conducted in accordance with current FDA efficacy criteria, which formed the basis for this regulatory approval.

Methods

Of 14 studies reviewed, 3 randomized, controlled trials offered suitable subject-level data from patients with uUTI treated with 185 mg pivmecillinam 3 times daily for 3–7 days. Efficacy endpoints for reanalysis were rates of overall (composite clinical and microbiological), clinical, and microbiological response in the microbiological intention-to-treat population (urine culture ≥ 105 colony-forming units/mL; ≤ 2 microorganism species; no baseline pathogen nonsusceptible to active comparator).

Results

Across the 3 primary studies, overall success rates with pivmecillinam at test of cure (Days 7–15) were 62.0%-71.7% (clinical success, 63.5%-82.7%; microbiological success, 74.3%-86.9%). Overall success was higher for pivmecillinam than for placebo (95% confidence interval for the difference, 41.2–62.0) or ibuprofen (31.2–56.5) and similar to cephalexin (-15.6 to 7.4). Response to pivmecillinam was demonstrated in uUTIs caused by Enterobacterales, including E. coli, P. mirabilis, and Klebsiella pneumoniae, as well as gram-positive S. saprophyticus.

Conclusions

This reanalysis of randomized, controlled trial data confirmed the efficacy of oral pivmecillinam in uUTI and was used to support its recent approval in the United States.

Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) — polymyxins: Polymyxin B and colistin are not suggested for the treatment of infections caused by CRE, with colistin an alternative agent for uncomplicated CRE cystitis; the panel suggests these agents be avoided for CRE infections, and Polymyxin B should not be used as treatment for CRE cystitis. Observational and clinical data indicate increased mortality and excess nephrotoxicity with polymyxin-based regimens relative to comparator agents, supporting avoidance except for the noted cystitis exception.

### American Urogynecologic Society best-practice statement: recurrent urinary tract infection in adult women [^117RCSCu]. Female Pelvic Medicine & Reconstructive Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

First-line antimicrobial agents — IDSA-aligned options and nitrofurantoin regimen: In the Infectious Disease Society of America guidelines for premenopausal women, 3 first-line antibiotics for UTI treatment are recommended — nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), and fosfomycin — and recommendations are extrapolated for rUTI, older women, and women with urogynecologic disorders. Nitrofurantoin is bacteriostatic and therapeutically active only in the lower urinary tract; it is effective against E. coli and many gram-negative species with low levels of resistance but is ineffective against some Proteus species and some strains of Enterobacter and Klebsiella. The duration of treatment is typically 7 to 10 days; a meta-analysis of women ranging from 12 to 70 years old concluded that 5-day regimens are as effective (not necessarily generalizable to women with rUTI), and the 2010 "International clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of acute uncomplicated cystitis in women" recommends a 5-day regimen of 100 mg orally twice daily. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that covers gram-positive bacteria including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and most gram-negative bacteria.

### Antibiotic resistance of urinary tract infection recurrences in a large integrated US healthcare system [^111wiGoG]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most common bacterial infections in the United States (US), primarily affecting women. In the US, half of women experience ≥ 1 UTI by the age of 35 years, and 1 in 3 women experiences ≥ 1 UTI requiring antibiotic treatment in her lifetime, with 11% experiencing ≥ 1 UTI per year. UTI incidence in the US increased by 52% between 1998 and 2011, resulting in 400 000 hospitalizations with an estimated cost of $2.8 billion in 2011. UTIs have also been increasing in outpatient settings and cause substantial negative impact on activity and health-related quality of life.

Uropathogenic Escherichia coli is the most common pathogen causing UTIs. Escherichia coli accounts for up to 80% of uncomplicated UTIs (uUTIs), which typically affect otherwise healthy individuals without underlying structural abnormalities or instrumentation, and approximately a quarter of complicated UTIs (cUTIs), which occur in the presence of structural abnormalities or instrumentation compromising the urinary tract. Other gram-negative pathogens such as Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and gram-positive pathogens such as Staphylococcus spp, Enterococcus faecalis, and group B Streptococcus can also cause UTIs. Following an initial uUTI, subsequent UTIs are common and may be caused by the same or different pathogens.

Antibiotic treatment for UTI is often empiric without urine culture or susceptibility testing, and is usually based on national guidelines and local resistance profiles. The Infectious Diseases Society of America recommends trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), nitrofurantoin, or fosfomycin as first-line therapy. UTIs also have a high recurrence rate, leading to increased use of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance. Antibiotic resistance in uropathogens has been increasing, resulting in increased risk of treatment failure, patient morbidity, healthcare costs, and use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, further exacerbating antibiotic resistance.

Given the continued burden of UTIs, current data on repeated occurrence of UTI are needed. Also, despite global increases in multidrug resistance (MDR), recent data on antibiotic resistance of uropathogens are lacking, especially antibiotic resistance patterns for those patients experiencing UTI recurrences. Leveraging electronic health records (EHR) from a cohort of individuals with uUTI at Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC), we described the antibiotic resistance of subsequent uUTIs and cUTIs (from 2016–2021) following an initial uUTI (from 2016–2020).

### Urinary tract infection in male patients: challenges in management [^112TE65A]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections in male patients share many of the management principles as used in the management of female patients, including the need to accurately define the clinical syndrome, choose empirical therapy based on the severity of illness and the potential for antimicrobial resistance, and consider the need for source control in severely ill patients. The microbiology of the causative organisms is more unpredictable compared to female patients, and data to inform treatment decisions from clinical trials specific to male patients are relatively scarce.

### Impact of extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella species on clinical outcomes and hospital costs: a matched cohort study [^1155PeaH]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate the economic and clinical impact of infection with extended-spectrum beta -lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella species (ESBL-EK).

Design

A matched-cohort analysis of the cost of illness.

Setting

An 810-bed, urban, community hospital in Hartford, Connecticut.

Patients

Twenty-one case patients infected with ESBL-EK at a site other than the urinary tract were matched with 21 control subjects infected with a non-ESBL-producing organism on the basis of pathogen species, age, anatomic site of infection, hospitalization in the intensive care unit (ICU) during the time of infection, date of hospitalization, and initial antibiotics received.

Results

Mean infection-related costs per patient were significantly greater for case patients than for control patients ($41,353 vs $24,902; p = 0.034). Infection-related length of stay was the main driver of cost, which was prolonged for case patients, compared with control patients (21 vs 11 days; mean difference, 9.7 days [95% confidence interval {CI}, 3.2–14.6 days]; p = 0.006). The additional cost attributed to the presence of an ESBL-EK infection was $16,450 per patient (95% CI, $965-$31,937). Case patients were more likely than control patients to have clinical failure (P = 0.027), and the rate of treatment success for case patients whose initial treatment involved antibiotics other than carbapenems was lower than that for their matched control patients (39% vs 83%; p = 0.013). Treatment was successful in patients for whom initial treatment was with a carbapenem, regardless of the ESBL status of the pathogen.

Conclusion

The cost of non-urinary tract infections caused by ESBL-EK was 1.7 times the cost of non-urinary tract infections caused by non-ESBL producers. Prompt recognition and appropriate antimicrobial selection may minimize this ESBL-related impact on hospital costs.

### Guidelines for complicated urinary tract infections in children: a review by the European society for pediatric infectious diseases [^1141U6vd]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Common uropathogens in children with significant urologic abnormalities, including postsurgery and instrumentation, are Enterobacterales, P. aeruginosa, Enterococcus spp. and Staphylococcus aureus.– To cover these, if IV antibiotics are needed, an aminoglycoside or broad-spectrum cephalosporin is recommended, with a child's individual history guiding whether to cover rarer S. aureus or more indolent Enterococcus spp. empirically. Where multiple antibiotics have previously been used, assessment of the likelihood of resistance is part of management (see below).

Multiple recurrent UTIs, defined by 2 or more UTIs caused by different organisms, are a risk for resistant and MDR bacteria. Although recurrent UTIs might occur without anomalies of the kidneys and urinary tract, other risk factors include VUR, underlying neurological conditions, prolonged hospitalization and UTI prophylaxis, and girls are at higher risk than boys. If on prophylaxis, a different treatment antibiotic is required due to breakthrough. For children at high risk of resistance, including suspected ESBL-E, empiric oral options include nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, quinolones and fosfomycin. Empirical IV options for children at moderate risk of resistance but who have never cultured ESBL-E include gentamicin and quinolones. If there has been previous ESBL-E or clinical risk is higher, IV amikacin retains high susceptibility to uropathogens, concentrates well in urine and can avoid broad-spectrum beta-lactam and carbapenem use. Most gentamicin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae exhibit cross-resistance to tobramycin but remain susceptible to amikacin, due to reduced inactivation by bacterial enzymes. If cultures grow Klebsiella pneumoniae with high bacterial inoculum, empirical B-lactam antibiotics should be switched to a different class. With a high bacterial inoculum, the stationary phase is rapidly reached, so the effect of targeting penicillin-binding proteins is rapidly diminished, and an alternative is better. In the large majority, carbapenems should be spared since their use is the greatest risk for developing carbapenem resistance. Even with a history of recurrent UTI with resistant uropathogens, empirical carbapenems are rarely needed in children with cUTI unless a child presents with sepsis (see below). – If the identified uropathogen is MDR, including carbapenem-resistant, options include a carbapenem plus amikacin combination, colistin and newer B-lactam/B-lactamase antibiotics such as ceftazidime-avibactam. Since methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) is an uncommon uropathogen, this rarely needs to be covered empirically. P. aeruginosa (susceptible and resistant) is more common in recurrent UTIs, so it should be empirically treated with oral quinolones or IV aminoglycosides.

### Ciprofloxacin hydrochloride (proquin) [^1142eqNf]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Proquin XR is indicated only for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections (acute cystitis) caused by susceptible strains of the designated microorganisms listed below. Proquin XR is not interchangeable with other ciprofloxacin extended-release or immediate release oral formulations. See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION for specific recommendations.

Uncomplicated urinary tract infections (acute cystitis) caused by Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae.

THE SAFETY AND EFFICACY OF PROQUIN XR IN TREATING PYELONEPHRITIS, COMPLICATED URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS, AND INFECTIONS OTHER THAN UNCOMPLICATED URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS HAVE NOT BEEN DEMONSTRATED. Alternative therapy should be considered for patients who remain symptomatic or develop fever and back pain while on treatment with Proquin XR.

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Proquin XR and other antibacterial drugs, Proquin XR should only be used to treat uncomplicated urinary tract infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and sensitivity information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

### The role of carbapenems in initial therapy for serious Gram-negative infections [^115A2LHM]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

The treatment of patients with serious Gram-negative infections must be both prompt and correct. Numerous studies have demonstrated that mortality risk is significantly increased when the initial antibiotic regimen does not adequately cover the infecting pathogen. Furthermore, changing to an appropriate regimen once culture results are available does not reduce this risk. Therefore, one must empirically treat serious infections with a regimen that covers likely pathogens. Selecting such a regimen is complicated by the increasing prevalence of resistance to commonly used antibiotics. Moreover, multidrug-resistant pathogens, once limited to hospital-acquired infections, are increasingly being detected in community-acquired infections, especially those involving the urinary and gastrointestinal tracts or in immunocompromised patients. Consequently, the initial antibiotic regimen must have a broad spectrum of activity that includes potential resistant pathogens, as indicated by the local antibiogram. Many multidrug-resistant pathogens remain susceptible to carbapenems despite increasing worldwide antibiotic resistance. This article reviews the role played by carbapenems in the initial treatment of serious Gram-negative infections and the potential effect of emerging resistance on this role.

### Current antibiotic resistance patterns of rare uropathogens: survey from central European urology department 2011–2019 [^116ZLneU]. BMC Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

With approximately 150–250 million cases occurring globally per year, urinary tract infections (UTIs) represent some of the most common infectious diseases in humans. Gram-negative enteric bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp. and Proteus spp. are their most common causative agents. UTIs occur more frequently among women than in men: 50% of females will experience at least one UTI in their lifetime. Recurrences are common and besides associated morbidity, UTIs put pressure on health care systems, too. While the cost of treatment of a single UTI episode is insignificant, their frequent incidence means they consume a non-negligible part of the health care budget: in France alone, the expense for adult female UTIs amounted to 58 million euro in 2012. Complicated UTIs are even more costly: one episode of a complicated UTI costs between 4028 and 7740 euro depending on the health care system.

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has become a major concern threathening many an advance of medicine in the twenty-first century. Uropathogenic microorganisms are no exception to this: rates of AMR among Enterobacteriaceae are increasing globally, albeit with temporal and spatial differences. Antibiotic consumption is a primary driver for the spread of AMR as evidenced on local and country levels. For instance, southern European states exhibit higher AMR rates than northern ones. Of note, four top antibiotic prescribers in Europe (Greece, Cyprus, France and Italy) belong among south European countries.

International guidelines for UTI treatment are freely available; yet, poor antibiotic prescription remains common. Thirty percent of primary care antibiotic prescriptions were inadequate in a report from the United States. Appropriate antibiotic treatment was reported in 68% of adult cystitis cases and only 46% of pyelonephritis cases in another survey.

### Lomefloxacin hydrochloride (Maxaquin) [^1146q1xc]. FDA (2006). Low credibility.

Treatment

Maxaquin (lomefloxacin HCl) film-coated tablets are indicated for the treatment of adults with mild to moderate infections caused by susceptible strains of the designated microorganisms in the conditions listed below: (See Dosage and Administration for specific dosing recommendations.)

LOWER RESPIRATORY TRACT

Acute Bacterial Exacerbation of Chronic Bronchitis caused by Haemophilus influenzae or Moraxella catarrhalis.

NOTE: MAXAQUIN IS NOT INDICATED FOR THE EMPIRIC TREATMENT OF ACUTE BACTERIAL EXACERBATION OF CHRONIC BRONCHITIS WHEN IT IS PROBABLE THAT S PNEUMONIAE IS A CAUSATIVE PATHOGEN. S PNEUMONIAE EXHIBITS IN VITRO RESISTANCE TO LOMEFLOXACIN, AND THE SAFETY AND EFFICACY OF LOMEFLOXACIN IN THE TREATMENT OF PATIENTS WITH ACUTE BACTERIAL EXACERBATION OF CHRONIC BRONCHITIS CAUSED BY S PNEUMONIAE HAVE NOT BEEN DEMONSTRATED. IF LOMEFLOXACIN IS TO BE PRESCRIBED FOR GRAM–STAIN–GUIDED EMPIRIC THERAPY OF ACUTE BACTERIAL EXACERBATION OF CHRONIC BRONCHITIS, IT SHOULD BE USED ONLY IF SPUTUM GRAM STAIN DEMONSTRATES AN ADEQUATE QUALITY OF SPECIMEN (> 25 PMNs/LPF) AND THERE IS BOTH A PREDOMINANCE OF GRAM-NEGATIVE MICROORGANISMS AND NOT A PREDOMINANCE OF GRAM-POSITIVE MICROORGANISMS.

URINARY TRACT

Uncomplicated Urinary Tract Infections (cystitis) caused by Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, or Staphylococcus saprophyticus. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION and CLINICAL STUDIES — UNCOMPLICATED CYSTITIS .)

Complicated Urinary Tract Infections caused by Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Citrobacter diversus, or Enterobacter cloacae.

NOTE: In clinical trials with patients experiencing complicated urinary tract infections (UTIs) due to P aeruginosa, 12 of 16 patients had the microorganism eradicated from the urine after therapy with lomefloxacin. None of the patients had concomitant bacteremia. Serum levels of lomefloxacin do not reliably exceed the MIC of Pseudomonas isolates. THE SAFETY AND EFFICACY OF LOMEFLOXACIN IN TREATING PATIENTS WITH PSEUDOMONAS BACTEREMIA HAVE NOT BEEN ESTABLISHED.

Appropriate culture and susceptibility tests should be performed before antimicrobial treatment in order to isolate and identify microorganisms causing infection and to determine their susceptibility to lomefloxacin. In patients with UTIs, therapy with Maxaquin film-coated tablets may be initiated before results of these tests are known; once these results become available, appropriate therapy should be continued. In patients with an acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, therapy should not be started empirically with lomefloxacin when there is a probability the causative pathogen is S pneumoniae.

Beta-lactamase production should have no effect on lomefloxacin activity.

Question 3.3 — CRE infections outside the urinary tract that are not carbapenemase producing: For isolates that exhibit susceptibility to meropenem and imipenem (ie, MICs ≤ 1 μg/mL) but are not susceptible to ertapenem (ie, MICs ≥ 1 μg/mL), the use of extended-infusion meropenem (or imipenem-cilastatin) is suggested; if such isolates do not exhibit susceptibility to any carbapenem, ceftazidime-avibactam, meropenem-vaborbactam, and imipenem-cilastatin-relebactam are preferred treatment options. The rationale notes that less than 3% of the 1249 isolates resistant to ertapenem but susceptible to meropenem and imipenem contained a carbapenemase gene, and that standard-infusion meropenem or imipenem-cilastatin may be reasonable for uncomplicated cUTIs. For isolates susceptible to meropenem but not imipenem (and vice versa), the panel suggests basing treatment on severity of illness and site of infection. The panel suggests against the use of meropenem-vaborbactam and imipenem-cilastatin-relebactam to treat ertapenem-resistant, meropenem-susceptible and imipenem-susceptible infections, and suggests against the use of extended-infusion carbapenems with or without a second agent when susceptibility to meropenem or imipenem has not been demonstrated. Tigecycline or eravacycline are alternative options for CRE infections not involving the bloodstream or urinary tract.

### Clinical response to discordant therapy in third-generation cephalosporin-resistant UTIs [^111U3xAa]. Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To describe the initial clinical response and care escalation needs for children with urinary tract infections (UTIs) resistant to third-generation cephalosporins while on discordant antibiotics.

Methods

We performed a retrospective study of children < 18 years old presenting to an acute care setting of 5 children's hospitals and a large managed care organization from 2012 to 2017 with third-generation cephalosporin-resistant UTIs (defined as the growth of ≥ 50000 colony-forming units per mL of Escherichia coli or Klebsiella spp. nonsusceptible to ceftriaxone with a positive urinalysis). We included children started on discordant antibiotics who had follow-up when culture susceptibilities resulted. Outcomes were escalation of care (emergency department visit, hospital admission, or ICU transfer while on discordant therapy) and clinical response at follow-up (classified as improved or not improved).

Results

Of the 316 children included, 78% were girls and the median age was 2.4 years (interquartile range 0.6–6.5). Children were evaluated in the emergency department (56%) or clinic (43%), and 90% were started on a cephalosporin. A total of 7 of 316 children (2.2%; 95% confidence interval 0.8%-4.5%) experienced escalation of care. For the 230 children (73%) with clinical response recorded, 192 of 230 (83.5%; 95% confidence interval 78.0%-88.0%) experienced clinical improvement. In children with repeat urine testing while on discordant therapy, pyuria improved or resolved in 16 of 19 (84%) and urine cultures sterilized in 11 of 17 (65%).

Conclusions

Most children with third-generation cephalosporin-resistant UTIs started on discordant antibiotics experienced initial clinical improvement, and few required escalation of care. Our findings suggest that narrow-spectrum empiric therapy is appropriate while awaiting final urine culture results.

ESBL-producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E) — cefepime: The panel suggests avoiding cefepime for the treatment of pyelonephritis or cUTI and for infections outside of the urinary tract caused by ESBL-E, even if cefepime tests susceptible; however, if cefepime was started empirically for uncomplicated cystitis due to an organism later identified as ESBL-E and the patient improves, no change or extension of therapy is necessary. Rationale includes that ESBLs commonly hydrolyze cefepime, cefepime MIC testing may be inaccurate and/or poorly reproducible with commercial AST methods, clinical trials comparing cefepime with a carbapenem for ESBL-E bloodstream infections have not been conducted, and for these reasons the panel suggests avoiding cefepime for invasive ESBL-E infections.

### Sulopenem for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections including pyelonephritis: a phase 3, randomized trial [^111Uescw]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

The prevalence of infections caused by extended–spectrum β–lactamase (ESBL)–producing Enterobacterales has been increasing worldwide in both hospital- and community-acquired settings. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's analysis of data reported in 2011–2014 to the National Healthcare Safety Network revealed that the proportion of Escherichia coli resistant to extended–spectrum cephalosporins that caused hospital–acquired infections was 13.4% nationally, with rates as high as 24% in some states. That analysis also demonstrated that more than one-third of E. coli isolates in 2014 were resistant to fluoroquinolones. In 2017, ESBL-producing Enterobacterales infections occurred in 197 400 hospitalized patients in the United States, causing 9100 deaths; the estimated attributable healthcare costs for those infections that year was $1.2 billion. Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae are both important causes of complicated urinary tract infections (cUTIs) and pyelonephritis. A 2019 report by the European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Network noted that in 2018, more than half of E. coli isolates were resistant to at least 1 of the antimicrobial groups, including the aminopenicillins (57.4%), fluoroquinolones (25.3%), third–generation cephalosporins (15.1%), and aminoglycosides (11.1%). More than 30% of K. pneumoniae isolates were resistant to third-generation cephalosporins (31.7%) and fluoroquinolones (31.6%). Coresistance rates among E. coli that are resistant to either fluoroquinolones or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) have exceeded 45%.

### Pathogen-focused clinical development to address unmet medical need: cefiderocol targeting carbapenem resistance [^116Uup1J]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Historically, the regulatory requirements of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for developing new antibiotics have not addressed pathogen-focused indications for drug approval. The design of the necessary randomized controlled trials traditionally involves the enrollment of patients with site-specific infections caused by susceptible as well as resistant pathogens. Cefiderocol has undergone a streamlined clinical development program to address serious carbapenem-resistant infections. The regulatory approach, and the pivotal clinical trials, differed between the FDA and EMA. In the United States, the APEKS-cUTI (Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Stenotrophomonas-complicated urinary tract infection) study was conducted to provide the basis for FDA approval of a site-specific cUTI indication. The EMA, however, preferred the CREDIBLE-CR (A MultiCenter, RandomizED, Open-label ClInical Study of S-649266 or Best AvailabLE Therapy for the Treatment of Severe Infections Caused by Carbapenem-Resistant Gram-negative Pathogens) study, in which patients with nosocomial pneumonia, bloodstream infections, or cUTIs were enrolled if they had a carbapenem-resistant pathogen. The resulting European label will be pathogen focused rather than infection site specific (ie, treatment of gram-negative infection in patients with limited treatment options). The implications and limitations of these different regulatory processes are discussed.

### Treatment for infections with carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae: what options do we still have? [^113SwCtf]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Fosfomycin

Fosfomycin is another old broad-spectrum antibiotic that inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis and has in vitro activity against CRE. The oral formulation achieves high concentrations in the urine and is usually effective in the treatment of non-complicated UTIs. The IV formulation (fosfomycin disodium) is not available in the US and other countries, although it has been used successfully in Greece, mostly as an adjuvant drug in combination therapies. For example, a study of 11 critically ill patients with nosocomial infections caused by KPC K. pneumoniae were treated with IV fosfomycin (2 to 4 g every 6 hours) in combination with colistin (n = 6), gentamicin (n = 3), and piperacillin/tazobactam (n = 1). All patients were reported to have good treatment-related microbiological and clinical outcomes, while the all-cause hospital mortality was 18.2% (two patients). The emergence of resistance to fosfomycin during therapy for bacteremia with KPC K. pneumoniae has been reported and is especially concerning since fosfomycin was used as an adjunct in combination therapy in these cases. Recently, parenteral fosfomycin administered in combination with colistin or tigecycline was studied in a prospective observational multicenter trial in 11 ICUs in Europe. In total, 41 patients with bacteremia or ventilator-associated pneumonia caused by carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae were treated with a median dose of 24 g of fosfomycin per day for a total of 14 days. Microbiological cure was reported in 56.5% of cases, with an all-cause 28-day mortality of 43.5% and emergence of resistance in three patients.

### Cefoxitin [^113hAcb2]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Treatment

Cefoxitin for Injection, USP is indicated for the treatment of serious infections caused by susceptible strains of the designated microorganisms in the diseases listed below.

(1) Lower respiratory tract infections, including pneumonia and lung abscess, caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, other streptococci (excluding enterococci, e.g. Enterococcus faecalis [formerly Streptococcus faecalis]), Staphylococcus aureus (including penicillinase-producing strains), Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, Haemophilus influenzae, and Bacteroides species.

(2) Urinary tract infections caused by Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Proteus vulgaris and Providencia species (including P. rettgeri).

(3) Intra-abdominal infections, including peritonitis and intra-abdominal abscess, caused by Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, Bacteroides species including Bacteroides fragilis, and Clostridium species.

(4) Gynecological infections, including endometritis, pelvic cellulitis, and pelvic inflammatory disease caused by Escherichia coli, Neisseria gonorrhoeae (including penicillinase-producing strains), Bacteroides species including B. fragilis, Clostridium species, Peptococcus niger, Peptostreptococcus species and Streptococcus agalactiae. Cefoxitin for Injection, USP, like cephalosporins, has no activity against Chlamydia trachomatis. Therefore, when Cefoxitin for Injection, USP is used in the treatment of patients with pelvic inflammatory disease and C. trachomatis is one of the suspected pathogens, appropriate anti-chlamydial coverage should be added.

### Klebsiella pneumoniae liver abscess: a new invasive syndrome [^113BLx4T]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2012). Medium credibility.

Klebsiella pneumoniae is a well known human nosocomial pathogen. Most community-acquired K pneumoniae infections cause pneumonia or urinary tract infections. During the past two decades, however, a distinct invasive syndrome that causes liver abscesses has been increasingly reported in Asia, and this syndrome is emerging as a global disease. In this Review, we summarise the clinical presentation and management as well the microbiological aspects of this invasive disease. Diabetes mellitus and two specific capsular types in the bacterium predispose a patient to the development of liver abscesses and the following metastatic complications: bacteraemia, meningitis, endophthalmitis, and necrotising fasciitis. For patients with this invasive syndrome, appropriate antimicrobial treatment combined with percutaneous drainage of liver abscesses increases their chances of survival. Rapid detection of the hypervirulent strain that causes this syndrome allows earlier diagnosis and treatment, thus minimising the occurrence of sequelae and improving clinical outcomes.

The rationale notes uncertainty and diagnostic limits: "Clinical reports differ on how frequently resistance to ceftriaxone emerges", "there are no CLSI-endorsed approaches for AmpC detection in clinical isolates", and "these organisms may display ceftriaxone resistance for other reasons (eg, ESBL production)".

Uncomplicated cystitis caused by carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) — agents with expected activity and alternatives — includes nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin, which all achieve high concentrations in urine and are expected to be effective for uncomplicated CRE cystitis if the isolate is susceptible. A single dose of an aminoglycoside is an alternative option; oral fosfomycin is an alternative for uncomplicated cystitis caused by Escherichia coli, including if carbapenem resistant; and colistin is an alternative agent that converts to its active form in the urinary tract. Treatment suggestions for CRE infections listed below assume that in vitro activity of preferred and alternative antibiotics has been demonstrated.

### Ceftazidime-avibactam versus doripenem for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections, including acute pyelonephritis: RECAPTURE, a phase 3 randomized trial program [^116EwwHC]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a substantial cause of global morbidity, mortality, and healthcare expenditure. UTIs are considered complicated (cUTI) when associated with acute pyelonephritis, chronic urinary retention in men, or obstruction, urinary catheters, recent urinary instrumentation, or urologic abnormalities. The gram-negative bacteria frequently implicated in cUTI, including various Enterobacteriaceae (particularly Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, often harbor multidrug resistance mechanisms (particularly extended-spectrum β-lactamases [ESBLs]) that limit the effectiveness of antibiotics previously considered first-line treatments. The risks of initial antimicrobial therapy failure, which include increased mortality, are thus driving ever-increasing reliance on carbapenems. The global emergence of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa is undermining the effectiveness of the carbapenems, and highlights the urgent need for new antimicrobial treatments.

Ceftazidime-avibactam combines ceftazidime and avibactam, a first-in-class non–β-lactam β-lactamase inhibitor which restores the in vitro activity of ceftazidime against Ambler class A (eg, ESBL and K. pneumoniae carbapenemase), class C (eg, AmpC), and some class D β-lactamase–producing bacteria; it is not active against metallo-β-lactamases. Ceftazidime-avibactam (2000 mg/500 mg every 8 hours) was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) based on phase 2 data (including a phase 2 cUTI trial [NCT00690378] evaluating efficacy and safety of ceftazidime-avibactam 500 mg/125 mg every 8 hours) for the treatment of cUTI, including acute pyelonephritis, and complicated intra-abdominal infections (in combination with metronidazole) in adults with limited/no alternative treatment options. Approval of ceftazidime-avibactam has also been granted by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) based on additional data from the phase 3 RECAPTURE program, which evaluated the efficacy and safety of ceftazidime-avibactam (2000 mg/500 mg every 8 hours) in patients with cUTI including acute pyelonephritis.

### Guidelines for complicated urinary tract infections in children: a review by the European society for pediatric infectious diseases [^1155TKup]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Several studies support home IV treatment through well-resourced hospital-in-the-home programs if children are stable,– including neonates. In deciding between initial IV or oral antibiotics, the concept of complicated UTI being on a spectrum may be useful. Apart from children with sepsis, the majority with a single complicating feature are initially managed orally. Increasing the number of complicating features increases IV use, so they could be combined into a clinical score with a threshold for using IV. Outside of severe presentation, severe uropathy and neonates, clinically stable children with isolated complicating features can initially be treated with oral antibiotics.

Empiric Antibiotic Choice

Regarding empiric antibiotic choice (1) different cUTI subgroups have different uropathogen prevalence and (2) an individualized risk assessment for resistance is needed based on the child's underlying condition, prior antibiotic use and hospitalization. Based on these, an empiric regimen can be chosen that covers likely pathogens and incorporates the likelihood of resistance (GRADES C and D).
Patients with recurrent infections may initially be treated based on previous cultures (GRADE D).
For children on antibiotic prophylaxis, a different antibiotic choice is needed (GRADE C).
Targeted de-escalated monotherapy is recommended according to susceptibilities once available (GRADE D).

Each cUTI subgroup is vulnerable to different pathogens, and assessment for unusual and multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria is crucial. Risk factors for ESBL-producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E) include recurrent UTI, VUR, recent antibiotic exposure, young age and Klebsiella spp. – Risk factors for more resistant carbapenemase-producing uropathogens are prolonged hospitalization, invasive devices and recent travel to endemic areas. – Empiric antibiotic choice needs to balance the risk of resistance with the need for antimicrobial stewardship for this common infection, potentially accepting a short delay in definitive treatment for children who are hemodynamically stable.

### Resistance profiles of urinary tract infections in general practice – an observational study [^116gqoyM]. BMC Urology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Guideline recommendations on therapy in urinary tract infections are based on antibiotic resistance rates. Due to a lack of surveillance data, little is known about resistance rates in uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI) in general practice in Germany. In a prospective observational study, urine cultures of all women presenting with urinary tract infections in general practice were analysed. Resistance rates against antibiotics recommended in German guidelines on UTI are presented.

Methods

In a prospective, multi-center observational study general practitioner included all female patients ≥ 18 years with clinically suspected urinary tract infection. Only patients receiving an antibiotic therapy within the last two weeks were excluded.

Results

40 practices recruited 191 female patients (mean age 52 years; range 18–96) with urinary tract infections. Main causative agent was Escherichia coli (79%) followed by Enterococcus faecalis (14%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (7.3%).

Susceptibiliy of E.coli as the main causative agent was highest against fosfomycin and nitrofurantoin, with low resistance rates of 4,5%; 2,2%. In 17,5%, E.coli was resistant to trimethoprim and in 8,5% to ciprofloxacin.

Conclusions

Resistance rates of uropathogens from unselected patients in general practice differ from routinely collected laboratory data. These results can have an impact on antibiotic prescribing and treatment recommendations.

### Treatment strategy for a multidrug-resistant Klebsiella UTI [^112sCToH]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe the management strategy for a multidrug-resistant (MDR) Klebsiella urinary tract infection (UTI).

Case Summary

A 69-year-old Caucasian woman with a past medical history of recurrent UTIs and a right-lung transplant presented with fever to 101.4°F, chills, malaise, and cloudy, foul-smelling urine for approximately 1 week. She was found to have a MDR Klebsiella UTI that was sensitive to tigecycline and cefepime. To further evaluate the degree of resistance Etest minimum inhibitory concentrations were requested for cefepime, amikacin, meropenem, and ertapenem. The patient received a 14-day course of amikacin, which resulted in resolution of her symptoms. One month later, the patient's UTI symptoms returned. The urine culture again grew MDR Klebsiella, sensitive only to tigecycline. Fosfomycin was initiated and resulted in limited resolution of her symptoms. Colistin was started, however, therapy was discontinued on day 5 secondary to the development of acute kidney injury. Despite the short course of therapy, the patient's symptoms resolved.

Discussion

The case presented lends itself well to numerous discussion items that are important to consider when determining optimal treatment for MDR Gram-negative bacilli (GNBs). Susceptibility testing is an important tool for optimizing antibiotic therapy, however, automated systems may overestimate the susceptibility profile for a MDR GNB. Treatment strategies evaluated to treat MDR GNB, include combination therapy with a carbepenem and synergy using polymyxin.

Conclusion

We have described the management strategy for a MDR Klebsiella UTI, the consequences of the initial management strategy, and potential strategies to manage these types of infections in future patients.

AVYCAZ (ceftazidime and avibactam) is indicated for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI) including pyelonephritis in adult and pediatric patients (at least 31 weeks gestational age) caused by the following susceptible gram-negative microorganisms: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii complex, Proteus mirabilis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

1.3 Hospital-acquired Bacterial Pneumonia and Ventilator-associated Bacterial Pneumonia (HABP/VABP)

AVYCAZ (ceftazidime and avibactam) is indicated for the treatment of hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia and ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia (HABP/VABP) in adult and pediatric patients (at least 31 weeks gestational age) caused by the following susceptible gram-negative microorganisms: Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Haemophilus influenzae.

1.000000000000000e+00 4 Usage

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of AVYCAZ and other antibacterial drugs, AVYCAZ should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

### Klebsiella pneumoniae in healthcare settings… [^114MAVrC]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

General Information Klebsiella is a type of gram-negative bacteria that can cause different types of healthcare-associated infections, including pneumonia, bloodstream infections, wound or surgical site infections, and meningitis. Increasingly, Klebsiella bacteria have developed antimicrobial resistance, most recently to the class of antibiotics known as carbapenems. To prevent the spread of infections, patients also should clean their hands very often, including:

- Before preparing or eating food
- Before touching their eyes, nose, or mouth
- Before and after changing wound dressings or bandages
- After using the restroom
- After blowing their nose, coughing, or sneezing
- After touching hospital surfaces such as bed rails, bedside tables, doorknobs, remote controls, or the phone. Drug-resistant Klebsiella Some Klebsiella bacteria have become highly resistant to antibiotics.

When bacteria such as Klebsiella pneumoniae produce an enzyme known as a carbapenemase, then the class of antibiotics called carbapenems will not work to kill the bacteria and treat the infection. Klebsiella species are examples of Enterobacterales, a normal part of the human gut bacteria, that can become carbapenem-resistant. CRE, which stands for carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales, are an order of germs that are difficult to treat because they have high levels of resistance to antibiotics. Unfortunately, carbapenem antibiotics often are the last line of defense against Gram-negative infections that are resistant to other antibiotics. Treating Klebsiella infections Klebsiella infections that are not drug-resistant can be treated with antibiotics. Infections caused by KPC-producing bacteria can be difficult to treat because fewer antibiotics are effective against them.

In such cases, a microbiology laboratory must run tests to determine which antibiotics will treat the infection. What should patients do if they have been diagnosed with a Klebsiella–related illness. They must follow the treatment regimen prescribed by the healthcare provider. If the healthcare provider prescribes an antibiotic, patients must take it exactly as the healthcare provider instructs. Patients must complete the prescribed course of medication, even if symptoms are gone. If treatment stops too soon, some bacteria may survive and the patient may become re-infected. Patients must wash their hands as often as possible and follow all other hygiene recommendations.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America 2023 guidance on the treatment of antimicrobial resistant Gram-Negative infections [^115rp3Xo]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Question 1.3 — Infections outside of the urinary tract caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase–producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E): A carbapenem is recommended as first-line treatment, and meropenem, imipenem-cilastatin, or ertapenem are preferred; for patients who are critically ill and/or experiencing hypoalbuminemia, meropenem or imipenem-cilastatin are the preferred carbapenems, and after appropriate clinical response is achieved, transitioning to oral TMP-SMX, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin should be considered, if susceptibility is demonstrated. The panel suggests the use of meropenem or imipenem-cilastatin, rather than ertapenem, as initial therapy in critically ill patients with ESBL-E infections. Ertapenem offers a more convenient option for outpatient continuation when oral options are not available, and dosing is 1 g every 24 hours. In hypoalbuminemia, an observational study of 279 patients with Enterobacterales infections found that hypoalbuminemia (defined as serum albumin < 2.5 g/dL) was associated with an approximately 5-times higher odds of 30-day mortality for patients receiving ertapenem compared to those receiving meropenem or imipenem-cilastatin. A randomized trial in ceftriaxone non-susceptible E. coli or K. pneumoniae (87% later confirmed to have ESBL genes) compared piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 g IV every 6 hours with meropenem 1 g IV every 8 hours as standard infusions over 30 minutes, and the primary outcome of 30-day mortality occurred in 12% and 4% of patients receiving piperacillin-tazobactam and meropenem, respectively; trial data were subsequently reanalyzed only including patients with isolates where piperacillin-tazobactam MICs were ≤ 16 μg/mL by broth microdilution.
