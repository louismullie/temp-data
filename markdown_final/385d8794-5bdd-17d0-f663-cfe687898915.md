## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how much a 5-mile taxi ride costs when the fare is $1.50 plus $0.25 per mile. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the fixed base fare. Then, I should calculate the variable mileage cost. Next, I will add them together to get the total. Finally, I will double-check the arithmetic and match the result to the provided options.

> Let me first confirm the fixed component: the base fare is $1.50 regardless of distance, so that stays constant for any trip length, including 5 miles.

> Now, I need to calculate the variable mileage cost. At $0.25 per mile, for 5 miles that would be 5 times $0.25, which equals $1.25. Wait, let me verify that multiplication: 5 × 0.25 is indeed 1.25, so the mileage charge is $1.25.

> Next, I should add the base fare and the mileage charge to get the total cost. $1.50 plus $1.25 equals $2.75. Hold on, I should double-check the addition: 1.50 + 1.25 is 2.75, so the total fare is $2.75.

> Finally, I will match this to the answer choices. The options are 2.25, 2.50, 2.75, 3.00, and 3.75, so $2.75 corresponds to choice C.

The total cost of a 5-mile taxi ride is **$2.75**. This is calculated by adding the base fare of $1.50 to the mileage charge of $0.25 per mile × 5 miles = $1.25, for a total of $1.50 + $1.25 = **$2.75**.

---

## Calculation breakdown

| **Component** | **Cost** |
|-|-|
| Base fare | $1.50 |
| Mileage charge (5 miles × $0.25/mile) | $1.25 |
| Total cost | $2.75 |

---

Therefore, the correct answer is **C. $2.75**.

### Transportation costs impede sustained adherence and access to HAART in a clinic population in southwestern Uganda: a qualitative study [^ae1de51d]. AIDS and Behavior (2010). Low credibility.

Results

Forty-one participants — 25 women and 16 men — were interviewed for the study. They ranged in age from 24 to 57, with a mean age of 37 for the women and 40 for the men. Twenty-three of the participants were from rural areas, six from urban areas, and 12 from peri-urban areas. Gardening and farming were the most frequent occupations. Thirty reported being on a HAART regimen for a period of time ranging from one month to several years, although many could not remember specifically when they started. Eleven had not yet initiated HAART. Of those already on HAART, 13 participants acknowledged having missed one or more doses of their ARVs since they started treatment. The remainder said they had never missed a dose.

All participants were asked about how they traveled to the clinic and how they found the money to cover transportation costs. None reported walking to the clinic on a routine basis. For five participants who lived within a few miles, the clinic was a short ride on a bus or motor-scooter-taxi, known as a boda–boda, with a round-trip fare usually costing from $0.60 to $1.50 (about 1,000–2,500 Ugandan shillings at the exchange rate during September 2007, which was approximately $1–1,700 Ugandan shillings). The other 36 participants lived farther from the clinic — some up to several hours away by car or public transportation — and generally reported that the round-trip fare for their monthly clinic visits was between about $1.75 and $11.75. The higher cost represents almost half of the mean per capita annual income in Uganda of $300, or $25 a month (Uganda Country Profile).

### How much does it cost to care for survivors of colorectal cancer? Caregiver's time, travel and out-of-pocket costs [^8ce26bc7]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

Costing informal care

All costs were valued in 2008 Euro. Costs were categorised by phase of care and type of activity (hospital- or domestic-related). Ongoing care costs were adjusted for inflation using the Irish Consumer Price Index. We recorded a zero cost for blanks left by respondents who reported some cost for any of the cost components in a given section.

OOP costs (excluding travel) were collected for a typical week in each phase. Valuation of travel costs (excluding time) was based on mode of transport used and number of journeys. For car users, we derived costs from miles travelled multiplied by average cost per mile for 2009 (the closet year to the base cost year for which estimates were available), assuming average car use of 10,000 miles/year and tax band C. This cost includes fixed (e.g. insurance, depreciation) and variable components (e.g. petrol, tyres, servicing and repairs). For carers using public transport, we applied the cost for a day return ticket for the journey as reported by provider websites (Bus Éireann, Irish Rail and Dublin Bus). For taxis, cost was apportioned using an official fare calculator and the reported distance travelled. Walkers, cyclists and users of hospital minibuses were assumed to incur zero travel costs.

### Incentive-driven transition to high ride-sharing adoption [^147441a9]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Sustainable mobility – is essential for ensuring socially, economically, and environmentally viable urban life. Ride-sharing (sometimes also referred to as ride-pooling) constitutes a promising alternative to individual motorized transport by private cars or single-occupant taxi cabs, currently dominating urban mobility. In ride-sharing, one vehicle transports multiple passengers simultaneously by combining two or more trip requests with similar origin and destination. In contrast to analog on-street hailing of taxi rides, digital app-based ride-hailing services are especially suited to implement ride-sharing due to easy access to the information required to match different trips.

By combining different individual trips into a shared ride, ride-sharing increases the average utilization per vehicle, reduces the total number of vehicles required to serve the same demandand thereby mitigates congestion and negative environmental impacts of urban mobility. Hence, encouraging ride-sharing for trips that would otherwise be conducted in a single-occupancy motorized vehicle is preferable from a systemic perspective –.

### Impact on direct and indirect costs of switching patients with inflammatory bowel disease from intravenous to subcutaneous infliximab (CT-P13) [^62e3ffda]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Materials and methods

We recently instigated a switch programme of patients established on intravenous biologics to SC formulations where available. All adult patients with IBD undergoing treatment with the Infliximab biosimilar CT-P13 at Leeds Teaching Hospitals Trust, UK were identified from local hospital records. Demographics, disease-specific data and distance between residence and our infusion unit were extracted for each patient from the electronic hospital records. Patients were considered eligible to switch from intravenous to SC CT-P13 if they were on a standard dosing regimen, that is, 5 mg/kg every 8 weeks. Patients were invited to switch via written letter from the lead IBD clinician and subsequent discussion with the IBD nurses at their next CT-P13 infusion. Patients were classified as intravenous or SC based on their decision to switch within 3 months.

Annual costs were calculated by summating the direct and indirect costs. Figure 1 demonstrates how these costs were calculated. For direct costs, we used average number of infusions (6.5) or injections (26) per year. Medication costs were based on National Health Service (NHS) agreed pricing. The cost of a visit to the infusion unit cost was £325 per patient per visit as per locally agreed costs. There is variation in the costs of day unit infusion visits and we, therefore, performed a sensitivity analysis for a lower price of £249 and a highest price of £389 to allow comparison of costs which may apply to other UK units. For indirect costs, travel data were extrapolated from locally collected survey data from 50 responders. The 50 responders provided information on mode of transport, employment status, parking costs and time spent on travel and at the infusion unit. We then extrapolated the 50 responses to the full cohort. Indirect costs were calculated using average UK wage per hour (£13.57), advisory fuel rate per mile, hospital carparking prices, local return bus ticket pricesand local taxi prices for the mean journey.

### Analysis of travel burden and travel support among patients treated at a comprehensive cancer center in the southeastern United States [^6d86fd30]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Travel burden leads to worse cancer outcomes. Understanding travel burden and the level and types of travel support provided at large cancer centers is critical for developing systematic programs to alleviate travel burden. This study analyzed patients who received travel assistance, including their travel burden, types and amount of travel support received, and factors that influenced these outcomes.

Methods

We analyzed 1063 patients who received travel support from 1/1/2021 to 5/1/2023 at Winship Cancer Institute, in which~18,000 patients received cancer care annually. Travel burden was measured using distance and time to Winship sites from patients' residential address. Travel support was evaluated using the monetary value of total travel support and type of support received. Patients' sociodemographic and clinical factors were extracted from electronic medical records. Area-level socioeconomic disadvantage was coded by the Area Deprivation Index using patient ZIP codes.

Results

On average, patients traveled 57.2 miles and 67.3 min for care and received $74.1 in total for travel support. Most patients (88.3%) received travel-related funds (e.g., gas cards), 5% received direct rides (e.g. Uber), 3.8% received vouchers for taxi or public transportation, and 3% received combined travel support. Male and White had longer travel distance and higher travel time than female and other races, respectively. Patients residing in more disadvantaged neighborhoods had an increased travel distance and travel time. Other races and Hispanics received more travel support ($) than Black and White patients or non-Hispanics. Patients with higher travel distance and travel time were more like to receive travel-related financial support.

Conclusion

Among patients who received travel support, those from socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods had greater travel burden. Patients with greater travel burden were more likely to receive travel funds versus other types of support. Further understanding of the impact of travel burden and travel support on cancer outcomes is needed.

### Leveraging transportation providers to deploy lay first responder (LFR) programs in three sub-saharan African countries without formal emergency medical services: evaluating longitudinal impact and cost-effectiveness [^441f5660]. Injury (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In 2019, the World Health Assembly declared emergency care essential to achieve the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals. Few sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries have developed robust approaches to sustainably deliver emergency medical services (EMS) at scale, as high-income country models are financially impractical. Innovative reassessment of EMS delivery in resource-limited settings is necessary as timely emergency care access can substantially reduce mortality.

Materials and Methods

We developed the Lay First Responder (LFR) program by training 1,291 pre-existing motorcycle taxi drivers, a predominant form of short-distance transport in sub-Saharan Africa, to provide trauma care and transport for road traffic injuries. Three pilot programs were launched in staggered fashion between 2016 and 2019 in West, Central, and East Africa and a 5.5 h curriculum was iteratively developed to train first responders. Longitudinal data on patient impact (patient demographics, injury characteristics, and treatment rendered), emergency care knowledge acquisition/retention, and social/financial effects of LFR training were collected and pooled across three sites for collective analysis. Novel cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated based on prospective cost data from each site. Previously projected aggregate disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) addressable by LFRs were used to inform cost-effectiveness ratios($USD cost per DALY averted). Cost-effectiveness ratios were then compared against African per capita gross domestic product (GDP), following WHOCHOICE guidelines, which state ratios less than GDP per capita are "very cost-effective".

Results

In 2,171 total patient encounters across all three pilot sites, LFRs most frequently provided hemorrhage control in 61% of patient encounters and patient transport by motorcycle in 98.5%. Median pre-/post-test scores improved by 34.1 percentage points (39.5% vs.73.6%, p < 0.0001) with significant knowledge retention at six months. 75% of initial participants remain voluntarily involved 3 years post-course, reporting increased local stature and customer acquisition(income 32.0% greater than non-trained counterparts). Locally sourced first-aid materials cost $6.54USD/participant. Cost-effectiveness analysis demonstrated cost per DALY averted = $51.65USD.

Conclusion

LFR training is highly cost-effective according to WHOCHOICE guidelines and expands emergency care access. The LFR program may be an alternative approach to formal ambulance-reliant EMS that are cost-prohibitive in resource-limited, sub-Saharan African settings. A novel social/financial mechanism appears to incentivize long-term voluntary LFR involvement, which may sustain programs in resource-limited settings.

### Impacts of shared mobility on vehicle lifetimes and on the carbon footprint of electric vehicles [^ea6e58e3]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Decarbonizing road transportation is an important step in achieving the Paris Agreement, with battery electric vehicles (BEVs) being one of the main strategies considered. Transitioning towards a fully electrified passenger car fleet effectively eliminates tailpipe carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions and has the potential to significantly reduce lifecycle CO 2 emissions. Nevertheless, social and environmental sustainability concerns have been raised related to battery manufacturing and the mining of raw materials.

Pathways with low resource exploitation and high energy efficiency are beneficial for decarbonization since they reduce the overall energy demand and material requirements. Options for passenger cars include various on-demand mobility schemes (including ride sourcing and ride sharing) that could replace individual passenger car ownership –. Implementing such schemes on a large scale would probably depend on self-driving (autonomous) vehicles. Autonomous vehicles could decrease costs and increase the convenience of such schemes thus rendering it preferable over individually owned cars (including other arrangements where the car is primarily used by one household).

Car sharing and ride sharing could increase resource efficiency and reduce the environmental load of the system by replacing on the order of ten individually owned cars per shared car. At the same time, the shared cars will likely be used more intensively during their lifetimes as compared to individually owned cars. Moreover, shared autonomous vehicles may travel around without passengers for a large extent of their cumulative lifetime distance (so called "empty travel" or "deadhead travel"), which could lead to faster vehicle fleet turnover and increased manufacturing-phase emissions. Simulation studies of shared autonomous vehicles have found that empty travel could increase the total vehicle travel distance by 10 to 100% in urban areas compared to the intended travel distance (i.e. the distance traveled by the car to transport a passenger or a group of passenger from one point to another). Empirical studies show a level of around 60% for taxi ridesand 40% for ride-sourcing services, on top of the intended (or served) travel distance.

### Estimated total costs from non-fatal and fatal bicycle crashes in the USA: 1997–2013 [^0d5a31d3]. Injury Prevention (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Emergency department visits and hospital admissions resulting from adult bicycle trauma have increased dramatically. Annual medical costs and work losses of these incidents last were estimated for 2005 and quality-of-life losses for 2000.

Methods

We estimated costs associated with adult bicycle injuries in the USA using 1997–2013 non-fatal incidence data from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System with cost estimates from the Consumer Product Safety Commission's Injury Cost Model, and 1999–2013 fatal incidence data from the National Vital Statistics System costed by similar methods.

Results

Approximately 3.8 million non-fatal adult bicycle injuries were reported during the study period and 9839 deaths. In 2010 dollars, estimated adult bicycle injury costs totalled $24.4 billion in 2013. Estimated injury costs per mile bicycled fell from $2.85 in 2001 to $2.35 in 2009. From 1999 to 2013, total estimated costs were $209 billion due to non-fatal bicycle injuries and $28 billion due to fatal injuries. Inflation-free annual costs in the study period increased by 137% for non-fatal injuries and 23% for fatal injuries. The share of non-fatal costs associated with injuries to riders age 45 and older increased by 1.6% (95% CI 1.4% to 1.9%) annually. The proportion of costs due to incidents that occurred on a street or highway steadily increased by 0.8% (95% CI 0.4% to 1.3%) annually.

Conclusions

Inflation-free costs per case associated with non-fatal bicycle injuries are increasing. The growth in costs is especially associated with rising ridership, riders 45 and older, and street/highway crashes.

### CDC recommendations for improving health through transportation policy [^305b8862]. CDC (2010). Medium credibility.

CDC recommendations — expand public transportation state that public transportation systems reduce the necessity for single occupancy vehicle trips, reduce the production of automobile emissions, increase incidental physical activity, and provide necessary transportation access for people with physical, economic, or other limitations that impede their access to and use of a single occupancy motor vehicle. Recommendations include to 'Explore opportunities to increase funding to strengthen the positive health impacts associated with expanded public transportation options' with actions such as 'Encourage funding decisions that strengthen public transportation', 'Encourage states to increase investments in public transportation, congestion relief, air quality improvements, and other options, and to remove barriers to use of gas tax revenues for public transportation and bicycle-pedestrian improvements', 'Give state, regional, and local governments more flexibility to choose from transportation funding categories to meet local transportation needs', 'Explore the extent to which program requirements and resources can be made to be more comparable for public transportation, highways, non-motorized and rail travel alternatives to encourage investments in all modes of transportation', and 'Provide incentives to support a strong network of public transportation options, including bus rapid transit and light rail, which connect housing and jobs as well as improve access to healthy foods, medical care, and other services'.

### Cost-effectiveness of raising alcohol excise taxes to reduce the injury burden of road traffic crashes [^be262af0]. Injury Prevention (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Alcohol is an important risk factor for road transport injuries. We aimed to determine if raising alcohol taxes would be a cost-effective intervention strategy for reducing this burden.

Methods

We modelled the effect of a one-off increase in alcohol excise tax (NZ$0.15 (US$0.10)/standard drink) on alcohol consumption in New Zealand, using price elasticities to determine change in on-trade and off-trade sales of beer, cider, wine, spirits and ready-to-drink products. We simulated change in alcohol-attributable motor vehicle and motorcycle injuries, by age, sex and ethnicity, over the lifetime of the current population, and from changes in injuries, we determined changes in costs of health care, productivity, crime and vehicle damage.

Results

The modelled increase in tax led to a net 4.3% reduction in pure alcohol consumption and a 27% increase in excise tax revenue. Lifetime population health improved by 640 quality-adjusted life years (95% uncertainty interval: 450 to 860) and costs of treating transport injuries reduced by NZ$3.6 million ($0.88 million to $6.8 million), although this was countered by a $3.8 million ($2.9 million to $4.8 million) increase in costs of treating other diseases. Health care costs were far outweighed by a $240 million ($130 to $370 million) reduction in lost productivity, crime and vehicle damage costs. Cost-effectiveness was not highly sensitive to price elasticity values, discount rates or time horizons for measurement of outcomes.

Conclusion

Raising alcohol excise tax in this high-income country would be highly cost-effective and could lead to substantial cost-savings for society.

### Implementation of a non-emergent medical transportation programme at an integrated health system [^e5451bc6]. BMJ Health & Care Informatics (2021). High credibility.

Evaluation

Kaizen Health provided 6195 rides from 3633 patients in 2020 (figure 1A). NEMT patients tended to be young, to self-identify as black, and to reside in zip codes with high Area Deprivation Indices (online supplemental table 3).

Figure 1
(A) Shows cumulative ride use over time across different sites within our system. (B) Shows site-specific individual ride distances (grey points) and their overall distribution (violin plots). BJH, Barnes Jewish Hospital; SLCH, St. Louis Children's Hospital; CH, Christian Hospital.

Most rides (5545, 88%) were rideshares and almost two-thirds (4188, 66%) were for hospital discharge (online supplemental table 4). In general, rides were short (median distance 5.4 miles (IQR 3.2–10.0 miles), although 142 rides (2.3%) exceeded 50 miles (figure 1B). For just-in-time calls, waits were typically under 10 min. By contrast, social workers reported waits of 30 min to several hours prior to our NEMT update. Compared with taxicab voucher outlay in 2019, the Kaizen Health NEMT programme incurred approximately US$114 000 lower costs in 2020.

We surveyed workers arranging transportation. Of 153 workers approached, 44 (29%) responded. Respondents characterised the new platform as easier to use (n = 34, 77%), as fast or faster for scheduling (n = 39, 91%) and as fast or faster for ride arrival (n = 40, 93%) than prior NEMT experiences. Informal shadowing and patient anecdotes provided by staff suggested that patient experience was improved by decreased wait times and fewer cancellations.

### CDC yellow book 2026: health information for international travel. chapter 3 environmental hazards and risks [^a61654c8]. CDC (2025). High credibility.

Road traffic injuries — each year globally, road traffic crashes result in approximately 1.3 million deaths and 20 to 50 million injuries, and they are the leading cause of death for children and young adults aged 5–29 years. From 2019 through 2021, among the 402 US citizen road traffic deaths abroad, 62% were among drivers and occupants of passenger vehicles and 19% involved motorcycles, with the most deaths in Mexico (141 deaths; 35%), the Dominican Republic (21 deaths; 5%), and Ecuador and Vietnam (each with 16 deaths; 4%). Other risk factors include vehicle speed, lack of familiarity with the roads, driving on the opposite side of the road, the influence of alcohol and other drugs, poorly made or inadequately maintained vehicles, travel fatigue, poor road surfaces without shoulders, unprotected curves and cliffs, and low or absent lighting creating conditions of poor visibility. Travelers should always use seat belts (including in rear seats) and child safety seats and should rent vehicles with seat belts; whenever possible, travelers should ride only in taxis with seat belts and opt for the rear seats. Discourage travelers from driving or riding on motorcycles or motorbikes, including motorcycle and motorbike taxis; for travelers who cannot be dissuaded, strongly recommend that they wear a helmet that meets US safety standards. A good-quality helmet can reduce the risk for death by 40% and for severe injury by 70%. The Department of State has useful safety information for international travelers, including road safety and security alerts, international driving permits, and travel insurance.

### Injury and death during travel | Yellow book… [^8a095021]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Travel destinations might lack emergency care that approximates U. S. standards; trauma centers capable of providing care for serious injuries are uncommon outside urban areas. Make travelers aware of their increased risk for injuries when traveling or residing internationally, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, and to take preventive steps to reduce the chances of serious injury. 2Excludes deaths not reported to the U. S. embassy or consulate. 3Motor vehicle includes deaths classified as "vehicle accidents, " including the following subcategories: auto, bus, motorcycle, pedestrian, train, and other. 4All other includes deaths classified as armed conflict, other accident, and undetermined/unknown. Road traffic injuries Each year globally, road traffic crashes involving bicycles, buses, cars, motorcycles, trucks, or pedestrians result in approximately 1. 3 million deaths and 20 to 50 million injuries.

They are a major cause of death among all age groups and the leading cause of death for children and young adults aged 5–29 years. From 2019 through 2021, among the 402 U. S. citizen road traffic deaths abroad, 62% were among drivers and occupants of passenger vehicles, and 19% involved motorcycles. The countries with the most U. S. citizen road traffic deaths were Mexico, the Dominican Republic, and Ecuador and Vietnam. Risk factors for vehicular crashes, injuries, and deaths include vehicles that fail to meet basic safety standards; roads shared by motor vehicles and vulnerable users; and the mix of traffic, including animals, bicycles, buses, cars, rickshaws, taxis, and large trucks.

Other risk factors include vehicle speed, lack of familiarity with the roads, driving on the opposite side of the road, the influence of alcohol and other drugs, poorly made or inadequately maintained vehicles, travel fatigue, poor road surfaces without shoulders, unprotected curves and cliffs, and low or absent lighting creating conditions of poor visibility. Travelers should always use seat belts and child safety seats and should rent vehicles with seat belts. Whenever possible, travelers should ride only in taxis with seat belts and opt for the rear seats. Travelers also should bring car seats or booster seats for their children from home unless they can be assured of their availability and quality at the destination.

### Measuring the costs of outreach motivational interviewing for smoking cessation and relapse prevention among low-income pregnant women [^8c346400]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2009). Low credibility.

Variable program costs

- MI Scheduling - 17 minutes on average; @ $0.52/minute = $8.8 per intervention session or $26.5 per participant

- MI Preparation - 11 minutes on average; @ $0.52/minute = $5.7 per intervention session or $17.2 per participant

- MI Delivery - 66 minutes on average; @ $0.52/minute = $34.3 per session or $103 per participant

- Travel to and from the intervention delivery site - 40 minutes on average; @ $0.52/minute = $20.8 per visit or $62.4 per participant

- Participant time spent in MI - 66 minutes on average; @ a minimum wage of $5.15 per hour = $17.0 per participant

- Transportation to and from the MI delivery site for mileage (29 miles) @$0.25 per mile = $21.8 per participant

- Printed self-help materials (7 items for the MI group and 2 for UC group) = $4.7 (MI) per participant and $1.8 (UC) per participant, a difference of $2.90 per MI participant

- Cost of analyzing a nicotine sample - $17 per sample = $34 per participant (2 samples analyzed)

The total cost of $311.8 per participant for MI intervention compared with a cost of $4.82 per participant for usual care, a difference of $307 ([CI], $289.2 to $322.8) (Table 4). Using the expected fixed cost ($3,930) and variable cost per participant ($287) as a guide, one is then able to estimate the cost of providing MI to greater or lesser numbers of participants. For example, the total expected program costs for delivering MI to 500 participants (Fixed cost + 500 * Variable cost) would be $3,930 + 500 * 287 or $147,430. This assumes no economies of scale in delivering the program such that fixed costs will decrease in the long run.

### Addressing the minimum fleet problem in on-demand urban mobility [^a2b962b8]. Nature (2018). Excellent credibility.

Information and communication technologies have opened the way to new solutions for urban mobility that provide better ways to match individuals with on-demand vehicles. However, a fundamental unsolved problem is how best to size and operate a fleet of vehicles, given a certain demand for personal mobility. Previous studies 1–5 either do not provide a scalable solution or require changes in human attitudes towards mobility. Here we provide a network-based solution to the following 'minimum fleet problem', given a collection of trips (specified by origin, destination and start time), of how to determine the minimum number of vehicles needed to serve all the trips without incurring any delay to the passengers. By introducing the notion of a 'vehicle-sharing network', we present an optimal computationally efficient solution to the problem, as well as a nearly optimal solution amenable to real-time implementation. We test both solutions on a dataset of 150 million taxi trips taken in the city of New York over one year 6. The real-time implementation of the method with near-optimal service levels allows a 30 per cent reduction in fleet size compared to current taxi operation. Although constraints on driver availability and the existence of abnormal trip demands may lead to a relatively larger optimal value for the fleet size than that predicted here, the fleet size remains robust for a wide range of variations in historical trip demand. These predicted reductions in fleet size follow directly from a reorganization of taxi dispatching that could be implemented with a simple urban app; they do not assume ride sharing 7–9, nor require changes to regulations, business models, or human attitudes towards mobility to become effective. Our results could become even more relevant in the years ahead as fleets of networked, self-driving cars become commonplace 10–14.

### Cost effectiveness of preventing falls and improving mobility in people with parkinson disease: protocol for an economic evaluation alongside a clinical trial [^b8eda40f]. BMC Geriatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Cost data

A questionnaire administered to facility managers will quantify the resource requirements, including staff costs, rent for space and large capital items, overheads and consumables. Market prices and relevant depreciation rates will be used to determine other capital and equipment costs. Sensitivity analysis will be used to vary labour costs using the award wage rate plus on-costs for superannuation and leave loading, and market fee-for-service charges for the relevant health professional category.

A questionnaire, to be administered at each therapy session, has been designed to capture information on any injuries or health issues and associated healthcare utilisation arising as a direct result of the therapy sessions. Personal costs borne by the individual in accessing the intervention including time, distance and mode of transport are also included. Costs of each mode of transport will be estimated using standard taxi charges, the price of public transport, and a cost per kilometre for a private car.

Data collected through the falls calendar and falls hotline will be used to quantify fall-related health care service utilization. Valuing or costing health service utilization will be done using a number of methods. Where patients attend a hospital in our Southern Health region (which includes hospital facilities participating in the study), we will collect patient-level costing and utilization data for inpatient services from the hospital's computerized costing and admission discharge systems. This data can then be used to model costs for patients where patient-level data is not available, such as if they attend a hospital outside the Southern Health region. In this case length of stay will be used as the main parameter. Costs will be attributed to these services based on published costing data from the National Hospital Cost Data Collection, Commonwealth Medical Benefits Schedule (CMBS), and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS). This approach can be reconciled with a Diagnosis Related Group (DRG) costing approach. CMBS rates will be used to cost medical and diagnostic imaging services, PBS for pharmaceuticals and award wages for other health professionals.

Cost effectiveness analysis

The benefit of economic evaluation is that it captures both benefits and costs of an intervention in one comparable unit – a cost-effectiveness ratio. In this evaluation economic analysis will be three-way, first comparing each intervention with the control group, and then comparing the interventions with each other. The three-way analysis of the cost effectiveness ratios is shown in Table 1.

To determine the base cost (sum of pickup fee, trip fee, and surcharges) of a trip we first compute the trip fee based on the price per mile, price per minute, and the estimated trip length and duration. We add the pickup fee obtained from the Uber products API. Since data on the surcharges (e.g. airport fees or tolls) of individual trips is not available, we take surcharges to be constant for each trip. We subtract the pickup fee and trip fee from the price estimate, and take the minimum value of this remaining surge fee and surcharge cost as estimate of the surcharges, such that zero surge fee occurs at least once in the recorded price estimates.

Surge fee

To estimate the surge fee time series, we subtract the base cost of the respective product from the total fare estimate. Since the available price estimates are rounded to integer values, the recorded price estimate may not reflect all changes of the trip fare especially for shorter trips with lower absolute total fare. This leads to small fluctuations in the extracted surge fee that do not correspond to actual surge activity.

Airport arrival data

To estimate the demand for rides at airports, we record the number of arrivals at each of the 63 airports where we recorded price estimates. We collected aircraft landing times, call signs, and type of aircraft using flightradar24's open API in the corresponding time frame, as well as information on the different aircraft's current seat configuration obtained via flightera.net. We disregard entries without call signs or real landing times. In rare cases where no seat configuration was available, we estimate the number of seats as the average of all recorded flights with the same aircraft model (or the average over all aircraft models if no other similar model was recorded).

### Megastudy shows that reminders boost vaccination but adding free rides does not [^468eeec1]. Nature (2024). Excellent credibility.

Our free-ride offering was designed to emulate the 2021 White House programme that offered people free rides by Lyft and Uber to and from vaccination sites for a limited time. Specifically, the free rides offered by the White House were available from 24 May to 4 July 2021 and required customers of Lyft (or Uber) to enter a claim code into their app to receive a free round trip ride (worth up to US$15 per ride at Lyft or up to $25 per ride at Uber). Our programme arguably made claiming free rides slightly easier than the White House programme because it simply required one click on a link in our text message to accept our offer code (the code was also supplied directly for manual entry if preferred), and our offer was then automatically applied to the next qualifying ride taken to or from a CVS Pharmacy in the patient's metropolitan area.

Patients encountered a price cap of $25 per ride only if they attempted to book a ride that exceeded this price limit, at which point they would be billed for spending in excess of $25. We estimated that in the zip codes where our test was conducted, the median resident lived 1.70 miles (2.7 km) from a CVS Pharmacy, such that the cost of a Lyft to or from the pharmacy would typically be under $10. Even patients living at the estimated 99th percentile distance from a CVS Pharmacy were only 9.40 miles (15.1 km) from a CVS Pharmacy, such that the cost of a Lyft to or from the pharmacy would typically be under $25 (see Supplementary Information, section 5 for calculation details and a complete distribution of distance and ride cost estimates).

### CDC yellow book 2026: health information for international travel. chapter 5 health care abroad [^86971d46]. CDC (2025). High credibility.

Medical evacuation insurance — medical evacuation from a resource-poor area to a hospital delivering definitive care might be necessary despite having travel health insurance. The total cost of a medevac varies by location, ranging from USD 25,000 for transport within North America to over USD 250,000 for more distant and remote locations, and costs increase when the patient being evacuated is critically ill or needs complex infection control measures. The decision to medically evacuate is at the discretion of the insurance company; it is not made at the request of the traveler, and typically, the traveler must be hospitalized with anticipation that multiple additional days of hospitalization will be required or specialized surgery or treatment is needed that is not of comparable quality at the current destination. Some medical evacuation companies have more extensive experience working in some parts of the world than others; travelers should ask about a company's resources in each region of travel, especially if planning trips to hard-to-reach locations, and if the health risks are too high, a traveler might want to postpone or cancel their international trip.

### Understanding everyday challenges of aging with disability through lived experiences [^25a1ad63]. The Gerontologist (2025). Medium credibility.

There is no way to throw a 350-pound [powerchair] in the trunk. I recently took a drive in my friend's convertible, I couldn't take my chair so once we got [there], I just had to stay in the car.

I use the bus and train around Atlanta, and I can get to most places I want to go. But if I leave the city, I can't go unless there's a vehicle that's accessible for me. And I used to fly a lot, but I just got tired of them breaking my equipment.

Despite the need for wheelchair-accessible transportation options, many described not having adequate access due to the extensive costs of owning and maintaining a personal vehicle, the limited number of accessible vehicles on taxi and ride-share fleets, and limited wheelchair spaces on public transportation, ultimately reducing their community mobility.

For vision participants, transportation accessibility challenges were primarily related to navigation and wayfinding, such as safety concerns while walking (e.g. tripping on uneven sidewalks, avoiding traffic in crosswalks). Participants discussed concerns about using taxi and ride-share services because they cannot see what the driver looks like or confirm what route they are taking. For public transportation, participants described challenges accessing up-to-date travel information (e.g. subway schedules, airplane delays, or gate changes) and often needing a sighted guide. One vision participant said,

Getting on the train or the subway is not a real challenge. Locating a seat that's empty, knowing your stops and how to get out of there. I wouldn't do subway or train unless I've done that route with a sighted person before.

### Economic impact of Lyme disease [^a1840cf3]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Study Design

We calculated the following total costs of LD: 1) direct medical costs of LD diagnosis and treatment, 2) indirect medical costs, 3) nonmedical costs, and 4) productivity losses. Intangible costs (e.g. costs incurred because of pain and suffering) were not incorporated. Consumer price index (CPI) for medical care was used to adjust all medical payments into year 2000 dollars. For nonmedical costs and productivity losses, we adjusted costs by using the general CPI. We took a societal perspective, which incorporates all costs and all benefits no matter who pays costs or who receives benefits.

Charges were used to estimate the direct medical cost. To determine the direct medical costs associated with LD, we used charge data from both DHP and office-based healthcare providers in Kent County. Direct medical costs of LD included costs (charges) of physician visits, consultation, serology, procedure, therapy, hospitalization/emergency room (ER), and other related costs (Appendix 2).

Indirect medical costs, nonmedical costs, and productivity losses were all acquired from a patient questionnaire used in 1997 and 1998. The questionnaire was sent to LD patients with informed consent forms. Collection of these data was restricted to those 2 years. In this study, indirect medical costs refer to extra prescription and nonprescription drug costs that patients paid out of pocket.

The patient's questionnaire also collected information on nonmedical payments made for home or health aides and miscellaneous services, such as travel (transportation) and babysitting. Each patient's transportation costs to a physician's office were estimated by using the US federal government reimbursement rate, multiplying the reported total travel miles per patient by $0.365/mile. Total travel mileage per patient was calculated by counting the number of physician visits and multiplying total visits by the distance of a round trip to the physician's office.

### Public transit, obesity, and medical costs: assessing the magnitudes [^4f1f8add]. Preventive Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

This paper assesses the potential benefits of increased walking and reduced obesity associated with taking public transit in terms of dollars of medical costs saved and disability avoided.

Methods

I conduct a new analysis of a nationally representative U.S. transportation survey to gauge the net increase in walking associated with public transit usage. I translate minutes spent walking into energy expenditures and reductions in obesity prevalence, estimating the present value of costs and disability that may be avoided.

Results

Taking public transit is associated with walking 8.3 more minutes per day on average, or an additional 25.7–39.0 kcal. Hill et al. [Hill, J.O. Wyatt, H.R. Reed, G.W. Peters, J.C., 2003. Obesity and the environment: Where do we go from here? Science 299 (5608), 853–855] estimate that an increase in net expenditure of 100 kcal/day can stop the increase in obesity in 90% of the population. Additional walking associated with public transit could save $5500 per person in present value by reducing obesity-related medical costs. Savings in quality-adjusted life years could be even higher.

Conclusions

While no silver bullet, walking associated with public transit can have a substantial impact on obesity, costs, and well-being. Further research is warranted on the net impact of transit usage on all behaviors, including caloric intake and other types of exercise, and on whether policies can promote transit usage at acceptable cost.

### Time and distance cost of longer acting anti-VEGF therapies for macular degeneration: contributions to drug cost comparisons [^9db930b4]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Transportation costs were derived from publicly available VA data.VA reimburses qualified patients at $0.585 per mile. An additional consideration, although not reimbursed, is the time spent for travel and clinic appointments for both the patient and, if applicable, a caregiver. This cost is an important consideration as patients with macular degeneration are often elderly and accompanied by family members or caregivers, potentially doubling the time cost of travel. As many as one-third of patients with AMD require caregiving services due to their AMD, and over 20% of patients report that caregivers take time away from work and personal activities to provide transportation to appointments, with a substantial time and financial burden. In studies investigating the cost of patient and caregiver time, self-reported wages may be employed to estimate opportunity cost. In the absence of self-reported wages, we use the federal minimum wage of $15 per hour as a proxy. Although professional caregivers may have rates exceeding federal minimum wage rates, we use federal minimum wage to conservatively estimate the cost savings to the patient. The VA system does provide a formula to calculate the estimated time of travel per given distances, which allowed us to estimate this time cost of travel within the VA system. For distances less than 30 miles, transportation time (minutes) was calculated as 3.42 + 1.70*distance (miles). For distances greater than or equal to 30 miles, it was assumed an average freeway speed of 60 miles/hour for additional mileage transportation time (minutes) calculated as 3.42 + 1.70 * 30 + 1*(distance – 30).

Medical evacuation from the mountains — helicopter evacuation from most areas is readily available, with improved communication from remote areas via satellite and cellular telephones; evacuation can often occur the same day as the request, weather permitting, but helicopter rescue is usually limited to morning hours because of afternoon winds, is billed at approximately USD 4,000 per hour with an average total cost of USD 8,000–10,000, and insurance policies generally require arranging rescue through the insurer or the traveler bears the cost.

### Effect of radiation schedule on transportation-related carbon emissions: a case study in rectal cancer [^be7998a4]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Results

A total of 334 patients treated with preoperative, definitive chemoradiation were evaluable, with 73 and 261 having received SCRT and LCRT, respectively. The median dose delivered for SCRT was 25 Gy in 5 fractions and for LCRT, 50.4 Gy in 28 fractions.

Total distance traveled for the treatment course was significantly greater in patients treated with LCRT in comparison with patients who received SCRT (median for LCRT, 1417 miles; median for SCRT, 319 miles; P < .001). Similarly, total time spent traveling was significantly higher in the LCRT versus SCRT group (median for LCRT, 30.6 hours; median for SCRT, 6.5 hours; P < .001). Cost projections quantifying dollars spent per treatment course additionally attributed higher transportation-associated costs to LCRT (median for LCRT, $892; median for SCRT, $187; P < .001) (Table 1).

Over the total treatment course, LCRT was associated with nearly 4.5 times greater GHG emissions than SCRT. Total CO 2 e emissions for LCRT and SCRT were 665.3 kg CO 2 e and 149.9 kg CO 2 e per patient treatment course, respectively (P < .001), with a net difference of 515.4 kg CO 2 e (Table 2).

### Pharmacoeconomic analysis of adjuvant oral capecitabine vs intravenous 5-FU / LV in dukes' C colon cancer: the X-ACT trial [^e4ea58ef]. British Journal of Cancer (2006). Low credibility.

The model also considered drugs used in the management of treatment-related AEs; the selection of drugs to be included in the model was based on expert clinical/pharmacist judgement. Within a class of drugs, the drug most commonly used in the clinical trial was used to estimate the unit cost in that class. The total cost of each medication was calculated by multiplying the daily cost of treatment by the total number of days of treatment used in each arm. This was then divided by the number of patients in the relevant treatment arm to provide the mean cost per patient.

Assumptions for the post-treatment costs were based on previously published lifetime costs of colorectal cancer. Costs associated with relapse were based on assumptions derived from a study reporting the cost-effectiveness of oxaliplatin/5-FU/LV in the adjuvant treatment of colorectal cancer. For the base case, the assumptions were: £100 monthly maintenance cost during prerelapse, £25 000 average cost during the relapse period, £200 monthly maintenance cost during postrelapse; and £10 000 average cost during the last 12 months of life.

Societal costs

From a societal perspective, the model also considered indirect costs borne by the patient, such as cost of travel and time for outpatient and drug administration visits. Time assumptions included travel time, as well as waiting and encounter time and was assumed to be 1.5 h for outpatient visits for management of AEs, 8 h for hospitalisations for management of AEs and 2 and 4 h, respectively, for capecitabine consultation and 5-FU/LV administration visits. The value assigned to this time was £12 per hour based on average hourly compensation in the UK. This information, together with the number of outpatient, hospital and drug administration visits in each treatment arm was used to determine the mean number of hours per patient in each treatment arm and the cost of this time. For travel costs, a 30-mile round trip was assumed and was assigned a value of £0.23 per mile. This information, together with the number of outpatient, hospital and drug administration visits in each treatment arm was used to determine the total travel cost per patient in each treatment arm.

### CDC recommendations for improving health through transportation policy [^4d4f59c9]. CDC (2010). Medium credibility.

CDC recommendations for improving health through transportation policy — CDC supports strategies that can provide a balanced portfolio of transportation choices that supports health and reduces health care costs, and states that transportation policy can reduce injuries associated with motor vehicle crashes, encourage healthy community design, promote safe and convenient opportunities for physical activity by supporting active transportation infrastructure, reduce human exposure to air pollution and adverse health impacts associated with these pollutants, and ensure that all people have access to safe, healthy, convenient, and affordable transportation. The opportunity described is that expanding the availability of, safety for, and access to a variety of transportation options and integrating health-enhancing choices into transportation policy has the potential to save lives by preventing chronic diseases, reducing and preventing motor-vehicle-related injury and deaths, improving environmental health, while stimulating economic development, and ensuring access for all people. The rationale notes that physical activity and active transportation have declined compared to previous generations and that the lack of physical activity is a major contributor to the steady rise in rates of obesity, diabetes, heart disease, stroke and other chronic health conditions in the United States; that motor vehicle crashes continue to be the leading cause of injury-related death for many age groups and pedestrians and bicyclists are at an even greater risk of death from crashes than those who travel by motor vehicles; and that many Americans view walking and bicycling within their communities as unsafe because of traffic and the lack of sidewalks, crosswalks, and bicycle facilities.

### Prevention of road crashes in older adults: perspectives on facilitators, barriers and the role of the family doctor [^abe7c1ae]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Consequences of the prohibition to continue driving

Participants stated that being deprived of their driving license would affect their mood negatively ("That's the final blow. You're tied hand and foot") (Participant 14). Although in general they would be willing to accept a driving ban, they also mentioned acquaintances who refused to comply with the recommendation or ban. Reasons for doing so were usually fear of losing their freedom and not wanting to inconvenience other family members.

"When there's a real justification, it's to your benefit [to stop driving] because you might get into really serious trouble" (Participant 16).

"Now that the family doctor says he's unfit to drive, what does he do? He asks to be transferred to a different doctor" (Participant 2).

"You like it because you can get around freely, and you don't want to bother your family for rides, so you keep on driving" (Participant 16).

If they had to stop driving, they believed they would have the support of their relatives or would use public transport (see below).

Public transport

Participants perceived the advantages of public transport, such as its price and frequency, and considered it a likely alternative if they could not drive. However, they also noted some barriers to public transport, such as the inconvenience or the high cost of some modes of transport.

"Sure, with local and intercity buses you have no problems or responsibilities, and with the discount card it's cheaper" (Participant 2).

"Look, there's a problem with the whole streetcar and city bus thing and all that. Now you have to go to a ticket office to buy a ticket, at that place, all full of people, and you're about to miss your bus… " (Participant 7).

"Well of course, if you're getting retirement benefits you might just as well hire a taxi" (Participant 5).

Nevertheless, private vehicle use was perceived as the most convenient option, and the participants recognized that this was the main reason why they did not want to stop driving.

"We prefer convenience and want to go wherever we want by car" (Participant 3).

Interim solutions

Pending further research, 'back-of-the-envelope calculations' or simple models to shed some light on a decision may help. For example, the cost-effectiveness equation model can be rearranged in such a way as to find out whether a local intervention of known cost is likely to fall below the cost-effectiveness threshold for the country concerned. Thus, given an appropriate thresholdand a net cost, the model could define how effective the intervention would have to be in order to be cost-effective in a given economy.

### Economics of interventions to increase active travel to school: a community guide systematic review [^1ba8c135]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Context

The number of children who bicycle or walk to school has steadily declined in the U.S. and other high-income countries. In response, several countries responded in recent years by funding infrastructure and noninfrastructure programs that improve the safety, convenience, and attractiveness of active travel to school. The objective of this study is to synthesize the economic evidence for the cost and benefit of these programs.

Evidence Acquisition

Literature from the inception of databases to July 2018 were searched, yielding 9 economic evaluation studies. All analyses were done in September 2018-May 2019.

Evidence Synthesis

All the studies reported cost, 6 studies reported cost benefit, and 2 studies reported cost effectiveness. The cost-effectiveness estimates were excluded on the basis of quality assessment. Cost of interventions ranged widely, with higher cost reported for the infrastructure-heavy projects from the U.S. ($91,000-$179,000 per school) and United Kingdom ($227,000-$665,000 per project). Estimates of benefits differed in the inclusion of improved safety for bicyclists and pedestrians, improved health from increased physical activity, and reduced environmental impacts due to less automobile use. The evaluations in the U.S. focused primarily on safety. The overall median benefit‒cost ratio was 4.4:1.0 (IQR = 2.2:1–6.0:1, 6 studies). The 2-year benefit-cost ratios for U.S. projects in California and New York City were 1.46:1 and 1.79:1, respectively.

Conclusions

The evidence indicates that interventions that improve infrastructure and enhance the safety and ease of active travel to schools generate societal economic benefits that exceed the societal cost.

### The cost-effectiveness of bike lanes in New York city [^5d7ecc4f]. Injury Prevention (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Our objective is to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of investments in bike lanes using New York City's (NYC) fiscal year 2015 investment as a case study. We also provide a generalizable model, so that localities can estimate their return on bike lane investments.

Methods and Findings

We evaluate the cost-effectiveness of bike lane construction using a two-stage model. Our regression analysis, to estimate the marginal addition of lane miles on the expansion in bike ridership, reveals that the 45.5 miles of bike lanes NYC constructed in 2015 at a cost of $8 109 511.47 may increase the probability of riding bikes by 9.32%. In the second stage, we constructed a Markov model to estimate the cost-effectiveness of bike lane construction. This model compares the status quo with the 2015 investment. We consider the reduced risk of injury and increased probability of ridership, costs associated with bike lane implementation and maintenance, and effectiveness due to physical activity and reduced pollution. We use Monte Carlo simulation and one-way sensitivity analysis to test the reliability of the base-case result. This model reveals that over the lifetime of all people in NYC, bike lane construction produces additional costs of $2.79 and gain of 0.0022 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) per person. This results in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $1297/QALY gained (95% CI -$544/QALY gained to $5038/QALY gained).

Conclusions

We conclude that investments in bicycle lanes come with an exceptionally good value because they simultaneously address multiple public health problems. Investments in bike lanes are more cost-effective than the majority of preventive approaches used today.

### CDC recommendations for improving health through transportation policy [^4767fece]. CDC (2010). Medium credibility.

CDC recommendations for improving health through transportation policy — key transportation and health terms are defined. Greenhouse gas emissions are gases that trap heat in the atmosphere such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O); some greenhouse gases such as CO2 occur naturally and are emitted to the atmosphere through natural processes and human activities, while other greenhouse gases (e.g., fluorinated gases) are created and emitted solely through human activities. Health impact assessment (HIA) is defined as a method by which a policy, program, or project may be judged as to its potential effects — and distribution of those effects — on the health of the population. High occupancy vehicle lane is an exclusive road/traffic lane limited to buses, van/carpools, & emergency vehicles. The United States Highway Trust Fund was established in 1956, the fund has accounts including the 'Highway Account', the 'Mass Transit Account' and the 'Leaking Underground Storage Tank Trust Fund', and money in the fund is raised via a federal fuel tax per gallon on gasoline and diesel fuel and related excise taxes. Public transportation is transportation by bus, rail, or other conveyance, either publicly or privately owned, which provides to the public general or special service on a regular and continuing basis and is also known as mass transportation, mass transit and transit. The Safe Routes to Schools Program is a Federal-Aid program of the U.S. Department of Transportation's Federal Highway Administration created by the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users Act (SAFETEA-LU), and its purposes are to enable and encourage all children to walk and bicycle to school, to make bicycling and walking to school a safer and more appealing transportation alternative, and to facilitate planning, development, and implementation of projects and activities that will improve safety and reduce traffic, fuel consumption, and air pollution in the vicinity (approximately 2 miles) of primary and middle schools (Grades K-8). Safety audits and assessments are a method by which a policy, program, or project may be judged as to its potential effects on the safety of the population. Shared-use paths are a path physically separated from motor vehicle traffic by an open space or barrier and either within a highway right-of-way or an independent right-of-way, used by bicyclists, pedestrians, joggers, skaters and other non-motorized travelers. Transit-oriented development is compact, mixed-use development near transit facilities with high-quality walking environments.

Time Cost of Travel Calculation Based on Distance Traveled to Receive Care During the First Three Years of Treatment

When considering time cost of travel and the distance cost of travel, even for a distance of 25 miles, the price differentials for the first three years of treatment grow (Table 4). Whereas, the total cost of ranibizumab for the first three-year period of treatment was $37,709 more expensive than that of faricimab, at a distance of 25 miles away from care, it becomes $38,814 more expensive. Similarly, whereas the cost of ranibizumab for the first three-year period of treatment was $31,350 more than that of aflibercept, at a distance of 25 miles away from care, it becomes $32,133 more expensive. Finally, while the cost of aflibercept for the first three-year period of treatment was only $6,359 more expensive than that of faricimab, at a distance of 25 miles away from care, it becomes $6,681 more expensive (Table 4). When considering larger distances, these cost differences grow further: at 100 miles, ranibizumab becomes $41,502.2 more expensive than faricimab and $34,038.2 more expensive than aflibercept, and aflibercept becomes $7,464 more expensive than faricimab over the first three years of treatment (Table 4).

### Cost-effectiveness of primary surgical versus primary medical management in the treatment of patients presenting with advanced glaucoma [^759d3684]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Patient costs

In addition to healthcare costs, participants' out-of-pocket expenses were calculated so that the perspective could be expanded beyond that of the UK NHS. To inform this analysis trial participants completed a time and travel questionnaire. The responses to this questionnaire were used to estimate unit costs to patients and their families of the time and travel cost of accessing each type of healthcare provider. These unit costs were combined with information on the frequency of use of services collected using the CRFs and PQ described above.

With respect to travel unit costs, if the journey was undertaken using public transport the fare was used to represent travel costs. If a journey was undertaken by private car, then a fuel rate of £0.45 per mile was applied based on the business and self-employed expenses rate per mile. The cost of participant time was valued using average costs from the Office of National Statistics. Paid work, childcare, caring for relative or friend and voluntary work was valued as £13.88 an hour, housework and leisure activities were valued at £10.10 an hour. Time spent in unemployment, retirement or in full time education was valued as £6.04 an hour. Finally, private out of pockets expenses (eg, private appointments, spectacles) as captured on the PQ were included in patient time and travel costs. A table describing each of the unit costs is included in online supplemental tables A1–A5.

### Modeled cost-effectiveness of a rideshare program to facilitate colonoscopy completion [^938663c4]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

Using a microsimulation model, we demonstrated that increasing colonoscopy completion in a population with abnormal FIT results via a rideshare intervention was associated with reduced CRC incidence and mortality and would be cost saving at a mean cost of $40 or $100 per ride. Our results suggest that depending on the age at which screening begins and the magnitude of follow-up colonoscopy completion, the rideshare intervention could cost up to a maximum of $498 per ride and remain cost saving. Noninvasive CRC screening in the US is cost saving because it prevents CRC, avoiding higher CRC treatment costs ($2.5 billion vs $21.35 billion). Therefore, improving follow-up colonoscopy after abnormal screening tests is essential for reducing CRC incidence and death and reducing the costs of cancer care.

Ensuring follow-up of abnormal noninvasive cancer screening tests is also increasingly important given advances in single cancer and multicancer blood-based detection assays. Blood-based assays might potentially increase overall screening participation which has been a persistent challenge across many screening programs, including CRC. Yet, 1 study found that a FIT screening program with lower initial adherence (45%) but high follow-up colonoscopy completion (80%), had greater benefit at a lower cost than a blood-based test with perfect adherence. These findings highlight that without effective follow-up of abnormal results, the potential advantages of increased CRC screening through emerging blood-based tests may not be fully realized.

Notably, there are multiple barriers to colonoscopy after abnormal stool-based tests, including lack of transportation and/or chaperones; yet interventions to address this challenge are limited, especially in populations that experience the greatest disease burden. In the US, Black and American Indian or Alaskan Native populations have the highest CRC-mortality, yet have lower follow-up colonoscopy completion rates. One modeling study concluded that if Black adults had the same follow-up colonoscopy rates as White adults, CRC incidence and mortality would decrease by 5.2% and 9.3%, respectively, resulting in a 3.4% improvement in LYG (256 to 265). Yet, most studies aiming to improve follow-up colonoscopy to date have only focused on patient navigation, which increased follow-up colonoscopy completion by a mean (range) 13.6 (5.0–21.1) percentage points. Implementation details to support widespread adoption of navigation programs that improve follow-up are also direly needed.

### Cost effectiveness of strategies to combat road traffic injuries in sub-saharan Africa and south east Asia: mathematical modelling study [^99184e14]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Estimation and modeling of intervention effectiveness

The World Health Organization — Choosing Interventions that are Cost effective (WHO-CHOICE) project employs an epidemiological approach to the estimation of population level effects of different health interventions. Specifically, the effect of a given intervention on the healthy life expectancy of a population is derived with reference to two epidemiological situations, one with the intervention in place (for a period of 10 years), the other without the intervention or a counterfactual situation referred to as a "null scenario" (derived by subtracting the known effects of currently implemented interventions). The difference between these two situations over the lifetime of the population (set at 100 years) represents the net effect of the intervention, expressed in terms of disability adjusted life years (DALYs) saved. These epidemiological scenarios can be estimated via a multistate population model, which traces the development of a population, taking into account births, deaths, and the disease or injury in question (see general appendix on bmj.com).

For the road traffic injury model, non-fatal acute injuries of short term duration were excluded from the analysis (cuts, bruises, most fractures of the leg or arm, etc), since they represent less than 10% of the estimated non-fatal burden of road traffic injuries. Accordingly, the key parameters of interest are the acute mortality from road traffic injury and the incidence, prevalence, and case fatality of long term road traffic injury (as well as its associated level of disability). These rates, together with data sources and derivation methods, are detailed in appendix A on bmj.com.

Interventions selected for this analysis draw on the recommendations of the World Report on Road Traffic Injury Prevention, and are specifically focused on those pre-event road safety measures that are capable of changing human factors (since they have robust evidence for their effectiveness and are amenable to intervention costing at the population level). These include enforcement of speed limits (via mobile speed cameras), drink-drive legislation and enforcement (via breath testing campaigns), legislation and primary enforcement of seatbelt use in cars (drivers and passengers), legislation and enforcement of helmet use by motorcyclists (all riders), and legislation and enforcement of helmet use by bicyclists (aged < 15 years).

### Estimated resource costs for implementation of CDC's recommended COVID-19 mitigation strategies in pre-kindergarten through grade 12 public schools-United States, 2020–21 school year [^bc11c78a]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2020). Medium credibility.

A microcosting approach was used to estimate resources and costs associated with implementing the critical CDC-recommended mitigation strategies. This approach involves collecting detailed data on resources needed for each strategy and applying unit costs for those resources. From a school budget perspective, resources needed to implement the four strategies are identified (Supplementary Table,), and total costs associated with each resource are estimated. Direct budgetary costs are the focus of this analysis; opportunity costs are excluded. The estimates indicate resources needed in addition to those already allocated in annual school budgets. Costs were aggregated and analyzed nationally and for each state and the District of Columbia (DC). A range is provided for each cost to indicate levels of cost variation around each estimate.

Personnel costs for school custodians were estimated using data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. * To account for fringe benefits, annual wages were increased by the state and local government average of 37.8%. † Labor demand for school custodians was derived from a study of national standards for allocating school custodians that increases the recommended number of custodians from a tier 3 level of cleaning (one custodian per 28,000–31,000 ft 2) to a tier 2 level of cleaning (one custodian per 18,000–20,000 ft 2). The American Federation of Teachers estimates that tier 2 cleaning is needed for an estimated 10% of targeted physical areas per school (i.e. bathrooms, food service areas, and high-need classrooms, including special needs classes). To allow for variation in school size, ranges of estimates for additional custodial services were estimated. The low estimate used an additional 1.25 full time equivalents (FTEs), and the high estimate used 2.5 FTEs (Supplementary Table). Costs are inflated and reported in 2020 U.S. dollars. § Potential additional transportation costs were extrapolated from a report by the American Federation of Teachers that forecasts an estimated 36% national increase in funding needed for school transportation. These potential costs assume that some schools would require additional buses, drivers, and protocols to implement social distancing on buses. The 36% national increase was distributed across states and adjusted by states' past year transportation spending per student. Ranges for nonlabor costs for all materials and consumables were obtained from the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) Supply Catalog 2020, GSA Advantage Disaster Relief and Pandemic Products online catalog, and through various e-commerce marketplace websites to derive a range of cost estimates across multiple sources and reflect price variability for materials across vendors. Aggregated material costs were adjusted for each state using the 2020 state-based composite cost of living index. Average costs per student were calculated using the national preK–12 public student enrollment of 50,685,567 students. State-based cost estimates were adjusted based on the number of schools and the total school population within each state. Estimated pandemic-related per-student costs were calculated as a percentage of fiscal year 2018 per-student expenditures as reported by the National Center for Education Statistics.

### Estimated indirect cost savings of using telehealth among nonelderly patients with cancer [^3f14d620]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Importance

Patients with cancer typically have greater financial hardships and time costs than individuals without cancer. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated this, while posing substantial challenges to delivering cancer care and resulting in important changes in care-delivery models, including the rapid adoption of telehealth.

Objective

To estimate patient travel, time, and cost savings associated with telehealth for cancer care delivery.

Design, Setting, and Participants

An economic evaluation of cost savings from completed telehealth visits from April 1, 2020, to June 30, 2021, in a single-institution National Cancer Institute-Designated Comprehensive Cancer Center. All patients aged 18 to 65 years who completed telehealth visits within the designated time frame and had a Florida mailing address documented in their electronic medical record were included in the study cohort. Data were analyzed from April 2020 to June 2021.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The main outcome was estimated patient cost savings from telehealth, which included 2 components: costs of travel (defined as roundtrip distance saved from car travel) and potential loss of productivity due to the medical visit (defined as loss of income from roundtrip travel plus loss of income from in-person clinic visits). Two different models with a combination of 2 different mileage rates ($0.56 and $0.82 per mile) and census tract-level median hourly wages were used.

Results

The study included 25 496 telehealth visits with 11 688 patients. There were 4525 (3795 patients) new or established visits and 20 971 (10 049 patients) follow-up visits. Median (IQR) age was 55.0 (46.0–61.0) years among the telehealth visits, with 15 663 visits (61.4%) by women and 18 360 visits (72.0%) by Hispanic non-White patients. According to cost models, the estimated mean (SD) total cost savings ranged from $147.4 ($120.1) at $0.56/mile to $186.1 ($156.9) at $0.82/mile. For new or established visits, the mean (SD) total cost savings per visit ranged from $176.6 ($136.3) at $0.56/mile to $222.8 ($177.4) at $0.82/mile, and for follow-up visits, the mean (SD) total cost savings per visit was $141.1 ($115.3) at $0.56/mile to $178.1 ($150.9) at $0.82/mile.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this economic evaluation, telehealth was associated with savings in patients time and travel costs, which may reduce the financial toxicity of cancer care. Expansion of telehealth oncology services may be an effective strategy to reduce the financial burden among patients with cancer.

### Economic impact of reduced state trauma mortality on lifetime personal income and state tax revenue [^e1d404ea]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

A broad category which includes everything from motor vehicle crashes and falls to gun violence and drug overdoses, trauma especially impacts Americans in the prime of their lives. Unintentional injury was the fourth leading cause of death for all Americans in 2020 and was the leading cause of death for those aged 1–44. Trauma thus imposes significant economic costs on society, contributing to disability, loss of productivity, and rising healthcare costs. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that traumatic injuries cost the American economy roughly $4.2 trillion in 2019 as a result of medical and administrative costs, lost wages and productivity, declining quality of life and earning potential, and foregone tax revenue. Over half of this cost ($2.4 trillion) was associated with injuries to working age Americans, those 20–64 years old.

Our analysis focuses on the state of Georgia, a large state of nearly 11 million people with a bustling economy and nationally-representative earning potential. In 2003, Georgia suffered from a trauma mortality rate 16% above the national average. By 2020, Georgia's trauma mortality rate had decreased to 6% below the national average, which was a global improvement affecting all population groups. It would be reasonable to expect that reduced mortality would result in a positive economic impact. The purpose of this study is to assess the state-wide economic impact of reduced mortality and disability measured in the amount of lifetime personal income and state tax revenue preserved.

### An analysis of cancer center-provided rideshare utilization for radiation therapy [^dd5972f5]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The potential of rideshare services to facilitate timely radiation therapy (RT), especially for resource-limited patients, is understudied.

Methods

Patients (n = 63) who received 73 courses of RT (1,513 fractions) and utilized free hospital-provided rideshare service (537 rides) were included in this retrospective study. A multidimensional analysis was conducted including a comparison of demographic, disease characteristics, and treatment completion data; a revenue analysis to evaluate the financial impact of rideshare services; and a geospatial analysis to evaluate community-level characteristics of patients.

Results

Median age was 59; most were female (56%) and self-identified as Black or African American (56%), not working (91%), not partnered (83%), high school educated or less (78%), and insured with Medicaid (51%). Geospatial analysis revealed that patients lived in communities with significantly higher rates of resource deprivation. Median rideshare distance was 6.4 miles (interquartile range 3.4–11.2) with a median cost of $13.04 per rideshare (interquartile range 9–19). Of the rideshare-facilitated treatments, 100% were completed, with an overall course completion rate of 97.3% compared with 85.4% for those who did not use rideshare (P = 0.001); two patients discontinued RT for reasons unrelated to transportation. High rideshare utilization (n = 32), defined as utilization ≥ 45% of the treatment course, was associated with significantly shorter treatment courses and lower radiation doses compared with low rideshare utilization (P = 0.04). Total rideshare cost for high utilizers and whole cohort was $11,589 and $16,895, facilitating an estimated revenue of $401,952 and $1,175,119, respectively.

Conclusions

Free hospital-provided rideshare service is economically feasible and associated with high RT completion rates. It may help enhance quality radiation care for those who come from resource-limited communities.

### National mandatory motorcycle helmet laws may save $ 2.2 billion annually: an inpatient and value of statistical life analysis [^2e1b938a]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Background

While statistics exist regarding the overall rate of fatalities in motorcyclists with and without helmets, a combined inpatient and value of statistical life (VSL) analysis has not previously been reported.

Methods

Statistical data of motorcycle collisions were obtained from the Centers for Disease Control, National Highway Transportation Safety Board, and Governors Highway Safety Association. The VSL estimate was obtained from the 2002 Department of Transportation calculation. Statistics on helmeted versus nonhelmeted motorcyclists, death at the scene, and inpatient death were obtained using the 2010 National Trauma Data Bank. Inpatient costs were obtained from the 2010 National Inpatient Sample. Population estimates were generated using weighted samples, and all costs are reported using 2010 US dollars using the Consumer Price Index.

Results

A total of 3,951 fatal motorcycle collisions were reported in 2010, of which 77% of patients died at the scene, 10% in the emergency department, and 13% as inpatients. Thirty-seven percent of all riders did not wear a helmet but accounted for 69% of all deaths. Of those motorcyclists who survived to the hospital, the odds ratio of surviving with a helmet was 1.51 compared with those without a helmet (p < 0.001). Total costs for nonhelmeted motorcyclists were 66% greater at $5.5 billion, compared with $3.3 billion for helmeted motorcyclists (p < 0.001). Direct inpatient costs were 16% greater for helmeted riders ($203,248 vs. $175,006) but led to more than 50% greater VSL generated (absolute benefit, $602,519 per helmeted survivor).

Conclusion

A cost analysis of inpatient care and indirect costs of motorcycle riders who do not wear helmets leads to nearly $2.2 billion in losses per year, with almost 1.9 times as many deaths compared with helmeted motorcyclists. The per capita cost per fatality is more than $800,000. Institution of a mandatory helmet law could lead to an annual cost savings of almost $2.2 billion.

Telehealth was associated with an estimated $1 170 160 savings in lost productivity (income) due to driving time, $467 247 savings in lost productivity due to visit time, and $1 637 407 total savings in lost productivity (Table 2, Figure 2 B, 2 C, and 2 D). For new or established visits, the following savings were noted: $245 113 savings in lost productivity due to driving time, $104 522 savings in lost productivity due to visit time, and $349 655 total savings in lost productivity. For follow-up visits, the following savings were noted: $925 027 savings in lost productivity due to driving time, $362 725 savings in lost productivity due to visit time, and $1 287 752 total savings in lost productivity. Mean (SD) savings in lost productivity per visit due to driving time were $45.9 (41.5) per visit overall, and $54.1 (47.9) for new or established visits and $44.1 (39.7) for follow-up visits (Table 2, Figure 3 A). Mean (SD) savings per visit in lost productivity due to visit time was $18.3 (5.9) per visit overall, and $23.1 (6.9) for new or established visits and $17.3 (5.1) for follow-up visits. Estimated mean (SD) total savings per visit from lost productivity was $64.2 (43.6) per visit overall, $77.2 (50.6) for new or established visits, and $61.4 (41.4) for follow-up visits. Total driving-cost savings ranged from $2 122 379 at $0.56/mile (Figure 3 B) to $3 107 777 at $0.82/mile (Figure 3 C). For new or established visits, total driving-cost savings were $450 782 at $0.56/mile to $660 074 at $0.82/mile, while for follow-up visits, total driving-cost savings were $1 671 597 at $0.56/mile to $2 447 695 at $0.82/mile. According to cost models, the mean (SD) driving cost savings per visit ranged from $83.2 ($80.5) at $0.56/mile to $122.0 ($118.0) at $0.82/mile (Table 2, Figure 3 B and 3 D). For new or established visits, the mean (SD) driving cost savings per visit ranged from $99.6 ($90.5) at $0.56/mile to $146.0 ($132.6) at $0.82/mile, and for follow-up visits, the mean (SD) cost savings per visit was $79.7 ($77.7) at $0.56/mile to $116.7 ($113.8) at $0.82/mile. According to cost models, the mean (SD) total cost savings per visit ranged from $147.4 ($120.1) at $0.56/mile to $186.1 ($156.9) at $0.82/mile (Table 2, Figure 3 B and 3 D). For new or established visits, the mean (SD) total cost savings per visit ranged from $176.6 ($136.3) at $0.56/mile to $222.8 ($177.4) at $0.82/mile, and for follow-up visits, the mean total cost savings per visit was $141.1 ($115.3) at $0.56/mile to $178.1 ($150.9) at $0.82/mile.

### Distance traveled for an abortion and source of care after abortion [^5305835c]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine the association between distance traveled for an abortion and site of postabortion care among low-income women.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective cohort study using claims data from 39,747 abortions covered by California's Medicaid program in 2011–2012. Primary outcomes were the odds of abortion-related visits to an emergency department (ED) and the original abortion site, and the secondary outcome was total abortion care costs. We used mixed-effects logistic regression adjusting for patient and abortion characteristics to examine the associations between distance traveled and subsequent abortion-related care at each location.

Results

Among all abortions (N = 39,747), 3% (95% CI 2.9–3.3, n = 1,232) were followed by an ED visit (3% first-trimester aspirations, 2% second trimester or later, and 4% medication abortions) and 25% (95% CI 24.1–24.9, n = 9,745) were followed by a visit to the original abortion site (4% first-trimester aspirations, 3% second-trimester or later, and 77% medication abortions). Women traveling farther for their abortions had higher odds of visiting an ED (100 or more miles compared with less than 25 miles, first-trimester aspirations: adjusted odds ratio [OR] 2.29, 95% CI 1.50–3.49; medication abortions: adjusted OR 2.30, 95% CI 1.34–3.93) and lower odds of returning to their abortion site for follow-up (100 or more miles compared with less than 25 miles, first-trimester aspirations: adjusted OR 0.36, 95% CI 0.18–0.70; second trimester or later: adjusted OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.31–0.88; and medication abortions: adjusted OR 0.33, 95% CI 0.23–0.50). Costs were consistently higher when subsequent care occurred at an ED rather than the abortion site (median cost $941 compared with $536, P < .001).

Conclusion

For most patients, greater distance traveled for abortion was associated with increased likelihood of seeking subsequent care at an ED. Increasing the number of rural Medicaid abortion providers and reimbursing providers for telemedicine and alternatives to routine follow-up would likely improve continuity of care and reduce state costs by shifting the location of follow-up from EDs back to abortion providers.

Table 1
Vehicle operating ranges and battery sizes for medium-duty vehicles (MDVs) and heavy-duty vehicles (HDVs)

km kilometer, mi mile, VKT vehicle kilometers traveled, kWh kilowatt-hour.

The electrified roadway was assumed to provide continuous power, maintain the vehicle's state of charge, and be used by cars, LDTs, MDVs, HDVs, and buses. The minimum portion (R) of each roadway segment (i) that is needed to be electrified for each vehicle category was calculated in Eq. (2) based on the segment's speed limit (S), receiving pad power rating (P) of 50-kW, number of receiving pads (N) on the vehicle (v), vehicle energy efficiencies per VKT (EE), charging efficiency (CE) of 85%, and amount failed (F). The amount failed was calculated in Eq. (1) based on the VKT by each vehicle type over the life of the roadway segment, number of receiving pads on the vehicle, failure rate (FR) of 2.87 pads per million hours, number of roadway pads (RP) per segment (200 per kilometer (km)), and speed limit.

The electrified portion of the roadway was modeled based on the vehicle category that needed the highest portion electrified. The number of receiving pads for each vehicle category depended on their charging requirements and wheelbase allowances, with cars having one pad, LDTs having two pads, MDVs having four pads, and HDVs and buses having five pads.

### Effect of a prize-linked savings intervention on savings and healthy behaviors among men in Kenya: a randomized clinical trial [^d56552ae]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Results

Between September 3 and October 5, 2018, we screened 425 men, of whom 329 (77.4%) met eligibility criteria and 300 (70.6%) consented and were enrolled in the study (148 randomized to the control group and 152 randomized to the intervention group). The most common reason for ineligibility was age younger than 21 years (n = 39). Among 300 participants, 270 (90.0%) (136 control and 134 intervention) opened accounts with the partner bank. We conducted follow-up interviews with 292 of 300 participants (97.3%) (142 control and 150 intervention), including 267 (98.9%) of those who opened bank accounts. Participants' bank accounts were monitored for a mean (SD) of 9 (2) weeks after they were opened, and follow-up interviews were conducted a mean (SD) of 12 (1) weeks after enrollment. One participant withdrew from the study before the follow-up survey.

Participants' demographic and economic characteristics were similar across control and intervention groups. Participants' mean age was 33.7 years (interquartile range [IQR], 13.5 years), 84.3% (253 of 300) were married, and their occupations were evenly divided between fishing (51.3% [154 of 300]) and transportation (48.7% [146 of 300]) (Table 1). Participants had a mean weekly earnings of US $30 (IQR, US $23), which were higher among fishermen (US $34) than among the transportation workers (ie, motorbike taxi drivers) (US $26). Almost 70% (197 of 300) of respondents did not have any savings in a bank at baseline. Respondents reported a mean of US $93 (IQR, US $88) in formal and informal savings. Almost all participants (97.7% [293 of 300]) had an account with the mobile money platform MPesa.

### Cost effectiveness of strategies to combat road traffic injuries in sub-saharan Africa and south east Asia: mathematical modelling study [^56703c34]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Road traffic injuries represent a leading and increasing contributor to regional and global disease and injury burden. It is estimated that in 2002 road crashes killed over one million people worldwide and injured or disabled a further 20–50 million. Road traffic injuries are projected to become the third largest contributor to global disease burden by 2030. Most of the projected increase will occur in low and middle income regions of the world because of the rapid growth in motor vehicle numbers increasing exposure to risk factors such as speed and alcohol, and exacerbated by inadequate enforcement of traffic safety regulations and public health infrastructure.

There is marked variation across the world in the way that roads are used and injuries are caused, which have important implications for road safety policy and practice. Road traffic injuries in highly motorised countries mostly involve car drivers, whereas in certain countries of Asia it is motorcycle riders and in many low income countries it is occupants of multiple passenger vehicles (such as buses) and pedestrians. There is also variation in the breakdown of these injuries by underlying cause (road infrastructure versus vehicle design versus exposure to risk factors such as speeding or not wearing a seatbelt). In order to estimate the potential impact of different road safety measures on health at the population level, therefore, a good understanding of underlying patterns of road use and injury burden is required. Despite the existence of injury surveillance systems in several countries, such information is in short supply. There is also a shortage of evidence on the comparative population level costs and cost effectiveness of different intervention strategies for reducing traffic injuries — an important gap in the knowledge base needed to attract new investment and guide decision making.

As a contribution to studying the public health response to road safety at the global level, this study set out to identify and estimate in different world regions the population level costs and effects of a limited set of currently used and potentially applicable interventions for reducing the burden of road traffic injuries.

### The impact of urban speed reduction programmes on health system cost and utilities [^b8622bb0]. Injury Prevention (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Vehicle speed changes impact the probability of injuring a pedestrian in ways that differ from the way that it impacts the probability of a collision or of death. Therefore, return on investment in speed reduction programmes has complex and unpredictable manifests. The objective of this study is to analyse the impact of motor vehicle speed reduction on the collision-related morbidity and mortality rates of urban pedestrians.

Methods and Findings

We created a simple way to estimate the public health impacts of traffic speed changes using a Markov model. Our outcome measures include the cost of injury, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained and probability of death and injury due to a road traffic collision. Our two-way sensitivity analysis of speed, both before the implementation of a speed reduction programme and after, shows that, due to key differences in the probability of injury compared with the probability of death, speed reduction programmes may decrease the probability of death while leaving the probability of injury unchanged. The net result of this difference may lead to an increase in injury costs due to the implementation of a speed reduction programme. We find that even small investments in speed reductions have the potential to produce gains in QALYs.

Conclusions

Our reported costs, effects and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios may assist urban governments and stakeholders to rethink the value of local traffic calming programmes and to implement speed limits that would shift the trade-off to become between minor injuries and no injuries, rather than severe injuries and fatalities.

### Announcement: world day of remembrance for road traffic victims-November 19, 2017 [^1a527078]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2017). Low credibility.

In October 2005, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution to mark the third Sunday in November each year as World Day of Remembrance for Road Traffic Victims to honor persons killed or injured in road crashes, recognize their families and communities, and pay tribute to the emergency crews, police, and medical professionals who deal with the traumatic aftermath of road deaths and injuries. *

Road traffic injuries are the ninth leading cause of death worldwide and the leading cause of death among persons aged 15–29 years. Approximately 1.25 million persons die each year on the world's roads, and 20 million to 50 million sustain nonfatal injuries. Although 90% of road traffic deaths occur in low-income and middle-income countries, approximately 100 persons die and thousands more are injured in motor vehicle crashes every day in the United States.

A 2016 CDC study found that, among 19 high-income countries, the United States had the most motor vehicle crash deaths per 100,000 persons and per 10,000 registered vehicles, the second highest percentage of deaths involving alcohol-impaired driving, and the third lowest use of front seat belts. Recent trends do not show evidence of improvement. In 2016, a total of 37,461 persons were killed in road traffic crashes in the United States, a 5.6% increase from 2015.

The U.S. Department of Transportation and the National Safety Council have joined with partners, including CDC, to launch the Road to Zero Coalition, with the goal of eliminating U.S. traffic deaths by 2050. In the United States alone, implementing proven effective strategies to prevent road traffic deaths can save thousands of lives and hundreds of millions of dollars. A new Road Safety Annual Report released by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development provides a global perspective. It outlines specific recommendations, potential numbers of lives saved, and potential economic losses prevented in International Road Traffic and Accident Database member and observer countries.

CDC supports United Nations and World Health Organization measures to dedicate 2011–2020 as the Decade of Action for Road Safety. The program was launched in May 2011 in approximately 100 countries, with the goal of preventing 5 million road traffic deaths globally by 2020. The United Nations is committed to measures to halve the number of global road traffic deaths and injuries by 2020 as one of its Sustainable Development Goals. Strategies to support victims and survivors and a guide for nongovernmental organizations are available at.

### Applying Bayesian cognitive models to decisions to drive after drinking [^c3e2ee7c]. Addiction (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Despite widespread negative perceptions, the prevalence of alcohol-impaired driving (AID) in the United States remains unacceptably high. This study used a novel decision task to evaluate whether individuals considered both ride service cost and alcohol consumption level when deciding whether or not to drive, and whether the resulting strategy was associated with engagement in AID.

Design

A two-sample study, where sample 1 developed a novel AID decision task to classify participants by decision strategy. Sample 2 was used to cross-validate the task and examine whether decision strategy classifications were predictive of prior reported AID behavior.

Setting

A laboratory setting at the University of Missouri, USA.

Participants

Sample 1 included 38 student participants from introductory psychology classes at the University of Missouri. Sample 2 included 67 young adult participants recruited from the local community.

Measurements

We developed a decision task that presented hypothetical drinking scenarios that varied in quantity of alcohol consumption (one to six drinks) and the cost of a ride service ($5–25). We applied a Bayesian computational model to classify choices as consistent with either: integrating both ride cost and consumption level (compensatory) or considering only consumption level (non-compensatory) when making hypothetical AID decisions. In sample 2, we assessed established AID risk factors (sex, recent alcohol consumption, perceived safe limit) and recent (past 3 months) engagement in AID.

Findings

In sample 1, the majority of participants were classified as using decision strategies consistent with either a compensatory or non-compensatory process. Results from sample 2 replicated the overall classification rate and demonstrated that participants who used a compensatory strategy were more likely to report recent AID, even after accounting for study covariates.

Conclusions

In a hypothetical alcohol-impaired driving (AID) decision task, individuals who considered both consumption level and ride service cost were more likely to report recent AID than those who made decisions based entirely on consumption level.

### Effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the daily mile on childhood weight outcomes and wellbeing: a cluster randomised controlled trial [^be8ea702]. International Journal of Obesity (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Childhood obesity is a major public health problem. Worldwide, around one in five children aged 5–19 years are either overweight or living with obesity. In response to this global epidemic, the World Health Assembly adopted the 'WHO global action plan for prevention and control of non-communicable diseases' including halting childhood obesity rates by 2025. Children living with obesity are more likely to be overweight in adulthood, with associated greater risk of a range of chronic diseases and premature death. Obesity also has a significant economic burden leading to costs equivalent to 2.8% of global gross domestic product. The causes of the energy imbalance responsible for excess weight gain are the result of several interacting factors; including genetics, poor diet and physical inactivity. The WHO global action plan for obesity guides action at the national, regional and local level and, as children spend a large proportion of their waking time in school, this has been cited as an appropriate setting to deliver childhood obesity prevention interventions. This is supported by findings from high-quality systematic reviews that suggest school-based interventions may be effective, although the heterogeneity of the included studies precludes recommendations on the exact intervention.

The 'Daily Mile' is a school-based intervention that involves children doing an additional 15 min of physical activity every school day, over and above national curriculum physical education (PE) and timetabled break times. Based mainly on anecdotal reports of benefit in terms of reducing obesity and improving academic attainment, as well as seemingly low cost, over 6000 schools and nurseries (pre-school centres) worldwide have adopted the intervention. Furthermore the UK Government called for all primary schools to adopt initiatives such as The Daily Mile within their updated Childhood Obesity Plan. However published evaluations of the intervention are limited to one small school pilot non-randomised study, which suggested a minimal reduction in body fat in children following introduction of The Daily Mile. A Cochrane review of previous school based physical activity interventions has shown that whilst overall such programmes increase physical activity levels during the school period and reduce the time children are sedentary, their impact on overall physical activity levels is relatively small (between 5 and 45 min additional activity per week), and there was no evidence that the programmes reduce levels of obesity.

In this cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT), we aimed to evaluate the clinical- and cost-effectiveness of The Daily Mile for obesity prevention in children, when compared with usual health and wellbeing activities in schools.

### Carbon emissions from patient travel for health care [^33dbafd2]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Importance

The US health care sector accounts for about 8.5% of national greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Reliable estimates of emissions associated with health care-related travel are essential for informing policy changes.

Objective

To generate a comprehensive national estimate of carbon emissions due to patient health care-related travel in the US.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cross-sectional study used data from the 2022 National Household Travel Survey (NHTS), conducted from January 2022 to January 2023. Participants were selected using an address-based sample from the US Postal Service Delivery Sequence File. Participating households reported all trips taken within 24 hours by all household members aged 5 years or older. Approximate emissions per mile were obtained from typical vehicle emissions data provided by US government institutions. Data were analyzed between March 11 and May 29, 2024.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Estimated annual CO2 equivalent (CO2e) emissions from patient health care-related travel per year, per patient, per trip, and per mile. A survey-weighted λ regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with higher CO2e emissions per trip. An alternative scenario analysis estimated reductions if 30% or 50% of private vehicle users switched to electric vehicles.

Results

The sample included 16 997 participants with a weighted total of 3 506 325 536 US health care trips. Of these trips, 52.0% were reported by female travelers, 80.1% were made in urban areas, and 19.9% were made in rural areas. These trips accounted for 84 057 963 340 miles, resulting in weighted annual estimated emissions of 35.7 megatons (Mt) (95% CI, 27.5–43.9 Mt) CO2e. Each mile traveled generated an estimated 424 g (95% CI, 418–428 g) CO2e. Emissions per trip were higher (exponentiated coefficient [exp(β)], 2.19; 95% CI, 1.51–2.86; P < .001) for rural patients compared with urban patients. However, 69.3% of emissions were attributable to urban patients and 30.7% to rural patients. Patients with annual median household incomes of $50 000 to $99 999 generated higher trip emissions (exp[β], 1.92; 95% CI, 1.09–2.76; P = 0.003) compared with those with incomes of $25 000 or less. A 30% shift to electric vehicles was estimated to reduce health care-related carbon emissions to 27.6 Mt (95% CI, 20.7–34.6 Mt) CO2e, and a 50% shift was estimated to lower emissions to 22.3 Mt (95% CI, 16.0–28.6 Mt) CO2e.

Conclusions and Relevance

This cross-sectional study estimated that annual patient health care-related travel in the US generated 35.7 Mt CO2e, which accounts for a small but important proportion of total health care-related emissions in the US. These findings are essential for informing health care policy decisions and suggest that strategies such as telehealth and the adoption of electric vehicles may contribute to a small but significant reduction in health care-related GHG emissions.

### Association of cost-driven residential moves with health-related outcomes among California renters [^41886e37]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Results

Study Participants

Among 52 646 adults, 90.9% were renters and 9.1% were other nonhomeowners. Overall, 50.3% of participants were female, 49.7% were male, 85.2% were younger than 60 years, and 55.1% reported income lower than 200% of the federal poverty level (Table). With regard to race and ethnicity, 45.3% of participants were Hispanic, 13.2% were non-Hispanic Asian, 7.7% were non-Hispanic Black, 30.9% were non-Hispanic White, and 3.0% were of other non-Hispanic races (including American Indian or Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, ≥ 2 races, and self-reported other race). In total, 8.9% of participants reported making a cost-driven move in the past 3 years, with higher prevalence among Hispanic (9.9%) and non-Hispanic Black (11.3%) renters compared with non-Hispanic White renters (7.2%). Overall, 15.4% of all recent moves were due to cost (eTable 2 in Supplement 1).

### CDC recommendations for improving health through transportation policy [^ff2733bc]. CDC (2010). Medium credibility.

CDC recommendations for improving health through transportation policy — promote active transportation by stating that active transportation systems should connect the places where people live, learn, work, shop, and play by providing safe and convenient walking and bicycling facilities, and that the safety of all road users can increase as more people choose active transportation. Recommendations include: Promote safe and convenient opportunities for physical activity by supporting active transportation infrastructure, such as well-lit sidewalks, shared-use paths, and recreational trails; safe roadway crossings; creation of bicycle-supporting infrastructure including shared-use paths and interventions that reduce motor vehicle traffic and vehicle speed on neighborhood streets (e.g. bicycle boulevards); safe pedestrian and bicycling connections to public transportation; and safe and convenient pedestrian and bicycling connections to public park and recreation areas. Increase opportunities for physical activity by devoting increased resources to non-motorized transportation options. Consider incentives for states and regions that reduce vehicle miles traveled per capita and implement active living environments that promote walking and bicycling, using public transportation, and reducing air pollution (including greenhouse gas emissions). Provide states with tools necessary to evaluate and effectively increase investments in bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure and programming, with activities to be evaluated that could include comprehensive street design measures, complementary systems of shared-use paths connected to roadways, bicycle-supporting infrastructure including shared use paths and interventions that reduce motor vehicle traffic and speed on neighborhood streets to provide direct, safe routes for bicyclists, and "Safe Routes to School" initiatives including the development of sidewalks, shared-use paths and bicycle infrastructure to ensure that children can walk and bicycle safely to school; Safe Routes to School programs also include support activities, such as education, encouragement, enforcement, and evaluation. Bring health, transportation and community planners together to develop safe, convenient, and complete pedestrian and bicycle master plans, including an inventory of current sidewalks, bicycle facilities, recreational trails, and shared-use paths, which can be incorporated into city general plans and capital improvement programs.

### Evaluation of a fitness intervention for new firefighters: injury reduction and economic benefits [^009de07d]. Injury Prevention (2016). Low credibility.

Costs of the intervention

The costs of the PFF-Fit programme included personnel costs and materials costs and are detailed in table 5. The TFD Safety and Health Captain invested approximately 15% of his time (6 h/week) for a period of 6 months, including the RA, and approximately 2.5% (1 h/week) during the probationary year, which cost TFD approximately US$12 267.84 in wages and benefits for his time. Four PFTs were assigned to the RA: one PFT was assigned to the Academy as part of the training staff and dedicated an estimated 5 h/week to PFT duties, two visiting PFTs conducted functional fitness workouts 3 days/week (Monday, Wednesday and Friday) and one visiting PFT participated once a month for long-distance runs (> 1.5 miles) on Thursdays. Wages and benefits costs for the PFT who served on the training staff are estimated to be US$2611.00. These costs were paid out of the department's training budget and represent costs for this PFT's time, as this PFT was taken out of his/her normal duty rotation for 20 weeks of the RA and dedicated this portion of his time to the PFF-Fit programme. The overtime wages and benefits costs for visiting PFTs are estimated to total US$9792.50. These PFTs completed their regular department duties during the RA and were paid overtime for their participation in the PFF-Fit programme. During the probationary year, PFT mentors completed up to four instation visits with their assigned probationary firefighters. An estimated US$6708.96 in personnel costs was incurred for these instation visits. A nutritionist spent 11 h in meetings and preparing materials and presentations, then provided a 1 h presentation and spent another hour reviewing health records for the 2012 recruit class at a total cost of US$661.90. Materials costs, beyond those that are normally incurred for the RA, were minimal. TFD produced fitness logs for each of the 32 members of the 2012 recruit class at an estimated cost of US$150. An estimated total of US$32 192.20 was invested in the PFF-Fit programme implementation. Other personnel costs for programme implementation (eg, time spent by Station Captains, probationary firefighters) were minimal, as their involvement rarely exceeded what was expected in their normal job tasks; these costs are excluded.

### Postoperative remote first care for financially and environmentally sustainable healthcare [^ef33ffe8]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Cost analysis

Model one (standard of care) resulted in a total financial cost (fC) of £9,541.75 for the whole patient group, and mean fC of £105.31 ± 41.5 (95% CI; 97.14–113.47) per patient. Using a RFS approach results in a mean fC per review of £45.13 ± 69.03 (95% CI 31.53–58.73), a reduction of £60.17 ± 42.98 (95% CI; 51.71–68.64, relative reduction 57.1%, p < 0. 001) per patient. Total fC would be £4,468.22 (relative reduction compared to face-to-face £5,073.53, 53.2%). Mean fC per review using RFT is £22.02 ± 40.58 (95% CI 14.03–30.02), a reduction of £83.29 ± 45.51 (95% CI; 74.32–92.25, relative reduction 87.0%, p < 0. 001) per patient. The total fC of applying RFT would be £2,180.22 (relative reduction compared to face-to-face £7,361.53, 77.2%).

Sensitivity analysis

As a sensitivity analysis, the mean (13.7 min) and median clinic review time (12.3 min) were varied within their respective 95% confidence intervals and applied to each model. The cost estimates ranged from £27.13–49.94 for RFS, and £12.92–26.02 for RFT (supplementary table 5). Mean (33.46 miles) and median (26.40 miles) patient travel distances were varied within their 95% confidence intervals and applied to each model for both cost and emissions estimates (Table 3).

### Time and distance cost of longer acting anti-VEGF therapies for macular degeneration: contributions to drug cost comparisons [^77bbe2b9]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

We acknowledge several limitations. The first and main limitation is that this study involves estimations based on nominal costs and listed assumptions but does not utilize cost and claims data. These calculations do not incorporate a comprehensive cost benefit analysis as has been done before. Instead, we aim to demonstrate the importance of incorporating time and distance costs of travel by using a simple model. We hope that by demonstrating this effect, we can drive future research to incorporate more comprehensive travel cost calculations in big data cost-effectiveness analyses. Second, this analysis was based on the assumption of time and distance cost data from a veterans affairs hospital in California. While this served as a helpful base for calculations, given the unique sponsorship of travel costs by the VA system, the specific time and distance cost calculations may not apply across all health systems and all states. Third, we use minimum wage as a blunt instrument to measure time value, however it is an imperfect way to measure the value of patient, family member, and caregiver time in the absence of self-reported wages for each patient and caregiver., In addition, as mentioned above, we present the time cost of travel in the results based on only the patient traveling to clinic visits, however, in reality, they would likely be accompanied by a family member or caregiver, significantly increasing the time cost of each clinic visit. There are many additional associated costs with clinic visits and injections frequency not considered in this analysis that would further amplify the cost benefit to the longer acting therapies. Furthermore, pharmaceutical companies offer numerous incentives and rebates to health systems and doctors, lowering the net cost of their drugs – these are not accounted for here and could well affect the ultimate analysis. In addition, this paper represents an objective estimation of travel costs according to travel reimbursement standards, however, these standards may become obsolete when fuel prices become prohibitive as occurring in instances of world instability. Finally, this study utilizes approved anti-VEGF therapies and therapeutic regimens for AMD, with the goal of focusing on the FDA on label regimens to allow for a direct like-for-like comparison. Future studies are needed to explore the effect of time and distance cost on different treatment arms that have been described as alternative regimens in the literature, such as in the EXCITE trial.

### Cost and logistics of alternative roll-out options for implementing human papillomavirus testing as a triage in cervical screening: results of the sentinel sites study [^85e8cfd5]. British Journal of Cancer (2012). Low credibility.

Cost comparison between 'hub and spoke model' and 'integrated cytology/HPV laboratory': administration, identifying samples/specimen reception and transport

Costs of the hub and spoke model were more expensive in part because of transport costs. Each centre sent samples for HPV testing to HPV laboratories twice a week. The average number of samples sent per journey was 14 (range 10–18). The cost per journey across centres varied from £5 to 50. Sentinel sites A and D were located at relatively close proximities to HPV laboratories (just under 50 km) compared with sites B and C (150–300 km). Sites A and D both incurred similar delivery costs – transporting up to 12 samples at a price of £5 per box and a larger box cost £25 to transport up to 40 samples. Sites B and C generally sent samples in a larger box that could contain 40 or more HPV samples at a cost of between £40 and 50 per box. The average transport costs per sample across the two sites located ∼50 km away were £0.44 (range £0.38 to 0.50). For those sites located further from the HPV processing laboratory (150–300 km), average transport costs per sample were higher at £2.76 (range £2.20–3.33; see Appendix Table A3).

The 'integrated HPV/Cytology' laboratory leads to lower total staff costs for administration, identifying samples/specimen reception than that of 'hub-and-spoke' model. The total staff administrative costs for the integrated laboratory were £1.04 compared with £3.14 for the integrated model. We also calculated the total staff cost excluding laboratory C where the timings were much higher than the other spoke laboratories and this lowered the total cost to £2.76.

Overall, with the 'hub-and-spoke' model staff and transportation costs ranged from £3.58 to 5.90 per sample depending on the transportation distance, the equivalent costs for the integrated laboratory were £1.04 (See Table 3). The integrated laboratory does not incur any cost for transporting samples.

### Vital signs: health burden and medical costs of nonfatal injuries to motor vehicle occupants-United States, 2012 [^9d1057da]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2014). Low credibility.

The lifetime medical cost of crash injuries was estimated to be $18.4 billion: $7.7 billion for treated and released patients and $10.7 billion for hospitalized patients (Table 2). The average lifetime medical cost per hospitalized patient was $56,674 (Table 2). The average lifetime medical cost per treated and released patient was $3,362 (Table 2). The lifetime cost of work loss because of crash injuries in 2012 was estimated to be $32.9 billion: $9.4 billion for treated and released patients, and $23.5 billion for hospitalized patients. Crash injuries declined in the past decade. Compared with 2002, an estimated 397,761 fewer ED visits and 5,771 fewer hospitalizations occurred in 2012. This reduction was associated with an averted $1.7 billion lifetime medical cost and $2.3 billion work loss costs.

### Uncrewed aircraft systems versus motorcycles to deliver laboratory samples in west Africa: a comparative economic study [^9647537f]. The Lancet: Global Health (2020). High credibility.

Summary

Background

Transportation of laboratory samples in low-income and middle-income countries is often constrained by poor road conditions, difficult geographical terrain, and insecurity. These constraints can lead to long turnaround times for laboratory diagnostic tests and hamper epidemic control or patient treatment efforts. Although uncrewed aircraft systems (UAS) — ie, drones — can mitigate some of these transportation constraints, their cost-effectiveness compared with land-based transportation systems is unclear.

Methods

We did a comparative economic study of the costs and cost-effectiveness of UAS versus motorcycles in Liberia (west Africa) for transportation of laboratory samples under simulated routine conditions and public health emergency conditions (based on the 2013–16 west African Ebola virus disease epidemic). We modelled three UAS with operational ranges of 30 km, 65 km, and 100 km (UAS30, UAS65, and UAS100) and lifespans of 1000 to 10 000 h, and compared the costs and number of samples transported with an established motorcycle transportation programme (most commonly used by the Liberian Ministry of Health and the charity Riders for Health). Data for UAS were obtained from Skyfire (a UAS consultancy), Vayu (a UAS manufacturer), and Sandia National Laboratories (a private company with UAS research experience). Motorcycle operational data were obtained from Riders for Health. In our model, we included costs for personnel, equipment, maintenance, and training, and did univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses for UAS lifespans, range, and accident or failures.

Findings

Under the routine scenario, the per sample transport costs were US$0·65 (95% CI 0·01–2·85) and $0·82 (0·56–5·05) for motorcycles and UAS65, respectively. Per-sample transport costs under the emergency scenario were $24·06 (95% CI 21·14–28·20) for motorcycles, $27·42 (95% CI 19·25–136·75) for an unadjusted UAS model with insufficient geographical coverage, and $34·09 (95% CI 26·70–127·40) for an adjusted UAS model with complementary motorcycles. Motorcycles were more cost-effective than short-range UAS (ie, UAS30). However, with increasing range and operational lifespans, UAS became increasingly more cost-effective.

Interpretation

Given the current level of technology, purchase prices, equipment lifespans, and operational flying ranges, UAS are not a viable option for routine transport of laboratory samples in west Africa. Field studies are required to generate evidence about UAS lifespan, failure rates, and performance under different weather conditions and payloads.

### Cost effectiveness of strategies to combat road traffic injuries in sub-saharan Africa and south east Asia: mathematical modelling study [^608d8608]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Results

Population level effect of interventions

The population level health gains associated with the five intervention strategies at target coverage levels (80%), alone and then in various combinations, are presented in table 2. Effectiveness results are expressed in terms of DALYs saved — or healthy life years gained — per million population per year of implementation. Because of the prominence of excessive speed and its negative consequences across all road user groups, enforcement of speed limits (via mobile cameras) is the single most effective strategy in the two sub-regions considered here (84 and 167 DALYs averted per million population per year in the South East Asian and African sub-regions, respectively). Legislation and enforcement of drink-driving laws also produce consistent gains in these populations (50–66% of the gain estimated for mobile speed cameras). Seatbelt laws and enforcement produce lower effects again (30–35% of the gain for mobile speed cameras). Unsurprisingly, legislation and enforcement of motorcycle helmet use has a relatively large impact in the South East Asian sub-region, with its heavy use of motorcycles, but only a modest impact in the African sub-region, where the motorcycle fleet is appreciably smaller. Assuming baseline effect sizes, legislation and enforcement of bicycle helmet use among children is among the most effective single strategies in the African setting, but has least impact on population health in the Asian context. The combined effect of implementing some or all the selected measures is also shown in table 2.

### Incentive-driven transition to high ride-sharing adoption [^da85716c]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

At locations with a low request rate s, the number of shared ride requests increases approximately linearly with more requests. Though even in the low demand limit, the ride-sharing adoption in New York City and Chicago, corresponding to the diagonal branches in Fig. 5 a, b, is below 100% (approximately 20% in New York City and 40% in Chicago). In terms of our ride-sharing game, the remaining fraction of requests for single rides may correspond to a user group with high relative importance of inconvenience compared to financial incentives, ϵ / ζ ≪ 1, or that otherwise does not consider sharing as an option. In this interpretation, the smaller value for New York City is consistent with a large fraction of high-income and business customers in Manhattan who likely place a higher value on convenience than financial incentives.

At higher request rates, sharing decisions differ by origin zone and split between low and partial sharing states (compare Fig. 1). In New York City (Fig. 5 a), Crown Heights North and East Village exhibit a relatively high ride-sharing adoption in line with that observed in low demand zones, indicating ϵ is sufficiently large to compensate the expected inconvenience and detour effects for a significant fraction of the users. Other origins with a similarly high request rate, such as JFK and LaGuardia airports, do not follow this trend and exhibit a smaller number of shared ride requests. In terms of our model, we expect thathas largely saturated in these zones and the given financial incentives do not outweigh the perceived inconvenience of ride-sharing. In particular at the airports, it seems plausible that financial incentives for ride-sharing are less important to users in the context of already costly plane tickets. In Chicago (Fig. 5 b), we find high-demand zones with an approximately constant number of shared ride requests, consistent with the low-sharing regime (horizontal branchin our model). In contrast, no zones with high demand show the same, relatively high ride-sharing adoption as zones with low demand. Some large downtown zones in Chicago with up to 50 requests per minute fall in the partial sharing regime expected for zones that effectively aggregate sharing decisions over a broad distribution of user preferences.

### An economic evaluation of health-promotive built environment changes [^42d757dc]. Preventive Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study aimed to help public investment decision makers see the greatest return on their built environment investments by developing an analysis framework for identifying the most promising improvement strategies and assessing the attainable return on investment.

Methods

The 2001 National Household Travel Survey sample (N = 4974) from Dane County, Wisconsin, was used to develop a Spatial Seemingly Unrelated Regression model of daily vehicle miles traveled and miles walked or biked. The empirical model was used to analyze the travel impacts of hypothetical built environment changes. These travel impacts were translated into health impacts and monetary values using cost-benefit analysis.

Results

Two win-win built environment strategies were found: increased regional retail accessibility and increased prevalence of sidewalks. Based on the present analyses, an investment of $450 million to make sidewalks available to all Dane County residents was estimated to yield a cost-benefit ratio of 1.87 over a 10-year life cycle.

Conclusion

Certain built environment measures could be predicted to be effective strategies for exerting a positive influence on people's travel behavior and the health of the community. Quantifiable public health benefits gained by better air quality and increased physical activity were shown to outweigh the cost of implementing the built environment measure of adding sidewalks to all roads.

### Economic determinants of urban form: resulting trade-offs between active and sedentary forms of travel [^ef82d98a]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Economic factors have an impact on how the built environment is shaped, which in turn affects how we choose to travel. Regional transportation investment decisions are firmly rooted in economic "cost-benefit" trade-off considerations. The placement (central or outlying) and mode of transportation in which investments are made (transit, highway, sidewalks, or bikeways) influence where homes, businesses, schools, and other types of uses are located. Transportation investments create or limit access and establish a set of economic trade-offs that help determine if an area will be compact or dispersed, and mixed use or single use. Developers consider cost trade-offs between constructing connected street grids versus disconnected cul-de-sac networks, which determines if residents can walk to services and transit. Taken collectively, transportation investments and resulting land-use patterns determine if destinations are far apart or close together and linked with direct and safe sidewalks or bikeways. The end result is a built environment that determines whether walking and biking is feasible or perceived as more beneficial than driving or taking transit. This paper assesses (1) the economic forces that shape transportation investment decisions, (2) the economic impact of these investments on land use, and (3) how we as consumers choose to travel as a result of these transportation investment and land-use decisions.

### Telemedicine and other care models in pediatric rheumatology: an exploratory study of parents' perceptions of barriers to care and care preferences [^6c4ad948]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Pairwise comparison revealed a statistically significant difference in arranging care for other children, with families whose child was less than six years old reporting a higher score (median 1.50, IQR 0.00–6.00) compared to families whose child was 13 years or older (0.00, 0.00–0.50; p = 0.016). Those with non-private insurance scored travel time/distance as a greater barrier than those with private insurance (median 3.75, IQR 0.75–5.50 vs 2.00, 0.50–5.00; p = 0.0398). Other pairwise comparisons between barrier scoring and patient factors (age, insurance, ethnicity, and diagnosis) revealed no significant differences.

Those who indicated travel as inconvenient vs convenient reported significantly greater difficulty with several barriers: travel time/distance (median 5.00, IQR 2.50–6.00 vs 1.00, 0.00–2.50; p < 0.0001), need for lodging/housing (0.25, 0.00–4.00 vs 0.00, 0.00–0.50; p = 0.0047), driving in the metropolitan (2.75, 0.00–5.00 vs 0.00, 0.00–1.00; p < 0.0001), indirect costs (2.50, 0.00–5.00 vs 0.00, 0.00–1.00; p < 0.0001), parent missing work (3.00, 1.00–6.00 vs 1.00, 0.00–3.00; p < 0.0001), child missing school (4.00, 1.25–6.25 vs 2.00, 0.50–3.50; p = 0.0008), and arranging care for other children (0.25, 0.00–5.00 vs 0.00, 0.00–0.50; p = 0.0219). The overall distribution of travel times was different depending on whether care was perceived as inconvenient vs convenient (p < 0.0001). For those reporting travel as convenient, 71% traveled an hour or less, 17% traveled more than an hour to 3 h or less, 10% traveled more than 3 h to 6 h or less, and 1% traveled more than 6 h. For those reporting travel as inconvenient, 18% traveled an hour or less, 34% more than an hour to 3 h or less, 37% more than 3 h to 6 h or less, and 11% more than 6 h.

### Uncrewed aircraft systems versus motorcycles to deliver laboratory samples in west Africa: a comparative economic study [^efade439]. The Lancet: Global Health (2020). High credibility.

Background

Transportation of laboratory samples in low-income and middle-income countries is often constrained by poor road conditions, difficult geographical terrain, and insecurity. These constraints can lead to long turnaround times for laboratory diagnostic tests and hamper epidemic control or patient treatment efforts. Although uncrewed aircraft systems (UAS)-ie, drones-can mitigate some of these transportation constraints, their cost-effectiveness compared with land-based transportation systems is unclear.

Methods

We did a comparative economic study of the costs and cost-effectiveness of UAS versus motorcycles in Liberia (west Africa) for transportation of laboratory samples under simulated routine conditions and public health emergency conditions (based on the 2013–16 west African Ebola virus disease epidemic). We modelled three UAS with operational ranges of 30 km, 65 km, and 100 km (UAS30, UAS65, and UAS100) and lifespans of 1000 to 10000 h, and compared the costs and number of samples transported with an established motorcycle transportation programme (most commonly used by the Liberian Ministry of Health and the charity Riders for Health). Data for UAS were obtained from Skyfire (a UAS consultancy), Vayu (a UAS manufacturer), and Sandia National Laboratories (a private company with UAS research experience). Motorcycle operational data were obtained from Riders for Health. In our model, we included costs for personnel, equipment, maintenance, and training, and did univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses for UAS lifespans, range, and accident or failures.

Findings

Under the routine scenario, the per sample transport costs were US$0·65 (95% CI 0·01–2·85) and $0·82 (0·56–5·05) for motorcycles and UAS65, respectively. Per-sample transport costs under the emergency scenario were $24·06 (95% CI 21·14–28·20) for motorcycles, $27·42 (95% CI 19·25–136·75) for an unadjusted UAS model with insufficient geographical coverage, and $34·09 (95% CI 26·70–127·40) for an adjusted UAS model with complementary motorcycles. Motorcycles were more cost-effective than short-range UAS (ie, UAS30). However, with increasing range and operational lifespans, UAS became increasingly more cost-effective.

Interpretation

Given the current level of technology, purchase prices, equipment lifespans, and operational flying ranges, UAS are not a viable option for routine transport of laboratory samples in west Africa. Field studies are required to generate evidence about UAS lifespan, failure rates, and performance under different weather conditions and payloads.

Funding

None.

### Speed enforcement detection devices for preventing road traffic injuries [^db37851d]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

It is estimated that by 2020, road traffic crashes will have moved from ninth to third in the world ranking of burden of disease, as measured in disability adjusted life years. The identification of effective strategies for the prevention of road traffic injuries is of global public health importance. Measures aimed at reducing traffic speed are considered essential to preventing road injuries; the use of speed enforcement detection devices (including speed cameras and radar and laser devices) is one such measure.

Objectives

To assess whether the use of speed enforcement detection devices (SEDs) reduces the incidence of speeding, road traffic crashes, injuries and deaths.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Injuries Group's Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science (and Social Science) Citation Index, TRANSPORT, PsycINFO, CINAHL, EconLit. We searched the websites of road safety and motoring associations, as well as general internet searches. We handsearched selected journals and conference proceedings, and contacted experts in the field. The searches were conducted during May to November 2004.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials and controlled before-after studies that assessed the impact of speed enforcement detection devices on speeding, road crashes, injuries and deaths were eligible for inclusion. For studies involving co-interventions, SEDs had to be the major intervention focus of the study to be eligible.

Data Collection and Analysis

We independently screened search results, assessed studies for inclusion, extracted data and assessed methodological quality. Due to variability between and within included studies, a pooled analysis was not appropriate.

Main Results

No randomised controlled trials were identified. Twenty-six studies met the inclusion criteria, of which 22 were controlled before-after trials incorporating a distinct control or comparison group(s) and four were interrupted time series designs with a comparison group(s). Fourteen studies reported speed and crash outcomes, seven reported crash outcomes only and five reported speed outcomes only. All but one study reported an absolute reduction in pre/post average speeds. A pre/post reduction in the proportion of speeding vehicles ranged across studies from 5% to 70% depending on the speed threshold set. Pre/post reductions of 50% to 65% were reported in the proportion of speeding vehicles travelling > 15 km/h over the speed limit. Compared with controls, the relative improvement was from 1% to 15% for average speed and from 14% to 65% for percent speeding. All studies reporting crash outcomes reported an absolute pre/post reduction in all crashes and injury related crashes. In the vicinity of camera sites these pre/post reductions ranged from 14% to 72% for all crashes, 8% to 46% for injury crashes, and 40% to 45% for crashes resulting in fatalities or serious injuries. More generalised effects over wider areas showed an absolute pre/post crash reduction ranging from 9% to 35%, 7% to 30% for all injury crashes and 13% to 58% for crashes resulting in fatalities alone, or in combination with serious injuries. The studies of longer duration showed that these positive trends were either maintained or improved with time. Compared with controls, the relative improvement in pre/post crash numbers resulting in any type of injury ranged from 5% to 36%.

Authors' Conclusions

Despite the methodological limitations of the studies reviewed, the consistency of reported positive reductions in speed and crash outcomes across all studies suggest that SEDs are a promising intervention for reducing the number of road traffic injuries and deaths. More studies of a scientifically rigorous nature are necessary to provide a stronger evidence base that these interventions are worthwhile. There is a need for international harmonisation of data collection methods, including standards on how best to measure speeds and collect crash data, over lengthy intervention and follow-up periods, as well as some consensus as to the expression of outcomes in studies, so that studies can be compared.

### The catastrophic cost of motorcycle road traffic injuries: experience from a major reference centre in a lower-middle income country [^fbcde7e3]. Injury (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Motorcycle crashes are an increasing public health problem in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). An accurate estimation of the economic burden of these crashes could be complex owing to a prevalent system of out-of-pocket (OOP) payment for health care services in these countries. Our study aims to objectively evaluate the cost implication of motorcycle Road Traffic Injuries (RTIs) among road crash victims managed at a major trauma reference hospital in Nigeria. Two economic evaluation methods were used to accurately reflect the cost-of-care (C-o-C) of each victim as well as for cross-validation.

Method

This is a prospective cohort study conducted between August 2020 and May 2021. All patients involved in motorcycle road traffic crashes presenting to the Emergency Department of the University College Hospital, Ibadan, Nigeria, were included in the study. For each patient, all medical expenses from the time of injury (T 0) to 30 days after injury (T 30) or Time to death (T D) - whichever occurred first, were valued in costs, and added (Activity-based costing or ABC), while also estimating overall cost-of-care (C-o-C) at T 30 or T D, using the willingness-to-pay (WTP) method. Following the WHO definition, catastrophic expenditure was defined as expenditure > 25% of the patient's estimated annual household income.

Results

Of the 150 consecutively managed motorcycle crashes victims during the study period, 112 had complete data. The median monthly household income for the cohort was $121 with 75% of them earning less than $180. The median cost-of-care (C-o-C), by ABC, was $242 ($143–828). For individual care items, expenditure on surgical intervention(s) was the highest followed by prosthesis and implant procurement, and radiological investigations. On the other hand, the estimated medical cost was $2356 (IQR $938–6475) by WTP. Only 14% had health insurance coverage. The overall expenditure was catastrophic for 46% of the patients. Monthly household income of < $180 (AOR = 9.2; 95% CI = 2.6–32.8; p < 0.001), absence of health insurance coverage (AOR = 10.7; 95% CI = 1.1–101.6; p = 0.040), and prolonged hospital stay above 14 days (AOR = 25.1; 95% CI = 5.5–115.1; p = 0.001) were predictors of catastrophic expenditure. There was a weak positive correlation between actual cost-of-care using the ABC method and WTP (r = 0.247; p = 0.102).

Conclusion

The aggregate cost of motorcycle RTIs is catastrophic for nearly half of the victims attending the University College Hospital, Ibadan. The willingness-to-pay method, though less tedious is often less reliable in these settings owing to a prevalent OOP payment system. This study identified the need to implement effective financial protection mechanisms against the high OOP expenditure faced by motorcycle crash victims in LMICs.

### State-level economic costs of fatal injuries-United States, 2019 [^05268434]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2021). Medium credibility.

The economic cost estimate for injuries that occurred in 2019 uses the societal perspective, including tangible and intangible costs to multiple payers. Costs are presented in 2019 U.S. dollars (USD). WISQARS fatal injury counts are from CDC's National Vital Statistics System mortality data. In 2019, approximately 70% of U.S. injury deaths (173,040) were attributable to unintentional injuries (among which 36% were related to drug poisoning, 23% to falls, and 22% to motor vehicle traffic); approximately 20% were suicides; and 8% were homicides. Medical costs were adjusted for patient characteristics, including comorbidities, sex, and age, and were modified to 2019 USD and assigned to WISQARS records by injury mechanism (e.g. fall), intent (e.g. unintentional), and place of death (e.g. inpatient hospital). Aggregated medical costs (e.g. combined intents by mechanism or combined mechanisms by place of death) from reference sources were assigned when specific estimates by intent or mechanism were not available. The average medical cost among 2019 injury deaths was approximately $15,400 ††; however, many injury deaths had lower costs because the deaths occurred outside a health care setting.

The cost of injury mortality includes value of statistical life, a monetary estimate of the collective value that persons place on mortality risk reduction as derived in research studies through revealed preferences (e.g. observed wage differences for dangerous occupations) or stated preferences from surveys of persons' willingness to pay for mortality risk reduction. Value of statistical life estimates were assigned by decedent age: 0–17 years, $16.9 million; 18–65 years, $10.7 million; values descending from $6 million (aged 66 years) to $410,000 (aged ≥ 100 years), reflecting the estimate for persons aged 18–65 years adjusted for older adults' decreasing general life expectancy and baseline quality of life. Per capita fatal injury costs by U.S. state are presented graphically by injury intent (Figure). Injury fatality rates by state, intent, sex, and age group (0–24 years, 25–64 years, and ≥ 65 years) were examined to better understand the contributing circumstances in states with the highest per capita total injury costs. All reported data can be queried online using WISQARS. This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy. §§

### Access to certified burn centers in the United States: the geospatial and transport cost of transfer [^e59943a8]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Specialized burn centers are critical to minimizing burn-associated morbidity and mortality. However, American Burn Association-verified burn centers are unequally distributed across the United States, and fewer centers are available for pediatric patients relative to adults. The economic burden of transporting patients to these centers contributes significantly to the high cost of burn care. This study quantifies inequitable burn care access in the contiguous United States due to age group and location as a function of physical proximity to a verified burn center and transportation cost. County-level distances to the nearest verified adult or pediatric burn center were determined and mapped. Distance calculations for each population were combined with transport cost data (2022 CMS Ambulance Fee Schedules) to estimate transportation costs for each population (adult vs pediatric, urban vs rural). Pediatric patients reside 30.5 miles further than adults from the nearest center, significantly increasing transportation costs. Ground and air transport costs also increased for rural versus urban patients. Notably, rural patients face almost double the cost of air transport. While physical proximity to burn care appears to differ only modestly across age and region, this marginal increase in distance is associated with significant economic impact. This study highlights physical and economic barriers to burn care access faced by rural and pediatric patients and underscores the critical need to improve equity in burn care access. Future studies should expand on this report's findings to more fully characterize the additional costs associated with inequitable burn care access.

### Providing cardiology care in rural areas through visiting consultant clinics [^2495b555]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

A high proportion of cardiology VCC clinics days (72%) were staffed by Iowa physicians (105 clinics). One hundred (100) cardiologists from Iowa participated in a VCC in 2014. Based on the overall number of cardiologists practicing in Iowa in 2014 (N = 222), 45% are involved in rural outreach activities. In addition, 67 cardiologists from adjoining states also staffed cardiology VCCs in Iowa in 2014.

Participation in VCC outreach was marginally related to sex (male VCC participation = 47%, female VCC participation = 32%, P < 0.11) and unrelated to physician age (participating = 52.7 ± 9.9 years, nonparticipating = 52.3 ± 12.4 years, P < 0.83) or self‐identified specialty (cardiovascular medicine VCC participation = 47%, clinical cardiac electrophysiology VCC participation = 40%, interventional cardiology VCC participation = 29%, P < 0.37).

Figure 1 contains a map of the primary practice sites and VCC sites in 2014. This map shows the locations of the VCCs and the primary practice locations of the participating cardiologists. The different colored lines are intended to help the reader distinguish between VCCs originating from different cities.

Figure 1
Locations of cardiologys and primary practice locations of involved physicians (2014). VCCs indicates visiting consultant clinics.

The mean 1‐way (estimated) driving distance for all cardiologists participating in VCC activity is 46.5 ± 18.6 miles. For non‐Iowa physicians, the comparable figure is 65.5 ± 20.7 miles. This difference is significant (t = 5.00, P < 0.001).

Based on the estimated number of visits per month and driving distance, cardiologists from Iowa and adjoining states drive 45 813 miles per month to staff rural outreach clinics. On a yearly basis, the direct cost of travel to VCC sites is $307 865 per year (= 549 759 miles per year×$0.56 per mile).

Assuming that only 1 cardiologist staffs each VCC day, total travel time for all VCCs in 2014 added up to a total of 10 939 hours at $168.75 per hour. The estimated yearly opportunity costs associated with travel to rural VCC sites is $1 845 956.

### American cancer society guideline for diet and physical activity for cancer prevention [^bae8a166]. CA (2020). High credibility.

Built environment and active transportation — The built environment can support efforts especially designed to increase weekly amounts of physical activity through active travel, and approaches that increase walking or bicycle transportation in a community are effective in increasing both transportation-related and recreational physical activity as well as total walking time. Communities should include policies or initiatives designed to create or enhance mixed land use environments that increase the diversity and proximity of local destinations where people live, work, and spend their recreation and leisure time, and such initiatives require shared values and synergistic efforts from communities, including community members, community planners, health professionals, transportation officials, and governments. Transportation system interventions that are designed to increase (or improve) street connectivity; sidewalk, bicycle, and trail infrastructure; and public transit structure and access have proven effective in this regard.

### Financial improvements from short course adjuvant vaginal cuff brachytherapy in early endometrial cancer compared with standard of care, "SAVE" trial [^b6f7a243]. Practical Radiation Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Early-stage endometrial cancer is often treated with hysterectomy followed by adjuvant vaginal cuff brachytherapy (VCB). Financial toxicity from cancer treatment can impact treatment completion. The Short Course Adjuvant Vaginal Cuff Brachytherapy in Early Endometrial Cancer Compared to Standard of Care trial is a multicenter, prospective randomized trial of standard of care (SoC) VCB doses delivered in 3 to 5 fractions per the physician's discretion compared with a 2-fraction course. We report on secondary cost endpoints, quantifying the financial impacts of shorter treatment courses on institutions and participating patients.

Methods and Materials

Technical (TechCs), professional, and total charges (TotCs) were collected prospectively and are reported as raw and Medicare-adjusted charges per patient. Distance to the treatment center and the median income for each patient's zip code were estimated. The Mann-Whitney U statistic, t test, and X 2 test were used to compare characteristics between the 2 groups.

Results

One hundred eight patients were analyzed. SoC VCB was delivered in 3, 4, and 5 fractions for 27 of 54 patients (50%), 11 of 54 (20%), and 16 of 54 (30%), respectively. The median total distance traveled per patient for SoC versus experimental arms was 213 versus 137 miles (p = .12), and the median cost of commute for patients was $36.3 versus $18.0 (p = .11). Compared with 2-fraction treatment, 5-fraction treatment resulted in longer travel distances (median, 462 vs 137 miles; p < .01) and increased travel costs (median, $59.3 vs $18.0; p ≤ .01). Unadjusted raw professional charges in USD per patient did not differ between SoC versus experimental arms ($9159 vs $7532; p = .19). TechCs were significantly higher in the SoC arm ($35,734 vs $24,696; p ≤ .01), as were TotCs ($44,892 vs $32,228; p < .01;). Medicare-adjusted TechCs and TotCs were higher for the SoC arm.

Conclusions

Two-fraction VCB resulted in fewer treatments per patient, reduced cost of travel compared with longer courses, and an adjusted reduction in health care expenditures compared with SoC.

### Japanese encephalitis vaccine: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices [^5d258344]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2019). High credibility.

Cost-effectiveness of Japanese encephalitis (JE) vaccines in U.S. travelers — A comparative analysis defined group 1 as higher-risk travelers who planned to spend ≥ 1 month in JE-endemic areas, group 2 as travelers who would spend < 1 month in JE-endemic areas with at least 20% of their time participating in outdoor activities in rural areas, and group 3 as the remainder of shorter-term and lower-risk U.S. travelers to Asia, with an analytic horizon of 6 years. To prevent one JE case, the number of travelers who would need to be vaccinated was 0.7 million, 1.6 million, and 9.8 million in groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively, and the total cost to prevent one case from a societal perspective was approximately $0.6 billion, $1.3 billion, and $7.9 billion for each group. The variable with the greatest influence on cost-effectiveness was disease incidence among travelers; increasing baseline incidence 100 times yielded travelers needed to be vaccinated of 7,000, 16,000, and 98,000 in groups 1–3 with cost per case averted of $5 million, $12 million, and $78 million, and the analysis supported focusing on vaccination of travelers at increased risk for disease compared with those at lower risk.

### Cost-effectiveness of neighbourhood slow zones in New York city [^d8916149]. Injury Prevention (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Neighbourhood slow zones (NSZs) are areas that attempt to slow traffic via speed limits coupled with other measures (eg, speed humps). They appear to reduce traffic crashes and encourage active transportation. We evaluate the cost-effectiveness of NSZs in New York City (NYC), which implemented them in 2011.

Methods

We examined the effectiveness of NSZs in NYC using data from the city's Department of Transportation in an interrupted time series analysis. We then conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis using a Markov model. One-way sensitivity analyses and Monte Carlo analyses were conducted to test error in the model.

Results

After 2011, road casualties in NYC fell by 8.74% (95% CI 1.02% to 16.47%) in the NSZs but increased by 0.31% (95% CI -3.64% to 4.27%) in the control neighbourhoods. Because injury costs outweigh intervention costs, NSZs resulted in a net savings of US$15 (95% credible interval: US$2 to US$43) and a gain of 0.002 of a quality-adjusted life year (QALY, 95% credible interval: 0.001 to 0.006) over the lifetime of the average NSZ resident relative to no intervention. Based on the results of Monte Carlo analyses, there was a 97.7% chance that the NSZs fall under US$50000 per QALY gained.

Conclusion

While additional causal models are needed, NSZs appeared to be an effective and cost-effective means of reducing road casualties. Our models also suggest that NSZs may save more money than they cost.

### Motorcycle taxi programme increases safe riding behaviours among its drivers in Kampala, Uganda [^010da112]. Injury Prevention (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

SafeBoda is a motorcycle taxi company that provides road safety training and helmets to its drivers in Kampala, Uganda. We sought to determine whether SafeBoda drivers are more likely to engage in safe riding behaviours than regular drivers (motorcycle taxi drivers not part of SafeBoda). METHODS: We measured riding behaviours in SafeBoda and regular drivers through: (1) computer-assisted personal interview (CAPI), where 400 drivers were asked about their riding behaviours (eg, helmet and mobile phone use) and (2) roadside observation, where riding behaviours were observed in 3000 boda-boda drivers and their passengers along major roads in Kampala.

Results

Across the two cross-sectional studies, a higher proportion of SafeBoda drivers than regular drivers engaged in safe riding behaviours. For instance, helmet use among SafeBoda compared with regular drivers was 21%points higher (95%CI 0.15 to 0.27; p < 0.001) based on the CAPI and 45% points higher (95%CI 0.43 to 0.47; p < 0.001) based on roadside observation. Furthermore, compared with regular drivers, SafeBoda drivers were more likely to report having a driver's license (66.3% vs 33.5%; p < 0.001) and a reflective jacket (99.5% vs 50.5%; p < 0.001) and were less likely to report driving towards oncoming traffic (4% vs 45.7%; p < 0.001) in the past 30 days.

Conclusion

The SafeBoda programme is associated with increased safe riding behaviours among motorcycle taxi drivers in Kampala. Therefore, the promotion and expansion of such programmes may lead to a reduction in morbidity and mortality due to road injuries.

### Parks, trails, and greenways for physical activity: a community guide systematic economic review [^3eea11af]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

This systematic economic review examined the cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness of park, trail, and greenway infrastructure interventions to increase physical activity or infrastructure use.

Methods

The search period covered the date of inception of publications databases through February 2022. Inclusion was limited to studies that reported cost-benefit or cost-effectiveness outcomes and were based in the U.S. and other high-income countries. Analyses were conducted from March 2022 through December 2022. All monetary values reported are in 2021 U.S. dollars.

Results

The search yielded 1 study based in the U.S. and 7 based in other high-income countries, with 1 reporting cost-effectiveness and 7 reporting cost-benefit outcomes. The cost-effectiveness study based in the United Kingdom reported $23,254 per disability-adjusted life year averted. The median benefit-to-cost ratio was 3.1 (interquartile interval = 2.9–3.9) on the basis of 7 studies.

Discussion

The evidence shows that economic benefits exceed the intervention cost of park, trail, and greenway infrastructure. Given large differences in the size of infrastructure, intervention costs and economic benefits varied substantially across studies. There was insufficient number of studies to determine the cost-effectiveness of these interventions.

### Association of cost-driven residential moves with health-related outcomes among California renters [^91117f7f]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Comparison With Non–Cost-Driven Moving

General health, distress, and walking for leisure were also significantly worse among those who made cost-driven moves relative to those who made non–cost-driven moves (Figure 2). Participants who made cost-driven moves were less likely to report having good, very good, or excellent general health (adjusted difference, −4.6 [95% CI, −2.1 to −7.2] percentage points); more likely to report experiencing moderate psychological distress (adjusted difference, 3.2 [95% CI, 1.7 to 4.7] percentage points); and more likely to report experiencing severe psychological distress (adjusted difference, 2.5 [95% CI, 1.2 to 3.9] percentage points) compared with people who made non–cost-driven moves. Those who made cost-driven moves also walked 13.0 (95% CI, 4.0–21.9) fewer minutes per week for leisure. The likelihood of having preventive care visits (adjusted difference, −2.7 [95% CI, −6.2 to 0.7] percentage points) and ED visits (adjusted difference, −1.4 [95% CI, −3.9 to 1.1] percentage points) did not differ between those who made cost-driven vs non–cost-driven moves.

Figure 2.
Adjusted Associations Between Cost-Driven Residential Moves and Health-Related Outcomes Relative to Non–Cost-Driven Residential Moves

Unweighted sample sizes are shown; all other values represent weighted estimates. Adjusted outcomes for no move represent the reference values. Average marginal effects are shown in the forest plot, with 95% CIs indicated by whiskers. All models were adjusted for sex, race and ethnicity, family composition, age, age squared, employment status, educational attainment, income, housing type, urbanicity, limited English language proficiency, citizenship, and survey year. Preventive care visit and ED visit models were also adjusted for health insurance type. ED indicates emergency department.

Sensitivity Analyses

Patterns of associations with health-related outcomes were consistent when the primary exposure was formulated more broadly as housing-related moves (eTable 4 in Supplement 1). Slightly attenuated estimates in these models suggested that this broad category likely captured a more heterogeneous group of movers. For alternate outcome specifications, we observed consistent associations between cost-driven moves and adverse health-related outcomes, but some models had greater imprecision (eTable 5 in Supplement 1).

### The impact of proposed changes in liver allocation policy on cold ischemia times and organ transportation costs [^0ccbfe4b]. American Journal of Transplantation (2015). Low credibility.

Changes to the liver allocation system have been proposed to decrease regional variation in access to liver transplant. It is unclear what impact these changes will have on cold ischemia times (CITs) and donor transportation costs. Therefore, we performed a retrospective single center study (2008–2012) measuring liver procurement CIT and transportation costs. Four groups were defined: Local-within driving distance (Local-D, n = 262), Local-flight (Local-F, n = 105), Regional-flight < 3h (Regional < 3h, n = 61) and Regional-Flight > 3h (Regional > 3h, n = 53). The median travel distance increased in each group, varying from zero miles (Local-D), 196 miles (Local-F), 384 miles (Regional < 3h), to 1647 miles (Regional > 3h). Increasing travel distances did not significantly increase CIT until the flight time was > 3h. The average CIT ranged from 5.0 to 6.0h for Local-D, Local-F and Regional < 3h, but increased to 10h for Regional > 3h (p < 0.0001). Transportation costs increased with greater distance traveled: Local-D $101, Local-F $1993, Regional < 3h $8324 and Regional > 3h $27810 (p < 0.0001). With proposed redistricting, local financial modeling suggests that the average liver donor procurement transportation variable direct costs will increase from $2415 to $7547/liver donor, an increase of 313%. These findings suggest that further discussion among transplant centers and insurance providers is needed prior to policy implementation.

### Bicycle weight and commuting time: randomised trial [^5924f4c1]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Objective To determine whether the author's 20.9 lb (9.5 kg) carbon frame bicycle reduced commuting time compared with his 29.75 lb (13.5 kg) steel frame bicycle.

Design Randomised trial.

Setting Sheffield and Chesterfield, United Kingdom, between mid-January 2010 and mid-July 2010.

Participants One consultant in anaesthesia and intensive care.

Main outcome measure Total time to complete the 27 mile (43.5 kilometre) journey from Sheffield to Chesterfield Royal Hospital and back.

Results The total distance travelled on the steel frame bicycle during the study period was 809 miles (1302 km) and on the carbon frame bicycle was 711 miles (1144 km). The difference in the mean journey time between the steel and carbon bicycles was 00:00:32 (hr:min:sec; 95% CI –00:03:34 to 00:02:30; P = 0.72).

Conclusions A lighter bicycle did not lead to a detectable difference in commuting time. Cyclists may find it more cost effective to reduce their own weight rather than to purchase a lighter bicycle.
