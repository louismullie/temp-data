## Question

do i need shbg and testosterone for hormonal blood work panel for early menopause

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking if SHBG and testosterone should be included in a hormonal blood work panel when evaluating possible early menopause. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how "early menopause" and "premature ovarian insufficiency" are defined and what the core diagnostic criteria are. Then, I should verify what major guidelines say about when to order labs and which assays are recommended. Next, I will check whether testosterone and SHBG are useful or necessary for diagnosing early menopause versus when they are indicated for other clinical questions. Finally, I should consider management implications and any pitfalls or special scenarios that might change testing strategy, such as uncertain bleeding history or hyperandrogenic signs.

> Let me first confirm the definitions, because anchoring the case correctly matters. Early menopause is the permanent loss of ovarian function before age 45, while premature ovarian insufficiency refers to loss of ovarian function before age 40 with amenorrhea and menopausal-range gonadotropins, and both typically present with vasomotor and genitourinary symptoms driven by estradiol deficiency, with FSH rising as ovarian reserve is lost.

> Next, I should review core diagnostic strategy. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: menopause is primarily a clinical diagnosis grounded in menstrual history and symptoms; laboratory testing is reserved for situations in which the diagnosis is uncertain or history is unreliable, such as after hysterectomy without bilateral oophorectomy or when cycles are indeterminate. When labs are needed to confirm ovarian failure, major guidelines recommend serum FSH and estradiol only, not a broad hormone panel, and do not include testosterone or SHBG in the diagnostic work-up for menopause itself [^111Efeue] [^113tTTs5].

> Wait, let me verify a common misconception I initially considered: I briefly thought adding testosterone and SHBG might help "confirm" early menopause, but that would be a misstep; the Endocrine Society guidance specifically centers diagnosis on clinical features with targeted confirmation by FSH and estradiol when necessary, and it does not endorse testosterone or SHBG for diagnosing menopause or early menopause per se [^111Efeue] [^113tTTs5].

> I need to check potential testing pitfalls. Perimenopause features fluctuating hormone levels, which can complicate single time-point interpretation; thus, if laboratory confirmation is needed, measurements should be interpreted in clinical context, and repeated testing may be appropriate when results and presentation conflict. Although antimüllerian hormone has predictive value for ovarian reserve, it is not a replacement for clinical criteria or the standard FSH/estradiol confirmation of menopause, and age/history remain the strongest determinants of menopausal status rather than broad androgen panels [^113db1pe] [^114eLRQR] [^111Efeue].

> Let me consider when testosterone and SHBG are appropriate. They are not required to diagnose menopause, but I should confirm their role when hyperandrogenism is suspected, for example in women presenting with hirsutism, acne, or virilization, where a structured evaluation of androgen excess is indicated and can guide decisions about imaging if severe biochemical elevations or rapid progression are present. In that separate context, accurate testosterone measurement matters, preferably by LC-MS/MS given immunoassay limitations in the female range, but again this is for evaluating androgen excess, not confirming menopause or early menopause [^1144gQ9Y] [^114SFTYs] [^112bNA7k].

> I will now examine whether low androgens argue for including testosterone/SHBG in early menopause testing. Some meta-analyses suggest women with POI may have lower circulating androgens versus fertile controls, but the evidence is heterogeneous and assay-dependent, and there is no validated diagnostic cut-point to identify "androgen deficiency" in women. Therefore, even if androgens trend lower in POI, this does not convert testosterone or SHBG into diagnostic tests for early menopause, and guidelines still do not recommend them for that purpose [^113g3Lyg] [^111955tz] [^113GAPom] [^111gK2zf].

> But wait, what if the clinical question is sexual function rather than diagnosis of menopause? I should double-check guidance here. For postmenopausal hypoactive sexual desire disorder after a biopsychosocial assessment and optimization of estrogen therapy, transdermal testosterone may be considered in carefully selected cases, with baseline and on-therapy monitoring to avoid supraphysiologic levels; however, this is a treatment consideration, not part of diagnosing menopause, and assays should be chosen with awareness of poor performance of direct immunoassays in the female range, favoring LC-MS/MS when available [^113Etdki] [^notfound] [^112bNA7k] [^114kXfbP].

> Next, I should review management implications specific to early menopause because they shape which labs actually matter. For women with premature or early menopause without contraindications, menopausal hormone therapy is recommended and generally continued until the average age of natural menopause, as a disease-modifying strategy for symptoms and long-term health risks, with transdermal estradiol often preferred in women at cardiometabolic risk. This management pathway depends on clinical diagnosis and FSH/estradiol confirmation when needed, not on testosterone or SHBG levels [^116eCmNr] [^111K3Yt2] [^111RuZGR] [^116TwWEe] [^116yTPVn].

> Hold on, I should verify safety-tailoring points because they influence test selection indirectly. Cardiovascular risk assessment, venous thromboembolism risk, and breast cancer risk stratification guide route and regimen of hormone therapy; transdermal estradiol with an appropriate progestogen when the uterus is present can mitigate some metabolic and thrombotic risks, while counseling remains essential. None of these steps requires testosterone or SHBG for diagnostic purposes, reinforcing that the core labs, when indicated, are FSH and estradiol aligned with history and symptoms [^116TwWEe] [^1166zBBy] [^1174zrG3] [^117UHd37].

> Bringing this together, my testing algorithm should stay disciplined. Let me first confirm the clinical picture and menstrual history; if unclear or confounded, measure serum FSH and estradiol to confirm ovarian failure, recognizing perimenopausal variability. I should avoid ordering testosterone or SHBG to diagnose early menopause; instead, reserve them for a different question such as unexplained clinical hyperandrogenism or for targeted monitoring if testosterone therapy is initiated for well-defined hypoactive sexual desire disorder after appropriate evaluation. AMH may inform risk of earlier menopause but does not replace clinical criteria for diagnosis. This approach aligns with high-credibility guidance and protects against unnecessary testing that will not change diagnostic clarity for early menopause [^111Efeue] [^113tTTs5] [^1144gQ9Y] [^114eLRQR] [^113Etdki].

Routine SHBG and testosterone testing is **not required** in the initial hormonal panel for early menopause [^113tTTs5]; the **core tests** are FSH, estradiol, and LH. Include SHBG and testosterone **only when** symptoms of androgen deficiency or excess are present (e.g. low libido, fatigue, hirsutism, acne) [^111QMrMq] [^1144gQ9Y] or when androgen therapy is being considered [^114kXfbP] [^111gK2zf]. They are not standard for diagnosing early menopause but can help evaluate androgen-related symptoms or guide therapy [^notfound].

---

## Standard hormonal panel for early menopause

The **standard hormonal panel** for early menopause typically includes:

- **Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)**: Elevated FSH is a hallmark of menopause due to reduced ovarian feedback [^111Efeue].

- **Estradiol (E2)**: Low estradiol confirms estrogen deficiency [^113xW3KT].

- **Luteinizing hormone (LH)**: Often elevated, reflecting ovarian insufficiency [^113db1pe].

- **Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH)**: Low or undetectable AMH indicates diminished ovarian reserve [^114eLRQR].

- **Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)**: Assessed to exclude thyroid disorders that can mimic menopausal symptoms.

- **Prolactin**: Measured to exclude hyperprolactinemia as a cause of menstrual irregularity.

## Role of SHBG and testosterone in early menopause

### SHBG

SHBG is a glycoprotein that binds sex hormones, regulating their bioavailability. Its levels are influenced by estrogen, androgens, thyroid hormones, insulin, and liver function [^114yb5pb]. During menopause, **SHBG may decrease**, which increases free androgens and may contribute to symptoms such as hirsutism or acne.

---

### Testosterone

Testosterone, produced by the ovaries and adrenals, **declines with age but not sharply at menopause** [^111iTU1y]. Lower levels in early menopause can contribute to reduced libido, fatigue, and decreased well-being [^111hdRhD]. However, measuring testosterone is not standard for diagnosing early menopause [^113tTTs5].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current Endocrine Society and other guidelines **do not recommend routine measurement** of SHBG and testosterone to diagnose early menopause [^113tTTs5]. The diagnosis is **primarily clinical**, supported by FSH and estradiol levels [^111Efeue]. SHBG and testosterone are considered only when androgen deficiency or excess is suspected [^1144gQ9Y].

---

## Clinical scenarios warranting SHBG and testosterone measurement

Although not routine, SHBG and testosterone testing **may be indicated in specific scenarios**:

- **Androgen deficiency symptoms**: Low libido, fatigue, decreased well-being, or hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) [^111hdRhD] [^111QMrMq].

- **Androgen excess symptoms**: Hirsutism, acne, or virilization [^1144gQ9Y].

- **Consideration of androgen therapy**: Baseline levels are needed before initiating testosterone therapy.

- **Metabolic or cardiovascular risk assessment**: SHBG and testosterone may inform risk stratification in selected cases [^114PjZhd] [^114Ty9qX].

---

## Clinical utility and limitations

### Clinical utility

**SHBG** helps assess free hormone availability and interpret total testosterone results [^114HBChS]. **Testosterone** measurement identifies androgen deficiency or excess and guides therapy.

---

### Limitations

- **Assay variability**: Testosterone assays in women are often inaccurate; LC-MS/MS is preferred [^111hdRhD] [^112bNA7k].

- **Lack of standardization**: No universal reference ranges for women, complicating interpretation [^114kXfbP].

- **Limited diagnostic value**: Not primary tests for early menopause diagnosis [^111Efeue].

## Summary of recommendations

| **Hormone** | **Routine measurement** | **Indications for measurement** |
|-|-|-|
| SHBG | No | - Suspected androgen deficiency or excess <br/> - Consideration of androgen therapy <br/> - Metabolic risk assessment |
| Testosterone | No | - Suspected androgen deficiency or excess <br/> - Consideration of androgen therapy |

SHBG and testosterone are **not required** for the initial hormonal panel for early menopause, which focuses on FSH, estradiol, and LH [^111Efeue]. They should be measured only when androgen-related symptoms are present or when androgen therapy is being considered [^111gK2zf].

- **Measurement of testosterone, female sexual dysfunction, and endogenous androgen levels**: Recommendations pertaining to the measurement of circulating testosterone in women indicate that testosterone may act directly via the androgen receptor/nongenomic androgenic action, or by reduction to the more potent androgen dihydrotestosterone and/or aromatization to estradiol and their metabolites. Testosterone concentrations decline during the reproductive years (Level IIB). Testosterone concentrations appear to be maintained in women beyond the age of 65 years, but whether this confers a benefit is yet to be understood (Level IIB).

	- Total testosterone can be measured with high accuracy and reproducibility using liquid/gas chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry assays (Grade B). Direct assays for the measurement of total and free testosterone are highly unreliable in the female range (Grade A). Reference laboratories should be "harmonized" with biological standards in coordination with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Expert Opinion). Measurement of testosterone using direct assays in clinical practice is appropriate if liquid/gas chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry assays are not available, to exclude high baseline concentrations and also to exclude supraphysiological concentrations during treatment (Expert Opinion). Research into testosterone physiology and clinical effects should mainly focus on measuring total testosterone as the main biomarker rather than "free" testosterone because there is more evidence supporting this approach.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for menopause, more specifically with respect to diagnostic criteria, the ES 2015 guidelines recommend making a presumptive diagnosis of menopause based on the presence of vasomotor symptoms, and, when indicated, conducting laboratory testing (FSH and serum estradiol) if establishing a diagnosis of menopause is necessary. This is particularly relevant for females who have undergone a hysterectomy without bilateral oophorectomy or present with an inadequate menstrual history to ascertain menopausal status.

Menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) is strongly recommended for women with early menopause, at least until the age of natural menopause, for relieving symptoms and preventing long-term medical conditions. Physiological replacement of estrogen (and progesterone if the uterus is intact) is essential for health and quality of life. The controversies surrounding the use of MHT concerning benefits and risks should not apply to the premature and early menopause population. Although there is evidence supporting the use of estrogens with adequate endometrial protection with progestogens (when the uterus is present) in women with premature and early menopause, there is a lack of evidence supporting the use of MHT for management of sexual dysfunction in this population.

The guiding principles are to avoid decreasing testosterone by using transdermal estradiol rather than oral estrogens because transdermal preparations exert minimal effects on SHBG and free testosterone levelsand modest improvement in sexual function of early postmenopausal women. Another approach to maintaining testosterone levels is the use of a bioidentical (biologically identical to the hormones produced in vivo) estradiol-containing contraceptive pill (estradiol valerate and dienogest, estradiol and nomegestrol acetate) in late reproductive age women requiring contraception, taking into account the androgenicity of some synthetic progestogens. The Fourth International Consultation of Sexual Medicine recommended conducting studies of testosterone therapy for women wit

### Society for endocrinology clinical practice guideline for the evaluation of androgen excess in women [^1144gQ9Y]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). High credibility.

Androgen excess is defined as clinical or biochemical evidence of increased production of androgenic steroids in women. It is observed in up to 10% of women of reproductive age and less commonly in postmenopausal women. Androgen excess typically manifests clinically as hirsutism or acne, but more severe and prolonged exposure can lead to overt virilisation, including clitoromegaly, deepening of the voice, female pattern hair-loss (FPHL), or erythrocytosis. Most adolescents and women of reproductive age who present to secondary or tertiary care with androgen excess will have underlying polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). However, other primary underlying pathologies must be excluded in a subset of patients harboring red flag clinical features. These include severe biochemical disturbances, rapidly progressive symptoms or signs, or presentation in the postmenopausal phase of life.

This cohort of patients has an increased likelihood of underlying neoplastic ovarian, adrenal or pituitary disease, or occasionally monogenic disorders of insulin signaling or androgen metabolism, compared to those with milder disturbances in the PCOS range. A detailed clinical history, targeted physical examination, and careful interrogation of the pattern and severity of biochemical disturbances are critical to rationalize the requirement and strategy for further biochemical, radiological, and, where appropriate, genetic investigations. Although androgen excess in women with PCOS is closely correlated with adverse metabolic health outcomes throughout their life course, serious biochemical disturbances present in a select cohort of patients require a thorough investigation to exclude alternative diagnoses.

### Prevacid SoluTab [^113kKZiw]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Human studies conducted over a period of up to one year have not detected any clinically significant effects on the endocrine system. The hormones studied include:

- **Male reproductive hormones**: testosterone, luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG)
- **Adrenal and pituitary hormones**: dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S), prolactin, cortisol, aldosterone, parathormone, glucagon
- **Female reproductive hormones**: estradiol
- **Metabolic and thyroid hormones**: insulin, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), triiodothyronine (T3), thyroxine (T4), somatotropic hormone (STH)

Lansoprazole, administered in oral doses ranging from 15 to 60 mg for up to one year, showed no clinically significant effect on sexual function. Furthermore, lansoprazole given orally in doses of 15 to 60 mg for durations of two to eight weeks indicated no clinically significant impact on thyroid function.

In 24-month carcinogenicity studies conducted on Sprague-Dawley rats with daily doses of lansoprazole up to 150 mg/kg, there was an increase in proliferative changes, including benign neoplasms in the Leydig cells of the testes, compared to control rats.

No systemic effects of lansoprazole on the central nervous, lymphoid, hematopoietic, renal, hepatic, cardiovascular, or respiratory systems have been observed in humans. Among 56 patients who underwent extensive baseline eye evaluations, no visual toxicity was found following lansoprazole treatment (up to 180 mg/day) for as long as 58 months. In studies involving lifetime lansoprazole exposure in rats, focal pancreatic atrophy, diffuse lymphoid hyperplasia in the thymus, and spontaneous retinal atrophy were observed.

### When to suspect androgen deficiency other than at menopause [^115eNQxR]. Fertility and Sterility (2002). Low credibility.

The objective of this review is to examine causes of female androgen insufficiency (FAI) aside from menopause.

- **Design**: A comprehensive review of the available literature in this field.

- **Results**: Androgen levels decline with increasing age during the reproductive years in healthy women and vary little or not at all across menopause, with controversy as to whether levels change in the postmenopausal years. Thus, the premenopausal decline in androgens potentially is the most common cause of FAI, whereas natural menopause in itself is not a cause of androgen deficiency. Pathophysiological causes of FAI can be divided into those that affect ovarian androgen production, those that affect adrenal androgen production, and combined deficiency states. Surgical menopause is characterized by an abrupt onset of symptoms, in contrast to a more insidious onset of relatively nonspecific symptoms in women who have FAI due to aging.

- **Conclusions**: The decline in testosterone with normal aging before menopause may well be the most common cause of FAI, although many women do not present with symptoms and most are not diagnosed until they have reached menopause.

Regarding specific circumstances of menopause, particularly for patients with early menopause, the ES 2015 guidelines recommend considering the continuation of hormone therapy in young patients with primary ovarian insufficiency or premature or early menopause. This is advised for those without contraindications, until the time of anticipated natural menopause. At this point, the advisability of continuing menstrual hormone therapy can be reassessed.

### Serum androgen profiles in women with premature ovarian insufficiency: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115h1RKz]. Menopause (2019). Low credibility.

If there is indeed a clinically significant reduction in androgen levels, androgen replacement therapy could be considered to augment the standard estrogen-based hormone therapy for women with POI/POF, but this needs to be further investigated.

Some studies have shown a positive correlation between serum androgen concentration in women with POI/POF and age. POI/POF is a pathological condition in which women have lower serum estradiol levels compared to other women of similar age. It is yet to be known if women with POI/POF present with lower androgen levels when compared with menopausal women. There is also uncertainty as to whether POI/POF is a cause of clinically significant androgen deficiency.

- **Comparison studies**: Many individual studies have compared androgen levels in women with POI/POF. However, results vary for each study due to the study methods employed and the use of different assays for measurement.

This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to incorporate data from all these studies collected using different methodologies by standardizing the unit of measurement. It utilizes a standardized mean difference (SMD) to calculate the overall effect and verify if there is indeed a significant reduction in androgen concentrations in women with POI/POF compared with a healthy control group.

### International society for the study of women's sexual health clinical practice guideline for the use of systemic testosterone for hypoactive sexual desire disorder in women [^111iTU1y]. Journal of Women's Health (2021). Low credibility.

- **Role of laboratory evaluation of androgen levels in managing HSDD**: Direct assays measure total testosterone in women using the radioimmunoassay (RIA) technique. Assays have not been standardized for this purpose at either a national or international level, and total testosterone concentrations may be reported as being substantially different for a single sample by different laboratories. Hence, direct assays for the measurement of total and free testosterone are highly unreliable in the female range.

Total testosterone can be measured with high accuracy and reproducibility using liquid chromatography (LC)/gas chromatography (GC) and LC-tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) assays. However, it is important to note that LC-GC and LC-MS/MS have also not been internationally standardized. If neither LC-GC nor LC-MS/MS is available, measurement of total testosterone using direct assays routinely used in clinical laboratories is appropriate.

- **What is the association between androgen levels and aging**: Androgen levels decline with age and drop abruptly after bilateral oophorectomy. The decline in androgen levels in postmenopausal women appears to be a function of age, aging ovarian function, and decrease in adrenal precursor steroids. Cross-sectional studies of healthy women demonstrate a substantial decrease in androgen levels across the reproductive years with no significant change across the menopausal transition (ages 45–54 years). In one study, women who had undergone bilateral oophorectomy (aged 55 years or older), not on exogenous steroids, had a significant decrease in androgen levels.

### Society for endocrinology clinical practice guideline for the evaluation of androgen excess in women [^112bNA7k]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). High credibility.

Validated, highly accurate tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) assays are recommended to measure serum total testosterone in women. However, across the UK, immunoassays remain the most accessible analytical technique. Most testosterone immunoassays display a bias relative to LC-MS/MS in female samples, which may be either positive or negative depending on the manufacturer and can also be concentration-dependent. Further data on the performance of several commercially available immunoassays in the United Kingdom, compared to the gold standard LC-MS/MS, are provided in the UK NEQAS. This bias has been attributed to poor standardization, poor sensitivity, and nonspecific cross-reactivity. Bias may also exhibit temporal variation, thereby reflecting reagent and calibrator reformulation.

Conversely, LC-MS/MS assays rely on purification and chromatography to minimize matrix effects, improve sensitivity, and reduce analytical interference. The mass spectrometer adds additional specificity as detection is based on mass-to-charge ratio rather than antibody-antigen reactions. Nevertheless, LC-MS/MS has limitations, and variation between methods has been attributed to differences in sample preparation and calibration. Thus, although measurement by LC-MS/MS remains the reference standard, this may not be viable for many UK hospital laboratories.

- **Recommendations**: Exclude the use of exogenous testosterone, for example, in postmenopausal women. All results should be interpreted against evidence-based reference ranges.

### Performance of total testosterone measurement to predict free testosterone for the biochemical evaluation of male hypogonadism [^116p18DP]. The Journal of Urology (2012). Low credibility.

Guidelines recommend serum total testosterone measurement as the initial test to evaluate male hypogonadism, reserving free testosterone assessment for men with suspected sex hormone-binding globulin abnormalities or total testosterone near the lower limit of normal. We determined the performance of total testosterone measurement as a test to identify men with normal vs. low free testosterone.

- **Materials and methods**: We examined the electronic medical records of all 3,672 men evaluated for hypogonadism by a serum testosterone panel, including total testosterone, sex hormone-binding globulin, albumin, and calculated free testosterone, from January 1, 1997, through December 31, 2007, in a network that serves veterans in Washington.

- **Results**: The sensitivity and specificity of low total testosterone (less than 280 ng/dl) to rule out and predict low calculated free testosterone were 91.0% and 73.7%, respectively. At thresholds of less than 350 ng/dl and less than 400 ng/dl, the sensitivity of total testosterone for low calculated free testosterone increased to 96.8% and 98.2%, and at thresholds of less than 150 ng/dl and less than 200 ng/dl, specificity increased to 98.9% and 92.6%, respectively.

- **Conclusions**: Total testosterone levels between 280 and 350 ng/dl are not sensitive enough to reliably exclude hypogonadism. Total testosterone must exceed 350 to 400 ng/dl to reliably predict normal free testosterone. Except when levels are less than 150 ng/dl, total testosterone measurement has low specificity for the biochemical diagnosis of hypogonadism.

### Counseling in menopausal women: How to address the benefits and risks of menopause hormone therapy. A FIGO position paper [^116yTPVn]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2024). High credibility.

Menopause marks the end of menstrual cyclicity and, depending on individual vulnerability, has several consequences related to gonadal steroid deprivation, especially if it is premature. Menopause may be more burdensome for some women than for others. Individual factors, such as personal history, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, and health conditions, affect symptomatology and, thereby, the menopausal experience. In addition, some menopausal symptoms, such as severe hot flashes, sleep disorders, and depression, are markers of future health risks.

Counseling is a fundamental part of health care in the peri- and postmenopausal periods. It must include an assessment of the patient's symptoms, needs, desires, and risk profile to address the benefits and risks of menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) on an individual basis and promote a healthy lifestyle. Indeed, healthcare practitioners can and must protect the health and lives of mid-life women by increasing awareness of menopausal symptoms and ensuring healthcare options, especially MHT. The type and duration of MHT should be tailored based on the patient's history, menopausal age, physical characteristics, and health status so that the benefits always outweigh the risks.

This FIGO position paper focuses on the benefits and risks of MHT on health domains, target organs and systems, and on systemic and vaginal MHT regimens. It provides indications that can be used in the clinical practice for menopausal counseling. Moreover, it offers insights into what FIGO considers the mainstay for the healthcare management of women.

### Managing menopause [^111RuZGR]. Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada (2014). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for menopause, particularly in patients with early menopause, the SOGC 2014 guidelines recommend initiating hormone therapy in patients with premature ovarian failure or early menopause, and continuing until the natural age of menopause.

### Global consensus position statement on the use of testosterone therapy for women [^111QMrMq]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Low credibility.

- **Clinical care of postmenopausal women**: Recommendations regarding full assessment of female sexual dysfunction (FSD) before commencing testosterone therapy highlight several factors, including hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD), female sexual arousal disorder (FSAD), and orgasmic disorder/dysfunction. These conditions have multiple etiologies, including biopsychosocial factors such as neuroendocrine imbalance, physical ill health or disease, interpersonal difficulties, psychological distress, and sexually repressive cultural or religious values (Grade C). Treatments should follow this biopsychosocial model and can include pharmacologic options like hormone therapies and other pharmacologic agents, psychotherapy, or multimodal treatments that combine both (Grade B).

- **Testosterone therapy and postmenopausal women**: The only evidence-based indication for the use of testosterone in women is the treatment of postmenopausal women diagnosed with HSDD following a formal biopsychosocial assessment (Level I, Grade A). There is a need for the development and approval of testosterone treatments specifically for women, formulated to approximate physiological testosterone concentrations for premenopausal women (Expert Opinion). In cases where an appropriate approved female testosterone preparation is not available, the off-label prescribing of an approved male formulation is considered reasonable, provided hormone concentrations are maintained within the physiological female range (Expert Opinion). Compounded "bioidentical" testosterone therapy cannot be recommended for the treatment of HSDD due to the lack of evidence for efficacy and safety, unless an authorized equivalent is available.

### The Kronos early estrogen prevention study (KEEPS): What have we learned [^114HBChS]. Menopause (2019). Low credibility.

Steroid hormone binding: Levels of sex hormone-binding globulin were higher in the o-CEE compared with the t-E2 and placebo groups. Given that hepatic sex hormone-binding globulin controls levels of free testosterone, it may not be surprising that these differing formulations of HT might influence sexual function differently. Free testosterone may be critically important to desire, arousal, orgasm, and sexual satisfaction. Overall, the proportion of women with low sexual function was significantly decreased after treatment with t-E2 but not o-CEE compared with placebo. Thus, KEEPS findings suggest that postmenopausal women with sexual concerns are better served by treatment with t-E2 than with o-CEE.

### Society for endocrinology clinical practice guideline for the evaluation of androgen excess in women [^114SFTYs]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). High credibility.

The primary objective of imaging in the work-up of patients with severe androgen excess is to identify structural culprit adrenal or ovarian pathology and to differentiate between incidental and clinically relevant lesions. The imaging approach can vary depending on the level of suspicion for PCOS versus non-PCOS pathology. When there is a high index of suspicion for PCOS, particularly in premenopausal women with irregular menstrual cycles and insidious onset of clinical features of hyperandrogenism, transvaginal ultrasound, if acceptable to the patient, is the most accurate as the first-line radiological investigation. This ultrasound should be undertaken by a professional with expertise in ovarian ultrasonography to screen for polycystic ovarian morphology to support the suspected diagnosis, rather than to identify a suspected neoplasm. However, from a diagnostic perspective, this may be unnecessary in patients with typical features of androgen excess and oligomenorrhea. If clinical indications suggest non-PCOS pathology, such as rapidly progressive severe clinical androgen excess or severe biochemical disturbances (e.g. serum T > 5 nmol/L), cross-sectional imaging of the ovaries and/or adrenals should be undertaken as appropriate. In patients with severe biochemical androgen excess, we recommend both ovarian and adrenal imaging irrespective of the biochemical pattern.

### Serum androgen profiles in women with premature ovarian insufficiency: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115KjYzX]. Menopause (2019). Low credibility.

The risk of bias assessment for studies selected for the comparison of androgen concentrations in POI/POF versus controls is reported in Table 5 [see Table, Supplemental Digital Content 1]. All the studies had clearly defined selection criteria for the cases, but for the controls, the selection is not described, although all the studies except one had defined the controls. All the studies except three fulfilled the comparability assessment. Most of the studies had fulfilled the exposure assessment.

Altogether, seven studies had a score of more than 6 ∗ s, namely that of Kalantaridou et al, van der Stege et al, Gulhan et al, Doldi et al, Hartmann et al, Janse et al, and Ates et al. For sensitivity analysis of testosterone concentrations, the studies by Ates et al, Gulhan et al, and Doldi et al. were not included because even though they scored 6 ∗ s on the scale, the selection methodology for cases and controls was not clearly mentioned. The studies by Kalantaridou et al, van der Stege et al, and Janse et al. scored 7 ∗ s or more on the scale and were of the highest methodological quality.

The study by Hartmann et al, while scoring only 6 ∗ s, had mentioned the selection methodology; it was just not clear if the participants were consecutively chosen, but because it mentioned how they were chosen as opposed to no description in the other three studies, it was included. Also, the study by Doldi et al. was included in the sensitivity analysis for androstenedione and DHEA-S because we wanted to compare a minimum of three studies to do the sensitivity analysis.

- **Measures of treatment effect**: For continuous data, we will calculate the mean difference (MD) between treatment groups where all studies report the outcome in the same way, such as HDL cholesterol. If the same outcome is reported on different scales, for instance, quality of life, we will calculate the standardized mean difference (SMD). We will reverse the direction of effect of individual studies if required, to ensure consistency across trials. We plan to treat ordinal data as continuous data and will present the 95% confidence interval (CI) for all outcomes.

For dichotomous (or categorical) data, we will use the number of events in the control and intervention groups of each study to calculate the Mantel-Haenszel (M-H) risk ratio (RR) with a 95% CI.

If a study presents two groups receiving two versions of the same intervention, such as two different doses, we will combine the effect measures to avoid loss of information and increase the precision of the effect measure.

In cases where studies do not report data in sufficient detail for the calculation of mean differences (MDs) or standardized mean differences (SMDs), we will contact the corresponding author of the study to request the required data, such as the mean score for each group, associated standard deviation of the mean for each group, and number of people in each group. If standard deviations (SDs) are not presented in the study reports and cannot be obtained from the study authors, we will estimate the SD of other related variables, for example, standard errors (SEs), CIs, or P (probability) values.

The effect size will be…

### Approach to the patient: The evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^114XKuPY]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

The evaluation of men aged 50 years and older with low serum testosterone concentration involves several critical steps.

- **Pretest probability determination**: The first step is to assess the pretest probability of hypogonadism. There is considerable overlap between the nonspecific symptoms of hypogonadism and depression. Despite the reported depressed mood and fatigue, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 screening tool was used and screened negative for major depression.

- **Assessment for specific symptoms**: A careful assessment for symptoms and signs that are more specific for hypogonadism is essential. In the initial cross-sectional report from the European Male Aging Study, three sexual symptoms — low libido, erectile dysfunction, and reduced morning erections — were consistently associated with low serum testosterone in a syndromic fashion, with diminished libido having the highest odds ratio for a low serum testosterone concentration. It is important to note that this epidemiology study cannot determine causality. Reduced sexual activity has been proposed to lower serum testosterone, suggesting observed associations might reflect reverse causation. In this study, the prevalence of these sexual symptoms was 25% to 35% even in men with normal serum testosterone.

Symptoms of fatigue and low mood are nonspecific and have low diagnostic value. These may be caused by systemic diseases. However, the presence of sexual dysfunction symptoms alongside low testosterone warrants further evaluation.

### Serum androgen profiles in women with premature ovarian insufficiency: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1161fKB3]. Menopause (2019). Low credibility.

- **Direct RIA subgroup**: The subgroup consisted of six studies (n = 398). This subgroup showed a standardized mean difference (SMD) of −0.60 [−0.90, −0.29], Z = 3.79 (P = 0.0002) with a decrease in heterogeneity: Tau² = 0.08; χ² = 10.94, df = 5 (P = 0.05); I² = 54%. The source of this heterogeneity could be explained by the fact that three of the six studies included in this particular subgroup happened to be studies with lower methodological quality. The study by Benetti-Pinto et al. had no description of how cases and controls were selected. The study by Elias et al. did not have age or BMI-matched cases and controls, nor did it have a description of how cases and controls were selected. The study by Falsetti et al. had no description of how cases and controls were selected, nor did it have a description if both cases and controls used similar tests to check for exposure. We tried removing these studies from this subgroup and observed that the heterogeneity substantially reduced to about 0%.

- **Other/nonspecified assay subgroup**: The subgroup consisted of only two studies (n = 513). This subgroup showed a SMD of −0.74 [−1.35, −0.14], Z = 2.39 (P = 0.02), with very high heterogeneity: Tau² = 0.17; χ² = 10.32, df = 1 (P = 0.001); I² = 90%. Both studies included in this subgroup were of lower methodological quality, and both were not age and BMI-matched in selecting cases and controls.

### Shbg, testosterone and type 2 diabetes risk in middle-aged African women: Exploring the impact of HIV and menopause [^114Ty9qX]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

Sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and testosterone are differentially associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D) risk. This study aims to investigate whether the associations between SHBG, testosterone, and T2D risk differ by HIV and menopausal status in Black African women living with (WH) and without HIV (WOH).

- **Design**: Cross-sectional observational study.

- **Setting**: Health Research Unit in Soweto, Johannesburg, South Africa.

- **Participants**: 81 premenopausal (57 WOH, 24 WH) and 280 postmenopausal (236 WOH, 44 WH) women from the Middle-Aged Soweto Cohort (MASC).

- **Main outcome measures**: Circulating SHBG and sex hormones, body composition (dual energy X-ray absorptiometry), insulin sensitivity (Matsuda index), secretion (insulinogenic index, IGI) and clearance, and beta-cell function (disposition index, DI). Dysglycemia was defined as either impaired fasting or postprandial glucose or T2D.

Results indicate that SHBG was higher and total and free testosterone were lower in postmenopausal WH compared to WOH (all p < 0.023). Irrespective of HIV serostatus, SHBG was positively associated with the Matsuda index, insulin clearance, and DI and inversely with HOMA-IR (all p < 0.011). The association between SHBG and the Matsuda index was stronger in premenopausal than postmenopausal women (p = 0.043 for interaction). Free testosterone, not total testosterone, was negatively associated with basal insulin clearance (p = 0.021) and positively associated with HOMA-IR in premenopausal, but not postmenopausal, women (p = 0.015 for interaction).

These findings show for the first time that midlife African WH have higher SHBG levels.

### Serum androgen profiles in women with premature ovarian insufficiency: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^113g3Lyg]. Menopause (2019). Low credibility.

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we analyzed the various androgen concentrations, including both the principal ovarian and adrenal androgens such as serum concentrations of total testosterone (T), androstenedione (A), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S), and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), and compared them with fertile and postmenopausal controls.

The pooled testosterone concentrations were found to be lower in women with premature ovarian insufficiency (POI)/premature ovarian failure (POF) compared with fertile controls: SMD (IV, random, 95% CI) −0.73 [−0.99, −0.46] with a p-value of 0.05.

The pooled DHEA-S concentrations were also lower in women with POI/POF compared to fertile controls: SMD (IV, random, 95% CI) −0.65 [−0.92, −0.37] with a p-value < 0.05. Notably, DHEA-S concentrations in POI/POF versus postmenopausal controls were statistically significant, with an SMD of 1.12 [0.10, 2.14] and a p-value < 0.05, indicating reduced DHEA-S levels in POI/POF but still higher than those in postmenopausal controls. Women in the postmenopausal group are generally older than those in the POI/POF group. A significant decrease in DHEA-S was observed in the postmenopausal group when comparing testosterone, DHEA-S, as well as androstenedione levels with POI/POF women, potentially attributable to aging. The study by Labrie et al. summarized that DHEA secretion decreases by an average of 60% by the time of menopause and continues thereafter.

### Approach to the patient: The evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^1138udww]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

Accurate assessment of serum free testosterone might be helpful when serum total testosterone concentration approximates the lower limit of normal or when abnormalities in sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) are suspected. A fasting early morning total testosterone concentration of > 350 ng/dL (12 nmol/L) measured by a reliable assay is generally consistent with a normal serum free testosterone and typically does not require assessment of free testosterone except in men with suspected or proven high SHBG concentrations. The most common causes of the constellation of a low serum total testosterone, low serum SHBG, and normal free serum testosterone (i.e. pseudohypogonadism) are obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D).

- **Causes of high and low circulating SHBG**: There are no well-validated, outcome-based normal reference ranges for serum free testosterone concentration in older men. In addition, there is wide variation in the quality and the various methods used to measure or calculate serum free testosterone concentrations. Direct methods of measurement of free testosterone are inaccurate and should not be used.

### Cardiovascular risk in women with premature ovarian insufficiency compared to premenopausal women at middle age [^116Hv2dJ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

A young age at menopause has been associated with increased cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. This study aimed to compare the cardiovascular risk profile between women with premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) and premenopausal controls of comparable age.

- **Design**: Cross-sectional case-control study conducted at two university medical centers.
- **Participants**: Women above 45 years of age diagnosed previously with POI (n = 83) and premenopausal population controls of comparable age (n = 266).
- **Main outcome measures**:
	- **Anthropometric and cardiovascular measures**: Blood pressure, body mass index, waist circumference, electrocardiogram, bilateral carotid intima media thickness.
	- **Hormonal levels**: Estradiol, testosterone (T), androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG).
	- **Metabolic parameters**: Insulin, glucose, lipids.
	- **Thyroid function**: Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free T4.
	- **Other biomarkers**: N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, C-reactive protein, uric acid, creatinine, homocysteine.

	The study assessed potential associations between POI status and subclinical atherosclerosis.

Women with POI exhibited an increased waist circumference (β = 5.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.6, 9.9), C-reactive protein (β = 0.75; 95% CI, 0.43, 1.08), and free T4 levels (β = 1.5; 95% CI, 0.6, 2.4). They had lower levels of N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (β = -0.35; 95% CI, -0.62, -0.08), estradiol (β = -1.98; 95% CI, -2.48, -1.48), testosterone (T) (β = -0.21; 95% CI, -0.37, -0.06), as well as androstenedione (β = -0.54; 95% CI, -0.71, -0.38) compared to controls, after adjusting for confounders. After adjustment, a trend towards increased hypertension (odds ratio = 2.1; 95% CI, 0.99, 4.56) and decreased kidney function was observed.

### Serum androgen profiles in women with premature ovarian insufficiency: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111955tz]. Menopause (2019). Low credibility.

This meta-analysis aims to investigate serum androgen profiles (testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, androstenedione, and sex hormone-binding globulin) in women with premature ovarian failure and to establish if there is evidence of diminished androgen levels in these women.

- **Methods**: Various internet sources, including PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and Medline, were searched systematically until February 2018. Out of a pool of 2,461 studies, 14, 8, 10, and 9 studies were chosen for testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, androstenedione, and sex hormone-binding globulin, respectively, after applying the inclusion/exclusion criteria for this meta-analysis. The effect measure was the standardized mean difference with a 95% confidence interval (95% CI) in a random-effects model.

- **Results**:
	- Testosterone concentrations in women with premature ovarian insufficiency were compared with fertile controls. The standard mean difference (IV, random, 95% CI) was -0.73 [-0.99, -0.46], with a P value < 0.05.
	- Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) concentrations were compared with fertile controls. The standard mean difference (IV, random, 95% CI) was -0.65 [-0.92, -0.37], with a P value < 0.05.
	- Androstenedione levels were compared with fertile controls, resulting in a standard mean difference (IV, random, 95% CI) of -1.09 [-1.71, -0.48], with a P value < 0.05.
	- Sex hormone-binding globulin levels did not show statistical significance.
	- Although dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate levels were reduced in cases of premature ovarian insufficiency, they were still higher than in postmenopausal women.

### Serum androgen profiles in women with premature ovarian insufficiency: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114pn3t6]. Menopause (2019). Low credibility.

- **Methods**: The eligibility criteria for this meta-analysis included all published studies describing serum androgen concentrations, including total testosterone (T), androstenedione (A), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S), and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) in women with premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) or primary ovarian failure (POF), compared with healthy controls. The predefined inclusion criteria were as follows: POI/POF defined as the cessation of menses (amenorrhea) for the past 3 months occurring before the age of 40; participants must have shown elevated follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels and reduced estradiol concentrations; controls were women without POI/POF.

- **Exclusion criteria**: Studies involving participants with hyperandrogenemia, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO), or gonadotoxic treatment post-menopause were excluded. Hormone therapy use by participants and studies focusing on chromosomally abnormal POI/POF were also exclusion factors. Reviews, case reports, letters to the editor, and conference papers were not included. Only studies published in English were considered eligible, and study methodology was not an exclusion criterion.

- **Study selection**: The selection process for the study was conducted in two phases. Initially, titles and abstracts were screened to meet the inclusion criteria by two separate researchers.

### Testosterone replacement therapy in naturally and surgically menopausal women [^1122Y454]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Testosterone replacement therapy in naturally and surgically menopausal women is a complex and highly debated topic. Opposing guidelines for testosterone use create a therapeutic dilemma for clinicians confronted by severely distressed women experiencing decreased sexual desire after surgical or natural menopause.

- **Aim**: In this review, we address the knowledge on androgen physiology, conditions associated with a low androgen state, and the risks and benefits of androgen therapy.

- **Methods**: An English-language Medline review was performed to gather relevant information.

- **Main outcome measure**: Review of available literature.

- **Results**: A summary of normal androgen physiology in women and a brief review of the use of androgens over the last six decades are included. The data on androgen replacement in pre- and postmenopausal women, especially its relationship to sexual functioning, is evaluated. Special concerns about the effect of androgens on cardiovascular disease, breast, and endometrial tissue are discussed. The balance of evidence seems to show that androgens have more of a positive effect than a negative effect in women if used properly.

- **Conclusions**: Testosterone replacement therapy for surgically and naturally menopausal women with low sexual desire can be accomplished physiologically and effectively after ruling out other medical conditions leading to low sexual desire. It is essential to inform patients that testosterone therapy is not an FDA-approved medication in the United States.

### Society for endocrinology guideline for understanding, diagnosing and treating female hypogonadism [^115wHh7i]. Clinical Endocrinology (2024). High credibility.

Female hypogonadism (FH) is a relatively common endocrine disorder in women of premenopausal age; however, there are significant uncertainties and wide variations in its management. Most guidelines are monospecialty and only address premature ovarian insufficiency (POI). Some allude to management in very brief and general terms, and most rely on the extrapolation of evidence from studies relating to physiological estrogen deficiency in postmenopausal women. The Society for Endocrinology commissioned new guidance to provide all care providers with a multidisciplinary perspective on managing patients with all forms of FH. This guidance has been compiled using expertise from endocrinology, primary care, gynecology, and reproductive health practices, with contributions from expert patients and a patient support group. The goal is to help clinicians best manage FH resulting from both POI and hypothalamo-pituitary disorders, whether organic or functional.

### Midlife steroid-binding globulin levels and in vivo neuroimaging measures of tau in older men and women [^1117pP4D]. Annals of Neurology (2025). High credibility.

- **Results**:

Sample demographics are presented in Table 1. SHBG was moderately positively correlated with total testosterone levels in men (r = 0.48, p < 0.001). All correlations, including those in women, are reported in the Supplementary Results and Supplementary Table S2.

There were no significant associations between neocortical Aβ‐PET burden and SHBG or total testosterone levels after adjusting for covariates (see Table 2).

- **Table 2: Main effects of free and total testosterone and SHBG in association with Aβ and tau‐PET signal in men (significance values are uncorrected)**:

	- In men, higher levels of SHBG were associated with lower levels of tau burden in 3 of the 6 regions, including entorhinal, inferior temporal, and rostral middle frontal regions, after adjusting for covariates (see Table 2 and Fig. 1). After adjusting for BMI, entorhinal and rostral middle frontal regions remained significant (results in Supplementary Table S6). There were no associations with total testosterone.

- **Figure 1: Associations between SHBG and FTP‐PET signal in entorhinal, rostral middle frontal, and inferior temporal regions (significance values are uncorrected)**:

	- FTP‐PET = 18 F‐Flortaucipir positron emission tomography; SHBG = sex hormone binding globulin.

In men, lower levels of inferior temporal tau‐PET burden were associated with higher levels of SHBG in the upper quintile of Aβ‐PET signal relative to lower quintiles of Aβ‐PET.

### Serum androgen profiles in women with premature ovarian insufficiency: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^113GAPom]. Menopause (2019). Low credibility.

There was significant heterogeneity between studies. Each of these androgens decreases with age. Most of the studies chosen had age-matched cases and controls, and only three studies did not match for age or BMI. Therefore, a sensitivity analysis was conducted using only the best quality studies for each androgen assessed. In these studies, cases and controls were age and BMI-matched, resulting in a substantial decrease in heterogeneity. Age and BMI were important factors in the quality assessment of the involved studies. Some studies did not adjust for these factors, which could be one of the reasons for the heterogeneity between these studies. Another reason could be the differences in selecting controls and methodologies used for recruitment. Finally, the most significant factor contributing to the heterogeneity could be the use of different assays for androgen concentration measurements. This was evident in the subgroup analysis using different assays, as seen in Supplemental Digital Content 3, 4, and 5. Most subgroups, which conducted analyses using the same assay, showed a substantial decrease in heterogeneity. However, a few subgroups using the same assay demonstrated reduced but still significant levels of heterogeneity. This could be explained by the wide variability in intra and interassay coefficients, even when using the same type of assay for measuring concentrations.

### The time is now for a new approach to primary ovarian insufficiency [^116fxKD6]. Fertility and Sterility (2011). Low credibility.

To articulate the need for a new approach to primary ovarian insufficiency, this condition, also known as premature menopause or premature ovarian failure, is defined by the presence of menopausal-level serum gonadotropins in association with irregular menses in adolescent girls or women younger than 40 years. It can be iatrogenic as related to cancer therapy or may arise spontaneously, either alone or as part of a host of ultrarare syndromes. In a large percentage of spontaneous cases, no pathogenic mechanism can be identified.

A literature review and consensus building at a multidisciplinary scientific workshop highlighted major gaps in knowledge regarding the etiologic mechanisms, psychosocial effects, natural history, and medical and psychosocial management of primary ovarian insufficiency. An international research consortium and disease registry formed under the guidance of an umbrella organization would provide a pathway to comprehensively increase basic and clinical knowledge about the condition. Such a consortium and patient registry would also provide clinical samples and clinical data with the goal of defining the specific pathogenic mechanisms. An international collaborative approach combining the structure of a patient registry with the principles of integrative care and community-based participatory research is needed to advance the field of primary ovarian insufficiency.

Back to the case

Measurement of serum total testosterone concentrations was repeated twice, three months later, after the patient had returned to baseline health. The measurements were performed on fasting blood samples drawn three weeks apart in the early morning (7–10 AM): 236 ng/dL (8.2 nmol/L) and 245 ng/dL (8.5 nmol/L). The reference range is 264–916 ng/dL and 9.16–31.8 nmol/L; the assay was validated and harmonized by the United States Centers for Disease Control. The SHBG was 22.7 nmol/L (reference range, 10–60 nmol/L). Calculated free testosterone, using the Vermeulen formula, was 56 pg/mL (194 pmol/L) with a reference range of 66–272.3 pg/mL and 229–710 pmol/L.

### Diagnosis and treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^113A9teq]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

A diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in perimenopause and menopause can be challenging. Although there are currently no diagnostic criteria for PCOS in perimenopausal and menopausal women, a presumptive diagnosis can be based on a well-documented long-term history of oligomenorrhea and hyperandrogenism during the reproductive years. The presence of polycystic ovary (PCO) morphology on ultrasound provides additional supportive evidence, though it is less likely in menopausal women.

- **Evidence**: The natural history of PCOS through perimenopause into menopause is poorly studied, but many aspects of the syndrome appear to improve during this transition. For women with and without PCOS, ovarian size, follicle count, and anti-Müllerian hormone levels (a marker of antral follicle count) decrease naturally with age. However, the decline in ovarian volume and follicle count may be less pronounced in women with PCOS compared to those without. Similarly, androgen levels decrease with age in both groups, with serum testosterone declining approximately 50% between the ages of 20 and 40. This is linked to reports of improved menstrual frequency in PCOS, although there is little evidence specifically supporting a decline in serum testosterone associated with the menopause transition.

- **Diagnosis in postmenopausal women**: Diagnosing PCOS in postmenopausal women is more problematic compared to adolescents, as there are no age-related testosterone cutoffs for diagnosis. Additionally, testosterone assays used to diagnose hyperandrogenemia in women are imprecise, even for those employing tandem mass spectrometry technology. Nonetheless, studies have indicated that peri- and postmenopausal mothers of women with PCOS, who have a history of irregular menstruation and symptoms related to hyperandrogenism, are at risk.

### Approach to investigation of hyperandrogenism in a postmenopausal woman [^113xW3KT]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

Menopausal transition is associated with a decrease in the number of antral follicles and ovarian volume, as well as a decline in serum antimüllerian hormone (AMH) as a marker for antral follicle count and ovarian reserve. When the number of antral follicles and ovarian granulosa cells decrease, estradiol levels decline and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels increase. Menopause, the last spontaneous menstruation, occurs on average at age 51 years when circulating estradiol has decreased to a level insufficient to stimulate the endometrium to grow and then shed. During this period, menopausal symptoms, including hot flushes, sweating, and sleep problems, are common and associated with the gradual decline in estradiol.

In contrast to the decrease in estradiol, circulating levels of testosterone decline as a consequence of age-related, but not menopause-related, reductions in secretion by both the adrenal gland and the ovary. This means a 50% reduction in testosterone in women aged 40–45 compared with women in the 18–24 age group. In premenopausal women, about 50% of circulating testosterone arises from direct secretion from the ovary and the adrenal gland, in equal amounts, under pituitary control of luteinizing hormone (LH) and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), respectively. The remaining 50% of testosterone is produced from peripheral conversion by ovarian and adrenal inactive androgen precursors, such as androstenedione (A4), dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), and DHEA sulfate (DHEAS). Testosterone is further converted in target tissues to dihydrotestosterone.

Regarding medical management for menopause, specifically concerning the management of cardiovascular risks, the ES 2015 guidelines recommend considering transdermal estradiol as first-line therapy for patients at moderate risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Transdermal preparations generally have a less negative impact on blood pressure (BP), triglycerides, and carbohydrate metabolism. It is advised to offer transdermal estradiol alone to patients without a uterus and to combine this agent with micronized progesterone or another progestogen, which does not adversely modify metabolic parameters, for patients with an intact uterus.

### Treatment of symptoms of the menopause: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^116ub51F]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for menopause, particularly the management of vasomotor symptoms, the ES 2015 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of estrogen therapy for menopausal patients under specific conditions. In patients who have undergone a hysterectomy and are younger than 60 years or within 10 years past menopause, estrogen therapy may be appropriate. For those without a hysterectomy, estrogen plus progestogen therapy is recommended. These treatments are suggested for those experiencing bothersome vasomotor symptoms, whether or not accompanied by other climacteric symptoms, provided they have no contraindications or excess risks of cardiovascular disease or breast cancer and are willing to undergo menopausal hormone therapy.

The search strategy involved databases such as PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Medline, covering studies from inception to February 2018. The primary evaluation of studies was conducted by reviewing titles and abstracts. Search terms included menopause, premature, ovarian, insufficiency, failure, POI, POF, testosterone, total testosterone, DHEA-S, androstenedione, and SHBG. In PubMed Central, the search syntax was: ("menopause, premature"[MeSH Terms] OR ("menopause"[All Fields] AND "premature"[All Fields]) OR "premature menopause"[All Fields] OR ("premature"[All Fields] AND "ovarian"[All Fields] AND "failure"[All Fields]) OR "premature ovarian failure"[All Fields]) AND ("androgens"[All Fields] OR "androgens"[MeSH Terms] OR "androgens"[All Fields] OR "androgen"[All Fields]). The search syntax was modified appropriately for other databases. Reference lists of related review articles were also examined for potentially eligible studies. Authors were contacted for additional information when necessary.

Study selection was conducted by two reviewers independently based on predefined inclusion-exclusion criteria. Final decisions on included articles were made following a thorough examination of full articles.

### The menopause transition: Signs, symptoms, and management options [^113db1pe]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Low credibility.

Menopause, the permanent cessation of menses, reflects oocyte depletion and the loss of gonadal steroids. It is preceded by a transition state, the perimenopause, which is characterized by the gradual loss of oocytes, altered responsiveness to gonadal steroid feedback, wide hormonal fluctuations, and irregular menstrual patterns. The goal of this mini-review is to discuss the basic pathophysiology of the menopausal transition and the hormonal and nonhormonal management of clinicopathology attributed to it.

- **Evidence acquisition**: A Medline search of epidemiologic, population-based studies, and studies of reproductive physiology was conducted. A total of 758 publications were screened.

- **Evidence synthesis**: The reproductive hormonal milieu of the menopausal transition precipitates bothersome vasomotor symptoms, mood disruption, temporary cognitive dysfunction, genitourinary symptoms, and other disease processes that reduce the quality of life of affected women. The endocrine tumult of the menopause transition also exposes racial and socioeconomic disparities in the onset, severity, and frequency of symptoms. Hormone therapy (HT) treatment can be effective for perimenopausal symptoms, but its use has been stymied by concerns about health risks observed in postmenopausal HT users who are older than 60 and/or women who have been postmenopausal for greater than 10 years.

- **Conclusions**: The menopause transition is a disruptive process that can last for over a decade and causes symptoms in a majority of women. It is important for clinicians to recognize early signs and symptoms.

### Low free testosterone is associated with hypogonadal signs and symptoms in men with normal total testosterone [^114XFAuG]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

During aging, total testosterone (TT) declines and SHBG increases, resulting in a greater decrease in calculated free T (cFT). Currently, guidelines suggest using TT to diagnose androgen deficiency and to reserve cFT only for men with borderline TT.

- **Objective**: Our objective was to investigate if either low cFT or low TT is more strongly associated with androgen-related clinical endpoints.

- **Methods**: A total of 3334 community-dwelling men, aged 40–79 years, were included in this study. Differences in clinical variables between the referent group of men with both normal TT (≥ 10.5 nmol/liter) and normal cFT (≥ 220 pmol/liter) with those who had normal TT/low cFT, low TT/normal cFT, and low TT/low cFT were assessed by regression models adjusted for age, center, body mass index, and comorbidities.

- **Results**: A total of 2641 men had normal TT (18.4 ± 5.5 [mean ± SD] nmol/liter)/normal cFT (326 ± 74 pmol/liter), 277 men had normal TT (14.2 ± 3.7)/low cFT (194 ± 23), 96 men had low TT (9.6 ± 0.7)/normal cFT (247 ± 20), and 320 men had low TT (7.8 ± 2.5)/low cFT (160 ± 55). Men with normal TT/low cFT were older and in poorer health. They had higher SHBG and LH and reported more sexual and physical symptoms, whereas hemoglobin and bone ultrasound parameters were lower compared to the referent group. Men with low TT/normal cFT were younger and more obese. They had lower SHBG, but LH was normal, whereas features of androgen deficiency were lacking.

- **Conclusions**: Low cFT, even in the presence of normal TT, is associated with androgen deficiency-related symptoms.

### Global consensus position statement on the use of testosterone therapy for women [^111gK2zf]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Low credibility.

Recommendations pertaining to the associations between endogenous androgen concentrations and female sexual function: The associations between endogenous androgen concentrations and sexual function in women remain uncertain due to issues relating to the sensitivity and specificity of androgen assays in some studies and insufficient data. The physiology of androgens is complex because of their conversion in tissues and possible intracrine metabolism in multiple tissues. No cutoff blood level can be used for any measured circulating androgen to differentiate women with and without sexual dysfunction (Grade C).

- **Recommendations regarding systemic testosterone therapy for postmenopausal women**: In doses that approximate physiological testosterone concentrations for premenopausal women, based on findings from meta-analyses of placebo/comparator-controlled RCTs. There are insufficient data to make any recommendations regarding the use of testosterone in premenopausal women for treatment of sexual function or any other outcome.

- **Recommendations regarding testosterone treatment of naturally or surgically postmenopausal women with HSDD, with/or without estrogen therapy**: Testosterone therapy, in doses that approximate physiological testosterone concentrations for premenopausal women, exerts a beneficial effect on sexual function. This includes increases, above the effects of placebo/comparator therapy, of an average of one satisfying sexual event per month, and increases in the subdomains of sexual desire, arousal, and orgasm.

### The influence of bariatric surgery on reproductive hormones and ovarian morphology and clinical findings in women: A prospective study [^114yb5pb]. Obesity Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) is a circulating protein that transports sex hormones in the blood, primarily testosterone and estradiol, the two most critical sex hormones. However, SHBG can also bind to other steroid hormones, such as dihydrotestosterone (DHT) as well as androstenedione, albeit with lower affinity.

Excess weight, particularly visceral fat (fat surrounding the abdominal organs), is a major contributor to insulin resistance. Following bariatric surgery, weight loss leads to a decrease in insulin resistance. Consequently, SHBG levels increase, binding more testosterone and thereby reducing the amount of free, biologically active testosterone. Bariatric surgery has been shown to decrease androstenedione and total testosterone levels in women.

In our study, we observed a statistically significant increase in SHBG levels at 6 months postoperatively, following weight loss. Consistent with previous findings, our study observed a significant reduction in total testosterone as well as androstenedione levels as weight loss progressed. These results further support the role of bariatric surgery in lowering androgen levels.

Similarly, in a study involving 100 women after gastric bypass, a significant drop in testosterone levels was observed alongside a notable increase in SHBG. Additionally, in the study by Lv et al, bariatric surgery led to decreased levels of total testosterone, DHEA, and estradiol, while SHBG levels increased, a change that was associated with a reduction in the incidence of abnormal menstruation.

### Endogenous sex hormones impact the progression of subclinical atherosclerosis in women during the menopausal transition [^114PjZhd]. Atherosclerosis (2012). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to determine whether endogenous sex hormones, including estradiol (E2), testosterone (T), sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), are longitudinally associated with the progression of atherosclerosis among women at midlife.

- **Methods**: 249 pre- or early peri-menopausal women, aged 42–57 years, from the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN) were followed for up to 9 years (median = 3.7 years). Participants had up to 5 repeated measures of common carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) and adventitial diameter (AD). Linear mixed models were employed for statistical analysis. The final models adjusted for multiple factors including age at baseline, time since baseline, cycle day of blood draw, race, income, systolic blood pressure (SBP), body mass index (BMI), insulin resistance index, lipids, C-reactive protein, and co-morbidity.

- **Results**: In the final models for IMT, each one log unit decrease in SHBG was associated with a 0.005 mm/year increase in IMT progression (P = 0.003). E2, T, and FSH were not associated with the level or progression of IMT. For AD, each one log unit decrease in E2 was associated with a 0.012 mm/year increase in AD progression (P = 0.04), and each one log unit increase in FSH was associated with a 0.016 mm/year increase in AD progression (P = 0.003). T and SHBG were not associated with the progression or level of AD.

- **Conclusions**: Independent of SBP, BMI, lipids, and other covariates, lower levels of E2 and SHBG, and higher levels of FSH were associated with increased subclinical atherosclerosis progression in women at midlife.

### International Society for the Study of Women's Sexual Health clinical practice guideline for the use of systemic testosterone for hypoactive sexual desire disorder in women [^111n8wfL]. Journal of Women's Health (2021). Low credibility.

By 2030, using the age of 50 years as a proxy for menopause, the world population of postmenopausal women will be around 1.2 billion, with an incidence of 47 million reaching menopause each year. Increasing numbers of women experience menopause earlier, with adverse health consequences affecting multiple systems, including those relevant to sexual health, often associated with significant distress.

The terms premature ovarian insufficiency (less than age 40 years) and early menopause (less than age 45 years) describe the spectrum of conditions associated with the loss of ovarian function before the age of natural menopause. Premature ovarian insufficiency and early menopause include both spontaneous primary ovarian insufficiency (idiopathic; caused by chromosomal and genetic defects; associated with autoimmune disorders, infections, metabolic disturbances, and environmental factors) and induced ovarian failure resulting from interventions (pelvic radiation therapy, chemotherapy, surgical oophorectomy, including risk-reducing bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy in women with BRCA mutations).

Circulating ovarian hormone levels of both estrogens as well as androgens are abruptly decreased and are more substantially reduced after surgical menopause than natural menopause. The prevalence of primary ovarian insufficiency in women younger than 40 years is approximately 1%; younger than 30 years, 0.1%; and younger than 20 years, 0.01%, with little difference by ethnicity. Spontaneous early menopause affects approximately another 5% of women between ages 40 and 45 years.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for menopause, specifically alternative medicine, the ES 2015 guidelines recommend counseling females seeking relief from vasomotor symptoms. They should be advised about the lack of consistent evidence for the benefit of botanicals, black cohosh, omega-3 fatty acids, red clover, vitamin E, and mind/body alternatives. These alternatives include anxiety control, acupuncture, paced breathing, and hypnosis.

### The utility of sex hormone-binding globulin in hypogonadism and infertile males [^115teLBD]. The Journal of Urology (2017). Low credibility.

We sought to determine the role of sex hormone-binding globulin in patients with male infertility. We retrospectively reviewed the records of 168 males seen at a fertility clinic from 2012 to 2014 to investigate the accuracy of total testosterone in the biochemical diagnosis of hypogonadism using calculated bioavailable testosterone as the reference value. We used multivariable analysis to assess sex hormone-binding globulin as an independent predictor of infertility.

Computations using calculated bioavailable testosterone as a standard in the measurement of definitive biochemical hypogonadism (less than 156 ng/dl) revealed 81% sensitivity, 83% specificity, 81% positive predictive value, and 82% negative predictive value for diagnosing hypogonadism with total testosterone alone. Of the 90 men with total testosterone greater than 300 ng/dl, 20% had low bioavailable testosterone less than 156 ng/dl, 52% had borderline low bioavailable testosterone less than 210 ng/dl, and only 48% could be considered biochemically eugonadal according to calculated bioavailable testosterone. Of the 80 patients with total testosterone less than 300 ng/dl, 19% had free testosterone levels greater than 6.5 ng/dl and, thus, could be considered to be eugonadal. By a magnitude similar to that of follicle-stimulating hormone, sex hormone-binding globulin independently predicted decreased sperm concentration (p = 0.0027) and motility (p = 0.0447). After excluding men with azoospermia, only sex hormone-binding globulin levels differed significantly in classicall.

### Society for endocrinology clinical practice guideline for the evaluation of androgen excess in women [^113Uqxx2]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). High credibility.

A GnRH analogue (e.g. triptorelin 3 mg or leuprorelin 3.75 mg) is administered intramuscularly or subcutaneously, with androgens measured at baseline and at 28 days after the injection. It is important not to measure androgens sooner than 28 days after the GnRH analogue administration, as there is usually an initial agonist phase when gonadotropins (and potentially androgens) may increase before subsequent suppression after 14–28 days. Although some advocate a 2‐ or 3‐month suppression test using longer‐acting depot formulations, this extends the timeframe of investigation and, in our experience, is not usually necessary. Suppression of gonadotropins and consequently androgens by at least 50% with a GnRH analogue confirms gonadotropin‐dependent ovarian hyperandrogenism. GnRH antagonists such as cetrorelix can also be considered for this purpose, avoiding the initial surge in serum T levels that are observed with GnRH analogues.

There are, however, a few caveats and limitations to acknowledge in this situation. First, some VOTs with completely autonomous androgen production can still retain minimal gonadotropin regulation of androgen secretion and testosterone will therefore not suppress; commonly, these ovarian tumors have gonadotropin suppression at baseline and have an increased risk of malignancy. Second, very rare cases of extra-ovarian LH‐dependent adrenal androgen production have been reported. For example, from an adrenal tumor, with shrinkage of an adrenal tumor with LH suppression also recently described. Third, this test does not reliably discriminate between ovarian conditions.

### Can we predict menopause and premature ovarian insufficiency [^114eLRQR]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). Low credibility.

The prediction of menopause and premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) involves understanding the factors that contribute to the timing of these events. Menopause is a natural biological process marked by the cessation of menstrual periods, typically occurring around the age of 51. In contrast, POI refers to the loss of ovarian function before the age of 40. Several factors have been used to predict menopause and POI, such as age, antimüllerian hormone, inhibins and follicle-stimulating hormone serum levels, antral follicle counts, menstrual cycle length, and, recently, some genetic markers.

It seems that age has the best predictive power, while the other factors contribute only in a very limited way to the prediction of menopause. Low levels of antimüllerian hormone in young women might indicate a greater risk for POI and could facilitate early diagnosis. It is important to note, however, that predicting the exact timing of menopause and POI is challenging, and individual variations are significant. Although these factors can provide some insights, they are not foolproof predictors. Advances in medical research and technology may lead to more accurate methods for predicting menopause and POI in the future.

### Is it time to revisit the recommendations for initiation of menopausal hormone therapy [^113Vxb4F]. The Lancet. Diabetes & Endocrinology (2025). Low credibility.

Findings from the Women's Health Initiative studies led to menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) guidelines generally recommending the initiation of MHT be limited to women within 10 years of their menopause or before the age of 60 years. This recommendation has led to women who experience troublesome menopausal symptoms and who have not commenced MHT within these limits often being denied this type of therapy. Similarly, the majority of women who might benefit from the protective effects of MHT against bone loss and fracture are not offered this treatment option if they do not fit with these criteria. Based on review of the evidence that led to the conditional initiation of MHT, and subsequent studies, we propose that the recommendations regarding the initiation of MHT need to change to be more inclusive of women outside these chronological limits.

### Determinants of serum total and free testosterone levels in women over the age of 65 years [^1136ffHD]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2007). Low credibility.

Little is known about testosterone (T) levels and their determinants in women of late postmenopausal age. We describe levels of total and free T and selected factors that influence these levels in a random sample of older women.

Levels of serum total T and free T by microdialysis were measured using ultrasensitive assays in 347 community-dwelling women aged 65–98 years enrolled in the Cardiovascular Health Study. Cross-sectional analyses were performed to define factors associated with total and free T levels.

In adjusted models:

- **Age-related decline**: Total T levels declined with age until 80, whereas free T levels did not vary by age.
- **Bilateral oophorectomy**: Women with bilateral oophorectomy had 23% lower total T and 16% lower free T levels than those with at least one intact ovary.
- **Oral estrogen use**: Oral estrogen users had total and free T levels that were 47% lower than never users.
- **Obesity and overweight**: Obese women had 47% higher total T and 20% higher free T levels, and overweight women had 24% higher total T and 14% higher free T levels, than normal weight women.
- **Racial differences**: Free T levels were 51% higher in black women.
- **Corticosteroid use**: Corticosteroid users had 75% lower total T and 43% lower free T levels than nonusers.

Bilateral oophorectomy, estrogen use, corticosteroid use, and low body mass index are independent risk factors for lower T levels in women aged 65 years and over. Although highly prevalent in women of this age, the physiological significance of low T levels in late postmenopausal women requires further investigation.
