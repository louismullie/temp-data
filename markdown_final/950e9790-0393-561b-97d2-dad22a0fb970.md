## Question

Courtney liked to collect marbles. She kept them in mason jars. One jar had 80 marbles. Her second jar had twice that amount. She just started her third jar which currently has 1/4 the amount of her first jar. How many marbles does she have in total?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how many marbles Courtney has in total across three jars, given the amounts in each jar. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the number of marbles in the first jar. Then, I should calculate the number in the second jar based on the first. Next, I will determine the number in the third jar. Finally, I will add all three quantities to get the total and double-check my arithmetic.

> Let me first confirm the base quantity. The first jar contains 80 marbles, so I will anchor on that number for subsequent calculations.

> Now, for the second jar, I need to ensure I apply the multiplier correctly. Twice the amount of the first jar is 2 times 80, which equals 160 marbles. Wait, let me verify that: 80 × 2 is indeed 160, so the second jar has 160 marbles.

> For the third jar, I should confirm the fraction. One-fourth of the first jar is 80 divided by 4, which equals 20 marbles. Hold on, I should verify: 80 ÷ 4 = 20, so the third jar has 20 marbles.

> Next, I should add the three amounts to get the total. 80 marbles in the first jar plus 160 marbles in the second jar plus 20 marbles in the third jar equals 260 marbles total. Let me double-check the addition: 80 + 160 = 240, and 240 + 20 = 260, so the total is 260 marbles.

---

Courtney has **80 marbles in the first jar**, **160 marbles in the second jar** (twice the first), and **20 marbles in the third jar** (one-quarter of the first). The total number of marbles is **80 + 160 + 20 = 260 marbles**.

---

## Step-by-step calculation

| **Jar** | **Description** | **Calculation** | **Number of marbles** |
|-|-|-|-|
| First jar | 80 marbles | Given | 80 |
| Second jar | Twice the first jar | 2 × 80 | 160 |
| Third jar | One-quarter of the first jar | 80 ÷ 4 | 20 |
| Total | Sum of all jars | 80 + 160 + 20 | 260 |

---

Therefore, Courtney has a total of **260 marbles**.

### Internal uncertainty impacts social information use in risky choice across adolescence [^8cd4b8c2]. Communications Psychology (2025). Medium credibility.

Third, advice skews this distribution and results in a riskier or safer decision policy than when participants decide alone. To model this, we re-parameterise the beta distribution toand, withandrepresenting the number of successes and failures in a binomial trial:

wherenow relates to the number of blue marbles andthe number of red marbles. This allows for a straightforward implementation of Bayesian updating in social trials by adding a value, toor:

orequal 1 when social information favoured the risky or safe choice, respectively, and 0 otherwise. This is an ideal Bayesian observer model where social information favouring the risky choice suggests that there are relatively more blue marbles (red marbles for safe advice) in the jar than the individual initially thought.

In Eq. 4, SI is a dummy variable that codes whether social information favoured the risky or safe option, which implements Baysian updating. But participants may not be ideal Bayesian observers, but also differ in their sensitivity to social information, irrespective of their internal uncertainty, meaning, for instance, they differ in whether they treat social information as equal to two or 20 marbles.

We model these differences in an orthogonal sensitivity to social information with the parameter(colours in Fig. 2). This version of the model suggests that people differ in ther social motivations or beliefs about others, leading to individual differences in suceptibility to social information beyond participants' internal uncertainty. Aof 0 means that participants ignored social information (Fig. 2, grey). By invoking separate parameters for(Eq. 5) depending on whether social information was safe or risky, this model updates the probabilities with differential sensitivity to safe vs risky social information that is often reported in the literature,:

Experimental manipulation of external uncertainty

We manipulated external uncertainty by asking participants to make decisions from description, where external uncertainty is low, or decisions from experience, where external uncertainty is high. When participants made decisions from description (Fig. 1a), the winning probability was shown to them unambiguously. Participants saw 100 red and blue marbles in the jar, with the number of blue marbles indicating the probability of winning.

Fig. 1
The marble task.

Participants choose between a risky or a safe jar after learning about possible outcomes and their probabilities either a from description, where external uncertainty is low or b from experience, where external uncertainty is high. Participants see social information about the choices of another participant (bottom) or not (top) in half of the trials each. We retrieved this social information from the decisions of participants in a previous experiment using the same probability-value combinations.

External uncertainty was higher in decisions from experience (Fig. 1b), where participants learned about outcome probabilities by observing nine samples from the jar (Fig. 1b; left). These nine samples of red and blue marbles were shown in five 3 × 3 grids with an interstimulus interval of 250 ms. There were also grey circles that served as placeholders; this was irrelevant to the current task but ensured fMRI compatibility in a planned follow-up study. We predetermined the sequences of red and blue marbles so that for each condition, every participant saw the same number of red and blue marbles. The samples were chosen to be as representative of the generative probability as possible. We then asked participants to estimate the proportion of blue and red marbles in the jar using a slider (Fig. 1b; middle) before making a decision from experience (Fig. 1b; right).

### Cognitive estimation in aged patients with major depressive disorder [^746a96d9]. Psychiatry Research (2010). Low credibility.

In everyday life, we often estimate rather than know. It was the goal of this study to assess the effect of depressed mood on cognitive estimation in old age. Cognitive estimation was performed in 44 subjects with major depressive disorder (MDD; DSM-IV) and 48 age-matched healthy subjects (HS). Severity of depressive symptoms was rated with the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS, mean = 18.6 ± S.D. 4.85). Estimation tasks comprised the dimensions length (coin diameter), weight (pile of paper), quantity (number of marbles in a glass jar), and time (estimation of time it takes for a marble to roll down a marble track both before and after having observed it). Other than the procedure followed in previous tests on cognitive estimation, the tasks were performed by observing objects rather than pictures thereof. MDD patients overestimated time (before and after observation) and underestimated quantity. Cognitive estimation was not correlated to measures of frontal functioning or semantic knowledge. We conclude that MDD patients in old age are impaired to some extent in cognitive estimation and in the ability to correct themselves, deficits that are likely to affect the performance of everyday activities.

### Internal uncertainty impacts social information use in risky choice across adolescence [^b66c0673]. Communications Psychology (2025). Medium credibility.

By virtue of Bayes' theorem, the difference between(Eq. 3) and(Eq. 5) is high when internal uncertainty is high and low when internal uncertainty is low. This means that if participants only saw one red and one blue marble, social information favouring one jar would greatly impact their beliefs, much more than when they saw ten red and ten blue marbles, even when the mean of the prior belief was the same before seeing social information (see Fig. 2b). With these updated probabilities, the expected utility of choosing the risky jar is computed as:

Per convention, a risky choice is predicted by the difference between the expected utilities of the risky and safe jars with a sigmoid choice function that has a temperature parameter. A higher temperature parameter implies more randomness in our participants' choices, akin to the increased randomness of molecule movements when the temperature of a system increases:

We compared the models' predictive accuracy using approximate leave-one-trial-out cross-validation and the resulting leave one out information criterion (looic — a fully Bayesian version of classical model fit indices such as AIC and BIC).

Models were implemented in the probabilistic programming language stanand fitted with stans' Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm. Every model was fitted using four Markov chains of 6000 iterations; the first 2000 iterations of every chain were discarded as warmup. We implemented the model hierarchically; with age groups that we preregistered in our recruitment strategy as hyperpriors (see Fig. S3 for a graphical model and priors). To understand the relationship between age and the parameters of the most accurate cognitive model (see next section), we estimate a multivariate Bayesian linear regression and predict parameters of the cognitive model with linear and quadratic polynomials of our participants' age. We preregistered the computational model as an exploratory analysis and did not specify particular hypotheses for this analysis.

Methods

Participants

We report the data from 76 female and 90 male (n = 166, sex self-reported) German participants from the Berlin Dahlem area (aged 10–26, m = 15.82) who were invited to our laboratory (see Fig. S1 for age distribution, puberty status and sex). Participants received a payment of 10€ for their participation and could get a bonus based on their decisions in the experiment. The experiment was programmed using jsPsychand administered in a regular web browser on a computer in the lab. On the same occasion, participants also completed other social decision-making tasks reported elsewhere, the digit-span test for working memory capacityand the CFT-20Rtest for general cognitive ability. Participants provided their informed consent to these procedures, and the local ethics committee approved the study (protocol number A-2018-22).

Task and procedure

Participants were asked to make a series of risky decisions under high and low external uncertainty, with and without additional social information about how someone else chose between the same alternatives. The task consisted of 144 trials, in each of which participants saw two marble jars. The jars differed in the proportion of red and blue marbles in them. We instructed participants to choose which jar to draw a random marble from in each trial. Participants would win points if they drew a blue marble from the jar.

There was a safe and a risky jar in each trial. The jars differed in the probability of drawing a blue marble and in how many points a blue marble would promise. The safe jar contained only blue marbles, and choosing the safe jar would always result in 5 points. The risky jar contained both blue and red marbles. A risky jar promised more points (8, 20, or 50 points), which, however, were awarded only with some probability (probabilities were 0.125, 0.25, 0.375, 0.5, 0.625, or 0.75). The probabilities corresponded to the proportion of blue marbles in the jar. Every combination of points and probabilities was shown eight times in randomised order. In choosing the risky jar, participants risked gaining nothing for the prospect of gaining more points. The points they accumulated were translated into a real monetary bonus at the end of the experiment. The bonus payment in € was determined by multiplying the points collected by 0.008.

Overall core lexicon differences across groups

Figure 2 shows the empirical cumulative distribution function (cdf) of the total number of unique core lexicon words (max = 26) produced by each group. The horizontal axis shows the number of core lexicon words produced, x, and the vertical axis shows the cumulative proportion of participants who expressed x-number of words or less. This graph allows us to visually compare the proportions of the distributions of total number of core lexicon words produced for each group. Visual inspection of the figure, for example, indicates that whereas about 50% of the controls produced around x = 20 words or fewer, 50% of the MCI and ProbableAD subjects produced about x = 18 words or fewer. Interestingly, the 75th percentile for both the MCI and Probable AD groups was about x = 20 words, the median for the distribution of the Controls. In sum, the distribution of the total number of core lexicon words produced for the Controls is shifted to the right of the respective distributions for the MCI and Probable AD groups. Formally, a one-way ANOVA test with 3 levels (Control, MCI, and ProbableAD) indicated a statistically significant difference in the number of unique core lexicon words said across the three groups (F = 7.62; p < 0.001). Tukey pairwise tests confirmed a significant difference between the Control and ProbableAD groups (p < 0.001) and no statistically significant differences between the Control and MCI groups (p = 0.159) or the MCI and ProbableAD groups (p = 0.438).

### Kea show three signatures of domain-general statistical inference [^858206c5]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Experiment 1

This experiment investigated whether kea are able to make statistical inferences about two populations of objects using relative frequencies. Over three conditions, we tested whether (1) kea would prefer a sample from a population containing a majority of rewarding tokens, as opposed to a population where they were in the minority, and whether kea rely on relative frequencies, (2) the absolute number of rewarding tokens or (3) the absolute number of unrewarding tokens, when choosing between samples from two populations. Illustrations for the three conditions are provided in Fig. 1.

The first condition aimed to test whether kea would prefer a sampled token from a population where there was a higher probability of randomly sampling a rewarding token, as opposed to a population where there was a higher probability of sampling an unrewarding token. Two jars were presented: one contained a 1:5 ratio of rewarding-to-unrewarding (rewarding-to-unrewarding tokens), and the other contained a 5:1 rewarding-to-unrewarding ratio. Both jars contained 120 tokens in total.

The second condition tested whether kea were making their choices based on absolute frequencies or relative frequencies. In order to make this distinction, subjects were presented with two jars containing the same number of rewarding (black) tokens, in differing proportions. One jar had a 1:5 rewarding-to-unrewarding population of 120 tokens, whilst the other had a 5:1 rewarding-to-unrewarding population of 24 tokens. If kea were using the absolute number of rewarding tokens to guide their choices, we predicted they would choose at chance. If, in contrast, they were taking into account the relative proportion of rewarding-to-unrewarding tokens, we predicted they would choose the jar with only four unrewarding tokens.

In the third condition, we presented subjects with two jars containing the same number of unrewarding tokens: one jar had a 57:63 rewarding-to-unrewarding population (120 tokens total), whilst the other had a 3:63 rewarding-to-unrewarding population (66 tokens total). If kea were simply selecting the jar containing the fewest unrewarding tokens rather than comparing between the frequencies of token populations between jars, they should perform at chance in this condition.

### Children's exploratory play tracks the discriminability of hypotheses [^2e2b074b]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

To normalize for individual differences in children's exploratory behavior, we computed the time each child spent exploring on each trial as a proportion of the child's total playtime across all four trials and multiplied this proportion by the number of trials in the experiment. Thus, a proportion less than 1 represents less playtime (and a proportion more than 1, more playtime) than would be expected if children distributed their playtime evenly across trials. Although we use proportional playtime to control for individual differences in length of play, all results hold using untransformed (log) playtime reported in seconds (see SI).

To quantify the discriminability of different contrasts, we adopted a variant of the standard signal detection model in which shaking a box with m marbles in it would produce a perceptual trace drawn from some probability distribution over a high-dimensional acoustic space, which can be projected down to a one-dimensional space of abstract numerosity analogous to representations in the approximate number system. We modeled the internal representation for each auditorily perceived number as a normal distribution on a log scale (see SI), with equal variances σ but logarithmically spaced means, and computed the discriminability of each contrast between l and m marbles presented in Experiments 4–7 in terms of the standard indexwhereand. See SI for a summary of these d ′ values (Supplementary Table 1), as well as a discussion of alternative ways of estimating discriminability (including different mathematical models, and an empirical estimate from independent adult psychophysical data). These produce nearly identical results for our purposes. We modeled children's intuitions about task difficulty as proportional to this d' measure. Note however those children hear only a single set of marbles in the box on each trial and have no way of judging directly from the auditory data the discriminability of the two set sizes being contrasted. Rather, we posit that children's sense of discriminability depends on their ability to evaluate the contrast between the sounds they hear and their simulation of the sounds they would have heard had the alternative set of marbles been in the box.

Experiment 2

Experiment 2 tested whether kea could integrate information about a physical constraint into their prediction of a sampling event, as infants do. After giving kea experience of a barrier (training protocols provided in Supplementary Methods), we presented them with two tasks where two jars, each with a barrier placed half-way down the jar, were sampled from. Each jar contained identical overall populations of tokens (80 tokens total: 40 rewarding and 40 unrewarding) but the proportions differed above and below the barriers. In Condition 1, one jar contained 20 rewarding and 20 unrewarding tokens above the barrier, and the same below it. The other contained 20 rewarding and 4 unrewarding tokens above the barrier and the remaining 56 tokens below the barrier (20 rewarding, 36 unrewarding). Condition 2 was identical but with the frequencies reversed. In one jar, one population contained 20 rewarding tokens and 20 unrewarding tokens above and below the barrier. The other contained 4 rewarding, and 20 unrewarding tokens above the barrier, and the remaining tokens below it (36 rewarding, 20 unrewarding). If kea could integrate knowledge of the barrier into their relative frequency judgements, we predicted they would choose the jar with 20 rewarding tokens and 4 unrewarding tokens above the barrier in Condition 1 and the jar with equal numbers of rewarding and non-rewarding tokens above the barrier in Condition 2.

As in Experiment 1, kea were given further training until they reached a criterion of 17/20 trials, which took them, on average, 26.67 trials (s = 16.33 trials) for Condition 1 and 48 trials (s = 30.33 trials) for Condition 2. Summaries of individual training data are provided in Supplementary Table 3. Five of the six subjects tested performed above chance in the first 20 trials of both conditions of Experiment 2 (Bayesian binomial test, relative preference 0.5, BF > 3, Table 1).

These results not only confirm the results of Experiment 1, in showing kea use the relative frequency of objects to make statistical inference, but also show that kea can flexibly integrate physical knowledge into these inferences. When a barrier was placed in the jar, kea used only the relative frequency above the barrier when deciding which hand was more likely to contain a rewarding token.

Fig. 4
Children's proportional exploration times across Experiments 4–7 as a function of the actual number of marbles in the box.

There is no significant correlation between exploration time and number of marbles. Error bars indicate SEMs. Source data are provided as a Source data file.

We also analyzed other factors that might affect exploration. Across experiments, children's exploration decreased only slightly over the four successive trials (β = −0.051, 95% CI [−0.086, −0.016]); age had no effect on children's tendency to explore the hardest contrast longer than the easiest one (β = −0.041, 95% CI [−0.45, 0.40]). As expected, children's accuracy increased with the discriminability of the contrast (β = 1.12, 95% CI [0.64, 1.46]); there was a marginal effect of age on children's accuracy (β = 0.033, 95% CI [−0.0074, 0.069]).

Finally, we asked whether aggregate behavior in each individual experiment and each individual child's behavior also tended to conform with the predictions of the discriminability model. There was substantial variability in individual children's playtimes, but average playtimes within each experiment were qualitatively well-predicted by a linear fit to the discriminability model (Fig. 5). In addition, in each experiment, a significant majority of individual children explored more, on average, for more difficult discriminations (Fig. 5): for 19/24 children in Experiment 4 (79%; 95% CI [0.58–0.93]), 21/24 children in Experiment 5 (85%; 95% CI [0.68–0.97]), 18/24 children in Experiment 6 (75%; 95% CI [0.53−0.90]), and 19/24 children in Experiment 7 (79%; 95% CI [0.58–0.9]), a linear regression of that child's playtimes onto discriminability had a positive slope. Hence, not only on average, but at the level of individuals as well, children systematically explored longer when contrasts were less discriminable.

### Kea show three signatures of domain-general statistical inference [^f9df45e7]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Condition 2 tested if kea were using an absolute quantity-based heuristic by selecting the jar with the most rewarding tokens. Here, kea had to choose between 2 hands that both sampled from a population containing 20 rewarding tokens. However, one population had 100 unrewarding tokens, and the other had 4 unrewarding tokens. Four kea chose the jar with fewer unrewarding tokens within their first 20 trials (Bayesian binomial test, relative preference 0.5, BF > 3). Again, we gave subjects experience with this task until they reached a 17/20 criterion, which took 66.67 trials (s = 41.31 trials) on average.

Condition 3 controlled for a second absolute quantity-based heuristic, the avoidance of the jar with the most unrewarding tokens, a control which capuchins fail. Kea observed sampling from one jar which contained 63 unrewarding tokens and 57 rewarding tokens and a second that again contained 63 unrewarding tokens but only 3 rewarding tokens. All 6 kea chose the jar with 57 rewarding tokens above chance within their first 20 trials (Bayesian binomial test, relative preference 0.5, BF > 3), and took 46.67 trials (s = 27.33 trials) on average to reach the 17/20 criterion.

The results of Experiment 1 (Table 1) provide conclusive evidence that kea show true statistical inference using the relative frequency of items, rather than using quantity heuristics based on the absolute number of items. Four of our six subjects performed above chance within their first 20 trials of both Conditions 2 and 3, indicating they had not learnt during their past experience to use a heuristic based on choosing the population with either the most rewarding, or most unrewarding items. Kea therefore did not behave as capuchins do, in using the absolute number of positive or negative tokens within the jars to make decisions. Instead, kea mirrored the performance of infantsand chimpanzeesin using the relative frequency of objects across this experiment.

### Jumping to the wrong conclusions? An investigation of the mechanisms of reasoning errors in delusions [^456e3463]. Psychiatry Research (2014). Low credibility.

Using the standard coding of errors (choosing the jar designated 'incorrect',), half of the guesses made in response to equivocal evidence are coded as correct decisions, as are correct guesses made before any beads are drawn. Conversely, evidence-based decisions made when the evidence supports the 'incorrect' jar are counted as errors. However, in the current study reasoning errors were the focus of attention: we wished to avoid arbitrary labelling of a response as an error, and therefore defined reasoning errors as responses that were not supported by the accumulation of presented evidence (i.e. illogical responses). Thus, on the easy task, choosing the mostly black jar at any point was considered to be a reasoning error, coinciding with the standard coding of errors according to experimentally determined jar. On the hard tasks, choosing the mostly red jar or the positive survey at the first, fifth, or seventh and subsequent draws, the mostly blue jar or the negative survey at the third draw, or either after two, four or six draws was coded as a reasoning error. Decisions made before seeing any bead or word, (i.e. at draw 0) were rated as a reasoning error. Thus, our error coding differed from the standard method for a total of 42 decisions (two on 85:15; 19 on 60:40 beads; 21 on 60:40 emotional, see Table 1). In practice, error frequencies were similar using the two methods (85:15 standard, n = 36 errors; this study, n = 38 errors; 60:40 standard, n = 74 errors; this study, n = 80 errors; emotional, n = 58 errors, this study, n = 53 errors). Repeated measures ANOVA showed no effect of method of error coding (x2: new or standard) on error rates by task (x 3: 85:15, 60:40; emotional) or overall (F values all < 1.7, p values all > 0.2).

### The case of the cookie jar: differences in typical language use in dementia [^fd6feb18]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2024). Medium credibility.

For the majority of the core lexicon content words the same trend occurred, with the ProbableAD group differentiating itself early and the MCI and Control groups displaying varying differences of a lesser degree. A dramatic example is the word flow (or flowed, flowing, flows, overflowed, overflowing, overflows) in Fig. 8, where only 30% of the ProbableAD group said the word by about 100 s into the task, while 50% of the Control and MCI groups said it within about the first half minute. Similarly, dry (Fig. 6), was produced by only about 30% of the ProbableAD group over the entire time, but was produced by 50% of the Control group by about 40 s and 45% of the MCI group by about 50 s. The word stool (Fig. 7) is an example of a specific word that was more difficult for the ProbableAD group to produce, sometimes substituting the word chair instead, which would not have counted. Less than 50 s into the task, 80% of the Control and MCI groups and barely 50% of the ProbableAD group said stool.

### Increased intra-individual variability among individuals with ADHD: first evidence from numerosity judgment and verbal and quantitative reasoning [^564d1772]. Psychological Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Results

Initially, we recruited 255 participants. The pre-registration involved exclusion rules to ensure the quality of the data. Regarding Phases 1 and 2, the rules required participants to provide estimates in the range of 90–750 and to do so for at least seven (out of nine) jars. For Phase 3, exclusion rules required participants to answer at least 80% of the ADHD questionnaire. In addition, in one item, participants were told 'For this specific item, please do not select any option'. Participants who chose one option were excluded. Following those rules, 37 participants (14.51% of the initial sample) were excluded. Therefore, the final sample consisted of 218 participants.

From Phases 1–3, we derived three variables. The first variable was the IIV, which served as our sole dependent variable. To calculate IIV for each participant and jar, we computed the absolute distance between the estimates made in Phase 1 v. 2. These absolute distances were then standardized by jar, to account for the variance in the answers to the different jars. Next, we calculated the IIV for each participant by computing the mean of the standardized absolute distances across the jars. Finally, IIVs were standardized across participants, to obtain a dependent variable with an intuitive meaning.

The second variable was the Absolute Error (AE), which represented the overall accuracy of a participant's judgment, across jars and phases. To calculate the AE for each participant and jar in Phases 1 and 2 separately, we computed the absolute difference between their estimate and the correct number of candies. These AEs were then standardized by jar, for Phases 1 and 2 separately. Next, we computed the mean AEs for each participant in Phases 1 and 2 separately, by averaging the standardized AEs across jars. As a result, each participant had a mean AE score for Phase 1 and for Phase 2. Then we averaged the two mean AEs for each participant. Finally, the AEs were standardized across participants. Note that higher AEs indicate lower-performing participants.

The third variable was the assessment of ADHD symptoms. This measure represented the extent to which a participant experienced ADHD symptoms in their day-to-day life. An ADHD score was calculated for each participant by averaging the scores of all 18 items. ADHD scores were then standardized across participants. Higher values indicated participants with stronger ADHD symptoms.

### Diverse wMel variants of wolbachia pipientis differentially rescue fertility and cytological defects of the bag of marbles partial loss of function mutation in drosophila melanogaster [^8ea19e1c]. G3 (2021). Medium credibility.

Fertility assays

We used the following w 1118 isogenic bam genotypes for the fertility assays: w 1118; bam + / bam +, w 1118; bam L255F / bam null-In2-3xP3-DsRed, and w 1118; bam L255F / bam L255F. In addition, we performed a small control fertility assay using combinations of the alleles described above and the classic bam BW hypomorph and bam Δ59 alleles.

We performed the fertility assays for w 1118; bam + / bam + and w 1118; bam L255F / bam null-In2-3xP3-DsRed in three batches to reduce technical error from too large of an experiment. We included separate uninfected controls in each batch of W. pipientis variants and used these to make statistical comparisons of mean progeny per female.

We performed all fertility assays (except for the small bam BW and bam Δ59 analysis) as follows (and described by):

We collected virgin females and aged them 2–3 days, only using flies that eclosed within 48 h of each other to reduce developmental variation. We collected virgin males uninfected with W. pipientis and aged them for 2–3 days. We distributed males from different bottles across the female genotypes to control for any bottle effects. We individually crossed virgin females to two virgin males. The trio was allowed to mate for 8 days, and then flipped to new vials. After the second 8 days, the trio was cleared. The progeny for each trio was counted every other day to get the total adult progeny per female. Progeny per female is reported in increments by day that reflect the days after the first progeny eclosed. For example, we report total progeny for days 1–9 which are the progeny counted on day 1 of eclosion to day 9 of eclosion.

For the control fertility assay containing the bam BW hypomorph and bam Δ59 alleles, we collected and aged flies as described above, except the progeny per trio was counted only once at the end of the experiment.

Egg laying assay

We collected virgin females for each genotype and W. pipientis variant and CantonS virgin males and aged them as described above for the fertility assays. We allowed each trio to mate for 24 h on grape juice agar supplemented with yeast before flipping them to a new grape juice agar vial. We counted the eggs laid within 24 h and repeated this for 3 days.

To analyze where the individuals in each group were looking, we analyzed the elapsed time until the first word for each quadrant was said for each group. Figure 9 shows the survival curves for all four quadrants of the picture. With the exception of the Top Left (log-rank χ² = 4.42, p = 0.05), the curves for all quadrants were significantly different (p < 0.001; χ² = 11.16 for Top Right, 17.51 for Bottom Left, and 23.69 for Bottom Right). In all three cases, the pairwise comparison showed significant differences between the ProbableAD group and the other two groups, but no significant differences between the Control and MCI groups. In all quadrants, the Control and MCI groups' curves stayed near each other throughout and were not significantly different (see Table 3). In the Top Left, all three curves stayed very near each other, until about 80% of the people in each group said a word in the quadrant and were not significantly different. This may be due to a combination of factors including the action taking place in the quadrant, the comparative simplicity of that segment of the picture, the written word labels on the cookie jar, and the fact that the top left is a reasonable place for English speakers to look first. The other curves show an increasing gap between the ProbableAD group and the other groups. In the Top Right and Bottom Left, the curves split after 40% of individuals in the group said a word in that quadrant. In the Bottom Right, the ProbableAD group diverges from the MCI and Control groups from the very beginning, indicating that individuals from the ProbableAD group said none of the words from that quadrant at a rate similar to that of individuals from the other two groups.

### The core metabolome and root exudation dynamics of three phylogenetically distinct plant species [^1e2f5dd6]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Root exudation dynamics in three species.

Principal component plots of root exudates collected after 0.5 h, 2 h, 4 h, 1 d, 4 d of B. distachyon a, A. thaliana b, and M. truncatula c. Details of this dataset are given in Supplementary Figs. 2 and 3. Total number of metabolites: 63. Number of jars with 3–5 plants: 3–4 for each timepoint. One representative experiment out of three total is displayed.

To choose the optimal exudate collection duration, the metabolite abundance data was converted to presence-absence (higher than background in 50% of more of samples), allowing the comparison of metabolite numbers present at certain timepoints. With the latest timepoint (4 d) set to 100%, we detect 16% of compounds at 0.5 h, 32% at 2 h, 61% at 4 h, and 84% at 1 d. We conclude that for experiments that are not time sensitive such as comparisons of ecotypes or mutants, longer collection times maximize compound number and intensity. However, long collection times may obscure differences present at earlier timepoints, and factors such as metabolite re-uptake are likely more relevant at higher metabolite concentrations, complicating the picture. For experiments with high temporal resolution, we recommend a collection window of a few hours. For all further experiments presented here, a 2 h exudate collection window was chosen.

Elevated zero maze

The elevated zero maze tests murine anxiety-like behaviors. Mice were placed individually on a circular runway (50 cm diameter, 5 cm wide track, 50 cm above ground) which is divided into four 90° quadrants. Two opposing quadrants are surrounded by 30 cm high walls while the in-between quadrants have no walls. The mice were placed facing the entrance of one of the walled quadrants. Time spent in each quadrant was video recorded and scored for the number of zone transitions, distance moved, and percentage of time in open and closed zones. Each mouse is tested for ten minutes.

Y maze test

The y maze spontaneous alternation test quantifies murine spatial cognition. Mice were placed in the center of a y-shaped maze with three opaque arms at 120° angles from each other. The mouse was free to explore all three arms of the maze. Mice were monitored for either 10 min or 22 arm-changes, or whichever happened first. We calculate the percentage of "correct" and "incorrect" movements, where correct patterns are three subsequent arm changes (e.g. arm A to arm B to arm C) and incorrect patterns are three arm changes in repeated arms (e.g. arm A to arm B to arm A). Entry to the arm is marked once all four limbs have entered that arm.

Marble burying test

Marble burying measures compulsivity in mice. Our apparatus is an 11 cm × 11 cm box filled with a layer of bedding and a 3 × 3 square of evenly placed blue marbles on top of the bedding under recording on the Ethovision video monitoring system. Mice were placed in the apparatus for 10 min. We quantified the total distance traveled and velocity of the mice from the Ethovision tracking system, and marble burying was quantified manually. We quantified the number of marbles buried, number of marbles re-buried, and time spent burying (seconds and percentage of total time).

Text narrative experiments: procedure

Participants read 200 stories at their own pace, one sentence at a time. After reading about a given event in the story (e.g. "Alice waited in line patiently") participants pressed the spacebar on their keyboard to get the next sentence. On some deterministic transitions (explained below), after pressing the spacebar, participants were given a two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) prediction probe. This probe was of the following form: "Alice waited in line patiently; What do you think will happen next?", they could then indicate with their left or right arrow key one of two responses "While ordering tea, Alice noticed the barista's new mustache", or "Before ordering cake, Alice took a quarter from the tip jar". After using the right or left arrow key to respond, the next event would show up on the screen: "Before ordering cake, Alice took a quarter from the tip jar". There was a 2500ms enforced minimum time for each sentence to discourage people from rushing through the experiment. At the end of each story, a screen with the following words appeared: "NEW STORY". Each experiment lasted about 45 minutes.

### The determinants of genetic diversity in butterflies [^7e062591]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Chromosome number correlates with genetic diversity

While π₄D correlates positively and significantly with chromosome number (posterior mean slope = 0.279, p = 0.004, Table 1, Fig. 2b), it is not significantly correlated with genome size, i.e. the physical length of the genome (estimated using flow cytometry, see Methods section) (Supplementary Table 1). Assuming that the number of genes in the genome (and other potential targets of selection) is more or less constant and independent of genome size, population genetic theory predicts the aggregate effect of selection on linked neutral diversity to be largely determined by the map length of a chromosome, for a given set of selection and mutation parameters, (see Discussion section).

Although (unsurprisingly) the effect of chromosome number we find depends disproportionately on the two species with the fewest chromosomes (Pieris brassicae, n_c = 15, and Melanargia ines (the Spanish marbled white), n_c = 13, Fig. 2b), removing both species still gives a positive (albeit non-significant) relation between genetic diversity and chromsome number (posterior mean slope = 0.181, p = 0.117).

### Increased intra-individual variability among individuals with ADHD: first evidence from numerosity judgment and verbal and quantitative reasoning [^86dffed6]. Psychological Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Study 1: numerosity judgments

In this study, participants were asked to make quantitative estimates of the number of candies in a series of jars, at two separate points in time. IIV was defined as the absolute difference between the estimates made on these two occasions. ADHD symptoms were also assessed. We hypothesized that ADHD symptoms would be positively correlated with IIV. Based on the existing literature, we also anticipated that stronger ADHD symptoms would be associated with less accurate estimates. To rule out the possibility that the relationship between IIV and ADHD could be attributed to a difference in level of performance, Study 1 controlled for participants' accuracy.

Method

Participants

We recruited 218 individuals via the MTurk platform. Participants were not recruited according to any particular characteristic. A power calculation confirmed that this sample size was sufficient for detecting a small-to-medium effect size of r = 0.19 with a 95% confidence level and a power of 0.80. The participants took part in an 11-minute study and received $2 in compensation for their contribution. The mean age of the sample was 36.86, the standard deviation was 10.70, and 42.66% of our participants were females.

Materials and procedure

To familiarize the participants with the research materials (as is common practice in judgmental tasks, e.g. Yaniv and Choshen-Hillel,), they were first presented with two photographs, each showing a jar containing candies, with the correct number of candies in the jar displayed alongside it.

The experimental procedure involved three main phases. Phase 1 consisted of exposing the participants to nine photographs, each featuring a jar containing candies that had not been presented before. All the participants were shown the same nine photographs, but the sequence in which the jars were shown was randomized. In each trial, participants were asked to estimate the number of candies in the jar and were given a time limit of 30 s to make their estimates. The actual number of candies in the jars ranged from 120 to 607. Participants were informed that the person who achieved the most accurate estimates would receive an additional payment of $1. Participants were asked to keep their estimates within the range of 90–750.

Marble-burying test (MBT)

MBT (see Supplementary Video) was performed in transparent cages containing ~4.5 cm fine sawdust, as described by Odland et al. Twenty glass marbles were placed equidistant from each other in a 5 × 4 pattern. The experiment was done under dim light in a quiet room to reduce the influence of anxiety on behavior. The mice were left in the cage with the marbles for a 30-min period, after which the test was terminated by removing the mice. A marble was considered buried when two-thirds or more of its size was covered with burying substrate, and the number of buried marbles was counted after 30 min. All mice underwent a pretest without any injection, and the number of marbles buried was counted. Only mice that buried at least 15 marbles were selected to perform the test after drug administration. Eighty percent of pretested mice fulfilled this criterion and were used in the definitive experiment, which took place at least a week following the pretest.

Open field test (OFT)

The OFT was performed immediately after the MBT to evaluate the effects of the drug treatments on locomotor activity. The apparatus consisted of a square wooden arena (50 × 50 × 40 cm) with white walls and a black floor. Mice were placed individually in the center of the open field and allowed to freely explore the apparatus for 30 min. A camera was used to monitor movement. The total distance traveled (centimeters) was measured by the Ethovision XT-12 Video Tracking System (Noldus Information Technology BV). After each test, the arena was cleaned with a 70% alcohol solution.

Sweet wine, unblended, served Odysseus well in the escape with his companions from the Cyclops' cave during his epic return to Ithaca. The wine, a gift from Maron, grandson of Dionysus, was exceptional. "When he drank it he mixed twenty parts of water to one of wine, and yet the fragrance from the mixing bowl was so exquisite that it was impossible to refrain from drinking". Odysseus carried a large skin with this wine, in case on the way he had to deal with some unknown savage of great strength who "would respect neither right nor law".

Mixing wine with water before drinking was a mark of civilized behavior in ancient Athens and an essential feature of the symposium, a gathering in which drinking together was intertwined with conducting business. The practice spawned a line of equipment for transporting, mixing, and consuming wine. One such implement was the krater, a vessel in which wine was diluted to the right consistency for drinking. Kraters, often too large to be used for serving, were positioned in the center of a room and sometimes were decorated with images of symposium proceedings.

Athenian pottery was common in the Mediterranean region as far back as 2,800 years ago. Clay vessels of different sizes, shapes, and uses were widely traded. And while little painting of that period has survived, even on stone, intact and fragmented painted vases from various locations abound because they were exceptionally durable, more so than metal. As a result, they became a repository, not only of painting but of religious and social norms and daily activities, from raising children to burying the dead. Historical and mythologic scenes, also used heavily, provided the opportunity to inject life scenes with life lessons.

### Wilm's tumor 1 promotes memory flexibility [^3138788c]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Spontaneous alternation and reversal learning in a Y maze

Spontaneous alternation and reversal learning were performed as described previously. Briefly the Y-maze consisted of three white opaque arms (Med Associates) with sliding doors at the entrance of each arm. During spontaneous alternation test animals were allowed to freely explore the three arms from the center of the maze for 10 min and spontaneous alternation was defined as successive entries into each of the arms on overlapping triplets sets (e.g. ABC, BCA, CAB, etc). The percentage of alternation was calculated by as the ratio of total alternations to possible alternation (total arm entries −2) × 100. For the reversal learning experiment mice were single housed, food restricted and monitored daily until they reached 85% of their original weight before starting the experiment and during testing. They were given 1/2 food pellet (LabDiet 5053) and one fruit loop (Kellog's) each day. The habituation phase was identical to spontaneous alternation. During the acquisition phase, one arm of the maze was chosen as the "correct arm" and baited with half of a fruit loop. The animals were initially restrained in the "start arm" for 1 min and then allowed to explore between the two arms. The acquisition phase consisted of 10 consecutive trials per day for 2 days (each day divided in 2 blocks of 5 trials each). Memory was calculated as the percentage of correct choice over each block of trials. During the reversal learning phase the "correct arm" was switched. The "correct arm" was counterbalanced between animals. Both experiments were scored by an observer blind to the experimental conditions and analyzed manually.

Marble burying test

Regular rat cages were used and filled with ~5 cm deep bedding tamped down to make a flat, even surface. A regular pattern of 20 glass marbles was positioned on the surface of the bedding, spaced regularly, about 4 cm apart one from the other. Each animal was left in the cage for 30 min and the % marbles buried was calculated as the number of marbles buried to ~2/3 of their depth over the total number of marbles × 100.

### S100B dysregulation during brain development affects synaptic SHANK protein networks via alteration of zinc homeostasis [^2fa3b909]. Translational Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

To assess whether S100B treatment during pregnancy causes any alteration in social interaction and aggressive behaviors, mice were tested in a resident-intruder task. The latency to the first attack (Fig. 6a) and the total number of attacks or sniffing events (not shown) against the intruder were not statistically different between the two groups. However, an increased proportion of mice without aggressive behavior during the entire observational time was noticed in the S100B group (Fig. 6e).

Fig. 6
Adult mice that received S100B injection during late embryogenesis show social impairments and increased stereotypic behaviors.

In the resident-intruder task, although (a) the latency to the first attack is not different between the two groups (p = 0.202), the percentage of mice that does not display an aggressive behavior during the interaction with the intruder is statistically higher in S100B group (e, Fisher's test, p < 0.001). A significant increase in stereotypic behaviors such as (b) rearing (p = 0.021) and (c) self-grooming (p = 0.008) events were detected in S100B mice during both intruder (not shown) and marble burying tests. In addition, (d) the percentage of mice with jumping behavior is statistically higher in the S100B group (f, Fisher's test, p < 0.001). Statistical analysis according to Mann–Whitney U test (when not indicated) or Fisher's test.

Enhanced repetitive behavior is another core feature of ASD. Therefore, we analyzed stereotyped behaviors in two different stressful contexts, namely the exposure to a novel environment (first 10 min of marble-burying test habituation phase) and during social interaction (resident-intruder test, also during the habituation phase). Our results showed a significantly increased number of rearing, self-grooming, and jumping behaviors (though not of digging, not shown) in S100B mice during the habituation phase of both marble-burying and resident-intruder tasks (Fig. 6b, c, d), indicative of an increase in stereotypic behaviors. However, no significant differences were detected between the two groups in the latency to bury the first marble (Supplementary Fig. S4b) and the total number of buried marbles (Supplementary Fig. S4c), suggesting no changes in compulsive-like behavior.

### Diverse wMel variants of wolbachia pipientis differentially rescue fertility and cytological defects of the bag of marbles partial loss of function mutation in drosophila melanogaster [^f26672f1]. G3 (2021). Medium credibility.

All w Mel variants rescue the ovarian bam hypomorph cytological defect but to varying degrees

Although we wanted to assess the rescue of the bam hypomorphic fertility phenotype by W. pipientis because we can also compare this to the effect of W. pipientis on wildtype bam fertility, we also wanted to know if genetic variation in W. pipientis affected the rescue of the bam hypomorphic cytological phenotype. Because fertility is affected by environmental and genetic differences that act in later developmental stages outside of bam' s function early in gametogenesis, we also measured the effect of W. pipientis variation on the rescue of the cytological bam mutant phenotype. Since the partial loss of function of bam results in over-proliferation of GSCs and reduced differentiation, we can quantify bam function by assaying for differentiated germ cells. The cytological bam hypomorphic phenotype in females consists of tumorous ovarioles filled with GSC-like cells, with few properly developing egg chambers (Figure 6A). Properly developing egg chambers contain polyploid nurse cells, which feature large, easily identifiable nuclei (Figure 6A, arrowheads). We counted the number of nurse cell positive egg chambers as a measure of GSC daughter differentiation and thus bam function. We found that all of the W. pipientis variants tested significantly increased the number of nurse cell positive egg chambers, and that W. pipientis variants in the w MelCS-like clade showed highest numbers of nurse cell positive egg chambers (Figure 7B). We then pooled together the data individually for w Mel-like, w Mel2-like, and w MelCS-like and asked if there was a difference in mean number of cysts containing nurse cells per ovary between each clade (Figure 6, C and D). We found that w MelCS-like variants had a significantly higher effect size than w Mel-like and w Mel2-like (Figure 6, C and D), and that wMel2-like had a higher effect than w Mel-like (Figure 6E). These results are consistent with the fertility assay results for the bam L255F / bam null hypomorph genotype, however we observed a more obvious trend of higher bam rescue by the w MelCS-like variants in this assay. All of the W. pipientis variants with the highest effect size of increased bam function are in the w MelCS-like clade. It is unclear whether this higher rescue is due to titer or another genetic difference between these clades, but these data indicate that genetic variation in W. pipientis impacts the bam rescue phenotype.

### Diverse wMel variants of wolbachia pipientis differentially rescue fertility and cytological defects of the bag of marbles partial loss of function mutation in drosophila melanogaster [^f709d4bf]. G3 (2021). Medium credibility.

All w Mel variants rescue bam hypomorph female fertility but show a range of effect sizes

Our results from the w 1118; bam + / bam + fertility assay indicated that none of the W. pipientis variants tested have an overall increase in fertility in females (Figure 4). We performed the same fertility assay as described above for the w 1118; bam + / bam + genotype for the bam L255F / bam null genotype infected with the same 10 W. pipientis variants. Females of the bam L255F / bam null genotype exhibit tumorous ovaries and are only weakly fertile (Figures 2B and 3). In contrast to the wildtype bam lines, in the bam L255F / bam null lines, we found that all variants increased female fertility both in the first week of progeny eclosion and throughout the entire measured timeframe with the exception of w MelPop2X, as infected females died before the end of the experiment, thus we only report the first week of progeny production for this variant (Figure 5, A and B). Notably, and some variants had a large effect on female fertility. The variants with the largest effect sizes were in the w MelCS-like clade (w MelCS2b, w MelPop2x, and w MelPop8x) (Figure 5, A and B). This fertility rescue is in contrast to the decrease in fertility by the same W. pipientis variants in the wildtype bam background, especially for w MelCS2b which had the largest negative effect on wildtype bam fertility, but the largest positive effect on bam L255F / bam null fertility (Figure 5, A and B). In all of the lines tested there were many individual females that had no progeny as well as females with varying distributions of progeny. In some of the lines (w Mel2a, w MelCS2a, and w MelCS2b) there were outlier females who had large rescue of fertility, some in the range of what we observe for wildtype bam fertility (Figure 4, B and C). However, for most of the individuals tested, fertility was not fully rescued, e.g. restored to wildtype levels (Figures 4, B and C; 5, A and B). Although the largest effect of W. pipientis on bam L255F / bam null rescue was amongst the w MelCS-like variants, there were other notable variants outside of the w MelCS clade that showed high increase in female fertility, particularly w Mel2a. Overall these data further indicate a genetic interaction between bam and W. pipientis that is specific from the overall effect of W. pipientis on female fertility.

Mouse probabilistic learning task (PLT)

Throughout each session of the PLT, mice were presented with three pairs of unique stimuli (fan/marble, honey/cave, spider/fan) in three separate 20-trial blocks. For the first block, one stimulus was rewarded 90% of the time and the other was rewarded 10% of the time. The next blocks included 80/20 and then 70/30 reinforcement rates. The mice were given two hours to complete the task. Mice were tested for 1–10 consecutive sessions.

Mouse five-choice continuous performance task (5C-CPT)

Mice were trained in the 5C-CPT as previously described (see Supplemental Materials and Supplemental Figure S1). Target trials were indicated by illumination of a single stimulus window; nontarget trials consisted of illumination of all five windows. Hits and correct rejections were rewarded. False alarms resulted in a 10 s timeout period. Mice were first trained on a 2:1 ratio (2 target trials to 1 nontarget) for five sessions. They were then tethered to the recording apparatus for two sessions of 2:1 to acclimate to the head stage, and then moved to a 5:1 ratio. Similar to the human 5C-CPT, two different difficulty conditions were included, with easy (3 s response window) and hard (1.5 s response window) trials across ten recording sessions.

The study CLARITY was published by Meg J Jardine and colleagues in 2022 in the journal BMJ. This study is related to the following diseases: COVID-19 infection. In the CLARITY study, the trial question was: what is the role of ARBs in patients with COVID-19 infection? In the CLARITY study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the CLARITY study, the population was: 787 patients (282 female, 505 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients admitted to the hospital for the management of COVID-19. The key exclusion criteria were previous treatment with a renin-angiotensin system blockade; hyperkalemia or unrecorded serum potassium; low eGFR; or unrecorded kidney function. In the CLARITY study, the interventions were: n = 393 ARB (predominantly oral telmisartan at a starting dose of 40 mg/day for 28 days) n = 394 placebo (matching placebo for 28 days). In the CLARITY study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in WHO Scale score at day 14 (1 point vs. 1 point; OR 1.51, 95% CI -0.13 to 3.15). In the CLARITY study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in death at day 28 (2.5% vs. 1.5%; OR 1.74, 95% CI 0.62 to 5.25) No significant difference in respiratory failure (6.6% vs. 5.1%; HR 1.32, 95% CI 0.74 to 2.43). In the CLARITY study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in hyperkalemia, hypotension, AKI. In the CLARITY study, the conclusion was: in adult patients admitted to the hospital for the management of COVID-19, ARB was not superior to placebo with respect to WHO Scale score at day 14.

### Targeted tshz3 deletion in corticostriatal circuit components segregates core autistic behaviors [^e7063d2f]. Translational Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Repeated patterns of behavior

We selected four measures that were highly loaded on the "repetitive patterns of behavior" factor in a factor analysis: marble-burying and time burrowing in a new cage, number of stereotyped dips in a hole-board device, and number of leanings in an open field. The protocols used have been previously detailed. The marble-burying and time burrowing tests quantify perseverating behavior. Marble burying consists in scoring the amount of marbles buried by each mouse in a 30 min session, using a 40 × 18 cm cage with 45 cm-thick litter and containing 20 marbles (9 mm diameter) on the surface of 70 mm thick dust-free sawdust. Completely buried, 2/3 buried and 1/2 buried marbles were scored 3, 2, and 1, respectively. The time burrowing test leans on spontaneous digging and pushing behavior that rodents display when placed into a new home cage. The length of time each mouse spent digging plus pushing was measured. The number of stereotyped dips was counted in a hole-board device, consisting of a 40 × 40 cm board with 16 equidistant holes (3.5 cm diameter) each equipped with photo-beams for detecting head dipping. Exploratory head dipping occurs when a rodent is placed on a surface with holes: the mouse puts its head once into one hole of the board. Head dipping is considered stereotyped when the head dips at least twice in the same hole within 2 s. The open-field behavior was measured in a circular open field (100 cm diameter and 45 cm high walls) brightly lighted (210 lux on the ground). The ground was virtually divided into three concentric zones of the equal surface. The distances walked and the times spent in the open field in the zones were automatically measured via the Viewpoint-Behavior technologies system. The observation lasted 20 min. The number of leanings (rearing while leaning) on the walls of the structure was previously validated as a measure of repetitive behavior. The number of zones crossed is a measure of the narrowness of the field of interest. The total distance walked during the observation period served as covariate for the comparison between cKO mice and their respective controls.

### The March of the beetles: epistatic components dominate divergence in dispersal tendency in tribolium castaneum [^793f8ac7]. The Journal of Heredity (2020). Medium credibility.

Artificial Selection

Selection lines were initiated by collecting 1200 male and 1200 female pupae from the source population. These were subdivided into 3 replicates for the high selection lines and 3 replicates for the low selection lines (for each sex). Each of the 12 groups of 200 sexed pupae were kept isolated in 250 mL fly jars with standard media for up to 1 week to ensure that all of the pupae had become adults.

To perform selection, we placed 200 virgin beetles of the same sex in the conditioned media (Figure 1, jar 1) and allowed the beetles 24 hours to move between jars. The dispersal chamber was left undisturbed in the incubator during the 24-hour dispersal period. Parents for the low selection line were drawn from those beetles that remained in the conditioned media, while the high selection line was drawn from beetles that moved into either the second or third jars before the end of the 24-hour test. This was replicated to create 3 sets of high and low selection lines.

After the 24-hour test period, the selected males and females (approximately 80 to 100 each) from a replicate were combined and allowed to randomly mate. Parents were removed from the mating jar after 14 days and pupae for the next generation of selection were collected beginning on or about 25 days after the initiation of mating. This process was repeated for a total of 5 generations.

### Efficacy of three feeding regimens for home-based management of children with uncomplicated severe acute malnutrition: a randomised trial in India [^ae2a1e46]. BMJ Global Health (2016). Medium credibility.

During the treatment phase, household visits were carried out by a study worker with similar educational qualifications to the government's Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA) who are women from the communities trained as health educators and promoters by the government, and a key cadre in India's community health worker programme designed to improve maternal and child health. The visits were conducted weekly to counsel, resolve caregivers' queries and difficulties, to replenish supplies, and to collect empty RUTF-L jars and wrappers of RUTF-C packets. The workers used site-specific counselling cards made in the local language. The cards included messages on how frequently, how much and how to feed, on continuing breast feeding, good hygiene and advice on family meals. A copy of the card was also given to the family. In the A-HPF group, local, culturally appropriate, energy-rich and nutrient-rich recipes were also printed on the cards. Information on recommended recipes is provided in the online supplementary file. Information on intake of RUTF-L and RUTF-C was recorded; the amounts of ingredients used weekly were documented for the A-HPF group. For calculation of food consumption, the used packets (RUTF-C) or jars (RUTF-L) were collected from each home during the weekly visit throughout the treatment phase. The total calories consumed were calculated by multiplying the number of calories in a packet (500 kcal for RUTF-C) and jar (1328 kcal for RUTF-L) by the number of packets or jars consumed by the child. The calorie consumption in kcal/kg/day was calculated by dividing the total calories consumed by the number of days the child was available during the treatment phase and weight at enrolment. We did not collect consumption data for the comparison group given the greater difficulty in capturing valid information. The neighbourhood peer support workers recruited post-DSMB recommendations visited homes several times a day to help caregivers feed their children in all the three groups. They were given a daily financial incentive for this activity.

### Hippocampal subfield vulnerability to α-synuclein pathology precedes neurodegeneration and cognitive dysfunction [^56b365a7]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2023). Medium credibility.

Behavioral analyses

Behavioral studies occurred in a mouse behavioral testing suite using ANY-maze software (Stoelting) in conjunction with a ceiling-mounted video camera to track and record behavior during testing. Fibril-injected and control mice were randomly intermixed during testing in a blinded manner. Prior to any testing, mice were habituated to handling and allowed to acclimate to the testing suite. All behavioral studies that did not require testing on consecutive days were interspaced to provide animals with a minimum 24 h period of rest. Assays which required repeated testing, or in which mice were placed in the same apparatus sequentially, were subjected to rigorous inter-trial cleaning with 70% ethanol. Standard parameters for all assays were maintained and followed across longitudinal testing periods.

Open-field test

Open-field was performed as previously described. Briefly, mice were placed in the open-field apparatus for a 20 min assessment period. Several metrics regarding mouse behavior were quantified via ANY-Maze software and included average speed, total distance traveled, and time spent in the center versus the periphery of the apparatus.

Marble-burying test

Marble-burying was conducted following an established protocol. Mice were individually placed in a standard housing bin filled with 4× the typical amount of bedding material, along with 20 marbles (1 cm diameter, clear) arranged in a 4 × 5 array on the surface of the bedding material. Following a 30 min period, mice were gently removed from the housing bin and each bin was photographed for subsequent analysis. Images were scored for the number of visible marbles across the surface of the bedding material. A calculation was then performed to determine the number of buried marbles.

Elevated plus maze

Anxiety-related behavior was assessed with the elevated plus maze. Mice were placed in the enclosed corner of the elevated plus maze apparatus at the start of the assay facing the open arms. Mice were allowed to freely explore the apparatus over a 10 min period. Time spent in either the enclosed or open arms was determined via ANY-maze software. The absolute number of arm entries was also measured. An entry was defined in ANY-maze as a transfer of 60% of detected body area into one of the defined arms of the apparatus. Between testing sessions, the apparatus was thoroughly cleaned with 70% ethanol.

### Temporal manipulation of the scn1a gene reveals its essential role in adult brain function [^73d1ffbd]. Brain (2024). Medium credibility.

Recordings were analysed using Clampfit 11.2 (Molecular Devices). Passive membrane properties were derived from the voltage response to the hyperpolarizing current steps of the current step protocol (average of five steps), as previously described.

The voltage threshold for firing was determined through the phase-plane plot [plot of the time derivative of voltage (dV/dt) versus voltage] of the first AP elicited by the current step protocol. The threshold was defined as the first voltage value at which dV/dt exceeded 10 mV/ms. Rheobase was determined as the amplitude of the first current step at which an AP was fired, and the current threshold density was calculated by dividing the rheobase by the cell capacitance. The AP and AHP amplitude were obtained from the AP and AHP peak, respectively, relative to the voltage threshold. AHP delay was determined as the latency between the AP peak and AHP peak. The AP maximal rise and decay slopes were defined as the maximal and minimal values, respectively, of the time derivative of the voltage. The inflection rate was calculated as the slope of the phase-plane plot at AP threshold.

Behavioural tests

Behavioural tests were performed by the personnel of the Mouse Behavior Core Facility at San Raffaele Scientific Institute. Different cohorts of mice were tested in a total of eight rounds of behaviour, in which control mice were always tested. All the mice performed all behavioural tasks in the sequence and time indicated in the 'Results' section. Operators were blinded to the genotype during both the testing and the analysis. Mice experiencing tonic-clonic seizures during a test were excluded from the analysis of that specific test.

Marble burying test

Twelve glass marbles were placed on the bedding surface of a rat cage filled with 5 cm of fresh litter cage in three equidistant rows of four marbles each. Each mouse was placed into the centre of the cage with marbles and after 20 min they were returned to their home cages without moving or dislodging the marbles. The number of buried marbles was counted. A marble was considered buried when at least 2/3 of its surface was covered by litter. Litter was changed and marbles washed after each use.

How Do I Take Jaimiess?

1. Take one pill every day at the same time. If you miss pills you could get pregnant. This includes starting the pack late. The more pills you miss, the more likely you are to get pregnant.

2. Many women have spotting or light bleeding, or may feel sick to their stomach during the first few months of taking Jaimiess. If you feel sick to your stomach, do not stop taking the pill. The problem will usually go away. If it doesn't go away, check with your healthcare provider.

3. Missing pills can also cause spotting or light bleeding, even when you take the missed pills later. On the days you take 2 pills to make up for missed pills, you could also feel a little sick to your stomach.

4. If you have trouble remembering to take Jaimiess, talk to your healthcare provider about how to make pill-taking easier or about using another method of birth control.

Before You Start Taking Jaimiess

Decide what time of day you want to take your pill. It is important to take it at about the same time every day.
Look at your Extended-Cycle Tablet Dispenser. Your Tablet Dispenser consists of a Tri-Fold Blister card that hold 91 individually sealed pills (a 13-week or 91-day cycle). The 91 pills consist of 84 peach and 7 yellow pills. The first two blister card sections each contain 28 peach pills (4 rows of 7 pills). The third blister card section contains 35 pills consisting of 28 peach pills (4 rows of 7 pills) and 7 yellow pills (1 row of 7 pills).

### Striking long-term beneficial effects of single dose psilocybin and psychedelic mushroom extract in the SAPAP3 rodent model of OCD-like excessive self-grooming [^94b90547]. Molecular Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Behavioral tests

SAPAP3 KO (N = 20) and WT (N = 20) mice underwent a series of behavioral tests before entering the trial. These tests were performed 2–6 days before the initiation of the trial and then 3–5 days after treatment and included the following:

Marble burying test (MBT) was conducted to assess compulsive-like behaviors in HOM SAPAP3 mice compared to WT littermates, and to evaluate the effects of treatments on this behavior. The test was conducted in a quiet room with dim light, to minimize anxiety's effect on behavior. A mouse was placed in a separate transparent cage with a cover, filled with 4.5 cm of new bedding shred, and 20 glass marbles were evenly distributed in a 5 × 4 pattern (while keeping 2 cm distance between marbles and cage). After a 30 min test, the number of covered marbles was determined by considering a marble buried if at least two-thirds of its surface was covered with bedding material.

Open field (OFT) was performed immediately after the MBT to evaluate anxiety levels and locomotor activity and anxiety and the effects of treatments on this behavior. A mouse that spends more time in the periphery area is considered more anxious. The arena consisted of a square wooden arena (50 × 50 × 40 cm) with white walls and floor. In the beginning of the test, a mouse was placed in the arena center and was free to explore it for 10 min. Total duration of time (s) spent in center arena, total duration of time (s) spent in periphery arena, and total distance traveled (cm) were measured by the Ethovision XT-12 Video Tracking System (Noldus Information Technology BV). Before starting a new test, the arena was cleaned with a 70% alcohol solution.

Elevated plus maze (EPM) was performed to evaluate the initial anxiety and the effect of treatments on this behavior. The test apparatus comprises four arms: two enclosed arms with high side walls and two open arms, all converging on a central platform elevated 75 cm above the ground. The animal is placed on the central platform and can explore the arena freely for 6 min. Ethovision XT-12 Video Tracking System (Noldus Information Technology BV) tracks the animals and concludes the total time spent in each arm. Before starting a new EPM test the arena was cleaned with a 70% alcohol solution.

### Electroacupuncture modulates glutamate neurotransmission to alleviate PTSD-like behaviors in a PTSD animal model [^7ffa02fb]. Translational Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

Novel object recognition test

On the 13th day before the sixth EA treatment, the mice were performed novel object recognition test (NOR). Mice were acclimated to the open field apparatus (30 × 30 × 30 cm) without any objects for 10 min. At 1 h after the acclimation period, the mice were returned to the same box containing two identical familiar objects for 10 min. The next day after completion of the last EA treatment, the animals were reintroduced to the same box and allowed to freely explore for 7 min while being recorded by a video camera. The box still contained two objects, but one of the familiar objects was replaced with a novel object that had a different shape but with a similar texture. To assess the object preference, the object preference ratio was calculated using the following equation: object preference ratio (%) = (T novel)/(T novel + T familiar) × 100. During the probe trial of this behavioral test, it was expected that the total exploration time (T novel + T familiar) would exceed 10 s. If the total exploration time was less than 10 s, the mouse was excluded from the analysis.

Open field test

The open field test (OFT) is typically used to assess emotion and locomotor activity. For the second set of animals, the OFT was conducted on the next day after the fifth EA treatment. The mice were individually placed in an open field apparatus with black walls and a floor (30 × 30 × 30 cm) and allowed to freely explore the environment for 20 min. Mouse movements were recorded using a video-based Ethovision XT System (Noldus Information Technology BV). The locomotor activity of mice was assessed by measuring the total distance and duration of movement within the box. The exploratory activity was evaluated by counting the total number of line crossings. To assess anxiety-like behavior, the time spent in the central zone of the open field apparatus was measured as the anxiety index.

Marble-burying test

For the second set of animals, the marble-burying test (MBT) was conducted on the day following completion of the sixth EA treatment. Twenty glass marbles were placed equidistantly in a 5 × 4 pattern within the testing cage. The mice were allowed to freely explore the cage with marbles for 20 min. The anxiety index was evaluated based on the number of marbles buried by mice. A marble was considered to be buried when at least two-thirds of its size was covered with a burying substrate.

He studied at the Chase Art School and then went on to the National Academy of Design and the Art Students League, where he worked under Thomas Fogarty, George Bridgman, and Frank Vincent Dumond. "In those days there wasn't the cleavage between fine arts and illustration that there is today", Rockwell wrote. "It was the end of what you might call the golden age of illustration". Frederick Remington had just died, and photographs were crowding the magazine and book publishing scene. Perhaps people had stopped demanding fine illustration, he thought; "You can't conduct a golden age with a heart of copper".

Rockwell was scorned for becoming an illustrator, even by his fellow students. "You know, if I worked as hard as you do, I could be as good as Velásquez", one of them would joke. "Why don't you?" Rockwell would respond and return to some vexing problem at hand, how to draw an eye for instance so it did not look "like a fried egg".

"I can't say who has influenced me really. Or at least I can't say how the artists I have admired have influenced me… Ever since I can remember, Rembrandt has been my favorite artist. Vermeer, Breughel, Velásquez, Canaletto; Dürer, Holbein, Ingres as draftsmen; Matisse, Klee―these are a few of the others I admire now. During my student days I studied closely the works of Edwin Austin Abbey, J.C. and Frank Leyendecker, Howard Pyle, Sargent, Whistler".

"I had a secret ambition: a cover on the Saturday Evening Post. In those days the cover of the Post was the greatest show window in America for an illustrator… 'Must be two million people look at that cover'. After the Post, offers came from other magazines: Life, Judge, The People's Popular Monthly. "One of the most difficult problems in painting magazine covers is thinking up ideas which a majority of the readers will understand… And it's darned hard to be universal, to find some situation which will strike the farmer, the housewife, the gossip… "

The last day she spoke to me, she was dressed in red sweat pants and a loose purple jersey top with long sleeves. Her nose ran. When I came into her room, she was lying in bed staring at the ceiling. She rarely spoke complete sentences. She never recognized me. I sat next to her and for several moments said nothing.

The room was split in two by a red blanket hung as a curtain. On the other side of the curtain was another bed. Sometimes Mom had roommates, but for the last week or two, no one had occupied the other bed. Full or empty, the other bed held no interest for Mother. The floor was covered in spattered beige tiles.

I enjoyed these moments, sitting quietly next to her — moments stolen from reality, shielded from certainty. I wasn't an immunologist here, just an old woman's son wishing for things that could never be. I reached out and held her hand, thin now with thickened blue veins and knuckles fat from inflammation. She turned to me.

"Hello", I said.

"Hello", she said with obvious pleasure.

Then she lifted my hand to her lips and kissed my finger tips.

"How are you?" I asked because whether someone is dying, bleeding to death from a severed limb, or just finishing a pastrami sandwich, that question inexplicably comes to my lips.

"Fine", she said and turned back to the ceiling, smiling. "I'm fine".

I wiped her nose.

Today, she wore no lipstick, and the aides had taken her bridge from her mouth. Four of her lower front teeth were missing. Her tongue fell through the opening when she spoke and twisted her words.

### The mass of the missing baryons in the X-ray forest of the warm-hot intergalactic medium [^4109f122]. Nature (2005). Excellent credibility.

Recent cosmological measurements indicate that baryons comprise about four per cent of the total mass-energy density of the Universe, which is in accord with the predictions arising from studies of the production of the lightest elements. It is also in agreement with the actual number of baryons detected at early times (redshifts z > 2). Close to our own epoch (z < 2), however, the number of baryons detected add up to just over half (approximately 55 per cent) of the number seen at z > 2 (refs 6–11), meaning that about approximately 45 per cent are 'missing'. Here we report a determination of the mass-density of a previously undetected population of baryons, in the warm-hot phase of the intergalactic medium. We show that this mass density is consistent, within the uncertainties, with the mass density of the missing baryons.

### Does paracetamol improve quality of life, discomfort, pain and neuropsychiatric symptoms in persons with advanced dementia living in long-term care facilities? A randomised double-blind placebo-controlled crossover (Q-PID) trial [^476e56da]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Compliance

Five participants quit study medication in the first period and 11 in the second study period. Reasons for quitting study medication were repeated refusal of study tablets (7 participants) and being in need of (other) pain medication (9 participants). Two participants from the latter group performed much better in the first period, and the nurses detected a clear deterioration in the second period. This caused them to contact the researchers to quit study medication and to continue paracetamol (although unsure which treatment arm the participant was in, the difference between the two periods was evident). After the study ended and after deblinding, these participants indeed turned out to be part of the AB treatment arm (first paracetamol, then placebo). At least two other patients did not stop study medication, but the nurses again saw a clear difference and when paracetamol was continued after the study ended, the participants performed better and were more relaxed.

In the first study period, the median compliance was 92.0% (IQR 80.7–100.0), taking into account participants who died and who stopped study medication during this period. Data for 14 participants on the number of residual tablets at the end of the first period was missing, due to the absence of the study medication jars on the LTCF units after the study period ended. In the second study period, the median compliance was 84.0% (IQR 67.5–98.1), taking into account participants who died and who stopped study medication during this and previous study period. Compliance data for 18 participants was missing for the same reason as in period 1. The medication administration records showed better compliance than the residual tablet counting, indicating an imbalance between recording the study medication as 'given' and actually giving it.

### Is fragmentation of prostate core biopsies inevitable? a quality improvement initiative [^42ab11eb]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Context —

Core biopsies are standard of care for diagnosis and surveillance of prostate cancer. Fragmentation makes numeric assessment of cancer challenging and increases risk of inaccurate staging, with direct implications on management.

Objective —

To determine factors responsible for fragmentation at our institution.

Design —

Prostate core biopsies performed at 2 hospital sites during 1 week were prospectively identified. Biopsies were received in multipart formalin jars, either mounted on a nonadherent dressing pad (Telfa, Medtronic Inc) or freely suspended, and grossed by experienced pathologists' assistants. Fragmentation was defined as the difference between the number of cores sent by the clinician and the number of cores counted by the pathologist on microscopy.

Results —

Forty-six cases (15 benign; 31 malignant) with 535 specimen jars were identified, of which 309 of 535 (57.8%) had > 1 biopsy core per jar; 230 of 535 (43%) were received mounted on Telfa and 185 of 535 (34.6%) had histologic evidence of adenocarcinoma. Overall fragmentation rate was 157 of 535 (29.3%). Lowest fragmentation rate was seen when 1 core was submitted per jar regardless of mounting method (31 of 226; 14% for single versus 126 of 309; 41% for > 1 per jar; P < .001). For 1 Telfa-mounted core, rate of fragmentation was 5 of 18 (27.8%) versus 26 of 203 (12.8%) when unmounted (P = 0.24). Significant increase in fragmentation of Telfa-mounted cores was seen when there were 3 per jar (32 of 70; 46% mounted fragmented versus 9 of 47; 19% unmounted fragmented specimens; P = 0.01).

Conclusions —

Submission of > 1 biopsy core per jar and use of Telfa for mounting are associated with increased fragmentation. We recommend limiting submission to 1 core per jar and avoid mounting cores on Telfa pads.

### VecTest as diagnostic and surveillance tool for west nile virus in dead birds [^8d123956]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

In a class II biosafety cabinet at the Wildlife Pathology Unit, 0.25 mL of each swab solution was transferred to a conical microfuge tube (supplied with the kit), the VecTest strip was inserted into the tube, and results were read in the fluorescent light of the safety cabinet 15–30 min later. According to manufacturer's instructions, the development of a reddish purple line, in both the test and control zones of the VecTest strip, was recorded as a positive result. Any test strip that did not develop a control line was discarded; then, 0.25 mL of the original solution was pipetted into another microfuge tube, and a new strip was used to test the solution. Observations on the intensity of positive results, as well as descriptions of any unusual features, were also recorded.

Swab samples in VecTest buffer solution that were not tested on the day of collection were refrigerated overnight at 4°C. If a delay of > 24 h occurred before testing, solutions were frozen at –20°C. To determine the effects of refrigeration on the buffer solution, a limited number of swab samples were held at 4°C for intervals of 3 to 7 days. A similar study was conducted by freezing swab solutions at –20°C for 2 days to 7 months to determine if freezing would affect VecTest results. Most VecTest strips used throughout the study contained a single antigen-binding site specific for WNV; however, 500 test strips used during June and July 2003, and in July 2004, included additional test zones for eastern equine encephalitis and St. Louis encephalitis.

Tissues for RT-PCR testing were obtained during necropsy with single-use sterile disposable scalpels and stainless steel forceps and scissors. After use, forceps and scissors were placed in Promicidal disinfectant (Chemsearch Industries, Irving, TX) for later cleaning and steam autoclaving at 120°C for 20 min at 1.0 kg/cm². Harvested tissues were immediately placed in individual 1-oz plastic jars and capped. Jar lids were labeled with the individual specimen number, species name, and tissue type, and the jar sides with the specimen number. The plastic jars containing the tissues were then frozen at –80°C before transport to the state Arbovirus Laboratory for RT-PCR testing.

### Child sex trafficking and commercial sexual exploitation: health care needs of victims [^bd1e11a5]. Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

Introduction — epidemiology and health risks describes human trafficking as a major global health and human rights problem with reported victims in at least 152 countries and an unknown total number with estimates into the millions. Women and children predominate, with findings from 1 global study reporting up to 49% of the victims were women and 33% were children. Violence and psychological manipulation are common, and victims are at increased risk of injury, sexual assault, infectious diseases, substance misuse, untreated chronic medical conditions, malnutrition, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), major depression and other mental health disorders, homicide, and suicide, and medical providers are in a unique position to help potential victims.

### Concizumab (Alhemo) [^2b691df9]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

If you want to see more accurately how much Alhemo is left in your pen, turn the dose selector until it stops. The dose pointer will line up with the number of mg left in the pen.

If the dose counter shows 80 mg, at least 80 mg is left in the pen. If the dose counter shows less than 80 mg, the number shown in the dose counter is the number of mg left in your pen. In the example below, the dose counter shows 34 mg, so there is 34 mg of Alhemo left in the pen.

Storing Alhemo

Before first use:
Store unused Alhemo pens in the refrigerator between 36°F to 46°F (2°C to 8°C).
After first use:
Store the Alhemo pen in the refrigerator between 36°F to 46°F (2°C to 8°C) or at room temperature no warmer than 86°F (30°C) for up to 28 days.
Write the date of first use in the space provided on the carton.
Throw away (discard) the Alhemo pen 28 days after first opening even if some medicine is left in the pen.
Store Alhemo with the cap on and keep it in the original carton to protect from light.
Do not store Alhemo in direct sunlight and keep away from direct heat.
When stored in the refrigerator, do not store the pen directly next to the cooling element (the part that cools the refrigerator).
Do not freeze Alhemo.
Do not use Alhemo if it has been frozen or if it has been stored above 86°F (30°C).

### Errors in results, table 3, and eTables 2 and 3 [^8430e1c7]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

In the Original Investigation titled "Association of Pharmaceutical Industry Marketing of Opioid Products With Mortality From Opioid-Related Overdoses", published January 18, 2019, the adjusted relative risk (aRR) and 95% CI for the number of payments per capita were inadvertently switched with those for the number of physicians receiving marketing per capita in the second to last paragraph of the Results section and in the 2 columns representing model B and model C in Table 3. The effect sizes for the 2 main independent variables in the 2 columns in Table 3 are comparable (number of payments per 1000 population per year: aRR, 11.08; 95% CI, 9.31–12.86; number of physicians receiving payments per 1000 population per year: aRR, 13.59; 95% CI, 11.48–15.71). Thus, the study's conclusions remain unchanged. Also, from "Age group" on down to "Metropolitan area", in the 2 columns representing model B and model C in Table 3, the aRRs and 95% CIs were inadvertently switched. Similarly, eTable 3 had columns that were inadvertently switched but with comparable effect sizes, again leaving the study's conclusions unchanged. Finally, the title of eTable 2 has been corrected to better reflect that death counts rather than mortality rates were used as a dependent variable in statistical modeling. This article has been corrected.

Add-On Combination Therapy with Metformin

A total of 637 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus participated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of JARDIANCE in combination with metformin.

Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus inadequately controlled on at least 1,500 mg of metformin per day entered an open-label 2-week placebo run-in. At the end of the run-in period, patients who remained inadequately controlled and had an HbA1c between 7% and 10% were randomized to placebo, JARDIANCE 10 mg, or JARDIANCE 25 mg.

At Week 24, treatment with JARDIANCE 10 mg or 25 mg daily provided statistically significant reductions in HbA1c (p-value < 0.0001), FPG, and body weight compared with placebo (see Table 6).

At Week 24, the systolic blood pressure was statistically significantly reduced compared to placebo by -4.1 mmHg (placebo-corrected, p-value < 0.0001) for JARDIANCE 10 mg and -4.8 mmHg (placebo-corrected, p-value < 0.0001) for JARDIANCE 25 mg.

Initial Combination Therapy with Metformin

A total of 1,364 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus participated in a double-blind, randomized, active-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of JARDIANCE in combination with metformin as initial therapy compared to the corresponding individual components.

Treatment-naïve patients with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus entered an open-label placebo run-in for 2 weeks. At the end of the run-in period, patients who remained inadequately controlled and had an HbA1c between 7% and 10.5% were randomized to one of 8 active-treatment arms: JARDIANCE 10 mg or 25 mg; metformin 1,000 mg, or 2,000 mg; JARDIANCE 10 mg in combination with 1,000 mg or 2,000 mg metformin; or JARDIANCE 25 mg in combination with 1,000 mg or 2,000 mg metformin.

At Week 24, initial therapy of JARDIANCE in combination with metformin provided statistically significant reductions in HbA1c (p-value < 0.01) compared to the individual components (see Table 7).

### The international glossary on infertility and fertility care, 2017 [^8f44a5a2]. Fertility and Sterility (2017). Medium credibility.

International glossary on infertility and fertility care — key definitions include: Spontaneous abortion/miscarriage is the spontaneous loss of an intra-uterine pregnancy prior to 22 completed weeks of gestational age. Stillbirth is the death of a fetus before complete expulsion or extraction after 28 completed weeks of gestational age and is determined when the separated fetus does not breathe or show any other evidence of life such as heartbeat, umbilical cord pulsation, or definite movement of voluntary muscles. Stillbirth rate is the number of stillbirths per 1000 total births (stillbirths plus live births). Time to pregnancy (TTP) is the time taken to establish a pregnancy, measured in months or in numbers of menstrual cycles. Total delivery rate with at least one live birth counts the total number of deliveries with at least one live birth resulting from one initiated or aspirated ART cycle, including only cycles in which fresh and/or frozen embryos are transferred and allowing more than one delivery from one initiated or aspirated cycle if that occurs until all embryos are used; the delivery of a singleton, twin or other multiple pregnancy is registered as one delivery, and in the absence of complete data, the total delivery rate is often estimated. Total fertility rate (TFR) is the average number of live births per woman. Total sperm count is the calculated total number of sperm in the ejaculate, defined as semen volume multiplied by the sperm concentration determined from an aliquot of semen. Teratozoospermia is a reduced percentage of morphologically normal sperm in the ejaculate below the lower reference limits, and when reporting results the reference criteria should be specified. Trisomy denotes an abnormal number of chromosome copies with three homologous chromosomes rather than the normal two, and the majority of human embryos with trisomies are incompatible with life. Unisomy denotes loss of a single chromosome yielding a single copy rather than the normal two, and the majority of unisomies in human embryos are incompatible with life. Unexplained infertility refers to infertility in couples with apparently normal ovarian function, Fallopian tubes, uterus, cervix and pelvis with adequate coital frequency, and apparently normal testicular function, genito-urinary anatomy and a normal ejaculate; the potential for this diagnosis depends on the methodologies used and/or those available.

In a recent article published in The Lancet, investigators studied the impact of daily aspirin use on subsequent cancer deaths. Utilizing data from more than 25,000 patients enrolled in 8 large trials, which were originally intended to study the impact of daily aspirin use on the incidence of cardiovascular events, the authors found a substantial decrease in risk of fatal solid organ malignancies. In particular, the risk reduction was specific to adenocarcinomas. The findings from this study are highly relevant to the thoracic surgeon, with adenocarcinomas of the lung and esophagus among those tumors demonstrating the most profound risk reduction.

### Don't lay your eggs all in one basket: brood parasitism as a survival strategy [^c77bd6c9]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

John James Audubon (1785–1851). Cow-pen Bird, Plate XCIX (99) Engraved from watercolor. 19.5 × 12.25 in/49.53 × 31.12 cm. Images from Archives Service Center, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA

This month's cover image, 1 Plate 99 from Birds of America (printed in stages during 1827−1838) by American ornithologist, naturalist, and painter John James Audubon (1785–1851), shows a pair of oft-vilified brown-headed cowbirds. This painting appears in the book as one of 435 life-sized watercolors that were reproduced from Audubon's hand-engraved plates. In this painting, he portrays the birds frozen in act of foraging, a technique he honed from observing birds where they lived. Audubon's own words best describe the work: "Male with the head and neck sooty-brown, the body black, glossed with green, the fore part of the back with blue. Female considerably smaller, greyish-brown, the lower parts lighter".

The genus of this bird, Molothrus ater — as well as the bronze-headed variant Molothrus aeneus — comes from Molothrus, the Greek work meaning vagabond or parasite. Although there are other bird species that prey on the parental skills of their feathered neighbors by laying eggs in their nests, only birds of those two species practice obligate parasitism in North America, placing them among approximately one percent of avian species worldwide.

Before cowbirds — which are also variously known as cow-pen birds, cow buntings, or buffalo birds — followed cattle, they tracked bison herds across the Great Plains, where they were sustained by the copious insects. Naturalists have ventured that cowbirds adapted to this nomadic existence by becoming brood parasites and depositing their eggs in nests built and incubated by birds of other species. Incubation for birds is analogous to pregnancy for mammals, providing warmth, protection, and food to the developing embryo. This process can involve establishing and defending a territory, nest building, and collecting food not for individual consumption, but for feeding the newly hatched chicks.

### Methodologies for the development of CHEST guidelines and expert panel reports [^3afb239e]. Chest (2014). Medium credibility.

CHEST grading of recommendations — the grading system encompasses two dimensions: balance of benefits to harms, risks, or burdens (including confidence in effect estimates) and the level of evidence supporting the recommendation; recommendations are strong when benefits clearly outweigh harms or vice versa and may include a strong negative recommendation; strong recommendations (Grade 1) use the language "we recommend", whereas when benefits and harms are closely balanced and further research could change the direction or strength, it is considered weak and statements read, "we suggest"; when benefits clearly outweigh harms most patients would choose the intervention and the recommendation is Grade 1, but with considerable variability in preferences recommendations are weaker, ie, Grade 2; the other dimension reflects the quality of the body of evidence scored A, B, or C.

At baseline, 81% of patients were treated with ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or ARNI, 86% with beta-blockers, 38% with MRAs, and 86% with diuretics.

The primary endpoint was the time to first event of either CV death or HHF. First and recurrent HHF was assessed as a key secondary endpoint.

JARDIANCE was superior in reducing the risk of the primary composite endpoint compared with placebo, mostly through a reduction in hospitalization for heart failure. JARDIANCE reduced the risk of first and recurrent HHF (see Table 17 and Figures 10 and 11).

### Placental endocrine function shapes cerebellar development and social behavior [^04fec83c]. Nature Neuroscience (2021). High credibility.

Rotarod

The accelerating rotarod performance test is a standard rodent assay for motor-associated functions such as coordination and balance. A 4-d testing paradigm (three sessions per day) was performed as previously describedwith a continuously accelerating rod that forces animals to modulate their balance. For the first 2 d, animals were placed on the rod, which accelerated from 4 to 40 r.p.m. in 180 s. The test was stopped when the animal fell off the rod, was unable to maintain coordinated movements or 180 s passed. Additionally, if animals displayed 'cartwheeling', or clutching the rod and circling without walking, the test was stopped. To increase the challenge, for days 3–4 the acceleration of the rod increased from 8 to 80 r.p.m. in 180 s. The latency to fall from the rod and terminal velocity were then recorded. Linear regression analysis on data from each individual mouse was used to estimate initial motor coordination (given by the intercept) and learning rate (given by the slope).

Spontaneous behavior/stereotypies

Assessment of repetitive behavior was done to test autism-like behavior. Mice were allowed to habituate to the testing room before placement in a new, empty cage with bedding materials. A video camera was set with a lateral view to record spontaneous behavior for 15 min. Videos were manually scored for time spent engaging in behaviors, including digging, gnawing, grooming, rearing and jumping.

Marble burying

The anxiety and stereotypic and/or obsessive–compulsive-like behavior components of ASD-like behavior can be assessed in mice by their behavioral responses to new 'diggable' media, in the marble burying test. This test was performed in a clean, large (26 ×16 cm) cage filled with 5 cm of bedding and 12 glass marbles evenly spaced on the bedding surface. The animal was left to explore the cage for 30 min undisturbed. Marbles covered 2/3 or more with bedding were counted as buried.

### Guidance on community viral load: a family of measures, definitions, and method for calculation [^31d7d596]. CDC (2011). Medium credibility.

Table 2 — types of viral load (VL) analyses and measures — describes mean-based metrics that average per-case results. One metric is calculated by "Determine the most recent VL for each case, total the values of those VLs, and divide by the number of cases with a VL" and indicates "The average number of virus particles in a population; can be influenced by large outliers; useful for comparisons between subpopulations (e.g., disparities)". A log-transformed variant uses "Log transform the most recent VL for each case, average the log transformed values, total the average values, and divide by the number of cases with a VL" and "The log transformation will provide a stable estimate by reducing the influence of outliers; tightens the association of trend between decline in CVL and new diagnoses". Another metric based on the per-case mean is computed by "Determine the mean VLs for each case, total the values of those mean VLs, and divide by the number of cases with a VL" and "Provides an average of the average number of virus particles per case; this may reflect a greater influence of those individuals with multiple measurements and those who were started on ART and trended towards suppression within 1 year". For starred metrics, " The denominator includes all viral load results, including undetectable viral load".

### 2024 John J bonica award lecture: less is more [^23efc073]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

'Less is More' reflects the idea of Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, who only retained the essentials in his designs. This principle is also applicable in different areas of pain medicine. Several pioneers have worked hard to introduce the multidisciplinary approach to obtain the most appropriate treatment for the patient. Most of those pioneers received the Bonica Award before me, and I am happy that those persons mentored me and stimulated me in understanding pain management and developing my career. Pain management has known a great evolution, from accepting pain because of an underlying disease to recognizing pain as the fifth vital sign. The rise in interest in (interventional) pain management evolved parallel to the introduction of evidence-based medicine. Most physicians welcome reviews summarizing the available literature. There are many pitfalls of systematic reviews and meta-analyses, such as the interpretation of the information, which is predominantly done by epidemiologists, who have little clinical background to make a distinction between the effect of the treatment in different diagnoses. Guidelines are based on correct diagnosis, weighing the potential for complications against the anticipated benefits, are progressively introduced and should guide physicians in establishing a treatment plan. A group of physicians normally prepares these guidelines. The golden rule in the treatment selection is 'Less is More'.

### Tasty bits a Dutch treat [^0f8fd1d7]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Claesz painted scenes with bowls, glasses, and other objects luxuriously appointed and filled with spices, fruit, and allusions to the fleeting nature of earthly pleasures and the vanity of life. He pioneered a nearly monochromatic palette with subdued hues and achieved remarkable naturalism by focusing on how light affects a scene and how objects are perceived against each other and as reflections on highly polished surfaces. Along with still life greats Willem Heda and Clara Peeters, he created the subtle and refined banquet style identified with the Haarlem art scene.

In Still Life with Turkey Pie, on this month's cover, the muted colors alone betray Claesz' genius. They allow the light to reflect off the tumbler of white wine, the nautilus shell goblet, the plates, even the glistening olives and grapes. A glimpse of the room can be had on the pewter pitcher. The turkey, having supplied the namesake feast, also donated its light-streaked feathers and beak as decorative headdress for the raised pie.

The composition engages the senses and turns a still life into a dynamic one, a banquet in progress, even without humans. We are invited to sample. A plate and knife balance off the edge of the table within reach, a serving spoon rests atop the half-eaten mince pie. The lemon is half peeled. The tablecloth, live with folds and shadows of objects and set against a rug, bleeds to the edge. A Delft bowl rests invitingly at an angle filled with fruit and crowned with leaves and twigs. The formality is broken by bread placed directly on the cloth, along with a star fruit and nuts cracked and strewn between the plates along with slices of lemon and empty seashells.

### Neurodevelopment and metabolism in the maternal-placental-fetal unit [^a94f22ff]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Disturbances in maternal, placental, and fetal metabolism are associated with developmental outcomes. Associations of maternal, placental, and fetal metabolism with subsequent neurodevelopmental outcomes in the child are understudied.

Objective

To investigate the metabolic associations within the maternal-placental-fetal unit and subsequent neurodevelopmental outcomes in younger siblings of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cohort study was conducted within a subset of the Markers of Autism Risk in Babies, Learning Early Signs (MARBLES) cohort. MARBLES is a prospective birth cohort of younger siblings of children with ASD assessed for neurodevelopmental outcomes at approximately age 36 months. Participants in MARBLES were recruited through the UC Davis MIND Institute. This subset of the MARBLES cohort included younger siblings born between 2009 and 2015. Maternal third trimester serum, placental tissue, and umbilical cord serum samples were collected from participants. Only pregnancies with at least 2 of these sample types were included in this analysis. Data analysis was conducted from March 1, 2023, to March 15, 2024.

Exposures

Quantitative metabolomics analysis was conducted on maternal third trimester serum, as well as placental tissue and umbilical cord serum collected at delivery.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Using the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule and Mullen Scales of Early Learning, outcomes were classified as ASD, other nontypical development (non-TD), and typical development (TD).

Results

This analysis included 100 maternal serum samples, 141 placental samples, and 124 umbilical cord serum samples from 152 pregnancies (median [IQR] maternal age, 34.6 [30.8–38.3] years; median [IQR] gestational age, 39.0 [38.6–39.7] weeks; 87 [57.2%] male infants). There was no evidence that the maternal third trimester serum metabolome was significantly associated with the other metabolomes. The placental and cord serum metabolomes were highly correlated (first latent variate pair: R² = 0.75; P < .001) and the variate scores for each tissue were significantly associated with reduced risk of non-TD (placenta: relative risk [RR], 0.13; 95% CI, 0.02–0.71; cord: RR, 0.13; 95% CI, 0.03–0.70) but not ASD (placenta: RR, 1.09; 95% CI, 0.42–2.81; cord: RR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.23–1.73) compared with the TD reference group.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this cohort study of children with high familial risk of ASD, placental and cord serum metabolism at delivery were highly correlated. Furthermore, placental and cord serum metabolic profiles were associated with risk of non-TD.

### An important cardiac surgery milestone: the first known stopped-heart operation [^1a37df44]. JTCVS Techniques (2021). Medium credibility.

Colored illustrations of the original drawings of the first cardioplegic arrest operation.

Central Message

The first known stopped-heart operation, performed by Donald Effler, MD, and Larry Groves, MD, was a precursor to what has become a major contribution to cardiovascular care of patients.

See Commentaries on pagesand.

On May 6, 1953, John Gibbon, MD, performed the first heart operation using a heart–lung machine without stopping the heart; afterward, various inflow occlusion types of operations continued to be performed, and C. Walton Lillehei was using cross-circulation for heart operations. Meanwhile, Melrose and his team were experimenting in the laboratory on inducing cardiac arrest with potassium. On February 17, 1956, Donald Effler, MD, and Larry Groves, MD, performed the first documented operation in which the heart was stopped with aortic occlusion and potassium citrate infusion on a cardiopulmonary bypass pump (built by Willem Kolff, MD) with a 17-minute pump time. There is no indication from the report of the first 3 operations done with potassium arrest of the heart on cardiopulmonary bypass. In addition, there is no record of Effler and Groves previously doing ventricular septal defect (VSD) closures with either cross-circulation or cardiopulmonary bypass without stopping the heart.

### 2024 American Heart Association and American red cross guidelines for first aid [^fc965057]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Jellyfish stings — Jellyfish stings are common and cause local pain; in North America, most people are treated at the scene, though some require more advanced medical care. Allergic reactions can occur but are uncommon. Treatment data are limited, with few clinical trials and uncertain species responses, but within these limitations, hot water immersion appears to be the most effective for pain relief.

Early reports told us that the first pericardiotomy was performed by Baron Dominique Jean Larrey, Napoleon's chief military surgeon. In this article, we reveal a previous operation of that kind and its publication by Francisco Romero, who had a 9-year head start over Larrey's performance. The aim of this article was to briefly review the two-century-old history of pericardial fenestration.

### Enlightenment via simulation: "crone-ology' s" first woman [^45d3a5ec]. Journal of Endourology (2010). Low credibility.

A little known 18th century midwife, Angélique Marguerite Le Boursier (1715–1794) may well be the true founder of modern surgical simulation. This fiercely independent medical practitioner stood equally amongst the many enlightened minds of this period and fought with every modern method to reduce infant/maternal mortality during childbirth. Her original textbook Abrégé utilized some of the first color anatomical illustrations, her method of teaching complex birthing techniques to peasant woman throughout France, and most notably her birthing simulator complete with fluids (wet ware) were all available for close scrutiny. The color illustrations in Abrégé remain profoundly effective but the only existent models of her simulator are even more remarkable. Le Boursier du Coudray sought to bring education to the woman and physicians in villages and towns throughout France in response to the population crisis and the high birth morbidity and mortality. Her teaching methods affected untold thousands of medical practitioners, from midwives to surgeons. Voltaire wrote about her and she became an icon of progressive France, but remained ostracized by much of the conventional medical practitioners. She continued to train midwives for 23 years before retiring at the age of nearly 70. Madame du Coudray began to write, illustrate and simulate in the mid 18th century and obtained unprecedented success in bringing to the public the humane practices of modern childbirth with relevant understanding of anatomy and physiology. She is the matron not only of modern simulation methods in healthcare but was the epitome of professional healthcare commitment, educating approximately 10,000 students regardless of social status for free.

### Impact of bottle size on in-home consumption of wine: a randomized controlled cross-over trial [^cedf7af1]. Addiction (2020). Medium credibility.

At the end of the first 14‐day intervention period, households returned to their 'usual behaviour' to allow any remaining study wine to be finished. During this period, there were no constraints on bottle size or types of wine that households could drink.

Once household representatives confirmed that they had consumed all their wine or were close to having consumed all their wine, they were e‐mailed a second questionnaire directing them to the wine bottle size and quantity they were required to buy for their second 14‐day intervention period. Households were required to order the same volume, but not necessarily the same wine brands that they had ordered for the first intervention period.

At the end of the study, all household representatives were invited to complete an end‐of study questionnaire comprising five questions on what they thought the study was about and their attitudes towards the two bottle sizes. Household representatives were then fully debriefed on the true aim of the study.

Households received £240 in total for completing the study in full. There was no additional compensation for the wine purchases made during the study.

Outcome measures

Primary outcome

Volume of study wine consumed (in millilitres) during each intervention period for each bottle size (75 versus 50 cl), which was estimated through returned photographs of all study wine bottles purchased. Full details on the procedures followed to determine consumption from photographs of partially empty bottles are provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan.

Secondary outcome

The mean number of days taken to consume each 1.5 litres of wine during each intervention was estimated from the study start‐ and finish‐dates reported on submitted photographs.

### Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections in hospitalized… [^390a5893]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

* Data were used to identify the total number of CAP cases, M. pneumoniae–associated CAP cases, and CAP cases with administration of an antimicrobial agent effective against M. pneumoniae †† during January 2018–December 2024. ICD-10 codes used to identify M. pneumoniae CAP were validated by comparing discharge diagnosis codes with laboratory results at one hospital. M. pneumoniae–associated CAP decreased in early 2020, remained low through 2023, and increased in all age groups in 2024. In 2024, compared with 2018–2023, the proportion of CAP attributed to M. pneumoniae increased the most among children aged 12–23 months, followed by 0–11 months, 2–5 years, 13–18 years, and 6–12 years. Forty-four deaths occurred among children with M. pneumoniae CAP, including 29 during 2018–2023 and 15 in 2024. The median age of patients who died from M. pneumoniae CAP was 12 years. In addition, although the number of M. pneumoniae infections among children aged < 2 years was lower than that in older children and adolescents, M. pneumoniae accounted for approximately one half of CAP among children aged 0–11 months and 12–23 months at peaks in November and July 2024, respectively. Limitations The findings in this report are subject to at least four limitations. First, passively collected resource use data are subject to possible biases from test ordering and medical coding practices. A limited evaluation at a single hospital indicated that most. †United States, 2018–2024 Abbreviation: CAP = community-acquired pneumonia. The number of CAP cases that were not associated with M. pneumoniae infection was calculated by subtracting the number of M. pneumoniae CAP cases from the total number of CAP cases.

### Methylprednisolone as adjunct to endovascular thrombectomy for large-vessel occlusion stroke: the MARVEL randomized clinical trial [^9d7b37ab]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

The study MARVEL (original research) was published by MARVEL Trial Authors for the MARVEL Investigators and colleagues in 2024 in the journal JAMA. This study is related to the following diseases: Acute ischemic stroke. In the MARVEL (original research) study, the trial question was: what is the role of adjunctive methylprednisolone added to endovascular thrombectomy in patients with AIS due to large vessel occlusion? In the MARVEL (original research) study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the MARVEL (original research) study, the population was: 1680 patients (727 female, 953 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with stroke and proximal intracranial large vessel occlusion presenting within 24 hours of time last known to be well. The key exclusion criteria were ICH; mRS score ≥ 2 before onset; pregnancy; allergy to contrast agents or corticosteroids; uncontrolled SBP > 185 mmHg or DBP > 110 mmHg. In the MARVEL (original research) study, the interventions were: n = 839 methylprednisolone (methylprednisolone 2 mg/kg IV daily, maximum dose of 160 mg, for 3 days) n = 841 placebo (matching intravenous placebo for 3 days). In the MARVEL (original research) study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in median 90-day mRS score (3 points vs. 3 points; GenOR 1.1, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.25). In the MARVEL (original research) study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in mRS score of 0–4 at day 90 (71.5% vs. 66.2%; RR 1.07, 95% CI 1 to 1.14) No significant difference in mRS score of 0–2 at day 90 (44.1% vs. 40.9%; RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.19) No significant difference in mRS score of 0–1 or return to premorbid score at day 90 (26.7% vs. 26.5%; RR 0.99, 99% CI 0.84 to 1.16). In the MARVEL (original research) study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in radiologic ICH, gastrointestinal bleeding within 7 days after endovascular thrombectomy. significant differences in death (23.2% vs. 28.5%), symptomatic ICH (8.6% vs. 11.7%), pneumonia (46.5% vs. 55.4%). In the MARVEL (original research) study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with stroke and proximal intracranial large vessel occlusion presenting within 24 hours of time last known to be well, methylprednisolone was not superior to placebo with respect to median 90-day mRS score.

Basic stereological measurements — first-order parameters and probes identify that "First-order parameters are volume (three-dimensional [3D]), surface (two-dimensional [2D]), length (one-dimensional [1D]), and number (zero-dimensional [0D])". Measurements "are performed using geometric test probes, such as points (0D), lines (1D), planes (2D), or volumes (3D)". These probes create countable events in the image, and "Raw counts provide ratios… that are multiplied by the reference space volume to obtain absolute measures for the lung or subcompartment".

### How many polyps are there? [^30e47506]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Frequently, there is disagreement between consecutive endoscopies about the true number of mucosal lesions.

Objective

To develop a simple means to estimate the total number of mucosal lesions and the number of lesions missed during consecutive endoscopies.

Design

Probability modeling of endoscopic outcomes.

Patients

Subjects undergoing 2 consecutive endoscopies.

Main Outcome Measurements

Total number of mucosal lesions and number of missed lesions.

Results

If a represents the number of lesions seen by the first endoscopist, b the number of lesions seen by the second endoscopist, and c the number of identical lesions seen by both, then the total number of lesions is given by T = ab/c, and the number of lesions missed by both is given by M = (a - c)(b - c)/c. The estimated numbers for all lesions and for missed lesions increase as the number of identical lesions seen by both endoscopists decreases. If the number of identical lesions seen by both endoscopists matches the number of lesions found by any one endoscopist, the numbers of estimated and found polyps are identical and the number of missed polyps equals zero.

Limitations

The analysis assumes that both endoscopists work independently of each other and are equally qualified. The formulas also fail to account for varying characteristics of similar lesions.

Conclusion

The analysis presents a simple, unbiased means to estimate the total number of mucosal lesions if 2 consecutive endoscopies yield slightly conflicting results.
