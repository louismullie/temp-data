## Question

A 54-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with a 5-day history of fatigue, nausea, and dark urine. She has a past medical history of hypertension and osteoarthritis. Two weeks ago, she started taking a new prescription for an oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) for her joint pain. On examination, she is jaundiced. Laboratory tests reveal ALT 950 U/L (normal < 40), AST 820 U/L (normal < 40), ALP 210 U/L (normal < 120), and total bilirubin 5.2 mg/dL (normal < 1.2). Her INR is 1.3. She denies alcohol use and has no history of viral hepatitis risk factors. The clinical team suspects drug-induced liver injury (DILI) due to the recent NSAID initiation.

According to the ACG guideline, what is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient's suspected drug-induced liver injury?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the most appropriate next step in managing suspected drug-induced liver injury (DILI) in a 54-year-old woman with jaundice and marked aminotransferase elevations after starting an NSAID two weeks ago. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the DILI pattern and severity. Then, I should verify the immediate management priority, especially whether to stop the suspected drug. Next, I will consider what not to do, including avoiding re-exposure and not starting steroids reflexively. After that, I need to check which competing etiologies must be excluded now versus later. Finally, I will outline monitoring, thresholds for escalation, and when to consider liver biopsy or transplant referral, ensuring each step aligns with ACG guidance.

> Let me first confirm the clinical pattern and severity. The R-value is ALT/ULN divided by ALP/ULN, so 950/40 divided by 210/120 equals roughly 23.8/1.75, which is about 13.6, indicating a hepatocellular injury pattern rather than cholestatic or mixed, and the degree of ALT elevation is more than 10 times the upper limit of normal, which is severe hepatocellular injury by DILI definitions, with jaundice and INR 1.3 suggesting early hepatic dysfunction, though not yet frank coagulopathy at INR greater than 1.5.

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about causality yet. DILI is a diagnosis of exclusion, so I need to ensure we do not anchor prematurely on the NSAID without excluding other causes, but the timing of new NSAID use two weeks prior and the absence of alcohol or viral risk factors strengthens the suspicion of idiosyncratic DILI, and NSAIDs, while less commonly implicated than antimicrobials, are recognized causes of idiosyncratic hepatocellular injury, so the pretest probability is high enough to act while we continue the workup [^1137uz7H] [^113YhNzs] [^115PXCeJ].

> I should confirm the immediate management priority. The ACG guideline issues a strong recommendation to promptly stop the suspected offending agent when DILI is suspected, especially with rapidly rising liver biochemistries or evidence of liver dysfunction, and this applies here given the steep aminotransferase rise and jaundice, so the most appropriate next step is to discontinue the NSAID immediately and avoid re-exposure while we evaluate competing etiologies and monitor for deterioration [^114KiCUz] [^114FZSmK].

> Wait, let me verify what not to do next. I should not start corticosteroids reflexively because routine steroid use is not recommended in idiosyncratic DILI without features of autoimmune hepatitis or immune-mediated injury, and I should not attempt rechallenge with the suspected NSAID, as guidelines strongly advise against re-exposure to a drug likely to have caused hepatotoxicity, particularly when injury is significant or jaundice is present, except in life-threatening scenarios with no alternatives and specialist oversight [^112dukXj] [^111FBHV3] [^112dAfBR].

> Next, I should review which competing etiologies must be excluded now versus soon. Immediately, I need to order acute viral hepatitis serologies for hepatitis A, B, and C, and consider acute hepatitis E serology in the right epidemiologic context, along with autoimmune markers such as ANA, ASMA, and IgG, and I should obtain right upper quadrant ultrasound to exclude biliary obstruction or infiltrative disease, because ACG recommends abdominal imaging at presentation to exclude biliary tract pathology and supports systematic exclusion of viral and autoimmune hepatitis in suspected DILI [^114P8DHX] [^114qVPxb] [^114NAoX3].

> I will now examine the need for additional targeted tests. Given the hepatocellular pattern and severity, I should consider Wilson disease testing if age and clinical context fit, and I should keep Budd-Chiari syndrome in mind if there are risk factors or suggestive features, but I should not delay stopping the drug while awaiting these results, as the priority is withdrawal and stabilization with supportive care [^1128vTKJ] [^114KiCUz].

> Let me think about monitoring and thresholds for escalation. I should recheck liver chemistries frequently, at least every 48 to 72 hours initially, and monitor for signs of acute liver failure such as INR rising above 1.5, encephalopathy, or ascites, because patients with DILI who develop progressive jaundice with or without coagulopathy should be referred to a tertiary center for specialized care and transplant evaluation, and early transplant referral improves outcomes in idiosyncratic DILI–associated ALF [^112nuZvF] [^115PXJvc].

> But wait, what if the liver tests fail to improve as expected. I should double-check the trajectory: in hepatocellular DILI, failure of ALT to fall by more than 50 percent from peak by 30 to 60 days after stopping the drug, or persistent biochemical abnormalities beyond 180 days, should prompt consideration of liver biopsy to evaluate for chronic DILI or alternative diagnoses, and biopsy is also indicated if autoimmune hepatitis remains a competing etiology and immunosuppression is being considered, so I will plan biopsy if the course is atypical or recovery is delayed [^1167V6Ys] [^116dSg1e].

> I need to ensure I address prognosis and counseling. This presentation meets Hy's law criteria with hepatocellular injury, jaundice, and no initial cholestasis, which carries a mortality or transplant risk around 10 percent, so I should counsel the patient on warning signs and arrange close follow-up, and I should document the NSAID as a probable culprit in the medical record to guide future prescribing and avoid re-exposure [^115yQeip] [^112dAfBR].

> Putting this together, the most appropriate next step is to immediately discontinue the NSAID and avoid re-exposure while initiating supportive care, concurrently ordering acute viral hepatitis serologies, autoimmune markers, and right upper quadrant ultrasound to systematically exclude competing etiologies, with close laboratory monitoring and a low threshold for early transplant referral if liver dysfunction progresses, aligning with ACG's strong recommendation to stop the suspected agent promptly in suspected DILI with evidence of liver dysfunction [^114KiCUz] [^114P8DHX] [^114qVPxb] [^112nuZvF].

---

The most appropriate next step is to **immediately discontinue the NSAID** [^114KiCUz] and begin supportive care, as DILI is a diagnosis of exclusion and the first priority is to stop the suspected agent [^1137uz7H]. NSAIDs can cause idiosyncratic hepatocellular injury [^115PXCeJ], and the timing and pattern here are consistent with DILI [^115yQeip]. Continue with **supportive care and close monitoring** of liver tests, and reserve liver biopsy for unresolved cases or when autoimmune hepatitis is suspected [^1167V6Ys]. Do not restart the NSAID, and avoid other hepatotoxins [^112dAfBR].

---

## Immediate management steps

### Discontinuation of the offending agent

Immediately discontinue the NSAID, as this is the cornerstone of DILI management [^114KiCUz] and reduces further liver injury [^114FZSmK]. NSAIDs, including ibuprofen and naproxen, have been implicated in idiosyncratic hepatocellular injury, particularly in susceptible individuals [^notfound].

---

### Supportive care

Provide supportive care with **hydration, antiemetics, and monitoring** for complications such as coagulopathy or encephalopathy [^116HgzpG]. Hospitalization is indicated for severe cases, particularly when there is evidence of hepatic dysfunction (e.g. INR > 1.5, encephalopathy, or significant coagulopathy) [^notfound].

---

### Monitoring and follow-up

Monitor liver enzymes, bilirubin, and coagulation parameters closely, with frequent reassessment of clinical status. Most cases of idiosyncratic DILI resolve spontaneously after withdrawal of the offending agent, but recovery may take weeks to months [^112GHQLy].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation and exclusion of alternative etiologies

DILI is a diagnosis of exclusion; therefore, a **systematic evaluation** is essential to rule out other causes of liver injury [^1137uz7H].

---

### Laboratory tests

- **Viral hepatitis serologies**: Hepatitis A, B, C, and E should be excluded, as these can mimic DILI [^114qVPxb].
- **Autoimmune markers**: Antinuclear antibody (ANA), anti-smooth muscle antibody (ASMA), and immunoglobulin G (IgG) should be checked to exclude autoimmune hepatitis [^1117mkfe].
- **Wilson's disease**: Consider serum ceruloplasmin and copper levels, particularly in younger patients or those with hemolytic anemia [^notfound].
- **Other infections**: CMV, EBV, and HSV testing may be considered if clinically indicated [^114qVPxb].

---

### Imaging studies

Obtain abdominal ultrasound to exclude biliary obstruction, gallstones, or infiltrative liver disease [^114P8DHX]. Additional imaging (CT or MRI) may be considered if ultrasound is inconclusive or if malignancy is suspected [^114xuJeL].

---

### Liver biopsy

Liver biopsy is not routinely required but may be considered in the following scenarios:

- **Unresolving injury**: Persistent elevation of liver enzymes beyond 3 months despite discontinuation of the offending agent [^1167V6Ys].
- **Autoimmune features**: Suspicion of autoimmune hepatitis or overlap syndromes [^1112LSzH].
- **Diagnostic uncertainty**: Cases where the diagnosis remains unclear after exhaustive evaluation [^1146nBVo].

---

## Prognostic assessment

The prognosis of DILI varies with the pattern and severity of liver injury. Hepatocellular injury with jaundice (Hy's law) carries a **significant risk of acute liver failure** and mortality, approximately 10% [^115yQeip]. Prognostic models incorporating MELD score, Charlson comorbidity index, and serum albumin have been suggested to predict 6-month mortality in DILI patients [^114FZSmK].

---

## Patient education and prevention

Patient education is critical to prevent recurrence. Patients should be advised to:

- **Avoid re-exposure**: Strongly avoid re-exposure to the offending NSAID or related agents [^112dAfBR].
- **Report symptoms**: Promptly report any new symptoms of liver injury (e.g. jaundice, dark urine, fatigue) [^115szTaZ].
- **Medication review**: Maintain a comprehensive list of medications, including over-the-counter and herbal supplements, to avoid future hepatotoxic exposures [^112eit57].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Step** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| 1 | Immediately discontinue the NSAID [^114KiCUz] |
| 2 | Provide supportive care and monitor liver function tests closely [^116HgzpG] |
| 3 | Exclude alternative etiologies (viral hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis, Wilson's disease) [^114qVPxb] |
| 4 | Consider liver biopsy if injury persists or autoimmune features are present [^1167V6Ys] |
| 5 | Educate patient to avoid re-exposure and report symptoms promptly [^112dAfBR] |

---

The most appropriate next step is to **immediately discontinue the NSAID** and provide supportive care, while systematically excluding other causes of liver injury. This approach aligns with current ACG guidelines and ensures patient safety by minimizing further liver damage and facilitating recovery [^1137uz7H].

Key concepts for DILI evaluation — Accurate clinical history related to medication exposure and the onset of liver test abnormalities should be obtained when DILI is suspected. DILI is a diagnosis of exclusion, and thus, appropriate competing etiologies should be excluded in a systematic fashion. Based on the R-value at presentation, DILI can be categorized into hepatocellular, cholestatic, or mixed types; this categorization allows testing for competing etiologies in a systematic approach. Liver biopsy can support a clinical suspicion of DILI, provide important information regarding disease severity, and also help exclude competing causes of liver injury.

Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) causality assessment — key concepts are that scoring systems that include RUCAM should not be used as a sole diagnostic tool in isolation because of their suboptimal test reliability and lack of robust validation, but they can be used by the clinicians as a guiding framework for excluding competing etiologies when evaluating a patient with suspected DILI; consensus expert opinion after a thorough evaluation for competing etiologies is the current gold standard for establishing causality in individuals with suspected DILI, but this approach is not widely available and therefore cannot be recommended for clinical practice; and if uncertainty persists after thorough history and evaluation for competing etiologies, clinicians should consider seeking expert consultation to ascertain the diagnosis of DILI and to attribute causality to a suspected agent.

Idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is a rare adverse drug reaction and it can lead to jaundice, liver failure, or even death. Antimicrobials and herbal and dietary supplements are among the most common therapeutic classes to cause DILI in the Western world. DILI is a diagnosis of exclusion and thus careful history taking and thorough work-up for competing etiologies are essential for its timely diagnosis. In this ACG Clinical Guideline, the authors present an evidence-based approach to diagnosis and management of DILI with special emphasis on DILI due to herbal and dietary supplements and DILI occurring in individuals with underlying liver disease.

Idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is common in gastroenterology and hepatology practices, and it can have multiple presentations, ranging from asymptomatic elevations in liver biochemistries to hepatocellular or cholestatic jaundice, liver failure, or chronic hepatitis. Antimicrobials, herbal and dietary supplements, and anticancer therapeutics (e.g., tyrosine kinase inhibitors or immune-checkpoint inhibitors) are the most common classes of agents to cause DILI in the Western world. DILI is a diagnosis of exclusion, and thus, careful assessment for other etiologies of liver disease should be undertaken before establishing a diagnosis of DILI. Model for end-stage liver disease score and comorbidity burden are important determinants of mortality in patients presenting with suspected DILI. DILI carries a mortality rate up to 10% when hepatocellular jaundice is present. Patients with DILI who develop progressive jaundice with or without coagulopathy should be referred to a tertiary care center for specialized care, including consideration for potential liver transplantation. The role of systemic corticosteroids is controversial, but they may be administered when a liver injury event cannot be distinguished between autoimmune hepatitis or DILI or when a DILI event presents with prominent autoimmune hepatitis features.

American College of Gastroenterology guideline methods and recommendation grading: Recommendations are evidence-based whenever possible, with consensus used when evidence is not available, and the ACG Practice Parameters Committee adopted the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system with the GRADE process conducted by 2 formally trained GRADE methodologists. The quality of evidence is graded from high to very low, with high quality indicating that further research is unlikely to change confidence in the estimate of effect and that the true effect lies close to this estimate; moderate quality is associated with moderate confidence although further research could impact the estimate; low quality indicates further study is likely to have an important impact on confidence and would likely change the estimate; and very low quality indicates very little confidence and that the true effect is likely to be substantially different than the estimate. Recommendation strength is defined as strong when the benefits of therapy clearly outweigh the negatives and the result of no action, and conditional when some uncertainty remains about the balance of benefits/potential harm.

Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) — liver biopsy indications are as follows: We recommend performing a liver biopsy if AIH remains a competing etiology and if immunosuppressive therapy is contemplated (strong recommendation, low quality of evidence). We suggest performing a liver biopsy if there is unrelenting rise in liver biochemistries or signs of worsening liver function despite stopping the suspected offending agent (conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence). We suggest performing a liver biopsy if peak ALT level has not fallen by > 50% at 30–60 days after onset in cases of hepatocellular DILI or if peak Alk P has not fallen by > 50% at 180 days in cases of cholestatic DILI despite stopping the suspected offending agent (conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence). We suggest performing a liver biopsy in cases of DILI where continued use or re-exposure to the implicated agent is contemplated (conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence). We suggest considering liver biopsy if liver biochemistry abnormalities persist beyond 180 days, especially if associated with symptoms or signs, to evaluate for the presence of chronic liver diseases (CLDs) and chronic DILI (conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence).

Rechallenge after suspected hepatotoxicity — In general, readministration of a suspected hepatotoxic drug in a patient with ongoing or previous DILI is best avoided, and we strongly recommend against re-exposure to a drug thought likely to have caused hepatotoxicity, especially if the initial liver injury was associated with significant aminotransferase elevation (e.g., > 5xULN, Hy's law, or jaundice); an exception to this recommendation is in cases of life-threatening situations, where there is no suitable alternative (strong recommendation, low quality of evidence).

### ACG clinical guideline: diagnosis and management of idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury [^111tbAtp]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Liver biopsy in suspected DILI — In general, persistence of biochemical abnormalities lowers the threshold for liver biopsy, whereas most DILI cases show a dramatic decline in liver biochemistries after the presumed causative agent is stopped. Some experts consider a less than 50% decline in the peak ALT value 30 days after stopping the suspected agent as reducing the likelihood of a DILI diagnosis, while others place the cut-off time for significant fall in ALT at 60 days. For cholestatic injury, the lack of a significant drop in AP or bilirubin (> 50% drop in peak ULN or drop to < twice ULN) at 180 days is considered significant, and considering a biopsy at 60 days for unresolved acute hepatocellular and 180 days for cholestatic DILI is reasonable. Conversely, if liver biochemistries are trending down, albeit slowly, then delaying liver biopsy is justified. A biopsy is recommended when AIH remains on the differential and certainly if immunosuppressive drugs are continued; if chronic injury including a vanishing bile duct syndrome is suspected, a liver biopsy is indicated for diagnostic and prognostic purposes; and occasionally a liver biopsy may be necessary when continued use or contemplated rechallenge with a suspected medication is clinically necessary. Biopsy may also be warranted in those who have received a previous liver transplant to exclude competing pathologies such as rejection.

Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) — strength and quality definitions: Factors influencing the strength of the recommendation include the quality of the evidence, presumed patient-important outcomes, and cost. Strong recommendations are those where the benefits clearly outweigh the negatives and the result of no action. Conditional recommendations are made when some uncertainty remains about the balance of benefits/potential harm, for example, there may be variability in preferences and values, uncertainty about the study outcomes or quality of evidence, and higher cost or resource consumption. Quality of evidence categories are defined as follows — High: Further research is unlikely to change confidence in the estimate of the clinical effect. Moderate: Further research may change confidence in the estimate of the clinical effect. Low: Further research is likely to have an important impact on the confidence in clinical effect and would likely change the estimate. Very low: There is very little confidence in effect estimate, and the true clinical effect is likely to be substantially different.

Key concepts for HDS-hepatotoxicity — HDS account for an increasing proportion of DILI events in the United States, with body building and weight loss supplements being the most commonly implicated. The current regulation for HDS differs substantially from conventional prescription medications, and most importantly, there is no requirement for premarketing safety analyses of HDS. Patients and providers must be aware that regulation is not rigorous enough to assure complete safety of marketed products, and patients should be made aware of the potential for HDS to cause liver injury. Current causality assessment approaches are not well suited for HDS-hepatotoxicity; however, expert opinion is probably the best suited because all information is taken into consideration in assessing a likelihood of injury. Voluntary reporting of suspected HDS-hepatotoxicity cases through the FDA MEDWATCH system is essential.

Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) terminology and definitions — Table 3 defines intrinsic DILI as hepatotoxicity with potential to affect all individuals and idiosyncratic DILI as affecting only rare susceptible individuals; chronic DILI is failure of return of liver enzymes or bilirubin to baseline 6–9 mo after DILI onset. Latency is time from medication or herbal and dietary supplement (HDS) start to DILI onset, washout/resolution/dechallenge is time from onset to return of enzymes and/or bilirubin to baseline, and rechallenge is readministration of the agent after a prior DILI. Hy's law notes 8–10% mortality or need for LT when DILI presents with serum ALT or AST > 3×ULN and total bilirubin ≥ 2×ULN without initial cholestasis and no alternate explanation. Temple's corollary identifies an imbalance of ALT > 3×ULN between active and control arms in randomized trials and is used to assess hepatotoxic potential, although its specificity for predicting DILI liability is limited. The R-value is ALT/ULN ÷ Alk P/ULN and classifies patterns as hepatocellular (R > 5), mixed (R = 2–5), or cholestatic (R < 2). RUCAM is a diagnostic algorithm using clinical data, pre-existing hepatotoxicity literature, and rechallenge.

Key points

Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) can present with any recognised pattern of liver enzyme derangement.
Diagnosis is complex, with no unifying criteria and a relatively high index of suspicion is necessary.
Coexistent liver disease is an apparent risk factor for DILI.
Standard assessment includes liver ultrasonography and screening for viral and autoimmune hepatitides.
Histology may be useful in prognostication, particularly for those with slow to resolve disease or where there is diagnostic ambiguity.
The mainstay of treatment is withdrawal of the offending agent.
Clinicians may refer to LiverTox as a guide to recorded hepatotoxicity of specific agents.

DILI remains a challenging presentation with specific diagnostic and treatment complexities. Notwithstanding this, there remain a number of outstanding aspects of disease pathogenesis and predisposing factors that necessitate further exploration. There also exists, a clear need for novel biomarkers and predictors of outcome, beyond existing genetic determinants. The advent of novel treatment modalities, particularly oncological immune modulators pose another challenging paradigm, and clinicians should be aware of their potential for hepatotoxicity.

One particularly useful resource which clinicians should be aware of is LiverTox. LiverTox provides contemporaneous, unbiased, and accessible reports on the diagnosis, cause, frequency, clinical patterns and management of liver injury attributable to prescription, non-prescription medications and selected HDS products.

Overall, however, given the inherent complexity of DILI, we would encourage clinicians to refer to the original guideline for points of reference as a definitive overview on the subject matter.

### A community based study of adverse effects of NSAIDS… [^1139mHZV]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

Performer: Albany College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences Principal Investigator: Amy Barton Pai, PharmD Project Duration: 9/30/15–9/29/17 Regulatory Science Challenge. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as ibuprofen and naproxen, are widely available over the counter in pharmacies, wholesale stores, gas stations, and convenience stores for the treatment of fever and pain. In addition, more than 111 million people in the U. S., including many older Americans, take prescription NSAIDs each year. In certain high-risk patients, NSAIDs can significantly disrupt blood flow to the kidneys and precipitate community-acquired acute kidney injury. CA-AKI can lead to hospitalization, new-onset chronic kidney disease, and more rapid progression of existing chronic kidney disease. Many patients are unaware of NSAID-associated risks and the importance of appropriate use to prevent NSAID-induced CA-AKI.

Current patient education materials, including the medication guide, may focus too narrowly on bleeding risks associated with NSAID use and thereby fail to describe the potential for CA-AKI. Project Description Albany College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences implemented a research project to assess NSAID use and the potential for reducing preventable harm from both prescription and over-the-counter use. The project evaluated adverse renal risks among a large population of patients in primary care settings. An informed community-based pilot program was developed to educate providers, patients, and pharmacists and determine if NSAID risk awareness could be improved. Project Goals
- Evaluate a nationwide cohort of patients in the DARTNet Practice Performance Quality Improvement Registry in collaboration with American Academy of Family Physicians National Research Network to determine NSAID prescribing patterns and associated effects on kidney function.
- Develop and implement an innovative community-based NSAID education program to target providers, patients, and pharmacists.
- Evaluate effects of the education program on provider NSAID prescribing patterns and electronic medical record documentation, patient awareness, and pharmacist counseling efforts. Project Results The final report from the researchers to the FDA included the following results:

- Patients exposed to NSAIDS were older, having more co-morbidities and kidney impairment than the general population. Primary care providers commonly prescribed NSAIDS to patients at high risk for NSAID-related kidney injury.
- A majority of patients preferred educational materials in print form. Patients who viewed educational materials in print form achieved higher scores related to NSAID and kidney risk knowledge than those who viewed a video.
- More than half of patients exposed to education materials regarding NSAID-related kidney risks reported they would avoid future NSAID use. Publications: Jang SM, Jiang R, Grabe D, Pai AB.

Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) remains a challenge in clinical practice and is still a diagnosis of exclusion. Although it has a low incidence amongst the general population, DILI accounts for most cases of acute liver failure with a fatality rate of up to 50%. While multiple mechanisms of DILI have been postulated, there is no clear causal relationship between drugs, risk factors and mechanisms of DILI. Current best practice relies on a combination of high clinical suspicion, thorough clinical history of risk factors and timeline, and extensive hepatological investigations as supported by the international Roussel Uclaf Causality Assessment Method criteria, the latter considered a key diagnostic algorithm for DILI. This review focuses on DILI classification, risk factors, clinical evaluation, future biomarkers and management, with the aim of facilitating physicians to correctly identify DILI early in presentation.

Another novel causative potentiator of DILI is those related to the classes of novel immunomodulatory therapeutic classes. These molecules are being increasingly used to treat malignancy through restitution of strong humoral, antitumour immune response, thereby improving patient survival. The reduction in tumour tolerance induced by immune checkpoint inhibitors can lead to inflammatory side effects, and an increase in immune related adverse events, including hepatotoxicity. Risk factors include the type of check point inhibitor, higher dose, autoimmune predisposition, pre-existing liver disease and the use of combination agents. Hepatotoxicity is heterogeneous ranging from mild transaminase derangement to pronounced acute hepatitis and fulminant liver failure. Assessment of severity can be determined using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events scale and persistent grade 2–4 hepatotoxicity, then immunosuppression should be considered, along with cessation of the causative agent. The American Gastoenterological Association (AGA) has produced a practice update relating to this including outline of treatment strategies including corticosteroids and steroid-sparing agents.

The Council for International Organisations of Medical Sciences scale can be used to assess DILI causality and consists of seven domains. The score categorises cases as highly probable (> 8), probable (6–8), possible (3–5), unlikely (1–2) or excluded (< 0) and is useful in initially evaluating likelihood of suspected DILI.

The principle management of suspected DILI is discontinuation of the likely causative agent. In the majority of DILI, spontaneous recovery occurs, without any need for treatment or specific supportive measures. This aspect of spontaneous recovery following discontinuation of an offending substance forms an important criterion in the causality assessment of DILI. There is no strong evidence for use of N-acetyl cysteine) except in paracetamol and ALF. Of note, there is no role for corticosteroids beyond cases of presumed autoimmune hepatitis and immune-related adverse reactions or for the use of ursodeoxycholic acid in cholestatic DILI.

### NSAID prescribing precautions… [^112sSccL]. AAFP (2009). Low credibility.

The renal system relies on the vasodilatory effects of prostaglandins produced primarily by COX-2. This dependence is more marked in persons with renal disease, congestive heart failure, or cirrhosis. Because COX-2 is important for renal prostaglandin production, all NSAIDs can cause volume-dependent renal failure, as well as renal failure from interstitial nephritis and nephritic syndrome. It is estimated that 2 percent of persons taking NSAIDs will stop taking them after developing renal complications. 6 Some medications, such as beta blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, may increase NSAID-related renal complications. 2, 5 When possible, NSAIDs should be avoided in persons with preexisting renal disease, congestive heart failure, or cirrhosis to prevent acute renal failure. 6, 23. Care should be used when prescribing NSAIDs in persons with an increased risk of renal complications.

Some physician groups have proposed monitoring of renal function after initiation of NSAIDs in persons at risk of renal failure, including obtaining a baseline serum creatinine level when starting therapy. Also, some recommend that high-risk persons and persons taking other medications that might decrease renal function, such as ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, be monitored as often as once weekly for three weeks after initiation of therapy. 6 However, it is unclear whether such monitoring improves morbidity or mortality. HEMATOLOGIC Because NSAIDs have antiplatelet effects, they should be avoided in persons with preexisting platelet defects or thrombocytopenia. The antiplatelet effects of NSAIDs should be considered in the perioperative setting. For high-risk persons who have had a recent myocardial infarction or recent placement of a cardiac stent, aspirin should be continued before and after surgery.

For other persons at increased risk of cardiovascular events, the continuation of aspirin should be considered and, if possible, should be used in the perioperative setting. If aspirin is to be withheld preoperatively, it should be stopped seven to 10 days before surgery. Other NSAIDs should be withheld preop-eratively for five elimination half-lives of the medication. For example, ibuprofen should be stopped for the two days before surgery, naproxen for two to three days, and piroxicam for 10 days. 24, 25 Aspirin is associated with a slightly increased rate of hemorrhagic stroke and with a small increase in overall mortality. The survival benefits in persons at high risk of cardiovascular or neurovascular events outweigh the risks. Aspirin should be avoided in persons for whom the benefits do not outweigh the risks, such as persons at low risk of cardiovascular disease.

26 When NSAIDs are combined with anticoagulants there is a significantly increased risk of GI bleeding because of interactions, which can increase the International Normalized Ratio by up to 15 percent. This is in addition to the direct antiplatelet effects of NSAIDs. When it is necessary to start NSAID therapy in persons taking anticoagulants, an increase in INR should be anticipated. There should be appropriate INR monitoring and warfarin dosage adjustments, and GI prophylaxis should be initiated. 2 Similarly, in high-risk persons requiring aspirin, GI prophylaxis should be initiated to offset the increased risk of bleeding complications. CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM Although rare, most central nervous system effects are more common in older persons. Tinnitus is reversible and may be a sign of high medication blood levels. Psychosis and cognitive changes are more common in older persons and are most often associated with indomethacin use.

### Drug-induced liver injury: recent advances in diagnosis and risk assessment [^112XQmKC]. Gut (2017). Low credibility.

This leaves the DILI community with the task of validating new biomarkers and in vitro tools for causality assessment which classify the type of injury and the risk associated with the observed biomarker pattern. How should a transient but rapidly reversible elevation of ALT to > 20-fold ULN be interpreted? Biomarkers that inform us whether this rise in ALT was accompanied by immune activation would help us to classify the incident as an idiosyncratic reaction. Are all cases of DILI that fulfil the Hy's Law criteria in the same risk category or can new biomarkers help to define subcategories? Systematic measurement of new predictive biomarkers should be performed in patients in whom liver injury can be attributed to a specific causative drug by use of the RUCAM score. The choice of biomarkers is a major challenge that is being taken up by numerous initiatives such as the IMI Consortia, DILIN, Pro-Euro DILI and dedicated DILI groups within the International Consortium for Innovation and Quality in Pharmaceutical Development (IQ DILI) and the Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS). Constructive dialogue and close collaboration of these networks with regulatory and academic DILI experts is but one example of the steps required to advance scientific and regulatory guidance for liver safety assessment and management.

### ACG clinical guideline: diagnosis and management of idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury [^114VHhpL]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Genetic and nongenetic risk factors for DILI — Understanding of genetic risk factors is limited and causative agents vary with age; age may confer susceptibility in a drug-specific fashion, with central nervous system agents and antimicrobials more common in children, and infants and children susceptible to valproate and at increased risk of Reye syndrome from aspirin; although PTU may cause DILI in all age groups, children are more susceptible to severe and fatal hepatotoxicity due to PTU. With increasing age, risk of liver injury rises with medications such as isoniazid, amoxicillin-clavulanate, and nitrofurantoin. There is no evidence to suggest that women are at higher risk of all-cause DILI, but they seem to be at higher risk of liver injury from minocycline, methyldopa, diclofenac, and nitrofurantoin. DILI is a rare cause of acute liver injury in pregnant women; there is no evidence to suggest that pregnancy by itself increases the susceptibility to DILI caused by any agents other than tetracycline, common causes in pregnancy include methyldopa, hydralazine, antimicrobials including antiretroviral agents, and PTU, and most cases resolve upon stopping the agent although liver transplantation and maternal death have rarely been reported. Diabetes mellitus shows no evidence of increased risk for all-cause DILI in humans, though injury due to methotrexate and anti-TB medications may be increased in individuals with diabetes, and in DILIN, underlying diabetes was independently associated with death or liver transplantation (hazard ratio 2.3, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.5–3.5). Although alcohol consumption is included in RUCAM, there is no evidence to suggest that chronic alcohol consumption is a risk factor for all-cause DILI; however, heavy alcohol consumption is a risk factor for DILI with APAP, methotrexate, and isoniazid, and package labeling recommends avoiding duloxetine with substantial alcohol consumption.

### Diagnosis, management and prevention of drug-induced liver injury [^115PXCeJ]. Gut (2009). Low credibility.

Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is increasingly being recognised as a significant cause of both acute and chronic liver disease. The most commonly implicated agents are paracetamol, antimicrobials, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, statins, isoniazid and herbal remedies. Drug-induced hepatotoxicity is generally idiosyncratic in nature. The pathogenesis of DILI remains enigmatic, but involves exposure to the toxic agent, mitochondrial injury, failure of adaptation, and innate and adaptive immune responses. Diagnosis of drug-induced liver diseases can be difficult, but the key to causality is to diligently exclude other causes of liver injury, and to identify a characteristic clinical drug-related signature. Management of drug-induced liver injury is symptomatic, with early referral to a liver transplant unit at the first hint of liver failure, especially in those with non-paracetamol-induced liver injury. Prevention of drug hepatotoxicity includes increased vigilance during pre-clinical drug development and clinical trials, alanine aminotransferase monitoring with certain drugs, better marketing strategies, and the future identification of both diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers.

Idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury (DILI) — presentation and immediate management are characterized as follows: Most adults and children present with a drug latency of 2–24 weeks, although some drugs have an ultrashort (< 7 days) latency, and in prospective registries nearly 50% have acute hepatocellular injury with the remainder mixed or cholestatic. Once idiosyncratic DILI is suspected, the suspect agent(s) should be immediately discontinued, and hospitalized patients with severe acute liver injury need to be carefully monitored for disease progression; those with ALF should be urgently referred to a liver transplant center because of their low likelihood (~25% chance) of spontaneous recovery.

### The art and science of diagnosing and managing drug-induced liver injury in 2015 and beyond [^114VbB36]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) remains a leading reason why new compounds are dropped from further study or are the subject of product warnings and regulatory actions. Hy's Law of drug-induced hepatocellular jaundice causing a case-fatality rate or need for transplant of 10% or higher has been validated in several large national registries, including the ongoing, prospective U.S. Drug-Induced Liver Injury Network. It serves as the basis for stopping rules in clinical trials and in clinical practice. Because DILI can mimic all known causes of acute and chronic liver disease, establishing causality can be difficult. Histopathologic findings are often nonspecific and rarely, if ever, considered pathognomonic. A daily drug dose > 50–100 mg is more likely to be hepatotoxic than does < 10 mg, especially if the compound is highly lipophilic or undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism. The quest for a predictive biomarker to replace alanine aminotransferase is ongoing. Markers of necrosis and apoptosis such as microRNA-122 and keratin 18 may prove useful in identifying patients at risk for severe injury when they initially present with a suspected acetaminophen overdose. Although a number of drugs causing idiosyncratic DILI have HLA associations that may allow for pre-prescription testing to prevent hepatotoxicity, the cost and relatively low frequency of injury among affected patients limit the current usefulness of such genome-wide association studies. Alanine aminotransferase monitoring is often recommended but has rarely been shown to be an effective method to prevent serious DILI. Guidelines on the diagnosis and management of DILI have recently been published, although specific therapies remain limited. The LiverTox Web site has been introduced as an interactive online virtual textbook that makes the latest information on more than 650 agents available to clinicians, regulators, and drug developers alike.

Management

Prompt discontinuation of the implicated drug remains the most important step to managing DILI. Cessation of the causative agent often leads to spontaneous recovery in days to weeks and does not require any further therapeutic interventions. Yet, the trajectory of clinical and biochemical resolution is not always predictable. Protraction of or deterioration in hepatic function despite cessation of the culprit drug can generate significant clinical uncertainty, leading to alternative causes being missed and appropriate therapy not being administered. Moreover, biochemical resolution of liver tests may not always connote clinical improvement, with decreasing ALT observed in patients with reducing hepatic reserve from liver necrosis. Active surveillance with frequent blood tests is critical for this patient cohort. Spontaneous recovery from paracetamol-induced ALF is observed in 65% of cases. In contrast, recovery from idiosyncratic drug-induced ALF is uncommon, with 27.1% of patients surviving longer than 3 weeks. Consequently, early involvement of a hepatologist and transfer to a gastroenterology ward are paramount to patient survival. With LT improving overall survival to 66%, any signs of ALF including coagulopathy [international normalized ratio (INR) > 1.5], ascites and encephalopathy should prompt transfer to intensive care and urgent referral to a tertiary liver unit.

Two treatment approaches have been endorsed to manage patients who develop drug-induced ALF. One is through rapid depuration of the toxic drug to limit its absorption and dose-dependent hepatotoxic effects. Activated charcoal is widely used to treat drug overdoses such as paracetamol, phenobarbital and carbamazepine. – As its therapeutic benefit is restricted to within 3–4 h of acute ingestion of the toxin, the efficacy of depuration therapy is highly dependent on prompt admission of patients for assessment, recognition of potential DILI by physicians and healthcare resource availability. Consequently, depuration therapy is often limited to drugs that cause an intrinsic pattern of DILI and has shown to be of little benefit in idiosyncratic DILI and HILI. Previous uses of whole bowel irrigation and gastric lavage have largely been superseded by activated charcoal depuration but can sometimes be used in cases of acute poisoning with iron, lithium, sustained release tablets and body packing.

### Guideline review: EASL clinical practice guidelines: drug-induced liver injury (DILI) [^1143mwnJ]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Overview/commentary

Guidelines have been produced by the European Association for the Study of the Liver for the investigation and management of drug-induced liver injury (DILI). DILI is epitomised by a myriad of presentations and idiosyncrasies, posing significant diagnostic challenge to generalists and hepatologists.

DILI is traditionally classified as intrinsic (or direct) versus idiosyncratic. Characteristically, intrinsic DILI is usually a predictable, dose-related phenomenon, occurring in a large subset of exposed individuals, with relatively short time to onset. Idiosyncratic DILI is not usually dose-related; however, a dose threshold is generally required, with variable latency of onset; from days to weeks.

In addition to specific drug-related properties, there are important host predisposing factors including advancing age, sex, alcohol intake and underlying liver disease. Female sex appears to confer risk for DILI and have a higher risk of progression to acute liver failure. There are additional genetic drivers for DILI which vary widely and are covered extensively in the original guidelines.

A general approach to a suspected case of DILI is presented in figure 1. This includes taking a comprehensive medical and drug history, with clear timing around drug usage. Potential agents may include both prescribed and non-prescribed compounds, herbal and dietary supplements (HDS), over-the-counter products and illicit substances.

### Guideline review: EASL clinical practice guidelines: drug-induced liver injury (DILI) [^114vfqwf]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Patients with DILI should undergo testing for hepatotropic viruses including hepatitis (A–E), particularly in those with acute hepatocellular injury. For completeness an autoantibody screen (antinuclear antibody, anti-smooth muscle antibody (ASMA)), M2-anti-mitochondrial antibody (AMA), liver microsomal antibody, immunoglobulins) should be undertaken. DILI assessment should also include coagulation profiles, as elevated prothrombin time ratio values may suggest impending acute liver failure (ALF) and prompt referral to a liver transplant unit should be considered.

Abdominal ultrasound should be undertaken in all patients suspected of DILI to exclude any biliary, parenchymal or vasculopathy, additional imaging is dependent on the clinical context.

Liver biopsy may be reasonable to consider in DILI, as histology may provide information pertaining to severity of liver injury and provide mechanistic insights by identifying specific patterns of injury. Liver biopsy is also warranted in those patients suspected of DILI when serology raises the possibility of autoimmune hepatitis. Liver biopsy may also be considered in patients whereby suspected DILI progresses, or fails to resolve on withdrawal of the causal agent, since histology may provide prognostic information assisting clinical decision particularly regarding immunosuppression. There are characteristic histological patterns associated with individual check-point inhibitors including presence of ring granulomas and endotheliitis which may aid decision making around immunosuppression. In select cases of DILI, human leucocyte antigen genotyping can be used, whereby genetic determination may aid diagnosis and management, particularly those with features compatible with autoimmune hepatitis.

Given the non-specific nature of traditionally employed liver enzyme measurements there is increasing interest in determining novel serum biomarkers. These markers include glutamate dehydrogenase, keratin 18, glutathione S-transferase, sorbitol dehydrogenase, bile acids, cytochrome P450 and osteopontin. These markers may help to improve the specificity of DILI diagnosis, and aid prognostication. Presently, however, none are routinely employed, but represent exciting future avenues of research.

Rechallenging patients who had initial drug-related liver injury can lead to rapid, progressive liver insult often worse than previous with fulminant hepatic failure. A positive rechallenge is defined as an ALT > 3 ULN and is the strongest proof of drug causality. Some essential, irreplaceable medications may be used to rechallenge patients including; antituberculous and chemotherapy agents, however, this should only be considered with meticulous monitoring arrangements under specialist supervision.

### Drug-induced liver injury: a comprehensive review [^11634e9F]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

DILI is an uncommon but potentially fatal adverse reaction to a drug with significant heterogeneity in both latency and pattern of liver injury. Clinical suspicion with history of previous DILI together with liver enzyme derangement remains the hallmark for the diagnosis of DILI. Judicious assessment with both an extensive liver panel and imaging as well as consideration for a liver biopsy is necessary to exclude alternative diagnosis of liver pathology. Spontaneous recovery is seen in most patients with DILI; nonetheless, close clinical and biochemical monitoring is vital, with clinical presentations of ALF prompting urgent referral to intensive therapy unit and referral to tertiary liver units for consideration of LT. Both genetic testing and biomarkers have been newly incorporated into clinical practice to aid early diagnosis of drug toxicity as well as to risk stratify patients who will need immunosuppressive therapy following LT. Extrapolating genetic testing to risk stratify patients with chronic diseases needing long-term medical therapy may be a future strategy to reduce the incidence of DILI.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^112eit57]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Drug and supplement-induced liver injury — medications and supplements are emphasized as common sources: "Prescribed and over-the-counter medications, as well as non-prescribed complementary alternative medicines or dietary supplements, represent a common source for acute and chronic liver injury". Workup demands thorough review, since "Identification of an offending agent is challenging and requires a comprehensive query of the patient, his or her family, and careful review of available medical and pharmacy records and laboratory data (22)". Many drugs can raise enzymes: "Many medications are associated with at least a small risk of elevation of ALT/AST/alkaline phosphatase or bilirubin with or without hepatotoxicity", and for statins "there is an extensive literature on the safety in those with chronic liver disease with only rare cases of hepatotoxicity reported (60,61)". In suspected acetaminophen exposure, clarify use when enzymes are markedly elevated: "In those with high ALT levels (> 1,000IU/l) an accurate history of acetaminophen use either as a single medicine or in combination with analgesic-narcotic combinations is essential". Management often involves withdrawal and monitoring: "Attributing liver injury to a specific agent frequently requires empiric trials of drug discontinuation to observe full recovery of liver chemistries", with substitution or surveillance as needed. Clinicians should ask about supplements — "Specific query for non-prescribed supplements is essential to discovery of associated liver injury" — and be aware that "Common herbal supplements associated with hepatotoxicity include chaparral, ephedra, ji bu huan, germander, green tea extract, and shark cartilage (8,62)". A practical reference is provided: "A helpful resource that is available to clinicians trying to ascertain whether a drug or supplement may be hepatotoxic is the website livertox.nih.gov".

### Nomenclature, diagnosis and management of drug-induced autoimmune-like hepatitis (DI-ALH): an expert opinion meeting report [^111Na9LN]. Journal of Hepatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Management and treatment of DI-ALH

Information is scarce on the management of DI-ALH and comes mainly from retrospective studies. Treatment decisions are often based on experience gained from case reports or expert opinion. The most important initial step in terms of management of any suspected case of DILI is to discontinue the implicated agent. Delays in withdrawal of the suspected drug may impact both the severity of injury and responsiveness to therapy. Published DI-ALH cases reported high rates of spontaneous recovery after discontinuation. Resolution may not appear immediately and ongoing or even worsening liver injury can occur despite the withdrawal of the implicated drug. The type of liver injury should be assessed because steroid therapy may be necessary in the case of persistent hepatocellular or mixed type liver injury.

A management algorithm is illustrated in Fig. 3. EASL guidelines suggest that a multidisciplinary approach that considers the patient's clinical and histological features should be followed when deciding on whether to initiate steroid treatment. Patients with suspected DI-ALH should undergo detailed evaluation including a liver biopsy in most cases. Concerning histology, the validation cohort of the new simplified criteria did not include patients with DI-ALH. It is not clear if the results of histology, lack of improvement of liver tests after stopping the implicated drug or both should be used as the indication for corticosteroids in patients with DI-ALH. An international collaborative study of all DILI cases retrieved from two prospective DILI registries using propensity score-matching analysis found that the benefit from steroid therapy (increase in the normalisation rate of liver biochemistry) was more evident in patients with severe DILI (nR-based Hy's law) without disease resolution within 30 days of stopping the implicated drug.

Idiosyncratic (unpredictable) drug-induced liver injury is one of the most challenging liver disorders faced by hepatologists, because of the myriad of drugs used in clinical practice, available herbs and dietary supplements with hepatotoxic potential, the ability of the condition to present with a variety of clinical and pathological phenotypes and the current absence of specific biomarkers. This makes the diagnosis of drug-induced liver injury an uncertain process, requiring a high degree of awareness of the condition and the careful exclusion of alternative aetiologies of liver disease. Idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity can be severe, leading to a particularly serious variety of acute liver failure for which no effective therapy has yet been developed. These Clinical Practice Guidelines summarize the available evidence on risk factors, diagnosis, management and risk minimization strategies for drug-induced liver jury.

### Drug-induced liver injury: a comprehensive review [^115Wc96H]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Immune-checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-hepatitis is rare, with incidence increasing on the use of combination therapy with other ICI or chemotherapy drugs. ICIs such as programmed cell death protein 1 antagonists (nivolumab and pembrolizumab) and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 antagonists (ipilimumab) adversely induce hepatitis as a sequela to over-activating the immune system in response to the tumour. Identification of deranged liver tests with thorough evaluation of aetiologies including cancer progression, alcohol misuse and opportunistic viral infections is warranted. The Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events can be used to assess the severity of ICI-hepatitis. Severity is graded by the level of ALT and AST: Grade 1 (> ULN to 3 times ULN), Grade 2 (> 3–5 times ULN), Grade 3 (> 5–20 times ULN) and Grade 4 (> 20 times ULN). Consensus from the Innovation and Quality DILI Immunotherapy Working Group has not recommended the use of RUCAM to diagnosis immunotherapy-induced DILI. This may be due to difficulty achieving scores to categorise patients as having 'probable' or 'highly probable' DILI without previous exposure or re-exposure to the immunotherapy, which is not safe to do in patients with cancer. Nevertheless, we recommend clinicians to actively exclude alternative causes of DILI, such as antibiotic use in immunosuppressed oncological patients following opportunistic infections, especially when considering the prognostic implications in discontinuing immunotherapy. The use of the updated RUCAM score may therefore be of benefit to clinicians as a tool to exclude alternative causes of DILI. The American Gastroenterological Associationprovides a useful guideline in managing ICI-induced hepatitis. For patients with Grade 1 ICI-hepatitis, defined by AST/ALT elevated ≤ 3 times ULN and bilirubin elevated ≤ 1.5 times ULN, continuing immunotherapy whilst close monitoring of symptoms with weekly or biweekly blood tests may be sufficient. Grade 2 ICI-hepatitis, defined by rises in AST/ALT of up to 3–5 times ULN and bilirubin of up to 1.5–3 times ULN, should prompt clinicians to consider liver biopsy, hold the culprit ICI and initiate 0.5–1 mg/kg/day oral prednisolone. Resumption of ICI should be considered in patients showing improvement in LTs to ≤ Grade 1 hepatitis following a slow taper of corticosteroid over a month. Permanent discontinuation of ICI with admission to hospital for liver biopsy and 1–2 mg/kg/day IV methylprednisolone therapy is recommended in patients with Grade 3 or 4 ICI-hepatitis (defined by an AST/ALT > 5 times ULN and bilirubin > 3 times ULN). Slow tapering of steroids over 1 month following Grade 3–4 hepatitis is recommended if improvement in LTs is seen. Nevertheless, it is important to highlight that the use of corticosteroids in ICI-hepatitis is based on longitudinal studies and there are no randomised controlled trials that have validated its effect. Treatment with immunomodulators including azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil or tacrolimus is recommended in patients where a drop in transaminases by ⩾50% within 3–5 days. The use of anti-thymocyte globulin is reserved for patients with fulminant hepatitis due to its potential pro-oncogenic properties.

Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) and ACLF — key concepts highlight causes, prevention, timing, and outcomes. Both prescribed and nonprescribed medications can cause DILI, with antimicrobials most common among prescribed agents, and self-medication with complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is common. Actual prevalence of ACLF related to DILI is unknown because DILI is often underreported, and most patients have an uneventful recovery. The prevalence of hepatotoxicity due to CAM in the United States is approximately 7%. Onset of ACLF occurs on average 1 month after the offending drug and can be delayed up to 3 months. Mortality in DILI-related ACLF is > 50%, with ACLF grade the only significant predictor. Prevention centers on patient education to limit pharmacological agents and avoid CAM, and patients with underlying liver disease should be monitored when prescribed new hepatotoxic medications.

Qualification efforts have been hindered by lack of properly stored and consented biospecimens that are linked to clinical data relevant to a specific context of use. Recommendations are made for biospecimen collection procedures, with the focus on clinical trials, and for specific emerging biomarkers to focus qualification efforts.

### When is suspected drug-induced liver injury (DILI) not DILI? An analysis of unlikely cases from the drug-induced liver injury network [^114VWZsb]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Diagnosis of drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is difficult. We reviewed cases in the DILI Network prospective study that were adjudicated to have liver injury due to other causes to discover pearls for improved diagnostic accuracy.

Methods

Cases were adjudicated by expert opinion and scored from 1 (definite DILI) to 5 (unlikely DILI). Confirmed cases (1–3) were compared with unlikely cases (5).

Results

One hundred thirty-four of the 1,916 cases (7%) were unlikely DILI. Alternative diagnoses were autoimmune hepatitis (20%), hepatitis C (20%), bile duct pathology (13%), and hepatitis E (8%).

Discussion

Thorough evaluation, including follow-up, is essential to minimize incorrect diagnosis of idiosyncratic DILI.

Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is an adverse reaction to drugs or other xenobiotics that occurs either as a predictable event when an individual is exposed to toxic doses of some compounds or as an unpredictable event with many drugs in common use. Drugs can be harmful to the liver in susceptible individuals owing to genetic and environmental risk factors. These risk factors modify hepatic metabolism and excretion of the DILI-causative agent leading to cellular stress, cell death, activation of an adaptive immune response and a failure to adapt, with progression to overt liver injury. Idiosyncratic DILI is a relative rare hepatic disorder but can be severe and, in some cases, fatal, presenting with a variety of phenotypes, which mimic other hepatic diseases. The diagnosis of DILI relies on the exclusion of other aetiologies of liver disease as specific biomarkers are still lacking. Clinical scales such as CIOMS/RUCAM can support the diagnostic process but need refinement. A number of clinical variables, validated in prospective cohorts, can be used to predict a more severe DILI outcome. Although no pharmacological therapy has been adequately tested in randomized clinical trials, corticosteroids can be useful, particularly in the emergent form of DILI related to immune-checkpoint inhibitors in patients with cancer.
