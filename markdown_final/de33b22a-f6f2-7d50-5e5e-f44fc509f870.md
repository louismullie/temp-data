## Question

367. Determine the geometric figure represented by the system of equations

{x² + y² + z² − 4x = 0; y = 1}

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking to determine the geometric figure represented by the system of equations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the first equation and complete the square to identify the 3D surface. Then, I should substitute the constraint y = 1 into that equation to see how it restricts the surface. Next, I will interpret the resulting equation in 3D space and verify the center and radius. Finally, I will state the geometric figure clearly and double-check that my conclusion matches the algebra.

> Let me first confirm the 3D surface implied by the first equation. The equation x² + y² + z² − 4x = 0 looks like a sphere, but I should complete the square in x to be sure. Completing the square for the x terms gives (x² − 4x + 4) + y² + z² = 4, which simplifies to (x − 2)² + y² + z² = 4, so this is a sphere centered at (2, 0, 0) with radius 2 [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify the constraint's effect. Substituting y = 1 into the sphere equation yields (x − 2)² + 1² + z² = 4, which simplifies to (x − 2)² + z² = 3. Hold on, I should verify the constants: 4 − 1 = 3, so yes, that's correct [^notfound].

> I will now examine the resulting equation. The equation (x − 2)² + z² = 3 with y fixed at 1 describes a circle in the plane y = 1, centered at (2, 1, 0) with radius √3. Let me think about orientation: because y is constant, the circle lies parallel to the xz-plane, which aligns with standard interpretations of constrained spheres in 3D geometry [^notfound].

> But wait, what if I misstated the center? I initially thought the center might be (2, 0, 0) because that's the sphere's center, but hold on, I should correct that: the constraint y = 1 shifts the effective center of the circle to (2, 1, 0) in the plane y = 1, even though the original sphere is centered at (2, 0, 0). So the final geometric figure is a circle of radius √3 centered at (2, 1, 0) and lying in the plane y = 1 [^notfound].

---

The system represents a **circle** in 3D space, formed by the intersection of a sphere and a plane. The first equation, (x² + y² + z² − 4x = 0), is a sphere centered at ((2, 0, 0)) with radius 2, and the second equation, (y = 1), is a plane parallel to the xz-plane. Substituting (y = 1) into the sphere equation gives ((x − 2)² + z² = 3), which is a circle of radius √3 centered at ((2, 1, 0)) in the plane (y = 1).

---

## Step 1: Analyze the first equation

The first equation is:

x² + y² + z² − 4x = 0

To identify the geometric figure, we **complete the square** for the (x) terms:

x² − 4x + y² + z² = 0

(x² − 4x + 4) + y² + z² = 4

(x − 2)² + y² + z² = 4

This is the standard form of a **sphere** centered at ((2, 0, 0)) with radius 2.

---

## Step 2: Analyze the second equation

The second equation is:

y = 1

This represents a **plane** parallel to the xz-plane, intersecting the y-axis at (y = 1).

---

## Step 3: Find the intersection

Substitute (y = 1) into the sphere equation:

(x − 2)² + 1² + z² = 4

(x − 2)² + z² = 3

This is the equation of a **circle** in the plane (y = 1), centered at ((2, 1, 0)) with radius √3.

---

## Step 4: Visualize the result

The sphere and plane intersect to form a **circle** lying in the plane (y = 1), centered at ((2, 1, 0)) with radius √3.

---

## Final answer

The geometric figure represented by the system is a **circle** in 3D space, lying in the plane (y = 1), centered at ((2, 1, 0)) with radius √3.

Methods

Complexification of ordinary differential equations

The complexified version(z = x + iy) leads to the two-dimensional dynamical system:

The real axis is an invariant subspace, retrieving our real results; yet complexification endows the dynamics with an intriguing capability: as Fig. 4a, b illustrates through the (x, y) phase plane, collapse is avoided in the presence of a minuscule imaginary part. Large elliptical-looking trajectories are traced on the phase plane, eventually returning to the neighborhood of the sole fixed point of (0, 0) — which in the real case one would characterize as semi-stable. The system of Eq. (19) can be tackled in closed form since the ODEyields 1/ z = − t + 1/ z (0). For z = x + iy (z (0) = x 0 + iy 0) we obtain the explicit orbit formulaEliminating time by dividing the two ODEs within Eq. (19) directly yields an ODE for y = y (x) (rather than the parametric forms of Eqs. (20), (21)). From this ODE, one can obtain that the quantityis an invariant of the phase plane dynamics, and thus the latter can be written as x 2 + (y − R) 2 = R 2, where. That is, the trajectory evolves along circles of radius R in the upper (resp. lower) half plane if y 0 > 0 (resp. y 0 < 0.) Approaching the axis with y 0 → 0, the curvature of these circles tends to 0 and their radius to ∞ (retrieving the real dynamics as a special case). Figure 4 through its planar projections illustrates not only the radial projection of the dynamics in the x − y plane, but the x − t and y − t dependencies.

Additional Step 4. Estimation of the local off‐resonance.

The rotation angle in Equation [7] includes the local off‐resonanceand RF phase offset, which cannot be separated from Equation [5]. For simplicity, the chemical shift is ignored and the additional phase errors due to eddy current effects and B 0 drift are assumed to be negligible:

The off‐resonance, however, can be estimated from the locations of the data points with different RF phase increment settingson the vertical ellipse: the precession angleduring each TR depends only on the RF phase incrementand the local off‐resonance, and not on the RF phase offset:

Using a Cartesian parametric equation of the ellipse:and after substitution of x and y from Equation [13] by the real and imaginary components of the signal in Equation [4], the relationship between parameters t andcan be found as:

Methods

Background

The study of dynamical systems has traditionally focused on identifying a set of differential equations that describe the time evolution of the system. While this approach works well for simple systems, it becomes increasingly complex as the number of degrees of freedom grows, necessitating new tools and methods of analysis. In recent years, and with the advent of neural networks, there has been a paradigm shift in modeling dynamical systems. Data-driven modeling is increasingly being used to model and predict the behavior of dynamical systems, without explicitly solving the governing equations, especially for complex systems where the governing differential equations cannot be derived easily. In this section, we provide methods used to implement a data-driven approach in modeling aging dynamics.

In the modeling of aging, when the system has a large number of degrees of freedom, the complexity of dynamics is extremely high. In such cases, the presence of multiple positive Lyapunov exponents — often indicative of chaos, shifts the focus from predicting individual trajectories to studying the evolution of the dynamical system as a whole. The emphasis moves to understanding the manifold on which the system evolves over time, to capture the overall behavior rather than the specifics of single-particle dynamics. In the context of dynamical systems, a manifold is a mathematical space that locally resembles Euclidean space and serves as a geometric framework to capture the global structure of the dynamics.

These manifolds, commonly referred to as Lagrangian Coherent Structures (LCS), can be generalized to time-dependent manifolds that evolve smoothly over time. To formalize this, consider a phase space denoted by, which describes the state space of the system, and a time interval, representing the duration of interest. The dynamics of the system are governed by a time-dependent flow map:where F (t; t 0)(x 0) represents the position of the trajectory starting atat the initial time t 0, after evolving under the flow for a time t − t 0. For simplicity, we may assume t 0 = 0, allowing the notation to reduce to:

An invariant manifold satisfies:where every point onremains on the manifold under the flow of the system. This property makes invariant manifolds fundamental in understanding the geometric structure of dynamical systems, as they often represent boundaries between qualitatively different behaviors or act as organizing centers for trajectories.

Discussion

The dynamics of many physical systems are constrained by their geometry and can be understood as excitations of a relatively small number of structural modes. Here we show that structural eigenmodes derived solely from the brain's geometry provide a more compact, accurate and parsimonious representation of its macroscale activity than alternative connectome-based models. This mode-based view of the brain further shows that both spontaneous and evoked brain activity captured by fMRI are dominated by large-scale eigenmodes with relatively long wavelengths, whose dynamics are derived from a biophysically motivated wave equation. These findings challenge the classical neuroscientific paradigm in which topologically complex patterns of interregional connectivity between discrete, specialized neuronal populations are viewed as a critical anatomical foundation for dynamics. Instead, our results indicate that a physically grounded approach that treats the brain as a continuous, spatially embedded system offers a unifying framework for understanding structural constraints on diverse aspects of macroscopic neuronal function.

The extensive comparisons of geometric eigenmodes with other anatomical (connectome and EDR eigenmodes) and statistical (PCA and Fourier) basis sets show that the superior performance of geometric eigenmodes in capturing macroscale neocortical activity is not trivially driven by generic mathematical properties of basis set expansions. Rather, this result indicates that geometry represents a fundamental anatomical constraint on dynamics. Additionally, the strong performance of the EDR eigenmodes derived from a synthetic network suggests that a homogeneous, distance-dependent connectivity with near-exponential form represents another important anatomical constraint on activity. EDR-like connectivity is mathematically embedded within the Helmholtz equation in equation (1), (Supplementary Information 8), so the role of such connectivity is implicitly captured by the geometric eigenmodes.

As science matures, it becomes more mathematical, progressing from enumeration to the use of equations to the formulation of models. Clinical pharmacology has developed to the stage where models play an increasingly important role in predicting and analyzing drug pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, and even in characterizing disease progression and therapeutic response. Useful models have two characteristics that are in ostensible conflict: (i) they must accurately represent the essential features of the underlying system and (ii) the representation must be sufficiently simplified to enable its salient features to be identified and investigated through further experimentation.

### The use of plots in orthopaedic literature [^95fed5f5]. The Bone & Joint Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Plots are an elegant and effective way to represent data. At their best they encourage the reader and promote comprehension. A graphical representation can give a far more intuitive feel to the pattern of results in the study than a list of numerical data, or the result of a statistical calculation. The temptation to exaggerate differences or relationships between variables by using broken axes, overlaid axes, or inconsistent scaling between plots should be avoided. A plot should be self-explanatory and not complicated. It should make good use of the available space. The axes should be scaled appropriately and labelled with an appropriate dimension. Plots are recognised statistical methods of presenting data and usually require specialised statistical software to create them. The statistical analysis and methods to generate the plots are as important as the methodology of the study itself. The software, including dates and version numbers, as well as statistical tests should be appropriately referenced. Following some of the guidance provided in this article will enhance a manuscript.

### Geometric constraints on human brain function [^4934e90a]. Nature (2023). Excellent credibility.

Wave dynamics bridge geometry and function

Geometric eigenmodes of the cortex are obtained by solving the eigenvalue problem of the LBO, which is also known as the Helmholtz equation (equation (1)). In physically continuous systems, the solutions of the Helmholtz equation correspond to the spatial projections of the solutions of a more general wave equation, such that the resulting eigenmodes inherently represent the vibrational patterns, or standing waves, of the system's dynamics. This equivalence implies that the superior efficacy of geometric eigenmodes in the reconstruction of diverse patterns of brain activity results from a fundamental role of wave dynamics in shaping these patterns, as predicted by NFT. This prediction has been confirmed through models of EEG recordings, but waves across the whole brain have only recently been observed in fMRI signals, and thus far lack a theoretical explanation. Here we use NFT and geometric eigenmodes to show that wave dynamics can provide a unifying account of diverse empirical and physiological phenomena observed at scales accessible with fMRI.

We model neural activity using an isotropic damped NFT wave equation without regeneration(Fig. 4a and NFT wave model in Methods). Under this model, activity propagates between points on the neocortex through their white-matter connectivity with a strength that decays approximately exponentially with distance (Supplementary Fig. 10 and Supplementary Information 1 and 8). To simulate resting-state neural activity we use a white noise input to mimic unstructured stochastic fluctuations(Modelling resting-state dynamics in Methods). We compare the performance of this simple wave model with a biophysically based neural mass model (balanced excitation–inhibition (BEI) model) that has been used extensively to understand resting-state fMRI signals(Fig. 4a and Neural mass model in Methods). The neural mass model is closely aligned with the classical, connectome-centric view of brain function, representing dynamics as the result of interactions between neuronal populations in discrete anatomical regions, coupled according to an empirically measured connectome.

### Limits on the computational expressivity of non-equilibrium biophysical processes [^792ad689]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Storing more classes by increasing input multiplicity

We now generalize the binary classification task and ask how many different classes can be stored as a function of the hyperparameters M and D. Classifying many different classes is crucial in biology. For example, deciphering the glycan code, which specifies one of several hundred different cell states, or recognizing previously encountered antigens during an immune response both require choosing among large numbers of possibilities. How these biochemical systems achieve these complex classification tasks (e.g. through microscopic sensing events like estimating antigen binding affinities) remains an important and open question.

For M = 1, a simple geometric argument suggests that up to 2 D classes could in principle be separated. Each class could be placed in one of the 2 D orthants of the input space, and a classifier with monotonicity along each axis could in principle assign a unique response to each. In Fig. 4 A we attempt to distinguish four classes by placing them in the four quadrants of the (F a, F b) plane, but we find, contrary to this expectation, that no network can separate them all with M = 1.

Input multiplicity allows overcoming reduced degrees of freedom and increases multi-class capacity.

B Schematic illustration of how the learnable parameters W i j (the edge rates on the left) are first multiplied within directed spanning trees into products called directed tree weights, which are then summed together to yield the polynomial functionsappearing in Equation (2). Although each functionis uniquely defined, there exist equality constraints owing to the physics of Markov networks which reduce the effective number of degrees of freedom below the number needed to solve the four-class classification task in A. C By including driving along the dashed arrows in Fig. 1 E (setting M = 2), there are sufficiently many degrees of freedom to solve the four-class classification task.

### Graphical data presentation [^8085a383]. Injury (2008). Low credibility.

Figures and charts are the most influential vehicles for distributing scientific information, for affecting decisions as to the acceptance or rejection of a manuscript, and for attracting the attention of the scientific community to study results. Graphical excellence is mainly defined, first, by the highest possible data density (that is, the amount of information provided per graph area); second, by a low ink-to-data ratio (the avoidance of unnecessary shading, three-dimensionality, gridlines and what is often called 'chartjunk'); and third, by clear and unequivocal labelling of axes. The researcher's essential graphical toolbox should contain histograms, bar charts (always with measures of error), box-and-whiskers plots, scatter plots and forest plots.

Basic stereological measurements — first-order parameters and probes identify that "First-order parameters are volume (three-dimensional [3D]), surface (two-dimensional [2D]), length (one-dimensional [1D]), and number (zero-dimensional [0D])". Measurements "are performed using geometric test probes, such as points (0D), lines (1D), planes (2D), or volumes (3D)". These probes create countable events in the image, and "Raw counts provide ratios… that are multiplied by the reference space volume to obtain absolute measures for the lung or subcompartment".

### THE CASE AGAINST urethral failure is not a critical factor in female urinary incontinence. now what? The integral theory system [^d26f8aef]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2022). Medium credibility.

What is meant by "urethral failure"? If "urethral failure" means the detrimental effect on urethral resistance to flow, Figure 5, by muscle or ligament weakness, then the ITS, "three theory paradigm" and "urethral failure" proposals may (possibly) all be "on the same page", if the "urethral failure" concept accords with ITS for function, and dysfunction.

7.1 Predictive modeling

The Integral Theory Diagnostic System's clinical decision tree, Figure 6, and mathematical modeling, accord with the CASE FOR's criteriafor predictive modeling.

In part or in full, Figure 6 has been used before surgery by ITS followers on a regular basis since 1993. It gives approximate % probabilities for cure by repairing specific ligaments. Ligament damage is confirmed by vaginal examination and "simulated operations", e.g. as in Figures 3 and 4. Figure 6 has been computerized as a software program, the ITDS (Integral Theory Diagnostic System). The % probabilities for cure are estimates based on surgical results. An enormous potential exists for researchers to test every element of Figure 6 predictions against treatment results using more advanced objective testing methods now emerging.

7.2 Mathematical modeling of the nonlinear binary feedback system

Figure 7 graphically represents the summation of all the modes of the bladder, retention, normal, low compliance, instability (UUI, OAB) iterated by the Chaos Theory feedback equation, Xnext = Xc(1‐X), where "c" represents reflex cortical and peripheral suppression of afferent urothelial impulses "X" from urothelial stretch receptors "N", Figure 1; X = fraction of possible nerve impulses emanating from "N" in the micturition circuit of the model; Numeral "1" = maximum possible number of impulses in the circuit. How "c" and "X" were calculated: X was given a mean value of 0.5, being a sufficient number for input to the micturition center. "c" is inversely proportional to the quantum of inhibition. The clinical conditions were fitted into known "c" values from the Chaos Equation, inversely applied: Fowler's Syndrome (retention) has a very low "c", urge incontinence a high "c".

### A standard system phantom for magnetic resonance imaging [^c1ac040e]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

The inner frame of the prototype phantoms was designed to be very rigid and allow the fiducial‐sphere centers to be located within a ± 0.1 mm accuracy. Details of the plate locating mechanism are shown in Supporting Information Figure S1. A hemispherical machined surface on the post mates with a set of inclined plates to precisely locate the plates and eliminate torsional bending. The precision construction of the prototypes comes at an increased cost due to the need for computer‐controlled machining. It was deemed necessary for the prototypes to have such precision to allow the study of scanner geometric distortion.

2.2 Fiducial array

The system phantom contains a 3D fiducial array that can be used to assess geometric distortion, image uniformity and B 1 homogeneity. The fiducial array was modeled on the ADNI phantom, 4 which has successfully been used to correct geometric distortions and image nonuniformity. The fiducial array spheres all have the same fill solutions with the same T 1 and T 2 properties (T 1 = 407 ms ± 6 ms, T 2 = 347 ms ± 6 ms at 20.0°C, 3.0 T), which means they can be used to assess image homogeneity and calculate B 1 variation, both transmit, and receive, fields.

The fiducial array consists of a set of 57 precision‐machined polyvinyl chloride (PVC) 10.0 mm ± 0.1 mm inner‐diameter spheres on a 3D cubic lattice, with a lattice spacing of 40 mm ± 0.1 mm. Figure 2 shows a coronal MRI with a subset of the fiducial spheres along with 10 mm diameter circular regions of interest (ROIs) at their prescribed positions, before automated sphere location. Figure 2 shows standard output from the Python‐based analysis package, after sphere location, plotting image uniformity and geometric distortion along the x, y, z axes, respectively. The fiducial spheres are numbered 1 through 57, starting at plate 1, increasing from right to left, then inferior to superior. For data presentation purposes, the 57 fiducial array elements are divided into seven groups: 27 internal spheres on central 3 × 3 × 3 grid, 5 spheres at each of the six outward faces of the phantom. Each set of fiducials is represented by a different color in the plots in Figure 2.

### Unifying speed limit, thermodynamic uncertainty relation and heisenberg principle via bulk-boundary correspondence [^e12e4fdb]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

The bulk-boundary correspondence provides a guiding principle for tackling strongly correlated and coupled systems. In the present work, we apply the concept of the bulk-boundary correspondence to thermodynamic bounds described by classical and quantum Markov processes. Using the continuous matrix product state, we convert a Markov process to a quantum field, such that jump events in the Markov process are represented by the creation of particles in the quantum field. Introducing the time evolution of the continuous matrix product state, we apply the geometric bound to its time evolution. We find that the geometric bound reduces to the speed limit relation when we represent the bound in terms of the system quantity, whereas the same bound reduces to the thermodynamic uncertainty relation when expressed based on quantities of the quantum field. Our results show that the speed limits and thermodynamic uncertainty relations are two aspects of the same geometric bound.

### Arch vessel injury: geometrical considerations. implications for the mechanism of traumatic myocardial infarction II [^87ec68f5]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Various types of vascular injury have been reported in the medical literature; the isthmic part of the aorta is at particularly high risk of traumatic rupture. Early diagnosis results in better survival, justifying the search for potential risk factors and diagnostic tests. The aim of this research was to investigate the complex mechanism of blunt injury to the vascular wall with particular focus on the branching region of the vessels. Geometric peculiarities were investigated.

Methods

Multi-phase equations have been used. The system of equations with certain boundary conditions was solved numerically by applying the finite-difference method with order of approximation equal to 0.0001.

Results

The degree of curvature (the Dean number) is highly informative about the shear stress on the external surface of the vessel. An important function of the blood flow on the external wall is to destroy rouleaux. The viscosity of phase 2 (f2) exceeds, by many times, the viscosity of phase 1 (f1). The major stress created by blood flow is expressed as the shear stress of f2. The volume fraction of rouleaux depends to a greater degree on the concentration of erythrocytes (expressed as the viscosity of the mixture) than on the shear stress. The peculiarities of rouleaux formation were assessed and their impact on the local shear stress and, therefore, on the internal wall was determined in relation to the erythrocyte concentration.

Conclusion

The results of this research take into account certain geometrical peculiarities of the branching part of the vessel. The mathematical model created in this study will improve our understanding of the complex mechanism of blunt injury to the vascular wall and, therefore, conditions such as aortic rupture and traumatic acute myocardial infarction.

For sex chromosome mechanisms, it directs 'Use XY* model to discover X effect or Y effect', 'Manipulate expression of specific X or Y genes to discover which genes account for sex chromosome effect', and 'Identify downstream molecular effects of sex chromosome genes in specific cell types mediating sex differences'; if no difference is observed, 'Consider sex-specific effects that counterbalance each other'.

Physical basis for multimodal diagnostic coupling

Diagnostics of electromagnetic systems involve measuring photons or waves to determine the physical quantities of these systems through post-processing. Due to the nature of the systems, these diagnostics are connected. Firstly, the measured signals are interconnected through electromagnetic interactions during system events. Additionally, the physical quantities obtained from signal processing are closely linked through momentum balances. Electromagnetic plasma quantities are governed by a series of momentum equations that encompass variables such as density, flow, temperature, and higher-order terms. Figure 8 illustrates the momentum equations for plasma density (n) and temperature (T), where D represents particle diffusivity, v is plasma flow, S n is the particle source, q denotes heat flux, B stands for magnetic field, j is plasma current, S T is the heat source, and (α, β) are constant coefficients determined by plasma properties. These equations demonstrate how the measured plasma quantities are interrelated both spatially and temporally. For instance, the line-averaged density obtained from Interferometer diagnostics is geometrically linked to the local density measured by TS by its definition. Simultaneously, temperatures measured by TS and ECE diagnostics, which are positioned differently, are spatially coupled through the gradient term in the momentum equations. Although the TS density and temperature do not directly interact in the equations, they are tightly linked via diffusive fluxes influenced by turbulence, flow, and sources in a self-consistent manner. This intricate physical coupling of various diagnostic measurements allows ML to identify and predict their interconnections effectively.

Underlying physical coupling among fusion diagnostics enabling multimodal learning.

The diagnostics are connected through electromagnetic interactions between signals. Simultaneously, derived quantities from these signals are coupled via geometric definitions, momentum balances, and high-order physics, including turbulence, flow, and source in the system.

When, equation 7 simplifies toand rays from a point with positionatare conjugate with a point with position y at T. For a conjugate system, A represents the transverse magnification. For a Gaussian system, where A is the familiar transverse magnification in a conjugate system. The transference for a conjugate system is also referred to as the object-image matrix. For example, from a reading plane to the retina of an eye that is accommodated at the reading plane.

For, equation 8 becomes. A pencil of parallel rays entering an afocal system will exit parallel. D represents an angular magnification. For a Gaussian system this is the familiar.

Finally, if equation 8 becomesand rays entering the system from a point with positiononwill emerge from the system all with the same inclination. Such a system is entrance-plane focal. This is the situation, for example, in ophthalmoscopy. The entrance plane is the retina and the exit plane is the cornea of an emmetropic eye. Light is traversing the eye in the reverse sense. The optical system is a reversed eye.

Some of these special systems are used to obtain certain familiar derived properties. Each of A, B, C and D, when applied in this manner, are generalised magnifications.

### Two-dimensional materials in functional three-dimensional architectures with applications in photodetection and imaging [^06a20ff4]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Real-time imaging of incident light

As mentioned previously, the passage of the laser beam through the transparent 3D system provides additional locations for determining the direction of the beam: an exit (P 2) in addition to an entry (P 1) (Fig. 3e). Figure 3f shows the mapping result for a representative case. As indicated in the bar graphs, the photoresponses of devices nearest to P 1 are slightly stronger than those at P 2, due simply to partial reflections and absorption (the device surface transmits 87% of the incident light). The direction of the incident beam (P 1 → P 2) follows from the spherical locations of the P 1 and P 2 vectors with respect to the hemisphere center. The P 1 → P 2 direction can be defined in terms of the azimuthal angle θ in the x – y plane and the polar angle φ between the x – y plane and z direction (Fig. 3g). This simple example extends naturally to more complex cases involving movement of the laser beam in θ, φ, and both planes. For present purposes, we explore three scenarios: (1) increasing θ from −45.0° to 45.0° while fixing φ at 90.0°, (2) decreasing φ from 90.0° to 67.5° while fixing θ at 0.0°, and (3) increasing θ from 45.0° to 135° and φ from 67.5° to 112.5°. In each, three combinations of θ and φ are tested, as shown in Fig. 4, with the laser beam incident on top of the 3D system. The direction (P 1 → P 2) can be expressed in spherical coordinates θ and φ. In all combinations in the three scenarios (nine experiments in total), the θ and φ coordinates calculated from the measured photoresponses match the coordinates directly measured with a protractor scale (Supplementary Fig. 17), as summarized in panels (a)–(c) of Fig. 4 along with the spatial mapping of the photoresponse. Corresponding bar graphs are in Supplementary Fig. 18. Note that although the system can map 360° rotations of θ in the x − y plane, the φ movement is limited by the array geometry, which imposes lower and upper circumferences on the hemispherical surface; see Supplementary Fig. 19. Simple modifications allow up to 45° movement of φ (Supplementary Fig. 20). All measurements and analysis can be performed in real time, as shown in the video clip of the supporting materials (Supplementary Movie 3). Further, the degree of accuracy in determining the position and direction improves with decreases in the distances between photoresistors and in the laser spot sizes (Supplementary Figs. 21 and 22). Moreover, the representative 3D photodetector showed good imaging capability in kHz range (Supplementary Fig. 23).

### Recovery after stroke: not so proportional after all? [^d3259e7a]. Brain (2019). Medium credibility.

Spurious r(X,Δ) are likely when σ Y /σ X is small

For any X and Y, it can be shown that:

A formal proof of Equation 1 is provided in the Supplementary material, Appendix A [proposition 4 and theorem 1; also see]; its consequence is that r(X,Δ) is a function of r(X, Y) and σ Y /σ X. To illustrate that function, we performed a series of simulations (Supplementary material, Appendix B) in which r(X, Y) and σ Y /σ X were varied independently. Figure 2 illustrates the results: a surface relating r(X,Δ) to r(X, Y) and σ Y /σ X. Figure 3 shows example recovery data at six points of interest on that surface.

Figure 2
The relationship between r(X, Y), r(X,Δ) and σ Y /σ X. Note that the x -axis is log-transformed to ensure symmetry around 1; when X and Y are equally variable, log(σ Y /σ X) = 0. Supplementary material, proposition 7 in Appendix A, provides a justification for unambiguously using a ratio of standard deviations in this figure, rather than σ Y and σ X as separate axes. The two major regimes of Equation 1 are also marked in red. In Regime 1, Y is more variable than X, so contributes more variance to Δ, and r(X,Δ) ≈ r(X, Y). In Regime 2, X is more variable than Y, so X contributes more variance to Δ, and r(X,Δ) ≈ r(X,−X) (i.e. −1). The transition between the two regimes, when the variability ratio is not dramatically skewed either way, also allows for spurious r(X,Δ). For the purposes of illustration, the figure also highlights six points of interest on the surface, marked A–F; examples of simulated recovery data corresponding to these points are provided in Fig. 3.

### A system for the generation of curves on 3D brain images [^10d42c42]. Human Brain Mapping (2001). Low credibility.

In this study, a computational optimal system for the generation of curves on triangulated surfaces representing 3D brains is described. The algorithm is based on optimally computing geodesics on the triangulated surfaces following Kimmel and Sethian ([1998]: Proc Natl Acad Sci 95:15). The system can be used to compute geodesic curves for accurate distance measurements as well as to detect sulci and gyri. These curves are defined based on local surface curvatures that are computed following a novel approach presented in this study. The corresponding software is available to the research community.

### Computational methods for the estimation of ideal current patterns in realistic human models [^2f5b4b1d]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To introduce a method for the estimation of the ideal current patterns (ICP) that yield optimal signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for realistic heterogeneous tissue models in MRI.

Theory and Methods

The ICP were calculated for different surfaces that resembled typical radiofrequency (RF) coil formers. We constructed numerical electromagnetic (EM) bases to accurately represent EM fields generated by RF current sources located on the current-bearing surfaces. Using these fields as excitations, we solved the volume integral equation and computed the EM fields in the sample. The fields were appropriately weighted to calculate the optimal SNR and the corresponding ICP. We demonstrated how to qualitatively use ICP to guide the design of a coil array to maximize SNR inside a head model.

Results

In agreement with previous analytic work, ICP formed large distributed loops for voxels in the middle of the sample and alternated between a single loop and a figure-eight shape for a voxel 3-cm deep in the sample's cortex. For the latter voxel, a surface quadrature loop array inspired by the shape of the ICP reached 87.5% of the optimal SNR at 3T, whereas a single loop placed above the voxel reached only 55.7% of the optimal SNR. At 7T, the performance of the two designs decreased to 79.7% and 49.8%, respectively, suggesting that loops could be suboptimal at ultra-high field MRI.

Conclusion

ICP can be calculated for human tissue models, potentially guiding the design of application-specific RF coil arrays.

### Mapping two-dimensional polar active fluids to two-dimensional soap and one-dimensional sandblasting [^ad46a7b7]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Calculation of the nonlinear lengths

The nonlinear lengths ξ x, y can be calculated most conveniently from the equilibrium 2D smectic model (51). By definition, ξ x and ξ y are the lengths along x and y beyond which the anharmonic terms in equation (51) become important. To determine these lengths, we treat the anharmonic terms perturbatively, and calculate the lowest order correction to the harmonic terms. In a finite system of linear dimensions L x, y, this 'perturbative' correction will indeed be perturbative (that is, small) compared with the 'bare' values of the harmonic terms. However, they grow without bound with increasing L x, y, and, hence, eventually cease to be small; that is, the perturbation theory breaks down at large L x, y. The values of L x, y above which the perturbation theory breaks down are the nonlinear lengths ξ x, y.

Calculating the lowest order correction to the compression modulus B (that is, the coefficient of (∂ y h) 2 in the smectic Hamiltonian (51)) can be graphically represented by the Feynman diagram in Fig. 3. This leads to a correction to compression modulus:

In this calculation, we have taken L y, the system size along y, to be infinite. By the definition of ξ x, | δB | = B for L x = ξ x, which gives

where in the second equality we have used the relations B = 2 αv 0 2, and k B T = D between the parameters of the smectic and those of the original incompressible active fluid.

Likewise, doing the same calculation for L y = ξ y, L x = ∞, we find

### Graphics and statistics for cardiology: clinical prediction rules [^6c53ce35]. Heart (2017). Low credibility.

Graphs and tables are indispensable aids to quantitative research. When developing a clinical prediction rule that is based on a cardiovascular risk score, there are many visual displays that can assist in developing the underlying statistical model, testing the assumptions made in this model, evaluating and presenting the resultant score. All too often, researchers in this field follow formulaic recipes without exploring the issues of model selection and data presentation in a meaningful and thoughtful way. Some ideas on how to use visual displays to make wise decisions and present results that will both inform and attract the reader are given. Ideas are developed, and results tested, using subsets of the data that were used to develop the ASSIGN cardiovascular risk score, as used in Scotland.

### J-shapedness: an often missed, often miscalculated relation: the example of weight and mortality [^9e991138]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2014). Low credibility.

We present three considerations in analysing the association between weight and mortality, as well as other relations that might be non-linear in nature. First, authors must graphically plot their independent and dependent variables in a continuous manner. Second, authors should assess the shape of that relation, and note its shape. If it is non-linear, and specifically, J-shaped or U-shaped, careful consideration should be given to using the 'best' statistical model, of which multivariate fractional polynomial regression is a reasonable choice. Authors should also refrain from truncating their data to avoid dealing with non-linear relations.

### Graphic representation of skeletal maturity determinations [^e743c587]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

Skeletal maturation determinations are usually reported as numeric data indicating accordance with chronologic age. However, significant changes in skeletal maturation can occur without falling outside two SDs. The purpose of our study was to design simple computer-generated sex-based charts to enhance the evaluation of skeletal maturation, especially when frequent assessments are made.

Conclusion

The graphic representation of successive reports clearly depicts whether values retain their position in relation to the mean. In addition, the report includes computation of the exact SD score.

### Shifting the optimal stiffness for cell migration [^8ce326d8]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Simulation analysis

The random motility coefficient (μ) for simulated two-dimensional cell migration was defined similarly to a diffusion coefficient as in equation (12).

In this equation, 〈 r 2 〉 is the mean squared displacement of the cell centre in a given time interval, t. From this relation, μ can be calculated from the slope of 〈 r 2 〉 versus t. This plot was generated for each simulated cell according to the overlap method of mean squared displacement calculation. In this method, all displacements at all possible time intervals are used to generate the plot. To correspond to our experimental cell migration experiments, simulation data at 15 min intervals was used to calculate mean squared displacements, and the first hour of each simulation were excluded from analysis to allow the system to reach steady state (Supplementary Fig. 5). In addition, large displacements in the simulated cell centre of 1 μm s −1 were removed. A linear trend line intersecting the origin and inversely weighted by the uncertainty in each data point was fit to the first half of the 〈 r 2 〉 versus t data for each simulated cell. The random motility coefficient was calculated from the slope of the trend line and averaged across all simulated cells at a given condition to obtain the mean random motility coefficient for that condition.

Simulated cell morphology was determined by creating a geometric shape based on the position outputs of the simulation. First, a 10 μm radius circle was centred at the cell body position. Then, 10 μm was added to the length of each module to account for the module starting at the edge of the cell body rather than the central point. Tangent lines to the cell circle were then drawn to connect the module tips to the central circle. The resulting shape was then analysed for aspect ratio using MATLAB 'regionprops' function. Simulation movies depicting cell shape and migration are provided for 0.1, 10 and 1,000 pN nm −1 substrates (Supplementary Movie 1).

Finally, the F-actin flow rate was calculated by taking the mean of the F-actin flow rates for each module, and the traction force was calculated by summing the magnitudes of the force on each module as well as the cell body.

### Regulation of global transcription inby rsd and 6S RNA [^6b97a156]. G3 (2018). Low credibility.

To understand how Rsd and 6S RNA regulate competition between sigma factors, we initially modeled the formation of Eσ 70 and Eσ 38 in the absence of DNA. This is represented by the shaded area in Figure 6A and steady-state equations (1) - (9) in Methods. Figure 6B (i) depicts what happens when Rsd is added to a system containing only E, σ 70 and σ 38. Each value of Rsd on the x -axis corresponds to a separate 'run' of the model where we compute the steady-state for those parameter values, before moving on to the next Rsd value. We predict that as Rsd is increased, it sequesters σ 70, reducing Eσ 70 formation. This allows more E to bind σ 38, increasing the formation of Eσ 38, consistent with previous predictions of Rsd function.

However, Figure 6B (ii) predicts that when 6S RNA is also present, Rsd increases Eσ 38 with little effect on Eσ 70. How? This paradoxical result can be understood with Figure 6B (iii), which shows that the concentration of the 6S RNA–Eσ 70 complex decreases as Rsd is increased. When 6S RNA is present, increasing Rsd still reduces E-σ 70 association; however, the reduction in Eσ 70 is compensated for by the release of Eσ 70 from its complex with 6S RNA, and so there is little change in the overall Eσ 70 level. This prediction remains when we include DNA in the model (represented by the complete schematic in Figure 6A). Figure 6B (iv) shows that simulating increased Rsd increases transcription by Eσ 38 with less effect on Eσ 70 transcription.

### A pluripotent progression of the gate control system theory of pain-modeling ascending&descending pain pathways as a lotka-volterra coupled control&feedback loop [^76b3e445]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Figure 2 shows schematically the motivation (Figure 2, left) for a simple coupled control and feedback loop system to model the influence of a sensory input (ie, pain stimulus) on the pain perception and pain modulation (Figure 2, right). Figure 2, right in particular shows the ascending pathway from the sensory input to the pain perception, as well as the descending pathway from the pain perception to the pain modulation, which in turn influences the ascending pathway from the sensory input to the pain perception, eg, in a mitigating fashion.

Figure 2
Representation of integrated pain pathways in an elementary control system diagram.

To model mathematically this coupled control and feedback loop system, based on previous applications of control system design to other sensory input processes, and Lotka-Volterra predator-prey interaction models, we introduced three time-dependent, interacting variables: sensory input (ie, pain stimulus) S(t), pain perception P(t), and modulation M(t). These variables can be thought of as concentrations or intensities in arbitrary units for the following discussion. As such, it is assumed that S(t), P(t), and M(t) are greater or equal to 0, ie, in particular non-negative. In the following, it is important to note that the time profile of the sensory input S(t) is directly modeled a priori, ie, no differential equations are necessary to describe the time change of S(t). Example Sensory Input Modeling for Future Clinical Applications below provides a detailed discussion of example sensory input functions S(t) tested.

Originally, Lotka-Volterra models have been widely used in ecology to understand the underlying dynamics of predator-prey relationships and how species interact within an ecosystem. These models are mathematically represented by systems of differential equations that predict how the populations of typically two (sometimes more) interacting species change over time. Of particular importance – and rendering these models so powerful – are the non-linear coupling terms between these interacting species, which turn the differential equations into highly coupled differential equations. The main contribution and novelty of our approach is applying the Lotka-Volterra population dynamics to the modeling of the relationship and interaction between pain and modulation, since this relationship and interaction exhibit time-delayed interconnectedness and cyclical fluctuations. As such, using Lotka-Volterra dynamics as the basis for the ascending-descending pathway pain model proposed by us is a well-founded and well-understood approach both mathematically and modeling wise.

### A framework for motion correction of background suppressed arterial spin labeling perfusion images acquired with simultaneous multi-slice EPI [^62b9268e]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

From the M 0 images, 7 time series of 60 dynamic images each were generated, and 6 different types of motion (translation in the x‐, y‐, and z‐direction and rotation around the x‐, y‐ and z‐axes) were applied to 6 of them. As illustrated in Figure 2, each type of motion has a 4‐step pattern in a single time series: ± 1.4 and ± 2.8 fractional pixel translation (± 4.2 and ± 8.4 mm) in the x‐ and y‐direction, ± 0.6 and ± 1.2 fractional slice shift (± 4.2 and ± 8.4 mm) in the z‐direction, and ± 3 and ± 6° rotation around the x‐, y‐, and z‐axes. One time series was untouched (no‐motion data set). By using the T 1 map, the pixel‐wise signal attenuation as a result of 2 BGS inversion pulses (TI = 1860 and 3150 ms) was calculated, in which different PLDs for the multi‐slice acquisition were incorporated by assuming an interval of 30 ms between 2 subsequent excitation pulses; SMS acquisition with factor 3 was assumed and the following standard Bloch‐equation was used for calculating the evolution of the longitudinal magnetization

Figure 2
Motion applied to the simulated data set: ± 1.4 and 2.8 fractional pixel translation (± 4.2 and 8.4 mm) in the x‐ and y‐direction, ± 0.6 and 1.2 fractional slice shift (± 4.2 and 8.4 mm) in z‐direction, and ± 3 and 6° rotation around the x‐, y‐, and z‐axes

where M z (t) is the longitudinal magnetization at time point t, M 0 and T 1 are pixel‐wise values from the M 0 image and T 1 map, respectively. Afterward, perfusion‐like signal changes were incorporated to the even dynamic numbers to represent the labeled images. Perfusion‐like signal was only added to the left side of the brain, thereby keeping the right side without perfusion, in which all signal intensity that would appear after the post‐processing will be a measure of the artefactual signal as a result of applied post‐processing without any influence of the underlying perfusion pattern. Using these data sets, 2 studies were carried out.

### A general model for ontogenetic growth [^10660e44]. Nature (2001). Excellent credibility.

Several equations have been proposed to describe ontogenetic growth trajectories for organisms justified primarily on the goodness of fit rather than on any biological mechanism. Here, we derive a general quantitative model based on fundamental principles for the allocation of metabolic energy between maintenance of existing tissue and the production of new biomass. We thus predict the parameters governing growth curves from basic cellular properties and derive a single parameterless universal curve that describes the growth of many diverse species. The model provides the basis for deriving allometric relationships for growth rates and the timing of life history events.

### A physical wiring diagram for the human immune system [^17fe0769]. Nature (2022). Excellent credibility.

Source data.

Our quantitative wiring diagram, if truly systematic to the point of approaching completeness, should make it possible to derive a reductionist model that explains how circulating immune cells associate with each other solely from receptor-binding mechanisms and physics-based formulas. We built a coarse yet principled mathematical model that integrates quantitative proteomics expression, binding kinetics and published cell parameters to summarize the contributions of individual protein interactions to a given cellular interaction (Fig. 2f and Supplementary Equations). Using equations based on the law of mass action, the model then computes how the overall probability of binding between two cell types emerges from the distinct spectrum of cell-surface receptors that connect them (Extended Data Fig. 7). Although greatly simplistic, our model could still infer the relative frequencies at which human immune cells physically interact with sufficient precision to be consistent with published empirical measurements(Fig. 2g and Extended Data Fig. 7d).

### Development of a 7 T RF coil system for breast imaging [^6b01ba48]. NMR in Biomedicine (2017). Low credibility.

To evaluate the feasibility of parallel MRI, geometry (G) factor maps were acquired in the spherical phantom. An acceleration factor (R) from 1 to 4 was applied with 3D gradient echo in the anterior–posterior (AP) direction in the sagittal and transverse planes and in the head-feet (HF) direction in the coronal plane. Imaging parameters are T R / T E = 4/2 ms, FA = 10°, in-plane resolution = 1.25 × 1.25 mm 2, and slice thickness = 1.25 mm. A relatively small in-plane field of view (FOV) (160 mm × 160 mm) was used for G -map acquisition due to the high background noise. We purposely did not mask the background of the G maps to show the relative noise increase in the background. The G map was calculated using the following equation:where SNR (x, y, z) is the SNR map of the MR images, and x, y, and z represent locations in the Cartesian coordinate system.

A 7 T 3D dual-echo steady state sequence was used to compare SNR with and without the Rx-only array in the breast phantom; T R / T E = 30/5 ms, FA = 25°, in-plane resolution = 0.8 × 0.8 mm 2, and slice thickness = 0.8 mm.

For the SNR calculation, four square regions in the coronal plane were selected to calculate the standard deviation of the noise (white dotted boxes in Figure 5A later) and SNR was then calculated by dividing the image intensity, pixel by pixel, by the noise. In addition, CNR was calculated between the FG and fat tissues in order to measure the image quality. Equations used for the SNR and CNR calculation arewhere SI is the signal intensity, noise is standard deviation calculated from four corner ROIs, and f is fat tissue in the breast. x, y, and z are the pixel locations in the MR images.

In vivo 3D T 1 -weighted breast images were acquired at isotropic resolution (0.6 mm) using a GRE sequence with fat saturation at 7 T (with and without Rx-only array) and at 3 T. SNRs were then compared; T R / T E = 21/2.8 ms, FA = 25°, FOV = 150 × 150 mm 2, matrix = 256 × 256, slice thickness = 0.6 mm, and total scan time = 7 min 40 s.

### What do-omics mean for the science and policy of the nutritional sciences? [^3b47c130]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2006). Low credibility.

The development of systems biology is revolutionizing the way we are studying and learning about human health. It is a way of thinking and a systematic attempt to integrate information from several fields of study (physical, biological, chemical, engineering, etc) to develop a more kinetic and real-time understanding of complex biological processes. It uses mathematical modeling tools to chart dynamic interactions between the components of a biological system, eg, genes, transcripts, proteins, metabolites, and cells, to simulate and analyze networks and pathways and the spatial and temporal relations that exist in biological systems. The term -omics represents the rigorous study of various collections of molecules, biological processes, or physiologic functions and structures as systems, represented most prominently by genomics. In the field of nutrition, had a systems approach been applied to evaluating the effect of vitamin A status on mortality rates in young children in developing countries, it might not have taken 20 y to go from the initial epidemiologic observations to global vitamin A supplementation programs. Better understanding of the functional biology of retinoids on different tissues that mediate host resistance to infection, and their synergistic interactions in biological, metabolic, and functional terms, could have provided a plausible mechanism for the observed effect on mortality. There are 3 policy take-home messages: 1) When controversies exist, invest in the science needed to sort them out. 2) Increase the amounts of money available for health research and interventions relevant to developing countries. 3) Ensure that policymakers understand the issues and why they are important and understand the science and its relevance.

### Basic mapping principles for visualizing cancer data using geographic information systems (GIS) [^636f342e]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Maps and other data graphics may play a role in generating ideas and hypotheses at the beginning of a project. They are useful as part of analyses for evaluating model results and then at the end of a project when researchers present their results and conclusions to varied audiences, such as their local research group, decision makers, or a concerned public. Cancer researchers are gaining skill with geographic information system (GIS) mapping as one of their many tools and are broadening the symbolization approaches they use for investigating and illustrating their data. A single map is one of many possible representations of the data, so making multiple maps is often part of a complete mapping effort. Symbol types, color choices, and data classing each affect the information revealed by a map and are best tailored to the specific characteristics of data. Related data can be examined in series with coordinated classing and can also be compared using multivariate symbols that build on the basic rules of symbol design. Informative legend wording and setting suitable map projections are also basic to skilled mapmaking.

For each of various C between 2.0 and 5.0, we used Equation (6) to form confidence intervals for mortality risks at selected birthweights, namely r 1 (μ 1 - σ 1), r 1 (μ 1), r 1 (μ 1 + σ 1), r 2 (μ 2 - σ 2), r 2 (μ 2), r 2 (μ 2 + σ 2), r 3 (μ 3 - σ 3), r 3 (μ 3), r 3 (μ 3 + σ 3), r 4 (μ 4 - σ 4), r 4 (μ 4), and r 4 (μ 4 + σ 4). Above, μ j and σ j denote the mean and standard deviation of the birthweights in component j (1 ≤ j ≤ 4). This was repeated nine more times, and we tabulated how many of the 120 = 12 × 10 confidence intervals contained their targets. Confidence intervals were also formed using Equation (5) for comparative purposes. The above steps were repeated with overlapping data sets consistent with a population of 1,000,000 and with nonoverlapping data sets consistent with an effectively infinite population.

Table 2
Mixture Model and Mortality Functions for Simulation Study

The probability density for the mixture model used in our simulation study is specified, as are the mortality risk functions associated with the mixture model components. Above, z is defined as (x - 3000)/1000, where x is birthweight in grams.

The results are summarized in Table 3. With an effectively infinite population, only 75.0% of the confidence intervals formed using Equation (5) contained their targets at C = 5.0. On the other hand, the confidence intervals formed using Equation (6) contained their targets 95.0% of the time at C = 4.0. The latter finding provided the rationale for taking C 0 = 4.0 when constructing confidence intervals for mortality risks in our examples with real data.

The article by Brown et al. regarding the Fredrickson and Losada (see record 2005-11834-001) article discussed the use of differential equations in science and repeated our earlier observation (Luoma, Hämäläinen, & Saarinen, 2008) that there is lack of justification for the use of the Lorenz equations in the latter article. In this comment we want to point out that Brown et al. presented a very narrow view on mathematical modeling in behavioral research. We describe how the conceptual use of mathematical models is essential in many fields.

Spirometry reporting specifies that numerical values are given for the FEV1, the FVC, and the FEV1/FVC ratio; the latter should be reported as a decimal fraction and the space for percent predicted value left blank, and if bronchodilators are given the LLN column need not be repeated with absolute and percent change given only for FEV1 and FVC. Other numerical values such as the forced inspiratory flow at 75% of FVC (FEF75%) and FEF25–75% are not recommended for routine use. Graph requirements include that for the volume–time curve the volume scale should be at least 10 mm/L, the time scale at least 20 mm/s, and 1 second prior to the start of expiration should be displayed; on the flow–volume plot the flow display should be at least 5 l/min/L/s, and the ratio of flow to volume should be 2 L/s to 1 L, and linear and log scales where values are plotted as z-scores relative to the predicted value (z = 0) give an intuitive sense of severity.

FIGURE 7
In the first row, spatial distribution in the plane y = 0 of the index of stress associated to the heating induced by the magnetic field generated by a tubular gradient coil system during the application of a 3D FISP pulse sequence. The isotropic index (Equation [3]) and the anisotropic index (Equation [4]) for 3 implants with weighting coefficient estimated from the peak temperature increase after 900 s are reported. In the second row, for each implant, the correlation between the anisotropic index of stress and the peak temperature increase after 900 s is shown by evaluating them when the implant is located in the position denoted by the white circles in the color maps. The considered implants are those implanted in the Yoon‐Sun model

For each implant, the correlation between I aniso and Δ T max,900s computed by simulating the implant exposed to the actual non‐uniform magnetic field generated by the GC system when located in different positions is reported in Figure 7. For this analysis, the barycenter of each implant is moved in the plane y = 0 along the x ‐axis (from 0.025 m to 0.275 m in 0.05 m steps) at the quote z = 0.3 m. The reported plots put in evidence the linear correlation between the 2 quantities. The angular coefficients of the linear regressions with the 3D FISP pulse sequence are ∼1.8 mK/(T 2 /s 2), ∼0.9 mK/(T 2 /s 2), and ∼1.5 mK/(T 2 /s 2) for the hip, knee, and shoulder implants, respectively. When the EPI‐X pulse sequence is used, the coefficients are ∼2.0 mK/(T 2 /s 2), ∼1.1 mK/(T 2 /s 2), and ∼1.5 mK/(T 2 /s 2).

### Quantifying disorder one atom at a time using an interpretable graph neural network paradigm [^706e873d]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

While γ describes the level of disorder of a macroscopic, homogeneously disordered system, we are primarily interested in local atomic disorder within a heterogeneous system. To establish a connection between the global and local scales, we map the likelihood of finding a given local atomic environment within an ensemble of configurations to a local order parameter (SODAS), λ (n), where n indexes an atom. One can think of λ (n) as defining which temperatures you are most likely to find a given atomic environment, but mapped to a point along a phase space trajectory between two phases, A and B. In practice, due to ergodic constraints, we assume that this ensemble can be sampled discretely from MD simulations. We represent this mapping as:where { γ } i = { γ 1, γ 2. γ k } represents the set of γ values associated with a given local atomic structural motif i across a discrete set of k ensembles, and f is a function that maps { γ } i to λ (n). It is important to understand that we are arguing a local atomic environment may be represented as the set of points along the order-to-disorder spectrum, rather than its geometric symmetries (or lack thereof). We would argue that this definition provides a more grounded representation of the local environment as it can be mapped back onto a physical system, rather than an unsupervised feature vector. While the function f is unknown, it can be approximated. In this work, we use a graph neural network scheme to facilitate this approximation, while retaining physical interpretability. It is also important to understand that the GNN is not predicting the temperature of a local environment but rather the point along the order-to-disorder spectrum that the local environment is most likely to exist at. One may think of this scheme as optimizing a high-dimensional non-linear function that maps the temperature of the system to the point along a path between two phases in a representative configuration space. We also note that s can be iteratively tuned for a given system by using an initial guess and observing the error between the predicted average λ for a structure and the theoretical gamma at the known thermostat temperature during training. Figure 1 outlines the key steps in this process and is discussed in further detail in the methods section.

### Quantitative imaging metrics for the assessment of pulmonary pathophysiology: an official American Thoracic Society and Fleischner society joint workshop report [^bf529881]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2023). High credibility.

Applying imaging metrics in computational modeling to predict lung function highlights that modeling supports the acquisition, analysis, and interpretation of images and provides data to aid the development and refinement of physiological models. Because imaging modalities offer complementary information and no single method captures all measures simultaneously, the goal is to integrate multimodal image data with physiological measurements to characterize how structure determines function, and quantitative linking of lung structure and function can be done only through computational modeling based on the laws of physics. Given the complexity and multifactorial nature of respiratory diseases, structure-based models that include interactions among tissue, airway, and circulation can facilitate analysis and interpretation of how intersubject differences, imaging protocols, and normal or abnormal physiology contribute to imaging-based metrics, and carefully constructed models can examine contributions of different factors and provide mechanistic understanding beyond statistical methods. General principles state that biophysical computational models can be used for forward simulations of function or inverse identification of system structure and parameters; forward models are useful for sensitivity analyses and can predict emergent behavior in response to parameter changes, whereas inverse models can derive information that cannot be measured directly.

### Physics-informed deep learning approach for modeling crustal deformation [^b6ab13d3]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

The movement and deformation of the Earth's crust and upper mantle provide critical insights into the evolution of earthquake processes and future earthquake potentials. Crustal deformation can be modeled by dislocation models that represent earthquake faults in the crust as defects in a continuum medium. In this study, we propose a physics-informed deep learning approach to model crustal deformation due to earthquakes. Neural networks can represent continuous displacement fields in arbitrary geometrical structures and mechanical properties of rocks by incorporating governing equations and boundary conditions into a loss function. The polar coordinate system is introduced to accurately model the displacement discontinuity on a fault as a boundary condition. We illustrate the validity and usefulness of this approach through example problems with strike-slip faults. This approach has a potential advantage over conventional approaches in that it could be straightforwardly extended to high dimensional, anelastic, nonlinear, and inverse problems.

### Large-scale simulation of biomembranes incorporating realistic kinetics into coarse-grained models [^73f93c89]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Fig. 1
Overview of the proposed method for anisotropic stochastic dynamics of a coarse-grained membrane model.

a Schematic of a coarse-grained membrane model with the two leaflets resolved. For a membrane suspended in solvent, distinct membrane and solvent domains are designated. The local coordinate system describing the in-plane and out-of-plane directions, as well as the distributed boundary conditions and the fluid response are shown for a selected particle. b Schematic of the proposed method for handling anisotropic stochastic dynamics. c Three distinct idealized geometries used in the derivation of the fluid response: (i) single planar membrane, (ii) parallel planar membranes, (iii) spherical vesicle. The cell membrane of a human red blood cell can be considered to experience fluid responses approximated by a combination of the three geometries.

As the breakdown chart in Fig. 1b suggests, we use the Saffman–Delbrück model of the diffusion of cylindrical inclusions in fluid sheets to obtain the in-plane components,(Eq. (11)). Other choices are also possible, provided that they are consistent with the macroscopic viscosity of the membrane (see "In-plane diffusion coefficient" under Methods section, and also ref.for a discussion on how to make this connection). However, there are no readily available descriptions of hydrodynamics yielding out-of-plane components,… To derive numerical values for these components, we have developed semi-analytical solutions to the Stokes equations in select idealized geometries (Fig. 1b and c).

The underlying approach is to use Gaussian distributed velocity or stress boundary conditions as the test input, and numerically integrate the resulting fields over selected patches on the surface of the membrane, i.e. find the generated forces or displacements which describe the fluid response (Fig. 1a). For the simple case of a single planar membrane, we have found a closed form solution for, where, with α being a scaling parameter corresponding to the width of the Gaussians used as input, A p is the area per particle, and I 0 and I 1 are the modified Bessel functions of the first kind. The problem is not, of course, tractable for arbitrary geometries. However, based on the solutions presented in ref. it is possible to find numerical results specific to a membrane model, using the scheme depicted in Fig. 2a. We have derived the results for several prototypical membrane geometries, based on our previously developed membrane model (Fig. 2b).

RESULTS

PTA and Its Components (3D)

Figure 2 shows all tibial acceleration components over the complete stance phase, for the x and z axes in Ψ IMU f at the proximal IMU location. Tables 1 and 2 show the acceleration values at both IMU locations and over all speeds for the x and z axes in Ψ IMU f, respectively. Contribution of the y axis in Ψ IMU f was limited and therefore not shown here (see Supplemental Table 1, Supplemental Digital Content, Data of y axis in Ψ IMU f).

Axial axis (z axis in Ψ IMU f). Table 1 shows all accelerations components in the z axis in Ψ IMU f. PTA IMU z only increases over speed (P < 0.001, F = 67.62, η 2 = 0.83) for both IMU locations. Centripetal acceleration around the y axis increases over speed, whereas centripetal acceleration around the x axis has a relatively small contribution. Distal and proximal PTA ankle z values only show a significance difference over speed (P < 0.001, F = 90.92, η 2 = 0.87).

Figure 3 shows the difference between PTA IMU z and PTA ankle z. Proximally, a significant difference over speed (P < 0.001, F = 6.86, η 2 = 0.83) and their interaction (P < 0.001, F = 57.31, η 2 = 0.80) are observed. Distally, changes are observed over speed (P < 0.001, F = 66.72, η 2 = 0.83), measure (P < 0.001, F = 57.87, η 2 = 0.81), and their interaction (P < 0.001, F = 73.43, η 2 = 0.84).

### Automated assessment of cervical dystonia [^14f1ab5b]. Movement Disorders (2003). Low credibility.

We developed an automated and objective method to measure posture and voluntary movements in patients with cervical dystonia using Fastrack, an electromagnetic system consisting of a stationary transmitter station and four sensors. The junction lines between the sensors attached to the head produced geometrical figures on which the corresponding aspects of the head were superimposed. The head position in the space was reconstructed and observed from axial, sagittal, and coronal planes. Four patients with cervical dystonia and 6 healthy subjects were studied. Each patient was representative of one of the typical patterns of cervical dystonia. The study allowed the authors to collect quantitative data on posture and range of motion of the head. This pilot study demonstrates the efficacy of the Fastrack system to objectively measure the head position in cervical dystonia patients.

### Estimating and testing direct genetic effects in directed acyclic graphs using estimating equations [^36f8fd9e]. Genetic Epidemiology (2018). Low credibility.

Figure 1
Overview of the directed acyclic graph considered in this study. Y is the primary outcome measure of interest; K is a secondary phenotype; X is the genetic marker of interest and α XY is the direct effect of interest. It is assumed thatso that L is a measured predictive factor of K, however, CIEE is also valid if L is a measured confounder of(i.e.and). U represents unmeasured factors and confounders potentially influencing L and Y.

Two traditional methods for the aim to estimateare (i) to include the intermediate phenotypes and factors as covariates in a multiple regression (MR) model of the primary phenotype on the genetic marker, or (ii) to first regress the primary phenotype on the intermediate phenotypes and factors, and then regress the extracted residuals on the genetic marker (regression of residuals, RR). These approaches are frequently used for the analysis of continuous primary phenotypes using a linear regression model, and MR is also a frequently used approach for the analysis of binary or categorical primary phenotypes (using generalized linear regression models), or potentially censored time‐to‐event primary phenotypes (using, for example, proportional hazards (PH) or accelerated failure time (AFT) regression models). However, both traditional approaches can lead to biased point estimates and invalid testing of direct genetic effects on the primary phenotype in some situations, by removing part of the true association or by failing to remove the effect of the intermediate phenotype (i.e. the indirect genetic effect) or unmeasured confounders (Cole & Hernán, 2002; Goetgeluk, Vansteelandt, & Goetghebeur, 2008; Rosenbaum, 1984; Vansteelandt et al. 2009). More elaborate approaches have been proposed to overcome these limitations. The structural equation modeling method (SEM; Bollen, 1989) is a popular approach for modeling DAGs, and has been applied to genetic association studies under similar DAGs as in this study (for example, see Hancock et al. 2015). Further approaches have been developed in studies on causal inference using structural nested models and G‐estimation methods (Goetgeluk et al. 2008; Robins, 1986, 1992; Robins & Greenland, 1994), or the inverse probability weighting method (Robins, Hernán, & Brumback, 2000). A more detailed overview of these approaches can be found in Vansteelandt and Joffe (2014).

Structural equations for simulation Series I: Standard pleiotropy where ε x, i, ε z, i, ε y, i, u i ∼ N (0, 1).

Structural equations for simulation Series II: Z → X where ε x, i, ε z, i, ε y, i, u i ∼ N (0, 1).

In each simulated data set, 100 SNPs (G in Equation (9)) with a minor allele frequency of 0.33 and n = 500 observations were generated, with values coded as (0, 1, 2). Among all 100 SNPs there are p z ∈ {20, 50} SNPs directly related to Z. Notice that smaller values of α x = 0.1 represent weak instruments G for X, while large values of α z = 1 represent strong instruments G for Z. Therefore, our scenarios comprise weak and strong instruments for one or both of X and Z. Two hundred datasets were generated for each scenario, and results compared the estimates and variance of the causal effect, β.

### Building connectomes using diffusion MRI: why, how and but [^e39dcd4d]. NMR in Biomedicine (2019). Medium credibility.

2 BUILDING A CONNECTOME

In vivo MRI methods provide a macroscopic view of the connectome. Connections that can be reconstructed with dMRI and tractography are the extrinsicpathways between regions that traverse white matter. Although these constitute only a small fraction (~10%) of the total number of neuronal connections 26 (the others are intrinsic, intra‐cortical), they are important to study in order to understand the brain at the level of a system and they are characterized by considerable complexity (see Van Essen et al 27 for a review of these complex features).

Inferring a macro‐ connectome from dMRI images is a very challenging task and a field of active research. We divide connectome mapping into two tasks: node delineation and edge mapping (Figure 1). Nodes represent spatially distinct cortical and subcortical gray matter regions, while edges represent the white matter fiber bundles that interconnect pairs of regions.

Figure 1
Generating a macroscale connectome involves estimating its nodes and edges. The nodes are typically gray matter (GM) regions (cortical and subcortical) defined either geometrically, functionally or cyto/myelo‐architectonically. The edges represent connection pathways between the nodes. dMRI and tractography can probe these white matter (WM) connections and estimate relative weights

Scale bars: 1 μm. d Measured eight holographic images under different propagation directions and polarization states of analyzers, corresponding to eight elements of J ±. The white one-way arrows represent the propagation directions of guided waves while the double arrows indicate the output polarization states.

Here, ± denotes the propagation direction of guided waves (+ for +x and +y directions while – for -x and -y directions). a xk, a yk and ϕ xk, ϕ yk are the amplitude and phase responses of induced propagation phase by the k -th naopillar in supercell. The introduction of propagation phase gives rise to the breaking of conjugated relation between J + and J -, i.e.(See Eq. (S6) in Supplementary Note 2.2). Considering that the above direction-dependent Jones matrices are asymmetric and non-unitary, eight elements of two sets of Jones matrices (J ± xx, J ± xy, J ± yx, J ± yy) could be engineered at will. Based on Eq. (4), eight phase-only modulation channels are designed to confirm the direction-multiplexed modulation capability by selecting variables of four-element supercells through genetic algorithm optimization shown in Supplementary Note 3 with optimized results listed in Fig. S 6a. The validity of such direction-multiplexed modulation design has been confirmed through numerical simulations, as plotted in Fig. S 6b. Figures 4b, c showcase the top and side view of the fabricated sample, respectively. As captured in Fig. 4d, the holographic images exhibit four letters "HOLO" under input guided waves along y and x directions while another four different holographic images "GRAM" are demonstrated for guided waves along -y and -x directions when switching the polarization states of analyzer. The conjugacy of two equivalent Jones matrices J + and J - has been totally broken and it contributes to the eight direction-multiplexed phase modulation channels.

Configuration 1

The purpose of the first configuration is to test the estimation methods with known ground‐truth IVIM‐DTI parameters. The D * equivalent of flow has a known analytical expression in a system of identically oriented tubes (mimicking vessels) with Gaussian distributed velocities 22. In the first simulation configuration shown in Figure 1 a, we considered such a system with velocities,(0.86 mm/s, 0.34 mm/s) along x ‐axis undergoing "plug" flow 52. The vascular dMRI signal, was generated as 22 where γ is the Gyromagnetic ratio, is a vector along the gradient direction (see 52), is a vector of velocity with magnitude v and = 3 × 10 −3 mm 2 /s is the intrinsic diffusivity of blood. We assumed 20% of the extra‐vascular diffusivity was due to a system of tubes (mimicking axons) with intrinsic diffusivity = 0.0017 mm 2 /s 4, orientationand the rest 80% was due to isotropic diffusion = 8 × 10 −4 mm 2 /s due to the extra‐cellular matrix. The extra‐vascular dMRI signalwas generated as

### Combinatorial summation of feynman diagrams [^42481276]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Feynman's diagrammatic series is a common language for a formally exact theoretical description of systems of infinitely-many interacting quantum particles, as well as a foundation for precision computational techniques. Here we introduce a universal framework for efficient summation of connected or skeleton Feynman diagrams for generic quantum many-body systems. It is based on an explicit combinatorial construction of the sum of the integrands by dynamic programming, at a computational cost that can be made only exponential in the diagram order on a classical computer and potentially polynomial on a quantum computer. We illustrate the technique by an unbiased diagrammatic Monte Carlo calculation of the equation of state of the 2DSU(N) Hubbard model in an experimentally relevant regime, which has remained challenging for state-of-the-art numerical methods.

### An analytical theory of balanced cellular growth [^a5efc002]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Proof: The active stoichiometric matrix A may have more rows than columns. In this case, m + 1 > n, and the rows for exactly n metabolites are linearly independent, as row and column rank must equal. As a consequence, the remaining m + 1 − n metabolite concentrations are linearly dependent on the concentrations of the n independent metabolites. These dependent concentrations are not free variables, and hence they can be put aside and dealt with separately.

We decompose the linear system of equations represented by constraint (11) into two parts, rearranging the rows of A into matrices B, C such that B contains the rows for the independent reactants. As A has full column rank, choosing linearly independent rows results in a square matrix B of full rank (#rows(B) = rank(B) = rank(A)). Let b be the subvector of reactant concentrations a that correspond to the rows of B, and let c be the subvector of the remaining reactant concentrations corresponding to the rows of C. We can then split the mass balance constraint (11) into two separate equations: B is a square matrix of full rank, so there is always a unique inverse B −1. Multiplying both sides of the first equation by B −1 from the left, we obtain the desired equation for v. Inserting this result into the second equation results in the desired equation for c. □

The Lorenz '96 model is a set of coupled, chaotic, ODEs designed to be a simplified model of the climate along a line of constant latitude. The governing equations for this system are given by, for which the boundary conditions are assumed to be periodic (k = 1, 2, …, 1,024).

We generated observation matrices of rank r using the expression, in which eachis a random vector sampled from a standard normal distribution. We studied the performance of our approach in which the rank of the observation matrix is 256, 512 and 1,024. For each experiment, we used 512 snapshots over the time interval of 0 to 10 corrupted by noise that is 2% of the range of the system. We make the assumption that the dynamics are given by, in whichreturns all quadratic polynomial functions that are a function of x i and its two closest neighbours to the left and right of the node. Although we found that we were able to exactly recover the underlying functional form of the governing equations with an observation matrix whose rank was half the dimensionality of the state, further work is required to theoretically establish conditions under which the governing equations can be exactly recovered. These results are summarized in Extended Data Fig. 2.

Because many real-world systems for which governing equations are challenging to derive from first principles are both (1) high-dimensional and (2) challenging to measure, we believe this to be a useful result. Our method has a computational cost that scales linearly in the state dimension and can be applied given an arbitrary observation function. This result opens the door for equation discovery in systems that were previously believed to be too large and/or difficult to measure.

Sampson equation considerations describe potential utility and current evidence gaps: A bivariate quadratic equation published by Sampson and colleagues calculates LDL-C from TG and non–HDL-C and yields accurate estimates for samples with a TG level up to 800 mg/dL, although it may underestimate low LDL-C levels. In samples with normal triglyceride levels, it yields similar results to Martin/Hopkins at low LDL-C, but additional data in individuals with low LDL-C are needed before it can be more generally recommended for LDL-C calculation.

### Modeling the effect of hyperoxia on the spin-lattice relaxation rate R1 of tissues [^7c4335b6]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Estimating Oxygen Consumption Ratefromand R t

Using the Krogh‐Erlang solution (Equation 9) also requires knowledge of the maximum tissue oxygen consumption rate, M 0. Once R t is found, we can derive M 0 from the OEF using the following logic and assumptions. It is important to note that in order for the assumptions of the following equations to be valid, M 0 must be calculated in the normoxic state (i.e. the patient is breathing air). Under this assumption, the SO 2 along the capillary can be calculated using the linear equation:Using Equation (6), which relates mean SO 2 to the OEF, we can create a linear equation of SO 2 along z, the mean SO 2 in the capillary (SO 2 cap, mean) will be equal to the linear Equation (14) at 0.5 L. Therefore, M 0 can be related to OEF using the following steps:which can be rearranged to calculate M 0 :Finally, with M 0 and R t estimated from the OEF and blood volume, the tissue PO 2 (into‐tissue axis) can be calculated. Since the PO 2 along the capillary (P cap) on air and oxygen breathing is known from Step 1, the PO 2 throughout the Krogh cylinder can be calculated for both normoxic and hyperoxic situations (shown in Supporting Information Figure S4).

### Axial convex-shaped hematoma was associated with poor curative effect of surgical treatment for traumatic posterior fossa epidural hematoma in children [^9f0f7b94]. World Journal of Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Posterior fossa epidural hematoma (PFEDH) is rare which accounts for just 4–12.9% of all EDH cases. Since its frequently subtle and nonspecific clinical presentation, CT scan has great importance for early diagnosis and treatment of PFEDH. However, indications for surgery depending on the findings of CT image are still controversial.

Methods

We retrospectively analyzed 40 pediatric cases of PFEDH. Their baseline characteristic, clinical presentation, imaging findings and outcomes were collected and analyzed. The ellipsoid volume equation X×Y×Z/2 was used to measure the hematoma volume. The Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) was used to assess the neurologic functional outcome.

Results

A total of 40 pediatric PFEH patients were included with 8 patients having poor outcome and 32 patients having a relatively good prognosis. GCS score showed a significant difference between good and poor outcome groups (p < 0.001). Y value on CT image was significantly bigger in poor outcome group than good outcome group (p < 0.01). Similar results were got in X/Z value (p < 0.05) and Y/Z value (p < 0.01) which reflected the shape of hematoma. A predictive model with Y+X/Z showed the largest area under the ROC curve with a sensitivity of 75.0% and specificity of 93.7%.

Conclusions

GCS score at admission was closely related to the prognosis of the pediatric patients with PFEDH. The morphometry of PFEDH has a crucial role in judging the prognosis. Axial convex-shaped hematoma was associated with poor curative effect of surgical treatment.

### Simple visual review of pre-to post-operative renal ultrasound images predicts pyeloplasty success equally as well as geometric measurements: a blinded comparison with a gold standard [^0780f817]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

MAG3 diuretic renal scan remains the gold standard for determination of improvement in renal drainage following pyeloplasty for ureteropelvic junction obstruction. We hypothesized that (i) a change in geometric measurements between pre-operative and post-operative renal ultrasound (RUS) images and (ii) blinded simple visual review of images both would predict pyeloplasty success.

Objective

To determine if simple visual review and/or novel geometric measurement of renal ultrasounds can detect pyeloplasty failure.

Study Design

This study was a retrospective, blinded comparison with a gold standard. Included were children aged ≤ 18 years undergoing pyeloplasty at our institution from 2009 to 2015. For each kidney, representative pre-operative and post-operative RUS images were chosen. Our standard for pyeloplasty success was improved drainage curve on MAG3 and lack of additional surgery. Measurements for collecting system circularity, roundness, and renal parenchymal to collecting system area ratio (RPCSR) were obtained by three raters (Figure), who were blinded to the outcome of the pyeloplasty. Changes in geometric measurements were analyzed as a diagnostic test for MAG3-defined pyeloplasty success using ROC curve analysis. In addition, six reviewers blinded to pyeloplasty success reviewed pre-operative and post-operative images visually for improved hydronephrosis and categorized pyeloplasty as success or failure based on simple visual review of RUS.

Results

Fifty-three repaired renal units were identified (50 children). There were five pyeloplasty failures, four of which underwent revision or nephrectomy. While all geometric measurements could discriminate pyeloplasty failure and success, the geometric measurements that discriminated best between pyeloplasty failure and success were change in collecting system roundness and change in RPCSR. Consensus opinion among six blinded reviewers using simple visual review had a sensitivity of 94% and PPV of 100% with respect to identifying pyeloplasty success (AUC 0.97 (95% CI 0.93–1.0)). This was not significantly different from AUC for change in roundness (p = 0.09) or change in RPCSR (p = 0.1).

Discussion

Change in collecting system roundness and change in RPCSR were the most accurate geometric measurements in predicting pyeloplasty success. Simple visual review of ultrasound images for pyeloplasty success performed as well or better than geometric measurements. However, geometric measurements remain useful as a research tool or to communicate findings between clinicians.

Conclusions

Complex geometric measurements of hydronephrosis or post-operative MAG3 scans are not needed if hydronephrosis is visually significantly improved, as simple visual review is highly sensitive for detecting pyeloplasty failure.

### Theoretical hydraulic consequences of vein graft taper [^e3d25f07]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

Internal diameter is a strong predictor of patency of infrainguinal vein grafts. However, most vein grafts are tapered, with variable diameter along their length. It is unknown which diameter is most important in determining graft resistive properties, that is, its mean diameter, minimum diameter, or some geometric combination thereof. The purpose of this analysis was to examine the hydraulic consequences of vein graft tapering, with longitudinal impedance (Z(L)), a conduit-specific measure of pulsatile resistance along straight rigid tubes.

Methods

Proximal and distal graft pressure, pressure gradient (DeltaP), and blood flow (Q) were measured intraoperatively in a 100 cm bypass graft and digitally recorded for 10 seconds at 200 Hz. With the Womersley solution for fully developed fluid flow in a rigid tube, a series of DeltaP waveforms were generated for graft diameters ranging from 1.2 to 8.2 mm. With an axisymmetric form of the Navier-Stokes equations, a second series of DeltaP waveforms were computed for grafts with long smooth symmetric tapers ranging from 0% to 90%, with geometric mean diameter of 3.2, 4.2, and 5.2 mm (%Taper = 100 x [proximal diameter - distal diameter]/proximal diameter). For each set of DeltaP and Q, Z(L) was calculated as DeltaP/Q, plotted over a range of 8 Hz, and integrated over 4 Hz to yield integral Z(L).

Results

The architecture of the calculated DeltaP and Z(L) waveforms closely approximated their measured counterparts, validating the method. As expected, Z(L) was highly diameter-dependent in a nonlinear fashion. With a clinically relevant boundary of less than 50 x 10(3) dyne/cm(5) as "acceptable", the minimum acceptable diameter of nontapered 100 cm bypass conduits was 4.3 mm. Analysis of graft taper revealed that small amounts of taper in large conduits were well-tolerated. For example, introduction of 32% taper in a 5.2 mm graft (6.2 mm → 4.2 mm) caused only an 8% increase in integral Z(L) (from 32 to 35 x 10(3) dyne/cm(5)). More pronounced taper in smaller conduits rendered them unacceptable. For example, 53% taper of a 4.2 mm graft (5.7 mm → 2.7 mm) created a conduit with integral Z(L) of 70 x 10(3) dyne/cm(5), well above the acceptable limit. The relationship between Z(L) and percent taper was nonlinear and strongly dependent on mean diameter.

Conclusions

The relationship between Z(L) and diameter in vein grafts is nonlinear; thus Z(L) increases rapidly in conduits smaller than 4 mm. Tapered vein grafts behave hydraulically like nontapered grafts, provided their geometric mean is greater than 4 mm and their degree of taper is less than 40%. Tapered veins are satisfactory conduits for long-segment bypass grafts, provided their mean diameter is acceptable.

### A probabilistic model for the MRMC method, part 1: theoretical development [^4e751f00]. Academic Radiology (2006). Low credibility.

Rationale and Objectives

Current approaches to receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis use the MRMC (multiple-reader, multiple-case) paradigm in which several readers read each case and their ratings (or scores) are used to construct an estimate of the area under the ROC curve or some other ROC-related parameter. Standard practice is to decompose the parameter of interest according to a linear model into terms that depend in various ways on the readers, cases, and modalities. Though the methodologic aspects of MRMC analysis have been studied in detail, the literature on the probabilistic basis of the individual terms is sparse. In particular, few articles state what probability law applies to each term and what underlying assumptions are needed for the assumed independence. When probability distributions are specified for these terms, these distributions are assumed to be Gaussians.

Materials and Methods

This article approaches the MRMC problem from a mechanistic perspective. For a single modality, three sources of randomness are included: the images, the reader skill, and the reader uncertainty. The probability law on the reader scores is written in terms of three nested conditional probabilities, and random variables associated with this probability are referred to as triply stochastic.

Results

In this article, we present the probabilistic MRMC model and apply this model to the Wilcoxon statistic. The result is a seven-term expansion for the variance of the figure of merit.

Conclusion

We relate the terms in this expansion to those in the standard, linear MRMC model. Finally, we use the probabilistic model to derive constraints on the coefficients in the seven-term expansion.

### Theory of branching morphogenesis by local interactions and global guidance [^28dd9ce7]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Signatures of external guidance on the morphology of branched networks

To go further and test the predicted signatures of external guidance on branch orientations, we next analyzed the distribution of branch angles in the data. As predicted by Eq. (2), we expected the distribution of the angle difference ψ (see Fig. 3 a for a schematic) to decay with a variance scaling as D / μ f c (see Fig. 3 b-d for the distributions P (ψ) obtained from simulations and analytical theory). Comparing theory and experimental data revealed very good agreement, with both single neuron distributions (see Supplementary Fig. 13 for the individual distributions) and distributions averaged across all data (Fig. 3 e) closely following the predicted scaling of the von Mises distribution. Importantly, the single free parameter in this fit (i.e. the variance of the distribution) allows us to estimate μ f c / D, and thus the relative strength of the global/extrinsic guidance compared with local stochasticity (see Supplementary Note 3 and Supplementary Table 1 for details on the measurements and values of the other parameters, in particular the estimation of the branching probability and branch length). Interestingly, we find intermediate values of D / μ f c ≃ 0.35, arguing that neuronal morphology is shaped by a combination of both factors.

### How dieting might make some fatter: modeling weight cycling toward obesity from a perspective of body composition autoregulation [^32b99e3d]. International Journal of Obesity (2020). Medium credibility.

Two exponential fits are shown: a generalized linear model (GLM) with 95% confidence intervals (solid line), and a linear model (LM), with R 2 values (dotted line). The four figures correspond to the four methods presented in the main text for computing the value FAT END at the final time END at which the subjects would have completely recovered their initial FFM. The two red squares correspond to the US Army Ranger data points presented in the section on 'Applications of the Model'.

Their exact values depend on the method used for computing the values FAT END when the FFM has been completely recovered and on the type of statistical regression used. As explained previously, we consider four methods for computing FAT END. In Fig. 4, we show the fits obtained from a generalized linear model (GLM) with 95% confidence intervals (solid line) and from a linear model (LM), with R 2 values (dotted line). Following the performance of diagnostics tests to analyze the residuals, it is found that the GLM satisfies the major assumptions of regression analysis better than the LM, especially concerning the normality assumption of the error terms. Nevertheless, as shown in Fig. 4, both models give curves that are close to each other. In simple terms, the main difference between the above LM and GLM approaches to estimate the best parameter values for the constants a and b is the way the error term is handled. In the LM method, we write y = a × e bx × ε, where ε is a random error variable that follows a log-normal distribution with parameters μ = 0 and σ 2. Taking the logarithm on both sides of the equality gives, which corresponds to the linear model, where, x ′ = x, β 1 = b andis a random error variable that follows a normal distribution with mean μ = 0 and variance σ 2. Note that in the LM method, the error term ε is multiplied with the exponential function y = a × e bx. In the GLM method, the error term is instead added to the exponential function. Formally, we write y = a ×e bx + ε, where ε is a random error variable that follows a normal distribution with mean 0 and variance σ 2. As a consequence, the GLM admits the possibility of the value y = 0 (which is excluded in LM) and assumes that the variance V (y) is constant, while the LM method assumes that V (y) varies with x. Finally, note that the LM method admits exact analytical solutions for the model parameters a and b, while the GLM method requires numerical optimization algorithms to find the best values (the maximum likelihood estimates) for a and b.

### A space-time tradeoff for implementing a function with master equation dynamics [^a86ddc02]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Many problems in science and engineering involve understanding how a physical system can implement a given map taking its initial, "input" state to its "output" state at some later time. Often such a map is represented by some stochastic matrix P. For example, P may be a conditional distribution that governs the evolution of some naturally occurring system between two particular moments, and we wish to understand what underlying physical process could result in that conditional distribution. Alternatively, P might represent some function f that we wish to implement using a physical process, e.g. f could be the update function of the logical state of a digital computer.

In this paper we uncover constraints on the amounts of various resources that are needed by any system that implements a stochastic matrix P. Throughout, we suppose that the underlying dynamics of the system are continuous-time and Markovian. (Such systems are sometimes said to evolve according to a "master equation".) This basic assumption underlies many analyses in stochastic thermodynamics –, and applies to many classical physical systems at the mesoscale, as well as semiclassical approximations of open quantum system with discrete states. Master equations also frequently appear in biology, demography, chemistry, computer science, and various other scientific fields. In addition to assuming master equation dynamics, we focus on the case where P represents some single-valued functionover a finite space of "visible states". For example, this would be the case for any physical system that implements an idealized digital device.

### Dependence of the shape of graphene nanobubbles on trapped substance [^5cfcf22c]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Results

van der Waals pressure

The size of a bubble depends on the number of trapped atoms/molecules and the induced hydrostatic pressure inside the bubble is determined by the adhesion forces between the layers forming the bubble. Using membrane theory for round shape bubbles, the hydrostatic pressure and adhesion energy of the graphene bubbles are respectively given by:

where Y, h max and R are, respectively, the Young's modulus of graphene (340 N m −1), the height, and radius of the bubble. For h max ∼1 nm this results into P hyd ≈1.6 GPa (Γ∼1 N m −1) and 100 MPa (Γ = 0.1 N m −1) for bubbles with radii R = 5 nm and R = 10 nm, respectively. The obtained adhesion energy for larger bubbles are in agreement with previous first-principles calculationsand our semi-empirical calculations. In fact, the notable elastic properties of monolayer graphene and the strong interfacial adhesion between graphene and the substrate causes the intercalated atoms to be squeezed into extremely small volumes (R ∼1–10 nm) where they can experience a pressure of the order of GPa. Furthermore, nonlinear plate theory modifies equation (1) as follows:

The second terms in equation (2) are the contributions of bending energy where κ ≅0.24 nN-nm is the bending stiffness of graphene. For h max ∼1 nm this gives P ∼1.42 GPa (Γ = 0.56 N m −1) and 89 MPa (Γ = 0.035 N m −1) for R = 5 nm and R = 10 nm, respectively. It is seen that by including the second terms, pressure decreases with ∼10% and the adhesion energy with 50–80%. Notice that in equations (1) and (2) both Y and κ varies slightly with temperature. It is important to note that for larger h max / R the contribution of the second terms in equation (2) become more important — see Supplementary Note 1.

In common MDs simulations, the pressure is calculated using the virial method which requires a homogeneous system:

### A first-principle mechanism for particulate aggregation and self-assembly in stratified fluids [^e38ebdb3]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Next, for general Peclet numbers, we utilize the finite element package COMSOL to calculate steady solutions of these equations of motion. See Supplementary Notes 1 and 2, Supplementary Table 1, and Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2 for extended details on this calculation.

Figure 3 depicts the simulations for this method, documenting the toroidal flow structures observed for a range of Peclet numbers. In the top left panel, we document, for the case of a sphere, the maximum flow speed in the equatorial plane as well as the maximum speed overall in the entire domain as a function of the Peclet number. In the equatorial plane, there is an optimal velocity which occurs at a Peclet number slightly bigger than unity. As a benchmark, observe that the slope (here in log-log coordinates) at low Peclet number is(i.e.), which is the exact theoretical scaling in this limit. In the lower left panels, the companion flow structures are observed for four representative Peclet numbers. The background color scheme is assigned by the radial velocity, with negative values corresponding to horizontal velocities directed left. Observe that in all cases, in the equatorial plane, the velocities are directed to attract nearby fluid particles towards the sphere. In the right panels of Fig. 3 we show the analogous plots for spheroids of different aspect ratios. In the top, we show the max speed in the equatorial plane and global max speed as a function of aspect ratio, whereas in the bottom, we document the toroidal flow structures for four representative aspect ratios. In all cases, we observe a monotonic increase in the max equatorial speed as the horizontal disc radius increases.

### Estradiol (menostar) [^ab10c953]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Absorption

The bioavailability of estradiol following application of a Menostar transdermal system, relative to that of a transdermal system delivering 25 mcg per day, was investigated in 18 healthy postmenopausal women, mean age 66 years (range 60 to 80 years). The mean serum estradiol concentrations upon administration of the two patches to the lower abdomen are shown in Figure 1. Transdermal administration of Menostar produced geometric mean serum concentration (Cavg) of estradiol of 13.7 pg/mL. No patches failed to adhere during the one week application period of both transdermal systems. Following application of the Menostar transdermal system to the abdomen, it is estimated to provide an average nominal in-vivo daily delivery of 14 mcg estradiol per day.

The Menostar transdermal delivery system continuously releases estradiol which is transported across intact skin leading to sustained circulating levels of estradiol during a 7-day treatment period. The systemic availability of estradiol after transdermal administration is about 20 times higher than that after oral administration. This difference is due to the absence of first pass metabolism when estradiol is given by the transdermal route.

Table 2 provides a summary of estradiol pharmacokinetic parameters determined during evaluation of the Menostar transdermal system using baseline uncorrected serum concentrations.

Pharmacokinetic parameters are expressed in geometric means except for the Tmaxwhich represents the median estimate and the Cminwhich is expressed as the arithmetic mean. The estimated estradiol daily delivery rate for Climara 6.5 cm2is quoted from the Climara labeling.

Distribution

The distribution of exogenous estrogens is similar to that of endogenous estrogens. Estrogens are widely distributed in the body and are generally found in higher concentrations in the sex hormone target organs. Estrogens circulate in the blood largely bound to SHBG and albumin. In the clinical study with 208 patients on Menostar, SHBG concentration (mean ± SD) remained essentially unchanged over the 2 year period (baseline 45.1 ± 20.1 nmol/L, 24-month visit 46.4 ± 20.9 nmol/L).

### A DNA-based system for selecting and displaying the combined result of two input variables [^afa284ca]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

Oligonucleotide-based technologies for biosensing or bio-regulation produce huge amounts of rich high-dimensional information. There is a consequent need for flexible means to combine diverse pieces of such information to form useful derivative outputs, and to display those immediately. Here we demonstrate this capability in a DNA-based system that takes two input numbers, represented in DNA strands, and returns the result of their multiplication, writing this as a number in a display. Unlike a conventional calculator, this system operates by selecting the result from a library of solutions rather than through logic operations. The multiplicative example demonstrated here illustrates a much more general capability — to generate a unique output for any distinct pair of DNA inputs. The system thereby functions as a lookup table and could be a key component in future, more powerful data-processing systems for diagnostics and sensing.

Blood pressure thresholds and recommendations for treatment and follow-up — The algorithm categorizes normal BP, elevated BP, stage 1 hypertension, and stage 2 hypertension with associated actions and reassessment intervals. Normal BP (< 120/80 mm Hg) receives lifestyle therapy with reassess in 1 y, while elevated BP (120–129/ < 80 mm Hg) receives lifestyle therapy with reassess in 3–6 mo. Stage 1 Hypertension (130–139/80–89 mm Hg) begins with lifestyle therapy and reassess in 3–6 mo, then proceeds to the decision nodes "Stage 1 Hypertension? (130–139/80–89 mm Hg)" and "DM, CKD or increased short-term risk of CVD (10-year PREVENT risk ≥ 7.5%)?"; if yes, the pathway specifies BP-lowering medication AND reassess in 1 mo, followed by "BP goal met?" with "YES" leading to reassess in 3–6 mo and "NO" prompting to consider intensification of therapy while optimizing adherence. Stage 2 Hypertension (≥ 140/90 mm Hg) is displayed with lifestyle therapy, a left-hand directive states "Promote Lifestyle Therapy at All Thresholds", and the legend lists recommendation categories COR 1, COR 2a, COR 2b, COR 3: No Benefit, and COR 3: Harm; the figure notes it is "Based on the PREVENT calculator".

### Estimation in medical imaging without a gold standard [^82dda7fe]. Academic Radiology (2002). Low credibility.

Rationale and Objectives

In medical imaging, physicians often estimate a parameter of interest (eg, cardiac ejection fraction) for a patient to assist in establishing a diagnosis. Many different estimation methods may exist, but rarely can one be considered a gold standard. Therefore, evaluation and comparison of different estimation methods are difficult. The purpose of this study was to examine a method of evaluating different estimation methods without use of a gold standard.

Materials and Methods

This method is equivalent to fitting regression lines without the x axis. To use this method, multiple estimates of the clinical parameter of interest for each patient of a given population were needed. The authors assumed the statistical distribution for the true values of the clinical parameter of interest was a member of a given family of parameterized distributions. Furthermore, they assumed a statistical model relating the clinical parameter to the estimates of its value. Using these assumptions and observed data, they estimated the model parameters and the parameters characterizing the distribution of the clinical parameter.

Results

The authors applied the method to simulated cardiac ejection fraction data with varying numbers of patients, numbers of modalities, and levels of noise. They also tested the method on both linear and nonlinear models and characterized the performance of this method compared to that of conventional regression analysis by using x-axis information. Results indicate that the method follows trends similar to that of conventional regression analysis as patients and noise vary, although conventional regression analysis outperforms the method presented because it uses the gold standard which the authors assume is unavailable.

Conclusion

The method accurately estimates model parameters. These estimates can be used to rank the systems for a given estimation task.
