## Question

why blood pressure check at home is recommended?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking why blood pressure checks at home are recommended. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the limitations of office blood pressure and why out-of-office measurement is needed. Then, I should verify the diagnostic advantages of home blood pressure monitoring, including white-coat and masked hypertension. Next, I will examine prognostic value and how home readings relate to cardiovascular outcomes. After that, I need to check the evidence for improved blood pressure control and adherence. I will then review practical, cost, and implementation considerations. Finally, I should confirm guideline positions and synthesize a concise, clinically grounded conclusion with appropriate thresholds and protocols.

> Let me first confirm the core problem with office-only blood pressure. Office measurements are susceptible to the white-coat effect, measurement error, and limited reproducibility, which can lead to misclassification and inappropriate treatment decisions; this is precisely why major guidelines recommend confirming elevated office readings with out-of-office measurements before labeling hypertension or initiating therapy [^111iQm4V] [^115S7VE1] [^111qcnuX].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic advantages of home blood pressure monitoring. HBPM provides multiple readings over several days in the patient's usual environment, which improves reproducibility and correlates more closely with ambulatory blood pressure than isolated office readings; importantly, HBPM helps identify white-coat hypertension and masked hypertension, phenotypes with distinct cardiovascular risks that are often missed by office-only strategies [^1131UFhG] [^111ZaodB] [^117L3HHa].

> I should confirm the prognostic value next. Home blood pressure consistently predicts cardiovascular events, stroke, and mortality better than office blood pressure, and this association persists even after adjusting for office values; this stronger prognostic linkage underpins the preference for out-of-office measurements in risk stratification and treatment decisions [^113pGjBt] [^112hQZan] [^1131UFhG].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about clinical impact without checking control outcomes. Meta-analyses and randomized trials show that HBPM, especially when paired with co-interventions like education, feedback, or medication titration, yields modest but meaningful reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure and improves the proportion of patients achieving targets; this translates into potential reductions in vascular complications at the population level [^115Rxck4] [^112G2gGH] [^117L3HHa].

> I need to ensure we address practical and cost considerations. HBPM is more accessible, less expensive, and better tolerated than ambulatory monitoring for many patients, enabling longitudinal monitoring and timely therapy adjustments; however, I should double-check that benefits depend on validated devices, correct cuff sizing, and standardized patient training, which are frequent implementation gaps in real-world practice [^114zu4rH] [^116ui8Uo] [^1128vUB5].

> Next, I should review guideline positions to anchor the strength of recommendation. The USPSTF recommends ABPM as the reference standard for confirming hypertension but accepts HBPM as an alternative when ABPM is unavailable or impractical; the VA/DoD guideline explicitly recommends HBPM to confirm diagnosis and for ongoing management, and the 2023 ESH guideline endorses HBPM for both diagnostic confirmation and long-term follow-up to improve control, particularly when combined with education and asynchronous data transfer [^111iQm4V] [^112EPBRi] [^111BBJ8f] [^115ssfZJ].

> Let me think about thresholds and protocols, and I should verify consistency. Most contemporary guidance aligns diagnostic hypertension at home with a threshold of 135/85 mmHg, which corresponds to 140/90 mmHg in the office; for treatment targets, many guidelines now recommend < 130/80 mmHg in high-risk patients, and optimal HBPM schedules generally involve duplicate morning and evening measurements for 3–7 days, discarding the first day and averaging the remainder, with validated upper-arm devices and appropriate cuff sizing [^114XfKhy] [^115uXMAo] [^111BBJ8f] [^116ui8Uo].

> But wait, what if the patient has special populations or settings in mind. I should confirm that HBPM is endorsed across diverse contexts, including diabetes, chronic kidney disease, pregnancy, and older adults, with the caveat that device validation and cuff selection must match the population; in pediatrics, HBPM is feasible but not yet validated for diagnosis, so it should be used adjunctively rather than as a standalone diagnostic tool [^1176WL2r] [^1127239Y] [^113th9Qp] [^116BGEBs].

> I will now examine implementation barriers and how to mitigate them. Real-world uptake is hindered by lack of validated devices, inadequate patient training, uncertain reimbursement, and clinician workflow challenges; addressing these with device validation lists, standardized protocols, education, and integration into telehealth workflows improves reliability and clinical utility, which is why recent position papers emphasize connectivity and asynchronous data sharing to close the loop on care [^112bsJEV] [^117L3HHa] [^115ssfZJ].

> Let me reconsider the overall synthesis to ensure internal consistency. Home blood pressure monitoring is recommended because it overcomes the limitations of office measurement, improves diagnostic accuracy for hypertension phenotypes, provides superior prognostic information, and — when implemented with validated devices and co-interventions — enhances blood pressure control and may reduce cardiovascular events; major guidelines converge on incorporating HBPM into routine care, making it a central pillar of modern hypertension management alongside office and ambulatory strategies [^111iQm4V] [^111BBJ8f] [^117L3HHa].

Home blood pressure monitoring is recommended because it provides **more accurate, reproducible, and prognostically meaningful** readings than office measurements, enabling detection of white-coat and masked hypertension and improving long-term blood pressure control [^1131UFhG] [^117L3HHa]. HBPM is **endorsed by major guidelines** for diagnosis confirmation, treatment monitoring, and ongoing care, especially when combined with education and clinician feedback [^111iQm4V] [^111BBJ8f] [^113jvVC1]. It is practical, cost-effective, and empowers patients, but requires validated devices, proper technique, and structured protocols to be effective [^114zu4rH] [^116ui8Uo] [^115uXMAo].

---

## Diagnostic accuracy and clinical utility

- **White-coat and masked hypertension**: HBPM detects white-coat (elevated office, normal home) and masked hypertension (normal office, elevated home), which are missed by office readings and carry distinct cardiovascular risks [^1131UFhG] [^117L3HHa].

- **Reproducibility and reliability**: Home readings are more reproducible than office measurements due to multiple readings in a familiar setting, reducing variability and misclassification [^117Q2awB] [^111ZaodB].

- **Prognostic value**: Home BP correlates more strongly with cardiovascular outcomes than office BP, providing better risk stratification and guiding therapy [^113pGjBt] [^112hQZan].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

| **Guideline/source** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| USPSTF (2021) | Confirm elevated office BP with HBPM or ABPM before treatment; HBPM is an acceptable alternative when ABPM is unavailable [^111iQm4V] [^115S7VE1] |
| VA/DoD (2020) | Strongly recommend HBPM to confirm diagnosis and for ongoing management, especially with co-interventions [^112EPBRi] [^112G2gGH] |
| ESH (2023) | Recommend HBPM for diagnosis, treatment monitoring, and long-term follow-up to improve control [^111BBJ8f] [^113jvVC1] |
| ESC (2024) | Emphasize HBPM to improve BP control and support telemedicine integration [^117Hefhe] [^116YbHH7] |

---

## Benefits of home blood pressure monitoring

- **Improved BP control**: HBPM improves control and increases the proportion achieving targets, particularly when paired with education or medication titration [^115Rxck4] [^112G2gGH].

- **Patient engagement**: Self-monitoring empowers patients, enhances adherence, and supports lifestyle change [^117L3HHa] [^115Fo1K2].

- **Cost-effectiveness**: HBPM reduces healthcare utilization and is more affordable than ABPM for longitudinal monitoring [^114zu4rH] [^117L3HHa].

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **Device validation**: Only validated upper-arm cuffs should be used; many consumer devices lack proven accuracy [^116ui8Uo] [^112bsJEV].

- **Patient training**: Proper technique and adherence to standardized protocols are essential for reliable data [^115uXMAo] [^115GaZiw].

- **Interpretation**: Clinicians must integrate home readings with clinical context and, when uncertain, use ABPM to resolve discrepancies [^111ZaodB] [^112zq7fH].

---

## Practical implementation

- **Protocol**: Measure twice in the morning and twice in the evening for 3–7 days, discard day 1, and average the rest; use validated devices and correct cuff size [^115uXMAo] [^111BBJ8f].

- **Thresholds**: Home BP ≥ 135/85 mmHg corresponds to office ≥ 140/90 mmHg; < 130/80 mmHg is a common treatment target in high-risk patients [^114XfKhy] [^117TK6Qp].

- **Integration**: Share readings via telehealth or written logs to guide therapy adjustments and follow-up [^115ssfZJ] [^115uXMAo].

---

Home blood pressure monitoring is recommended because it **improves diagnostic accuracy**, detects clinically important hypertension phenotypes, and enhances control when implemented with validated devices and clinician support. It is a **cornerstone of modern hypertension care** that aligns with guideline-based, patient-centered practice.

Home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM) overcomes many of the limitations of traditional office blood pressure (BP) measurement and is both cheaper and easier to perform than ambulatory BP monitoring. Monitors that use the oscillometric method are currently available that are accurate, reliable, easy to use, and relatively inexpensive. An increasing number of patients are using them regularly to check their BP at home, but although this has been endorsed by national and international guidelines, detailed recommendations for their use have been lacking. There is a rapidly growing literature showing that measurements taken by patients at home are often lower than readings taken in the office and closer to the average BP recorded by 24-hour ambulatory monitors, which is the BP that best predicts cardiovascular risk. Because of the larger numbers of readings that can be taken by HBPM than in the office and the elimination of the white-coat effect (the increase of BP during an office visit), home readings are more reproducible than office readings and show better correlations with measures of target organ damage. In addition, prospective studies that have used multiple home readings to express the true BP have found that home BP predicts risk better than office BP (Class IIa; Level of Evidence A). This call-to-action article makes the following recommendations: (1) It is recommended that HBPM should become a routine component of BP measurement in the majority of patients with known or suspected hypertension; (2) Patients should be advised to purchase oscillometric monitors that measure BP on the upper arm with an appropriate cuff size and that have been shown to be accurate according to standard international protocols. They should be shown how to use them by their healthcare providers; (3) Two to 3 readings should be taken while the subject is resting in the seated position, both in the morning and at night, over a period of 1 week. A total of ≥ 12 readings are recommended for making clinical decisions; (4) HBPM is indicated in patients with newly diagnosed or suspected hypertension, in whom it may distinguish between white-coat and sustained hypertension. If the results are equivocal, ambulatory BP monitoring may help to establish the diagnosis; (5) In patients with prehypertension, HBPM may be useful for detecting masked hypertension; (6) HBPM is recommended for evaluating the response to any type of antihypertensive treatment and may improve adherence; (7) The target HBPM goal for treatment is < 135/85 mm Hg or < 130/80 mm Hg in high-risk patients; (8) HBPM is useful in the elderly, in whom both BP variability and the white-coat effect are increased; (9) HBPM is of value in patients with diabetes, in whom tight BP control is of paramount importance; (10) Other populations in whom HBPM may be beneficial include pregnant women, children, and patients with kidney disease; and (11) HBPM has the potential to improve the quality of care while reducing costs and should be reimbursed.

### How often should self-monitoring of blood pressure be repeated? A secondary analysis of data from two randomized controlled trials [^113V6wtT]. Journal of Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

Comparison to the literature

There has been widespread support for many years for more standardized, evidence-based implementation of self-monitoring of BP. Whilst ambulatory BP monitoring remains the gold standard, its main role is in diagnosis and for those with difficult to control hypertension, due to logistical and practical issues in repeating such measurements frequently. Self-monitoring of BP has been shown to produce results that correlate strongly with ambulatory readings, provided suitable schedules are used, and therefore can be used with confidence for routine monitoring. A survey of 341 UK GPs explored self-monitoring of BP implementation in day-to-day clinical practice, with results ranging from 24% using monthly readings, 34% bi-annual readings and 6% requesting annual readings from patients, demonstrating broad variations between professionals. NICE recommends an "annual review of care for adults with hypertension", but does not comment specifically on how frequently self-monitoring of BP checks should be undertaken. The European Society of Hypertension guidelines from 2010 for home blood pressure monitoring recommend that treated hypertensive patients should perform regular home BP measurements, for example, once or twice a week, whereas the 2018 guidelines recommend that once target BP has been reached, an "interval of a few months is reasonable" between hypertension reviews. It is acknowledged that this is an area of debate, which partly justifies these differences, as well as commenting that the higher frequency recommended in 2010 had the additional aim of reinforcing patient compliance with medications. In contrast, other resources from NHS England allude to the benefits of "regular home blood pressure monitoring" in their strategy for cardiovascular disease prevention in primary care. This highlights the lack of consistency across different sources, which maybe partly fuelled by the limited evidence available to date.

### European Society of Hypertension practice guidelines for home blood pressure monitoring [^112Rx153]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2010). Low credibility.

Self-monitoring of blood pressure by patients at home (home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM)) is being increasingly used in many countries and is well accepted by hypertensive patients. Current hypertension guidelines have endorsed the use of HBPM in clinical practice as a useful adjunct to conventional office measurements. Recently, a detailed consensus document on HBPM was published by the European Society of Hypertension Working Group on Blood Pressure Monitoring. However, in daily practice, briefer documents summarizing the essential recommendations are needed. It is also accepted that the successful implementation of clinical guidelines in routine patient care is dependent on their acceptance by involvement of practising physicians. The present document, which provides concise and updated guidelines on the use of HBPM for practising physicians, was therefore prepared by including the comments and feedback of general practitioners.

### Screening for hypertension in adults: US preventive services task force reaffirmation recommendation statement [^111iQm4V]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Clinician summary: Screening for hypertension in adults — "Screen adults for hypertension. Grade A" applies to "Adults 18 years or older without known hypertension". This recommendation is consistent with the 2015 USPSTF recommendation. Measure blood pressure with an office blood pressure measurement. Take blood pressure measurements outside of the clinical setting to confirm a hypertension diagnosis before starting treatment. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring: patients wear a programmed portable device that automatically takes blood pressure measurements, typically in 20- to 30-minute intervals over 12 to 24 hours while patients go about their normal activities or are sleeping. Home blood pressure monitoring: patients measure their own blood pressure at home with an automated device. Measurements are taken much less frequently than with ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (eg, 1 to 2 times a day or week, although they can be spread out over more time). Blood pressure measurements should be taken at the brachial artery (upper arm) with a validated and accurate device in a seated position after 5 minutes of rest. Reasonable options include "Screening for hypertension every year in adults 40 years or older and in adults at increased risk for hypertension (such as Black persons, persons with high-normal blood pressure, or persons who are overweight or obese)". Reasonable options also include "Screening less frequently (ie, every 3–5 years) as appropriate for adults aged 18 to 39 years not at increased risk for hypertension and with a prior normal blood pressure reading".

### Predictors of the home-clinic blood pressure difference: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115E93yv]. American Journal of Hypertension (2016). Low credibility.

Hypertension is an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease, the major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Effective diagnosis and management of hypertension depends on accurate measurement of blood pressure, which allows appropriate targeting of antihypertensive treatment. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) is considered to be the "gold standard" measure of blood pressure, because multiple readings are taken and because it is associated with a range of cardiovascular outcomes and end organ damage. Ambulatory blood pressure is usually lower than clinic blood pressuredue to the white coat effect (Table 1), and as such, clinical guidelines recommend that ABPM (or home) blood pressure targets are 5mm Hg lower than the corresponding clinic values. However, this "home-clinic blood pressure difference" is not always consistent. In some patients, blood pressures measured at home or with ABPM are higher than would be expected for the corresponding clinic blood pressure, the so-called masked effect (Table 1). Such patients are likely to be undertreated and have increased target organ damage, with subsequent increased cardiovascular mortality compared to normotensive patients.

Table 1.
Definitions of the home-clinic blood pressure difference

Clinic blood pressure monitoring is still recommended for initial screening of blood pressure in routine clinical practice, and thus, identifying those patients most likely to display a white coat or masked effect is important to avoid misdiagnosis and mismanagement of hypertension. There is a large body of literature proposing factors that predict white coat or masked hypertension, but no studies have systematically reviewed the evidence. Consequently there is little consensus as to which factors are most important or how they should be used in clinical practice to guide diagnosis and management decisions. The present study aimed to systematically review the literature and establish the most important predictors of a significant home-clinic blood pressure difference to inform interventions that might identify those with discordant clinic and ambulatory blood pressure in routine clinical practice.

### The optimal schedule for self-monitoring of blood pressure by patients at home [^115dEj9S]. Journal of Hypertension (2007). Low credibility.

The optimal schedule for home blood pressure monitoring should represent the usual level of home blood pressure, give a reproducible value, and have prognostic ability. Therefore, outcome studies, as well as short-term trials assessing the reproducibility of home blood pressure, its stability over time and its relationship with ambulatory blood pressure should be taken into account. A review of this evidence suggests that the optimal schedule should be based on 12–14 measurements, and even more measurements up to 25 are desirable. Morning and evening measurements should be obtained, with at least duplicate measurements per occasion. Measurements on the initial day should preferably be discarded.

### Home blood pressure monitoring [^117Vf4FG]. American Family Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

Home blood pressure monitoring provides important diagnostic information beyond in-office blood pressure readings and offers similar results to ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. Home blood pressure monitoring involves patients independently measuring their blood pressure with an electronic device, whereas ambulatory blood pressure monitoring involves patients wearing a portable monitor for 24 to 48 hours. Although ambulatory blood pressure monitoring is the diagnostic standard for measurement, home blood pressure monitoring is more practical and accessible to patients, and its use is recommended by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force and the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association. Home blood pressure monitoring generally results in lower blood pressure readings than in-office measurements, can confirm the diagnosis of hypertension after an elevated office blood pressure reading, and can identify patients with white coat hypertension or masked hypertension. Best practices for home blood pressure monitoring include using an appropriately fitting upper-arm cuff on a bare arm, emptying the bladder, avoiding caffeinated beverages for 30 minutes before taking the measurement, resting for five minutes before taking the measurement, keeping the feet on the floor uncrossed and the arm supported with the cuff at heart level, and not talking during the reading. An average of multiple readings, ideally two readings in the morning and again in the evening separated by at least one minute each, is recommended for one week. Home blood pressure readings can be used in hypertension quality measures.

See the Figure for a more detailed summary of the recommendations for clinicians. USPSTF indicates US Preventive Services Task Force. USPSTF indicates US Preventive Services Task Force. Initial 1-time screening with office blood pressure measurement has adequate specificity but low sensitivity for detecting hypertension. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that an initial positive screening result can be confirmed by home-based blood pressure measurement or ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. Quiz Ref IDInitial screening for hypertension should be performed with office blood pressure measurement. Office blood pressure measurement is most commonly performed using a manual or automated sphygmomanometer. 8, 9 Various OBPM protocols are available; however, in the studies reviewed by the USPSTF, OBPM was measured at the brachial artery with the patient most commonly in a seated position after 5 minutes of rest and medical personnel present during measurement.

8, 9Quiz Ref ID Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring and home blood pressure monitoring with validated and accurate devices should be used outside of a clinical setting to confirm a diagnosis of hypertension before starting treatment. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring offers the most evidence-based risk information for future cardiovascular events. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring devices are small portable machines that record blood pressure noninvasively at typically 20- to 30-minute intervals over 12 to 24 hours while patients go about their normal activities or are sleeping. Home blood pressure monitoring devices are fully automated oscillometer devices that record measurements taken from the patient's brachial artery.

Home blood pressure monitoring devices are activated by patients or caregivers and measurements are taken much less frequently than with ABPM.

### Japanese society of hypertension (JSH) guidelines for self-monitoring of blood pressure at home [^116hycER]. Hypertension Research (2003). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Home blood pressure (BP) measurements are indispensable for the improvement of hypertension management in medical practice as well as for the recognition of hypertension in the population. The Working Group for Establishment of Guidelines for Measurement Procedures of Self-Monitoring of Blood Pressure at Home of the Japanese Society of Hypertension has established standards for all techniques and procedures of home BP measurements. The recommendations are as follows.

Recommendation

1) Arm-cuff devices based on the cuff-oscillometric method that have been validated officially, and the accuracy of which has been confirmed in each individual, should be used for home BP measurement. 2) The BP should be measured at the upper arm. Finger-cuff devices and wrist-cuff devices should not be used for home BP measurements. 3) Devices for home BP measurement should be adapted to the American Association for Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) standards and the British Hypertension Society (BHS) guidelines. In addition, the difference between the BP measured by the auscultatory method and that measured using the device should be within 5 mmHg in each individual. The home measurement device should be validated before use, and at regular intervals during use. 4) Home BP should be monitored under the following conditions. The morning measurement should be made within 1 h after waking, after micturition, sitting after 1 to 2 min of rest, before drug ingestion, and before breakfast. The evening measurement should be made just before going to bed, sitting after 1 to 2 min of rest. 5) Home BP should be measured at least once in the morning and once in the evening. 6) All home BP measurements should be documented without selection, together with the date, time, and pulse rate. Use of devices with a printer or an integrated circuit memory is useful to avoid selection bias. 7) The home BP in the morning and that in the evening should be averaged separately for a certain period. The first measurement on each occasion should be used for totaling. 8) Home BP values averaged for a certain period indicate hypertension when 135/80 mmHg and over and definite hypertension when 135/85 mmHg and over. Normotension is defined as less than 125/80 mmHg and definite normotension as less than 125/75 mmHg. Home BP measurements based on these guidelines can be considered an appropriate tool for clinical decision-making, and it is hoped that these guidelines will serve to reduce confusion and confirm the place of home BP measurement in clinical practice.

### Expert panel consensus recommendations for home blood pressure monitoring in Asia: the hope Asia network [^112cgPSp]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2018). Low credibility.

Hypertension is the leading cause of mortality throughout Asia. Home blood pressure monitoring has the potential to improve hypertension control and is a useful adjunct to conventional office blood pressure measurements due to its diagnostic accuracy and prognostic value in predicting cardiovascular outcomes. At present, there are no region-specific guidelines addressing the use of home blood pressure monitoring in Asia. Therefore, an expert panel was convened to address the use of home blood pressure monitoring and develop key recommendations to help guide clinical practice throughout the Asia region. The resulting recommendations support the use of home blood pressure monitoring with a validated device as an accurate adjunct for diagnosing hypertension and predicting cardiovascular outcome. Diagnosis and treatment of hypertension should still be guided by conventional office/clinic blood pressure measurements. The expert panel encourages the incorporation of home blood pressure monitoring into local clinical guidelines and offers practical recommendations to ensure continuity of care where a validated home blood pressure device is not available.

### Home blood pressure monitoring: current status and new developments [^114zu4rH]. American Journal of Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

HISTORY AND GUIDELINES

Home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM) uses similar technology to ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM), but allows patients to perform their own blood pressure (BP) measurements at a time and frequency that suits them. HBPM provides information on BP at specific times and under everyday conditions over long time periods. Key advantages of HBPM include its relatively widespread availability, the ability to take multiple daily readings over a long period of time, avoidance of white-coat reactions, the ability to detect masked hypertension and BP variability, improved management of hypertension due to immediate feedback and patient involvement in their healthcare, and relatively low cost. Disadvantages include the requirement for patient education and training, measurement errors, and lack of funding in some healthcare settings.

Although ABPM is the gold standard out-of-office BP measurement, HBPM is recommended as a more practical and less expensive alternative, especially for long-term monitoring of treated patients with hypertension. Recognition and use of HBPM have increased dramatically over the last 20 years. Current hypertension guideline documents make strong recommendations for the use of out-of-office BP monitoring techniques, including HBPM and ABPM, for the diagnosis of hypertension and for the monitoring and management of antihypertensive therapy (Table 1).

Table 1.
Home blood pressure monitoring recommendations in major guideline and consensus documents

Patients for whom out-of-office BP monitoring with HBPM is indicated include those with high office BP (to detect white-coat hypertension), high-normal office BP or normal office BP with hypertension-mediated organ damage or high cardiovascular (CV) risk (to detect masked hypertension), highly variable office BP or resistant hypertension, and for evaluating BP control (especially in high-risk patients). The Japanese guidelines state that where there is a discrepancy between office BP and home BP readings, a home BP-based diagnosis should take precedence.

### Blood pressure measurement: a KDOQI perspective [^113ghkYQ]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

The majority of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have elevated blood pressure (BP). In patients with CKD, hypertension is associated with increased risk for cardiovascular disease, progression of CKD, and all-cause mortality. New guidelines from the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) recommend new thresholds and targets for the diagnosis and treatment of hypertension in patients with and without CKD. A new aspect of the guidelines is the recommendation for measurement of out-of-office BP to confirm the diagnosis of hypertension and guide therapy. In this KDOQI (Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative) perspective, we review the recommendations for accurate BP measurement in the office, at home, and with ambulatory BP monitoring. Regardless of location, validated devices and appropriate cuff sizes should be used. In the clinic and at home, proper patient preparation and positioning are critical. Patients should receive information about the importance of BP measurement techniques and be encouraged to advocate for adherence to guideline recommendations. Implementing appropriate BP measurement in routine practice is feasible and should be incorporated in system-wide efforts to improve the care of patients with hypertension. Hypertension is the number 1 chronic disease risk factor in the world; BP measurements in the office, at home, and with ambulatory BP monitoring should adhere to recommendations from the AHA.

### Schedules for self-monitoring blood pressure: a systematic review [^114vfE9Q]. American Journal of Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

Hypertension is a key risk factor for cardiovascular disease, the most important cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The detection and subsequent management of hypertension requires appropriate monitoring, and self-monitoring of blood pressure (SMBP) is increasingly used for this purpose with endorsement by guidelines worldwide. Compared to office blood pressure measurement, home readings better predict end organ damage, provide a more accurate diagnosis of hypertension, and improve patient involvement in their own care.

Despite the growing popularity of SMBP, there is little agreement as to the optimal self-monitoring schedule. The Japanese Society of Hypertension guidelines recommend 2 readings on each occasion, using the mean of the 2 over 5–7 days. The European Society of Hypertension, along with the American Heart Association and the American Society of Hypertension and National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), recommend that blood pressure (BP) should be measured on at least 3–4 days and preferably on 7 consecutive days in the morning and evening, with 2 measurements per occasion taken 1–2 minutes apart. The readings taken on the first day should be discarded and then the average of the remaining readings used. There are no separate schedules recommended for ongoing management of patients with hypertension once the initial diagnosis has been made.

This study aimed to assess the evidence for these various guideline recommendations using the systematic search undertaken for the NICE (2011) Hypertension Guidelinesas a starting point, and updating and reappraising the literature.

### The recommendations of a consensus panel for the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and associated supine hypertension [^112L9Wre]. Journal of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

At-home monitoring of blood pressure and heart rate

In addition to in-clinic blood pressure monitoring, patients should be asked to check their blood pressure and heart rate at home and record the values in a diary. We recommend that patients or their caregivers check blood pressures at home in the supine position (at least 15 min after laying down at bedtime or prior to arising from bed in the morning) and after 3 min of standing (with assistance as necessary) after arising from bed in the morning. The following timings are our recommendations for at-home blood pressures and heart rate monitoring: (1) first thing in the morning before taking morning medications, (2) when a patient feels symptomatic, and (3) at bedtime for several days. We recommend that patients keep a blood pressure and heart rate diary for at least 7 days preceding a clinic visit, but after having a clinic visit patients should not need to measure blood pressure and heart rate on a continuous daily basis unless a change in therapy occurs. With any change in therapy, an additional week of blood pressure monitoring is required to determine the effectiveness of the change. (An example patient diary for blood pressure and heart rate is provided in Appendix I.)

Medication review

There are numerous medications that can diminish the normal compensatory postural increase in heart rate, (e.g. beta blockers, non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, combined beta-/alpha-blockers such as carvedilol, central alpha-2 agonists such as clonidine or guanfacine, and antiarrhythmic agents such as amiodarone).

Japan has long maintained a robust national health system with universal health coverage and accessible antihypertensive therapy. Nevertheless, population-level blood pressure (BP) control remains suboptimal. To address this public health challenge, the Japanese Society of Hypertension published the Guidelines for the Management of Elevated Blood Pressure and Hypertension 2025 (JSH2025), integrating evidence-based recommendations and practical approaches to improve hypertension care. JSH2025 introduces a dual-format structure comprising clinical question sections developed through systematic reviews and consensus-based narrative chapters. The key updates include universal BP targets of < 130/80mmHg across populations, promotion of home BP monitoring, stratified cardiovascular risk assessment, expanded guidance on digital health and behavioral interventions, and condition-specific management strategies for older adults, women, and cancer survivors. We outline the major updates and innovations in JSH2025 and show their clinical and public health implications.

Glossary of blood pressure measurement terms defines key modalities. Standardized office blood pressure is "the recommended method for measuring blood pressure in the current revised guideline", using guideline-recommended preparations. Routine office blood pressure is "measured in the provider's office" and "does not bear a reliable relationship with standardized office blood pressure". Manual blood pressure uses "a manual auscultatory blood pressure cuff, instead of an automated method". Automated office blood pressure (AOBP) is obtained in the provider's office with "an automated device that is programmed to start only after a set resting period and measured several times", with "an average reading" output and without required provider attendance. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) is obtained on "a frequent intermittent basis (i.e., 15–30 min per 24 h)" using an automated wearable device outside the office. Home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM) is "obtained at the patient's home with an automated oscillometric or manual auscultatory device, usually excluding ABPM".

### How Do home and clinic blood pressure readings compare in pregnancy? [^113th9Qp]. Hypertension (2018). Low credibility.

The importance and potential of self-monitored BP measurement has been noted in both a joint statement from the American Heart Association, American Society of Hypertension, and Preventive Cardiovascular Nurses Association and the recent European Society of Hypertension guidelines. Consequently, in some countries, SMBP during pregnancy is becoming common: a Canadian pilot survey found > 60% of women diagnosed with nonproteinuric hypertension in pregnancy were already SMBP. A subsequent survey, of Canadian obstetricians and primary care physicians, found that most used SMBP to check for WCH (where BP is higher in clinic than at home) rather than ambulatory BP monitoring.

Thresholds for SMBP in the hypertensive nonpregnant population are generally lower than when using clinic monitoring, but the clinic−home difference varies dependent on the population, and general populations have been shown to have minimal differences between home and clinic readings. Recent guidelines from the society of Obstetrician and Gynaecologists of Canada suggest a self-monitoring threshold of 135/85 mm Hg. However, there are limited data on SMBP monitoring during pregnancy to guide such recommendations. This study aimed to systematically review the available evidence for differences between self-monitored and clinic BP during pregnancy and investigate this using individual patient data (IPD) where available.

### Home blood pressure monitoring in clinical practice: a review [^112pRGFQ]. The American Journal of Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Home blood pressure monitoring is a convenient and inexpensive technique to monitor blood pressure in hypertensive patients. There are convincing data that home blood pressure monitoring is a good predictor of future cardiovascular risk, perhaps better than office blood pressure. Home blood pressure measurement can be standardized using validated instruments and systematic protocols; normative criteria have established home blood pressure > 135/85 mm Hg as hypertensive. Home blood pressure monitoring has been shown to improve compliance and blood pressure control, and to reduce health care costs. Ongoing studies are evaluating management of hypertension based on home blood pressure readings compared with traditional office-based readings. Home blood pressure monitoring is particularly useful for evaluation of white coat hypertension and masked hypertension. In this article, we discuss the methodology for measuring blood pressure at home, its comparison to the other measurement techniques, the advantages and disadvantages, cost benefit analyses, and ongoing clinical trials to help define the role of home blood pressure monitoring in the clinical management of hypertension.

### Blood pressure control by home monitoring: meta-analysis of randomised trials [^115Rxck4]. BMJ (2004). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To determine the effect of home blood pressure monitoring on blood pressure levels and proportion of people with essential hypertension achieving targets.

Design

Meta-analysis of 18 randomised controlled trials.

Participants

1359 people with essential hypertension allocated to home blood pressure monitoring and 1355 allocated to the "control" group seen in the healthcare system for 2–36 months.

Main Outcome Measures

Differences in systolic (13 studies), diastolic (16 studies), or mean (3 studies) blood pressures, and proportion of patients achieving targets (6 studies), between intervention and control groups.

Results

Systolic blood pressure was lower in people with hypertension who had home blood pressure monitoring than in those who had standard blood pressure monitoring in the healthcare system (standardised mean difference 4.2 (95% confidence interval 1.5 to 6.9) mm Hg), diastolic blood pressure was lower by 2.4 (1.2 to 3.5) mm Hg, and mean blood pressure was lower by 4.4 (2.0 to 6.8) mm Hg. The relative risk of blood pressure above predetermined targets was lower in people with home blood pressure monitoring (risk ratio 0.90, 0.80 to 1.00). When publication bias was allowed for, the differences were attenuated: 2.2 (-0.9 to 5.3) mm Hg for systolic blood pressure and 1.9 (0.6 to 3.2) mm Hg for diastolic blood pressure.

Conclusions

Blood pressure control in people with hypertension (assessed in the clinic) and the proportion achieving targets are increased when home blood pressure monitoring is used rather than standard blood pressure monitoring in the healthcare system. The reasons for this are not clear. The difference in blood pressure control between the two methods is small but likely to contribute to an important reduction in vascular complications in the hypertensive population.

### Home blood pressure monitoring: current status and new developments [^112hQZan]. American Journal of Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

Home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM) is a reliable, convenient, and less costly alternative to ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) for the diagnosis and management of hypertension. Recognition and use of HBPM have dramatically increased over the last 20 years and current guidelines make strong recommendations for the use of both HBPM and ABPM in patients with hypertension. The accuracy and reliability of home blood pressure (BP) measurements require use of a validated device and standardized procedures, and good patient information and training. Key HBPM parameters include morning BP, evening BP, and the morning-evening difference. In addition, newer semi-automatic HBPM devices can also measure nighttime BP at fixed intervals during sleep. Advances in technology mean that HBPM devices could provide additional relevant data (e.g., environmental conditions) or determine BP in response to a specific trigger (e.g., hypoxia, increased heart rate). The value of HBPM is highlighted by a growing body of evidence showing that home BP is an important predictor of target organ damage, and cardiovascular disease (CVD)- and stroke-related morbidity and mortality, and provides better prognostic information than office BP. In addition, use of HBPM to monitor antihypertensive therapy can help to optimize reductions in BP, improve BP control, and reduce target organ damage and cardiovascular risk. Overall, HBPM should play a central role in the management of patients with hypertension, with the goal of identifying increased risk and predicting the onset of CVD events, allowing proactive interventions to reduce risk and eliminate adverse outcomes.

### Home blood pressure monitoring: Australian expert consensus statement [^115Fo1K2]. Journal of Hypertension (2015). Low credibility.

Measurement of blood pressure (BP) by a doctor in the clinic has limitations that may result in an unrepresentative measure of underlying BP which can impact on the appropriate assessment and management of high BP. Home BP monitoring is the self-measurement of BP in the home setting (usually in the morning and evening) over a defined period (e.g. 7 days) under the direction of a healthcare provider. When it may not be feasible to measure 24-h ambulatory BP, home BP may be offered as a method to diagnose and manage patients with high BP. Home BP has good reproducibility, is well tolerated, is relatively inexpensive and is superior to clinic BP for prognosis of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Home BP can be used in combination with clinic BP to identify 'white coat' and 'masked' hypertension. An average home BP of at least 135/85mmHg is an appropriate threshold for the diagnosis of hypertension. Home BP may also offer the advantage of empowering patients with their BP management, with benefits including increased adherence to therapy and lower achieved BP levels. It is recommended that, when feasible, home BP should be considered for routine use in the clinical management of hypertension.

### In-office and out-of-office blood pressure measurement [^113EbwSp]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Accurate blood pressure measurement is the key procedure for the diagnosis and treatment of hypertension. In-office and out-of-office blood pressure measurements both have advantages and weak points, and multifaceted blood pressure information in individuals should be appropriately obtained and assessed. Validation of blood pressure measurement devices has long been an important issue, and several consortiums have emerged to try address it. Clinical guidelines should meet the demands of the region in which they are applied, and out-of-office measurements have been widely stated and recommended in the recently published guidelines worldwide. Appropriate assessment of blood pressure should be performed routinely in order to provide timely and accurate evidence regarding hypertension under any situation, including an unexpected pandemic.

### How often should self-monitoring of blood pressure be repeated? A secondary analysis of data from two randomized controlled trials [^114XESug]. Journal of Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

The prevalence of co-morbidities was comparable or slightly lower in both TASMINH4 and HOMEBP than would be expected (for example, other studies report 10–20% prevalence of diabetes in the hypertensive population), potentially representing a lower baseline level of cardiovascular risk. This should be considered alongside the recommendations from this study, as those with higher cardiovascular risk may warrant more frequent monitoring to ensure aggressive BP control is achieved. Similarly, most participants took one or two antihypertensives at baseline and so these results may not hold for those with resistant hypertension.

Patients enrolled in these trials were given proper training in the use of a home blood pressure machine, and were provided with a validated device and an appropriate cuff size. This may not be representative of current general practice, where only 10% of all automated blood pressure monitors using upper arm cuffs available on the global market were validated in one Australian study. However, a recent study found that out of 331 BP monitors used by patients at home in a group of UK practices, 76% passed standard accuracy testing (measured within ± 3 mmHg to a reference monitor), rising to 95% if they were within 4 years old and previously validated. This suggests that provided patients are advised regarding appropriate monitors the current study results would apply.

### Use of different blood pressure thresholds to reduce the number of home blood pressure monitoring days needed for detecting hypertension [^116rRU34]. Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Home blood pressure (BP) monitoring over a 7-day period is recommended to confirm the diagnosis of hypertension.

Methods

We determined upper and lower home BP thresholds with > 90% positive predictive value and > 90% negative predictive value using 1 to 6 days of monitoring to identify high home BP (systolic BP ≥ 130 mmHg or diastolic BP ≥ 80 mmHg) based on 7 days of home BP monitoring. The sample included 361 adults from the Improving the Detection of Hypertension Study who were not taking antihypertensive medication. We used two 7-day periods, at least 3 days apart, the first being a sampling period and the second a reference period. For each number of days in the sampling period, we determined the percentage of participants who had a high likelihood of having (> 90% positive predictive value) or not having (> 90% negative predictive value) high BP and would not need to continue home BP monitoring. Only the participants in an uncertain category (ie, positive predictive value ≤ 90% and negative predictive value ≤ 90%) after each day were carried forward to the next day of home BP monitoring.

Results

Of the 361 participants (mean [SD] age of 41.3 [13.2] years; 60.4% women), 38.0% had high home BP during the reference period. There were 63.7%, 17.1%, 10.5%, 3.3%, 3.6%, and 1.4% participants who would not need to continue after 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 days of monitoring.

Conclusions

In most people, high home BP can be identified or excluded with a high degree of confidence with 3 days or less of monitoring.

### Relative effectiveness of clinic and home blood pressure monitoring compared with ambulatory blood pressure monitoring in diagnosis of hypertension: systematic review [^1131UFhG]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

High blood pressure is a key risk factor for the development of cardiovascular diseaseand is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Hypertension is the commonest chronic disorder seen in primary care, with around one in eight of all people receiving antihypertensive treatment.

Initial management of hypertension conventionally requires a diagnosis based on several clinic or office blood pressure measurements. National and international guidelines recommend similar strategies, although the thresholds of blood pressure for diagnosis and risk vary. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, however, estimates "true" mean blood pressure more accurately than clinic measurement because multiple readings are taken; it has also been shown to have better correlation with a range of cardiovascular outcomes and end organ damage. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring is typically used when there is uncertainty in diagnosis, resistance to treatment, irregular or diurnal variation, or concerns about variability and the "white coat" effect. It has therefore arguably become the reference standard for the diagnosis of hypertension.

Home blood pressure monitoring, which provides multiple readings over several days, is also better correlated with end organ damage than clinic measurement. It seems to be a better prognostic indicator with respect to stroke and cardiovascular mortalityand can identify white coat and masked hypertension. It could provide an appropriate alternative to ambulatory monitoring in terms of diagnosis, particularly in primary care where it might not be immediately available or deemed too costly or when patients find it inconvenient or uncomfortable. Home monitoring has a smaller evidence base than ambulatory monitoring but has gained acceptance over recent years as data accumulate and accurate equipment becomes more widely available.

If guidelines are to retain clinic measurement as a standard diagnostic tool, it is important to assess these in the light of ambulatory measurement. Similarly, for home measurements to be considered as an alternative to ambulatory measurements then their test performance needs to be evaluated. We conducted a systematic review of the test performance of the diagnosis of hypertension by clinic measurement and home monitoring compared with the reference standard of ambulatory monitoring.

### Relative effectiveness of clinic and home blood pressure monitoring compared with ambulatory blood pressure monitoring in diagnosis of hypertension: systematic review [^112zq7fH]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To determine the relative accuracy of clinic measurements and home blood pressure monitoring compared with ambulatory blood pressure monitoring as a reference standard for the diagnosis of hypertension.

Design

Systematic review with meta-analysis with hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic models. Methodological quality was appraised, including evidence of validation of blood pressure measurement equipment.

Data Sources

Medline (from 1966), Embase (from 1980), Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, DARE, Medion, ARIF, and TRIP up to May 2010. Eligibility criteria for selecting studies Eligible studies examined diagnosis of hypertension in adults of all ages using home and/or clinic blood pressure measurement compared with those made using ambulatory monitoring that clearly defined thresholds to diagnose hypertension.

Results

The 20 eligible studies used various thresholds for the diagnosis of hypertension, and only seven studies (clinic) and three studies (home) could be directly compared with ambulatory monitoring. Compared with ambulatory monitoring thresholds of 135/85 mm Hg, clinic measurements over 140/90 mm Hg had mean sensitivity and specificity of 74.6% (95% confidence interval 60.7% to 84.8%) and 74.6% (47.9% to 90.4%), respectively, whereas home measurements over 135/85 mm Hg had mean sensitivity and specificity of 85.7% (78.0% to 91.0%) and 62.4% (48.0% to 75.0%).

Conclusions

Neither clinic nor home measurement had sufficient sensitivity or specificity to be recommended as a single diagnostic test. If ambulatory monitoring is taken as the reference standard, then treatment decisions based on clinic or home blood pressure alone might result in substantial overdiagnosis. Ambulatory monitoring before the start of lifelong drug treatment might lead to more appropriate targeting of treatment, particularly around the diagnostic threshold.

8.4 HOME vs. ABPM (more details in the online supplemental file S8.4)

When combined with OBP, both HBPM and ABPM can identify white-coat and masked hypertension in untreated and treated individuals. The threshold for BP normality is indicated as similar for HBP and ambulatory daytime BP (≥ 135/85 mmHg), whereas a lower threshold is recommended for 24-h ABP (≥ 130/80 mmHg). The similar diagnostic ability of HBPM and ABPM is probably because of the fact that both methods provide multiple measurements taken away from the office setting in the usual environment of each individual. However, there are also important methodological differences between them, as HBP is measured only after few minutes rest, in a standardized sitting posture at home and during the day, whereas ABP is measured at different postures (sitting, standing and lying), in different environments (work, home, other) and during routine daytime activities and night-time sleep. Thus, HBPM and ABPM are similar but are not identical methods and the diagnostic agreement between them is sometimes a challenging clinical issue. ABPM has been indicated as the most reliable and accurate measurement of BP for diagnosing hypertension and while assessing the response to therapy, as it provides information about specific patterns of BP behavior, such as nocturnal dipping, morning surge and short-term variability over 24-h. At variance from ABPM, HBPM it is widely available, relatively inexpensive and well accepted by patients, particularly for repeated monitoring. Consequently, current guidelines recommend also HBPM as a method for the evaluation of BP in untreated individuals with suspected hypertension and, more so, for monitoring the long-term BP control in treated hypertensive patients. An important issue to consider is the reproducibility of BP information provided by HBPM and ABPM, respectively, which was shown to be similar by a direct comparison of HBPM and ABPM data in the same individuals, or even higher for HBPM. In a recent meta-analysis of 58 studies, diagnostic performance of HBPM was slightly higher than OBP. Indeed, a normal OBP can be accompanied by elevated HBP in case of masked hypertension. However, some individuals with normal HBP showed elevated BP from 24-h ABPM, suggesting that ABPM is still necessary for confirming the diagnosis of hypertension. A recent study, in agreement with previously published PAMELA study data indicated that individuals showing a diagnostic disagreement between their home and ambulatory BP may have cardiovascular risks that are intermediate between those with sustained home and ambulatory normotension and hypertension. However, no precise indications are given in available guidelines on when and in which particular patients to use ABPM or HBPM and the decision to use ABPM or HBPM often reflects the preference of the individual patient and of the healthcare provider. The healthcare system in which a patient is managed may also be a factor. Although it remains unclear whether one approach is superior to the other for diagnosing hypertension and monitoring BP control, it has to be acknowledged that HBPM and ABPM are equivalent but they measure different aspects of the BP behaviour, so they represent complementary rather than alternative approaches. See Box 19. The 2018 ESC/ESH Hypertension guidelines emphasize the complementary role of HBPM and ABPM and recommend that both methods should be used, whenever possible. Unfortunately, this is not often possible in low-resource settings because of healthcare costs and unavailability of these approaches, in particular ABPM, in daily practice, which might make HBPM the preferred out-of-office BPM method.

### Screening for hypertension in adults: US preventive services task force reaffirmation recommendation statement [^114VwHvs]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF hypertension screening — screening intervals and implementation details. The USPSTF suggests annual screening for hypertension in adults 40 years or older and for adults at increased risk for hypertension (such as Black persons, persons with high-normal blood pressure, or persons who are overweight or obese). Screening less frequently (e.g., every 3 to 5 years) is appropriate for adults aged 18 to 39 years not at increased risk for hypertension and with a prior normal blood pressure reading. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring offers the most evidence-based risk information for future cardiovascular events. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring devices are small portable machines that record blood pressure noninvasively at typically 20- to 30-minute intervals over 12 to 24 hours while patients go about their normal activities or are asleep. Home blood pressure monitoring devices are fully automated oscillometric devices that record measurements taken from the patient's brachial artery, are activated by patients or caregivers, and measurements are taken much less frequently than with ABPM (eg, 1 to 2 times a day or week, although the blood pressure measurements can be spread out over more time).

### Automated blood pressure measuring devices: how are they clinically validated for accuracy? [^116ui8Uo]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

Accurate blood pressure (BP) assessment is essential for the optimal diagnosis and management of hypertension. Contemporary clinical practice guidelines strongly endorse use of automated cuff blood pressure measuring devices (BPMD) as the preferred means of measuring and monitoring BP in the office, at home and with ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. To ensure that they are accurate, automated BPMDs should undergo clinical validation testing, performed using an established clinical validation standard. Unfortunately, most BPMDs sold on the global market have not been clinically validated. Furthermore, in the last thirty years, several different clinical validation protocols have been published, with major differences apparent between these standards, causing controversy with respect to which standard is considered acceptable for clinical validation. Complexly worded standards, multiple revisions, and firewalled access also contribute to a lack of understanding and use of clinical validation standards and the number of expert centers performing clinical validations is small. Recently, joint society collaborations have led to creation of the AAMI/ESH/ISO universal standard for the clinical validation of automated cuff BPMDs. Not only is this unified standard a necessary step, but oversight from regulators and influential stakeholders to ensure that only clinically validated BPMDs can be marketed is additionally needed.

### Achievement rate of blood pressure control [^117QzhPK]. Hypertension Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Recent updates to international hypertension guidelines have converged toward a therapeutic target of < 130/80mmHg, as reflected in the JSH2025, AHA/ACC2025, and ESC2024 recommendations. Strong evidence from major outcome trials such as SPRINT, STEP, BPROAD, and ESPRIT has consistently demonstrated the benefit of intensive blood pressure (BP) control, particularly systolic BP < 130mmHg, across a wide spectrum of hypertensive populations, including the elderly and those with diabetes, CKD, or cardiovascular comorbidities. The JSH2025 guidelines further emphasize home BP management, setting a lower target of < 125/75mmHg, supported by prospective nationwide studies such as J-HOP and HONEST. However, despite these advances in evidence and recommendations, real-world BP control rates remain unsatisfactory, underscoring the critical need for effective implementation strategies. To address this gap, we propose the "achievement rate of BP control < 130/80mmHg" as a unified, core implementation metric for hypertension management. This target is consistent with both JSH2025 and AHA/ACC2025 guidelines, as well as with Japan's Asakatsu campaign. We further recommend a dual-layered evaluation framework: a macro-approach (spatial, population-level) using office BP or health-check BP to assess outcomes in the general hypertensive population, and a micro-approach (temporal, individual-level) using home BP to monitor the quality of daily management and treatment adherence. Adopting this integrated framework will enable the simultaneous assessment of both public health impact and individualized care quality, providing a practical and evidence-based index for bridging guidelines with daily clinical practice. Ultimately, widespread application of this unified implementation metric has the potential to accelerate progress toward improved global cardiovascular outcomes. Core metric 130/80 mmHg of implementation hypertension. BP, blood pressure.

### Emergence of home blood pressure-guided management of hypertension based on global evidence [^113J39Jp]. Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

Recent guidelines for the management of hypertension from the 2018 European Society of Cardiology/European Society of Hypertension and the 2017 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA), have stressed the importance of out-of-office blood pressure (BP) measurement for hypertension management. There has been a similar emphasis on out-of-office BP monitoring for the management of hypertension in the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, and other Asian countries. – Ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) and home BP monitoring (HBPM) are 2 well-validated approaches for measuring out-of-office BP. In the published literature, HBPM is a term that has commonly referred to the self-measurement of BP at home, although in some studies, HBPM has been used to describe a provider or research assistant measuring an individual's BP in his/her home. ABPM and HBPM can identify white coat hypertension (diagnostic disagreement between office and out-of-office BP in untreated subjects) and white coat uncontrolled hypertension (diagnostic disagreement in treated subjects). – Although ABPM has been the preferred method for out-of-office measurement, the 2017 ACC/AHA BP guideline considered HBPM to be a more practical approach in clinical practice than ABPM, particularly for individuals taking antihypertensive medication. The 2014 Japanese Society of Hypertension Guidelines for the Management of Hypertension proposed HBPM as the most effective and practical for guiding antihypertensive medication initiation and titration in clinical care, while waiting for intervention trials demonstrating better cardiovascular outcomes in patients managed based on out-of-office BP levels.

### Self-measured blood pressure monitoring at home: a joint policy statement from the American Heart Association and American medical association [^117L3HHa]. Circulation (2020). Medium credibility.

The diagnosis and management of hypertension, a common cardiovascular risk factor among the general population, have been based primarily on the measurement of blood pressure (BP) in the office. BP may differ considerably when measured in the office and when measured outside of the office setting, and higher out-of-office BP is associated with increased cardiovascular risk independent of office BP. Self-measured BP monitoring, the measurement of BP by an individual outside of the office at home, is a validated approach for out-of-office BP measurement. Several national and international hypertension guidelines endorse self-measured BP monitoring. Indications include the diagnosis of white-coat hypertension and masked hypertension and the identification of white-coat effect and masked uncontrolled hypertension. Other indications include confirming the diagnosis of resistant hypertension and detecting morning hypertension. Validated self-measured BP monitoring devices that use the oscillometric method are preferred, and a standardized BP measurement and monitoring protocol should be followed. Evidence from meta-analyses of randomized trials indicates that self-measured BP monitoring is associated with a reduction in BP and improved BP control, and the benefits of self-measured BP monitoring are greatest when done along with cointerventions. The addition of self-measured BP monitoring to office BP monitoring is cost-effective compared with office BP monitoring alone or usual care among individuals with high office BP. The use of self-measured BP monitoring is commonly reported by both individuals and providers. Therefore, self-measured BP monitoring has high potential for improving the diagnosis and management of hypertension in the United States. Randomized controlled trials examining the impact of self-measured BP monitoring on cardiovascular outcomes are needed. To adequately address barriers to the implementation of self-measured BP monitoring, financial investment is needed in the following areas: improving education and training of individuals and providers, building health information technology capacity, incorporating self-measured BP readings into clinical performance measures, supporting cointerventions, and enhancing reimbursement.

Wearable devices: new perspective for HBPM (Box 8)

The recent technological advances have stimulated the development of wearable systems for health monitoring. Before regular adoption of wearable technologies for HBPM, important issues should be addressed, related to system accuracy, efficiency, reliability, legislation, interoperability, services, reimbursement and costs and ethical issues. Preliminary results are promising but there is a strong need for larger, long-term and well designed clinical studies to make these novel solutions really applicable in real-life patients' care. The recent introduction of wearable devices measuring BP at wrist level with the oscillometric method also requires further investigations, also aimed at providing reference values for BP self-measured 'on the move'.

Box 8

7.1.2 Clinical validation (Box 9)

As with all BP measurement methods, the use of accurate devices is fundamental for the reliable evaluation of HBP. Aiming to standardize the validation procedures of BP monitors and establish minimum accuracy standards, in the last three decades, the US Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI), the British Hypertension Society, the European Society of Hypertension (ESH) Working Group on BP Monitoring and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), have developed protocols for clinical validation of BP-measuring devices. Unfortunately, most of the devices available on the market have not been subjected to independent validation using one of these protocols. In 2018, the AAMI, ESH and ISO developed a single universally acceptable standard (AAMI/ESH/ISO, ISO 81060–2:2018), which is intended to replace all previous protocols. Until data on the accuracy of BP monitors using the Universal Standard become plentiful, it is recommended to use only those that have been validated by any of the above-mentioned protocols. A device that has been successfully validated in a general population sample might not be accurate in a special population [children, pregnancy, atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease (CKD), arm circumference > 42 cm] and separate validation in each of these populations is recommended. Devices suggested by manufacturers to have equivalent BP measurement function need their equivalence to be independently checked. Updated lists of successfully validated BP measuring devices using an established protocol, and lists of equivalent devices are provided at.

### Use of home blood-pressure monitoring in the detection, treatment and surveillance of hypertension [^114TVqLM]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Use of home blood-pressure monitoring is increasing but the technique and the equipment have limitations. We provide an overview of recent evidence in this rapidly evolving field.

Recent Findings

Home blood-pressure monitoring is an acceptable method for screening patients for hypertension. There is increasing evidence supporting the predictive power of home blood pressure for stroke risk even in the general population. The identification of white-coat and masked hypertension remains an important role for home blood-pressure monitoring. Unvalidated equipment and poor patient technique are major concerns. The purchase of devices needs to be linked to a simple patient-education programme, which is perhaps an opportunity for collaboration between healthcare providers and commercial companies. Devices that store the blood-pressure measurements in the memory are preferred to ensure accuracy of reporting. Data-transmission systems providing automatic storage, transmission and reporting of blood pressure, direct involvement of the patient and potentially a reduced number of hospital/general practitioner visits, offer significant advantages. To reduce patient anxiety, overuse of home blood-pressure monitoring should be avoided but there is the potential for self-modification of treatment, subject to certain safeguards.

Summary

Self-monitoring of blood pressure is developing rapidly, linked to increasing awareness of the impact of reducing high blood pressure on public health and the marketing/advertising strategies used to sell automatic devices. Home blood-pressure monitoring has a role in the detection and management of blood pressure, but not at the expense of careful blood-pressure measurement in the office and adherence to national guidelines.

### Direct comparison of the reproducibility of in-office and self-measured home blood pressures [^117Q2awB]. Journal of Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Antihypertensive drug treatment is likely to be conducted for a long-term period, and continual monitoring of blood pressure is essential. Recent guidelines recommended self-measured home blood pressure 'to confirm the diagnosis of hypertension and for titration of blood pressure-lowering medication' and as a tool for monitoring blood pressure control. In the untreated population, home blood pressure measurements have high reproducibility for short-term, as well as 1-year long-term intervals. However, there has been no robust evidence for the reproducibility of home blood pressure with respect to the catchment intervals in patients on antihypertensive medication, which would be a fundamental prerequisite to using home blood pressure measurement widely in clinical practice.

The COmparison of Self-measured home, Automated unattended office and Conventional attended office blood pressure (COSAC) study showed that unattended automated office blood pressure (AOBP), which is measured in office by an automated blood pressure measurement device under stringent conditions including the absence of an observer (unattended), provides better in-office blood pressure information but it requires more medical resources than conventional office blood pressure, and AOBP cannot replace the self-measured home blood pressure. Similar to home blood pressure, little attention has been given to the reproducibility of AOBP, and this issue was not discussed even in recent debates. Furthermore, no previous studies compared the reproducibility of AOBP with that of self-measured home blood pressure. Therefore, the enrolled COSAC study patients were followed-up for 1 year, and the aim was to directly compare the short-term to long-term reproducibility of in-office unattended and attended blood pressures with self-measured home blood pressure.

### Optimal number of days for home blood pressure measurement [^114shH52]. American Journal of Hypertension (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Current guidelines make no outcome-based recommendations on the optimal measurement schedule for home blood pressure (BP).

Methods

We enrolled 4,802 randomly recruited participants from three populations. The participants were classified by their (i) cross-classification according to office and home BP (normotension, masked hypertension, white-coat hypertension, and sustained hypertension) and (ii) home BP level (normal BP, high normal BP, grade 1 and 2 hypertension), while the number of home measurement days was increased from 1 to 7. The prognostic accuracy of home BP with an increasing number of home BP measurement days was also assessed by multivariable-adjusted Cox models.

Results

Agreement in classification between consecutive measurement days indicated near perfect agreement (κ ≥ 0.9) after the sixth measurement day for both office and home BP cross-classification (97.8% maintained classification, κ = 0.97) and home BP level (93.6% maintained classification, κ = 0.91). Over a follow-up of 8.3 years, 568 participants experienced a cardiovascular event, and the first home BP measurement alone predicted events significantly (P ≤ 0.003). The confidence intervals (CIs) were too wide and overlapping to show superiority of multiple measurement days over the first measurement day (hazard ratios per 10mm Hg increase in systolic BP at initial day, 1.11 [CI 1.07–1.16]; that at 1–7 days, 1.18 [CI 1.12–1.24]). Masked hypertension, but not white-coat hypertension, was associated with increased cardiovascular risk, irrespective of the number of home measurement days.

Conclusion

Even a single home BP measurement is a potent predictor of cardiovascular events, whereas seven home measurement days may be needed to reliably diagnose hypertension.

Home BP Threshold of 135/85 mm Hg

A commonly recommended HBPM monitoring schedule consists of performing morning and evening BP measurements twice on each occasion over a minimum of 3 days with a preferred period of 7 days. Traditionally, out-of-office BP thresholds have been determined by using the regression and outcome-derived approacheswith data from observational studies. The threshold for high out-of-office BP corresponding to an office BP threshold of 140/90 mm Hg has been determined to be 135/85 mm Hg for both home and daytime BP on ABPM.–

### Screening for high blood pressure in adults… [^114dZz4p]. AAFP (2016). Low credibility.

2, 3 However, these reviews did not address the diagnostic accuracy of different blood pressure measurement protocols or identify a reference standard for measurement confirmation. For the current recommendation, the USPSTF examined the diagnostic accuracy of office blood pressure measurement, ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, and home blood pressure monitoring. The USPSTF also assessed the accuracy of these blood pressure measurements and methods in confirming the diagnosis of hypertension. In addition, the USPSTF reviewed data on optimal screening intervals for diagnosing hypertension in adults. Clinical Considerations PATIENT POPULATION UNDER CONSIDERATION This recommendation applies to adults aged 18 years or older without known hypertension. Ambulatory and Home Blood Pressure Monitoring. In addition to office blood pressure measurement, ABPM and HBPM may be used to confirm a diagnosis of hypertension after initial screening.

Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring devices are small, portable machines that record blood pressure at regular intervals over 12 to 24 hours while patients go about their normal activities and while they are sleeping. Measurements are typically taken at 20- to 30-minute intervals. Home blood pressure measurement devices are fully automated oscillometric devices that record measurements taken from the patient's brachial artery. Many of these devices are available for retail purchase, and some have undergone technical validation according to recommended protocols. The USPSTF found convincing evidence that ABPM is the best method for diagnosing hypertension. Although the criteria for establishing hypertension varied across studies, there was significant discordance between the office diagnosis of hypertension and 12- and 24-hour average blood pressures using ABPM, with significantly fewer patients requiring treatment based on ABPM (see.

For these reasons, the USPSTF recommends ABPM as the reference standard for confirming the diagnosis of hypertension. Good-quality evidence suggests that confirmation of hypertension with HBPM may be acceptable. Several studies showed that elevated home blood pressure was significantly associated with increased risk for cardiovascular events, stroke, and all-cause mortality, independent of office blood pressure (see. 1 Therefore, the USPSTF considers ABPM to be the reference standard for confirming the diagnosis of hypertension. However, the USPSTF acknowledges that the use of ABPM may be problematic in some situations. Home blood pressure monitoring using appropriate protocols is an alternative method of confirmation if ABPM is not available. Measurements from the office, HBPM, and ABPM all must be interpreted with care and in the context of the individual patient. Patients with very high blood pressure or signs of end-organ damage may need immediate treatment.

### Status of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring and home blood pressure monitoring for the diagnosis and management of hypertension in the US: an up-to-date review [^111PL8qq]. Hypertension Research (2023). Medium credibility.

The diagnosis and management of hypertension has been based on the measurement of blood pressure (BP) in the office setting. However, data have demonstrated that BP may substantially differ when measured in the office than when measured outside the office setting. Higher out-of-office BP is associated with increased cardiovascular risk independent of office BP. Ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) and home BP monitoring (HBPM) are validated approaches for out-of-office BP measurement. In the 2015 and 2021 United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) reports on screening for hypertension, ABPM was recommended as the reference standard for out-of-office BP monitoring and for confirming an initial diagnosis of hypertension. This recommendation was based on data from more published studies of ABPM vs. HBPM on the predictive value of out-of-office BP independent of office BP. Therefore, HBPM was recommended as an alternative approach when ABPM was not available or well tolerated. The 2017 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) BP guideline recommended ABPM as the preferred initial approach for detecting white-coat hypertension and masked hypertension among adults not taking antihypertensive medication. In contrast, HBPM was recommended as the preferred initial approach for detecting the white-coat effect and masked uncontrolled hypertension among adults taking antihypertensive medication. The current review provides an overview of ABPM and HBPM in the US, including best practices, BP thresholds that should be used for the diagnosis and treatment of hypertension, barriers to widespread use of such monitoring, US guideline recommendations for ABPM and HBPM, and data supporting HBPM over ABPM.

### The case for home monitoring in hypertension [^113zmFy3]. BMC Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Management with self-monitored readings

Most international hypertension guidelines suggest the use of clinic measurements to guide management and make little mention of the variability of blood pressure outlined above. Where they mention the use of ambulatory or self-blood pressure monitoring, they are careful to emphasise the importance of using such information in conjunction with that obtained by clinic measurements, although how this is to be done is often not defined.

As long as we hold to a definition of 140/90 as the threshold for defining hypertension, it is worth emphasising that for both an average daytime ambulatory pressure and the average of a set of home-monitored readings, this equates roughly to around 135/85.

There are a number of algorithms and guidelines available as to how one might use self-monitoring of blood pressure to diagnose and manage hypertension, and they all depend upon obtaining a set of readings before making a clinical decision. Once one averages 20–25 readings, the figure derived is at least twice as reproducible as that in the clinic and is practicable for most patients (see Figure 2).

Figure 2
Suggested model for self-monitoring of blood pressure, adapted from (BMJ Publishing Group Ltd. Copyright 2008) Whilst there is no clear evidence base to prefer this model, it will deliver an average of 24 readings and has been adopted by the European Society of Hypertension, the American Society of Hypertension and the American College of Cardiology (see). *The protocol should consist of a series of measurements over 7 days with two measurements morning and evening. The first day's data should be discarded and the remaining 24 measurements averaged. Any management decision must be preceded by monitoring, such that at least 10 measurements are available for averaging. Cardiovascular risk is calculated using equations that incorporate office blood pressure measurements, not self-monitored readings.

Hypertension monitoring — home blood pressure self-monitoring (HBPM): Among patients treated for hypertension, we suggest offering home blood pressure self-monitoring with co-interventions for lowering systolic and diastolic blood pressure (Weak for | Reviewed, New-added). When compared with usual care, home blood pressure self-monitoring has been shown to improve systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) control when paired with a co-intervention, and our evidence review found two systematic reviews (SRs) of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). One SR of 29 RCTs showed improved blood pressure control compared to usual care (adjusted MD in SBP 2.7 mm Hg). Another SR and meta-analysis found that self-monitoring alone was not associated with lower blood pressure; however, when paired with co-interventions blood pressure self-monitoring was associated with a lower blood pressure (MD in SBP -6.1 mm Hg). Three additional RCTs were consistent, finding self-monitoring more effective than usual care when accompanied by medication titration in response to self-monitoring data, while studies examining medication adherence revealed no difference between self-monitoring and usual care. There was some question among the Work Group members whether a 2–4 mm Hg reduction in blood pressure was clinically significant.

### Diagnostic accuracy of office blood pressure measurement and home blood pressure monitoring for hypertension screening among adults: results from the IDH study [^11413vf1]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Recent hypertension guidelines and the 2021 United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) report recommend using office blood pressure (BP) measurements as an initial screening test for identifying hypertension and to use out‐of‐office BP monitoring for confirming the presence of high BP among those who have high office BP. Ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) has been recommended as a reference standard for out‐of‐office BP monitoring over home BP monitoring (HBPM).HBPM has been recommended as an alternative to ABPM.

A key question that was addressed in a 2021 systematic review by Guirguis‐Blake et alfor the USPSTF was the diagnostic accuracy of high office BP based on initial single visit as screening for hypertension compared with high awake BP or 24‐hour BP on ABPM, the reference standard. Other key questions were the diagnostic accuracy of high confirmatory office BP, defined as high office BP at a subsequent visit or visits, and separately, the diagnostic accuracy of high BP on HBPM, each compared with high awake BP or 24‐hour BP on ABPM among adults with an initially high office BP. However, there were several evidence‐based gaps in the 2021 systematic review by Guirguis‐Blake et al. All studies in the pooled analyses used the BP thresholds for hypertension recommended in the Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure guideline: high office BP ≥ 140/90 mm Hg, high home BP ≥ 135/85 mm Hg, high awake BP ≥ 135/85 mm Hg, and high 24‐hour BP ≥ 130/80 mm Hg. None of the studies used the BP thresholds recommended in the more recent 2017 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) BP guideline: high office BP ≥ 130/80 mm Hg, high home BP ≥ 130/80 mm Hg, high awake BP ≥ 130/80 mm Hg, and high 24‐hour BP ≥ 125/75 mm Hg. Further, studies using awake BP and, separately, 24‐hour BP, as the reference standard were placed in the same pooled analysis without being distinguished from one another. Awake BP is recommended as the reference standard for diagnosing hypertension in the 2017 ACC/AHA BP guideline. Finally, most studies used the auscultatory method with a mercury sphygmomanometer to measure office BP instead of the oscillometric method, which is more common in clinical practice.

BP Measurement and Correspondence of Office and Out-of-Office Readings

Errors in BP measurement are a major source of BP misclassification. Both guidelines place strong emphasis on accurate measurement of BP by using validated devices and multiple readings for diagnosis and management of hypertension (Tables 1–3). The ACC/AHA recommends averaging office BP readings, using the same advice for ≥ 2 readings on ≥ 2 occasions provided in previous Joint National Committee reports, and recommends confirmation of office hypertension by means of out-of-office measurements. The ESC/ESH recommends 3 readings for office BP measurement, with additional readings when the first 2 differ by > 10 mm Hg or BP is unstable because of an arrhythmia, and advises confirmation of office hypertension by means of either repeated office readings at several visits or by out-of-office BP measurements. Both guidelines recommend out-of-office BP measurements to recognize masked and white coat hypertension. They provide only slightly different treatment guidance for white coat and masked hypertension, while mentioning the uncertainty of such recommendations. The ACC/AHA CPG provides corresponding values for office and out-of-office measurements (home blood pressure monitoring, ambulatory blood pressure monitoring) in the range of 120/80 mm Hg to 160/100 mm Hg for office BP measurements, whereas the ESC/ESH provides only the corresponding cutoff values for the diagnosis of hypertension for home blood pressure monitoring and ambulatory blood pressure monitoring measurements. The latter are, however, concordant with the corresponding values in the ACC/AHA guideline (Tables 1–3).

HOME BP MEASUREMENT: SCHEDULE, THRESHOLDS, AND APPROACHES

Good patient information and training, use of standardized procedures and use of a validated device are essential for ensuring the accuracy and reliability of home BP measurements (Figure 1). Patients need to be provided with general information about hypertension diagnosis and treatment, along with guidance on how to select an appropriate HBPM device and how to measure their own BP (ideally accompanied by a hands-on demonstration). It is important to remind patients not to overuse HBPM and not to modify their antihypertensive therapy without consulting their physician. In addition to being validated, the HBPM device should use an upper-arm cuff oscillometric method (with an appropriately sized cuff) and be able to automatically store all readings; telehealth-equipped devices that can transmit readings to healthcare providers are preferable. The patient should have an empty bladder, and rest quietly in a seated position with the back supported and both feet on the floor for 2–5 minutes before taking home BP measurements. The cuff of the device should be placed directly above the elbow and pulled taut, with the arm supported on a flat surface. Morning measurements should be made before breakfast and before taking any antihypertensive drugs, and evening measurements should be taken before going to bed. At least 2 readings should be taken, 1–2 minutes apart, and measurements should be made for at least 3 (preferably 7) consecutive days.,

Figure 1.
Key recommendations for ensuring accurate measurement of home blood pressure.

The key parameters provided by HBPM include morning BP, evening BP, and the morning–evening difference in BP. The relationship between values for these home BP measures and office BP is shown in Table 2. However, 1 limitation of standard HBPM is that measurements are only taken at 2 times during the day (morning and evening) in a relatively low-stress environment (i.e. the patient's home). Given that young adult workers often show increased work site BP, especially during stressful conditions, even when home BP is well controlled, there may be also be a role for HBPM in the work place.

Variation in Blood Pressure Self-monitoring Recommendations and Uptake

Patients and clinicians alike described variation in how often they used or recommended, respectively, home self-monitoring. Clinicians described varying success in obtaining values, including requesting patients to send them via the EHR portal, email, or telephone or requesting in-person blood pressure checks. Several clinicians recognized increased reliance on patient-reported data during the COVID-19 pandemic but found it difficult to direct care due to ranges in how data are collected. A common barrier was ensuring consistent or easy access to blood pressure monitors, particularly because clinicians had little knowledge about whether insurance would cover them. Clinicians expressed great interest in better guidance:

Patient: "I would if I had extra money. I know I need to do it. It's just, when can I spare that extra money?"

Clinician: "So often, we ask patients to monitor at home, and you get a small chunk who will get a cuff and report data back. There is some confusion about the appropriate cuff. As a physician, I will, in our EHR, order a cuff, and I think, done. Right? Cuff's been ordered. Well, was there coverage? There's a lot of challenges I don't even recognize about how one secures a cuff and if they secure an appropriate one. When patients come back and actually did A, B, and C, I think 'Wow, you did?'"

Physical barriers, such as blood pressure cuff size, were also repeatedly mentioned by patients and clinicians as something confusing. Standard cuffs were often too small for overweight patients. Patients also reported often preferring wrist cuffs, but clinicians vastly preferred arm cuffs, citing increased accuracy and data quality:

Patient: "I don't really check it at home because it's really hard to get a cuff. They don't fit when I order a small cuff, and I need a bigger cuff. I do take my blood pressure, but I don't think it's always accurate".

Clinician: "There's such variability in the quality of cuffs available to the public, and some people buy a cuff that goes around your wrist, and I don't trust those".

16 CONCLUSION

Compared with the last 2008–2010 Position Papers, the number of articles published in the field of HBPM in the last decade has been on considerable rise and convincing evidence has now further clarified several aspects about the use of HBPM in clinical practice and research. Some of these new indications are summarized in Boxes 31 and 32. Additional evidence is still needed from population studies and randomized trials on hypertension management, to clarify whether hypertension management based on out-of-office BP, in particular on HBPM, leads to a better outcome than hypertension management guided by OBP.

### The case for home monitoring in hypertension [^114ucQ3Y]. BMC Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Self- or Home Blood Pressure Monitoring

There remains variability in the literature as to what to call this technology, and although the term 'home monitoring' is still used extensively, such devices can be used in any environment.

The science that led to the development of ambulatory monitors is available in small, simple-to-use self-monitors that use the same oscillometric technology and allow patients to measure blood pressure themselves semiautomatically as often as they wish or as required.

Home monitors are generally at least an order of magnitude cheaper than ambulatory devices and can be bought without reference to a health care professional in major pharmacies in the United Kingdom and many other countries.

As such electronic devices have developed; national specialist organisations have recommended that they are validated against the so-called 'gold standard' of the mercury manometer and a variety of validation protocols have been published to ensure that retailed machines are indeed accurate.

It is salutary to note that there is no obligation on a manufacturer to demonstrate accuracy before selling their devices, and there are examples of inaccurate machines being sold to the public. In Great Britain and Ireland, there are important agencies that have realised this problem and maintain a web-based list of validated devices for both patients and healthcare professionals.

The average blood pressure obtained by multiple measurements with a self-monitor approximates to the daytime average of an ambulatory monitor, and there are some who have argued that self-monitoring can displace an ambulatory monitor in all aspects of hypertension diagnosis and management. What most home monitors will still not do is measure blood pressure through the night, and it is worth mentioning in passing that there is evidence that nocturnal pressure has independent predictability in terms of cardiovascular outcomes. As we do not yet have any clinical strategies as to how to treat nocturnal pressure, this remains an area for further research rather than a practical clinical reality.

At-home blood pressure measurement — feasibility and limitations: Numerous studies have shown that it is feasible for families to conduct repeated measurements at home, and home BP measurements appear to be more reproducible than those conducted in the office. There are several practical concerns with the use of home BP measurement, however; the only normative data available are from the relatively small Arsakeion School study, only a few automated devices have been validated for use in the pediatric population with limited cuff sizes, and there is no consensus regarding how many home measurements across what period of time are needed to evaluate BP. Home BP measurements show no consistent pattern when compared with office measurements.

### The potential for overdiagnosis and underdiagnosis because of blood pressure variability: a comparison of the 2017 ACC / AHA, 2018 ESC / ESH and 2019 NICE hypertension guidelines [^11563p1A]. Journal of Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Overdiagnosis causes well people to be labelled as abnormal or diseased with possible adverse psychosocial and financial consequences, and usually results in overtreatment with possible physical harms. It may occur because of overdetection because of increased sensitivity of a new test, and/or overdefinition because of expanded definition of disease (including lowered thresholds). A recent example of overdefinition is the expanded definition of 'Hypertension' by the 2017 ACC/AHA high BP Guideline to include 46% of the adult population, by lowering the diagnostic threshold from 140/90 to 130/80 mmHg. Most of the newly classified are unlikely to benefit from their diagnosis in terms of cardiovascular disease prevention, but may be harmed as a result of disease labelling, adverse drug effects or having to now declare a pre-existing "disease" to organisations, such as insurance companies.

The 2017 ACC/AHA guideline recommends averaging at least two office measurements before making a diagnosis of 'hypertension' on an individual patient, and ideally confirming this diagnosis by then averaging multiple out-of-office measurements (Table 1). The guideline's emphasis on accurate measurement technique, both in office and at home, has been commended and some have suggested that this may prevent overdiagnosis of 'hypertension' in individual patients. However, lowering the diagnostic threshold to a level close to the population average means that measurement variability, even if reduced by averaging multiple measurements, may have a large clinical impact. This can happen as the large proportion of adults who have a SBP just below the new diagnostic threshold may have an average that still tips them over the threshold and results in a 'hypertension' label.

### Emergence of home blood pressure-guided management of hypertension based on global evidence [^115Xzq9o]. Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

There is strong evidence that high home BP is associated with increased CVD risk. HBPM can be used to identify specific hypertension phenotypes such as white coat hypertension, masked hypertension, white coat uncontrolled hypertension, and masked uncontrolled hypertension. Morning hypertension, based on the average of morning home BP readings, and nocturnal hypertension, based on the average of nighttime BP readings on nocturnal HBPM can be detected by newer HBPM devices. The proposal of using lower office BP and home BP thresholds by the 2017 ACC/AHA BP guideline (ie, 130/80 mm Hg for both office BP and home BP) has raised new perspectives about hypertension diagnosis and management, but has also added some uncertainties in this field. Randomized controlled trials are needed to define the optimal home BP threshold and target goal for the appropriate use of HBPM in routine management of hypertension, including investigations focused on the nocturnal home BP levels.

### Attitudes of primary care physicians and their patients about home blood pressure monitoring in Ontario [^113UhcwA]. Journal of Hypertension (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

Guidelines recommend home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM) to improve blood pressure control, but the attitudes of primary care physicians and their hypertensive patients towards its use are not known.

Methods

A 28-item self-administered survey about home blood pressure monitoring was mailed to a random sample of 1418 primary care physicians in Ontario and 765 (55%) were returned. Of the 478 physicians treating hypertension, 299 agreed to give surveys to their hypertensive patients. We received 149 patient surveys.

Results

The majority of primary care physicians (63%) often or almost always encouraged their hypertensive patients to monitor their own blood pressure at home. Only 13%, however, preferred home blood pressure monitoring to office or ambulatory readings for diagnostic purposes and 19%, to guide therapy. Physicians had concerns about patients becoming preoccupied with home monitoring (70%) and the accuracy of home devices (65%). Most patients (78%) had a device at home, and 84% indicated that their doctor encouraged them to measure blood pressure. Yet, 80% received no advice from their physician on the type of device to purchase, only 8% had specific training on proper measurement technique, 68% did not regularly take the results to the doctor and 39% did nothing specific about alarming readings.

Conclusions

Primary care physicians prefer office or ambulatory to home readings to make diagnostic and therapeutic decisions. While home monitoring is popular among patients, its clinical usefulness is undermined by the lack of reliable purchasing information, standard measurement protocols, proper training on measurement technique and specific instructions on handling and interpreting results.

### Home blood pressure monitoring in pediatric hypertension: the US perspective and a plan for action [^112sTws8]. Hypertension Research (2018). Low credibility.

The 2017 US guidelines for pediatric hypertension place considerable emphasis on blood pressure measurements, which are the cornerstone for hypertension diagnosis and management. It is recognized that when the diagnosis of hypertension is based solely on office blood pressure measurements, many children are misclassified (over- or underdiagnosed). Therefore, out-of-office blood pressure evaluations using ambulatory or home blood pressure monitoring are often necessary to obtain an accurate diagnosis. Strong evidence for the diagnostic and clinical value of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring in children has justified its central role in decision making in recent pediatric recommendations. However, ambulatory blood pressure monitoring is not widely accessible in primary care. There is little evidence for home blood pressure monitoring in children, yet this method is widely available and feasible for the evaluation of elevated blood pressure in children. This article presents a case for using home blood pressure monitoring for the management of children with suspected or treated hypertension in clinical practice in comparison to using office measurements or ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, as well as its optimal application. More research on home blood pressure monitoring in children is urgently needed.

1 INTRODUCTION

Arterial hypertension is one of the principal cardiovascular risk factors, and still represents a largely unmet public health challenge given its close association with mortality and morbidity globally because of cardiovascular, cerebrovascular and kidney disease-related complications. The current suboptimal management of hypertension might be in part related to the limitations of using only office blood pressure (BP), which has led to increasing use of out-of-office BP. Adoption of home BP monitoring (HBPM), in particular, has had an exponential growth, favoured by technological progress, which has led to the availability of small, accurate, user-friendly and relatively inexpensive BP monitoring devices. The present paper provides an update of previous recommendations from the ESH Working Group on BP Monitoring and Cardiovascular Variability (BPMCVV) sequentially published in years 2000, 2008 and 2010 and from AHA.

When fully automated blood pressure measurement is not available, we suggest measurement of blood pressure using standard technique and a properly calibrated and validated sphygmomanometer. We suggest using out-of-office blood pressure monitoring methods (ambulatory 24-hour monitoring or home blood pressure measurements) to inform the diagnosis and management of hypertension. Among patients treated for hypertension, we suggest offering home blood pressure self-monitoring with co-interventions for lowering systolic and diastolic blood pressure.

INTRODUCTION

Hypertension is a key risk factor for cardiovascular disease and stroke, the most important causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. In the UK, hypertension affects more than 13.5 million individuals and contributes to approximately 75 000 deaths annually. Effective detection and management of hypertension requires accurate and consistent monitoring. Home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM) has been shown to correlate more strongly with cardiovascular outcomes than office blood pressure measurements and is now recommended for both diagnosis and monitoring in national and international guidelines. HBPM has become a routine part of hypertension management in primary care, with evidence supporting improved hypertensive control when self-monitoring is combined with professional and self-titration of antihypertensive therapy.

Despite evidence for HBPM efficacy, an international consensus on the optimal HBPM strategy has yet to be reached. Current guidelines offer different recommendations regarding the number of days required for accurate assessment. The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) 2024 hypertension guidelines suggest that monitoring should continue beyond three days only if the average BP approaches the treatment threshold. While Hodgkinson et al. (2019) made a similar recommendation, the ESC guidelines do not differentiate between diagnostic and long-term monitoring protocols, treating all self-monitoring periods similarly. In contrast, the NICE 2019 Hypertension Guidelines advocate for a 7-day monitoring period. While Groenland et al. propose 4.5 consecutive days of HBPM, their study population had no prior monitoring experience and monitored for a total of 7 days.

A key consideration in HBPM protocols is the well documented "day 1 effect", where systolic BP is systematically higher on the first day of monitoring, likely due to an initial alerting response. With repeated short-term BP monitoring, recorded systolic blood pressure values are known to reduce in association with a fall in the alerting reaction. It remains unclear whether this phenomenon persists with long-term self-monitoring. We hypothesise that with prolonged HBPM, BP variability decreases, leading to more stable and reliable measurements over time. If true, this could support shorter monitoring periods for long-term HBPM users and potentially challenge the necessity of excluding day 1 readings after patients have become accustomed to self-monitoring.

Utilising HBPM data collected from over 6 months, this study aimed to evaluate the impact of prior monitoring on blood pressure variability and assess whether a reduced HBPM regimen could be recommended for long-term monitors. Specifically, the study seeks to determine:

### Lancet commission on hypertension group position statement on the global improvement of accuracy standards for devices that measure blood pressure [^112bsJEV]. Journal of Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

The Lancet Commission on Hypertension identified that a key action to address the worldwide burden of high blood pressure (BP) was to improve the quality of BP measurements by using BP devices that have been validated for accuracy. Currently, there are over 3000 commercially available BP devices, but many do not have published data on accuracy testing according to established scientific standards. This problem is enabled through weak or absent regulations that allow clearance of devices for commercial use without formal validation. In addition, new BP technologies have emerged (e.g. cuffless sensors) for which there is no scientific consensus regarding BP measurement accuracy standards. Altogether, these issues contribute to the widespread availability of clinic and home BP devices with limited or uncertain accuracy, leading to inappropriate hypertension diagnosis, management and drug treatment on a global scale. The most significant problems relating to the accuracy of BP devices can be resolved by the regulatory requirement for mandatory independent validation of BP devices according to the universally-accepted International Organisation for Standardization Standard. This is a primary recommendation for which there is an urgent international need. Other key recommendations are development of validation standards specifically for new BP technologies and online lists of accurate devices that are accessible to consumers and health professionals. Recommendations are aligned with WHO policies on medical devices and universal healthcare. Adherence to recommendations would increase the global availability of accurate BP devices and result in better diagnosis and treatment of hypertension, thus decreasing the worldwide burden from high BP.

### KDIGO 2021 clinical practice guideline for the management of blood pressure in chronic kidney Disease [^1127239Y]. Kidney International (2021). High credibility.

KDIGO 2021 blood pressure in chronic kidney disease — out-of-office blood pressure measurement: We suggest that out-of-office BP measurement with either ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) or home BP monitoring (HBPM) be used to complement standardized office BP readings for the management of high BP (2B). We suggest using an initial ABPM to supplement standardized office BP and HBPM for ongoing management of BP, and this is a weak recommendation according to GRADE. For individuals not taking antihypertensive medication identified as having "white-coat" hypertension, annual out-of-office BP assessments may be useful, and for individuals taking antihypertensive medication, 1 week of daily HBPM prior to each office visit may be useful to complement standardized office BP. Providers working in areas where ABPM is unavailable may choose to use HBPM instead of an initial ABPM procedure, and patients who find ABPM and HBPM to be uncomfortable and inconvenient may prefer not to use such devices. Masked hypertension and masked uncontrolled hypertension are present among 9%–30% of adults without high BP based on office measurements, while "white-coat" hypertension and the "white-coat" effect are present among 15%–30% of adults with high BP based on office measurements.
