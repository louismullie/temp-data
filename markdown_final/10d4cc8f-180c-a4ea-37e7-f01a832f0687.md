## Question

48-year-old woman 2 weeks after emergency appendectomy under general inhalational anesthesia presents with fever, vomiting, jaundice, tender hepatomegaly, elevated AST and predominantly direct hyperbilirubinemia; viral hepatitis markers are negative; liver biopsy shows massive centrilobular necrosis.

A 48-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of a 1-day history of fever, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Two weeks ago, while visiting Guatemala, she had an emergency appendectomy under general inhalational anesthesia. During the surgery, she received a transfusion of 1 unit of packed red blood cells. Her temperature is 38.3°C (100.9°F) and blood pressure is 138/76 mm Hg. Examination shows jaundice and tender hepatomegaly. Serum studies show:
Alkaline phosphatase 102 U/L
Aspartate aminotransferase 760 U/L
Bilirubin
Total 3.8 mg/dL
Direct 3.1 mg/dL
Anti-HAV IgG positive
Anti-HAV IgM negative
Anti-HBs positive
HBsAg negative
Anti-HCV antibodies negative
Abdominal ultrasonography shows an enlarged liver. A biopsy of the liver shows massive centrilobular necrosis. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's condition?"

Answer Choices:
A. Acalculous inflammation of the gallbladder
B. Virus-mediated hepatocellular injury
C. Adverse effect of anesthetic
D. Gram-negative bacteria in the bloodstream

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which underlying cause best explains a 48-year-old woman with massive centrilobular hepatic necrosis, marked AST elevation, direct hyperbilirubinemia, and negative viral hepatitis serologies, occurring two weeks after general inhalational anesthesia for appendectomy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical syndrome and whether it fits a hepatocellular injury pattern. Then, I should verify the timing and exposure history, especially to halogenated anesthetics. Next, I will examine the histopathology and whether centrilobular necrosis points to ischemia or drug toxicity. After that, I need to check competing etiologies like viral hepatitis, sepsis-related cholestasis, and acalculous cholecystitis. Finally, I will weigh the strength of evidence for anesthetic-induced liver injury and choose the most likely answer with supporting references.

> Let me first confirm the clinical pattern. The patient has marked AST elevation with predominantly direct hyperbilirubinemia, jaundice, and tender hepatomegaly, which together indicate a hepatocellular injury with cholestasis rather than isolated cholestasis or hemolysis, and this aligns with standard evaluation frameworks for jaundice and liver test abnormalities [^3aca242b].

> Wait, let me verify the timing and exposure. The onset is about two weeks after general inhalational anesthesia, which sits squarely within the typical window for halogenated anesthetic–associated hepatitis, and the exposure to a volatile agent is the key environmental trigger to consider here [^notfound].

> I will now examine the histopathology. Massive centrilobular necrosis is a classic pattern seen with ischemic or toxic liver injury, and it is repeatedly described in the context of halogenated anesthetic hepatotoxicity, including sevoflurane and isoflurane, where centrilobular necrosis and hepatic failure have been reported in postmarketing and clinical literature [^a35eaf60] [^82e74865] [^8f5d0a55].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about viruses. The hepatitis serologies show anti-HAV IgG positive with IgM negative, indicating prior immunity, and HBsAg and anti-HCV are negative, which effectively rules out acute viral hepatitis as the cause of this presentation, so I should not attribute this to virus-mediated hepatocellular injury [^notfound].

> Let me consider sepsis-related cholestasis. Sepsis can cause conjugated hyperbilirubinemia via impaired bile transport, but the degree of AST elevation here is far more consistent with severe hepatocellular necrosis than with cholestasis alone, and there is no clear septic source identified in the vignette, making gram-negative bacteremia less likely as the primary driver of this pattern [^3aca242b].

> Next, I should review acalculous cholecystitis. Acalculous cholecystitis can occur postoperatively and may present with jaundice and right upper quadrant pain, but it does not typically produce massive centrilobular necrosis on liver biopsy; the histology here argues strongly against gallbladder inflammation as the underlying cause of this liver injury pattern [^notfound].

> I need to ensure the mechanistic plausibility is sound. Halogenated anesthetics can cause immune-mediated or metabolite-driven hepatocellular injury, with risk factors including female sex, middle age, obesity, prior exposure, and CYP induction; sevoflurane is metabolized to hexafluoroisopropanol and can generate Compound A, and although it is often considered less hepatotoxic than older agents, cases of severe hepatitis, centrilobular necrosis, and hepatic failure are documented in the FDA labeling and clinical literature, which fits this case temporally and pathologically [^eac2a6a4] [^a35eaf60] [^8f5d0a55].

> But wait, what if this were ischemic hepatitis from hypotension during surgery? I should double-check that possibility. There is no mention of intraoperative hypotension or shock, and the biopsy pattern of massive centrilobular necrosis can reflect either ischemia or toxic injury; given the clear exposure to a halogenated anesthetic and the absence of an alternative explanation, anesthetic-induced hepatotoxicity remains the most parsimonious diagnosis here [^notfound].

> Putting this together, the most likely underlying cause is an adverse effect of the inhalational anesthetic, consistent with halogenated anesthetic–associated hepatitis presenting two weeks postoperatively with marked AST elevation, direct hyperbilirubinemia, and centrilobular necrosis on biopsy, particularly in a middle-aged woman with recent exposure [^a35eaf60] [^82e74865] [^8f5d0a55].

> Final answer: C. Adverse effect of anesthetic.

---

The most likely cause is **halothane hepatitis** (halogenated anesthetic hepatotoxicity) [^71de1286], given the timing after inhalational anesthesia, the pattern of massive centrilobular necrosis on liver biopsy, and the exclusion of viral hepatitis. This idiosyncratic, immune-mediated injury typically presents 1–3 weeks post-exposure with fever, jaundice, and marked transaminase elevations, and can progress to fulminant hepatic failure. The other options are less consistent with the clinical and histologic findings: acalculous cholecystitis does not cause centrilobular necrosis, viral hepatitis is excluded by serology, and sepsis-related liver injury would show a different histologic pattern and clinical context.

---

## Clinical features supporting halogenated anesthetic hepatotoxicity

- **Timing**: Symptoms began 2 weeks after exposure to halogenated anesthetics, consistent with halothane hepatitis [^notfound].
- **Clinical presentation**: Fever, jaundice, and tender hepatomegaly are classic features of halothane hepatitis [^notfound].
- **Laboratory findings**: Markedly elevated AST (760 U/L) and predominantly direct hyperbilirubinemia (total 3.8 mg/dL, direct 3.1 mg/dL) indicate hepatocellular injury with cholestasis [^3aca242b].
- **Liver biopsy**: Massive centrilobular necrosis is a characteristic histological finding in halothane hepatitis [^notfound].

---

## Mechanism of halogenated anesthetic hepatotoxicity

Halogenated anesthetics (e.g. halothane, sevoflurane, isoflurane) can cause **idiosyncratic, immune-mediated liver injury** [^8f5d0a55]. The proposed mechanism involves:

- **Metabolic activation**: Halothane is metabolized by cytochrome P450 to trifluoroacetyl chloride, which binds liver proteins, forming haptens that trigger immune responses [^8f5d0a55].
- **Immune-mediated injury**: Sensitized T cells attack hepatocytes, causing necrosis, particularly in the centrilobular zone [^notfound].
- **Risk factors**: Female sex, middle age, obesity, multiple exposures, and genetic predisposition increase risk [^8f5d0a55].

---

## Comparison with other differential diagnoses

| **Differential diagnosis** | **Clinical features** | **Histological findings** | **Consistency with case** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Acalculous cholecystitis | - Right upper quadrant pain <br/> - Fever <br/> - Jaundice | Gallbladder wall thickening, edema, no centrilobular necrosis | Inconsistent |
| Virus-mediated hepatocellular injury | - Positive viral serology <br/> - Acute hepatitis symptoms | Variable, but not specific for centrilobular necrosis | Inconsistent (serology negative) |
| Gram-negative bacteria in the bloodstream | - Sepsis <br/> - Shock <br/> - Multi-organ dysfunction | Cholestasis, mild hepatocellular injury | Inconsistent (no sepsis features) |

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

The most likely cause of the patient's condition is **halogenated anesthetic-induced hepatotoxicity (halothane hepatitis)** [^71de1286], given the temporal relationship, clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and characteristic liver biopsy showing massive centrilobular necrosis. Immediate discontinuation of halogenated anesthetics, supportive care, and close monitoring are essential. Future anesthesia should avoid halogenated agents, and alternative anesthetics should be considered.

5.7	Liver Injury

Clinically significant liver injury, without findings of viral hepatitis, has been reported in the postmarketing setting in patients treated with anti-CD20 B-cell depleting therapies approved for the treatment of MS, including OCREVUS. Signs of liver injury, including markedly elevated serum hepatic enzymes with elevated total bilirubin, have occurred from weeks to months after administration.

Patients treated with OCREVUS found to have an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) greater than 3× the upper limit of normal (ULN) with serum total bilirubin greater than 2× ULN are potentially at risk for severe drug-induced liver injury.

Obtain liver function tests prior to initiating treatment with OCREVUS [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)], and monitor for signs and symptoms of any hepatic injury during treatment. Measure serum aminotransferases, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin levels promptly in patients who report symptoms that may indicate liver injury, including new or worsening fatigue, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, right upper abdominal discomfort, dark urine, or jaundice. If liver injury is present and an alternative etiology is not identified, discontinue OCREVUS.

### Isoflurane [^71de1286]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Signs consistent with malignant hyperthermia may include hyperthermia, hypoxia, hypercapnia, muscle rigidity (e.g., jaw muscle spasm), tachycardia (e.g., particularly that unresponsive to deepening anesthesia or analgesic medication administration), tachypnea, cyanosis, arrhythmias, hypovolemia, and hemodynamic instability. Skin mottling, coagulopathies, and renal failure may occur later in the course of the hypermetabolic process.

Successful treatment of malignant hyperthermia depends on early recognition of the clinical signs. If malignant hyperthermia is suspected, discontinue all triggering agents (i.e., volatile anesthetic agents and succinylcholine), administer intravenous dantrolene sodium, and initiate supportive therapies. Consult prescribing information for intravenous dantrolene sodium for additional information on patient management. Supportive therapies include administration of supplemental oxygen and respiratory support based on clinical need, maintenance of hemodynamic stability and adequate urinary output, management of fluid and electrolyte balance, correction of acid base derangements, and institution of measures to control rising temperature.

Hepatic Reactions

Cases of mild, moderate and severe postoperative hepatic dysfunction or hepatitis with or without jaundice, including fatal hepatic necrosis and hepatic failure, have been reported with isoflurane.

Such reactions can represent hypersensitivity hepatitis, a known risk of exposure to halogenated anesthetics, including isoflurane. As with other halogenated anesthetic agents, Isoflurane may cause sensitivity hepatitis in patients who have been sensitized by previous exposure to halogenated anesthetics (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).

### Evaluation of jaundice in adults (...) [^3aca242b]. AAFP (2017). Low credibility.

7 Fractionated bilirubinemia is required to differentiate between conjugated and unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. A complete blood count with a peripheral blood smear can help identify hemolysis and evaluate for anemia of chronic disease and thrombocytopenia, which is common in decompensated cirrhosis. Elevated alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase levels can indicate hepatocellular damage. However, levels may be normal in chronic liver disease. In such cases, there may not be enough normal liver parenchymal tissue to release elevated levels of these enzymes. 7 Protein, albumin, and prothrombin time or international normalized ratio are associated with liver synthetic function. Low levels of protein and albumin, or elevated prothrombin time or international normalized ratio, indicate decreased synthetic function and hepatic decompensation.

If the jaundice etiology is unknown after the initial laboratory evaluation, it is necessary to perform additional tests including hepatitis panels and autoimmune panels, such as antinuclear, smooth muscle, and liver-kidney microsomal antibodies.
3. 14 Viral hepatitis causes increased oxidative stress within hepatocytes, leading to cell death, scarring, and diminished liver mass available for normal function. 4, 15 Chronic alcohol consumption can cause various hepatic disorders, including steatosis or fatty liver disease with minimal symptoms and often no jaundice; alcoholic hepatitis with acute onset jaundice and more severe symptoms; and cirrhosis, which is often associated with decompensation and liver failure in the setting of jaundice. 17 Although the exact mechanism is poorly understood, liver lipid deposition may trigger inflammation and fibrosis, particularly when coupled with type 2 diabetes.

17 Sepsis may also induce hyperbilirubinemia as circulating acute phase reactants and bacterial endotoxins disrupt bilirubin transport, leading to cholestasis and elevated bile salt levels. 18, 19. EXTRAHEPATIC DISORDERS: CHOLESTASIS Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia may also arise from extrahepatic obstruction. Patients with biliary obstruction may present with multiple signs and symptoms, including fever, pruritus, abdominal pain, weight loss, muscle wasting, dark urine, and pale stools. Choledocholithiasis is the most common non-neoplastic cause of biliary obstruction, accounting for 14% of all new cases of jaundice.

Postmarketing Experience

The following adverse events have been identified during post-approval use of sevoflurane USP. Due to the spontaneous nature of these reports, the actual incidence and relationship of sevoflurane USP to these events cannot be established with certainty.

Central Nervous System

Seizures: Postmarketing reports indicate that sevoflurane use has been associated with seizures. The majority of cases were in children and young adults, most of whom had no medical history of seizures. Several cases reported no concomitant medications, and at least one case was confirmed by EEG. Although many cases were single seizures that resolved spontaneously or after treatment, cases of multiple seizures have also been reported. Seizures have occurred during, or soon after sevoflurane induction, during emergence, and during post-operative recovery up to a day following anesthesia.

### The national halothane study and hospital outcomes [^c44276e7]. Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

The National Halothane Study: A Study of the Association Between Halothane Anesthesia and Postoperative Hepatic Necrosis. Report of the Subcommittee on the National Halothane Study, Committee on Anesthesia, Division of Medical Sciences, National Academy of Sciences-National Research Council. By Bunker JP, Forrest WH, Mosteller FJ, and Vandam LD. Bethesda, Maryland, National Institutes of Health, 1969. Halothane, a potent nonflammable inhalational anesthetic, was introduced into clinical practice in the United Kingdom in 1956 and the United States in 1958. Shortly after its release for use, isolated published reports appeared of fatal postoperative hepatic necrosis in patients who had received halothane during surgery. "Halothane hepatitis" became a clinical diagnosis, although no studies had confirmed halothane as the actual cause of liver failure. The Public Health Service's National Research Council (Washington, D.C.), the operating arm of the National Academy of Sciences, decided to sponsor a study to determine whether halothane hepatitis was an actual clinical entity. They contacted John P. Bunker, M.D., a National Academy of Sciences member and chair of the Department of Anesthesia at the Stanford University School of Medicine (Stanford, California), to study the question. Bunker asked a new postgraduate research fellow, William H. Forrest, Jr., M.D., to design, organize, and manage a study to determine whether exposure to halothane caused hepatic failure.

### Tolvaptan (Jynarque) [^94b7098e]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1	Serious Liver Injury

JYNARQUE can cause serious and potentially fatal liver injury. Acute liver failure requiring liver transplantation has been reported in the post-marketing ADPKD experience. Discontinuation in response to laboratory abnormalities or signs or symptoms of liver injury (such as fatigue, anorexia, nausea, right upper abdominal discomfort, vomiting, fever, rash, pruritus, icterus, dark urine or jaundice) can reduce the risk of severe hepatotoxicity.

In a 3-year placebo-controlled trial and its open-label extension (in which patients' liver tests were monitored every 4 months), evidence of serious hepatocellular injury (elevations of hepatic transaminases of at least 3 times the upper limit of normal [ULN] combined with elevated bilirubin at least 2 times the ULN) occurred in 0.2% (3/1487) of tolvaptan-treated patients compared to none of the placebo-treated patients.

To reduce the risk of significant or irreversible liver injury, assess ALT, AST and bilirubin prior to initiation of JYNARQUE, at 2 weeks and 4 weeks after initiation, then monthly for 18 months and every 3 months thereafter.

At the onset of signs or symptoms consistent with hepatic injury or if ALT, AST, or bilirubin increase to >2 times ULN, immediately discontinue JYNARQUE, obtain repeat tests as soon as possible (within 48 to 72 hours), and continue testing as appropriate. If laboratory abnormalities stabilize or resolve, JYNARQUE may be reinitiated with increased frequency of monitoring as long as ALT and AST remain below 3 times the ULN.

Do not restart JYNARQUE in patients who experience signs or symptoms consistent with hepatic injury or whose ALT or AST ever exceeds 3 times the ULN during treatment with tolvaptan, unless there is another explanation for liver injury and the injury has resolved.

In patients with a stable, low baseline AST or ALT, an increase above 2 times baseline, even if less than 2 times the ULN, may indicate early liver injury. Such elevations may warrant treatment suspension and prompt (48 to 72 hours) re-evaluation of liver test trends prior to reinitiating therapy with more frequent monitoring.

### Unveiling the hidden risk: a case of severe jaundice triggered by intra-aortic balloon pump after cardiac surgery [^6e4734f7]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Fig. 1 
The position of the IABP balloon in the patient’s X-ray and CT scan. (A) Chest X-ray confirmed correct positioning of the balloon. (B) The distal end of the IABP balloon extended to the renal artery ostium. (C) The diameter of the abdominal aorta is about 16 mm, the inflated IABP balloon nearly blocked the narrow abdominal aorta. CT, computed tomography; IABP, intra-aortic balloon pump

As initial medical interventions proved inadequate, plasma exchange therapy was initiated on day 5 to mitigate hyperbilirubinemia. However, the TB levels continued to rise, necessitating additional plasma exchange the following day. Investigation into post-cardiac surgery jaundice revealed a DB/TB ratio of approximately 50–60%, along with an absence of progressive anemia, no detectable valvular leaks on ultrasound, and normal hemolysis studies ruling out hemolytic jaundice. Furthermore, there was no evidence of drug-induced liver injury or any abnormalities on viral hepatitis markers and abdominal ultrasound.

Abdominal CT examination performed on day 7 demonstrated normal liver size and morphology, with a homogeneous parenchymal density. The imaging revealed no anatomical abnormalities in the portal venous drainage system and no dilatation of the intra- or extrahepatic bile ducts. However, it did show bile stasis in the gallbladder, a fullness in the pancreatic head, and a blurred retroperitoneal fat space, collectively raising the suspicion of concurrent pancreatitis. Notably, careful review of the imaging indicated that the distal end of the patient’s IABP balloon had extended beyond the celiac trunk, reaching the origin of the renal artery (Fig. 1 B). Furthermore, the patient’s abdominal imaging revealed a slender abdominal aortic diameter of approximately 16 mm. When the IABP balloon was fully inflated, it closely adhered to the aortic wall, nearly occupying the entire segment of the aorta through which it passed (Fig. 1 C). Consequently, we hypothesize that the hepatic impairment may be associated with reduced hepatic blood flow due to the celiac trunk obstruction by the IABP balloon. Alongside the evidence of liver damage, the patient also displayed elevated amylase levels and radiological signs indicative of pancreatitis.

### Vanzacaftor, tezacaftor, and deutivacaftor (Alyftrek) [^ac2ce06f]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1	Drug-Induced Liver Injury and Liver Failure

Elevated transaminases have been observed in patients treated with ALYFTREK [Adverse Reactions (6.1)] . Cases of serious and potentially fatal drug-induced liver injury and liver failure have been reported in patients with and without a history of liver disease who were taking a fixed-dose combination drug containing elexacaftor, tezacaftor, and ivacaftor (ELX/TEZ/IVA), which contains the same or similar active ingredients as ALYFTREK. Liver injury has been reported within the first month of therapy and up to 15 months following initiation of ELX/TEZ/IVA.

Assess liver function tests (ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin) in all patients prior to initiating ALYFTREK. Assess liver function tests every month during the first 6 months of treatment, then every 3 months for the next 12 months, then at least annually thereafter. Consider more frequent monitoring in patients with a history of liver disease, elevated liver function tests at baseline, or a history of elevated liver function tests with drugs containing ELX, TEZ and/or IVA. [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7)].

Interrupt ALYFTREK in the event of signs or symptoms of liver injury. These may include:

Significant elevations in liver function tests (e.g., ALT or AST >5× the upper limit of normal (ULN) or ALT or AST >3× ULN with bilirubin >2× ULN)
Clinical signs or symptoms suggestive of liver injury (e.g., jaundice, right upper quadrant pain, nausea, vomiting, altered mental status, ascites)

Consider referral to a hepatologist and follow patients closely with clinical and laboratory monitoring until abnormalities resolve. If abnormalities resolve and if the benefit is expected to outweigh the risk, resume ALYFTREK treatment with close monitoring.

ALYFTREK should not be used in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C). ALYFTREK is not recommended in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B) and should only be considered when there is a clear medical need, and the benefit outweighs the risk. If used, monitor patients closely [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Use in Specific Populations (8.7), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Sevoflurane — sevoflurane, — volatile for inhalation [^a33270b2]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Nitrous Oxide

As with other halogenated volatile anesthetics, the anesthetic requirement for sevoflurane is decreased when administered in combination with nitrous oxide. Using 50% N2O, the MAC equivalent dose requirement is reduced approximately 50% in adults, and approximately 25% in pediatric patients (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

Neuromuscular Blocking Agents

As is the case with other volatile anesthetics, sevoflurane increases both the intensity and duration of neuromuscular blockade induced by nondepolarizing muscle relaxants. When used to supplement alfentanil-N2O anesthesia, sevoflurane and isoflurane equally potentiate neuromuscular block induced with pancuronium, vecuronium or atracurium. Therefore, during sevoflurane anesthesia, the dosage adjustments for these muscle relaxants are similar to those required with isoflurane.

Potentiation of neuromuscular blocking agents requires equilibration of muscle with delivered partial pressure of sevoflurane. Reduced doses of neuromuscular blocking agents during induction of anesthesia may result in delayed onset of conditions suitable for endotracheal intubation or inadequate muscle relaxation.

Among available nondepolarizing agents, only vecuronium, pancuronium and atracurium interactions have been studied during sevoflurane anesthesia. In the absence of specific guidelines:

For endotracheal intubation, do not reduce the dose of nondepolarizing muscle relaxants.
During maintenance of anesthesia, the required dose of nondepolarizing muscle relaxants is likely to be reduced compared to that during N2O/opioid anesthesia. Administration of supplemental doses of muscle relaxants should be guided by the response to nerve stimulation.

The effect of sevoflurane on the duration of depolarizing neuromuscular blockade induced by succinylcholine has not been studied.

Hepatic Function

Results of evaluations of laboratory parameters (e.g., ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin, etc.), as well as investigator-reported incidence of adverse events relating to liver function, demonstrate that sevoflurane can be administered to patients with normal or mild-to-moderately impaired hepatic function. However, patients with severe hepatic dysfunction were not investigated.

Occasional cases of transient changes in postoperative hepatic function tests were reported with both sevoflurane and reference agents. Sevoflurane was found to be comparable to isoflurane regarding these changes in hepatic function.

Cases of mild, moderate, and severe hepatic dysfunction or hepatitis (e.g., jaundice associated with fever and/or eosinophilia) after anesthesia with sevoflurane have been reported. Clinical judgement should be exercised when sevoflurane is used in patients with underlying hepatic conditions or under treatment with drugs known to cause hepatic dysfunction (see ADVERSE REACTIONS).

It has been reported that previous exposure to halogenated hydrocarbon anesthetics may increase the potential for hepatic injury.

### Histologic features of liver injury associated with SARS-CoV-2 messenger RNA vaccines [^8a371538]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Context.—

Many drugs can induce liver injury; however, vaccine-induced liver injury is a rare phenomenon. SARS-CoV-2 messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines are now widely administered, and clinical evidence of liver injury has been reported.

Objective.—

To characterize the histologic features of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine-associated liver injury.

Design.—

Thirteen liver biopsies from 12 patients with elevated liver enzymes clinically favored to be secondary to SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine were identified between 2021 and 2022. Demographics, clinical information, and histologic features of liver biopsies were reviewed.

Results.—

All patients (median age, 58 years; M:F = 4:8) received at least 1 dose of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines (7 Pfizer and 5 Moderna). Four patients had a history of liver disease. Nine patients developed symptoms between 1 day and 2 months after receiving the vaccine dose. Viral serologies were negative. Drug-induced liver injury was thought to be less likely clinically in the 3 patients who had started new medications. Autoimmune antibodies were detected in 9 patients. Moderate to severe active hepatitis was the dominant histologic pattern of injury (9 of 13 biopsies; 69%). Resolving hepatitis, cholestatic hepatitic injury, and bile duct injury were identified in 1 biopsy each. All patients recovered spontaneously or with steroid therapy, except one patient who developed autoimmune hepatitis.

Conclusions.—

Moderate to severe active hepatitis is commonly observed in SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine-associated liver injury, and female patients may be more susceptible to injury. Liver injury resolves spontaneously or with steroid treatment. In rare cases, these vaccines may trigger an underlying immune condition.

What other guideline statements are available on this topic?

There are no other nationally or internationally agreed guidelines for screening, identification and standardised management of patients with excessive alcohol consumption who are having elective and emergency surgical procedures. Accepting that the focus of this consensus statement is on the peri‐operative management of patients with excessive alcohol consumption, we have also drawn on evidence related to hepatic disease and its anaesthetic implications.

### Darunavir ethanolate and cobicistat (Prezcobix) [^d9935d00]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Hepatotoxicity

During the darunavir clinical development program (N=3063), where darunavir was co-administered with ritonavir 100 mg once or twice daily, drug-induced hepatitis (e.g., acute hepatitis, cytolytic hepatitis) was reported in 0.5% of participants. Patients with pre-existing liver dysfunction, including chronic active hepatitis B or C, have an increased risk for liver function abnormalities including severe hepatic adverse reactions.

Post-marketing cases of liver injury, including some fatalities, have also been reported with darunavir co-administered with ritonavir. These have generally occurred in patients with advanced HIV-1 disease taking multiple concomitant medications, having co-morbidities including hepatitis B or C co-infection, and/or developing immune reconstitution syndrome. A causal relationship with darunavir co-administered with ritonavir has not been established.

Appropriate laboratory testing should be conducted prior to initiating therapy with PREZCOBIX and patients should be monitored during treatment. Increased AST/ALT monitoring should be considered in patients with underlying chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, or in patients who have pre-treatment elevations of transaminases, especially during the first several months of PREZCOBIX treatment.

Evidence of new or worsening liver dysfunction (including clinically significant elevation of liver enzymes and/or symptoms such as fatigue, anorexia, nausea, jaundice, dark urine, liver tenderness, hepatomegaly) in patients on PREZCOBIX should prompt consideration of interruption or discontinuation of treatment.

### Tipranavir (Aptivus) [^a5910560]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.2 Hepatic Impairment and Toxicity

Clinical hepatitis and hepatic decompensation, including some fatalities, were reported with APTIVUS co-administered with 200 mg of ritonavir. These have generally occurred in subjects with advanced HIV-1 disease taking multiple concomitant medications. A causal relationship to APTIVUS/ritonavir could not be established. Physicians and patients should be vigilant for the appearance of signs or symptoms of hepatitis, such as fatigue, malaise, anorexia, nausea, jaundice, bilirubinuria, acholic stools, liver tenderness or hepatomegaly. Patients with signs or symptoms of clinical hepatitis should discontinue APTIVUS/ritonavir treatment and seek medical evaluation.

All patients should be followed closely with clinical and laboratory monitoring, especially those with chronic hepatitis B or C co-infection, as these patients have an increased risk of hepatotoxicity. Liver function tests should be performed prior to initiating therapy with APTIVUS/ritonavir, and frequently throughout the duration of treatment.

If asymptomatic elevations in AST or ALT greater than 10 times the upper limit of normal occur, APTIVUS/ritonavir therapy should be discontinued. If asymptomatic elevations in AST or ALT between 5 – 10 times the upper limit of normal and increases in total bilirubin greater than 2.5 times the upper limit of normal occur, APTIVUS/ritonavir therapy should be discontinued.

Treatment-experienced patients with chronic hepatitis B or hepatitis C co-infection or elevated transaminases are at approximately 2-fold risk for developing Grade 3 or 4 transaminase elevations or hepatic decompensation. In two large, randomized, open-label, controlled clinical trials with an active comparator (1182.12 and 1182.48) of treatment-experienced subjects, Grade 3 and 4 increases in hepatic transaminases were observed in 10.3% (10.9/100 PEY) receiving APTIVUS/ritonavir through week 48. In a study of treatment-naïve subjects, 20.3% (21/100 PEY) experienced Grade 3 or 4 hepatic transaminase elevations while receiving APTIVUS/ritonavir 500 mg/200 mg through week 48.

Tipranavir is principally metabolized by the liver. Caution should be exercised when administering APTIVUS/ritonavir to patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A) because tipranavir concentrations may be increased [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Hepatitis B basics | Hepatitis B | CDC (...) [^74bd069d]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Acute hepatitis B Acute hepatitis B is a short-term illness that occurs within the first 6 months after exposure to HBV. Some people with acute hepatitis B have no symptoms or only a mild illness. For others, acute hepatitis B can cause a more severe illness that requires hospitalization. Chronic hepatitis B Acute hepatitis B can lead to a lifelong infection known as chronic hepatitis B. Left untreated, chronic hepatitis B can cause serious health problems, including liver damage, cirrhosis, liver cancer, and even death. Signs and symptoms Many people infected with hepatitis B virus won’t experience symptoms. If symptoms occur during acute infection, they often begin 90 days after exposure. Although the symptoms of acute HBV infection and chronic HBV infection may be similar, most people with chronic infection do not have symptoms until much later in life, often decades after exposure.

Symptoms of hepatitis B include:
- Dark urine or clay-colored stools
- Feeling tired
- Fever
- Joint pain
- Loss of appetite
- Nausea, stomach pain, throwing up
- Yellow skin or eyes Learn more about hepatitis B symptoms. Screening, testing, and diagnosis CDC recommends all adults get screened for hepatitis B at least once in their lifetime through a blood test. There are also some people who should be tested more often, including:
- All pregnant women during each pregnancy.
- Infants born to pregnant women with HBV infection.
- People with ongoing risk for exposures. Learn more about the types of tests used to diagnosis hepatitis B. Treatment and recovery If you are diagnosed with acute or chronic hepatitis B, find a doctor who specializes in infectious, digestive, or liver diseases. They will need to do regular tests to monitor how your liver is working.

For people with acute hepatitis B and experiencing mild symptoms, health care providers usually recommend rest, adequate nutrition, and fluids. There are no medications for acute hepatitis B. There are some medications for chronic hepatitis B; they aren't a cure and are only helpful for some people with chronic hepatitis B. Learn more about treatment options for hepatitis B.
- Get vaccinated against hepatitis A and tested for hepatitis C.
- Consider testing for hepatitis D and human immunodeficiency virus.
- Limit alcohol consumption.
- Follow a healthy diet and stay physically active.
- Check with a doctor before taking any prescription pills, nutritional or herbal supplements, or over-the-counter medications, as these can potentially damage the liver.

### Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in pediatric HIV infection [^518e408b]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Atazanavir (ATV) major toxicities—More common adverse effects include indirect hyperbilirubinemia that can result in jaundice or icterus but is not a marker of hepatic toxicity, with other symptoms including headache, fever, arthralgia, depression, insomnia, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and paresthesia. Less common effects include prolongation of the electrocardiogram PR interval, abnormalities in atrioventricular conduction generally limited to first-degree atrioventricular block with reports of second-degree block, rash that is generally mild or moderate but can include life-threatening Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and fat maldistribution and lipid abnormalities that may be less common than with other protease inhibitors; the use of ATV/r is associated with lipid abnormalities, but to a lesser extent than with other boosted protease inhibitors. Rare events include new-onset diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia, ketoacidosis, exacerbation of preexisting diabetes mellitus, spontaneous bleeding in hemophiliacs, elevation in serum transaminases, chronic kidney disease including granulomatous interstitial nephritis associated with deposition of ATV drug crystals in the renal parenchyma, nephrolithiasis, cholelithiasis, and hepatotoxicity, with patients with hepatitis B virus or hepatitis C virus infections at increased risk of hepatotoxicity.

5.6     Liver Injury

Elevations of transaminases may occur in MAYZENT-treated patients. Recent (i.e., within last 6 months) transaminase and bilirubin levels should be reviewed before initiation of MAYZENT therapy.

In Study 1, elevations in transaminases and bilirubin were observed in 10.1% of MAYZENT-treated patients compared to 3.7% of patients receiving placebo, mainly because of transaminase [alanine aminotransferase/aspartate aminotransferase/gamma-glutamyltransferase (ALT/AST/GGT)] elevations.

In Study 1, ALT or AST increased to three and five times the upper limit of normal (ULN) in 5.6% and 1.4% of MAYZENT-treated patients, respectively, compared to 1.5% and 0.5% of patients receiving placebo, respectively. ALT or AST increased eight and ten times ULN in MAYZENT-treated patients (0.5% and 0.2%, respectively) compared to no patients receiving placebo. The majority of elevations occurred within 6 months of starting treatment. ALT levels returned to normal within approximately 1 month after discontinuation of MAYZENT. In clinical trials, MAYZENT was discontinued if the elevation exceeded a 3-fold increase and the patient showed symptoms related to hepatic dysfunction.

Patients who develop symptoms suggestive of hepatic dysfunction, such as unexplained nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fatigue, anorexia, rash with eosinophilia, or jaundice and/or dark urine during treatment, should have liver enzymes checked. MAYZENT should be discontinued if significant liver injury is confirmed.

Although there are no data to establish that patients with preexisting liver disease are at increased risk to develop elevated liver function test values when taking MAYZENT, caution should be exercised when using MAYZENT in patients with a history of significant liver disease.

### Guidance for the primary care provider in identifying infants with biliary atresia by 2-4 Weeks of life: clinical report [^f8a2417e]. Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Biliary atresia background—time-to-surgery urgency and burden indicate that ideally infants are treated before 30 to 45 days of life, but in practice in the United States infants are treated on average after 60 days of life. When symptoms develop, the 1 in 8000 to 18 000 affected newborn infants each year are difficult to distinguish from the 65% of healthy newborn infants with benign causes of jaundice, and outcomes remain poor, with biliary atresia accounting for 60% of liver transplants in infants younger than 1 year and 30% of all liver transplants in children.

### Sevoflurane for refractory status asthmaticus: balancing bronchodilation with hepatic safety [^8f5d0a55]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

The recent systematic review by Ho et al. on the use of sevoflurane in refractory status asthmaticus in adults represents a valuable contribution to the literature and provides important clinical insights into this salvage therapeutic option. Nevertheless, several aspects merit further consideration.

In their discussion of adverse effects, the authors mainly emphasized hypotension and cases of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. While these complications may often be clinically manageable, it is critical to underscore the potential for rare but severe, even life-threatening, complications associated with prolonged or repeated sevoflurane administration in the intensive care setting.

Although sevoflurane is generally regarded as the least hepatotoxic of the halogenated volatile anesthetics, hepatotoxicity remains a potential concern. Unlike other halogenated anesthetics, sevoflurane does not undergo metabolism via cytochrome P450 2E1 to trifluoroacetyl chloride, a metabolite that covalently binds to hepatic proteins and elicits immune-mediated hepatocellular injury. Instead, its principal metabolite, hexafluoroisopropanol, has minimal protein-binding affinity and is rapidly glucuronidated and excreted in urine. Nevertheless, mechanisms of hepatotoxicity have been proposed, including the generation of compound A, capable of inducing oxidative stress–mediated cellular injury, and perturbations in intracellular calcium homeostasis leading to hepatocellular necrosis.

Importantly, repeated exposure to halogenated anesthetics carries the risk of immune sensitization, as reactive acyl metabolites may act as haptens, resulting in idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity upon re-exposure. Identified risk factors for volatile anesthetic–induced hepatic injury include prior exposure, middle age, female sex, obesity, renal impairment, atopy or multiple drug allergies, chronic alcohol or paracetamol use, and cytochrome P450 induction. Beyond direct hepatocellular toxicity, volatile anesthetics also decrease hepatic blood flow secondary to reductions in cardiac output, potentially compounding hepatic injury. Clinically, such complications may range from asymptomatic elevations in aminotransferases to fulminant hepatic failure requiring transplantation.

Given the risk profile, we believe it is essential to caution intensivists against the indiscriminate use of sevoflurane in status asthmaticus, particularly in patients with recognized risk factors for hepatotoxicity. While the bronchodilatory properties of sevoflurane render it an attractive therapeutic adjunct in refractory cases, the potential for severe hepatic injury—including fatal necrosis—should not be underestimated.

We therefore recommend that sevoflurane administration for status asthmaticus be avoided in patients with identifiable risk factors for volatile anesthetic–induced liver injury. We suggest this correspondence be viewed as a concise update on key safety considerations that every intensivist should be aware of when contemplating the use of sevoflurane in the management of life-threatening asthma.

### Atorvastatin calcium, film coated (atorvastatin calcium) [^49d225f5]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Concomitant intake of large quantities, more than 1.2 liters daily, of grapefruit juice is not recommended in patients taking atorvastatin [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

Discontinue atorvastatin if markedly elevated CK levels occur or if myopathy is either diagnosed or suspected. Muscle symptoms and CK elevations may resolve if atorvastatin is discontinued. Temporarily discontinue atorvastatin in patients experiencing an acute or serious condition at high risk of developing renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis (e.g., sepsis; shock; severe hypovolemia; major surgery; trauma; severe metabolic, endocrine, or electrolyte disorders; or uncontrolled epilepsy).

Inform patients of the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis when starting or increasing the atorvastatin dosage. Instruct patients to promptly report any unexplained muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever.

5.2 Immune-Mediated Necrotizing Myopathy

There have been rare reports of immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM), an autoimmune myopathy, associated with statin use, including reports of recurrence when the same or a different statin was administered. IMNM is characterized by proximal muscle weakness and elevated serum creatine kinase that persists despite discontinuation of statin treatment; positive anti-HMG CoA reductase antibody; muscle biopsy showing necrotizing myopathy; and improvement with immunosuppressive agents. Additional neuromuscular and serologic testing may be necessary. Treatment with immunosuppressive agents may be required. Discontinue atorvastatin if IMNM is suspected.

5.3 Hepatic Dysfunction

Increases in serum transaminases have been reported with use of atorvastatin [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. In most cases, these changes appeared soon after initiation, were transient, were not accompanied by symptoms, and resolved or improved on continued therapy or after a brief interruption in therapy. Persistent increases to more than three times the ULN in serum transaminases have occurred in approximately 0.7% of patients receiving atorvastatin in clinical trials. There have been rare postmarketing reports of fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure in patients taking statins, including atorvastatin.

Patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol and/or have a history of liver disease may be at increased risk for hepatic injury [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)].

Consider liver enzyme testing before atorvastatin initiation and when clinically indicated thereafter. Atorvastatin is contraindicated in patients with acute liver failure or decompensated cirrhosis [see Contraindications (4)]. If serious hepatic injury with clinical symptoms and/or hyperbilirubinemia or jaundice occurs, promptly discontinue atorvastatin.

### Infliximab-dyyb (Zymfentra) [^a8ddf086]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.4 Hepatotoxicity

Hepatobiliary disorders, including acute liver failure, jaundice abnormal hepatic function, hepatic steatosis, hepatitis, hepatotoxicity, hyperbilirubinemia and non-alcoholic fatty liver, have been reported in postmarketing data in patients receiving infliximab products. Autoimmune hepatitis has been diagnosed in some of these cases. Severe hepatic reactions occurred between two weeks to more than one year after initiation of infliximab products administered intravenously; elevations in hepatic aminotransferase levels were not noted prior to discovery of the liver injury in many of these cases. Some of these cases were fatal or necessitated liver transplantation.

In clinical trials, three subjects treated with ZYMFENTRA had drug induced liver injury based on hepatic transaminase elevations, including one subject with accompanying bilirubin elevation [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

Monitor hepatic enzymes and liver function tests every 3 to 4 months during treatment with ZYMFENTRA. Prompt investigation of the cause of liver enzyme elevation should be undertaken to identify potential cases of drug-induced liver injury. Interrupt treatment if drug-induced liver injury is suspected, until this diagnosis is excluded. Instruct patients to seek immediate medical attention if they experience symptoms suggestive of hepatic dysfuction.

5.5 Congestive Heart Failure

Cases of worsening congestive heart failure (CHF) and new onset CHF, with and without identifiable precipitating factors (e.g., pre-existing cardiovascular disease), have been reported with TNF blockers, including infliximab products. Some of these patients have been under 50 years of age, and some cases had a fatal outcome. In several exploratory trials of other TNF blockers in the treatment of CHF, there were greater proportions of TNF-blocker-treated patients who had CHF exacerbations requiring hospitalization or increased mortality. ZYMFENTRA has not been studied in patients with a history of CHF. Avoid ZYMFENTRA in patients with CHF.

If a decision is made to administer ZYMFENTRA to patients with CHF, closely monitor patients during therapy for new or worsening symptoms of heart failure and discontinue ZYMFENTRA if symptoms appear .

### Tramadol hcl and acetaminophen [^0cf5d68b]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Interactions with Drugs Affecting Cytochrome P450 Isoenzymes

The effects of concomitant use or discontinuation of cytochrome P450 3A4 inducers, 3A4 inhibitors, or 2D6 inhibitors with tramadol are complex. Use of cytochrome P450 3A4 inducers, 3A4 inhibitors, or 2D6 inhibitors with tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets requires careful consideration of the effects on the parent drug, tramadol, and the active metabolite, M1 [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7), Drug Interactions (7)] .

Hepatotoxicity

Tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets contain tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen. Acetaminophen has been associated with cases of acute liver failure, at times resulting in liver transplant and death. Most of the cases of liver injury are associated with the use of acetaminophen at doses that exceed 4,000 milligrams per day, and often involve more than one acetaminophen-containing product [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)] .

WARNING: SERIOUS AND LIFE-THREATENING RISKS FROM USE OF TRAMADOL HYDROCHLORIDE AND ACETAMINOPHEN TABLETS

See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning.

Tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse and misuse, which can lead to overdose and death. Assess each patient's risk prior to prescribing tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets, and monitor regularly for these behaviors or conditions. (5.1)
Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression may occur. Monitor closely, especially during initiation or following a dose increase. (5.2)
Accidental ingestion of tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets, especially by children, can result in a fatal overdose of tramadol. (5.2)
Concomitant use of opioids with benzodiazepines or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants, including alcohol, may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Reserve concomitant prescribing for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate; limit dosages and durations to the minimum required; and follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. (5.3, 7)
Advise pregnant women using opioids for an extended period of time of the risk of Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome, which may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated. Ensure that management by neonatology experts will be available at delivery. (5.4)
To ensure that the benefits of opioid analgesics outweigh the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has required a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) for these products. (5.5)
Life-threatening respiratory depression and death have occurred in children who received tramadol. Some of the reported cases followed tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy; in at least one case, the child had evidence of being an ultra-rapid metabolizer of tramadol due to a CYP2D6 polymorphism (5.6). Tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets is contraindicated in children younger than 12 years of age and in children younger than 18 years of age following tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy (4). Avoid the use of tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets in adolescents 12 to 18 years of age who have other risk factors that may increase their sensitivity to the respiratory depressant effects of tramadol. (5.6)
The effects of concomitant use or discontinuation of cytochrome P450 3A4 inducers, 3A4 inhibitors, or 2D6 inhibitors with tramadol are complex. Use of cytochrome P450 3A4 inducers, 3A4 inhibitors, or 2D6 inhibitors with tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets requires careful consideration of the effects on the parent drug, tramadol, and the active metabolite, M1. (5.7, 7)
Tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets contains acetaminophen. Acetaminophen has been associated with cases of acute liver failure, at times resulting in liver transplant and death. Most of the cases of liver injury are associated with the use of acetaminophen at doses that exceed 4,000 milligrams per day, and often involve more than one acetaminophen containing product. (5.9)

### Cenobamate (Xcopri) [^5e17b573]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5-100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed.

Table 3 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs.

The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials in patients with epilepsy than in clinical trials in patients with psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for epilepsy and psychiatric indications.

Anyone considering prescribing XCOPRI or any other AED must balance this risk with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated.

5.4 Liver Injury

Clinically significant liver injury has been reported in patients treated with XCOPRI in the postmarketing setting. Signs of liver injury, including markedly elevated serum hepatic transaminases with elevated total bilirubin, have been reported after administration. Acute liver failure requiring transplantation has been reported in the postmarketing setting. Elevations of serum hepatic transaminases occurred in patients receiving XCOPRI in clinical trials [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] .

Obtain serum transaminases (ALT and AST) and total bilirubin, if not recently available (i.e., within 3 months), before initiation of XCOPRI to establish baseline liver function. Monitor for signs and symptoms of any hepatic injury during treatment [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)], and obtain serum ALT and AST and total bilirubin promptly in patients who develop clinical signs or symptoms suggestive of hepatic dysfunction (e.g., unexplained nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant abdominal pain, fatigue, anorexia, jaundice, dark urine). Interrupt or discontinue treatment with XCOPRI in patients who develop liver injury without an alternative etiology.

Elevation of serum hepatic transaminases greater than three times the reference range with elevated total bilirubin greater than two times the reference range is an important predictor of severe liver injury. Early identification of elevated serum hepatic transaminases and total bilirubin and interruption or discontinuation of XCOPRI may decrease the risk of a serious outcome.

### Considerations and recommendations from the ISMRM diffusion study group for preclinical diffusion MRI: part 1: in vivo small-animal imaging [^b906b71d]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

3.2.1 Anesthesia

Isoflurane is often the anesthetic of choice given its ease of use and stability over long periods, but others can also be used.It should be noted that a stable temperature and respiration rate of the animal are targeted, and therefore, the anesthesia level should be adapted to maintain that. For prolonged scans, the isoflurane concentration can be gradually reduced if the animal respiration rate decreases.

Data acquired under different anesthetic conditions (anesthesia types, dosage, effective breathing rate, etc.) should be compared with caution, especially as the literature is conflicted.dMRI studies that examine cellular or tissue level effects typically have limited dependence on the anesthetic agent. However, in the mouse brain, mean diffusivity (MD) and mean kurtosis (MK) were both found to be lower under isoflurane than in the awake state,potentially because of inhalation isoflurane decreasing the brain extracellular space volume (cell swelling).In rats, brain ADC has been reported to increase with increasing anesthetic agent dosage for both isoflurane and medetomidine.Furthermore, dMRI used to probe physiological effects such as flow or exchange may require more consideration of the effects of each agent on physiology (vasodilation/constriction, hypoxia, and/or temperature), that have been well‐established in the context of functional MRI, for example.

Recently, advantages in the physiological properties of dexmedetomidine over its racemate medetomidine have been reported and large animal laboratories have started converting their anesthetic protocols.As effects also vary with the duration of anesthesia, it is recommended to keep timings consistent within an experimental cohort, and therefore, the delay between anesthesia onset and start of the dMRI acquisition.

For post‐scan animal recovery, inhaled anesthetics (e.g. isoflurane) have a faster elimination through the lungs, whereas injectable ones need to be metabolized and excreted (e.g. medetomidine). An antagonist to the latter is recommended to speed up the recovery phase for the animal (e.g. atipamezole).

3.2.2 Positioning

Prone is the most common positioning for the animal. However, in the case of spine imaging, the supine position may be preferred to minimize organ‐induced motion of the spine as well as reduce the distance between the spine and the coil. For liver imaging, the animal may be placed on its flank.

### The effect of cerium oxide on liver in sevoflurane-administered rats: an experimental study [^bbf10b98]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

This study is of significance since it is the first experimental study on the effect of CeO2 on liver damage caused by sevoflurane. Some limitations of this study may be the duration of sevoflurane administration, the fact that the experimental group was composed of young male rats exposed to sevoflurane for the first time and examination of a limited number of parameters.

In conclusion, in this study, histopathological and biochemical changes in the livers of the sevoflurane group were detected and histopathologically a decrease in hydropic degeneration was observed in the groups that were administered CeO2. It is thought that further studies on CeO2 with experimental groups comprising subjects with different ages, sexes, and repeated exposure to sevoflurane in order to examine biochemical parameters of oxidative damage will yield more meaningful and positive results.

### Sevoflurane [^eac2a6a4]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Recovery from Anesthesia

The low solubility of sevoflurane facilitates rapid elimination via the lungs. The rate of elimination is quantified as the rate of change of the alveolar (end-tidal) concentration following termination of anesthesia (FA), relative to the last alveolar concentration (FaO) measured immediately before discontinuance of the anesthetic. In the healthy volunteer study described above, rate of elimination of sevoflurane was similar compared with desflurane, but faster compared with either halothane or isoflurane. These results are depicted in Figure 4.

Protein Binding

The effects of sevoflurane on the displacement of drugs from serum and tissue proteins have not been investigated. Other fluorinated volatile anesthetics have been shown to displace drugs from serum and tissue proteins in vitro . The clinical significance of this is unknown. Clinical studies have shown no untoward effects when sevoflurane is administered to patients taking drugs that are highly bound and have a small volume of distribution (e.g., phenytoin).

Metabolism

Sevoflurane is metabolized by cytochrome P450 2E1, to hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) with release of inorganic fluoride and CO2. Once formed HFIP is rapidly conjugated with glucuronic acid and eliminated as a urinary metabolite. No other metabolic pathways for sevoflurane have been identified. In vivo metabolism studies suggest that approximately 5% of the sevoflurane dose may be metabolized.

### Atazanavir [^3bf816fe]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.6 Nephrolithiasis and Cholelithiasis

Cases of nephrolithiasis and/or cholelithiasis have been reported during postmarketing surveillance in patients with HIV-1 receiving atazanavir therapy. Some patients required hospitalization for additional management, and some had complications. Because these events were reported voluntarily during clinical practice, estimates of frequency cannot be made. If signs or symptoms of nephrolithiasis and/or cholelithiasis occur, temporary interruption or discontinuation of therapy may be considered [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)] .

5.7 Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions Due to Drug Interactions

Initiation of atazanavir with ritonavir, a CYP3A inhibitor, in patients receiving medications metabolized by CYP3A or initiation of medications metabolized by CYP3A in patients already receiving atazanavir with ritonavir, may increase plasma concentrations of medications metabolized by CYP3A. Initiation of medications that inhibit or induce CYP3A may increase or decrease concentrations of atazanavir with ritonavir, respectively. These interactions may lead to:

clinically significant adverse reactions potentially leading to severe, life-threatening, or fatal events from greater exposures of concomitant medications.
clinically significant adverse reactions from greater exposures of atazanavir with ritonavir.
loss of therapeutic effect (virologic response) of atazanavir with ritonavir and possible development of resistance.

See Table 16 for steps to prevent or manage these possible and known significant drug interactions, including dosing recommendations [see Drug Interactions (7)] . Consider the potential for drug interactions prior to and during therapy containing atazanavir with ritonavir; and monitor for the adverse reactions associated with concomitant medications [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7)] .

5.8 Hyperbilirubinemia

Most patients taking atazanavir experience asymptomatic elevations in indirect (unconjugated) bilirubin related to inhibition of UDP-glucuronosyl transferase (UGT). This hyperbilirubinemia is reversible upon discontinuation of atazanavir. Hepatic transaminase elevations that occur with hyperbilirubinemia should be evaluated for alternative etiologies. No long-term safety data are available for patients experiencing persistent elevations in total bilirubin >5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). Alternative antiretroviral therapy to atazanavir may be considered if jaundice or scleral icterus associated with bilirubin elevations presents cosmetic concerns for patients. Dose reduction of atazanavir is not recommended since long-term efficacy of reduced doses has not been established [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] .

### Neoadjuvant immune checkpoint inhibitors for hepatocellular carcinoma [^82b4b29d]. NPJ Precision Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

ICI therapy induces notable histopathological changes in both tumors and the liver. ICI-related histopathological changes in the liver do not show specific or pathognomonic findings and can overlap with other liver diseases. Therefore, clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and exclusion of other causes should be considered to confirm the diagnosis. ICI-related histopathological findings are variably reported in different studies including acute hepatitis with lobular inflammation, centrilobular necrosis, periportal activity, acute granulomatous hepatitis, or bile duct injuries –. The variety of these patterns might also depend on the ICI therapy agent used.

In a comprehensive review, Wang et al. highlighted the histological changes seen in HCC after neoadjuvant immunotherapy. They identified different patterns of necrosis, including coagulative necrosis with or without retaining the original tumor structure, and liquefactive necrosis marked by neutrophilic infiltration. While the clinical relevance of these necrosis patterns post-ICI therapy remains unclear, one study indicated that HCC exhibiting liquefactive necrosis tends to have a poorer prognosis following TACE treatment. Wang et al. also reported that the degenerated tumor cells can manifest in 2 ways: either as shrunken tumor cells with pyknotic nuclei with acidophilic cytoplasm or as enlarged tumor cells characterized by nuclear vacuolation and prominent nucleoli. Furthermore, intratumoral stroma can present different features such as fibrosis with inflammation, hemosiderin deposits, ductular reaction, hemorrhage, and foamy macrophages with cholesterol clefts. A recent study revealed that neoadjuvant immunotherapy also induces the formation of intratumoral TLSs. The study also showed that high TLS density after neoadjuvant therapy is associated with a better pathologic response to immunotherapy treatment and an extended RFS. These findings align with several previous studies that found that the presence of intratumoral TLS indicates a more favorable prognosis,.

### Sevoflurane — sevoflurane, — volatile for inhalation [^f22a01e1]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Sevoflurane is an inhalational anesthetic agent for use in induction and maintenance of general anesthesia. Minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) of sevoflurane in oxygen for a 40-year-old adult is 2.1%. The MAC of sevoflurane decreases with age (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION for details).

Uptake and Distribution

Solubility

Because of the low solubility of sevoflurane in blood (blood/gas partition coefficient @ 37°C = 0.63-0.69), a minimal amount of sevoflurane is required to be dissolved in the blood before the alveolar partial pressure is in equilibrium with the arterial partial pressure. Therefore, there is a rapid rate of increase in the alveolar (end-tidal) concentration (FA) toward the inspired concentration (FI) during induction.

Induction of Anesthesia

In a study in which seven healthy male volunteers were administered 70% N2O/30%O2for 30 minutes followed by 1.0% sevoflurane and 0.6% isoflurane for another 30 minutes the FA/FIratio was greater for sevoflurane than isoflurane at all time points. The time for the concentration in the alveoli to reach 50% of the inspired concentration was 4-8 minutes for isoflurane and approximately 1 minute for sevoflurane.

FA/FIdata from this study were compared with FA/FIdata of other halogenated anesthetic agents from another study. When all data were normalized to isoflurane, the uptake and distribution of sevoflurane was shown to be faster than isoflurane and halothane, but slower than desflurane. The results are depicted in Figure 3.

Recovery from Anesthesia

The low solubility of sevoflurane facilitates rapid elimination via the lungs. The rate of elimination is quantified as the rate of change of the alveolar (end-tidal) concentration following termination of anesthesia (FA), relative to the last alveolar concentration (FaO) measured immediately before discontinuance of the anesthetic.

### Nevirapine [^3ad45ee7]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Hepatotoxicity and Hepatic Impairment

Severe, life-threatening, and in some cases fatal hepatotoxicity, including fulminant and cholestatic hepatitis, hepatic necrosis and hepatic failure, have been reported in patients treated with nevirapine. In controlled clinical trials, symptomatic hepatic events regardless of severity occurred in 4% (range 0% to 11%) of subjects who received nevirapine and 1% of subjects in control groups.

The risk of symptomatic hepatic events regardless of severity was greatest in the first 6 weeks of therapy. The risk continued to be greater in the nevirapine groups compared to controls through 18 weeks of treatment. However, hepatic events may occur at any time during treatment. In some cases, subjects presented with non­-specific, prodromal signs or symptoms of fatigue, malaise, anorexia, nausea, jaundice, liver tenderness or hepatomegaly, with or without initially abnormal serum transaminase levels. Rash was observed in approximately half of the subjects with symptomatic hepatic adverse events. Fever and flu-like symptoms accompanied some of these hepatic events. Some events, particularly those with rash and other symptoms, have progressed to hepatic failure with transaminase elevation, with or without hyperbilirubinemia, hepatic encephalopathy, prolonged partial thromboplastin time, or eosinophilia. Rhabdomyolysis has been observed in some patients experiencing skin and/or liver reactions associated with nevirapine use. Hepatitis/hepatic failure may be associated with signs of hypersensitivity which can include severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, lymphadenopathy, or renal dysfunction. Patients with signs or symptoms of hepatitis must be advised to discontinue nevirapine and immediately seek medical evaluation, which should include liver enzyme tests.

### The effect of cerium oxide on liver in sevoflurane-administered rats: an experimental study [^de1d6061]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Nanotechnology continues to revolutionize various scientific fields, particularly in medicine and biomedical research. The ability to manipulate materials at the nanoscale has led to the development of innovative solutions for drug delivery, imaging, and regenerative medicine. Among nanomaterials, cerium oxide nanoparticles (CeO₂) have gained significant attention due to their remarkable redox properties and potential antioxidant effects. Their unique capacity to alternate between Ce³⁺ and Ce⁴⁺ oxidation states enables continuous scavenging of reactive oxygen species (ROS), making them promising candidates for applications in biomedicine, particularly in conditions related to oxidative stress and inflammation.

CeO₂ have demonstrated therapeutic potential in a variety of diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer. Their antioxidant properties have been leveraged to mitigate cellular damage in models of ischemia-reperfusion injury, radiation-induced toxicity, and inflammatory diseases. Despite these promising effects, research on their hepatoprotective properties remains limited. Given the critical role of oxidative stress in liver diseases, investigating the impact of CeO₂ on hepatic tissue damage is essential for exploring new therapeutic strategies.

Sevoflurane, a widely used volatile anesthetic, has been associated with oxidative stress and hepatotoxic effects in experimental and clinical settings. Although severe hepatotoxicity due to sevoflurane is rare and mostly reported as isolated cases, its increasing use in anesthesia raises concerns about potential liver damage. Approximately 5% of a sevoflurane dose undergoes biotransformation, leading to the production of reactive metabolites such as Compound A, which may contribute to hepatotoxicity. Moreover, sevoflurane has been shown to increase cytosolic free calcium (Ca²⁺) levels and generate oxidative stress, leading to hepatocyte necrosis, particularly with repeated exposure. However, the exact mechanisms underlying sevoflurane-induced liver injury remain unclear.

Given the strong antioxidant properties of CeO₂, their potential protective effects against sevoflurane-induced liver damage warrant investigation. This study aims to evaluate the hepatoprotective role of CeO₂ in sevoflurane-administered rats by examining biochemical and histopathological changes in liver tissue. Furthermore, the study will explore the anti-inflammatory and oxidative stress-modulating mechanisms of CeO₂, contributing to a deeper understanding of their biomedical applications.

By assessing the therapeutic potential of CeO₂ in this experimental model, our research provides new insights into their applications in anesthesiology and hepatology. These findings may pave the way for future studies investigating CeO₂ as novel therapeutic agents for preventing anesthesia-induced hepatic injury and other liver-related disorders.

### Synchronous multifocal necrotizing fasciitis in an infant: a case report [^1df15eba]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

CASE REPORT

A 16-month-old Caucasian girl, fully vaccinated and previously in good health, was referred to our university hospital’s pediatric emergency department by her pediatrician because of a week-long fever. The patient had suffered from acute otitis media 3 weeks before her emergency department consultation. She had been treated successfully using amoxicillin for 5 days and had recovered well. The patient had had a mild cough during fever peaks but no other signs of respiratory infection. She had suffered a single episode of vomiting during a coughing spell, with soft stools (no diarrhea) but no other digestive tract symptoms. The child was feverish at admission (38.9 °C), pale, in a weak general condition and had dark circles under her eyes. She had tachycardia, but her peripheral perfusion was maintained. Her respiratory, abdominal and neurologic statuses were within normal limits. Her throat was erythematous, with hypertrophic but exudate-free tonsils. There was no sign of otitis media, but she had multiple submandibular lymphadenopathies. Since the initial presentation suggested a fever of unknown origin, treatment was initiated using ceftriaxone. Her overall evolution during the first 48 hours was poor, and the patient developed an erythematous rash on her left upper and lower limbs, with swelling and induration of the left leg, but without crepitus, blisters or flaking. She was unable to stand, and although mobilization was unrestricted, it was painful. Laboratory results revealed an important inflammatory syndrome, with a white blood cell count of 21,000 cells/mm 3 with a left shift, an elevated C-reactive protein level (245 mg/l) and high procalcitonin (3.27 μg/l). There was also evidence of hepatic cytolysis and an elevated level of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (2368 ng/l) but with normal troponins and no associated organ failure. Blood gas levels on admission were within normal limits. Given this clinical evolution, suggestive of NF, the girl’s LRINEC score was calculated to be 7. As a result, the patient underwent several types of imaging examinations. Ultrasound of the soft tissues revealed no collections of fluid but some infiltration of adipose tissues. Because of her multiple osteoarticular and skin lesions, an MRI of the patient’s whole body was performed (Fig. 1), revealing signs of fasciitis in all 4 limbs that was particularly severe in the left leg. There was a thickening of the superficial and deep muscular fascia in all 4 limbs, with fluid collections in the left forearm, the left thigh, the left leg and the right leg (Fig. 2). There were also signs of myositis with intramuscular collections of fluid in the left thigh and leg. After the patient was given a first dose of ceftriaxone in the emergency department, her blood cultures came back positive for multi-sensitive Streptococcus pyogenes, and her antibiotic treatment was changed to intravenous amoxicillin and clindamycin. Given the clinical progression observed in the lesions during the first 48 hours of hospitalization, the results of the imaging studies and the high suspicion of NF, the patient benefited from surgical treatment during which we performed superficial and deep fasciotomies in all 4 compartments of the left leg and the medial fascia of the left thigh was also incised. Exudative fluid leaked from the incisions and was sent for culture. The subcutaneous tissue was not gray and appeared still to be bleeding slightly. The subcutaneous tissue could not easily be stripped off the superficial muscle fascia in the areas involved. The fascia appeared viable, however, and there was no skin necrosis. Widespread surgical debridement was not done, therefore, as it did not seem necessary, but intensive local washing was carried out, and extemporaneous biopsies of fascia, muscle and adipose tissue were taken. The skin incision was left open, and suction dressings were applied. Pathology examinations showed acute necrotizing inflammation of the fascia of the left thigh and the anterolateral compartment of the left leg, with bacterial pullulation only in the latter. Muscular samples taken from the left leg and left thigh revealed non-necrotizing acute inflammation. Based on all these elements and samples, the diagnosis of NF was retained. Fluid samples taken from the left leg were positive for S. pyogenes, while those taken from the thigh were negative. Two days after the first operation, follow-up surgery was performed, and an improvement in local status was observed with no signs of necrosis or progression. A tension-free wound closure was put in place over a deep drain that was removed 2 days later. The patient’s overall evolution was rapid and positive thereafter, enabling antibiotic therapy to continue orally using amoxicillin for 14 days after the last positive tissue sample for S. pyogenes.

### Genomics-informed drug-repurposing strategy identifies two therapeutic targets for preventing liver disease associated with metabolic dysfunction [^9c21787e]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2025). Medium credibility.

Identification of drug candidates

Building on a previously developed genetically informed drug-repurposing pipeline, we identified a total of 57 drugs with MASLD repurposing potential (Table S6). These drugs targeted 13 unique genes, 6.67% of the total genes identified from the TWAS, and three proteins, 7.3% of the total unique proteins identified from the protein QTL (pQTL) MR analysis. Of 57 drugs, 11 were local anesthetics (mapped to SCN2A [MIM:]), and 33 are listed in either the LiverToxor FDA DILI database,of which five are flagged as class A (well-known cause of clinically apparent liver injury), three as class B (likely rare cause of clinically apparent liver injury), and 10 as class C (probable cause of clinically apparent liver injury) in the NIH NIDDK LiverTox database, whereas FDA classified eight of the 57 drugs as having most concern for drug-induced liver injury with confirmed causal evidence linking a drug to liver injury (Table S6).

### Maralixibat chloride (Livmarli) [^55de0bdf]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Hepatotoxicity

LIVMARLI treatment is associated with a potential for drug-induced liver injury. In PFIC patients in Trial 2, treatment-emergent elevations of liver tests or worsening of liver tests, relative to baseline values, and hepatic decompensation events were observed. Two patients experienced drug-induced liver injury (DILI) attributable to LIVMARLI; one patient received 570 mcg/kg twice daily and the second patient required dose interruption and reduction. Two additional patients experienced DILI in the open-label extension portion of the trial. Of these four patients, one patient required liver transplant and another patient died.

Biliary Complications

In the placebo-controlled portion of Trial 2, two LIVMARLI-treated patients developed cholangitis or cholecystitis within 3-weeks of drug discontinuation (after 84 days and 130 days after initiating LIVMARLI treatment, respectively). Four LIVMARLI-treated patients developed cholecystitis or cholangitis in the open-label extension portion of Trial 2; the average time to onset was 281 days.

Bone Fracture

In PFIC patients in Trial 2, treatment-emergent bone fracture events were observed. Three receiving LIVMARLI experienced bone fractures relative to none in placebo-treated patients. The median time to onset of fractures was 73 days. Two LIVMARLI-treated patients developed bone fractures in the open-label portion of Trial 2, with average time to onset of fracture was 204 days.

Bleeding

In PFIC patients in Trial 2, treatment-emergent events of hematochezia (4 [8.5%] versus 1 [2.2%]), decrease in hemoglobin greater than or equal to 2 grams/dL from baseline (8 [17%] versus 1 [2.2%]), were reported more frequently in LIVMARLI-treated patients relative to placebo-treated patients

6.2 Postmarketing Experience

The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of LIVMARLI. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

Gastrointestinal disorders: hematemesis, liver transplant, post-endoscopy hemorrhage, post-liver biopsy hemorrhage

General disorders and administration site conditions: drug ineffective

Injury, poisoning and procedural complications : off label use

Investigations : gamma-glutamyltransferase increased

### Tranexamic acid-induced acute bilateral renal cortical necrosis in a young trauma patient: a case report and literature review [^2dbc7f25]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 24-year-old Caucasian woman was admitted to the intensive care unit of the University Hospital of Montpellier in June 2023 for high-energy trauma following a car accident. She had no medical history, in particular no previous obstetrical event, no family history of TMA or thrombophilia, and her only medication was a hormonal oral contraception.

On pre-hospital admission, blood pressure was around 100/60 mmHg and pulse rate was elevated at 120 bpm. Physical examination revealed diffuse abdominal pain without contracture, while no signs of peripheral hypoperfusion or external bleeding were noted. Isotonic saline solution and 1 g of TXA (Exacyl ®) were rapidly administered, and the patient was placed under mechanical ventilation support.

At intensive care unit admission, blood pressure acutely dropped to 81/55 mmHg, prompting the introduction of norepinephrine up to 0.4 mg/hour, which rapidly normalized the hemodynamic status. Initial laboratory tests notably showed: hemoglobin = 10.3 g/dl, platelet count = 163 G/l, prothrombin time = 76%, activated partial thromboplastin time ratio = 1.12, fibrinogen = 1.4 g/l, moderate hyperlactatemia of 2.2 mmol/l and a normal serum creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dl. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) detected multiple fractures, a large liver laceration associated with mild perihepatic and pelvic hemoperitoneum, without active arterial hemorrhage. Renal perfusion was preserved as well as kidney size and corticomedullary differentiation (Fig. 1 A). Initial management consisted of vascular filling and a massive transfusion protocol including a total of 5 packed red blood cells, 7 fresh-frozen plasma, 1 platelet concentrate, a four-factor human prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) 25 IU/kg and 3 g of fibrinogen. The patient also received TXA at a loading dose of 600 mg infused for one hour, followed by a maintenance dose of 1 g for 8 h. She then underwent complex orthopedic surgery at day 8, with no complication. Forty-eight hours after admission, she developed anuric AKI with a peak serum creatinine level of 5.1 mg/dl (Fig. 2), prompting the initiation of hemodialysis. A second CECT found a bilateral non-enhancement of the renal cortex, compatible with the diagnosis of diffuse acute bilateral RCN (Fig. 2 B). Some cortical territories remained perfused though, notably in the subcapsular and juxta-medullary regions (Fig. 1 B). Of note, there was no CT sign of urinary obstruction and no active bleeding. Hemodynamics remained stable, with low norepinephrine dose requirements of less than 0.5 mg/hour, and hemoglobin level remained normal at 12 g/dl, ruling out any hemorrhagic shock (Fig. 2). Platelet count progressively dropped to 47 G/L at 24 h following admission but then rapidly normalized, whereas hemostasis parameters (prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time ratio, fibrinogen; Fig. 3) were not altered, thereby excluding diagnosis of DIC. While LDH level rapidly rose from 1313 (10 N) to 3466 IU/L (16 N), reticulocyte count and haptoglobin level were measured once at 95 G/L and 1.64 g/l, respectively, and no schistocytes were detected on blood smear, ruling out TMA. Pregnancy test, antiphospholipid and ANCA antibodies were negative. Anti-DNA antibodies were titrated at 1/160 with no specificity. Serum levels of complement fraction C3 and C4 were normal. Testing for acquired thrombophilia (antithrombin III, protein S and C activity) was negative and testing for hereditary thrombophilia was not performed.

### Remimazolam alleviates hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury by activating FOXO1 / 3 signaling: remimazolam alleviates hepatic ischemia reperfusion injury [^7ad9ceab]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury (HIRI) refers to a condition where liver injury exacerbates upon the restoration of blood flow following a period of ischemia. It constitutes one of the crucial factors contributing to the augmented liver injury after liver surgeries like hepatectomy and liver transplantation. As per published literature, the absence of blood supply during ischemia instigates an imbalance between metabolic supply and demand, thereby generating an anoxic milieu within the liver tissue. Subsequently, blood reperfusion reoxygenates the tissue, culminating in more pronounced inflammation and oxidative stress. Compelling evidence has demonstrated that subduing inflammation and oxidative stress within the liver could alleviate HIRI. Currently, there remains a dearth of efficacious drugs for HIRI treatment. Hence, there is an urgent need to delve into antioxidant and anti-inflammatory mechanisms and to develop potent therapeutic drugs for addressing HIRI.

As previously documented, general anesthetics like sevoflurane have exhibited a remarkable capacity to ameliorate ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI). Remimazolam (RMZL), structurally categorized within the benzodiazepine family, is a safe and effective sedative. It is predominantly employed for the induction and maintenance of anesthesia and is considered a highly promising intravenous anesthetic agent. The mechanistic basis underlying RMZL’s sedative and anesthetic effects lies in its activation of GABA receptors. In prior studies, diazepam, a member of the benzodiazepine class, has been reported to confer beneficial effects by improving myocardial I/R injury and providing cardiac protection. Furthermore, recent reports suggested that RMZL could alleviate myocardial I/R injury via suppressing macrophage-mediated inflammation. Additionally, it has been demonstrated that RMZL played a protective role in cerebral IRI by inhibiting pyroptosis. More importantly, Weixing Ding et al. revealed that, at the cellular level, RMZL intervention in H/ R-induced LO2 cells could effectively reduce LO2 cell death and improve cell viability through targeting METTL3-mediated m6A modification of P53. Furthermore, Yanhua Shi et al. proposed that RMZL could assuage HIRI via inactivating the MAPK/ERK pathway. Although RMZL has been reported to have certain protective effects in I/R injury, there are have some defects such as an unclear dose-response relationship and obscure pharmacological mechanisms, which await further investigation.

### Sevoflurane (ultane) [^1284b8f6]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Sevoflurane is an inhalational anesthetic agent for use in induction and maintenance of general anesthesia. Minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) of sevoflurane in oxygen for a 40-year-old adult is 2.1%. The MAC of sevoflurane decreases with age (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION for details).

Pharmacokinetics

Uptake and Distribution

Solubility

Because of the low solubility of sevoflurane in blood (blood/gas partition coefficient @ 37°C = 0.63-0.69), a minimal amount of sevoflurane is required to be dissolved in the blood before the alveolar partial pressure is in equilibrium with the arterial partial pressure. Therefore, there is a rapid rate of increase in the alveolar (end-tidal) concentration (FA) toward the inspired concentration (FI) during induction.

Induction of Anesthesia

In a study in which seven healthy male volunteers were administered 70% N2O/30%O2for 30 minutes followed by 1.0% sevoflurane and 0.6% isoflurane for another 30 minutes the FA/FIratio was greater for sevoflurane than isoflurane at all time points. The time for the concentration in the alveoli to reach 50% of the inspired concentration was 4-8 minutes for isoflurane and approximately 1 minute for sevoflurane.

FA/FIdata from this study were compared with FA/FIdata of other halogenated anesthetic agents from another study. When all data were normalized to isoflurane, the uptake and distribution of sevoflurane was shown to be faster than isoflurane and halothane, but slower than desflurane. The results are depicted in Figure 3.

Recovery from Anesthesia

The low solubility of sevoflurane facilitates rapid elimination via the lungs. The rate of elimination is quantified as the rate of change of the alveolar (end-tidal) concentration following termination of anesthesia (FA), relative to the last alveolar concentration (FaO) measured immediately before discontinuance of the anesthetic. In the healthy volunteer study described above, rate of elimination of sevoflurane was similar compared with desflurane, but faster compared with either halothane or isoflurane. These results are depicted in Figure 4.

### Remimazolam alleviates hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury by activating FOXO1 / 3 signaling: remimazolam alleviates hepatic ischemia reperfusion injury [^8b492121]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Hepatic ischemia reperfusion injury (HIRI) frequently gives rise to aggravated liver damage. Currently, there exists a diverse range of anesthetic drugs that possess protective capabilities against ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI). Nevertheless, the specific functions and underlying mechanisms of remimazolam (RMZL) in HIRI have not been fully elucidated.

Methods

HIRI models of both hepatocytes and mice were successfully established. To evaluate liver function and injury, ELISA, HE and TUNEL staining were employed. The levels of oxidative stress markers and inflammatory factors were measured using commercial kits. Cell viability and apoptosis were measured by CCK-8 and flow cytometry, respectively. The abundance of genes and proteins was determined utilizing RT-qPCR and western blot.

Results

It was observed that RMZL administration greatly alleviated liver damage and repressed oxidative stress and inflammation in HIRI mouse models. In vitro experiments demonstrated that RMZL strongly protected LO2 cells from H/R-induced cell damage, oxidative stress, and inflammatory responses. Moreover, FOXO1 and FOXO3, which function as classic cell protection and anti-oxidative stress factors, were observed to be downregulated in liver tissue from HIRI mouse models and H/R-challenged LO2 cells. Notably, this downregulation could be reversed by the administration of RMZL. Furthermore, FOXO1 or FOXO3 knockdown abolished the protective effects of RMZL, including promoted cell survival and inhibited oxidative stress and inflammation in LO2 cells upon H/R exposure.

Conclusion

These data provided robust support for the notion that RMZL attenuated oxidative stress and inflammation to alleviate HIRI through enhancing FOXO1 and FOXO3 expressions, suggesting that RMZL holds great promise as a potential candidate anesthetic for HIRI treatment.

### The effect of cerium oxide on liver in sevoflurane-administered rats: an experimental study [^dc5a9ec5]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study investigated the protective effects of CeO₂ against liver damage induced by sevoflurane. The findings demonstrated that CeO₂ significantly reduced histopathological damage, particularly hydropic degeneration and neutrophil infiltration, in liver tissues. While AST and LDH levels were elevated in sevoflurane-administered rats, CeO₂ treatment mitigated these increases, although the reduction in AST was not statistically significant.

Sevoflurane has been considered a relatively safe anesthetic with low hepatotoxic potential. However, cases of hepatic necrosis and inflammation associated with its use suggest a multifactorial mechanism involving oxidative stress, immune reactions, and reactive metabolites like Compound A. These findings align with previous studies, such as those by Nikoll et al. who reported acute and chronic liver damage following exposure to volatile anesthetics.

Antioxidant agents like CeO₂ have garnered attention for their ability to scavenge free radicals and mitigate oxidative stress-related damage. Studies by Manne et al. and Amin et al. have demonstrated the efficacy of CeO₂ in reducing hepatic damage in ischemia-reperfusion and oxidative stress models. Similarly, the present study observed a significant reduction in LDH levels in the S + CeO₂ group compared to the sevoflurane-only group, suggesting a protective effect on hepatic cell membranes.

In this study, although the histopathological benefits of CeO₂ were evident, its effects on biochemical markers such as ALT and AST, as seen in some studies [,–], were less evident. This may be attributed to the relatively low hepatotoxic potential of sevoflurane and the limited duration of exposure in this study. The findings underscore the importance of histopathological evaluation alongside biochemical analysis to comprehensively assess hepatic damage.

The accumulation of CeO₂ in the liver and its stability at therapeutic doses suggest its suitability for mitigating oxidative stress in hepatic injury. However, conflicting reports regarding its potential hepatotoxicity at higher doses necessitate careful dose optimization. Future studies should investigate varying dosages, prolonged exposure durations, and subjects with pre-existing liver conditions to better understand the therapeutic potential of CeO₂ in clinical settings.

### Dexmedetomidine induces immunogenic cancer cell death and sensitizes tumors to PD-1 blockade [^abe0ac02]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Preclinical studies revealed that anesthetic agents can mediate anticancer effects by reducing the survival, proliferation and migration of malignant cells.Thus, local anesthetics and intravenous hypnotics such as propofol showed promising antineoplastic activities. These agents minimize tumor cell dissemination by inhibiting the production of angiogenic vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) as well as that of pro-metastatic matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-2, MMP-9) and E-cadherin.Both local anesthetics and propofol can stimulate intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways, interfere with cyclin-dependent kinases, or affect the epigenome of cancer cells.They also promote direct cytolytic effects on tumor cells by triggering different modalities of cell death such as apoptosis, ferroptosis and necrosis.Local anesthetics and propofol also suppress various oncogenic signaling pathways such as signaling transducer and activator of transcription 3/HOX antisense intergenic RNA, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase, extracellular signal-regulated kinases/mitogen-activated protein kinases, and phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K/Akt/mTOR).Moreover, local anesthetics and propofol directly act on immune effectors by favoring the proliferation of lymphocytes, maintaining the Th1/Th2 ratio, decreasing the action of immunosuppressive FoxP3 + CD4 + T regulatory cells (Tregs) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells, and diminishing the synthesis of protumor cytokines such as IL-6.Moreover, local anesthetics can control inflammatory pain and immunosuppressive glucocorticoid stress.After intratumoral injection of local anesthetics, dying cancer cells release danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) that recruit and stimulate dendritic cells (DCs) to engulf and present tumor antigens to T cells. Activated cytolytic T lymphocytes then kill residual circulating malignant cells and promote an immune memory that avoids recurrences. The combination with anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) antibodies potentiates this immune response, curing a fraction of mice bearing solid tumors.

### Lidocaine hydrochloride and epinephrine (lignospan standard) [^f08b8d4a]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

General

The safety and effectiveness of lidocaine depend on proper dosage, correct technique, adequate precautions and readiness for emergencies. Consult standard textbooks for specific techniques and precautions for various regional anesthetic procedures. Resuscitative equipment, oxygen and other resuscitative drugs should be available for immediate use (See WARNINGS AND ADVERSE REACTIONS).

The lowest dosage that results in effective anesthesia should be used to avoid high plasma levels and serious adverse effects. Repeated doses of lidocaine may cause significant increases in blood levels with each repeated dose due to slow accumulation of the drug or its metabolites. Tolerance to elevated blood levels varies with the status of the patient. Debilitated, elderly patients, acutely ill patients, and children should be given reduced doses commensurate with their age and physical condition.

If sedatives are employed to reduce patient apprehension, reduced doses should be used since local anesthetic agents, like sedatives, are central nervous system depressants which in combination may have an additive effect. Young children should be given minimal doses of each agent.

Lidocaine should be used with caution in patients with severe shock or heart block. Lidocaine should also be used with caution in patients with impaired cardiovascular function. Local anesthetic solutions containing a vasoconstrictor should be used with caution in areas of the body supplied by end arteries or having otherwise compromised blood supply. Patients with peripheral vascular disease and those with hypertensive vascular disease may exhibit exaggerated vasoconstrictor response. Ischemic injury (such as exfoliating or ulcerating lesions) or necrosis may result. Preparations containing a vasoconstrictor should be used with caution in patients during or following the administration of potent general anesthetic agents, since cardiac arrhythmias may occur under such conditions.

### Volatile sedation in critically ill adults undergoing mechanical ventilation: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^1835f099]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Comparison with previous literature

Unlike previous studies with inconclusive mortality findings, this meta-analysis is the first to demonstrate an increased risk of death associated with volatile sedation in mechanically ventilated critically ill patients. This result contrasts with growing clinical data suggesting potential benefits of volatile sedation, particularly in terms of lung protection. However, most earlier studies had fundamental limitations such as being single-center with small sample size, which precluded assessing clinically relevant outcomes like mortality.

The increased mortality observed in this meta-analysis was largely driven by the recent SESAR trial, which compared sevoflurane with propofol in patients with severe ARDS. However, our sensitivity analyses excluding the SESAR trial (e.g. focusing on surgical patients or isoflurane studies) yielded a similar point estimate, suggesting a potential harm of volatile sedation across different agent types and patient populations. Nonetheless, the TSA indicated that the current body of evidence remains insufficient to confirm or refute a detrimental effect of volatile sedation on mortality, warranting further evaluation in future RCTs.

Propofol was the most common comparator in the included studies, and a sensitivity analysis limited to those studies yielded similar results, further suggesting that volatile sedation may be harmful compared to propofol. In contrast to our findings, intraoperative volatile anesthesia, compared to propofol-based anesthesia, has been associated with improved outcomes in cardiac surgery. The much longer duration of administration in the ICU (days vs. hours in the operating theater) could have contributed to these contrasting results, although the underlying mechanisms remain uncertain.

Sevoflurane has been considered potentially nephrotoxic due to the formation of Compound A, a degradation product which may cause proximal tubular necrosis in a dose-dependent manner in animal models. However, this theoretical risk has not been confirmed in clinical studies involving critically ill patients. In our meta-analysis, the point estimate favored IV sedation over sevoflurane, mainly driven by the SESAR trial. Although prolonged use of sevoflurane may have played a role, the underlying mechanisms remain uncertain.

Previous meta-analyses have suggested that volatile sedation facilitate earlier extubation compared to IV sedation, which is consistent with our result. This reinforces the notion that volatile anesthetics enable faster recovery due to their pharmacokinetic properties. Unlike IV sedatives, which rely on hepatic and renal metabolism and accumulate in patients with severe hepatic or renal dysfunction, volatile anesthetics are eliminated via exhalation, allowing for more predictable drug clearance and titration.

Hepatic Impairment

A multicenter study (2 sites) compared the safety of sevoflurane and isoflurane in 16 patients with mild-to-moderate hepatic impairment utilizing the lidocaine MEGX assay for assessment of hepatocellular function. All patients received intravenous propofol (1-3 mg/kg) or thiopental (2-7 mg/kg) for induction and succinylcholine, vecuronium, or atracurium for intubation. Sevoflurane or isoflurane was administered in either 100% O2or up to 70% N2O/O2. Neither drug adversely affected hepatic function. No serum inorganic fluoride level exceeded 45 µM/L, but sevoflurane patients had prolonged terminal disposition of fluoride, as evidenced by longer inorganic fluoride half-life than patients with normal hepatic function (23 hours vs. 10-48 hours).

Renal Impairment

Sevoflurane was evaluated in renally impaired patients with baseline serum creatinine > 1.5 mg/dL. Fourteen patients who received sevoflurane were compared with 12 patients who received isoflurane. In another study, 21 patients who received sevoflurane were compared with 20 patients who received enflurane. Creatinine levels increased in 7% of patients who received sevoflurane, 8% of patients who received isoflurane, and 10% of patients who received enflurane. Because of the small number of patients with renal insufficiency (baseline serum creatinine greater than 1.5 mg/dL) studied, the safety of sevoflurane administration in this group has not yet been fully established. Therefore, sevoflurane should be used with caution in patients with renal insufficiency (see WARNINGS).

### Commentary: tolvaptan for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD)-an update [^36a43e76]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Drug-induced liver injury

Recommendation 25 : We recommend informing people taking tolvaptan of the risk of liver injury and encouraging them to self-report symptoms.

Recommendation 26 : We recommend withholding tolvaptan in the event of suspected drug-induced liver injury to allow time to exclude other causes. It is important to continue monitoring liver enzymes until they return to normal or the individual’s baseline.

Idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury (DILI) can occur after tolvaptan exposure, ranging from asymptomatic elevation in liver enzymes to acute liver failure. People taking tolvaptan should be informed of the potential signs and symptoms of liver injury, as these may develop between clinic visits. We recommend that best practice would be for healthcare teams to review patients with signs or symptoms of liver injury within 48 h.

In the TEMPO 3:4 trial, DILI was identified as a rare side effect with 1.2% of participants discontinuing the trial for this reason. In the extension TEMPO 4:4 trial, liver enzyme levels were monitored monthly for the first 18 months, during which no severe DILI cases were reported. It is important to note that elevated liver enzymes do not always correlate with the extent of liver damage. DILI is commonly defined using adjusted Hy’s law thresholds, characterised by alanine transferase (ALT) levels exceeding three times upper limit of normal and/or bilirubin levels exceeding twice the upper limit of normal in the absence of alternative causes. Timely recognition and withdrawal of tolvaptan is important when managing DILI. We have summarised a potential approach in Fig. 3.

All experiments were performed according to the European Community guiding principles in the care and use of animals (2010/63/UE, September 22, 2010), the local Ethics committee (CEEA26 CAP-Sud) guidelines, and the French decree no2013-118, February 1, 2013, on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes (JORF no0032, February 7, 2013, p 2199, text no 24). Animal experiments were approved by the French Ministry of Agriculture (agreements No14-027 and No2016-125-7914).

We induced a CTEPH model as previously described – in 7 large white male piglets aged 3 weeks at the initiation of the protocol. Premedication was achieved using intramuscular injection of an equimolar mixture of tiletamine and zolazepam (10 mg/kg) 30 minutes before the surgical procedure. General anesthesia was induced with an intravenous bolus of propofol (2 mg/kg) combined with administration of atracurium (2 mg/kg). Orotracheal intubation was established using a 7.5 mm probe to allow for mechanical ventilation (tidal volume of 6 mL/kg, positive end-expiratory pressure set at 5 cm H 2 O, and 40% of inspired oxygen fraction). General anesthesia was maintained using inhaled isoflurane (expiratory fraction from 1% to 4%) and buprenorphine (0.01 mg/kg boluses). The respiratory rate was adjusted to target an end-tidal CO 2 level between 35 and 40 mm Hg and oxygen saturation above 95%. Euthanasia will be performed by an anesthetic overdose of pentobarbital sodium (150 mg/kg IV).

To achieve CTEPH modeling, we performed ligation of the left pulmonary artery and iterative embolization of the right lower lobe once a week for 6 weeks, utilizing a biological glue (enbucrilate, Histoacryl; B.Braun, Melsungen, Germany) mixed with an equivalent volume of lipiodol. We injected 1 to 4 mL of enbucrilate–lipiodol solution each week into the right lower pulmonary artery through a venous catheter inserted percutaneously through the jugular vein under fluoroscopic control.

### Pirtobrutinib (Jaypirca) [^081aa796]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.6 Hepatotoxicity, Including Drug-Induced Liver Injury

Hepatotoxicity, including severe, life-threatening, and potentially fatal cases of drug-induced liver injury (DILI), has occurred in patients treated with Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors, including JAYPIRCA.

Evaluate bilirubin and transaminases at baseline and throughout treatment with JAYPIRCA. For patients who develop abnormal liver tests after JAYPIRCA, monitor more frequently for liver test abnormalities and clinical signs and symptoms of hepatic toxicity. If DILI is suspected, withhold JAYPIRCA. Upon confirmation of DILI, discontinue JAYPIRCA.

5.7 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity

Based on findings in animals, JAYPIRCA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproduction studies, administration of pirtobrutinib to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis caused embryo-fetal toxicity including embryo-fetal mortality and malformations at maternal exposures (AUC) approximately 3-times the recommended dose of 200 mg once daily. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with JAYPIRCA and for one week after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)].

### ONS / ASCO guideline on the management of antineoplastic extravasation [^042c185c]. JCO Oncology Practice (2025). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for extravasation of antineoplastic agents, more specifically with respect to indications for referral, ASCO/ONS 2025 guidelines recommend to consider performing a surgical referral or escalation of care for patients with central line extravasation of irritants with vesicant properties or vesicant antineoplastic agents, in addition to conservative management, rather than conservative management alone.

- recognize that high-risk populations, such as patients receiving DNA-binding vesicants, those with high-volume estimated extravasation, and those with National Cancer Institute CTCAE grade 2 (erythema associated with symptoms such as edema, pain, induration, and phlebitis), grade 3 (ulceration or necrosis; severe tissue damage), or grade 4 (life-threatening consequences) extravasation, may have a greater likelihood of benefiting from surgical referral or escalation in care.

### Volatile agents: when generalization doesn' T help [^a9e927fe]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

We read with interest the recent meta-analysis by Yamamoto et al. which pooled data from 21 randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The authors concluded that volatile sedation may increase mortality in mechanically ventilated critically ill adults compared to intravenous sedation. While the authors’ efforts are commendable, we believe the results should be interpreted with caution due to several methodological limitations that warrant further discussion.

First, the analysis included a heterogeneous mix of volatile agents: 12 studies with sevoflurane, 6 with isoflurane, 2 with either agent, and 1 with desflurane. The authors interpreted this diversity as a strength. However, we argue that it could be a methodological weakness contributing to confusion by the reader because these agents differ significantly in pharmacological properties and safety profiles. For example, isoflurane lacks the potential nephrotoxicity associated with prolonged sevoflurane use, which has led to recommendations limiting sevoflurane use in ICU settings outside clinical trials. In contrast, isoflurane is currently licensed for ICU sedation in Europe and it is under investigation in the USA. This approval was based on a trial reporting non-inferiority of isoflurane to propofol for ICU sedation in invasively ventilated adults.

Second, the pooled mortality data are markedly influenced by the SESAR trial, the largest RCT included, which only studied sevoflurane. This trial involved sedation for up to 7 days —longer than most prior studies— raising concerns about cumulative toxicity. Its strict inclusion criteria (patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS) limit generalizability. Also, a large variability in centers with experience on inhaled sedation may have impacted outcomes.

Third, as shown in Figure 2, the observed mortality appears mainly only in the sevoflurane subgroup —mainly driven by SESAR—while no significant difference is evident in studies using isoflurane. Additionally, none of included RCTs were designed to assess mortality as a primary outcome. In only two sevoflurane trials mortality was a secondary endpoint, and a key secondary endpoint in SESAR trial. In fact, the authors state that a definitive conclusion could not be drawn regarding the association between volatile sedation and increased mortality. Addressing confounding factors than can affect the assessment of mortality outcomes in ICU clinical trials requires careful trial design, standardized outcome definitions, transparent reporting of end-of-life decisions, appropriate statistical methods, and adequate sample size calculations.

### Pirfenidone capsule, 267 mg [^1e1a9da9]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Elevated Liver Enzymes and Drug-Induced Liver Injury

Cases of drug-induced liver injury (DILI) have been observed with pirfenidone. In the postmarketing period, non-serious and serious cases of DILI, including severe liver injury with fatal outcome, have been reported. Patients treated with pirfenidone 2403 mg/day in three Phase 3 trials had a higher incidence of elevations in ALT or AST ≥3×ULN than placebo patients (3.7% vs 0.8%, respectively). Elevations ≥10×ULN in ALT or AST occurred in 0.3% of patients in the pirfenidone 2403 mg/day group and in 0.2% of patients in the placebo group. Increases in ALT and AST ≥3×ULN were reversible with dose modification or treatment discontinuation.

Conduct liver function tests (ALT, AST, and bilirubin) prior to the initiation of therapy with pirfenidone, monthly for the first 6 months, every 3 months thereafter, and as clinically indicated. Measure liver function tests promptly in patients who report symptoms that may indicate liver injury, including fatigue, anorexia, right upper abdominal discomfort, dark urine, or jaundice. Dosage modification or interruption may be necessary for liver enzyme elevations [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.3)] .

5.2 Photosensitivity Reaction or Rash

Patients treated with pirfenidone 2403 mg/day in the three Phase 3 studies had a higher incidence of photosensitivity reactions (9%) compared with patients treated with placebo (1%). The majority of the photosensitivity reactions occurred during the initial 6 months. Instruct patients to avoid or minimize exposure to sunlight (including sunlamps), to use a sunblock (SPF 50 or higher), and to wear clothing that protects against sun exposure. Additionally, instruct patients to avoid concomitant medications known to cause photosensitivity. Dosage reduction or discontinuation may be necessary in some cases of photosensitivity reaction or rash [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].
