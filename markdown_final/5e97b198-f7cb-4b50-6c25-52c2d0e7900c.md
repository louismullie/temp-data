## Question

What is the free direct testosterone level?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the "free direct testosterone level" is, how it differs from total testosterone, why and when it matters clinically, how it should be measured, and what reference ranges are reasonable to use. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the biochemical definition and the free hormone hypothesis. Then, I should verify how it differs from total testosterone and why SHBG alters interpretation. Next, I will review when free testosterone adds diagnostic value and when it does not. After that, I need to check the best measurement methods and which assays to avoid. Finally, I will consider reference ranges, biological variation, and how to integrate symptoms with results in shared decision-making.

> Let me first confirm the biochemical definition. Free direct testosterone refers to the unbound fraction of circulating testosterone that is not bound to sex hormone–binding globulin or albumin, typically comprising about 2–4% of total testosterone, and it is the portion thought to be immediately available to target tissues according to the free hormone hypothesis, although that hypothesis remains debated in some circles [^113VMm27] [^117GN7s7].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about interchangeability with total testosterone. Total testosterone includes protein-bound and free fractions, so a low total testosterone does not automatically mean low free testosterone, especially when SHBG is altered; conversely, a normal total testosterone can mask low free testosterone when SHBG is high, which is why free testosterone can better reflect androgen status in certain contexts [^113VMm27] [^1148VoMF].

> I need to check when free testosterone meaningfully changes management. Guidelines converge on measuring free testosterone when total testosterone is borderline, typically around 200–400 ng/dL, or when SHBG is abnormal due to obesity, diabetes, aging, liver disease, thyroid disease, HIV, medications, or genetic variants, because these conditions can distort the relationship between total and free testosterone and lead to misclassification if only total testosterone is used [^116yTpN9] [^1148VoMF] [^114mNUJU] [^116kpqgV].

> Wait, let me verify the best measurement approach. Equilibrium dialysis followed by mass spectrometry is the gold standard for free testosterone, but it is technically complex, slow, and not widely available. Calculated free testosterone using total testosterone, SHBG, and albumin with a validated equation such as Vermeulen is acceptable when equilibrium dialysis is unavailable, whereas direct analog immunoassays for free testosterone are inaccurate and should not be used [^116y6JMr] [^114H7hYC] [^116yTpN9].

> I should double-check reference ranges before applying them. In healthy, nonobese men aged 18–39, directly measured free testosterone by equilibrium dialysis averages roughly 184–749 pmol/L, with a decline of about 4.5 pmol/L per year with aging and substantial reductions with higher BMI; some experts consider a lower limit of normal around 70–80 pg/mL (242–277 pmol/L) for calculated free testosterone when using harmonized total testosterone assays, but ranges vary by method and population, so results must be interpreted in clinical context [^116as4et].

> But wait, what if the patient has normal total testosterone and low free testosterone — does that matter? Observational data suggest men with normal total testosterone but low calculated free testosterone have more androgen-deficiency symptoms and worse health profiles than men with both normal, supporting the clinical relevance of free testosterone in selected cases, though causality cannot be inferred and decisions should still integrate symptoms and repeat testing [^114XFAuG] [^112fC7rm].

> I should confirm practical steps to reduce misclassification. Because testosterone shows diurnal and day-to-day variation and is suppressed by feeding, measure fasting total testosterone on two separate mornings using a reliable assay, and if results are borderline or SHBG is altered, add free testosterone by equilibrium dialysis or calculation; avoid testing during acute illness or when medications suppress testosterone, and interpret results against method-specific reference ranges rather than assuming universal cutoffs [^116yTpN9] [^111zq8AY] [^113icLgp] [^114fqwym].

> Let me reconsider the broader controversy so I don't overstate certainty. Some experts argue the free testosterone hypothesis is biologically flawed and that current free testosterone methods lack analytical validity, so they advocate relying on total testosterone plus SHBG interpretation; nonetheless, major guidelines still endorse selective use of free testosterone in the scenarios above, so shared decision-making that acknowledges uncertainty is prudent [^117GN7s7] [^114kbPD3] [^116yTpN9].

> In summary, free direct testosterone is the unbound fraction of circulating testosterone that is most clinically informative when total testosterone is borderline or SHBG is abnormal, best assessed by equilibrium dialysis when available or by calculated free testosterone otherwise, and interpreted alongside symptoms and repeat measurements rather than in isolation; while reference ranges vary, values below about 70–80 pg/mL in men are commonly considered low, but method and context must guide decisions [^116yTpN9] [^116as4et] [^112GmmLb].

---

Free direct testosterone is the **biologically active fraction** of testosterone that is not bound to sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) or albumin, representing about 2–3% of total testosterone [^113VMm27]. It is the most accurate marker of androgen status when SHBG is abnormal or total testosterone is borderline, and should be measured by **equilibrium dialysis** [^116y6JMr] or calculated from total testosterone, SHBG, and albumin [^116yTpN9]; direct immunoassays are inaccurate and not recommended [^116yTpN9]. Normal free testosterone in adult men is typically 70–80 pg/mL (242–277 pmol/L) [^112GmmLb], but reference ranges vary by method and population, so results must be interpreted in clinical context [^115HZETU].

---

## Definition and physiological significance

Free direct testosterone is the **unbound fraction** of testosterone in circulation, not attached to SHBG or albumin, and is considered the biologically active form that can diffuse into target tissues and exert androgenic effects [^113VMm27]. In contrast, total testosterone includes both free and protein-bound fractions, most of which are bound to SHBG and albumin and are not immediately available to tissues [^113VMm27].

---

## Measurement methods

Accurate assessment of free direct testosterone is critical for clinical decision-making. The following methods are commonly used:

| **Method** | **Description** | **Accuracy** | **Clinical recommendation** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Equilibrium dialysis | Gold standard method that separates free testosterone from protein-bound fractions using dialysis membranes | High | Recommended by guidelines [^116y6JMr] [^116yTpN9] |
| Calculation methods (e.g. Vermeulen equation) | Estimates free testosterone using total testosterone, SHBG, and albumin concentrations | Moderate | Acceptable alternative when equilibrium dialysis is unavailable [^116yTpN9] [^114H7hYC] |
| Direct immunoassays | Commercial assays that directly measure free testosterone | Low | Not recommended due to inaccuracy and poor reliability [^116yTpN9] [^114H7hYC] |

---

## Clinical indications for measurement

Free direct testosterone measurement is particularly indicated in the following clinical scenarios:

- **Borderline total testosterone**: When total testosterone levels are near the lower limit of normal (approximately 200–400 ng/dL) [^116yTpN9] [^1148VoMF].
- **Altered SHBG levels**: Conditions that affect SHBG concentration, such as obesity, diabetes, liver disease, or thyroid disorders [^116yTpN9] [^1148VoMF].
- **Symptomatic patients**: Men with symptoms of androgen deficiency but normal total testosterone levels [^114XFAuG] [^112fC7rm].

---

## Reference ranges and interpretation

Reference ranges for free direct testosterone vary depending on the measurement method and population studied. Commonly cited reference ranges for adult men include:

- **Equilibrium dialysis**: 70–80 pg/mL (242–277 pmol/L) [^112GmmLb].
- **Calculated free testosterone**: 66–272 pg/mL (229–943 pmol/L) [^112GmmLb].

These ranges are **method-specific** and may vary between laboratories; therefore, results should always be interpreted in the clinical context and in conjunction with total testosterone and SHBG levels [^115HZETU].

---

## Clinical implications of abnormal levels

Low free direct testosterone levels are associated with symptoms of androgen deficiency, including:

- **Sexual dysfunction**: Decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, and infertility [^notfound].
- **Physical symptoms**: Reduced muscle mass, fatigue, and decreased bone density [^notfound].
- **Psychological symptoms**: Depression, irritability, and cognitive impairment [^notfound].

Conversely, elevated free direct testosterone levels are uncommon but may be associated with androgen excess syndromes, such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in women or androgen-secreting tumors [^112ZNjwa].

---

## Limitations and considerations

Despite its clinical utility, free direct testosterone measurement has several limitations:

- **Assay variability**: Different laboratories use various methods, leading to variability in results and reference ranges [^115HZETU] [^117CM5GA].
- **Lack of standardization**: There is no universally accepted reference standard for free testosterone, complicating result interpretation [^114kbPD3].
- **Clinical context**: Results must always be interpreted in conjunction with clinical symptoms, total testosterone, and SHBG levels [^116yTpN9].

---

Free direct testosterone is the **biologically active fraction** of testosterone, and its measurement is essential in specific clinical scenarios. Equilibrium dialysis is the gold standard, but calculated methods are acceptable alternatives. Interpretation must consider method-specific reference ranges and the clinical context.

Serum Free Testosterone Assessments

Accurate assessment of serum free testosterone might be helpful when serum total testosterone concentration approximates the lower limit of normal or when abnormalities in sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) are suspected (Table 2; Fig. 1). A fasting early morning total testosterone concentration of > 350 ng/dL (12 nmol/L) measured by a reliable assay is generally consistent with a normal serum free testosterone and typically does not require assessment of free testosterone except in men with suspected or proven high SHBG concentrations (see below). The most common causes of the constellation of a low serum total testosterone, low serum SHBG, and normal free serum testosterone (ie, pseudohypogonadism; Fig. 1) are obesity and T2D (Table 2).

Table 2.
Causes of high and low circulating SHBG

There are no well-validated, outcome-based normal reference ranges for serum free testosterone concentration in older men. In addition, there is wide variation in the quality and the various methods used to measure or calculate serum free testosterone concentrations. Direct methods of measurement of free testosterone are inaccurate and should not be used.

Diagnosing testosterone deficiency requires accurate and precise measurement of total testosterone levels by an accurate method, such as liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in a laboratory certified by an accuracy-based program (eg, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Hormone Standardization (HoST) Program), and, if needed, free testosterone level. Free testosterone level should ideally be measured by equilibrium dialysis method. Testosterone levels should be measured in 2 or more fasting samples obtained in the morning. Harmonized reference ranges for total testosterone can be applied to laboratories that certified by the HoST Program.

### Low free testosterone and prostate cancer risk: a collaborative analysis of 20 prospective studies [^112La594]. European Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Experimental and clinical evidence implicates testosterone in the aetiology of prostate cancer. Variation across the normal range of circulating free testosterone concentrations may not lead to changes in prostate biology, unless circulating concentrations are low. This may also apply to prostate cancer risk, but this has not been investigated in an epidemiological setting.

Objective

To examine whether men with low concentrations of circulating free testosterone have a reduced risk of prostate cancer.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Analysis of individual participant data from 20 prospective studies including 6933 prostate cancer cases, diagnosed on average 6.8 yr after blood collection, and 12 088 controls in the Endogenous Hormones, Nutritional Biomarkers and Prostate Cancer Collaborative Group.

Outcome Measurements and Statistical Analysis

Odds ratios (ORs) of incident overall prostate cancer and subtypes by stage and grade, using conditional logistic regression, based on study-specific tenths of calculated free testosterone concentration.

Results and Limitations

Men in the lowest tenth of free testosterone concentration had a lower risk of overall prostate cancer (OR = 0.77, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.69–0.86; p < 0.001) compared with men with higher concentrations (2nd-10th tenths of the distribution). Heterogeneity was present by tumour grade (p het = 0.01), with a lower risk of low-grade disease (OR = 0.76, 95% CI 0.67–0.88) and a nonsignificantly higher risk of high-grade disease (OR = 1.56, 95% CI 0.95–2.57). There was no evidence of heterogeneity by tumour stage. The observational design is a limitation.

Conclusions

Men with low circulating free testosterone may have a lower risk of overall prostate cancer; this may be due to a direct biological effect, or detection bias. Further research is needed to explore the apparent differential association by tumour grade.

Patient Summary

In this study, we looked at circulating testosterone levels and risk of developing prostate cancer, finding that men with low testosterone had a lower risk of prostate cancer.

### Optimizing diagnostic accuracy and treatment decisions in men with testosterone deficiency [^112VkCBb]. Endocrine Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

This narrative review offers a guideline-based approach for optimizing diagnostic evaluation and treatment decision making in men being evaluated for testosterone deficiency.

Methods

A narrative review.

Results

Testosterone deficiency is a clinical syndrome that results from the inability of the testes to produce normal amounts of testosterone and is characterized by a constellation of symptoms and signs associated with consistently low testosterone concentrations. The diagnosis of testosterone deficiency is made by the ascertainment of symptoms and signs; the measurement of total and, if indicated, free testosterone levels in early-morning fasting samples on ≥ 2 days; the measurement of luteinizing hormone and follicular-stimulating hormone levels to distinguish primary from secondary hypogonadism; and an additional evaluation to ascertain the cause of testosterone deficiency. Nonspecificity of symptoms and signs, variations in testosterone levels over time, inaccuracy in the measurement of total and free testosterone levels, variations in binding protein concentrations, and suboptimal reference ranges contribute to diagnostic inaccuracy. Testosterone treatment is indicated for men with symptomatic testosterone deficiency. Testosterone treatment should be avoided in men with prostate or breast cancer, erythrocytosis, thrombophilia, increased risk of prostate cancer or severe lower urinary tract symptoms without prior urologic evaluation, a recent major adverse cardiovascular event, uncontrolled heart failure, or severe untreated sleep apnea. Testosterone replacement therapy should be accompanied by a standardized monitoring plan.

Conclusion

A shared decision of the patient and physician to treat should be guided by the consideration of the burden of symptoms, potential benefits and risks, patient's values, and the cost and burden of long-term treatment and monitoring.

### Testosterone therapy in men with hypogonadism: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^11798Y7c]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To update the "Testosterone Therapy in Men With Androgen Deficiency Syndromes" guideline published in 2010.

Participants

The participants include an Endocrine Society-appointed task force of 10 medical content experts and a clinical practice guideline methodologist.

Evidence

This evidence-based guideline was developed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach to describe the strength of recommendations and the quality of evidence. The task force commissioned two systematic reviews and used the best available evidence from other published systematic reviews and individual studies.

Consensus Process

One group meeting, several conference calls, and e-mail communications facilitated consensus development. Endocrine Society committees and members and the cosponsoring organization were invited to review and comment on preliminary drafts of the guideline.

Conclusions

We recommend making a diagnosis of hypogonadism only in men with symptoms and signs consistent with testosterone (T) deficiency and unequivocally and consistently low serum T concentrations. We recommend measuring fasting morning total T concentrations using an accurate and reliable assay as the initial diagnostic test. We recommend confirming the diagnosis by repeating the measurement of morning fasting total T concentrations. In men whose total T is near the lower limit of normal or who have a condition that alters sex hormone-binding globulin, we recommend obtaining a free T concentration using either equilibrium dialysis or estimating it using an accurate formula. In men determined to have androgen deficiency, we recommend additional diagnostic evaluation to ascertain the cause of androgen deficiency. We recommend T therapy for men with symptomatic T deficiency to induce and maintain secondary sex characteristics and correct symptoms of hypogonadism after discussing the potential benefits and risks of therapy and of monitoring therapy and involving the patient in decision making. We recommend against starting T therapy in patients who are planning fertility in the near term or have any of the following conditions: breast or prostate cancer, a palpable prostate nodule or induration, prostate-specific antigen level > 4 ng/mL, prostate-specific antigen > 3 ng/mL in men at increased risk of prostate cancer (e.g. African Americans and men with a first-degree relative with diagnosed prostate cancer) without further urological evaluation, elevated hematocrit, untreated severe obstructive sleep apnea, severe lower urinary tract symptoms, uncontrolled heart failure, myocardial infarction or stroke within the last 6 months, or thrombophilia. We suggest that when clinicians institute T therapy, they aim at achieving T concentrations in the mid-normal range during treatment with any of the approved formulations, taking into consideration patient preference, pharmacokinetics, formulation-specific adverse effects, treatment burden, and cost. Clinicians should monitor men receiving T therapy using a standardized plan that includes: evaluating symptoms, adverse effects, and compliance; measuring serum T and hematocrit concentrations; and evaluating prostate cancer risk during the first year after initiating T therapy.

### Approach to the patient: the evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^115qUems]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

A free testosterone result is most useful in the assessment of a man with intermediate pretest probability of hypogonadism, a condition associated with low serum SHBG and a serum total testosterone that is moderately low to low-normal (ie, 200–275 ng/dL or 6.94–9.55 nmol/L). Some experts discourage the measurement of free testosterone because of the limitations discussed above, and these experts recommend focusing on the interpretation of total testosterone concentrations in conjunction with SHBG concentrations. However, this approach is congruent with assessment of serum free testosterone with an accurate method. Overall, there is no consistent evidence that free testosterone concentrations are a better measure of androgen status than total testosterone. Further studies to help establish more accurate and uniform methods of assessing free testosterone concentrations and to determine its clinical utility for the diagnosis of hypogonadism are needed. For further discussion about the debate over the clinical value of free testosterone and the accuracy of its calculation/measurement, there are several recent reviews.

Some hypogonadal men with markedly elevated serum SHBG concentrations may have normal or even high serum total testosterone concentrations. Significantly elevated serum SHBG concentrations occur most commonly in the setting of anti-epileptic treatment, chronic liver disease, or chronic daily ingestion of large quantities of alcohol (even in the absence of significant elevation of serum hepatic transaminases) (Table 2). Marked SHBG elevations leading to misleadingly normal or even high total testosterone are relatively uncommon, whereas pseudohypogonadism in men with diabetes and/or obesity is very common.

### Low free testosterone and prostate cancer risk: a collaborative analysis of 20 prospective studies [^117GQs7n]. European Urology (2018). Low credibility.

4 Discussion

Our results indicate that men in the lowest study-specific tenth of calculated free testosterone concentration have a 23% reduced risk of prostate cancer compared with men with higher concentrations. Above this very low concentration, prostate cancer risk did not change with increasing free testosterone concentration. We also found evidence that this association varied by tumour grade. This is the largest collection of data on hormones and prostate cancer risk available, and is the first large-scale prospective evidence supporting an association between low free testosterone concentrations and prostate cancer risk.

The observed association between low free testosterone and lower prostate cancer risk may be due to a direct biological effect. Across the normal range of circulating free testosterone concentrations, stimulation of prostatic androgen receptors may remain relatively constant, due to stable intraprostatic DHT concentrations and/or saturation of androgen receptors. Therefore, variation across the normal range of circulating free testosterone concentrations may not be associated with a prostate cancer risk. However, when circulating concentrations are very low, reduced androgen receptor signalling may lead to a reduction in prostate cancer risk.

### British Society for Sexual Medicine guidelines on adult testosterone deficiency, with statements for UK practice [^116kpqgV]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for male hypogonadism, more specifically with respect to testosterone levels, BSSM 2017 guidelines recommend to repeat total testosterone measurement on two or more occasions by a reliable method. Obtain measurement of free testosterone in patients with levels close to the lower normal range (8–12 nmol/L) or with suspected or known abnormal SHBG levels.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for male hypogonadism, more specifically with respect to testosterone levels, EAA 2020 guidelines recommend to measure or calculate free testosterone in addition to total testosterone in patients with conditions altering sex hormone-binding globulin and when total testosterone concentrations are in the borderline range (~8–12 nmol/L) if the clinical suspicion of hypogonadism is strong.

### Testosterone assays [^114Cpe8q]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Challenges to the accurate and precise measurement of testosterone include deficiencies in standardization, variable reference ranges, expenses related to gold standard equipment, and other challenges. Total testosterone remains the most accessible for standard laboratories, while free testosterone and bioavailable testosterone may be useful adjuncts, particularly in men with low borderline testosterone values. Mass spectrometry is the gold standard measurement modality for total testosterone, while equilibrium dialysis followed by direct assessment with a trusted method is the gold standard technique for measuring free testosterone. Although reference ranges may vary, efforts to adapt reference ranges to different populations include age-adjusted values.

### Position statement: utility, limitations, and pitfalls in measuring testosterone: an endocrine society position statement [^117Jf8AB]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of the study was to evaluate the current state of clinical assays for total and free testosterone.

Participants

The five participants were appointed by the Council of The Endocrine Society and charged with attaining the objective using published data and expert opinion.

Evidence

Data were gleaned from published sources via online databases (principally PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, Google Scholar), the College of American Pathologists, and the clinical and laboratory experiences of the participants.

Consensus Process

The statement was an effort of the committee and was reviewed in detail by each member. The Council of The Endocrine Society reviewed a late draft and made specific recommendations.

Conclusions

Laboratory proficiency testing should be based on the ability to measure accurately and precisely samples containing known concentrations of testosterone, not only on agreement with others using the same method. When such standardization is in place, normative values for total and free testosterone should be established for both genders and children, taking into account the many variables that influence serum testosterone concentration.

### Current practices of measuring and reference range reporting of free and total testosterone in the United States [^115HZETU]. The Journal of Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

The evaluation and management of male hypogonadism should be based on symptoms and on serum testosterone levels. Diagnostically this relies on accurate testing and reference values. Our objective was to define the distribution of reference values and assays for free and total testosterone by clinical laboratories in the United States.

Materials and Methods

Upper and lower reference values, assay methodology and source of published reference ranges were obtained from laboratories across the country. A standardized survey was reviewed with laboratory staff via telephone. Descriptive statistics were used to tabulate results.

Results

We surveyed a total of 120 laboratories in 47 states. Total testosterone was measured in house at 73% of laboratories. At the remaining laboratories studies were sent to larger centralized reference facilities. The mean ± SD lower reference value of total testosterone was 231 ± 46 ng/dl (range 160 to 300) and the mean upper limit was 850 ± 141 ng/dl (range 726 to 1,130). Only 9% of laboratories where in-house total testosterone testing was performed created a reference range unique to their region. Others validated the instrument recommended reference values in a small number of internal test samples. For free testosterone 82% of laboratories sent testing to larger centralized reference laboratories where equilibrium dialysis and/or liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry was done. The remaining laboratories used published algorithms to calculate serum free testosterone.

Conclusions

Reference ranges for testosterone assays vary significantly among laboratories. The ranges are predominantly defined by limited population studies of men with unknown medical and reproductive histories. These poorly defined and variable reference values, especially the lower limit, affect how clinicians determine treatment.

### Testosterone reference ranges in normally cycling healthy premenopausal women [^114S9A3U]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

At present, there are no well-accepted reference ranges for serum testosterone concentrations in women.

Aim

The aim of this study was to determine the reference ranges for serum testosterone and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) in premenopausal women with normal menstrual cycles.

Methods

We measured serum total, free, and bioavailable testosterone and SHBG concentrations in 161 healthy, normally cycling women (18–49 years). Morning blood samples were collected during follicular, mid-cycle, and luteal phases of the menstrual cycle and analyzed using validated methods. Mean, median, and weighted average hormone levels across menstrual cycle phases as well as percentiles for a typical 30-year-old woman were determined.

Main Outcome Measures

Age-related serum levels of total, free, and bioavailable testosterone and SHBG levels in normally cycling premenopausal women.

Results

Serum testosterone concentrations exhibited an age-related decline, whereas SHBG remained relatively stable across studied age ranges. Reference ranges for total, free, and bioavailable testosterone and SHBG were established using 5th and 95th percentiles. The estimated 5th and 95th percentiles for a 30-year-old woman were: testosterone, 15–46 ng/dL (520–1595 pmol/L); free testosterone, 1.2–6.4 pg/mL (4.16–22.2 pmol/L); calculated free testosterone, 1.3–5.6 pg/mL (4.5–19.4 pmol/L); bioavailable testosterone, 1.12–7.62 ng/dL (38.8–264.21 pmol/L); and SHBG 18–86 nmol/L. The variations of hormones and SHBG across menstrual cycle were consistent with previous literature.

Conclusions

Reference ranges for free, total, and bioavailable testosterone and SHBG were established in premenopausal women using validated immunoassays and an adequate number of subjects consistent with recommendations by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards. The increase in testosterone in the mid-cycle period is relatively small compared with the overall variability, so these reference ranges can be applied irrespective of the day in the menstrual cycle the sample has been taken.

### Guideline-discordant care among direct-to-consumer testosterone therapy platforms… [^111k2ggb]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

eAppendix. Secret Shopper Script eTable 1. Laboratory Tests Requested on Intake by Each Platform eTable
2. Secret Shopper's Laboratory Values and Reported Reference Ranges. million in the US, several new DTC testosterone therapy platforms have emerged. 2, 3 However, unlike pharmacotherapy for erectile dysfunction and androgenic alopecia, testosterone is a Class III controlled substance associated with increased risk of infertility, polycythemia, and possibly cardiovascular events, with the latter prompting multiple safety communications from the US Food and Drug Administration. 4 Given the potential risks of testosterone therapy, we sought to examine whether DTC platforms provide appropriate, guideline-concordant care for testosterone therapy. The initial consultation was conducted by a nurse practitioner, physician assistant, or nonmedically licensed individual.

Despite reporting normal total testosterone levels and normal free testosterone levels and desiring fertility, the secret shopper was offered testosterone therapy by 6 of 7 platforms. Only 1 of 7 platforms inquired about recent cardiovascular events or desire for future fertility. Criteria for offering testosterone therapy were discordant with both Endocrine Society and American Urological Association guidelines — 1 platform offered treatment only for men with total testosterone levels below 450 ng/dL, whereas the remaining 6 platforms had no total testosterone threshold for treatment initiation. Half of the platforms offering testosterone therapy stated a treatment goal of total testosterone levels of 1000 ng/dL or more and did not discuss the fertility risks of testosterone therapy, and 5 of 6 did not discuss risks of polycythemia.

The secret shopper was offered a broad range of off-label medications in addition to testosterone therapy. This cross-sectional study found that DTC platforms offered testosterone therapy and off-label therapies to men not meeting guideline-based criteria for testosterone deficiency, in some cases guided by nonmedically licensed individuals with unclear oversight, while failing to convey the risks and benefits of testosterone therapy. As DTC testosterone therapy increases in popularity, patients and clinicians should be educated about the potential pitfalls of these platforms.

### Are declining testosterone levels a major risk factor for ill-health in aging men? [^116mBpod]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2008). Low credibility.

As men grow older, testosterone levels fall, with a steeper decline in unbound or free testosterone compared with total testosterone concentrations. Lower testosterone levels have been associated with poorer cognitive function, and with impaired general and sexual health in aging men. Recently, lower testosterone levels have been linked with metabolic syndrome and type II diabetes, both conditions associated with cardiovascular disease, and shown to predict higher overall and cardiovascular-related mortality in middle-aged and older men. However, reverse causation has to be considered, as systemic illness may result in reduced testosterone levels. Thus, the strength of these associations and the likely direction of causation need to be carefully considered. Furthermore, these conditions may overlap, for example aging, lower testosterone levels, erectile dysfunction and cardiovascular disease are interrelated. Cross-sectional and longitudinal observational studies may be informative. However, ultimately randomized controlled trials of testosterone therapy are needed to clarify its role in the maintenance of general and sexual health in aging men. Testosterone therapy should be considered in hypogonadal men who meet rigorous criteria for the diagnosis of androgen deficiency. Additional consideration should be given to designing and testing interventions that may prevent or ameliorate the age-related decline in testosterone levels in men.

### Testosterone therapy in adult men with androgen deficiency syndromes: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^113EYWFv]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective was to provide guidelines for the evaluation and treatment of androgen deficiency syndromes in adult men.

Participants

The Task Force was composed of a chair, selected by the Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee of The Endocrine Society, five additional experts, a methodologist, and a professional writer. The Task Force received no corporate funding or remuneration.

Evidence

The Task Force used systematic reviews of available evidence to inform its key recommendations. The Task Force used consistent language and graphical descriptions of both the strength of recommendation and the quality of evidence, using the recommendations of the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation group.

Consensus Process

Consensus was guided by systematic reviews of evidence and discussions during three group meetings, several conference calls, and e-mail communications. The drafts prepared by the panelists with the help of a professional writer were reviewed successively by The Endocrine Society's Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee, Clinical Affairs Committee, and Council. The version approved by the Council was placed on The Endocrine Society's web site for comments by members. At each stage of review, the Task Force received written comments and incorporated needed changes.

Conclusions

We recommend making a diagnosis of androgen deficiency only in men with consistent symptoms and signs and unequivocally low serum testosterone levels. We suggest the measurement of morning total testosterone level by a reliable assay as the initial diagnostic test. We recommend confirmation of the diagnosis by repeating the measurement of morning total testosterone and in some patients by measurement of free or bioavailable testosterone level, using accurate assays. We recommend testosterone therapy for symptomatic men with androgen deficiency, who have low testosterone levels, to induce and maintain secondary sex characteristics and to improve their sexual function, sense of well-being, muscle mass and strength, and bone mineral density. We recommend against starting testosterone therapy in patients with breast or prostate cancer, a palpable prostate nodule or induration or prostate-specific antigen greater than 3 ng/ml without further urological evaluation, erythrocytosis (hematocrit > 50%), hyperviscosity, untreated obstructive sleep apnea, severe lower urinary tract symptoms with International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) greater than 19, or class III or IV heart failure. When testosterone therapy is instituted, we suggest aiming at achieving testosterone levels during treatment in the mid-normal range with any of the approved formulations, chosen on the basis of the patient's preference, consideration of pharmacokinetics, treatment burden, and cost. Men receiving testosterone therapy should be monitored using a standardized plan.

### Society for endocrinology clinical practice guideline for the evaluation of androgen excess in women [^115eVKHH]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Medium credibility.

6.3.3 Calculated Free Testosterone (cFT)

cFT accounts for both the binding capacity of SHBG for testosterone and the serum albumin concentration. It exhibits superior agreement with equilibrium dialysis measurements of free testosterone over a wide range of SHBG concentrations making it more robust than FAI. This has been borne out in a recent meta‐metanalysis which determined cFT to exhibit slightly superior diagnostic sensitivity than the FAI.

Recommendations
Evaluate an index of free testosterone on females being investigated for hyperandrogenaemia, particularly if total testosterone is normal in a patient with clinical androgen excess.
If using the FAI, results should be interpreted with caution if the patient has an SHBG concentration < 30 nmol/L.
All results should be interpreted against evidence‐based reference ranges. These should be categorised as either age‐specific and/or pre‐ and post‐menopausal.

### Debate about the free testosterone hypothesis: useful tool or misguided mirage? [^117GN7s7]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

In this debate, two clinicians discuss the merits and demerits of the free testosterone hypothesis. Although most clinical guidelines recommend the measurement of free testosterone in the evaluation for male hypogonadism (at least in men with suspected low serum sex hormone binding globulin), there remains controversy about underlying hypothesis that serum free testosterone is a significant contributor to androgen effect. In this debate, Dr. Anawalt presents evidence to support the free testosterone hypothesis and advocates for the usefulness of accurate assessment of free testosterone in the evaluation of male hypogonadism. Dr. Handelsman argues that the evidence is unconvincing, the hypothesis is flawed and biologically invalid, and free testosterone cannot be accurately assessed in clinical practice.

### Age-stratified reference ranges for directly measured serum free testosterone in community-dwelling and healthy men [^116as4et]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Context

Direct measurement of serum free testosterone (FT) may help evaluate hypogonadism in men. However, up to present, availability of reference ranges for measured FT (mFT) is limited.

Objective

To establish age-stratified reference ranges for mFT in healthy and community-dwelling adult men.

Methods

Serum samples of 1202 Caucasian men were collected from large population cohort studies. Free testosterone was measured using equilibrium dialysis followed by liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Sex-hormone binding globulin was measured using immunoassay and total testosterone was measured using LC-MS/MS. Reference ranges per age decade and for men aged 18 to 39 years with BMI < 30 kg/m² were established following Clinical & Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines. Reference ranges were established as the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles.

Results

The reference range for mFT in healthy, non-obese men aged 18 to 39 years was 184–749 pmol/L. mFT levels showed a decrease with aging of -4.5 pmol/L per year. Having a BMI of 30 kg/m² and 35 kg/m² resulted in a decrease in mFT of 14.4% and 22.2%, respectively, compared to a reference BMI of 22 kg/m².

Conclusion

This study provides age-stratified reference ranges for mFT in adult men, established in the largest cohort to date, using published methodology. Our results also show that mFT levels are influenced by age and BMI. Future work should focus on whether age-stratified or reference ranges for young men should be employed, and how mFT can best be implemented in clinical practice including the improved application of calculated FT.

### Evaluation and management of testosterone deficiency: AUA guideline [^117SnUAd]. The Journal of Urology (2018). Medium credibility.

AUA Guideline — testosterone therapy dosing target — 22. Clinicians should adjust testosterone therapy dosing to achieve a total testosterone level in the middle tertile of the normal reference range. (Conditional Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C). The goal of testosterone therapy is the normalization of total testosterone levels combined with improvement in symptoms or signs, and the Panel recommends using the minimal dosing necessary to drive testosterone levels to the normal physiologic range of 450–600 ng/dL, which is the middle tertile of the normal range for most laboratories; the Panel notes that age-adjustments may be required, but from a practical standpoint, 450–600 ng/dL represents a viable range for all age-groups, and achieving testosterone levels in this window should ameliorate any symptoms that are genuinely associated with testosterone deficiency.

### Assays of serum testosterone [^113JVWBA]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of male hypogonadism depends on an assessment of the clinical signs and symptoms of hypogonadism and serum testosterone level. Current clinical laboratory testosterone assay platforms include immunoassays and mass spectrometry. Despite significant advances to improve the accuracy and precision of the currently available assays, limited comparability exists between assays at the lower and upper extremes of the testosterone range. Because of this lack of comparability, there is no current gold standard assay for the assessment of total testosterone levels.

Are there normal values and treatment targets?

As testosterone is measured by a variety of methods with different reference standards, it is not possible to establish a universal reference range for premenopausal women. Historically, the adequacy of serum testosterone therapy targeting premenopausal values was estimated using the free androgen index (FAI) with assessment of morning total testosterone (T) and SHBG. These values were "plugged into" the equation to calculate the FAI as follows: FAI = 100 × [Total T (ng/dL)]/SHBG (nmol/l)]. The concentration of free or bioavailable testosterone was approximated, but this approach has limitations as it assumes predictable binding of testosterone to SHBG at all concentrations.

An attempt to extend this method for determination of a discriminatory level correlated to sexual function and dysfunction was published by Guay et al. in 2004. They studied 60 healthy, menstruating women not on hormonal contraception, ages 20–49 years, without sexual dysfunction as assessed by a validated questionnaire and detailed interview. RIA measurements of morning testosterone, SHBG, and multiple other androgens were assayed; the FAI was calculated. Based on this small cohort, these investigators proposed a clinically useful range of the normal androgen profile in women without sexual dysfunction.

The applicability of this method in clinical practice is limited given today's alternatives for several reasons: (1) the small sample sizes of the original publications, (2) insufficient accuracy and precision of RIA testosterone measurements, (3) the availability of better methodology for clinical use, and (4) an improved understanding of the binding characteristics of testosterone in serum across the entire range spectrum.

Why should testosterone be measured?

Although there are limitations with total testosterone measurement in clinical practice, the Global Position Statement and this consensus panel recommend total testosterone as the best available measure, rather than free or bioavailable testosterone or the FAI. Therapy should not target total testosterone concentrations that exceed those of premenopausal women. There is no definitive testosterone cutoff level to identify women with sexual dysfunction including HSDD. There is no blood level that is a treatment goal for testosterone therapy, as serum concentrations do not predict treatment efficacy. The main reasons to measure testosterone are (1) to exclude women with midrange to high values (according to the assay used) that would suggest against androgen levels being associated with the patient's symptoms and (2) to monitor testosterone therapy to ensure against supraphysiological values and associated androgen excess side effects.

### Low free testosterone and prostate cancer risk: a collaborative analysis of 20 prospective studies [^1146sjTB]. European Urology (2018). Low credibility.

1 Introduction

Experimental and clinical evidence implicates testosterone in the aetiology of prostate cancer. Nearly all metastatic prostate tumours overexpress the androgen receptor, and androgen deprivation therapy is the mainstay treatment approach for many prostate tumours. Two large randomised controlled trials of 5α-reductase inhibitors (which block the conversion of testosterone to the more biologically active dihydrotestosterone [DHT]) showed a reduction in prostate cancer risk. Genome-wide association studies and animal models also support an association between androgens and risk.

Despite the strong biological evidence of an association between testosterone concentration and prostate cancer risk, previous epidemiological studies have not found evidence of an association. This may be because the association is nonlinear; variations across the normal range of circulating testosterone may not lead to alterations in prostate growth because the stimulation of prostatic androgen receptors may remain relatively constant, due to relatively constant intraprostatic DHT concentrations and/or saturation of the androgen receptors. However, when the supply of testosterone to the prostate is abnormally low, prostate growth may decrease. Therefore, we hypothesised that men with very low circulating testosterone concentrations may have a reduced risk of prostate cancer but that, above these low concentrations, prostate cancer risk is not associated with further increases in circulating testosterone concentrations. Less than 2% of testosterone circulates unbound to carrier proteins or "free", and is able to pass out of the blood into the prostate tissue; therefore, the focus of our analysis was on free testosterone.

The Endogenous Hormones, Nutritional Biomarkers and Prostate Cancer Collaborative Group (EHNBPCCG) is a pooled individual participant dataset of prospective studies and prostate cancer risk. A previous analysis by this group found no association between prediagnostic androgen concentrations and prostate cancer. However, this dataset has since been expanded to include almost double the number of prostate cancer cases and now comprises 20 prospective studies with a total of 6933 cases and 12 088 matched controls with calculated free testosterone data. This large dataset now provides sufficient power to examine whether men with very low concentrations of circulating free testosterone have a reduced risk of prostate cancer.

### Testosterone therapy in men with hypogonadism: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^115q6JoB]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis of men with suspected hypogonadism — Endocrine Society guideline: 1.1 We recommend diagnosing hypogonadism in men with symptoms and signs of testosterone deficiency and unequivocally and consistently low serum total testosterone and/or free testosterone concentrations (when indicated). Testosterone concentrations exhibit significant diurnal and day-to-day variations and may be suppressed by food intake or glucose. Therefore, clinicians should measure total testosterone concentrations on two separate mornings when the patient is fasting. Clinicians should use an accurate and reliable method, optimally, an assay that has been certified by an accuracy-based standardization or quality control program [e.g. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Hormone Standardization Program for Testosterone]. In men who have conditions that alter sex hormone–binding globulin (SHBG) (Table 2), or whose initial total testosterone concentrations are at or near the lower limit of the normal range (Fig. 1), clinicians should determine free testosterone concentrations either directly from equilibrium dialysis assays or by calculations that use total testosterone, SHBG, and albumin concentrations. Clinicians should not use direct analog-based free testosterone immunoassays, as they are inaccurate. Clinicians should not test men for testosterone deficiency who have or are recovering from an acute illness or are engaged in short-term use of medications (e.g., opioids) that suppress testosterone concentrations.

Endocrine Society testosterone therapy guideline — diagnosis, testing, and initial treatment for male hypogonadism states that we recommend making a diagnosis of hypogonadism only in men with symptoms and signs consistent with testosterone (T) deficiency and unequivocally and consistently low serum T concentrations. We recommend measuring fasting morning total T concentrations using an accurate and reliable assay as the initial diagnostic test, and we recommend confirming the diagnosis by repeating the measurement of morning fasting total T concentrations. In men whose total T is near the lower limit of normal or who have a condition that alters sex hormone–binding globulin, we recommend obtaining a free T concentration using either equilibrium dialysis or estimating it using an accurate formula, and in men determined to have androgen deficiency, we recommend additional diagnostic evaluation to ascertain the cause of androgen deficiency. We recommend T therapy for men with symptomatic T deficiency to induce and maintain secondary sex characteristics and correct symptoms of hypogonadism.

A systematic approach to diagnose hypogonadism initially establishes the presence of symptoms/signs of testosterone deficiency, considers other potential causes of manifestations, and excludes conditions that transiently suppress testosterone. Hypogonadism is confirmed by measuring fasting serum total testosterone in the morning on at least 2 separate days, or free testosterone by equilibrium dialysis or calculated free testosterone in men with conditions that alter sex hormone-binding globulin or serum total testosterone near lower limit of normal. To guide management, further evaluation is performed to identify the specific cause of hypogonadism and whether it is potentially reversible or an irreversible pathologic disorder.

### Testosterone therapy in men with androgen deficiency syndromes: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^114N7HCt]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

Our objective was to update the guidelines for the evaluation and treatment of androgen deficiency syndromes in adult men published previously in 2006.

Participants

The Task Force was composed of a chair, selected by the Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee of The Endocrine Society, five additional experts, a methodologist, and a medical writer. The Task Force received no corporate funding or remuneration.

Conclusions

We recommend making a diagnosis of androgen deficiency only in men with consistent symptoms and signs and unequivocally low serum testosterone levels. We suggest the measurement of morning total testosterone level by a reliable assay as the initial diagnostic test. We recommend confirmation of the diagnosis by repeating the measurement of morning total testosterone and, in some men in whom total testosterone is near the lower limit of normal or in whom SHBG abnormality is suspected by measurement of free or bioavailable testosterone level, using validated assays. We recommend testosterone therapy for men with symptomatic androgen deficiency to induce and maintain secondary sex characteristics and to improve their sexual function, sense of well-being, muscle mass and strength, and bone mineral density. We recommend against starting testosterone therapy in patients with breast or prostate cancer, a palpable prostate nodule or induration or prostate-specific antigen greater than 4 ng/ml or greater than 3 ng/ml in men at high risk for prostate cancer such as African-Americans or men with first-degree relatives with prostate cancer without further urological evaluation, hematocrit greater than 50%, untreated severe obstructive sleep apnea, severe lower urinary tract symptoms with International Prostate Symptom Score above 19, or uncontrolled or poorly controlled heart failure. When testosterone therapy is instituted, we suggest aiming at achieving testosterone levels during treatment in the mid-normal range with any of the approved formulations, chosen on the basis of the patient's preference, consideration of pharmacokinetics, treatment burden, and cost. Men receiving testosterone therapy should be monitored using a standardized plan.

We recommend against routine screening of men in the general population for hypogonadism. In men who have hypogonadism, we recommend distinguishing between primary (testicular) and secondary (pituitary–hypothalamic) hypogonadism by measuring serum luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone concentrations. In men with hypogonadism, we suggest further evaluation to identify the etiology of hypothalamic, pituitary, and/or testicular dysfunction.

Free testosterone (FT) assessment — indications and methods: Clinicians should measure FT in men who have conditions that alter sex hormone–binding globulin (SHBG) and should also measure FT when serum total testosterone (TT) is modestly above or below the lower limit of normal (e.g., 200 to 400 ng/dL); in men with TT far below normal (e.g., < 150 ng/dL), measuring FT is generally not necessary. Local laboratories usually do not have accurate and reliable assays for FT measurement; therefore, clinicians should use a reliable reference laboratory. Clinicians should measure FT using the equilibrium dialysis method performed under standardized conditions; if equilibrium dialysis is not available, clinicians should estimate FT using a formula that calculates FT from TT, SHBG, and albumin concentrations. Direct tracer analog immunoassays for FT are inaccurate and should not be used.

### Androgen supplementation in older women: too much hype, not enough data [^116SmDPE]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2002). Low credibility.

Androgen supplementation in women has received enormous attention in the scientific and lay communities. That it enhances some aspects of cognitive function, sexual function, muscle mass, strength, and sense of well-being is not in question. What is not known is whether physiological testosterone replacement can improve health-related outcome in older women without its virilizing side effects. Although it is assumed that the testosterone dose-response relationship is different in women than in men and that clinically relevant outcomes on the above-mentioned effects can be achieved at lower testosterone doses, these assumptions have not been tested rigorously. Androgen deficiency has no clear-cut definition. Clinical features may include impaired sexual function, low energy, depression, and a total testosterone level of less than 15 ng/dL, the lower end of the normal range. Measurement of free testosterone is ideal, because it provides a better estimate of the biologically relevant fraction. It is not widely used in clinical practice, because some methods of measuring free testosterone assay are hampered by methodological difficulties. In marked contrast to the abrupt decline in estrogen and progesterone production at menopause, serum testosterone is lower in older women than in menstruating women, with the decline becoming apparent a decade before menopause. This article reviews testosterone's effects on sexual function, cognitive function, muscle mass, body composition, and immune function in postmenopausal women.

### The clinical management of testosterone replacement therapy in postmenopausal women with hypoactive sexual desire disorder: a review [^113EbLzR]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Calculating free testosterone as well as obtaining SHBG can be helpful in patients that have total testosterone levels in the upper range of physiologic levels without symptomatic improvement in HSDD symptoms. There are several free bioavailable testosterone online calculators utilizing total testosterone and SHBG values. Measurement of 5α-reductase should be considered in patients without clinical improvement in symptoms found to have normal total testosterone and free testosterone. In the scenarios of low free testosterone or decreased 5αreductase, experts have supported total testosterone levels higher than physiologic testosterone.

Once levels are stable, testosterone concentrations should be monitored every 4–6 months. If testosterone therapy results in improvement of HSDD, a drug holiday should be considered after 6–12 months of treatment to see if treatment is still required. If there is a decline in symptoms after cessation of testosterone, therapy should then be resumed long-term to maintain the improvement in HSDD. Testosterone treatment should be discontinued if there is no clinical improvement noted by the patient after 6 months.

### Maximal testosterone suppression in prostate cancer – free vs total testosterone [^1122aVaz]. Urology (2014). Low credibility.

Testosterone remains a key target in the treatment of advanced prostate cancer. The relationship of free testosterone to prostate cancer treatment and outcomes remains largely unexplored. A consensus of prostate cancer experts was convened in 2013 to review current knowledge surrounding relationship of total and free testosterone to prostate cancer, discuss the free hormone hypothesis, and highlight future avenues for therapeutics. Free testosterone may better reflect prostate cancer tissue androgen levels than serum total testosterone concentration. Free testosterone deserves more research regarding its relation to clinical outcomes.

### Evaluation and management of testosterone deficiency: AUA guideline [^113uQvHM]. The Journal of Urology (2018). Medium credibility.

American Urological Association (AUA) testosterone reference ranges and interpretation — due to methodological challenges there is considerable variability in testosterone reference ranges; as an example, a total testosterone value of 250 ng/dL may be considered low based on the current guideline but normal by a laboratory because reference laboratories often define normal as the 5th (or 2.5th) to the 95th (or 97.5th) percentiles. As the literature uses absolute values to define low testosterone, the absolute value is ultimately the most important factor to determine which patients may expect to achieve benefits with testosterone therapy, and in cases of discrepancy between laboratory reference ranges and this guideline, clinicians are recommended to utilize the absolute value, acknowledging variability across labs including CDC-certified LCMS.

### Approach to the patient: low testosterone concentrations in men with obesity [^114kbPD3]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Free Testosterone

Free testosterone, whether measured or calculated using equilibrium binding or empirical equations, is advocated by some experts to appraise androgen status in certain circumstances. However, such recommendations are based on observational data and received wisdom rather than objective evidence from controlled clinical testing and therefore in our opinion add nothing useful to the clinical evaluation. The free testosterone hypothesis, which asserts that free testosterone is the most biologically active moiety of testosterone, is conceptually flawed in that unbound testosterone is equally accessible to sites of degradation as it is to target tissues, so there is no logical basis to claim it is more (rather than less) biologically active. In addition, reference laboratory dialysis-based measurements of free testosterone are nonrobust, costly, and rarely available. Most laboratories report calculations based on formulae incorporating serum testosterone and SHBG measurements. However, such calculations are consistently inaccurate relative to dialysis-based measurements due to assumptions such as using SHBG mass as a substitute for SHBG binding capacity, the use of 4 different nonharmonized SHBG immunoassays, and the use of 5 different empirical estimates of testosterone-SHBG binding affinity. Furthermore, free testosterone is not a valid analytical variable, as it lacks a certified reference standard, violating a fundamental principle of analytical chemistry requiring comparison of like with like. As a result, free testosterone lacks sufficient quality controls required to form reference ranges or compare results from 1 center/laboratory to another.

### Wide variability in laboratory reference values for serum testosterone [^117CM5GA]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Introduction

The laboratory determination of testosterone levels consistent with a diagnosis of hypogonadism is complicated by the availability of multiple testosterone assays and varying reference ranges.

Aim

To assess current laboratory practices regarding availability of testosterone assays and use of reference values.

Methods

A telephone survey of 12 academic, 12 community medical laboratories, and one national laboratory.

Main Outcome Measures

Types of androgen assays offered and determination of reference values.

Results

All of the academic and eight of the community centers performed total testosterone testing. Free testosterone was performed in-house by six of the 12 academic and one community center. Testing for bioavailable testosterone, free androgen index, and percent free testosterone was performed in-house by no more than two centers. There were eight and four different assays used for total and free testosterone, respectively. One national laboratory offered equilibrium dialysis measurement of free testosterone. Of the 25 labs, there were 17 and 13 different sets of reference values for total and free testosterone, respectively. The low reference value for total testosterone ranged from 130 to 450 ng/dL (350% difference), and the upper value ranged from 486 to 1,593 ng/dL (325% difference). Age-adjusted reference values were applied in four centers for total testosterone and in seven labs for free testosterone. All reference values were based on a standard statistical model without regard for clinical aspects of hypogonadism. Twenty-three of the 25 lab directors responded that clinically relevant testosterone reference ranges would be preferable to current standards.

Conclusions

Laboratory reference values for testosterone vary widely, and are established without clinical considerations.

### Menstrual cycle-related changes in circulating androgens in healthy women with self-reported normal sexual function [^115VsaBs]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Introduction

There is currently neither a clinically useful, reliable and inexpensive assay to measure circulating levels of free testosterone (T) in the range observed in women, nor is there agreement on the serum free T threshold defining hypoandrogenism that is associated with female-impaired sexual function.

Aim

Following the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines, we generated clinically applicable ranges for circulating androgens during specific phases of the menstrual cycle in a convenience sample of 120 reproductive-aged, regularly cycling healthy European Caucasian women with self-reported normal sexual function.

Methods

All participants were asked to complete a semistructured interview and fill out a set of validated questionnaires, including the Female Sexual Function Index, the Female Sexual Distress Scale, and the 21-item Beck's Inventory for Depression. Between 8 am and 10 am, a venous blood sample was drawn from each participant during the midfollicular (day 5 to 8), the ovulatory (day 13 to 15), and the midluteal phase (day 19 to 22) of the same menstrual cycle.

Main Outcome Measures

Serum levels of total and free testosterone, Delta(4)-androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate and sex hormone-binding globulin during the midfollicular, ovulatory and midluteal phase of the same menstrual cycle.

Results

Total and free T levels showed significant fluctuations, peaking during the ovulatory phase. No significant variation during the menstrual cycle were observed for Delta(4)-androstenedione and dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate. Despite the careful selection of participants that yielded an homogeneous group of women without sexual disorders, we observed a wide range of distribution for each of the circulating androgens measured in this study.

Conclusions

This report provides clinically applicable ranges for androgens throughout the menstrual cycle in reproductive-aged, regularly cycling, young healthy Caucasian European women with self-reported normal sexual function.

### Approach to the patient: the evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^112GmmLb]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

A recent study in 145 healthy nonobese men aged 19 years or older using a standardized method with mass spectrometry after equilibrium dialysis has reported a reference range for free testosterone of 66 to 309 pg/mL (229–1070 pmol/L); further validation is required, and equilibrium dialysis is currently not widely available. Equilibrium dialysis is the gold standard measure of free testosterone, but its methodology is complex and expensive, so it has limited availability worldwide. In practice, free testosterone is usually calculated by empiric formulae that have some pitfalls, but generally correlate reasonably well with values determined by equilibrium dialysis. There is some controversy about the best formula for estimating free testosterone concentrations. The Vermeulen formula is the most commonly used formula in clinical practice and trials, and it correlates reasonably well with measurement by equilibrium dialysis. If a validated, accurate and harmonized total testosterone assay (with a normal range of 264–916 ng/dL or 9.16–31.8 nmol/L) is used to measure serum total testosterone, then a calculated serum free testosterone provides a reasonable estimation of serum free testosterone. Assuming these conditions are met, then a lower limit of normal of 70 to 80 pg/mL pg/mL (242–277 pmol/L) is likely to be clinically reasonable. Using the limit of normal of 70 to 80 pg/mL pg/mL (242–277 pmol/L) that is higher than the lower limit of normal of 66 pg/mL (229 pmol/L) demonstrated by the above study by Jasuja helps to limit the overdiagnosis of hypogonadism to men who are not likely to benefit from typical replacement dosages of testosterone therapy.

### Testosterone therapy in men with hypogonadism: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^1148VoMF]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Medium credibility.

Endocrine Society guideline — conditions in which measurement of free testosterone (FT) concentration is recommended include those with decreased sex hormone–binding globulin (SHBG) concentrations (obesity, diabetes mellitus, use of glucocorticoids, some progestins, and androgenic steroids, nephrotic syndrome, hypothyroidism, acromegaly, polymorphisms in the SHBG gene), those with increased SHBG concentrations (aging, HIV disease, cirrhosis and hepatitis, hyperthyroidism, use of some anticonvulsants, use of estrogens, polymorphisms in the SHBG gene), and total testosterone (TT) concentrations in the borderline zone around the lower limit of the normal range (e.g., 200–400 ng/dL).

### Performance of total testosterone measurement to predict free testosterone for the biochemical evaluation of male hypogonadism [^116p18DP]. The Journal of Urology (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

Guidelines recommend serum total testosterone measurement as the initial test to evaluate male hypogonadism, reserving free testosterone assessment for men with suspected sex hormone-binding globulin abnormalities or total testosterone near the lower limit of normal. We determined the performance of total testosterone measurement as a test to identify men with normal vs low free testosterone.

Materials and Methods

We examined the electronic medical records of all 3,672 men evaluated for hypogonadism by a serum testosterone panel, including total testosterone, sex hormone-binding globulin, albumin and calculated free testosterone, from January 1, 1997 through December 31, 2007 in a network that serves veterans in Washington.

Results

The sensitivity and specificity of low total testosterone (less than 280 ng/dl) to rule out and predict low calculated free testosterone was 91.0% and 73.7%, respectively. At thresholds of less than 350 and less than 400 ng/dl the sensitivity of total testosterone for low calculated free testosterone increased to 96.8% and 98.2%, and at thresholds of less than 150 and less than 200 ng/dl specificity increased to 98.9% and 92.6%, respectively.

Conclusions

Total testosterone between 280 and 350 ng/dl is not sensitive enough to reliably exclude hypogonadism. Total testosterone must exceed 350 to 400 ng/dl to reliably predict normal free testosterone. Except when levels are less than 150 ng/dl total testosterone measurement has low specificity for the biochemical diagnosis of hypogonadism.

### Clinical practice update on testosterone therapy for male hypogonadism: contrasting perspectives to optimize care [^111WJUkJ]. Clinical Endocrinology (2019). Medium credibility.

US Endocrine Society (ES) published a clinical practice guideline on testosterone therapy in men with hypogonadism, and Endocrine Society of Australia (ESA) a position statement on management of male hypogonadism. Both emphasize the importance of diagnosing men who are androgen deficient due to organic (classical or pathological) hypogonadism arising from disorders of the hypothalamus, pituitary or testes, who assuredly benefit from testosterone therapy. Both recognize that men with an intact gonadal axis may have low testosterone concentrations, for instance older men or men with obesity or other medical comorbidities. ES guidelines classify such symptomatic men as having organic (advanced age) or functional (obesity, medical comorbidities) hypogonadism, giving an option for testosterone therapy as a shared decision between clinicians and individual patients. ESA did not recommend testosterone therapy in these men. ES offers a reference range for total testosterone established in young men, while ESA cites age-standardized reference ranges. ES recommends using free testosterone as well as total testosterone to identify men with hypogonadism in conditions where sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) is altered, or when total testosterone is borderline. ESA recommends confirmatory biochemical testing with total testosterone, recognizing that this may be lower than expected if SHBG concentrations are low. Both emphasize the importance of identifying pre-existing prostate and cardiovascular disease prior to initiating testosterone therapy, with ES providing specific recommendations for PSA measurement, deferring testosterone therapy after major cardiovascular events and indications for pituitary imaging. These contrasting approaches highlight gaps in the evidence base where individualized patient management is required.

### Low free testosterone is associated with hypogonadal signs and symptoms in men with normal total testosterone [^114XFAuG]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Context

During aging, total testosterone (TT) declines and SHBG increases, resulting in a greater decrease in calculated free T (cFT). Currently, guidelines suggest using TT to diagnose androgen deficiency and to reserve cFT only for men with borderline TT.

Objective

Our objective was to investigate if either low cFT or low TT is more strongly associated with androgen-related clinical endpoints.

Methods

A total of 3334 community-dwelling men, aged 40–79 years, were included in this study. Differences in clinical variables between the referent group of men with both normal TT (≥ 10.5 nmol/liter) and normal cFT (≥ 220 pmol/liter) with those who had normal TT/low cFT, low TT/normal cFT, and low TT/low cFT were assessed by regression models adjusted for age, center, body mass index, and comorbidities.

Results

A total of 2641 men had normal TT (18.4 ± 5.5 [mean ± SD] nmol/liter)/normal cFT (326 ± 74 pmol/liter), 277 men had normal TT (14.2 ± 3.7)/low cFT (194 ± 23), 96 men had low TT (9.6 ± 0.7)/normal cFT (247 ± 20), and 320 men had low TT (7.8 ± 2.5)/low cFT (160 ± 55). Men with normal TT/low cFT were older and in poorer health. They had higher SHBG and LH and reported more sexual and physical symptoms, whereas hemoglobin and bone ultrasound parameters were lower compared to the referent group. Men with low TT/normal cFT were younger and more obese. They had lower SHBG, but LH was normal, whereas features of androgen deficiency were lacking.

Conclusions

Low cFT, even in the presence of normal TT, is associated with androgen deficiency-related symptoms. Normal cFT, despite low TT, is not associated with cognate symptoms; therefore, cFT levels should be assessed in men with suspected hypogonadal symptoms.

### Testosterone therapy in men with hypogonadism: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^113VMm27]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Medium credibility.

Endocrine Society guideline — serum total testosterone (TT) definition, binding, and clinical implications: Serum TT concentration represents the sum of unbound and protein-bound T in circulation, most T is bound to SHBG and albumin and only 2.0% to 4.0% is unbound or free; "bioavailable T" refers to unbound T plus albumin-bound T, and the free hormone hypothesis states that biologic activity depends on free hormone concentrations. Analysis of European Male Ageing Study data showed that men with low FT concentrations had sexual and physical symptoms consistent with T deficiency regardless of their TT, whereas men with low TT but normal FT were more obese and did not have associated sexual or physical symptoms.

### The significance of biological variation in the diagnosis of testosterone deficiency, and consideration of the relevance of total, free and bioavailable testosterone determinations [^116nFE2H]. The Journal of Urology (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose

The diagnosis of testosterone deficiency syndrome is based on clinical manifestations and documentation of low testosterone. Which biochemical tests to use and the importance of morning sampling are still controversial. Biological variation (including interindividual and intraindividual biological variation) must be considered when interpreting individual results as it determines the usefulness of reference intervals and the change (reference change value) necessary for a significant difference between results.

Materials and Methods

A total of 87 healthy men (50 to 70+ years old) provided blood in the morning of the first day, and 4 weeks later in the morning and afternoon. Samples were frozen (-70C) and analyzed in the same run for serum testosterone, sex hormone-binding globulin and albumin, and bioavailable testosterone and free testosterone were calculated.

Results

Serum testosterone was lower in the afternoon by 1.5 nmol/l (43 ng/dl, p < 0.05), with larger changes observed with higher morning values. However, this diurnal effect was dwarfed by the normal biological variation observed for repeat morning samples (serum testosterone ± 4 nmol/l [115 ng/dl]). Between day intra-individual biological variation for morning serum testosterone was 18.7% while within day intra-individual biological variation was 12.9%. A change of 52% (reference change value) is necessary between serial morning results to confirm a significant difference. The biological variation parameters of calculated bioavailable testosterone and calculated free testosterone confer no advantage over total testosterone.

Conclusions

Marked individuality of serum testosterone is evident even in healthy men. Because intraindividual biological variation is less than interindividual biological variation, reference intervals are marginally useful. The homeostatic set point of a patient could decrease by half and still be within the reference interval. Prospective establishment of an individual's baseline over repeated measurements or symptoms regardless of serum testosterone concentration should be used to guide clinical decisions.

### Standardising the biochemical confirmation of adult male hypogonadism: a joint position statement by the society for endocrinology and association of clinical biochemistry and laboratory medicine [^114fqwym]. Clinical Endocrinology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Inter-assay variation between different immunoassays and different mass spectrometry methods hampers the biochemical confirmation of male hypogonadism. Furthermore, some laboratories utilise assay manufacturer reference ranges that do not necessarily mirror assay performance characteristics, with the lower limit of normality ranging from 4.9 nmol/L to 11 nmol/L. The quality of the normative data underlying commercial immunoassay reference ranges is uncertain.

Design

A working group reviewed published evidence and agreed upon standardised reporting guidance to augment total testosterone reports.

Results

Evidence-based guidance on appropriate blood sampling, clinical action limits, and other major factors likely to affect the interpretation of results are provided.

Conclusions

This article aims to improve the quality of the interpretation of testosterone results by non-specialist clinicians. It also discusses approaches for assay harmonisation which have been successful in some but not all healthcare systems.

### Androgens and diabetes in men: results from the third national health and nutrition examination survey (NHANES III) [^113gXMH4]. Diabetes Care (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

Low levels of androgens in men may play a role in the development of diabetes; however, few studies have examined the association between androgen concentration and diabetes in men in the general population. The objective of this study is to test the hypothesis that low normal levels of total, free, and bioavailable testosterone are associated with prevalent diabetes in men.

Research Design and Methods

The study sample included 1,413 adult men aged ≥ 20 years who participated in the morning session of the first phase of the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a cross-sectional survey of the civilian, noninstitutionalized population of the U.S. Bioavailable and free testosterone levels were calculated from serum total testosterone, sex hormone-binding globulin, and albumin concentrations.

Results

In multivariable models adjusted for age, race/ethnicity, and adiposity, men in the first tertile (lowest) of free testosterone level were four times more likely to have prevalent diabetes compared with men in the third tertile (odds ratio 4.12 [95% CI 1.25–13.55]). Similarly, men in the first tertile of bioavailable testosterone also were approximately four times as likely to have prevalent diabetes compared with men in the third tertile (3.93 [1.39–11.13]). These associations persisted even after excluding men with clinically abnormal testosterone concentrations defined as total testosterone < 3.25 ng/ml or free testosterone < 0.07 ng/ml. No clear association was observed for total testosterone after multivariable adjustment (P for trend across tertiles = 0.27).

Conclusions

Low free and bioavailable testosterone concentrations in the normal range were associated with diabetes, independent of adiposity. These data suggest that low androgen levels may be a risk factor for diabetes in men.

Recommendations

I. Measurement of testosterone, female sexual dysfunction, and endogenous androgen levels

(1) Recommendations pertaining to the measurement of circulating testosterone in women Testosterone may act directly via the androgen receptor/nongenomic androgenic action, or by reduction to the more potent androgen dihydrotestosterone and/or aromatization to estradiol and their metabolites. Testosterone concentrations decline during the reproductive years (Level IIB). Testosterone concentrations appear to be maintained in women beyond the age of 65 years, but whether this confers a benefit is yet to be understood (Level IIB). Total testosterone can be measured with high accuracy and reproducibility using liquid/gas chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry assays (Grade B). Direct assays for the measurement of total and free testosterone are highly unreliable in the female range (Grade A). Reference laboratories should be "harmonized" with biological standards in coordination with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Expert Opinion). Measurement of testosterone using direct assays in clinical practice is appropriate, if liquid/gas chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry assay is not available, to exclude high baseline concentrations and also to exclude supraphysiological concentrations during treatment (Expert Opinion). Current research into testosterone physiology and clinical effects should mainly focus on measuring total testosterone as the main biomarker rather than "free" testosterone because evidence that "free" testosterone is the biologically active testosterone fraction is lacking (Expert Opinion).

(2) Recommendations for the terminology for female sexual dysfunction (FSD) Hypoactive sexual desire disorder/dysfunction (HSDD) and female sexual arousal disorder (FSAD) are distinct conditions that should be categorized separately when considering the impact of androgens on their clinical presentation and response to treatment (Grade B). Although HSDD and FSAD overlap, they have distinct etiologies, risk factors, clinical features, and responses to psychological and biological interventions (Grade B). Traditional specifiers (i.e. lifelong vs acquired; generalized vs situational) should be retained and used to further categorize and stratify treatments for HSDD and other female sexual disorders/dysfunctions. The diagnosis of HSDD in clinical practice should be based on thorough clinical assessment guided by available diagnostic criteria such as the International Society for the Study of Women's Sexual Health or the International Classification of Diseases, 11th edition (Expert Opinion).

Monitoring of testosterone-replacement therapy — evaluation and laboratory schedule: In hypogonadal men who have started testosterone therapy, we recommend evaluating the patient after treatment initiation to assess whether the patient has responded to treatment, is suffering any adverse effects, and is complying with the treatment regimen (Ungraded Good Practice Statement). Clinicians should maintain serum testosterone concentrations during treatment in the mid-normal range for healthy young men, evaluate symptoms and formulation-specific adverse events at each visit, and measure testosterone and hematocrit at 3 to 6 months, at 12 months, and annually thereafter; for those who choose prostate monitoring, include PSA and DRE 3 to 12 months.

### Adult-onset hypogonadism [^115PfHKj]. Mayo Clinic Proceedings (2016). Medium credibility.

Sex hormone–binding globulin (SHBG) and testosterone (T) measurement — adult-onset hypogonadism: Approximately 40% to 50% of the circulating T in men is SHBG-bound, and the Endocrine Society recommendation states clinicians may choose to calculate free T using total T, SHBG, and albumin when specialized measurement technologies are unavailable. In men with AOH, SHBG may be low, especially with obesity, insulin resistance, or diabetes; in such men the free or bioavailable T may be normal while total T is low and the patient may not be T deficient, so a low total T alone may overdiagnose AOH and free or bioavailable T may better reflect gonadal status. Men with conditions that may lower SHBG should be evaluated using an assay for free or bioavailable T, with methods that include ammonium sulfate precipitation of SHBG-bound T, equilibrium dialysis, or a mass action equation based on total T and SHBG; by contrast, direct analog assays for free T are inaccurate and are not recommended.

### Blood testosterone threshold for androgen deficiency symptoms [^112Sp4X3]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2004). Low credibility.

There are few systematic studies of the relationship between blood testosterone concentrations and the symptoms of overt androgen deficiency. Because most testosterone preparations are relatively short-term, the rapid changes in blood testosterone concentrations they cause make it difficult to define any testosterone threshold. By contrast, subdermal testosterone implants provide stable blood testosterone concentrations over days to weeks, while gradually declining to baseline over 5–7 months. Hence, this provides an opportunity to define a blood testosterone threshold for androgen deficiency symptoms by observing androgen-deficient men as their familiar androgen deficiency symptoms return as testosterone pellets slowly dissolve. Among 52 androgen-deficient men who underwent 260 implantations over 5 yr, at the time of return of androgen deficiency symptoms the blood total and free testosterone concentrations were highly reproducible within individuals (F = 0.8, P = 0.49 and F = 1.4, 0.24, respectively) but varied markedly between men (F = 167 and F = 138, both P < 0.001), indicating that each person had a consistent testosterone threshold for androgen deficiency symptoms that differed markedly between individuals. The most reported symptoms of androgen deficiency were lack of energy, lack of motivation, and reduced libido. The symptomatic threshold was significantly lower in men with secondary hypogonadism compared with men with primary or mixed hypogonadism (total, 9.7 ± 0.5 nmol/liter vs. 11.7 ± 0.4 nmol/liter and 10.2 ± 0.3 nmol/liter, P = 0.006; free, 146 ± 10 pmol/liter vs. 165 ± 6 pmol/liter and 211 ± 18 pmol/liter, P = 0.002) but was not affected by the underlying cause of hypogonadism or by specific symptoms of any severity. Despite a wide range in individual thresholds for androgen deficiency symptoms, the mean blood testosterone threshold corresponded to the lower end of the eugonadal reference range for young men. The implications of these observations for the development of more specific quality-of-life measures, as well as for other potential androgen deficiency states such as chronic diseases and aging, remain to be determined.

### Comment on: wehr et al. low free testosterone levels are associated with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in postmenopausal diabetic women. diabetes care 2011; 34: 1771–1777 [^114d3yPw]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

We have read with immense interest the recent article by Wehr et al. showing that low free testosterone concentrations in postmenopausal diabetic women are associated with increased all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. We wish to comment on the concentrations of total and free testosterone of the study subjects. The overall mean or median total and free testosterone concentrations were not mentioned. However, according to quartiles based on free testosterone, the mean free testosterone was 0.93 ng/mL (equivalent to 93 ng/dL). The total testosterone at the intersection of second and third quartiles was 2.44 nmol/L (70 ng/dL). Since free testosterone is generally a small fraction (1–5%) of total testosterone, one or both of these concentrations are incorrect. The total and free testosterone concentrations in postmenopausal women are usually less than 20 ng/dL and 0.4 ng/dL, respectively. This is important for practitioners who will want to put the findings of this article in a clinical perspective. We would like to know which of the quartiles relate to subnormal testosterone concentrations in postmenopausal women.

Most assays for measurement of total testosterone have poor accuracy at the low levels that exist in women. Can the authors comment on the lower limit of detection of the assay used to measure testosterone in their study?

The study subjects were divided into quartiles based on their free testosterone concentrations. There was a higher prevalence of diabetes in the higher quartiles. In the subpopulation of diabetic women, the subjects were also divided into free testosterone quartiles. Since the free testosterone concentration range in each quartile was the same in overall population as well as in women with diabetes, we wonder if the "quartiles" of diabetic women were actually four groups that contained an unequal number of women. We would expect that the groups with higher free testosterone concentrations would have a higher number of women. Can the authors provide the number of women in each diabetic group in Table 2?

The authors had coronary angiography findings on all subjects. The prevalence of coronary artery disease was similar across the quartiles of free testosterone. However, the severity of coronary artery disease is not specified. Was the severity of coronary artery disease different across the quartiles to account for the differences in clinical outcomes?

Information on the above-mentioned issues would help readers interpret the findings of this article more clearly and to put the data in the right perspective.

### American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists medical guidelines for clinical practice for the evaluation and treatment of hypogonadism in adult male patients – 2002 update [^116RNQSy]. Endocrine Practice (2004). Low credibility.

In these clinical practice guidelines, specific recommendations are made for determining the most effective methods of diagnosing and treating hypogonadism in adult male patients. The target populations for these guidelines include the following: (1) men with primary testicular failure requiring testosterone replacement (hypergonadotropic hypogonadism); (2) male patients with gonadotropin deficiency or dysfunction who may have received testosterone replacement therapy or treatment for infertility (hypogonadotropic hypogonadism); and (3) aging men with symptoms relating to testosterone deficiency who could benefit from testosterone replacement therapy. Initial hormonal evaluation generally consists of a testosterone determination, in conjunction with a free testosterone or sex hormone-binding globulin level, inpatients with clear symptoms and signs but normal-range total testosterone, follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, and prolactin levels. Other possible tests include semen analysis, pituitary imaging studies, genetic studies, bone densitometry, testicular ultrasonography, testicular biopsy, and specialized hormonal dynamic testing. Therapeutic options generally consist of testosterone replacement by injections, patches, or topically applied gel in hypergonadotropic patients and in hypogonadotropic patients not interested in fertility. In hypogonadotropic patients interested in fertility, gonadal stimulation option scan be considered, including human chorionic gonadotropin stimulation therapy with or without human menopausal gonadotropin (or follicle-stimulating hormone) or gonadotropin-releasing hormone pump therapy. These therapies may be combined with assisted reproductive technologies such as in vitro fertilization with intracytoplasmic sperm injection, which may allow pregnancy to occur with very low numbers of sperm.

### Hormonal replacement in hypopituitarism in adults: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^1171UtFD]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Medium credibility.

Testosterone assessment and related remarks — age effects, binding, and testing considerations: Testosterone levels demonstrate an age-related decline, with healthy men reaching the highest serum T levels around the age of 30 years and thereafter showing a gradual decline at a rate of 1–2% annually, and the level below which symptoms occur has not been clearly established; about 2% of circulating T is free, 44% is bound to sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), and 54% is bound to albumin and other proteins. For borderline low T values, two measurements performed with the same assay are preferred. When assessing fertility is required, clinicians should perform semen analysis before starting T replacement, and hormone replacement therapy (HRT) reduces circulating gonadotropins with reductions of up to 60% for FSH and 50% for LH.

### Reference ranges for testosterone in men generated using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry in a community-based sample of healthy nonobese young men in the framingham heart study and applied to three geographically distinct cohorts [^116KST3s]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

Context

Reference ranges are essential for partitioning testosterone levels into low or normal and making the diagnosis of androgen deficiency. We established reference ranges for total testosterone (TT) and free testosterone (FT) in a community-based sample of men.

Methods

TT was measured using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry in nonobese healthy men, 19–40 yr old, in the Framingham Heart Study Generation 3; FT was calculated. Values below the 2.5th percentile of reference sample were deemed low. We determined the association of low TT and FT with physical dysfunction, sexual symptoms [European Male Aging Study (EMAS) only], and diabetes mellitus in three cohorts: Framingham Heart Study generations 2 and 3, EMAS, and the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men Study.

Results

In a reference sample of 456 men, mean (sd), median (quartile), and 2.5th percentile values were 723.8 (221.1), 698.7 (296.5), and 348.3 ng/dl for TT and 141. 8 (45.0), 134.0 (60.0), and 70.0 pg/ml for FT, respectively. In all three samples, men with low TT and FT were more likely to have slow walking speed, difficulty climbing stairs, or frailty and diabetes than those with normal levels. In EMAS, men with low TT and FT were more likely to report sexual symptoms than men with normal levels. Men with low TT and FT were more likely to have at least one of the following: sexual symptoms (EMAS only), physical dysfunction, or diabetes.

Conclusion

Reference ranges generated in a community-based sample of men provide a rational basis for categorizing testosterone levels as low or normal. Men with low TT or FT by these criteria had higher prevalence of physical dysfunction, sexual dysfunction, and diabetes. These reference limits should be validated prospectively in relation to incident outcomes and in randomized trials.

### Circulating dihydrotestosterone, testosterone, and free testosterone levels and dihydrotestosterone-to-testosterone ratios in healthy women across the menstrual cycle [^113RY3XB]. Fertility and Sterility (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To characterize the circulating androgen levels across the menstrual cycle in healthy women using highly sensitive and accurate methods and report sex differences in the relative levels of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) to testosterone (T) levels.

Design

Prospective cohort study.

Setting

Research clinic, academic teaching hospital.

Patient(S)

Twenty-one healthy premenopausal women, aged 19–40 years, with regular menstrual cycles.

Intervention(S)

Not applicable.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Serum total T and DHT levels measured using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, free T levels measured using a standardized equilibrium dialysis method coupled with measurement of the T levels in the dialysate using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, and comparison of the DHT-to-T ratio between healthy women and age-matched healthy men.

Result(S)

The serum total and free T levels increased across the follicular phase and peaked at midcycle (total T, 43.6 ± 16.2 ng/dL; free T, 15.6 ± 11.9 pg/mL) and gradually declined in the luteal phase. The DHT level did not significantly change across the menstrual cycle. The DHT-to-T ratios were 1:4 and 1:13 in women and men, respectively.

Conclusion(S)

In healthy premenopausal women, the total and free T levels varied significantly across the menstrual cycle, whereas the DHT levels did not change; the peak total and free T levels in the midcycle period were higher than previously reported, underscoring the importance of establishing menstrual phase-specific reference ranges to avoid misdiagnosis of hyperandrogenism. Women have significantly higher DHT levels relative to total T than men; the significance of this sex difference in the DHT-to-T ratio needs further investigation.

Clinicians should monitor men receiving T therapy using a standardized plan that includes: evaluating symptoms, adverse effects, and compliance; measuring serum T and hematocrit concentrations; and evaluating prostate cancer risk during the first year after initiating T therapy.

### H7N9 avian influenza virus infection in men is associated with testosterone depletion [^1147C6Vj]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

In H7N9-infected women, total testosterone levels were comparable to H7N9-negative close contacts and H7N9-negative poultry workers, albeit a slight tendency towards elevated testosterone levels was observed in those infected with H7N9 (Fig. 1c). This tendency of elevated testosterone levels was also observed in women who died during the course of H7N9 infection compared to those who survived (Fig. 1d). In H7N9-infected women, free testosterone levels were within the normal reference range, albeit slightly higher in those aged above 50 years who later died (Supplementary Fig. 1c). SHBG levels were within the normal reference range according to the manufacturer's instructions without relevant changes among the groups assessed (Supplementary Fig. 1d).

In men with seasonal H1N1 or H3N2 influenza infections, total testosterone levels were lower in those who were hospitalized than in those who were not hospitalized (outpatients), particularly among the 18- to 49-year-olds (p = 0.0128) (Fig. 1e). Free testosterone levels in men with seasonal influenza were distributed at the lowest percentile of the normal reference range in all groups assessed (Supplementary Fig. 1e). SHBG levels were within the normal reference rangein all groups (Supplementary Fig. 1f).

In women with seasonal influenza, there was a slight tendency towards elevated total testosterone levels in those who were hospitalized compared to outpatients (Fig. 1f). Free testosterone levels were within the normal reference range in all women assessed, albeit higher in those above 50 years of age who were hospitalized compared to outpatients (p = 0.0020) (Supplementary Fig. 1g). SHBG levels were within the normal reference range in all women assessed (Supplementary Fig. 1h).

These data indicate that H7N9 infection in 18 to 49-year-old as well as in ≥ 50-year-old men, unlike in women, is associated with reduced total and free testosterone levels. Moreover, the data presented here support the hypothesis that low total testosterone levels in 18- to 49-year-old men are associated with fatal outcomes.

### International society for the study of women's sexual health clinical practice guideline for the use of systemic testosterone for hypoactive sexual desire disorder in women [^116jsF1s]. Journal of Women's Health (2021). Medium credibility.

In women whose total testosterone levels are in the upper end of the physiologic range and not experiencing improvement of HSDD symptoms, calculating free testosterone might provide insight to the lack of response to therapy. An online free and bioavailable testosterone calculator, utilizing total testosterone and SHBG values, is available at. If elevated SHBG (and resultant decreased free testosterone) is deemed to be related to the lack of efficacy of testosterone therapy, the contributing factors should be addressed; if modification is not possible, the clinician should use a different approach to managing the woman's HSDD. Increasing the woman's testosterone dose and total testosterone levels beyond physiologic range to "overcome" elevated SHBG is a clinical strategy that is not supported by current evidence on androgen metabolism, AR and intracrine effects, and short- and long-term safety. In countries where tibolone is available, it can be used as an alternative MHT in women with high SHBG as tibolone lowers SHBG by approximately 45%.

Patients should be assessed for signs of androgen excess including acne (oily skin), hirsutism (increased facial hair), and androgenic alopecia (thinning of scalp hair). If side effects occur, the dose of testosterone should usually be decreased. Occasionally, androgenic side effects may occur despite standard dosing or normal serum levels of total testosterone or both. This circumstance may occur with low concentrations of SHBG, which may be associated with type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and/or obesity.

Measurement of liver function and a fasting lipid profile is recommended before initiating treatment. Although these tests are unaffected by physiologic doses of transdermal testosterone, liver disease and hyperlipidemia are contraindications to testosterone therapy.

Earlier guidelines recommended annual breast and pelvic examinations, annual mammography, and evaluation of abnormal bleeding, as well as periodic monitoring of lipid profile, liver function tests, and complete blood count. Given the available safety data, it is reasonable to perform clinical surveillance in accordance with contemporary country-specific guidelines and laboratory testing semiannually, as well as the first year and annually each year thereafter.

Testosterone testing confirmation — because serum testosterone (T) concentrations vary significantly due to diurnal, circadian and circannual rhythms, episodic secretion, and assay variations, it is important to confirm low T concentrations since 30% of men with an initial T concentration in the hypogonadal range have a normal T concentration on repeat measurement, and a small fraction of healthy young men can fall below the normal range during a 24-hour period.

### Does calculated free testosterone overcome total testosterone in protecting from sexual symptom impairment? Findings of a cross-sectional study [^112fC7rm]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Although erectile dysfunction (ED) has been associated with low circulating total testosterone (TT) levels, the utility of free testosterone (FT) over TT is debatable.

Aim

To assess the relative impact of low TT and low calculated FT (cFT) on androgen-related sexual symptoms in men with ED.

Methods

Data from 485 men were analyzed. Comorbidities were scored with the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI). Patients completed the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) and the Beck Inventory for Depression (BDI). Descriptive statistics tested differences between patients with normal TT levels (> 3 ng/mL) and normal cFT levels (> 65 pg/mL; group 1) and men with normal TT and low cFT (group 2), low TT and normal cFT (group 3), and low TT and low cFT (group 4). Linear regression models tested the association between clinical predictors and sexual function impairment.

Outcomes

We assessed the impact of different hormonal categories on androgen-related symptoms and the clinical utility of measuring cFT in men with ED.

Results

Groups 1, 2, 3, and 4 were composed of 338 (69.6%), 44 (9.1%), 34 (7.0%), and 69 (14.3%) patients, respectively. Compared with group 1, patients in group 2 were older (P < .001), had a higher body mass index (P < .01), and had a larger proportion with CCI scores of at least 1 (P = 0.006). Likewise, group 2 presented lower scores for the IIEF erectile function (P = 0.07), sexual desire (P = 0.04), and orgasmic function (P = 0.007) domains and lower BDI scores (P = 0.02) than group 1. Similar findings were found for group 4 vs 1. Conversely, patients in group 3 had similar scores on the questionnaires to those in group 1. Low cFT and normal or low TT achieved independent predictor status for pathologic IIEF domains and BDI scores after accounting for age, CCI, and body mass index. Conversely, low TT and normal cFT status was not associated with pathologic scores on the questionnaires.

Clinical Implications

The inclusion of cFT in the first-line assessment of hypogonadal symptoms in men with ED has major clinical utility.

Strengths and Limitations

This is the first study evaluating the concomitant impact of TT and cFT on men with ED using well-validated instruments to assess patients' sexuality and depressive symptoms. Limitations are the retrospective nature of the study and lack of physical function data and bone ultrasound measurements.

Conclusions

Although normal cFT was not associated with signs and symptoms suggestive of testosterone deficiency, even when concomitant with low TT or low cFT irrespective of TT values, it was indicative of poorer clinical profiles and impaired sexual and depressive parameters compared with normal TT and normal cFT in a cohort of patients with ED.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 194 summary: polycystic ovary syndrome [^113mg1ip]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Medium credibility.

Androgen excess evaluation — the best measurement of circulating androgens to document unexplained androgen excess is uncertain; the present recommendation by the AES is to measure free testosterone concentration either directly by equilibrium dialysis, or to calculate free testosterone based on accurately measured total testosterone and SHBG, and clinicians should be aware there is no standardized testosterone assay in the United States and sensitivity and reliability in the female ranges are often poor; evaluation of DHEAS levels may be useful in cases of rapid virilization but its utility in assessing common hirsutism is questionable.

### Evaluation and treatment of hirsutism in premenopausal women: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^114TpmrL]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Medium credibility.

Androgen testing in hirsutism — Local sexual hair growth without other clinical evidence "does not require an endocrine workup before embarking on dermatologic therapy". For laboratory assessment, "An accurate and specific assay, such as mass spectrometry, is the best choice for assessing serum total testosterone concentrations", and reference norms are "standardized for early morning, when levels are the highest, and for days 4 to 10 of the menstrual cycle". "Women with mild hirsutism, a normal total testosterone level, a pelvic ultrasound showing normal ovarian morphology (if performed), and no clinical evidence of other hyperandrogenic endocrine disorders have idiopathic hirsutism". If total testosterone is normal but clinical suspicion remains, "clinicians should test serum free-testosterone levels", and "Assessing free testosterone levels… is the single most useful, clinically sensitive marker of androgen excess in women". Because "Progression of hyperandrogenism in the presence of a normal serum-free testosterone is very unusual", "clinicians should thoroughly reevaluate these patients", and "Unless fertility is an issue (37), demonstrating polycystic ovary morphology to diagnose ovulatory PCOS is unlikely to affect management".

### The laboratory diagnosis of testosterone deficiency [^112mxnrd]. Urology (2014). Low credibility.

The evaluation and treatment of hypogonadal men has become an important part of urologic practice. Fatigue, loss of libido, and erectile dysfunction are commonly reported, but nonspecific symptoms and laboratory verification of low testosterone (T) are an important part of evaluation in addition to a detailed history and physical examination. Significant intraindividual fluctuations in serum T levels, biologic variation of T action on end organs, the wide range of T levels in human serum samples, and technical limitations of currently available assays have led to poor reliability of T measurements in the clinical laboratory setting. There is no universally accepted threshold of T concentration that distinguishes eugonadal from hypogonadal men; thus, laboratory results have to be interpreted in the appropriate clinical setting. This review focuses on clinical, biological, and technological challenges that affect serum T measurements to educate clinicians regarding technological advances and limitations of the currently available laboratory methods to diagnose hypogonadism. A collaborative effort led by the American Urological Association between practicing clinicians, patient advocacy groups, government regulatory agencies, industry, and professional societies is underway to provide optimized assay platforms and evidence-based normal assay ranges to guide clinical decision making. Until such standardization is commonplace in clinical laboratories, the decision to treat should be based on the presence of signs and symptoms in addition to serum T measurements. Rigid interpretation of T ranges should not dictate clinical decision making or define coverage of treatment by third party payers.

Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea — hyperandrogenism testing approach: In the workup for hyperandrogenism, familiarity with local reference ranges is important, as assays are not standardized across laboratories; clinicians should obtain total or free testosterone levels (depending on assay reliability and noting that the former is usually more accurate), and clinicians should also consider measuring serum DHEA-S to rule out adrenal etiologies; some experts consider an elevated free testosterone level (measuring both total and free testosterone using a gold standard assay) the most useful indicator of PCOS.

### Serum testosterone levels in males with Alzheimer's disease [^111QuHtF]. Journal of Neuroendocrinology (2004). Low credibility.

This study aimed to investigate whether there are differences in serum testosterone levels between male patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cognitively normal male controls. Testosterone and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) levels were measured from 14 patients with mild to moderate AD and 16 age-matched control males. The AD patients had higher levels of serum total (P = 0.02) and free testosterone (P < 0.001), and higher free androgen index (FAI) (P = 0.02) compared to controls. No differences were found for the SHBG levels. These data provide no support for hypotheses of (disproportionally) decreased levels of serum testosterone in AD. These data also show that all cognitively normal controls had an FAI below the normal range.

### Osteoporosis in men: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^114gaRmZ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Medium credibility.

Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline — laboratory assessment and related risk markers: Measurements of serum testosterone levels are useful to identify men who have androgen deficiency and who may be candidates for testosterone replacement. Low levels of both testosterone and estradiol are associated with bone loss and fractures in men, although the associations are weak, and low estradiol levels are more strongly associated with increased fracture risk and accelerated bone loss in older men. Measurement of estradiol levels in clinical situations in men is not recommended because of the lack of easily available, accurate assay methods and the absence of validated clinical algorithms that incorporate estradiol measurements into treatment decisions. High SHBG levels are associated with increased fracture incidence and bone loss in older men.

### Evaluation and treatment of hirsutism in premenopausal women: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^112atGtM]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Medium credibility.

Androgen testing — physiology, assay selection, and recommendations are summarized as follows: Testosterone is the key androgen to measure because it is the major circulating androgen, and levels are highest in the early morning and vary by ~25% around the mean; in ovulatory women, levels reach a midcycle zenith. Considerable evidence supports that the bioactive portion of serum testosterone is the free testosterone, and the serum free (or bioavailable) testosterone level is more often elevated in hirsute women than the total testosterone level and is more sensitive than total testosterone in detecting excess androgen production; the reason for this greater diagnostic sensitivity is that hirsute women commonly have a relatively low level of sex hormone–binding globulin (SHBG). The automated immunometric assays available in most hospital laboratories are generally not suitable to accurately measure testosterone in women, although some direct radioimmunoassays and chemiluminescence assays in specialty laboratories provide results comparable to the new generation of liquid chromatography/ mass spectrometry methods. Salivary testosterone correlates with serum-free testosterone but values diverge widely between laboratories, so we recommend against this methodology, and we also do not recommend measurements of urinary testosterone (testosterone glucuronide). There is no uniform laboratory standard for free or bioavailable testosterone levels, assay-specific results differ widely, and direct assay of serum-free testosterone is unreliable.

Serum testosterone measurement — serum testosterone (T) concentrations exhibit a diurnal variation with peak values in the morning, aging reduces the magnitude of this rhythm, glucose and food intake suppress T concentrations, and therefore clinicians should measure T concentrations in the morning after an overnight fast; notably, a substantial fraction of 65- to 80-year-old men with low afternoon T concentrations will have normal morning values.

### Statin therapy is associated with lower total but not bioavailable or free testosterone in men with type 2 diabetes [^116vRdJD]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

There is evidence that men with the metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease have a high prevalence of low circulating levels of testosterone. A significant proportion of these men are hypogonadal, defined as a combination of clinical symptoms and biochemical evidence of testosterone deficiency. The lower limit of normal serum testosterone levels, which defines the biochemical diagnosis of hypogonadism, is not fully clear. Studies have shown that about 20% of men with metabolic syndrome, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease have testosterone levels below the normal range, and there are a further 20–25% with levels in the low normal range that may also be compatible with a diagnosis of hypogonadism, depending on clinical symptoms.

The great majority of men with diabetes and cardiovascular disease are being treated with statins. Cholesterol is the substrate for testosterone biosynthesis, and theoretically, hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors such as statins could affect serum testosterone levels. Animal studies have shown that statins can reduce testosterone production when given in high doses. Studies in humans, mostly involving small numbers of men, have shown various results. The majority have shown no effect of statins on testosterone levels, but some have shown reduced testosterone levels with simvastatin treatment.

Total testosterone is the most widely used biochemical test in the diagnosis of men with hypogonadism. Total testosterone comprises free testosterone (2–3%) and testosterone bound to either sex hormone–binding globulin (SHBG) (60–80%) or albumin (20–40%). Free plus albumin-bound testosterone is generally regarded as the biologically active or bioavailable component. Testosterone bound to SHBG is considered to be inactive although recent research has suggested that SHBG-bound testosterone may be taken into cells by endocytosis, possibly allowing biological actions. Studies have demonstrated that bioavailable or free testosterone better reflects androgen status, for example, by correlations with bone mineral density and erectile dysfunction. Laboratory measures of bioavailable and free testosterone are not routinely available, as they are time-consuming and only small numbers of tests can be analyzed simultaneously. Mathematical formulae to calculate these fractions based on total testosterone and SHBG are available but have to be validated locally before clinical use because of differences in total testosterone assays.

### Hyperandrogenism and cardiometabolic risk in pre-and postmenopausal women-what is the evidence? [^112ZNjwa]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Hyperandrogenism, defined as androgen excess originating from the ovaries and/or the adrenal glands, is a common condition in premenopausal women, and may also persist or develop in postmenopausal women. The symptoms include hirsutism, acne, and androgenic alopecia, and in severe and more rare cases, virilizing symptoms, also including deepening of the voice, breast atrophy, increased muscle mass, and enlargement of the clitoris.

The present review focuses on the clinical diagnoses of hyperandrogenism described later in the article. However, references are also made to associations between testosterone levels, or derived measures such as free androgen index (FAI; 100 × total testosterone SHBG) and cardiometabolic outcomes. In this context, it should be acknowledged that the methodology of testosterone determination has varied among studies and today only liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry is considered accurate, whereas immunoassays are burdened with cross-reactivity and are not sensitive enough for determination at low concentrations. Furthermore, although FAI is recommended for clinical use in the diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), it is a derived measure of testosterone that lacks certified reference ranges and may reflect changes in SHBG as well as testosterone.

PCOS is considered the most common cause of hyperandrogenism in women and is characterized by anovulation, hyperandrogenism, and polycystic ovarian morphology. Based on the Rotterdam definition of PCOS, the global prevalence in premenopausal women ranges between 10% and 13%. A history of oligo/amenorrhea and ovarian hyperandrogenism during the reproductive years can be used for diagnosing PCOS in postmenopausal women, as suggested by The Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guideline. Although symptoms of hyperandrogenism in PCOS are relatively mild to moderate and often improve after menopause, it is recognized that postmenopausal women with a history of PCOS are more likely to have elevated serum androgen levels (total testosterone, FAI, androstenedione) and higher prevalence of hirsutism than women without PCOS. Ovarian hyperthecosis is considered the peri- and postmenopausal woman's variant of PCOS. It is caused by nests of luteinized theca cells in the ovarian stroma, producing excess amounts of testosterone. Ovarian hyperthecosis is a rare disorder and the symptoms of hyperandrogenism are usually more extreme with slow progression to virilization, which is not the case in PCOS.

### Approach to the patient: the evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^115QEYwb]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

He began transdermal testosterone therapy at a typical replacement dosage, and the dosage was adjusted to achieve a serum total testosterone in the normal range. At 3- and 6-month follow-up evaluations, he reported improved sense of well-being and sexual function. His serum hemoglobin and hematocrit had increased 5% above baseline, but both remained in the normal range. He had lost another 4.3 kg (and now weighs 93.0 kg) with diet and exercise. He had lost a total of 6.3 kg (∼6% of body weight since his initial evaluation). At 12 months of follow-up, he reported that the "testosterone therapy does not seem to be working as well for sexual function". His bone density (2 years after the last bone densitometry) was not significantly changed.

After discussion, he agreed to discontinue testosterone therapy and reassess serum testosterone. Two months after discontinuation, his serum total testosterone was 260 ng/dL (9.02 nmol/L; reference range, 264–916 ng/dL or 9.16–31.8 nmol/L) in a validated, harmonized assay, and his serum free T was 75 pg/mL (259 pmol/L; reference range, 66–272.3 pg/mL or 229–710 pmol/L). Repeat testing 3 months after discontinuation demonstrated a serum total testosterone of 266 ng/dL (9.2 nmol/L), and a serum calculated free T of 77 pg/mL (267 pmol/L). He noticed no change in symptoms after discontinuation of testosterone therapy. He enquired about a higher dosage of testosterone.

How Should the Clinical Suspicion of Androgen Deficiency Be Assessed Biochemically?

Reproducibly low serum total testosterone concentrations measured by an accurate testosterone assay on a sample drawn in the early morning (7–10 Am) in the fasting state are a cornerstone of the diagnosis of male hypogonadism. It is optimal to use a total testosterone assay that has been validated by an accuracy-based standardization or quality control program with a normal range of 264–916 ng/dL (9.16–31.8 nmol/L) in healthy, young men. Use of such an assay facilitates application of findings of the T-Trials, the largest randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing testosterone vs placebo with clinically important outcomes in men with low serum testosterone concentrations, and the soon-to-be-reported TRAVERSE study, a large RCT with cardiovascular outcomes; these trials used a standardized, harmonized total testosterone assay with this normal range.

If the initial serum total testosterone is low, confirmation is required. Without compelling evidence (eg, specific clinical features, such as very small testes and high serum gonadotropin concentrations), androgen deficiency should not be diagnosed with a single low testosterone concentration because of significant diurnal and day-to-day variation. Up to 30% of older men with a low serum testosterone concentration have a normal value on repeat testing. Overnight fasting increases serum testosterone by 9% to 16% and reduces the significant diurnal variability of serum testosterone concentrations. Most experts prefer to err in underdiagnosing very mild hypogonadism in older men over misdiagnosing eugonadal men as hypogonadal. The benefit of testosterone therapy on vitality and bone (and likely other parameters) is related to the change from baseline serum testosterone in older men; men with lower serum baseline testosterone concentrations are more likely to benefit from normalization of serum testosterone. Therefore, borderline low serum testosterone concentrations or multiple serum testosterone measurements that are discordant (eg, one result that is slightly low and one that is normal) should be interpreted cautiously and generally not as confirmatory evidence of hypogonadism.

### Androgen therapy in women: a reappraisal: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^113ySkvK]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Medium credibility.

Free testosterone measurement — testosterone circulates bound to sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), albumin, and corticosteroid-binding globulin, with the latter binding less than 5% of the total that is bound; calculated free T depends on total T, SHBG, albumin, and dissociation constants, and although the dissociation constant for SHBG–T is about 10−9 M, there is no universally agreed upon SHBG standard and there is disagreement on calculation methods. Despite these difficulties, the calculated value of T is widely used and is often comparable with measured values, while the most reliable ways to measure free T are by equilibrium dialysis or ultrafiltration. The direct immunoassays for free T are simple and relatively inexpensive, but this methodology is seriously flawed and cannot be recommended.

6.2 Testosterone

Validated, highly accurate tandem mass spectrometry (LC‐MS/MS) assays are recommended to measure serum total testosterone in women. However, across the UK, immunoassays remain the most accessible analytical technique (UK NEQAS, Table S1). Most T immunoassays display a bias relative to LC‐MS/MS in female samples, which may be either positive or negative depending on the manufacturer and can also be concentration‐dependent. Further data on the performance of several commercially available immunoassays in the United Kingdom compared to gold standard LC‐MS/MS are provided in the UK NEQAS, Figure S1. This bias has been attributed to poor standardisation, poor sensitivity and nonspecific cross‐reactivity. Bias may also exhibit temporal variation thereby reflecting reagent and calibrator reformulation (UK NEQAS, Figure S1). Conversely, LC‐MS/MS assays rely on purification and chromatography to minimise matrix effects, improve sensitivity and reduce analytical interference. The mass spectrometer adds additional specificity as detection is based on mass‐to‐charge ratio rather than antibody‐antigen reactions. Nevertheless, LC‐MS/MS has limitations and variation between methods has been attributed to differences in sample preparation and calibration. Thus, although measurement by LC‐MS/MS remains the reference standard, this may not be viable for many UK hospital laboratories.

Recommendations
Exclude the use of exogenous testosterone, for example, in postmenopausal women.
All results should be interpreted against evidence‐based reference ranges. These should be categorised as either age‐specific and/or pre‐ and post‐menopausal.
A diagnosis of biochemical hyperandrogenism should be evaluated with an index of free testosterone, particularly if total testosterone is normal in a patient with clinical androgen excess (see below).
Testosterone concentrations > 5 nmol/L 1 warrant further investigation including validation with LC‐MS/MS and follow‐up with ovarian and/or adrenal imaging as appropriate.
Testosterone concentrations that do not otherwise align with the clinical picture should be validated with LC‐MS/MS.

### Evaluation and treatment of hirsutism in premenopausal women: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^113v4GNt]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis of hirsutism — We suggest testing for elevated androgen levels in all women with an abnormal hirsutism score (2 ⊕⊕OO). In those cases where serum total testosterone levels are normal, if sexual hair growth is moderate/severe or sexual hair growth is mild but there is clinical evidence of a hyperandrogenic endocrine disorder (such as menstrual disturbance or progression in spite of therapy), we suggest measuring an early morning serum total and free testosterone by a reliable specialty assay (2 ⊕⊕OO).
