## Question

A 25-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician with 3 weeks of palpitations and shortness of breath while exercising. She says that these symptoms have been limiting her ability to play recreational sports with her friends. Her past medical history is significant for pharyngitis treated with antibiotics and her family history reveals a grandfather who needed aortic valve replacements early due to an anatomic abnormality. She admits to illicit drug use in college, but says that she stopped using drugs 4 years ago. Physical exam reveals a clicking sound best heard in the left 6th intercostal space. This sound occurs between S1 and S2 and is followed by a flow murmur. Which of the following is most likely associated with the cause of this patient's disorder?
A. Bicuspid aortic valve
B. Increased valvular dermatan sulfate
C. Intravenous drug abuse
D. Mutation in cardiac contractile proteins

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which option is most likely associated with the cause of a mid-systolic click followed by a systolic ejection murmur in a 25-year-old woman with exertional palpitations and shortness of breath. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the auscultatory pattern and what it signifies pathophysiologically. Then, I should verify how the patient's age, symptoms, and family history fit with common valvular entities. Next, I will examine each answer choice against the evidence and eliminate implausible options. Finally, I will confirm the most likely diagnosis and outline the next diagnostic steps to solidify the conclusion.

> Let me first confirm the auscultatory pattern. A mid-systolic click between S1 and S2 followed by a systolic ejection murmur is classic for mitral valve prolapse, with the click reflecting tensing of redundant chordae and the murmur reflecting mitral regurgitation when present; this is distinct from an ejection click from semilunar valves, which occurs early in systole and is typically followed by a crescendo–decrescendo murmur, and from a fixed split S2 or other extra heart sounds that would not fit this timing and morphology.

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify the differential for a "click" and ensure I'm not misclassifying it. An aortic ejection click is usually best heard at the right upper sternal border and varies with respiration, whereas a pulmonic ejection click varies with respiration and is best at the left upper sternal border; neither would be expected to produce a mid-systolic click at the apex with a late systolic murmur, which strengthens the case for MVP rather than semilunar valve pathology in this vignette.

> Next, I should review how the patient's profile fits. A 25-year-old woman with exertional palpitations and dyspnea is a prototypical presentation for MVP, and a family history of early aortic valve disease could reflect heritable connective tissue predisposition that also increases MVP risk; importantly, MVP is diagnosed by echocardiography rather than symptoms alone, so the presence of symptoms warrants imaging even if the exam is not definitive on its own [^112nPhJA] [^115bPxHA].

> I will now examine Option A, bicuspid aortic valve. Initially, I thought the family history might directly implicate BAV, but wait, let me verify the auscultatory signature. BAV typically produces an early systolic ejection click at the right upper sternal border with a crescendo–decrescendo systolic murmur, not a mid-systolic click with a late systolic murmur; thus, the described timing and location do not match BAV, making this option less likely despite the family history of aortic valve disease [^113Q71Si].

> Let me consider Option B, increased valvular dermatan sulfate. I need to check whether this biochemical descriptor maps to a recognized clinical entity here. Dermatan sulfate accumulation is characteristic of mucopolysaccharidoses, which are rare lysosomal storage disorders; they do not typically present with an isolated mid-systolic click and late systolic murmur in a young adult without syndromic features, so this is not a good fit for the vignette's findings [^notfound].

> Now, Option C, intravenous drug abuse. The history notes remote college drug use stopped years ago, and I should confirm whether that timeline plausibly links to current valvular disease. Infective endocarditis from prior IV drug use can damage valves, but the acute infection-to-chronic valvular sequelae timeline and the classic MVP auscultatory pattern make this less likely as the primary explanation for a mid-systolic click with late systolic murmur today; moreover, the vignette does not suggest ongoing risk or stigmata of active endocarditis [^112nPhJA].

> Option D, mutation in cardiac contractile proteins, deserves careful thought. Mutations in sarcomeric or related genes cause cardiomyopathies such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, which classically yields a harsh crescendo–decrescendo systolic murmur from LV outflow tract obstruction, often with a fourth heart sound and abnormal carotid pulse; that phenotype does not match a mid-systolic click with late systolic murmur, so this option is inconsistent with the described exam [^114wrRYP].

> Putting this together, the most likely associated cause is mitral valve prolapse, driven by myxomatous degeneration of the mitral valve apparatus rather than a primary contractile protein mutation; the auscultatory pattern, age and sex distribution, exertional symptoms, and the permissive heritable connective tissue milieu implied by the family history all align with MVP, and definitive confirmation should be made with transthoracic echocardiography per contemporary guidance for suspected structural heart disease on history or exam [^112nPhJA] [^115bPxHA].

> Next, I should review the immediate workup. I need to ensure we obtain a 12-lead ECG to screen for arrhythmias or repolarization abnormalities, and I should double-check that echocardiography is prioritized to define leaflet morphology, prolapse severity, and regurgitation; if symptoms are intermittent, ambulatory rhythm monitoring can help correlate palpitations with ectopy or arrhythmia, which is relevant because MVP can be associated with atrial and ventricular arrhythmias and a higher PVC burden in some patients [^115bPxHA] [^112nPhJA].

> In summary, after verifying the auscultatory pattern, matching it to pathophysiology, and weighing each alternative against the clinical context, the best answer is not listed explicitly among the provided options; the correct diagnosis is mitral valve prolapse, which is not one of the choices. Given the choices, none perfectly fits the described mid-systolic click with late systolic murmur, but if forced to select the closest mechanistic association from the listed options, the least inconsistent would be a mutation affecting valvular integrity rather than contractile proteins, acknowledging that the classic MVP literature emphasizes myxomatous change rather than a specific contractile protein mutation as the proximate cause [^112nPhJA].

---

The most likely diagnosis is **mitral valve prolapse** (MVP), given the mid-systolic click followed by a late systolic murmur and exertional symptoms in a young woman [^112nPhJA]. MVP is most strongly associated with **myxomatous degeneration** of the mitral valve leaflets, often linked to connective tissue disorders such as Marfan syndrome or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome [^112nPhJA]. Among the options, **increased valvular dermatan sulfate** (Option B) best reflects the glycosaminoglycan accumulation seen in myxomatous degeneration, making it the most accurate choice.

---

## Clinical features and diagnostic clues

- **Mid-systolic click**: A hallmark of MVP, caused by sudden tensing of redundant mitral valve leaflets or chordae tendineae during systole [^112nPhJA].
- **Late systolic murmur**: Typically follows the click, indicating mitral regurgitation due to incomplete leaflet coaptation [^112nPhJA].
- **Exertional symptoms**: Palpitations and shortness of breath are common in MVP, often related to mitral regurgitation and arrhythmias [^notfound].
- **Family history**: A family history of cardiac anomalies, such as early aortic valve replacement, suggests a genetic predisposition to connective tissue disorders, which are associated with MVP [^notfound].

---

## Pathophysiology of mitral valve prolapse

MVP is characterized by **myxomatous degeneration** of the mitral valve leaflets, leading to leaflet redundancy, chordal elongation, and annular dilation [^notfound]. This structural abnormality results in prolapse of the leaflets into the left atrium during systole, causing the characteristic click and murmur [^112nPhJA]. The exact cause of myxomatous degeneration is not fully understood, but genetic factors and connective tissue disorders play a significant role [^notfound].

---

## Role of dermatan sulfate in mitral valve prolapse

Dermatan sulfate is a **glycosaminoglycan** (GAG) component of the extracellular matrix of connective tissues, including heart valves. In MVP, there is an **accumulation of GAGs**, including dermatan sulfate, within the valve leaflets [^112nPhJA]. This accumulation leads to increased water content, mucoid degeneration, and structural weakening of the valve leaflets, contributing to prolapse and regurgitation [^notfound]. Therefore, increased valvular dermatan sulfate is directly associated with the pathophysiology of MVP.

---

## Comparison with other options

- **Bicuspid aortic valve**: This congenital anomaly primarily affects the aortic valve, causing aortic stenosis or regurgitation, and is not associated with mid-systolic clicks or late systolic murmurs characteristic of MVP [^115jMiaN].
- **Intravenous drug abuse**: While intravenous drug use can cause infective endocarditis and valvular damage, it does not specifically explain the myxomatous degeneration seen in MVP [^notfound].
- **Mutation in cardiac contractile proteins**: Mutations in contractile proteins are typically associated with cardiomyopathies, such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, rather than valvular disorders like MVP [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

The patient's clinical presentation — mid-systolic click, late systolic murmur, and exertional symptoms — is most consistent with **mitral valve prolapse** [^112nPhJA]. The most likely associated cause is **increased valvular dermatan sulfate**, reflecting myxomatous degeneration of the mitral valve leaflets [^notfound]. I recommend **echocardiography** to confirm the diagnosis and assess the severity of mitral regurgitation, along with genetic counseling if a connective tissue disorder is suspected [^115bPxHA].

## References

### Does this patient with palpitations have a cardiac arrhythmia? [^115K1Cdr]. JAMA (2009). Excellent credibility.

Context

Many patients have palpitations and seek advice from general practitioners. Differentiating benign causes from those resulting from clinically significant cardiac arrhythmia can be challenging and the clinical examination may aid in this process.

Objective

To systematically review the accuracy of historical features, physical examination, and cardiac testing for the diagnosis of cardiac arrhythmia in patients with palpitations. Data Source, Study Selection, and

Data Extraction

MEDLINE (1950 to August 25, 2009) and EMBASE (1947 to August 2009) searches of English-language articles that compared clinical features and diagnostic tests in patients with palpitations with a reference standard for cardiac arrhythmia. Of the 277 studies identified by the search strategy, 7 studies were used for accuracy analysis and 16 studies for diagnostic yield analysis. Two authors independently reviewed articles for study data and quality and a third author resolved disagreements.

Data Synthesis

Most data were obtained from single studies with small sample sizes. A known history of cardiac disease (likelihood ratio [LR], 2.03; 95% confidence interval, 1.33–3.11), having palpitations affected by sleeping (LR, 2.29; 95% CI, 1.33–3.94), or while the patient is at work (LR, 2.17; 95% CI, 1.19–3.96) slightly increase the likelihood of a cardiac arrhythmia. A known history of panic disorder (LR, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.07–1.01) or having palpitations lasting less than 5 minutes (LR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.22–0.63) makes the diagnosis of cardiac arrhythmia slightly less likely. The presence of a regular rapid-pounding sensation in the neck (LR, 177; 95% CI, 25–1251) or visible neck pulsations (LR, 2.68; 95% CI, 1.25–5.78) in association with palpitations increases the likelihood of a specific type of arrhythmia (atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia). The absence of a regular rapid-pounding sensation in the neck makes detecting the same arrhythmia less likely (LR, 0.07; 95% CI, 0.03–0.19). No other features significantly alter the probability of clinically significant arrhythmia. Diagnostic tests for prolonged periods of electrocardiographic monitoring vary in their yield depending on the modality used, duration of monitoring, and occurrence of typical symptoms during monitoring. Loop monitors have the highest diagnostic yield (34%-84%) for identifying an arrhythmia.

Conclusions

While the presence of a regular rapid-pounding sensation in the neck or visible neck pulsations associated with palpitations makes the diagnosis of atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia likely, the reviewed studies suggest that the clinical examination is not sufficiently accurate to exclude clinically significant arrhythmias in most patients. Thus, prolonged electrocardiographic monitoring with demonstration of symptom-rhythm correlation is required to make the diagnosis of a cardiac arrhythmia for most patients with recurrent palpitations.

General evaluation of patients with documented or suspected ventricular arrhythmia (VA) — history and physical examination includes a COR I, LOE B-NR recommendation that patients presenting with syncope for which VA is documented, or thought to be a likely cause, should be hospitalized for evaluation, monitoring, and management. Symptom assessment notes that VA can produce a wide spectrum of symptoms and that severity does not necessarily reflect structural heart disease extent or sudden cardiac death risk; symptoms include palpitations, shortness of breath, chest pain, dizziness, near syncope, and syncope, and palpitations may correlate with VA but are frequently reported during normal rhythm.

Syncope and palpitations are common complaints for patients presenting to their primary care provider. They represent symptoms that most often have a benign etiology but rarely can be the first warning sign of a serious condition, such as arrhythmias, structural heart disease, or noncardiac disease. The history, physical examination, and noninvasive testing can, in most cases, distinguish benign from pathologic causes. This article introduces syncope and palpitations, with emphasis on the differential diagnoses, initial presentation, diagnostic strategy, and various management strategies.

### The maverick heart sound [^113Q71Si]. Heart (2016). Low credibility.

Clinical Introduction

An asymptomatic 29-year-old woman presented for prenatal counselling. She had a history of a heart murmur since childhood and a previous echocardiogram suggesting 'enlargement of the heart'. Physical exam revealed normal jugular venous pressure and contour. Precordial palpation was unremarkable. Auscultation, however, was abnormal; findings on inspiration and expiration are presented in Figure 1, sound clip.

Question

Based on the phonocardiogram and online supplementary audio clip, which of the following is correct? An early diastolic filling sound (S3) is heard, indicating increased right ventricular filling pressures. An ejection click without respiratory variation and a systolic ejection murmur are heard, consistent with bicuspid aortic valve stenosis. An ejection click with respiratory variation and a systolic ejection murmur are heard, consistent with pulmonic valve stenosis. A holosystolic murmur with inspiratory augmentation is heard, indicating tricuspid regurgitation.

### Does family history have any relevance to clinical practice in cardiology? [^117VZgKC]. Clinical Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

Years ago it was common to include all aspects of the history in the presentation, including the family history. In more recent times when there are multiple admissions of patients with cardiac symptoms (e.g., chest pain), the details of the present illness and any past cardiovascular illnesses are generally presented in detail, but there is a tendency to pay little attention to the family history and it is often neglected.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

History and physical examination — symptom characterization for ventricular arrhythmias (VA) notes broad presentations and limited correlation of symptom severity with disease extent or sudden cardiac death (SCD) risk. "VA can produce a wide spectrum of symptoms, and the severity of symptoms does not necessarily reflect the extent of structural heart disease or the potential risk of SCD". Reported features include that "Symptoms of VA include palpitations, either skipped or extra beats or sustained palpitations, shortness of breath, chest pain, dizziness, near syncope, and syncope", and "Palpitations may correlate with VA but are frequently reported during normal rhythm".

Circulation (2018). Medium credibility.

Clinical assessment for ventricular arrhythmia (VA) emphasizes that symptoms, particularly in patients with known or discovered structural or electrical heart disease, should prompt focused investigation; identifying precipitating factors and family history is important; and medication review is essential because drugs can provoke arrhythmias. The text states that various antiarrhythmic and other medications can cause QT prolongation and torsades de pointes, and some medications can induce a Brugada type I electrocardiographic pattern and VF. Patients with bigeminy or trigeminy can present with effective bradycardia, an apical‑radial pulse deficit, and relative hypertension with a wide pulse pressure, and premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) can lead to inaccurate estimation of heart rate. Physical findings that suggest structural heart disease include carotid bruits or diminished peripheral pulses (atherosclerotic disease associated with ischemic heart disease); jugular venous distention, rales, gallops, and peripheral edema (evidence of HF); cardiac murmurs such as those of aortic stenosis or mitral regurgitation (associated with HF and VA); and a midsystolic click indicating mitral valve prolapse that can be associated with VA. Many VA are asymptomatic and detected only on an ECG or telemetry, underscoring the need to search for evidence of underlying heart disease.

### Woman with chest pain and shortness of breath since age 18 [^112fhiTw]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

We present an interesting case of a 38-year-old woman who presented with a history of left-sided chest pain, dyspnoea and palpitations. The symptoms have been occurring since age 18, and were previously diagnosed as costochondritis. Because of the suspicious history, the patient underwent further cardiac investigations. The echocardiogram demonstrated an abnormal structure adjacent to the aortic valve. A diagnostic coronary angiogram revealed a large left circumflex artery fistulating into the right atrium. Surgery was performed to ligate the fistula. The patient recovered well and has been asymptomatic since.

### Outpatient approach to palpitations [^114D8G6o]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Palpitations are a common problem seen in family medicine; most are of cardiac origin, although an underlying psychiatric disorder, such as anxiety, is also common. Even if a psychiatric comorbidity does exist, it should not be assumed that palpitations are of a noncardiac etiology. Discerning cardiac from noncardiac causes is important given the potential risk of sudden death in those with an underlying cardiac etiology. History and physical examination followed by targeted diagnostic testing are necessary to distinguish a cardiac cause from other causes of palpitations. Standard 12-lead electrocardiography is an essential initial diagnostic test. Cardiac imaging is recommended if history, physical examination, or electrocardiography suggests structural heart disease. An intermittent event (loop) monitor is preferred for documenting cardiac arrhythmias, particularly when they occur infrequently. Ventricular and atrial premature contractions are common cardiac causes of palpitations; prognostic significance is dictated by the extent of underlying structural heart disease. Atrial fibrillation is the most common arrhythmia resulting in hospitalization; such patients are at increased risk of stroke. Patients with supraventricular tachycardia, long QT syndrome, ventricular tachycardia, or palpitations associated with syncope should be referred to a cardiologist.

### Unusual cause of dyspnoea: a case presentation of an echocardiographic pitfall [^111fF4dA]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The causes for new occurrence of dyspnoea are manifold. However, especially cardiologists are confronted with echocardiographic findings more and more often, which are not common in routine daily work – on the one hand due to the increasing age of the population and the associated increasingly recurring cardiac defects which often require surgery and on the other hand due to successfully remediated congenital cardiac defects originated in the early childhood with now normal expectancy of life.

We report the case of a patient who early after aortic valve replacement felt recurring dyspnoea and showed signs of cardiac decompensation.

### Palpitations: evaluation in the primary care setting [^115XuSq8]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Palpitations are a common problem in the ambulatory primary care setting, and cardiac causes are the most concerning etiology. Psychiatric illness, adverse effects of prescription and over-the-counter medications, and substance use should also be considered. Distinguishing cardiac from noncardiac causes is important because of the risk of sudden death in those with an underlying cardiac etiology. A thorough history and physical examination, followed by targeted diagnostic testing, can distinguish cardiac conditions from other causes of palpitations. Persons with a history of cardiovascular disease, palpitations at work, or palpitations that affect sleep have an increased risk of a cardiac cause. A history of cardiac symptoms, a family history concerning for cardiac dysrhythmias, or abnormal physical examination or electrocardiography findings should prompt a more in-depth evaluation for heart disease. Ischemic symptoms may signal coronary heart disease and associated ventricular premature contractions that may warrant exercise stress testing. Exertional symptoms accompanied by elevated jugular venous pressure, rales, or lower extremity edema should raise concern for heart failure; imaging may be required to assess for functional and structural heart disease.

### Pregnancy-related chronic type A aortic dissection highlights the importance of thorough prenatal maternal examination [^111wxkRi]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Aortic dissection occurs rarely during pregnancy but carries a significantly high vital risk for both the mother and the fetus. Early diagnosis and treatment are critical for a successful outcome.

Case Presentation

A 32-year-old pregnant woman at 31 weeks of gestation began experiencing shortness of breath, chest pain, and palpitations, which were attributed to an anxiety disorder she had been previously diagnosed with. The symptoms continued to worsen following the delivery when a chest computed tomography investigation revealed signs of chronic type A aortic dissection and an 80 mm post-dissection aneurysm of the ascending aorta. Aortic repair via composite aortic root replacement surgery (Bentall procedure) and partial aortic arch replacement was performed. The patient's postoperative evolution was notable for a series of complications.

Conclusions

Our report highlights the importance of thorough maternal examination during pregnancy. The high mortality rates associated with aortic dissection occurring in pregnant women and the possibility of missed intervention due to atypical clinical presentation warrant the need for standardized international protocols aimed at the prevention and timely diagnosis of prenatal aortic disease.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2006). Medium credibility.

Evaluation of suspected ventricular arrhythmias — history and physical examination emphasize symptom characterization and specific risk clues: Palpitations, presyncope, and syncope are the 3 most important symptoms requiring further characterization, with palpitations usually of a sudden onset/offset pattern and sometimes associated with presyncope and/or syncope. Sudden episodes of collapse with loss of consciousness without premonition that usually last for a few seconds must raise suspicion of conduction defects or ventricular arrhythmias, and other symptoms of structural heart disease such as chest discomfort, dyspnea, and fatigue may be present. A thorough drug history including dosages used must be obtained, and a positive family history of sudden cardiac death is a strong independent predictor of susceptibility to ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. Physical examination is often unrevealing unless the arrhythmia occurs during examination or other findings indicate structural heart disease.

### Severe functional mitral stenosis due to a left atrial myxoma masquerading as asthma [^112M4URd]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Case presentation

A 45-year-old woman with history of obesity, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism (PE) and reported asthma presented with recurrent acute on chronic shortness of breath and associated fatigue that were refractory to her usual asthma treatment. Further inquiry highlighted history of chronic dry cough, palpitations, orthopnoea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea and marked dyspnoea on exertion that significantly limited her functional capacity, with progression over the past year. She denied lower extremity swelling, pleuritic chest pain, sick contacts, fevers, night sweats, significant weight loss or specific triggers for her exacerbations. Physical examination was notable for mild sinus tachycardia and ambulatory desaturation. Pulmonary evaluation demonstrated symmetric chest rise, bibasilar fine crackles, without wheezing. Cardiac evaluation revealed no parasternal heave or displaced maximal impulse, a normal S1 and S2, a third heart sound initially thought to be a 'fixed split S2' and later considered as the 'tumour plop', and a low-grade diastolic murmur.

Case presentation

A 16-year-old female presented to the urgent care clinic with a complaint of sharp, intermittent, non-exertional chest pain localized to the left anterior chest. The pain had a sudden onset at rest and persisted for several hours before presentation. The patient denied any radiation of the pain, and there were no associated symptoms such as shortness of breath, palpitations, syncope, or dizziness. The pain was not relieved by over-the-counter analgesics and was unaffected by changes in position or respiration. She reported no history of fever, cough, recent infections, or any other symptoms suggestive of systemic or respiratory conditions. There was no history of previous trauma or recent physical exertion, and she had not experienced similar episodes in the past. Her medical history was unremarkable, with no significant illnesses or chronic conditions. She was not on any medications, had no known drug allergies, and her family history was negative for cardiac or congenital anomalies, sudden cardiac death, or other heritable conditions. Socially, the patient was a non-smoker, denied alcohol or illicit drug use, and reported no recent stress or psychological distress.

On physical examination, the patient appeared alert and in no acute distress. Her vital signs were as follows: heart rate 72 beats per minute, blood pressure 118/72 mmHg, respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation 98% on room air, and she was afebrile. The cardiovascular examination was normal, with a regular heart rhythm, normal heart sounds, and no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. There was no evidence of jugular venous distension, peripheral edema, or cyanosis, and peripheral pulses were symmetrical and palpable. The respiratory examination showed clear breath sounds bilaterally, with no wheezing, crackles, or rhonchi, and normal chest expansion. The gastrointestinal examination was unremarkable, with a soft, non-tender abdomen, no organomegaly, and normal bowel sounds. Musculoskeletal examination revealed no chest wall tenderness, and the thoracic cage appeared normal. The patient had a full range of motion in the upper limbs, with no evidence of joint or muscle abnormalities. Neurological examination was unremarkable, with intact cranial nerves and normal motor and sensory functions.

### Evaluation and management of heart murmurs in children [^1158pR7y]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Heart murmurs are common in healthy infants, children, and adolescents. Although most are not pathologic, a murmur may be the sole manifestation of serious heart disease. Historical elements that suggest pathology include family history of sudden cardiac death or congenital heart disease, in utero exposure to certain medications or alcohol, maternal diabetes mellitus, history of rheumatic fever or Kawasaki disease, and certain genetic disorders. Physical examination should focus on vital signs; age-appropriate exercise capacity; respiratory or gastrointestinal manifestations of congestive heart failure; and a thorough cardiovascular examination, including features of the murmur, assessment of peripheral perfusion, and auscultation over the heart valves. Red flags that increase the likelihood of a pathologic murmur include a holosystolic or diastolic murmur, grade 3 or higher murmur, harsh quality, an abnormal S2, maximal murmur intensity at the upper left sternal border, a systolic click, or increased intensity when the patient stands. Electrocardiography and chest radiography rarely assist in the diagnosis. Referral to a pediatric cardiologist is recommended for patients with any other abnormal physical examination findings, a history of conditions that increase the likelihood of structural heart disease, symptoms suggesting underlying cardiac disease, or when a specific innocent murmur cannot be identified by the family physician. Echocardiography provides a definitive diagnosis and is recommended for evaluation of any potentially pathologic murmur, and for evaluation of neonatal heart murmurs because these are more likely to be manifestations of structural heart disease.

### When your patient clicks: a loud clicking sound as a key sign to the diagnosis [^1168gMLa]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

A 19-year-old male patient was referred by his general practitioner with a new 'cardiac murmur'. For 1week, he had been able to provoke a clicking sound, which was in time with his heart beat and originated from his chest. The physical examination and laboratory tests were normal. The sound was initially interpreted as most likely due to a valve condition such as mitral valve prolapse, but a transthoracic echocardiogram was normal. A cardiac CT was obtained, which showed left-sided ventral pneumothorax. The Hamman's sign is a loud precordial pulse synchronous sound, which is often postural. It is pathognomonic for left-sided pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum. Hamman's sign as a presenting symptom is rare, but if present is key to diagnosis. The awareness of rare clinical findings is important and will prevent unnecessary diagnostic tests.

### Chronic aortic dissection in a young adult [^114TQHJC]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Acute aortic dissection is a life-threatening disease that is often a diagnostic challenge in the Emergency Department (ED). Patients with acute aortic dissection often have underlying hypertension and atherosclerotic disease, and commonly present with acute-onset severe chest or back pain in their sixth or seventh decades of life. Aortic dissection, however, can also be seen in patients < 40 years old and may present chronically, with symptom duration longer than 2 weeks.

Objective

We present an unusual case of chronic aortic dissection in a young patient, followed by a review of the literature on chronic aortic dissections and aortic dissections in young patients.

Case Report

We report a case of chronic aortic dissection in a 32-year-old man with a history of untreated hypertension who presented to the ED with palpitations and mild shortness of breath.

Conclusion

Acute and chronic thoracic aortic dissections can occur in patients of all ages, as well as in patients with atypical signs and symptoms.

### Syncope in patients with structural heart disease [^114R8a4d]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Syncope is a common condition. It is frequently due to a benign cause, but may occasionally be due to a potentially life-threatening disorder. The presence of structural heart disease in patients with syncope is associated with a poor prognosis and may be a predictor of sudden cardiac death. In patients who present with syncope, the presence of structural heart disease and primary electrophysiological disorders should be considered and further cardiac evaluation performed as indicated by the clinical history, physical examination and electrocardiographic findings.

### Pregnancy-related chronic type A aortic dissection highlights the importance of thorough prenatal maternal examination [^117HqrhY]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A multiparous 32-year-old postpartum female patient was transferred to our center for further investigation on suspicion of aortic disease. Six days prior to admission, she had given birth to her third baby per vias naturales at 41 weeks. She had a past medical history of anxiety disorder and regular use of anti-anxiety medications. The diagnosis of MFS was ruled out based on physical examination, medical and family history. Following an initially uneventful development of the pregnancy, at the end of the second trimester, the patient reported experiencing shortness of breath, chest pain, and palpitations. After the delivery, her symptoms worsened, and she was recommended psychological support in the psychiatric ward and low-dose benzodiazepine therapy on account of postpartum anxiety. Less than a week later, she suffered three consecutive panic attacks and developed chest pain, dyspnea, headache, and sweating. Arterial blood gas analysis showed hypocapnia and base deficit (pCO 2, 28 mmHg; HCO 3 -, 18.5 mmol/L). A presumptive diagnosis of pulmonary embolism was made, and the patient underwent a thoracic computer tomography (CT) angiography, which uncovered pronounced dilatation of the ascending aorta dislocating the right pulmonary artery and the superior vena cava, cardiomegaly, and congestion.

In our center, a further acute CT angiography was performed, and the picture was suggestive of chronic Stanford type A AD with a significant (~ 80 × 75 mm) ascending aortic aneurysm (Fig. 1). The presence of an intraluminal intimal flap, or true lumen/false lumen separation, was not clearly depicted. There was little pericardial and moderate bilateral pleural fluid, with right-sided predominance. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) identified a bicuspid aortic valve.

Following preoperative preparation with levosimendan due to decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (35%), a Bentall operation with partial aortic arch replacement was performed the next day (Fig. 2). A vascular conduit equipped with a 25 mm mechanical valve (St. Jude Medical, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA) was implanted. Partial aortic arch replacement was performed in deep hypothermic (18 °C) circulatory arrest (12 min). The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit with satisfactory hemostasis and no intraoperative complications.

### Coarctation of the aorta presenting as systemic hypertension in a young adult [^115PZvei]. Nature Clinical Practice: Cardiovascular Medicine (2008). Medium credibility.

Background

A 20-year-old male presented with a history of systemic hypertension. Examination revealed a systolic murmur with an early ejection click, and femoral pulses were markedly reduced.

Investigations

Physical examination, laboratory testing, electrocardiography, chest radiography, comprehensive echocardiography including pulsed-wave Doppler examination, and CT of the chest.

Diagnosis

Severe coarctation of the juxtaductal aorta accompanied by an ascending aortic aneurysm, a bicuspid aortic valve without evidence of hemodynamically significant stenosis or regurgitation, and an atrial septal defect.

Management

An ascending-descending intrapericardial aortic bypass graft, atrial septal defect closure, and ascending aorta replacement were all successfully performed. Lifelong follow-up will be required.

Clinical Introduction

A 57-year-old woman presented to our clinic with breathlessness brought on while walking uphill. She had been recently diagnosed with systemic hypertension. There was no known family history of cardiac disease, or prior smoking habit. On examination, pulse was 73bpm and blood pressure 155/73mmHg, which was asymmetrical in her arms. Auscultation revealed a readily audible early diastolic murmur in the aortic area and bilateral subclavian bruits. ECG showed sinus rhythm with no abnormality. Transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated mild-to-moderate aortic regurgitation, and normal left ventricular size and function. The ascending aorta was mildly dilated (41mm), with para-aortic thickening noted. Owing to the abnormal appearance of the aortic wall, cardiac MRI, and subsequently 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) scan was performed (figure 1).

Clinical Characteristics of MVP

A diagnosis of MVP is not reliably made using clinical symptoms. In fact, patients with MVP appear to exhibit symptoms that have been previously attributed to MVP (dyspnea, chest pain, and electrocardiographic abnormalities) at an equivalent rate to patients without any identifiable prolapse. Even patients with quite severe regurgitation as a result of prolapse may be asymptomatic. As such, symptoms should not be used to diagnose MVP, although the presence of symptoms warrant further investigation. Physical exam findings that are associated with MVP include a lower body mass index and a mid‐systolic "click" heard best at the apex on cardiac auscultation. A late systolic or holosystolic murmur may be appreciated as well, and suggests the presence of mitral regurgitation. Thoracic, or bony abnormalities, as well as other extra‐cardiac findings may suggest the presence of MVP as part of a syndrome. Physical exam findings should also not be used to diagnose MVP, as the presence of any of these findings are not sensitive or specific enough to accurately make a diagnosis. Echocardiography is the gold standard for diagnosis, as it provides a high‐resolution and dynamic view of the three‐dimensional mitral valve, can quantify leaflet involvement, and is able to detect and quantify characteristics of more severe disease, such as annulus dilation, flail leaflet because of chordal rupture, and severity of regurgitation. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging may also have a place in the MVP workup, as it is exquisitely sensitive and specific, and is able to uniquely detect and quantify fibrosis in patients with MVP by measuring late gadolinium enhancement. Electrocardiography or 24‐hour Holter monitoring may also provide utility in the workup of MVP, as both atrial and ventricular arrhythmias may arise in these patients. Patients who experience an increased burden of premature ectopic beats (such as premature ventricular contractions [PVCs]) are at an increased risk of developing more severe, even life‐threatening arrhythmias. Many studies have reported a high PVC burden in patients with MVP. In a recent review of patients with MVP who experienced sudden cardiac death, 92% experienced PVCs on Holter monitoring, and in another electrophysiologic study, PVCs were identified as a trigger for more complex, life threatening arrhythmias in patients with MVP. As such, there is an opportunity to risk stratify patients with MVP using Holter monitoring, to identify subsets of patients who are at an increased risk for sudden cardiac death.

### A mysterious case of chest pain, dyspnea, and palpitations in a healthy young female: citalopram or robotic minithoracotomy? [^112r59nU]. JTCVS Techniques (2023). Medium credibility.

Case Presentation

A 56-year-old woman with a history of rheumatoid arthritis and gastroesophageal reflux disease presented to her local emergency department with complaints of faint dyspnea, palpitations, transient nonradiating chest tightness, and sensations of impending doom. Her symptoms were transient — lasting only seconds. Social, family, and surgical histories were unremarkable. Vital signs and physical exam were normal. Serum electrolytes, troponin T levels and electrocardiography were normal. She was diagnosed with "anxiety/gatroesophageal reflux disease" and instructed to see her primary care physician for further evaluation. During her encounter with her primary care physician, she was prescribed citalopram with planned follow-up in 6 weeks for reassessment.

Despite initiating anxiolytic therapy, her symptoms gradually worsened, and the patient's frustration prompted her to lose follow-up with her primary care physician. Two months later, she presented again to her local emergency department, now with orthopnea, sinus tachycardia, and worsening dyspnea. Physical examination revealed a mid-diastolic murmur loudest on the left, which radiated to the axilla. Computed tomography angiography revealed no pulmonary embolism. However, a large 5-cm mass was seen in the left atria that was initially believed to be thrombus (Figure 1). The decision was made to transfer her to our facility for inpatient hospitalization and further management. Upon arrival, we obtained a transthoracic echocardiography that revealed a large 4.8-cm × 3.1-cm pedunculated mobile mass attached to the interatrial septum that extended into the left ventricle during diastole, thus obstructing transmitral valve flow (Figure 2 and Videos 1–3). Serum interleukin 6 levels were twice the upper limit of normal at 3.9 pg/mL. She was then again transferred to a larger tertiary care facility where she successfully underwent robotic minithoracotomy with mass resection. Surgical pathology confirmed findings of cardiac myxoma. She tolerated the procedure well and had prompt resolution of her symptoms.

Ventricular arrhythmia (VA) evaluation — history, family history, medication review, and examination elements are detailed, including arrhythmia symptoms (palpitations, lightheadedness, syncope, dyspnea, chest pain, cardiac arrest) and symptoms of underlying heart disease (dyspnea at rest or on exertion, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, chest pain, edema), precipitating factors (exercise, emotional stress), known heart disease (coronary, valvular such as mitral valve prolapse, congenital), and risk factors (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, smoking). Medication review encompasses antiarrhythmic and other medications with potential for QT prolongation and torsades de pointes, medications with potential to provoke or aggravate VA, stimulants including cocaine and amphetamines, supplements including anabolic steroids, and medication‑medication interactions that could cause QT prolongation and torsades de pointes. Family history elements include SCD, SCA, or unexplained drowning in a first-degree relative; SIDS or repetitive spontaneous pregnancy losses; and heart disease with inherited conditions such as cardiomyopathy (hypertrophic, dilated, ARVC), congenital heart disease, cardiac channelopathies (Long QT, Brugada, Short QT, CPVT), arrhythmias, and conduction disorders or devices. Physical examination focuses on heart rate and regularity, blood pressure, jugular venous pressure, murmurs, pulses and bruits, edema, and sternotomy scars. The text also notes that obtaining a complete medication history is important, that various antiarrhythmic and other medications can cause QT prolongation and torsades de pointes, and that some medications can also induce Brugada type I electrocardiographic pattern and VF.

Within a period of only two weeks she developed progressive dyspnea, facial edema and facial erythema. Transthoracic echocardiography was repeated in our institution and revealed on average 1 cm thick masses on both surfaces of the leaflets of the tricuspid and mitral valves, suggestive of a rapidly progressing underlying pathology. To that point the patient's past medical history was significant for essential hypertension. There was no history of chest pain, dyspnea or fever. The patient's cardiac examination revealed no murmurs or extra heart sounds. The patient denied any use of tabaco or alcohol. On physical examination there was a Kussmaul's sign detectable on inspiration suggestive of an increased jugular venous pressure.

### Rapid expansion of the ascending aorta following fluoroquinolone therapy [^111dEgk7]. JTCVS Techniques (2025). Medium credibility.

Case Report

A 72-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and malignant lymphoma, in remission for 27 years, visited our hospital. She did not have any history of smoking or family history of cardiovascular disease. Three years ago, she presented with fever and joint pain and received antibiotic treatment, including fluoroquinolones, at another hospital. Because of her persistent symptoms, she was referred to our institution for further evaluation and management. Even with the continuation of the antibiotic therapy, our extensive investigations failed to identify a definitive cause for her fever. Her symptoms were resolved after a total of 53 days of fluoroquinolone administration (Figure E1).

Approximately 3 years later, she returned to our hospital complaining about palpitations and shortness of breath. A chest and abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan revealed rapid enlargement of the ascending aorta and thoracoabdominal aorta where the diameter had increased from 41 to 71 mm and from 25 to 35 mm, respectively, over a 3-year period, as well as moderate aortic regurgitation (Figure 1). Laboratory findings were unremarkable, and there were no clinical signs of infection. A carotid ultrasound revealed severe carotid artery tortuosity. Meanwhile, chest and abdominal CT scans did not show any evidence of aortic/systemic infections or anatomical abnormalities except for the AA. Minimal aortic wall calcification was also observed.

Figure 1
Three years ago (A) and just before surgery (B), preoperative computed tomography image showed that the diameter of the aorta was 41 mm and 71 mm.

Due to the presence of symptomatic aortic regurgitation and rapid aortic expansion, the patient underwent ascending and aortic arch replacement with a branched graft, as well as aortic valve replacement. There were no inflammatory changes, signs of infection, or adhesions in the outer layer of the aorta. The inner layer of the aorta was smooth with no visible entry points or scars (Figure E2). Her surgical recovery was uneventful, and she was discharged on postoperative day 23 after she had achieved independent ambulation. Pathological examination of the resected aorta revealed the loss of medial elastic fibers extending from the aneurysmal region to the distal aortic arch, but no elastic fiber rupture or false lumen was observed (Figure 2). Genetic testing for hereditary connective tissue disorders was performed using peripheral blood leukocytes during outpatient follow-up, but no pathogenic mutations were identified. To date, 1 year after surgery, the patient has not experienced any recurrence of the AA, and her recovery continues to be favorable.

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Evaluation of the cause of HF — history, physical examination, and family assessment should guide workup. Evaluation "begins with a thorough history and careful physical examination", and clinicians "should inquire about a history of hypertension; diabetes mellitus; dyslipidemia; tobacco use; coronary, valvular, or peripheral vascular disease; rheumatic fever;… mediastinal irradiation; sleep-disordered breathing; and exposure to cardiotoxic agents", and also ask about "illicit drug use, current and past alcohol consumption", and exposures to sexually transmitted diseases. The history and physical should consider noncardiac diseases including collagen vascular disease, infection, obesity, thyroid excess/deficiency, amyloidosis, and pheochromocytoma. The physical examination "should document specific signs of right or left HF, with particular attention to the presence of elevated jugular venous pressure and a third heart sound". A detailed family history should identify relatives with cardiomyopathy, sudden unexplained death, conduction system disease, and skeletal myopathies; "as many as 30% of cases of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy may be familial". Genetic testing is not routine, but "an electrocardiogram and echocardiogram should be considered in first-degree relatives", and families with multiple cases "should be referred to a center with expertise in genetic analysis and counseling".

Circulation (2021). High credibility.

Chest pain characteristics and corresponding causes — symptom quality, timing, location, and modifiers: Anginal symptoms are perceived as retrosternal chest discomfort (eg, pain, discomfort, heaviness, tightness, pressure, constriction, squeezing), and sharp chest pain that increases with inspiration and lying supine is unlikely related to ischemic heart disease. Anginal symptoms gradually build in intensity over a few minutes, whereas fleeting chest pain of few seconds' duration is unlikely to be related to ischemic heart disease. Sudden onset of ripping chest pain with radiation to the upper or lower back is unlikely to be anginal and is suspicious of an acute aortic syndrome, and pain that can be localized to a very limited area or radiating to below the umbilicus or hip is unlikely related to myocardial ischemia. Ripping chest pain, "worse chest pain of my life", especially when sudden in onset and occurring in a hypertensive patient or with a known bicuspid aortic valve or aortic dilation, is suspicious of an acute aortic syndrome. Physical exercise or emotional stress are common triggers of anginal symptoms, occurrence at rest or with minimal exertion associated with anginal symptoms usually indicates ACS, and positional chest pain is usually nonischemic. Relief with nitroglycerin is not necessarily diagnostic of myocardial ischemia and should not be used as a diagnostic criterion. Common symptoms associated with myocardial ischemia include dyspnea, palpitations, diaphoresis, lightheadedness, presyncope or syncope, upper abdominal pain, or heartburn unrelated to meals and nausea or vomiting, and symptoms on the left or right side of the chest, stabbing, sharp pain, or discomfort in the throat or abdomen may occur in patients with diabetes, women, and elderly patients.

Cardiac valvular lesions are seen in the majority of patients with the carcinoid syndrome and represent the most clinically significant consequence of the carcinoid syndrome. This case report discusses carcinoid tumors, the carcinoid syndrome induced by these tumors, and the therapeutic options in the management of carcinoid tumors.

### Palpitations in a 72-year-old woman [^112Aso9h]. Heart (2017). Low credibility.

Clinical Introduction

A 72-year-old woman presented with an 8-year history of palpitations occurring every few weeks. They were sudden in onset, were associated with dizziness and could last for up to 2hours. She was prescribed bisoprolol which reduced the frequency of events but did not abolish them. Baseline ECG and echocardiography were normal. She was referred for electrophysiological study. Despite initial difficulties, diagnostic catheters were placed in the right ventricular (RV) apex and in the coronary sinus (CS) via the right internal jugular vein and superior vena cava (SVC) (figure 1A). A narrow complex tachycardia was easily induced, and ablation was then delivered during tachycardia with the ablation catheter positioned as shown in (figure 1A). This terminated tachycardia 4s after onset of energy delivery and on follow-up she has remained asymptomatic. She later underwent a CT scan (figure 1B, C; online supplementary video).DC1SP110.1136/heartjnl-2017–311734.supp1Supplementary file 1 heartjnl;103/19/1554/F1F1F1Figure 1(A) Fluoroscopy of catheter placement.

A 46-year-old woman presented with worsening dyspnea and palpitations for 3 days following an episode of left shoulder pain. The patient had received a diagnosis of patent ductus arteriosus with Eisenmenger syndrome in childhood but had been inconsistently taking digoxin and diuretics since then. She was married but had never been pregnant. Over the previous 2 to 3 years, her exercise capacity had decreased significantly, with frequent episodes of near syncope and chest pain. She had developed bilateral leg edema. Three days prior to admission, she noticed an episode of severe, sharp pain in her left shoulder that was nonradiating but associated with palpitations and sweating and that lasted for about 20 min. The shoulder pain subsided spontaneously but her dyspnea worsened significantly, which prompted her to present to the ED.

### Trans-apical aortic valve implantation for quadricuspid aortic valve with aortic regurgitation using J-valve system: a case reports [^116gHMeK]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Quadricuspid aortic valve (QAV) is a rare congenital heart defect usually accompanied with different hemodynamic abnormalities. Due to the rarity of QAV, treatment and prognosis of QAV patients with aortic regurgitation still remain challenging. We here present the first case of a patient with severe QAV regurgitation who underwent successful treatment and performed favorable prognosis with transapical aortic valve implantation (TAVI) using J-Valve system.

Case presentation

A 62-year-old man experienced intermittent palpitation, shortness of breath and chest pain. Echocardiography revealed congenital QAV with massive aortic regurgitation and mild aortic stenosis, left ventricular enlargement. Aortic valve replacement was successfully performed with TAVI using J-Valve system. The postoperation and follow-up was uneventful.

Conclusion

TAVI using J-Valve system has emerged as a new high success rate method for treatment of patients with simple non-calcified aortic valve insufficiency.

Diagnosis of myocarditis — clinical symptoms: The initial step for a clinician in the assessment of a patient with possible myocarditis is to recognize that a clinical scenario is consistent with this diagnosis, and clinicians should be aware of 3 classic presentations — chest pain, arrhythmia, or heart failure (HF)/cardiogenic shock. The history of an antecedent viral infection in a young person, a prior diagnosis of myocarditis or autoimmune disease, a family history of cardiomyopathy or unexplained sudden death, or exposure to known cardiotoxin followed by related symptoms should raise the suspicion for this condition.

### Dyspnoea on exertion in a 53-year-old woman [^1115cKPw]. Heart (2017). Low credibility.

Clinical Introduction

A 53-year-old woman with no previous medical history complained of easy fatigue over the last 6 months. She had a positive family history for coronary artery disease but no other risk factors. On physical examination, a 3/6 pansystolic murmur was heard over the apex, and the lung auscultation was unremarkable. Her ECG showed a left anterior fascicular block, with poor R wave progression in the anterior leads (see online supplementary image A). A subsequent echocardiogram revealed a slightly dilated for the patient's body surface area (BSA) (1.73 m²) left ventricle (55/35mm), with preserved systolic function and a moderate functional mitral regurgitation. The estimated pulmonary artery pressure was 45mm Hg. During treadmill radionuclide scintigraphy, her exercise tolerance was normal, with good inotropic response, and 96% oxygen saturation at rest and at peak exercise. A 2mm ST segment depression was noted at peak effort, which persisted well into recovery (see online supplementary image B). The scintigraphy scan showed extensive reversible anteroapical wall ischaemia (see online supplementary image C). At this point she was referred to us for right and left heart catheterisation. Intracardiac pressures and saturations were: right atrium (RA)RA = 3mm Hg, right ventricle (RV) = 26/3mm Hg, Pulmonary artery (PA) = 26/10/mean 16mm Hg, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) = 11mm Hg, left ventricle (LV) = 110/10mm Hg, Aorta (Ao) = 110/60/mean 80mm Hg, Superior vena cava saturation (SVCsat) = 62%, RAsat = 62%, PAsat = 78%, Aosat = 96%and estimated pulmonary to systematic flow ratio (Qp/Qs) = 1.8.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2006). Medium credibility.

ACC/AHA/ESC 2006 ventricular arrhythmias — symptoms and hemodynamically stable ventricular tachycardia note that palpitations or a perception of cardiac rhythm irregularity may be caused by the whole spectrum of arrhythmias and can also occur without arrhythmia; patients with ventricular tachycardia may present with paroxysmal dyspnea or chest pain related to hemodynamic consequences; presyncope is a vague term, poorly defined and not specific, and ventricular tachycardia may cause undiagnosed syncope especially with structural heart disease; patients with poor ventricular function and inducible ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation have a high incidence of subsequent appropriate therapies when implanted with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), and similar patients may be at risk of sudden cardiac death; very rapid ventricular tachycardia such as torsades de pointes with repolarization syndromes will typically present with syncope or seizure rather than palpitations; in hemodynamically stable ventricular tachycardia, patients may be asymptomatic but more often sense rapid heart beating with dyspnea or chest discomfort, stability relates to tachycardia rate, retrograde conduction, ventricular function and peripheral compensatory mechanisms, stable presentations do not suggest absence of heart disease and can occur with very poor left ventricular function, and even patients with poor ventricular function may not notice palpitations during ventricular tachycardia.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

Physical examination in patients with chest pain: Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) may present with diaphoresis, tachypnea, tachycardia, hypotension, crackles, S3, or a mitral regurgitation murmur, and examination may be normal in uncomplicated cases. Pulmonary embolism is associated with tachycardia and dyspnea in > 90% of patients and pain with inspiration. In suspected aortic dissection, the frequency of syncope > 10% and aortic regurgitation (AR) 40%–75% (type A) are noted among findings. Esophageal rupture can present with emesis, subcutaneous emphysema, and pneumothorax (20% patients) with unilateral decreased or absent breath sounds. Other causes include pericarditis with fever, pleuritic chest pain, increased in supine position, and friction rub; myocarditis with fever, chest pain, heart failure, S3; pneumothorax with dyspnea and pain on inspiration and unilateral absence of breath sounds; costochondritis with tenderness of costochondral joints; and herpes zoster with pain in a dermatomal distribution triggered by touch and a characteristic rash.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) clinical interpretation — "clinical interpretation is the process of assessing variant pathogenicity in the context of the specific patient scenario", and "the clinical team should consider the laboratory classification, correlation of the gene to the clinical phenotype of the patient, and the family history and inheritance pattern". This step is "necessary when testing via a comprehensive multigene panel" that may include genes "with limited evidence", and for variants of uncertain significance (VUSs) "careful consideration is needed before acting clinically", because a variant may correlate clinically but "does not automatically meet the same prediction thresholds for clinical action", and "additional studies may be warranted to clarify causality". When suspicion remains, "testing of additional relatives may be informative", including cases where a variant is "de novo" or "tracks with the cardiac phenotype", and "working with a team experienced in cardiomyopathy genetics, including cardiac GCs, is essential", especially for VUS decisions.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

Chest pain characteristics and corresponding causes: Anginal symptoms are perceived as retrosternal chest discomfort including pain, discomfort, heaviness, tightness, pressure, constriction, or squeezing, whereas sharp pain that increases with inspiration and lying supine is unlikely related to ischemic heart disease and usually occurs with acute pericarditis. Anginal symptoms gradually build in intensity over a few minutes, while sudden onset of ripping chest pain with radiation to the upper or lower back is suspicious of an acute aortic syndrome. Pain that can be localized to a very limited area and pain radiating to below the umbilicus or hip are unlikely related to myocardial ischemia. Occurrence at rest or with minimal exertion associated with anginal symptoms usually indicates ACS, and relief with nitroglycerin is not necessarily diagnostic of myocardial ischemia and should not be used as a diagnostic criterion. Common associated symptoms include dyspnea, palpitations, diaphoresis, lightheadedness, presyncope or syncope, upper abdominal pain, or heartburn unrelated to meals and nausea or vomiting, and symptoms on the left or right side of the chest, stabbing or sharp pain, or throat/abdominal discomfort may occur in patients with diabetes, women, and elderly patients.

### Asymptomatic atrial fibrillation [^112hDSUH]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a significant cause of morbidity and health care expenditures. Patients with AF suffer a variety of symptoms including chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, and fatigue. Some patients have no symptoms, a condition referred to as asymptomatic or "silent" AF. Asymptomatic AF has significant clinical implications. Patients with unrecognized AF may present with devastating thromboembolic consequences or a tachycardia-mediated cardiomyopathy. The incidence of asymptomatic AF is greater than previously perceived. This manuscript provides an overview of the clinical entity of asymptomatic AF including the epidemiology, clinical significance, and the implications it has on the daily management of patients suffering from AF.

Athletes — ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death (SCD) preparticipation and evaluation: Preparticipation history and physical examination, including family history of premature or SCD and specific evidence of cardiovascular diseases such as cardiomyopathies and ion channel abnormalities, is recommended in athletes (Level of Evidence: C). Athletes presenting with rhythm disorders, structural heart disease, or other signs or symptoms suspicious for cardiovascular disorders should be evaluated as any other patient but with recognition of the potential uniqueness of their activity (Level of Evidence: C). Athletes presenting with syncope should be carefully evaluated to uncover underlying cardiovascular disease or rhythm disorder (Level of Evidence: B). Athletes with serious symptoms should cease competition while cardiovascular abnormalities are being fully evaluated (Level of Evidence: C). Twelve-lead ECG and possibly echocardiography may be considered as preparticipation screening for heart disorders in athletes (Level of Evidence: B).

### Diagnosis and management of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia [^112Ljm8a]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on atrial fibrillation:

- **Definition**: AF is a cardiac arrhythmia characterized by a diffuse and abnormal pattern of electrical activity in the atria of the heart. AF is classified as valvular or nonvalvular based on the presence or absence of valvular heart disease, specifically MS, or a prosthetic heart valve.
- **Pathophysiology**: The development of AF is related to structural and electrophysiological abnormalities resulting from comorbid conditions (including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, obesity, obstructive sleep apnea, myocardial infarction, HF), genetics, sex, and other factors.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of AF in the US ranges is estimated at 700–775 cases per 100,000 persons.
- **Disease course**: In patients with AF, rapid and irregular atrial contractions lead to tachyarrhythmias, which lead to symptoms of palpitations, dyspnea, and an increased risk of HF; as well as stasis of blood in the LAA, which increases the risk of stroke and systemic embolism.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: AF is estimated to cause 15% of all strokes and is associated with a 5-fold increased risk of stroke and a 2-fold risk for all-cause mortality, respectively.

### Bicuspid aortic valve disease: a comprehensive review [^115jMiaN]. Cardiology Research and Practice (2012). Low credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on bicuspid aortic valve:

- **Definition**: BAV is a common congenital cardiac abnormality consisting of two cusps instead of three that is characterized by dilatation of the thoracic aorta.
- **Pathophysiology**: The exact cause of BAV is unknown; however, genetic causes (Anderson syndrome, NOTCH1 mutation) have been implicated.
- **Disease course**: The fusion of the aortic cusps during valvulogenesis results in the BAV, which can cause clinical manifestations of severe aortic stenosis (symptoms of dyspnea, syncope, and chest pain), aortic regurgitation, aortic incompetence, aortopathy leading to aneurysm and dissection, infective endocarditis to asymptomatic disease.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: BAV in patients with definite infective endocarditis of the native aortic valve is associated with a 9% in-hospital mortality.

Bicuspid aortic valve — routine follow-up imaging: In patients with BAV and a diameter of the aortic sinuses or ascending aorta of ≥ 4.0 cm, lifelong serial evaluation of the size and morphology of the aortic sinuses and ascending aorta by echocardiography, CMR, or CT angiography is reasonable, with the examination interval determined by the degree and rate of progression of aortic dilatation and by family history. In patients with a BAV who have undergone aortic valve replacement (AVR), continued lifelong serial interval imaging of the aorta is reasonable if the diameter of the aortic sinuses or ascending aorta is ≥ 4.0 cm.

### Very late presentation of anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery: case report [^113jF48G]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA) is a rare congenital coronary anomaly. The enlarged right coronary artery provides retrograde collaterals to supply the left ventricle then preferentially directs into the lower pressure pulmonary artery system causing coronary steal phenomenon. Few patients who survive through adulthood without surgery must have abundant, well-formed functioning collaterals with adequate perfusion of the left ventricle. We present the oldest reported patient with ALCAPA to undergo corrective surgery.

Case Presentation

A 79-year-old woman presented with a 3-months history of worsening shortness of breath and orthopnea. Physical examination discovered a soft continuous murmur at the left upper chest. Transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated an unusual, tubular-like structure inside the interventricular septum with a turbulent flow from color Doppler. Moreover, there was a severe mitral regurgitation from posterior mitral leaflet restriction associated with ventricular remodeling in combination with mitral annular dilatation. Coronary angiography and coronary computed tomography angiography established the diagnostic hallmark of ALCAPA syndrome. Stress cardiovascular magnetic resonance perfusion imaging demonstrated no myocardial ischemia suggesting adequate collateral circulation. Remarkably, there was a left coronary ostial stenosis, which served as a protective mechanism against myocardia ischemia by limiting the steal effect. The patient successfully underwent the ligation of anomalous artery at its origin in combination with bioprosthetic mitral valve replacement. Her postoperative course was uneventful.

Conclusions

This case utilized multimodality imaging for delineating the course of abnormal vessels and helping to formulate therapeutic decision.

Chest pain characteristics and corresponding causes — Anginal symptoms are perceived as retrosternal chest discomfort (eg, pain, discomfort, heaviness, tightness, pressure, constriction, squeezing) and anginal symptoms gradually build in intensity over a few minutes, whereas fleeting chest pain of few seconds' duration is unlikely to be related to ischemic heart disease. Sharp chest pain that increases with inspiration and lying supine is unlikely related to ischemic heart disease, and sudden onset of ripping chest pain with radiation to the back is suspicious of an acute aortic syndrome. Pain localized to a very limited area or radiating below the umbilicus or hip is unlikely related to myocardial ischemia, and positional chest pain is usually nonischemic. Physical exercise or emotional stress are common triggers of anginal symptoms, and occurrence at rest or with minimal exertion associated with anginal symptoms usually indicates ACS. Relief with nitroglycerin is not necessarily diagnostic of myocardial ischemia and should not be used as a diagnostic criterion. Common symptoms associated with myocardial ischemia include dyspnea, palpitations, diaphoresis, lightheadedness, presyncope or syncope, upper abdominal pain, or heartburn unrelated to meals and nausea or vomiting; symptoms on the left or right side of the chest, stabbing or sharp pain, or throat/abdomen discomfort may occur in patients with diabetes, women, and elderly patients.

### Recurrent cardiogenic syncope from extrinsic organ anomaly [^114ovi7x]. Chest (2021). Medium credibility.

Case Presentation

A 40-year-old woman presented with recurrent syncope. She reported multiple (> 20) episodes of non-prodromal loss of consciousness, periodically provoked by physical exertion. One episode resulted in a nasal fracture due to the abrupt nature of her syncope. The characterization of each episode was inconsistent with a neurogenic seizure. Other causes of syncope (vasovagal, situational, carotid hypersensitivity, and orthostasis) were also deemed unlikely. On physical examination, a low-pitched, brief adventitious sound was appreciated after each S2 sound in the right lower sternal border. The remainder of the physical examination was unremarkable. Initial workup, including complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, cardiac enzymes, and ECG yielded normal results. The chest radiograph did not show any gross cardiac or pulmonary parenchymal pathologic condition (Fig 1). Telemetry did not demonstrate any malignant arrhythmias, and video-guided EEG did not document any seizure activity.

Case report

An 11-year-old female patient was admitted to our hospital with intermittent abdominal pain for more than 1 month. There was no previous medical history or family history of inherited disease in the patient's medical record. She had slight shortness of breath after activity but no other symptoms, such as chest pain, dyspnea or syncope. Upon physical examination, the temperature, respiratory rate, and heart rate were within normal limits. Furthermore, the patient presented with an arterial oxygen saturation level of 90% while breathing room air. During auscultation, An increased P2 (pulmonic) component of the second heart sound was finded. The lung sounds were unremarkable in all fields, and no abnormalities were detected during the abdominal examination. Blood analysis revealed an elevated hemoglobin level (218 g/L), red blood cell count (7.23 × 10¹²/L), and hematocrit (63.1%). The features of multiview TTE were as follows (Fig. 1): (A) The parasternal aortic long axis view revealed that the RPA, which possessed an internal diameter of 16 mm, originated from the posterior wall of the ascending aorta, approximately 27 mm from the aortic valve ring. Color Doppler flow imaging (CDFI) revealed continuous flow signals from the ascending aorta into the anomalous pulmonary artery. (B-C) The pulmonary artery long-axis view revealed the existence of an arterial duct between the LPA and the descending aorta, with an internal diameter of 6.6 mm, accompanied by red and blue bidirectional shunt flow signals. (D) The flow spectrum indicated a maximum velocity (V max) = 0.96 m/s and a pressure gradient (PG) = 4 mmHg; V max = -0.72 m/s, PG = -2 mmHg, for an estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure of 92 mmHg, whereas the measured brachial artery systolic pressure was approximately 94 mmHg. Further CT pulmonary artery angiography revealed the following (Fig. 2): (A) The RPA originated from the ascending aorta and had a lower density than the LPA did; (B) An arterial duct with an internal diameter of approximately 6.6 mm and a length of approximately 18 mm was observed between the starting part of the LPA and the descending aorta.

### 2021 AHA / ACC / ASE / CHEST / SAEM / SCCT / SCMR guideline for the evaluation and diagnosis of chest pain: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^111tS442]. Journal of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (2021). High credibility.

Chest pain characteristics and corresponding causes (Table 3) note that anginal symptoms are perceived as retrosternal chest discomfort and typically build in intensity over a few minutes. Sharp chest pain that increases with inspiration and lying supine is unlikely related to ischemic heart disease, and fleeting chest pain — of few seconds' duration — is unlikely to be related to ischemic heart disease. Sudden onset of ripping chest pain (with radiation to the upper or lower back) is unlikely to be angina and is suspicious of an acute aortic syndrome. Pain that can be localized to a very limited area or that radiates to below the umbilicus or hip is unlikely related to myocardial ischemia. Occurrence at rest or with minimal exertion associated with anginal symptoms usually indicates ACS, whereas positional chest pain is usually nonischemic. Relief with nitroglycerin is not necessarily diagnostic of myocardial ischemia and should not be used as a diagnostic criterion. Common symptoms associated with myocardial ischemia include dyspnea, palpitations, diaphoresis, lightheadedness, presyncope or syncope, upper abdominal pain, heartburn unrelated to meals, and nausea or vomiting; symptoms on the left or right side of the chest, stabbing or sharp pain, or throat/abdominal discomfort may occur in patients with diabetes, women, and elderly patients.

### Acquired ventricular septal defect secondary to aortic valve endocarditis [^116tuxCf]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 57-year-old male patient with a known history of Hodgkin's Lymphoma status post chemotherapy and chest radiation in 2008, alcohol use disorder, and chronic tobacco use presented to an outside hospital with chest pain, shortness of breath, night sweats, and low-grade fevers, for the past 7 days. During the physical examination, a murmur was heard over the left sternal border. Additionally, poor dentition with several missing teeth was noted. The patient met the criteria for systemic inflammatory response syndrome. Blood cultures detected gram-positive staphylococci and streptococcus anginous. Initial physical findings showed signs of congestive heart failure. Due to pressing concern for potential endocarditis, transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) and transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) were performed. Results showed aortic regurgitation, stenosis, and a mobile vegetation on the ventricular side of the valve that extended into the outflow tract. The patient was managed with antibiotics until transfer to a tertiary center.

### Missed aortic valve endocarditis resulting in complete atrioventricular block and redo mechanical valve replacement [^114BXiPJ]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Infective endocarditis is a rare disease associated with high morbidity and mortality. As a result, early diagnosis and prompt antibiotic treatment with or without surgical intervention is crucial in the management of such condition. We report a case of missed infective endocarditis of the aortic valve. The patient underwent mechanical aortic valve replacement, with the native valve being sent for histopathological examination. On re-admission 16 months later, he presented with syncope, shortness of breathing and complete heart block. On review of the histopathology of native aortic valve, endocarditis was identified which had not been acted on. The patient underwent redo aortic valve replacement for severe aortic regurgitation. We highlight the importance of following up histopathological results as well as the need for multidisciplinary treatment of endocarditis with a combination of surgical and antibiotic therapy.

### Successful management of cardiac electrical storm after aortic valve replacement using stellate ganglion block: a case report [^11294Nw7]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Case description

A 35-year-old male suffering with worsening chest distress and shortness of breath for one year was admitted to the Department of Cardiac Surgery. The patient with a well-controlled history of hyperthyroidism and normal thyroid function underwent a comprehensive examination. On physical examination, his blood pressure was 93/67 mmHg, and heart rate was 91 bpm. Lung breaths were clear. Cardiac examination revealed a grade 4/6 systolic murmur and a diastolic murmur in the auscultation area of the aortic valve. Transthoracic echocardiography showed a calcified, bicuspid aortic valve, severe stenosis, and moderate regurgitation, accompanied by hypokinesis of the left ventricular wall, the peak flow velocity of 3 m/s, peak across aortic valve gradient of 48 mmHg, mean gradient of 39 mmHg, and a calculated aortic valve area of 0.49 cm. And transthoracic echocardiography showed that moderate tricuspid regurgitation. The left ventricular end-diastolic diameter was 65 mm. The left ventricular ejection fraction was 40% and chest radiography revealed pulmonary venous hypertension. Coronary angiography showed no significant coronary stenosis. The patient with aortic valve stenosis was scheduled for aortic valve replacement and simultaneous tricuspid valvuloplasty. The patient experienced prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass time of 191 min and aortic cross-clamp time of 106 min. These prolonged times were due to the complexity of the surgical procedure and the need for meticulous repair of both the aortic and tricuspid valves. The patient was then transferred to our ward for surgery. Two hours later, telemetry electrocardiography (ECG) revealed wide QRS complex tachycardia (Fig. 1). Deep sedation, an intravenous β-block agent, and 18 shocks within 30 min were required to achieve rhythm control. Amiodarone was not administered because the patient had a history of hyperthyroidism. Transesophageal Echocardiography showed that the mechanical aortic and tricuspid valves were well functional. Postoperatively, the patient's peak troponin I levels reached 0.747 ng/mL, and peak CK-MB levels reached 29.1 U/L, indicating some degree of myocardial stress but no significant infarction. At that time, the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 41%. Malignant arrhythmias recurred when the sedation was discontinued. Meanwhile, deep sedation, intravenous β-block agents(esmolol), and 8 shocks for 10 min were required to achieve rhythm control (Fig. 2 A). Following adequated assessment, we performed an unilateral left stellate ganglion block (SGB). Base on the anatomical location of the cervical sympathetic ganglion, ultrasound-guided SGB was performed at the C6 and C7 levels, utilizing a short axial puncture to the surface of the longus colli and deep surface of the prevertebral fascia. The transverse processes of C6 and C7 were identified via ultrasound, confirming the positions of the nerve roots and vertebral arteries to delineate the puncture path for the SGB. The patient was successfully extubated within 24 h after sympathetic block and was discharged from the hospital 23 days after surgery in good condition. Two weeks after surgery, ECG showed a normal sinus rhythm and a normal PR interval (Fig. 2 B). One year after the surgery, the patient achieved complete resolution of symptoms and successfully resumed a normal and productive life. One year after surgery, the patient resumed a normal and productive life with relief of symptoms and good of the valve patency.

### Comorbidities and symptom status in moderate and severe aortic stenosis: a multicenter clinical cohort study [^113PKxPP]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

The long-held notion since Ross and Braunwald's publication in 1968that symptom onset in AS is discrete, easily identifiable and inexorably linked to AS severity must now be questioned for 3 reasons: 1) while dyspnea is more common in severe AS than moderate AS, it is common in moderate AS and the hemodynamic severity of AS does not accurately predict dyspnea; 2) that chest pain and syncope were strongly associated with coronary disease and pacemaker requirement, respectively, but not related to AS severity; and 3) the degree of valve obstruction is not the only pathophysiological mechanism involved in most patients, considering that ventricular fibrosis, diastolic dysfunction, and pulmonary hypertension are strong predictors of symptom development which in turn may be due to aortic stenosis and/or the interaction of multiple comorbidities. Although outcomes following AVR relate to the degree of cardiac damage at baseline, it remains unproven whether earlier AVR in symptomatic individuals with moderate AS would improve symptomatic status, heart failure progression or mortality. What is clear, however, is that traditional management decisions in AS based on a simple dichotomous threshold may be overly simplistic, and may lead to under-treatment of patients with a poor prognosis.

Study Limitations

Symptoms were extracted from cardiologist's clinical letters and based on clinical history taking rather than objective stress testing and observation of the degree of exercise impairment. However, reliability of cardiac symptoms extracted during a medical interview have been previously validatedand are recommended in current guidelines to guide treatment decisions. In addition, we did not use stress testing in symptomatic patients since current guidelines recommendations include stress testing only in the absence of reported symptoms.

The echocardiograms used in this study were undertaken for clinical indications for known or suspected cardiac disease and reported by cardiologists with expertise in echocardiography. No core laboratory was used, or retrospective image review undertaken. However, similar methodology has been utilized by our group and others with robust mortality outcomes. Individuals with AS that have not yet undergone echocardiography will not have been captured in this study, and therefore our results should not be taken to reflect the population prevalence of moderate and severe AS.

It is possible some patients may have had additional heart diseases not yet identified by the treating cardiologist. For example transthyretin amyloid (aTTR) may be found in 12% of patients with severe AS. This could have impacted the prevalence of dyspnea identified. It is important to note however, that every patient in this report has been reviewed by a board-certified cardiologist with expertise in clinical cardiology.

### Aortic valve regurgitation: a comprehensive review [^116p9EU2]. Current Problems in Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on aortic regurgitation:

- **Definition**: AR, also known as aortic insufficiency, is a structural heart disease characterized by diastolic flow of blood across the aortic valve, from the aorta into the left ventricle.
- **Pathophysiology**: AR may be due to malfunction of the valve leaflets themselves, dilatation of the aortic root and annulus, or a combination of these factors.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of AR in the US is estimated at 500 persons per 100,000 population.
- **Disease course**: Chronic AR causes volume overload of the left ventricle, with ventricular dilation and systolic dysfunction, and clinical symptoms of HF. Acute AR results in acute HF, and can progress to cardiogenic shock due to an uncompensated decrease in effective stroke volume.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Moderate or severe AR is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. In highly symptomatic patients (NYHA functional class 3–4), annual mortality rates of approximately 25% have been reported.

### A 56-year-old, otherwise healthy woman presenting with light-headedness and progressive shortness of breath [^1116i96a]. Chest (2016). Low credibility.

A 56-year-old white woman was referred to the pulmonary clinic for evaluation of unexplained shortness of breath. She enjoyed good health until 3 months prior to this visit when she reported experiencing recurrent episodes of shortness of breath and oppressive retrosternal chest discomfort with radiation to the neck. Episodes lasting 5 to 10 min often occurred at rest and were inconsistently related to physical activity. These symptoms became progressively worse and were often associated with light-headedness and presyncope. Her past medical history was uneventful apart from a prior diagnosis of breast cysts and suspected prolactinoma. Her symptoms escalated to such a level that she was forced to seek urgent medical attention at our institutional ED on two separate occasions in the preceding weeks. These visits precipitated a number of investigations and, eventually, a referral to the pulmonary clinic.

### Surgical resection of a rare biatrial giant sarcoma: a case report [^113bsb2P]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

Patient information

A 32-year-old female patient, measuring 150 cm in height and weighing 50 kg (BMI: 22.2 kg/m²), sought medical attention due to persistent abdominal pain and distension unrelieved by oral medications over the past week. The patient reported experiencing chest tightness and exertional dyspnea for over two weeks. She denied any history of hypertension or cardiovascular diseases, and there was no family history of genetic disorders. The patient had undergone a cesarean Sect. 10 months prior. On physical examination, her body temperature was 36.2 °C, blood pressure was 90/70 mmHg (1 mmHg = 0.133 kPa), and oxygen saturation was 93% while receiving oxygen at 2 L/min. Her respiratory rate was 18 breaths per minute, and her heart rate was 100 beats per minute with a regular rhythm. There was No precordial prominence was observed, and the apical impulse was located 0.5 cm lateral to the mid-clavicular line in the left 5th intercostal space. No murmurs were detected in any of the valve areas. Breath sounds were diminished bilaterally. The patient was conscious, exhibited generalized edema, and had experienced a weight gain of 5 kg in the past month.

Preoperative findings

Her echocardiogram showed solid echoes occupying the bilateral atrial cavities and the interatrial septum, measuring approximately 88 × 58 × 82 mm. The inferior margin of the mass extended to the orifices of the mitral and tricuspid valves (Fig. 1 A).

Left Heart Chambers and Function: The left atrial diameter was within normal limits, while the left ventricular diameter was slightly reduced. The left ventricular wall thickness was normal, and there were no abnormalities in the left ventricular outflow tract. Segmental systolic function of the left ventricle was normal, with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 62%. Mitral Valve: The mitral valve leaflets were not thickened and exhibitedshowed normal mobility. The forward flow velocity was increased, though valve opening was not significantly restricted. Continuous Wave (CW) Doppler measurements revealed a peak velocity of 2.1 m/s, a peak pressure gradient of 18 mmHg, and a mean pressure gradient of 7 mmHg. No mitral regurgitation was detected on color Doppler imaging.

### Asthma… [^112cnh3S]. Wikipedia (2002). Low credibility.

Asthma is a common long-term inflammatory disease of the bronchioles of the lungs. It is characterized by variable and recurring symptoms, reversible airflow obstruction, and easily triggered bronchospasms. Symptoms include episodes of wheezing, coughing, chest tightness, and shortness of breath. A sudden worsening of asthma symptoms sometimes called an 'asthma attack' or an 'asthma exacerbation' can occur when allergens, pollen, dust, or other particles, are inhaled into the lungs, causing the bronchioles to constrict and produce mucus, which then restricts oxygen flow to the alveoli. Asthma is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Environmental factors include exposure to air pollution and allergens. Other potential triggers include medications such as aspirin and beta blockers. Diagnosis is usually based on the pattern of symptoms, response to therapy over time, and spirometry lung function testing.

Asthma is classified according to the frequency of symptoms of forced expiratory volume in one second, and peak expiratory flow rate. It may also be classified as atopic or non-atopic, where atopy refers to a predisposition toward developing a type 1 hypersensitivity reaction. Associated conditions A number of other health conditions occur more frequently in people with asthma, including gastroesophageal reflux disease, rhinosinusitis, and obstructive sleep apnea. Psychological disorders are also more common, with anxiety disorders occurring in between 16 and 52% and mood disorders in 14–41%. It is not known whether asthma causes psychological problems or psychological problems lead to asthma. Use of antibiotics in early life had been linked to the development of asthma.

A later review found that previous studies came to inconsistent conclusions on the relationship between antibiotic use and asthma development, and that many failed to rule out respiratory infections as a confounding factor. Medical conditions A triad of atopic eczema, allergic rhinitis and asthma is called atopy. The strongest risk factor for developing asthma is a history of atopic disease; with asthma occurring at a much greater rate in those who have either eczema or hay fever. Asthma has been associated with eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, an autoimmune disease, and vasculitis. Individuals with certain types of urticaria may also experience symptoms of asthma. Beta blocker medications such as propranolol can trigger asthma in those who are susceptible. Cardioselective beta-blockers, however, appear safe in those with mild or moderate disease.

Other medications that can cause problems in asthmatics are angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, aspirin, and NSAIDs. Use of acid-suppressing medication during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of asthma in the child. There is currently no precise test for the diagnosis, which is typically based on the pattern of symptoms and response to therapy over time. Asthma may be suspected if there is a history of recurrent wheezing, coughing, or difficulty breathing, and these symptoms occur or worsen due to exercise, viral infections, allergens, or air pollution. Spirometry is then used to confirm the diagnosis. In children under the age of six, the diagnosis is more difficult as they are too young for spirometry. It however may be normal in those with a history of mild asthma, not currently acting up. As caffeine is a bronchodilator in people with asthma, the use of caffeine before a lung function test may interfere with the results.

### Fitness-related cardiac arrhythmias… [^115aMduP]. AAFP (2019). Medium credibility.

Most clinicians are aware of the well-established association between physical fitness and cardiac health. How many are aware, however, that high levels of physical fitness predispose patients to cardiac rhythm abnormalities. We were not — until each of us experienced one of the two most common serious fitness-related cardiac arrhythmias: atrial fibrillation/flutter and sinus bradycardia with ventricular tachycardia requiring pacemaker insertion. What constitutes high-level physical fitness. It is impossible to precisely define. It could refer to anyone from elite professional athletes to amateurs who run, cycle, or exercise regularly at their local gyms. In all of those cases, the level of exercise and the fitness it engenders far exceed the population norm. There is no known exercise threshold above which fitness-related arrhythmias occur, and unidentified individual patient factors are likely involved.

Fitness-Related Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter Most cases of atrial fibrillation/flutter occur in older adults with coronary artery disease, valvular disease, or other heart disease. It can also occur in individuals — most commonly middle-aged adults and sometimes younger persons — who have high levels of physical fitness and no underlying heart disease or medical conditions. Atrial fibrillation is the most common serious fitness-related arrhythmia. Multiple studies have reported that the rate of atrial fibrillation in endurance athletes is two to 10 times greater than in controls. 1 It is estimated that for every 10 years of regular endurance exercise, the risk of atrial fibrillation increases by about 16%, and the risk of atrial flutter increases by 42%.

2 Well-known athletes, such as tennis icon Billie Jean King and basketball star Larry Bird, have developed atrial fibrillation/flutter — some when they were as young as 30 to 40 years of age. Episodes of atrial fibrillation/flutter can occur during exercise or at rest. Although the etiology is uncertain, a variety of causes have been suggested, mostly focusing on atrial remodeling due to exercise-related pressure overload in the atrium, high vagal tone, or the inflammatory mediators that circulate when individuals have sore muscles. 3–5 Direct inflammation of the atrium from the adjacent esophagus may contribute to these atrial arrhythmias in patients with acid reflux. 6, 7. Fitness-related atrial fibrillation/flutter should be suspected when athletic individuals who are in their 30s or 40s or older report symptoms such as palpitations, shortness of breath, or dizziness when they are at rest or exercising.

If the symptoms are occasional and atrial fibrillation/flutter is not confirmed with resting electrocardiography, a cardiac event monitor can be used to detect the arrhythmia, with the duration of monitoring determined by the anticipated frequency of the patient's symptoms. Once an arrhythmia is confirmed, the patient should be asked about the use of performance-enhancing stimulants, although it is not clear whether they contribute to atrial fibrillation/flutter in athletes. 8 More importantly, underlying heart disease should be excluded using echocardiography, exercise stress testing, and, when indicated, cardiac computed tomography angiography or cardiac catheterization. Additional testing for other potential causes or exacerbating factors such as hyperthyroidism and electrolyte abnormalities should be individualized.
