## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for the volume of a pyramid formed by folding six isosceles triangles onto a regular hexagonal base. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the base area of the regular hexagon. Then, I should determine the slant height of the pyramid by analyzing the isosceles triangular faces. Next, I will calculate the pyramid's height using the Pythagorean theorem. Finally, I will apply the pyramid volume formula and match the result to the given options, verifying each step along the way.

> Let me first confirm the base geometry. A regular hexagon with side length 6 can be divided into six equilateral triangles, each with side 6, so the area of the hexagon is 6 times the area of one equilateral triangle. The area of an equilateral triangle with side s is (√3/4)s², so the base area B is 6 × (√3/4) × 6² = 6 × (√3/4) × 36 = 54√3. Wait, let me verify that arithmetic: 6 × 36 = 216, and 216/4 = 54, so yes, B = 54√3 square units [^notfound].

> Next, I should review the triangular faces. Each isosceles triangle has two sides of length 8 and a base of 6, and when folded, those two equal sides become the slant heights of the pyramid. Hold on, I should verify the slant height concept: in a right pyramid, the slant height is the altitude of a triangular face from the base edge to the apex, so here the slant height l is 8. I need to ensure I'm not confusing slant height with pyramid height; they are different, and I will compute the pyramid height next [^notfound].

> I will now examine how to find the pyramid height h. The apex lies directly above the center of the hexagon, so I can form a right triangle with hypotenuse equal to the slant height l = 8, and one leg equal to the apothem of the hexagon. Let me think about the apothem: for a regular hexagon of side 6, the apothem is the altitude of one of the equilateral triangles, which is (√3/2) × 6 = 3√3. So, by the Pythagorean theorem, h² + (3√3)² = 8², which gives h² + 27 = 64, so h² = 37 and h = √37. Wait, let me double-check that calculation: 3√3 squared is 9 × 3 = 27, and 64 − 27 is indeed 37, so h = √37 units [^notfound].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about the volume yet. I should confirm the volume formula and plug in the values. The volume V of a pyramid is (1/3) × base area × height, so V = (1/3) × 54√3 × √37. Let me simplify that: (1/3) × 54 = 18, so V = 18√(3 × 37) = 18√111. Hmm, wait a minute, none of the answer choices match 18√111, which means I must have made a mistake somewhere. Let me reconsider the slant-height interpretation and the geometry of the fold [^notfound].

> I should double-check the folding geometry. Initially, I assumed the two sides of length 8 in each isosceles triangle become the slant heights, but wait, let me verify whether that places the apex at the correct height. If the apex is directly above the center, the distance from the center to the midpoint of a base edge is the apothem 3√3, and the slant height should satisfy l² = h² + (3√3)², which with l = 8 gives h = √37 as above. But since 18√111 is not an option, I need to consider whether the "two sides of length 8" are not the slant heights but rather the equal legs of the isosceles triangles that meet at the apex, implying the slant height is actually the altitude of the isosceles triangle with base 6 and two sides 8. Let me calculate that altitude: splitting the isosceles triangle gives two right triangles with hypotenuse 8 and base 3, so the altitude is √(8² − 3²) = √(64 − 9) = √55. So the true slant height is √55, not 8, and I should correct my earlier assumption accordingly [^notfound].

> Now, with the correct slant height l = √55, I will recalculate the pyramid height. Using the same right triangle formed by the height, the apothem, and the slant height, I have h² + (3√3)² = (√55)², so h² + 27 = 55, which gives h² = 28 and h = √28 = 2√7. Let me verify: 2√7 squared is 4 × 7 = 28, and 28 + 27 = 55, which matches, so h = 2√7 units [^notfound].

> I will now apply the volume formula with the corrected height. V = (1/3) × base area × height = (1/3) × 54√3 × 2√7. Simplifying, (1/3) × 54 = 18, and √3 × √7 = √21, so V = 18 × 2√21 = 36√21. Let me double-check the arithmetic: 18 × 2 = 36, and √3 × √7 = √(3 × 7) = √21, so yes, V = 36√21 cubic units [^notfound].

> Finally, I should confirm the answer choice. 36√21 corresponds to option C, so the correct answer is C. I briefly worried that I might have misapplied the Pythagorean theorem or the base area, but correcting the slant height from 8 to √55 resolved the mismatch and aligned the result with option C [^notfound].

---

The volume of the pyramid is **36√21**. Here's how I got there: the base is a regular hexagon with side 6, so its area is (3√3/2) × 6² = 54√3. Each isosceles triangular face has base 6 and two sides of 8, so the slant height is √(8² − 3²) = √55. The pyramid's height is then √(55 − (3√3)²) = √28 = 2√7. Thus, the volume is (1/3) × 54√3 × 2√7 = **36√21**.

## Step 1: Calculate the area of the hexagonal base

A regular hexagon can be divided into 6 equilateral triangles. The area of one equilateral triangle with side length (s) is:

[
\\text{Area}_{\\text{triangle}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2
]

For (s = 6):

[
\\text{Area}_{\\text{triangle}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} \\times 6^2 = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} \\times 36 = 9\\sqrt{3}
]

The total area of the hexagonal base is:

[
\\text{Area}_{\\text{base}} = 6 \\times 9\\sqrt{3} = 54\\sqrt{3}
]

---

## Step 2: Determine the slant height of the pyramid

Each isosceles triangle has a base of 6 and two sides of 8. The slant height (l) is the height of this triangle, calculated using the Pythagorean theorem:

[
l = \\sqrt{8^2–3^2} = \\sqrt{64–9} = \\sqrt{55}
]

---

## Step 3: Calculate the height of the pyramid

The height (h) of the pyramid forms a right triangle with the slant height and the apothem of the hexagonal base. The apothem (a) of a regular hexagon with side length 6 is:

[
a = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\times 6 = 3\\sqrt{3}
]

Using the Pythagorean theorem:

[
h = \\sqrt{l^2 - a^2} = \\sqrt{55 - (3\\sqrt{3})^2} = \\sqrt{55–27} = \\sqrt{28} = 2\\sqrt{7}
]

---

## Step 4: Calculate the volume of the pyramid

The volume (V) of a pyramid is given by:

[
V = \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\text{Base Area} \\times \\text{Height}
]

Substituting the values:

[
V = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 54\\sqrt{3} \\times 2\\sqrt{7} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 108\\sqrt{21} = 36\\sqrt{21}
]

---

The volume of the pyramid is **36√21**, which corresponds to option C.

Crystalline cluster-based H-bonded icosahedral assembly

Inspection of the rhombic dodecahedral crystal habit in the case of 1 is unexpected among crystalline forms of coinage metallic clusters, which is evocative of an example of icosahedral viruses crystallized into cubic crystals in a similar dodecahedral shape. This inspire us to conjecture that extraordinary arrangement and packing of cluster tectons might exist. To our delight, the most attractive structural feature of 1 is that twelve molecular copper clusters per unit cell self-assemble into an enclosed approximately icosahedral capsule denoted as Cu 60 (Fig. 1d) with an approximate diameter of 3.0 nm. The surface of the pseudo icosahedron contains two types of triangular faces (Fig. 1e): 8 equilateral triangles and 12 isosceles triangles, each equilateral triangle with side lengths of 16 Å (the centroid-centroid distances of two adjacent clusters) and each isosceles triangle with side and base lengths of 16 and 13 Å, respectively. It is worth noting that this is the only possible combinatorial outcome for the pseudo icosahedron buckled from these equilateral triangles and isosceles triangles, based on the ChatGPT prediction. The internal hollow icosahedral capsule Cu 60 could accommodate a sphere with a diameter of about 25 Å, corresponding to a sphere volume of ~8177 Å. Our observation of the supramolecular icosahedral assembly that involves solid-state aggregation of individual clusters is intriguing. It was previously reported that atomically precise metal nanoclusters functionalized with capsid-targeting ligands which were used to label specific components of the surface of enteroviruses created icosahedral arrangement of clusters,. But once the absence of capsid-targeting ligands and without linking to the viral surfaces, cluster-based icosahedra are difficult to achieve. More importantly, the atomically accurate cluster-based icosahedral capsule will provide much more detailed information for further identifying the possible assembled origin of the icosahedron as the largest of the Platonic solids.

Discussion

Overall, the complex self-assembly achieved in this series of isomeric compounds arises from the decreasing effective chain length at constant chain volume (Fig. 7). The simple hexagonal honeycomb (Fig. 7a), observed for 20/0 and 16/4 is the intrinsically preferred structure based on the ratio of side-chain volume to rod length. Although for all compounds m/n the length of the side chains is sufficient to reach the centre of the hexagonal channel, increasing chain stretching required for the shorter chains becomes entropically unfavoured. Replacing hexagonal by the smaller pentagonal channels allows the chains to retain high disorder (see Supplementary Note 3), but at the expense of stretching two sides of the pentagons and thus breaking some hydrogen bonds at the apices (Fig. 4d). The remaining hexagons in the complex Col hex 2 structure of 14/6 are believed to serve to partially relieve the frustration of pentagonal packing of a Euclidean plane (Figs 4b and 7b). In the same manner, insertion of hexagons is required in a pentagonally tiled spherical surface as the sphere radius increases (as, for example, in the case of fullerenes). It is worth noting that interesting tiling patterns, including quasiperiodic, have been observed with moleculesand colloidal particlesof a pentagonal symmetry.

Producing 3D ssDNA knots

The design procedures presented here can also be applied to create 3D architectures with arbitrary geometries. We demonstrated the versatility of our method by constructing four ssDNA polyhedral meshes: a tetrahedron, a square pyramid, a triangular prism, and a pentagonal pyramid with crossing numbers 15, 20, 22, and 25, respectively (Fig. 4). A Schlegel diagram was used to transfer the 3D objects to their topologically equivalent 2D nets. Optimized folding pathways were designed carefully for step-wise hierarchical assembly and the corresponding ssDNA strands were designed, synthesized, and assembled. AFM images showed an abundance of well-folded 3D nanoparticles with the expected sizes (Supplementary Figures 13 – 16 and Supplementary Tables 4 – 7). Single particle cryo-EM 3D reconstruction revealed that the overall conformations matched the designed geometries well (Fig. 4, Supplementary Figures 17, 18, and Supplementary Table 8). Notably, the vertex design for our ssDNA knots was different from the multi-arm junction design based on the double-crossover (DX) motif,. Instead, there is a 5 bp difference in length between the two parallel dsDNAs that form each edge, leading to chiral vertices and inclined edges in the ssDNA knots (Fig. 4). This unique geometric feature could be used to identify conformational diastereomers, which is when the structure is turned inside out, while satisfying all programmed Watson–Crick base pairing with the same network connectivity. The 3D reconstruction data suggested that the ssDNA knots preferred to point the major grooves inwards at the vertices. A similar feature had been previously observed for the wireframe DNA nanostructures,.

### A general method for the creation of dilational surfaces [^6025b588]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Dilational structures can change in size without changing their shape. Current dilational designs are only suitable for specific shapes or curvatures and often require parts of the structure to move perpendicular to the dilational surface, thereby occupying part of the enclosed volume. Here, we present a general method for creating dilational structures from arbitrary surfaces (2-manifolds with or without boundary), where all motions are tangent to the described surface. The method consists of triangulating the target curved surface and replacing each of the triangular faces by pantograph mechanisms according to a tiling algorithm that avoids collisions between neighboring pantographs. Following this algorithm, any surface can be made to mechanically dilate and could, theoretically, scale from the fully expanded configuration down to a single point. We illustrate the method with three examples of increasing complexity and varying Gaussian curvature.

### Design principles for rapid folding of knotted DNA nanostructures [^48b17cc7]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Knots are some of the most remarkable topological features in nature. Self-assembly of knotted polymers without breaking or forming covalent bonds is challenging, as the chain needs to be threaded through previously formed loops in an exactly defined order. Here we describe principles to guide the folding of highly knotted single-chain DNA nanostructures as demonstrated on a nano-sized square pyramid. Folding of knots is encoded by the arrangement of modules of different stability based on derived topological and kinetic rules. Among DNA designs composed of the same modules and encoding the same topology, only the one with the folding pathway designed according to the ‘free-end' rule folds efficiently into the target structure. Besides high folding yield on slow annealing, this design also folds rapidly on temperature quenching and dilution from chemical denaturant. This strategy could be used to design folding of other knotted programmable polymers such as RNA or proteins.

### Design principles for rapid folding of knotted DNA nanostructures [^37480ea4]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Owing to its programmable nature, predictability of its stability and straightforward synthesis, DNA is an almost ideal prototyping material for designing nanostructures. To date, a plethora of structures, from small topological constructsto megadalton two-dimensionaland three-dimensionalassemblies, has been reported. An important constraint for the folding of knotted single-chain DNA polyhedrais threading of knots, which requires the correct order of folding steps. Although thermodynamic optimization works well for simpler structures, robust design principles to control folding of increasingly complex single-chain DNA polyhedra, which could be extended to alternative biopolymers (for example, RNA and proteins), are needed.

Here we define rules to guide the folding of highly knotted single-chain DNA nanostructures based on defining the order of formation of duplex modules according to their stability. A ‘free-end' rule states that at each folding step the favourable folding design must involve at least one pairing segment with a free end, allowing its threading through the preformed structure. We prove that such a design is theoretically always possible. Coarse-grained simulations demonstrated the validity of this rule, and that threading of long tails through small loops is kinetically hindered. Folding of DNA square pyramids composed of the same modules and encoding the same topology revealed that only the design with the folding pathway designed according to the ‘free-end' rule folds efficiently into the target structure. Besides high folding yields on slow annealing, this design also folds rapidly on temperature quenching and dilution from chemical denaturant.

### Inverse design of 3D reconfigurable curvilinear modular origami structures using geometric and topological reconstructions [^52f732dd]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Figure 4 presents an example of reconfigurable structures assembled with varying geometry and topology of modules for a target DOF. Applying the geometric modification in Eqs. (3)–(6) and topological reconstruction in Eqs. (7)–(10) to 28 unit cells within a volumetric mapping size of 40,, we obtain sphere reconfigurable structures for various target DOFs. Our algorithm provides multiple solutions, e.g. multiple combinations of geometry and topology for a target. For example, unit cell #1 with a mapping size ofand unit cell #22 with a mapping size ofprovide several topological options with varyingfor target mobility, as shown in Fig. 4.

We plot the DOFs with varying connecting topology while demonstrating various deformation modes, including uniaxial extension and volumetric shrinkage, as shown in Fig. 4 d, e (see the transformation in Supplementary Movie 5). The mobility can also be validated using a linear eigenmode analysis.

The same unit cell, e.g. a cubic unit cell, provides different reconfigurability depending on the variation of the topological connections, which is controlled by the mapping size. Small-sized polyhedrons with amapping can provide a vaster design space in mobility than large-sized polyhedrons with amapping because of the greater chance of available topology, as illustrated in Fig. 4. A unit cell consisting of two tetrahedrons and one octahedron with amapping produces a maximum of 40 connections, resulting in zero mobility, as illustrated in Fig. 3a. Even releasing the connection only produces a narrow range of design space in mobility because of the extruded tubular shapes of the tetrahedron and octahedron being a triangular lattice prism with kinematic mobility of zero.

### Triangular prism-shaped β-peptoid helices as unique biomimetic scaffolds [^1a0f248c]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

β-Peptoids are peptidomimetics based on N-alkylated β-aminopropionic acid residues (or N-alkyl-β-alanines). This type of peptide mimic has previously been incorporated in biologically active ligands and has been hypothesized to be able to exhibit foldamer properties. Here we show, for the first time, that β-peptoids can be tuned to fold into stable helical structures. We provide high-resolution X-ray crystal structures of homomeric β-peptoid hexamers, which reveal right-handed helical conformations with exactly three residues per turn and a helical pitch of 9.6-9.8Å between turns. The presence of folded conformations in solution is supported by circular dichroism spectroscopy showing length- and solvent dependency, and molecular dynamics simulations provide further support for a stabilized helical secondary structure in organic solvent. We thus outline a framework for future design of novel biomimetics that display functional groups with high accuracy in three dimensions, which has potential for development of new functional materials.

### Versatile kit of robust nanoshapes self-assembling from RNA and DNA modules [^8eeab1b0]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Isolation and characterization of nanoshapes

The kinetic and thermodynamic stability of the RNA-DNA-11 assemblies was demonstrated by extraction of individual bands from a gel and re-analysis by PAGE showing stable single bands (Fig. 2a). Gel purification provided pure samples of individual RNA-DNA-11 assemblies for imaging by atomic force microscopy (AFM). In agreement with PAGE analysis including RNA size marker, AFM imaging of the RNA-DNA-11 combination revealed a mixture of clean polygonal nanoshapes, ranging from triangles to hexagons, devoid of larger aggregates (Fig. 2b, Supplementary Fig. 6). Perimeter analysis of nanoshapes observed by AFM revealed discrete peaks representing polygon classes, from triangles to hexagons (Fig. 2c). The peak spacing at multiples of 8 nm corresponds to the side length of polygons assembled from RNA corner modules that are connected by a DNA-11 insert. Each side of these nanoshapes contains a total of 31 bp, including 8 bp of RNA-RNA double strand combined in the two corner modules, 11 bp of DNA-DNA in the DNA-11 insert and 12 bp of RNA-DNA hybrid combined in the two overlapping regions between insert and corners (Supplementary Figs. 1, 2). The polygon side length of 8 nm as measured by AFM suggests that all bp in the nanoshape sides adopt the A form conformation with a characteristic rise/bp of 0.26 nm, amounting to a predicted length of 8.1 nm for a helix of 31 bp.

### Glassiness and exotic entropy scaling induced by quantum fluctuations in a disorder-free frustrated magnet [^fd792599]. Nature Communications (2014). Medium credibility.

Proving the perimeter scaling of entropy

The hexagon representation for the sign state of each bipyramid allows us to establish bounds on the number of LC states, N (L, V), for a system of volume V and circumference L. We find that, where K 1, K 2 are constants. In particular, for V ~ L 2, we have:, concluding that (up to a possible logarithmic correction) the number of states is extensive in the boundary length.

The lower bound is easy to establish: for a given boundary length L, we can construct explicitly a number of states which scales as. One way of doing so is by starting from one of the long-range structures as shown in Fig. 1d,e and Supplementary Fig. 6. These structures support straight quasi one-dimensional modes that change the state of the bipyramid along them. For a square sample of side L, we can put up to L -independent parallel modes of this type, which supplies us with the lower bound.

To show the upper bound, we recast the sign states as a tiling problem. We use the hexagonal tiles depicted in Fig. 1c to obtain a representation of the system as a network of lines (see also Supplementary Figs 5 and 6). The resultant network may be considered as a fully packed network of rectilinear stripes of alternating colour on a lattice, made of straight lines, π /6 degree turns (‘elbows’) and junctions as shown in Fig. 3b. The network has the following properties (for detailed discussion, see Supplementary Note 1): P1. Lines cannot terminate, and P2. There are no closed loops. Property P1 can be verified by inspection of possible termination points, and ruling each of them out. To prove property P2, assume the contrary and consider a closed loop of black colour, inside which there must be loops of smaller and smaller sizes. As the colours alternate, we must have an enclosed simply connected region that is entirely black or entirely blue. As we do not have an entirely blue or entirely black hexagon in our disposal, such a region must be of limited thickness, therefore the inner region must be made of lines with termination points. By property P1, such termination points are not allowed.

The adhesive layer was parallelly aligned with certain intervals. The width of the adhesive layer (w a) was calculated from the interior angles ɵ and the diameter of the peeled-off film, d, where w a = (180− ɵ) π d /360. The intervals are equal to the corresponding side length. Taking right triangle with interior angles of 60° and the shortest side length of 10 mm as an example, the diameter of peeled-off PTFE film (thickness of 80 μm, width of 4 mm) with Kapton tape as the adhesive layer and a peeling angle of 180° is 2 mm; thus, the widths of adhesive layers should be 2.62, 1.57, 2.09 and 2.62 mm, respectively, and the corresponding intervals should be 17.3, 10 and 20 mm, respectively (Fig. 3e). The PTFE film (thickness of 80 μm, width of 4 mm) was adhered vertical to the adhesive layer and peeled off at peeling angle of 180°. For an isosceles right triangle with a short side length of 10 mm, the widths of adhesive layers should be 2.36, 1.57, 2.36, and 2.36 mm, respectively, and the corresponding intervals should be 10, 10, and 14.1 mm, respectively. For an equilateral triangle with a side length of 10 mm, the widths of adhesive layers should be 2.09, 2.09, 2.09, and 2.09 mm, respectively, and the corresponding intervals should be 10, 10 and 10 mm, respectively. For the equilateral polygon with a side length of 10 mm, the widths of adhesive layers are 1.57, 1.26, and 1.05 mm with intervals of 10 mm for quadrangle, pentagon and hexagon, respectively.

### The representation of geometric cues in infancy [^3bf27a75]. Infancy (2008). Low credibility.

There is evidence that, from an early age, humans are sensitive to spatial information such as simple landmarks and the size of objects. This study concerns the ability to represent a particular kind of spatial information, namely, the geometry of an enclosed layout-an ability present in older children, adults, and nonhuman animals (e.g., Cheng, 1986; Hermer & Spelke, 1996). Using a looking-time procedure, 4.5- to 6.5-month-olds were tested on whether they could distinguish among the corners of an isosceles triangle. On each trial, the target corner was marked by a red dot. The stimulus (triangle with dot) appeared from different orientations across trials, ensuring that only cues related to the triangle itself could be used to differentiate the corners. When orientations were highly variable, infants discriminated the unique corner (i.e., the corner with the smaller angle and two equal-length sides) from a nonunique corner; they could not discriminate between the two nonunique corners. With less variable orientations, however, infants did discriminate between the nonunique corners of the isosceles triangle. Implications for how infants represent geometric cues are discussed.

When we select the same module topologically as the spherical structure in Fig. 3a.6 for the cone and hyperboloid structures in Fig. 3 c, d, the modular origami structures produce the same spatial connection topology and the same reconfigurable mobility (see Supplementary Movie 4). Therefore, the reconfigurability is controlled by the spatial connection of the modules and not by the geometry of the template.

Mobility evaluation

We implement transformation by obtaining the independent dihedral angles, as demonstrated in Figs. 3 b–d and 4. Following the assumption of the rigid face and flexible hinges of prismatic modular origami, we identify the independent dihedral angles from a linearized constraint matrix. We apply additional kinematic constraints on every vertex: the distance between two vertices on an edge remains constant during reconfiguration (see Supplementary Fig. 8 in the SI for further details). While linearizing the constraints with a matrix form, we obtain, whereis the infinitesimal displacement of vertices. We can also obtain the infinitesimal displacement of all the dihedral angles as. In matrix form, the constraints can be expressed as

### Hierarchical self-assembly of DNA into symmetric supramolecular polyhedra [^f10dd599]. Nature (2008). Excellent credibility.

DNA is renowned for its double helix structure and the base pairing that enables the recognition and highly selective binding of complementary DNA strands. These features, and the ability to create DNA strands with any desired sequence of bases, have led to the use of DNA rationally to design various nanostructures and even execute molecular computations. Of the wide range of self-assembled DNA nanostructures reported, most are one- or two-dimensional. Examples of three-dimensional DNA structures include cubes, truncated octahedra, octohedra and tetrahedra, which are all comprised of many different DNA strands with unique sequences. When aiming for large structures, the need to synthesize large numbers (hundreds) of unique DNA strands poses a challenging design problem. Here, we demonstrate a simple solution to this problem: the design of basic DNA building units in such a way that many copies of identical units assemble into larger three-dimensional structures. We test this hierarchical self-assembly concept with DNA molecules that form three-point-star motifs, or tiles. By controlling the flexibility and concentration of the tiles, the one-pot assembly yields tetrahedra, dodecahedra or buckyballs that are tens of nanometres in size and comprised of four, twenty or sixty individual tiles, respectively. We expect that our assembly strategy can be adapted to allow the fabrication of a range of relatively complex three-dimensional structures.

E Sample cryo-electron micrograph of the eventual structure (scale bar: 10 nm).

To evaluate the scalability and generality of the design procedure, we designed and synthesised a number of 2D and 3D wireframe nanostructures. The details of the design process and the experimental protocols are presented in the Methods section. Briefly, a desired 2D or 3D mesh was first generated and rendered into short ssDNA splints according to our strand routing and nicking scheme (Fig. 1D). With the strand arrangement determined, segmentation and pairing information were used to generate the respective sequences. Structure formation was optimised for annealing protocols, strand concentration and buffer condition, as confirmed by native agarose gel electrophoresis, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) (Fig. 1E).

2D wireframes

As indicated in an earlier study, the geometric constraint of full face triangulation serves as an effective approach to maintain a defined geometry. We first designed a collection of 2D wireframe nanostructures based on fully triangulated meshes and six-arm junction motifs. Although the length of the edges in the mesh model can be arbitrary, the rendered DNA duplex lengths were rounded to be multiples of full turns (10.5 base pairs) so that the 5´ and 3´ ends of each strand in a duplex domain are on the same side, as desired in the routing. The duplexes were segmented into complementary domains according to a standardised scheme (Supplementary Fig 1). After a systematic investigation of different spacer lengths on a 16 × 3 (columns × rows) rectangular array of triangular faces (Supplementary Fig 2), three consecutive unpaired T bases (3 T spacer) were added at each junction to relax tension at the junction crossovers.

2 METHODS

2.1 Trajectory design

2.1.1 Tilted hexagonal grids

Fast 3D Fourier encoding is often achieved by stacking identical 2D readouts in the third dimension. EPI and Archimedean spirals then form 2D Cartesian grids in planes orthogonal to the read direction. These planes, which are parallel for EPI and radial about the principal axis of the stack for spirals, shall be referred to as phase‐encoding (PE) planes. However, Cartesian sampling is usuallly suboptimal. Structures with approximately circular or elliptical support are sampled more efficiently on hexagonal grids.,In parallel imaging with undersampling, the greater isotropy of hexagonal patterns improves the conditioning of image reconstruction for a given mean sampling density.,

Spiral and EPI trajectories can readily be stacked in such a way that they cover hexagonal grids in their PE planes (Figure 1A). However, due to the finite feasible length of individual readouts, one shot may not suffice to cover an entire nominal k‐space plane when targeting high resolution. The common solution to this problem is to segment each plane into N interleaved shots. However, due to the inflexibility in time allocation arising from N being an integer, it is often impossible to optimize the sequence timing for contrast and SNR as discussed more closely in the Supporting Information.

Hexagonal superlattice of compound 14/6

For compound 14/6, with a reduced difference between branches m and n, the small angle reflections between ∼130 and 145 °C can be indexed as (11), (21), (30), (22), (31), (32), (50), (33) and (51) of a hexagonal lattice. Interestingly, the (10) and (20) reflections are very weak or completely missing (Fig. 4a), which indicates a structure significantly different from that of Col hex 1. Here, the hexagonal lattice parameter a hex =9.72 nm corresponds to about 4 L mol ; therefore, a simple hexagonal honeycomb as in 20/0 and 16/4 can be excluded. The electron density map (Fig. 4b) of this Col hex 2 structure indicates the presence of a more complex superlattice. There are small regular hexagons with low-density alkyl centres (red), each surrounded by six giant hexagons with threefold symmetry and alternating side lengths, corresponding to L mol and 2 L mol, respectively (Fig. 4b–d). These latter hexagons, containing nine molecules in their circumference (9-hexagons, indicated by solid white lines in Fig. 4b), are further divided into triplets of pentagons (dotted lines). However, the pentagonal cells within the 9-hexagons appear to be poorly ordered, as the electron-density difference between their walls and their cell interior is reduced (green/blue). This suggests some structural disorder, which is likely to result from the extended (1.17-fold) length of those inner walls compared with the outer walls of the 9-hexagon (see Supplementary Note 3). This mismatch and the overcrowding of the pentagonal channels by the alkyl chains may be responsible for the disorder inside the 9-hexagons, which could provide an entropic advantage for this structure (see Fig. 4b,d).

### Inverse design of 3D reconfigurable curvilinear modular origami structures using geometric and topological reconstructions [^2430fa4f]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Figure 2 shows the geometric modification of an architected structure constructed using the geometric reconstruction. Unlike the initial architected structure in Fig. 2a, the modified configuration in Fig. 2b makes the prismatic tubes deformable to their maximum range of motion while maintaining the macroscopic sphere shape. Note that the prismatic tubes in the initial configuration have limited motion, as illustrated in Fig. 2d ; however, the prismatic tubes of the modified configuration are flat-foldable, as illustrated in Fig. 2e. Notably, the geometric modification maximizes the sole foldability of individual prismatic tubes.

After the geometric modification, we search through all the possible geometric and topological combinations of each module, applying the graph theory in the assembly. A graph consists of vertices and edges representing modules and tubular connections, as shown in Fig. 3 a.3, a.8. To attain the target mobility, we formulate a search algorithm of reconfigurable structures.whererepresents the-th module andis a collection of all modules for the-th shrunken polyhedron.is the total number of modules in the assembly.is the DOF for the combinationwhereis a basis of vector.

### Mechanism of DNA origami folding elucidated by mesoscopic simulations [^4d7c2b6a]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

At some point, with remarkable consistency, this 4HB structure experiences a collapse event whereby the scaffold transitions from the two-stranded structure established in the first phase of folding into a “proto rod” structure, possessing roughly the shape of the final structure but significantly swollen and shorter, and lacking global order. This transition appears to occur via a cooperative zipping process mediated by partially bound staples resolving their third connection to the scaffold in a successive manner along the length of the scaffold, starting where the scaffold bends to accommodate this change (Fig. 3d inset and 3e, f). It is possible that this zipping motion is a critical event that is required to overcome the penalty of constraining the partially assembled scaffold to itself. Furthermore, it is noted that the loops formed opposite the zipping boundary are sterically repelled and thus splay, hence the tendency for only a single side to begin zipping (Fig. 3e, red arrows). It is our interpretation that the increased excluded volume surrounding the binding sites following collapse into the proto rod (thereby reducing the accessibility of binding sites) is responsible for the subsequent reduction in kinetic rate, whereby the folding proceeds as a slower first-order process until the final staple binds and forms the completed structure.

To better characterize this collapse mechanism, we computed the time-resolved Landau-de Gennes parameter, which describes the crystallinity of structures, that is, the global alignment of backbone tangent vectors, wherecorresponds to a completely straight backbone anda completely disordered chain (see Methods). Although the structure crystallizes significantly by the end of the simulation, the observed collapse into a proto rod does not correspond to a significant increase in crystalline order (Fig. 3c); the structure instead collapses into a locally ordered but globally disordered structure, after which crystallinity is established gradually as additional staples bind. This is corroborated by calculation of a parameterwhich describes the number of nonbonded scaffold neighbor contacts that have not yet been realized in the structure (see Methods). Our results show that almost all nonbonded neighbors make contact very early during folding, with little improvement afterward (Fig. 3d), while the crystallinity parameter increases gradually but significantly (Fig. 3c). This indicates that this structure establishes local order before it establishes global order; the severity with which this occurs should depend on the staple to scaffold ratio.

Development of mathematical IgM–VSG coat binding interface model

To approximate the binding “footprint” of a pentameric IgM molecule on the VSG coat, we first modeled the VSG coat as a regularly spaced hexagonal grid, as has been shown in previous studies. A regular hexagon of height h has six sides of length equal to (h /3 1/2). A hexagon with a height of 40 nm (the upper estimate of the diameter of an IgM molecule) thus has sides of length ~23.1 nm. If such a hexagon has five VSG homodimers on each side, they will be equally spaced at ~5.8 nm (23.1 nm/4 inter-homodimer spaces), a value extremely close to previously estimated homodimer spacing (5.7 nm spacing with a random displacement up to 0.5 nm). Filling this hexagon with additional VSG homodimers at the same spacing, we estimated that 61 VSG homodimers (or 122 VSG monomers) would be within reach of a single IgM with a 40 nm diameter (Fig. 4b, c). The same calculations were performed for IgM with a 30 nm diameter (Supplementary Fig. 4): 30 nm/3 1/2 gives a side length of ~17.3 nm. Assuming four VSG homodimers on each side, they will again be equally spaced at ~5.8 nm (17.3 nm/3 inter-homodimer spaces). Filling this hexagon results in 37 VSG homodimers (or 74 VSG monomers) within reach of a single IgM with a 30 nm diameter.

### A ferromagnetically coupled Fe42 cyanide-bridged nanocage [^71823669]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

The most remarkable structural feature of 1 ·18H 2 O is that the 18 Fe III-HS ions can be identified as the vertices of a highly symmetric entity shown in Fig. 2. First, 12 Fe III-HS centres in {Fe(NC) 4 (dpp)(H 2 O)} units are defined as the vertices of cuboctahedron, all of whose sides have a length of 7.85 Å. Second, six square windows of the cuboctahedron are stellated with 24 isosceles triangles, each with side lengths of 6.83, 6.83 and 7.85 Å, with six vertices defined by Fe III-HS ions from {Fe(NC) 4 (H 2 O) 2 } units. The Fe II – CN – Fe III linkage of 1 ·18H 2 O classify it as a Prussian blue analoguefrom the standpoint of its electronic state. Prussian blue analogues exhibit in a molecule-based framework with cyanide-bridging akin to the three-dimensional Prussian blue compound Fe III 4 [Fe II (CN) 6] 3 · x H 2 O. Prussian blue shows ferromagnetic behaviour with a Curie temperature T c of 5.5±0.5 K (ref.). The observed ferromagnetism involves a long-range order of the Fe III ions. While 1 ·18H 2 O is much more complex than Fe III 4 [Fe II (CN) 6] 3 · x H 2 O, the cyanide bridging units between the Fe III ions are similar. The shortest Fe III – Fe III distances for Prussian blue and 1 ·18H 2 O are 7.2 Å and 6.8 Å through space and 10.2 Å and 9.9 Å along the Fe III – NC – Fe II – CN – Fe III units, respectively. Accordingly, it is reasonable that the 18 Fe III-HS (S =5/2) ions, at the vertices in 1 ·18H 2 O, are coupled ferromagnetically.

### Fractal modes and multi-beam generation from hybrid microlaser resonators [^29f660d7]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Fractal modes for three and four microsphere topologies

We observe fractal laser modes in the interstices of a microsphere array that are encompassed by three or more spheres. Owing to the reflectivity of polystyrene or silica spheres at grazing incidence, diffraction losses in the resonator of Fig. 1a are reduced in the vicinity of the sphere/water (gain medium) interface and fractal modes appear. Furthermore, the fractal modes associated with specific microsphere arrangements appear to be unique to that geometry. Both three and four sphere topologies have been examined and, for interstitial regions encompassed by three spheres, four distinct fractal laser modes have been observed. Two of these resemble the Sierpinski Triangle and one matches the prediction of Fresnel diffraction simulations. The ability afforded by microfabrication techniques to position microspheres precisely on a mirror surface allows for a desired fractal mode to be produced and to pattern the requisite sphere arrangement over substantial areas.

A light scattering system devised by Sweet et al. comprising reflecting spheres arranged in the form of a trigonal pyramid, yielded fractal patterns in the light intensity distribution emerging from any of the four optical ports (“basins”). In the present experiments, the top sphere of the ref.pyramid has been removed, and a symmetric resonator is realized in which microsphere ensembles in the form of quasi-triangles, rectangles, etc. are positioned between two mirrors (Fig. 1a). Figure 2 is a representative microscope image of a portion of an array of 200 μm diameter spheres within the resonator of Fig. 1a. Recorded in plan view (oriented toward the bottom mirror) with a 20 × microscope objective, this micrograph was acquired with a single pulse of the pump laser, and the spatial scale at lower right indicates a length of 25 μm. The interstice at upper right (where dashed white circles denote the perimeters of the three bordering spheres) shows a laser fractal mode, and a second, weaker mode is developing in the inter-sphere gap at lower right. The dominant feature of the stronger transverse laser mode comprises two superimposed triangles forming a “Star of David” pattern, lying at the junction of three larger triangles separated azimuthally by 120 o. Another unanticipated aspect of the experimental results reported here is that of coupled fractals, illustrated by the inset to Fig. 2 (lower left). In this case, two of the spheres have been separated intentionally and the extension of laser radiation beyond the 3-sphere interstice is evident.

Red and yellow dots mark the points of the hexagonal grid that are covered by two subsequent shots. Green lines in the background show that all points of the hexagonal grid lie on nodes of a finer, rectilinear lattice, from which the starting angle of each spiral shot can be derived. Subsequent shots start with linearly progressing angles. The pattern is repetitive. E, Background: An entire mono‐planar T‐Hex stack of spirals cut open. The uppermost shot and the sites of puncture of the spirals are marked in dark gray. The resulting hexagonal grid shows the tilt as visualized in (C) and (D).

### From molecular to macroscopic via the rational design of a self-assembled 3D DNA crystal [^7b5f59e7]. Nature (2009). Excellent credibility.

We live in a macroscopic three-dimensional (3D) world, but our best description of the structure of matter is at the atomic and molecular scale. Understanding the relationship between the two scales requires a bridge from the molecular world to the macroscopic world. Connecting these two domains with atomic precision is a central goal of the natural sciences, but it requires high spatial control of the 3D structure of matter. The simplest practical route to producing precisely designed 3D macroscopic objects is to form a crystalline arrangement by self-assembly, because such a periodic array has only conceptually simple requirements: a motif that has a robust 3D structure, dominant affinity interactions between parts of the motif when it self-associates, and predictable structures for these affinity interactions. Fulfilling these three criteria to produce a 3D periodic system is not easy, but should readily be achieved with well-structured branched DNA motifs tailed by sticky ends. Complementary sticky ends associate with each other preferentially and assume the well-known B-DNA structure when they do so; the helically repeating nature of DNA facilitates the construction of a periodic array. It is essential that the directions of propagation associated with the sticky ends do not share the same plane, but extend to form a 3D arrangement of matter. Here we report the crystal structure at 4 A resolution of a designed, self-assembled, 3D crystal based on the DNA tensegrity triangle. The data demonstrate clearly that it is possible to design and self-assemble a well-ordered macromolecular 3D crystalline lattice with precise control.

3D-printed networks contain regular and irregular packing

To explore the relationship between θ DIB and the packing arrangements of droplets, we constructed 3D droplet networks comprising hundreds of picolitre-sized aqueous droplets (PBS, 100 µm diameter, ≈524 pL volume) using our laboratory-built 3D printer. To form a network, 224 droplets were automatically generated at a droplet ejection frequency of 0.5 s −1, and positioned line-by-line and layer-by-layer according to an hcp design (x, y and z dimensions of 7, 8 and 4 droplets, respectively) (Fig. 2a ; Supplementary Note 2). The droplet networks were formed on plasma-treated quartz, unless otherwise stated.

### Automated sequence design of 2D wireframe DNA origami with honeycomb edges [^6061ac32]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Design of variable vertex numbers

Staple sequences designed by METIS following scaffold routing are validated experimentally by one-pot mixing and folding of DNA strands with an annealing temperature ramp and characterizing structural formation using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging. We compared the structural fidelity of 6HB-based 2D wireframe origami of different degrees of N -arm junctions with DX-based design from PERDIX (Fig. 2). We analyzed three objects including the square, pentagon, and hexagon of 84-bp edge length assigned to the shortest edge (Supplementary Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 1). AFM indicated that all DX-based objects generally formed well (Fig. 2a–c ; left in each panel, Supplementary Figs. 3 – 5) and are structurally stiffer than single-duplex edge structures. However, the pentagon and hexagon were still relatively flexible compared with the square because more unpaired scaffold and staple nucleotides were introduced to accommodate 5′- and 3′-end misalignments between every two neighboring connected duplexes at the central vertex (Supplementary Table 1). In contrast, 6HB-based DNA origami objects of variable vertex numbers showed successful formation of designed geometries with vertices of high structural fidelity even when higher order vertex numbers were produced (Fig. 2a–c ; right in each panel and Supplementary Figs. 6 – 8). As expected, the designed internal vertex was precisely controlled using both 6HB edges and multiway connections crossing the vertex, leading to the formation of variable arm junctions of controlled number. To further characterize 6HB-based DNA assemblies, each object was visualized with TEM (Fig. 2d). Wide-field view TEM imaging showed in each case that particles are well folded and monodisperse (Supplementary Figs. 9 – 12). To test the generality and robustness of our autonomous sequence design procedure, we also applied it to the hexagon with 63-bp edge length. Full-field AFM and TEM imaging of the same folded samples (Supplementary Figs. 13 and 14) revealed high rates of proper formation with precisely controlled internal angles of vertices.

### Inverse design of 3D reconfigurable curvilinear modular origami structures using geometric and topological reconstructions [^72affa89]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Next, we connect the shrunken polyhedrons by extruding prismatic tubes on each shared face inside the template, as shown in Fig. 1e. Equations (1) and (2) are applied to the generation of tubes to connect adjacent shrunken polyhedrons. We apply a different construction method for the tube on the exterior boundary surface of a shrunken polyhedron, which was at the boundary of the template before the volumetric shrinkage. The tubular lengthgenerated along the exterior boundary surface in Fig. 1d is determined by the distance between the template and the exterior surface of a shrunken polyhedron along its average normal direction. After the geometric reconstruction, we obtain a nonperiodic modular origami structure with a curvilinear boundary, as shown in Fig. 1e. Note that the connected tubes serve as structural components, whereas the shrunken polyhedrons function as porous holes. See the synthesis in Supplementary Movie 1.

We can build other complex nonperiodic modular origami structures using the geometric reconstruction with the volumetric mapping into an arbitrary target shape and volumetric shrinkage of deformed polyhedrons, as illustrated in Fig. 1 f–j. Additional examples of the geometric reconstruction are provided in Supplementary Fig. 3 in the Supplementary Information (SI). Although we focus on nonperiodic modular origami structures in this work, our synthesis method of the spatial architected materials can also be applied to planar cases, as illustrated in Supplementary Fig. 1 of the SI, demonstrating that our design method is universal.

Construction of reconfigurable structures

Although the geometric reconstruction generates arbitrary 3D curvilinear structures through volumetric mapping and volumetric shrinkage of unit cells, the constructed origami structures hardly produce reconfigurability. From a macroscopic perspective, the fully connected origami modules with fully extruded tubes produce spatial loops, constraining the motion of the modules. Note that a module denotes a single origami unit constructed by the extruded tubes from the shrunken polyhedrons after geometric reconstruction, as illustrated in Fig. 2a. One can select rigid or flexible modules depending on their geometry and topology. From a microscopic perspective, the extruded prismatic tubes of irregular shrunken polyhedrons limit the range of motion of the whole assembly, as shown in Fig. 2 (see also Supplementary Fig. 4 of the SI).

### A universal state and its relaxation mechanisms of long-range interacting polygons [^8b86753c]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Methods

Experimental details

Our system is made up of Nd 2 Fe 14 B magnetic particles with various shapes: disc, hexagon, pentagon, square and triangle, and all particles are coated with a smooth nickel layer. We show the top and side views of the particles in Supplementary Fig. 1. In the x – y plane, all polygons have a center-to-vertex distance 3.00 ± 0.03 mm and the discs have a radius of 3.00 ± 0.03 mm; in the z direction, all particles have the thickness 2.97 ± 0.03 mm. The particles have a strong permanent magnetization along the z direction, with a maximum magnetic field B ~ 0.5 T at the magnetic poles. In the x - y plane, the anisotropic magnetic field can extend its influence to large distances of multiple particle size. Using a force sensor, we can directly measure the repulsive interaction force between two particles, with different relative orientations (e.g. edge-to-edge, edge-to-tip, and tip-to-tip), as shown in Supplementary Fig. 2a, b for square and triangle particles, respectively. The force profile is close to a power-law, F ~ r −4.2 (or an interaction potential U (r) ~ r −3.2). Significant anisotropy can be observed at small and medium r. With these magnetic particles, we can study single-particle behaviors in systems with long-range and anisotropic interactions.

We confine the particles between two glass plates to form a single-layer 2D system. The thickness of the spacer is carefully controlled at 3.12 ± 0.04 mm, which ensures that the particles do not tilt significantly (the tilting angle is less than 5 degrees) in all experiments. To provide external excitations, we use a plate with randomly pinned magnets slowly moving back and forth under the 2D system, with an amplitude A = 420 mm and period T = 4.9 s, as illustrated in Supplementary Fig. 3 and Supplementary Movie 1. The perturbation strength can be controlled by the distance H between the perturbation plate and the system confining box. After each set of perturbations (50 cycles), the perturbation plate is removed, and the system relaxes into a new mechanical equilibrium configuration, which sits at one specific local minimum of the potential energy landscape. We record plenty of such local minima configurations (typically more than 500) and probe their transition kinetics.

### How urban form impacts flooding [^8122e4b4]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Our simulations resolve flooding within the pore space between buildings, and solutions reflect the bulk effect of building form drag. Moreover, using a Godunov-type finite volume scheme for solving the shallow-water equations allows us to resolve supercritical flows, subcritical flows, and flows with hydraulic jumps. Solutions include localized super-critical flows (F r > 1) along steep slopes, but average flows across neighborhoods are found to be largely sub-critical (F r < 1). As has been observed in experiments, simulations show that a hydraulic jump occurs when localized supercritical flows encounter obstructions.

Figure 2 a–f show the color map of non-dimensionalized flood velocity in the downslope direction (u D 2 / Q) as a function of flow velocity (u), flow rate (Q), and building size (D), for neighborhoods of varying porosity and disorder. Relative to square symmetry at ϕ = 0.6, we observe the choking of flow with decreasing χ 4. This indicates that increasing disorder restricts the flood flow in urban forms that possess a near square symmetry (regular layout), but has an opposite effect in synthetic urban models with nearly hexagonal symmetry (or a staggered layout) representative of flow paths along diagonal directions. In particular, at ϕ = 0.6, the disorder opens new flood flow pathways through clusters of buildings much akin to flow pathways through disordered granular media.

The qualitative study of flow pathways in synthetic urban forms shows the impact of urban porosity, order, and chord length on flood velocity distribution.

Non-dimensionalized flood velocity maps for unit cells of urban forms with (a – c) square and (d – f) hexagon-like patterns with porosity ϕ =0.6 and Mermin order χ =1.0, 0.8, and 0.6, respectively. The color bar on the right represents the velocity scale for all velocity maps. Gray squares represent flow obstructions. While the unit cell l u is ~ 33 D, the channel length is set to 20 l u to mitigate size effects. The normalized chord length distributionfor each urban form is placed below each velocity map in panels (g – l); see the text for the definition.

### Oriented cell division shapes carnivorous pitcher leaves of sarracenia purpurea [^6c9f9196]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

where S i is the area of cell i, L j is the length of edge j, L k is the length of outermost edge k, and K S, K B, K R, K E and L E are constants. The first term of the right-hand side represents area elasticity, where cell i has a target area s i that depends on its edge number N i and is given by the relative area of N i -sided regular polygon to that of regular hexagon, namely, s i = N i tan(π /6)/6 tan(π / N i). K S denotes the elastic constant. The second term describes the conservation force of edge length, where each edge has the target lengthat which the potential energy function reaches a minimum. This condition ensures that neighbouring vertices do not become extremely close because of repulsive force. The third term indicates the elastic force that maintains the outermost edges at a constant length L E with the elastic coefficient K E, which reflects that the outer cell wall is usually thickened and stiffened by a cuticle.

In animal cell models, it is usually assumed that vertices are reconnected to mimic cell movement if an edge becomes extremely short. In contrast, because the plant cell wall prevents changes in the relative position of cells, such reconnection process is not permitted in our model. In addition, neighbouring vertices are prohibited to be extremely close by potential energy as described above.

Programmes were written in C and the vertex position (x j) was iteratively calculated every time step Δ t =0.005, using the fourth-order Runge–Kutta method.

Global twist deformation in a square-lattice

The object termed Twisttower (Fig. 1c) is a complex of four cuboid-like domains fused together. The cuboids feature 2 × 2, 4 × 4, 6 × 6, and 8 × 8 helices, respectively, in a quadratic cross-sectional arrangement (Fig. 2a). The Twisttower design allowed us to systematically study twist deformations, and how they may be removed, in a square-lattice packing context as a function of cross-sectional area. In the cryo-EM map that we determined, each cuboid domain exhibited an independent right-handed twist deformation around the helical axis of the domain (Fig. 2a). Such twist deformations are expected to arise a priori for square-lattice designs with default eight-base-pair crossover spacing because the design specifics create right-handed internal torques. These torques are produced by helical underwinding from 10.5 to 10.67 base pairs per turn imposed by the square-lattice connectivity. The global twist observed in each Twisttower domain decreased with the increasing cross-sectional area (Fig. 2a, left). To remove the global twist deformation, the internal design specifics must be changed such that the right-handed internal torques are mechanically balanced by counteracting left-handed torques. This may be achieved by locally deviating from the default eight-base-pair crossover spacing design rules following previously discussed concepts, by reducing the average bases between crossovers to achieve the native 10.5 base pairs per turn. We thus designed and solved a cryo-EM structure of a refined variant of the Twisttower in which we eliminated the global twist deformations. As a result, we obtained a more orderly object with a more regular square-lattice structure (Fig. 2a, right).

### Complex shapes self-assembled from single-stranded DNA tiles [^84f12b1b]. Nature (2012). Excellent credibility.

Programmed self-assembly of strands of nucleic acid has proved highly effective for creating a wide range of structures with desired shapes. A particularly successful implementation is DNA origami, in which a long scaffold strand is folded by hundreds of short auxiliary strands into a complex shape. Modular strategies are in principle simpler and more versatile and have been used to assemble DNA or RNA tiles into periodic and algorithmic two-dimensional lattices, extended ribbons and tubes, three-dimensional crystals, polyhedra and simple finite two-dimensional shapes. But creating finite yet complex shapes from a large number of uniquely addressable tiles remains challenging. Here we solve this problem with the simplest tile form, a 'single-stranded tile' (SST) that consists of a 42-base strand of DNA composed entirely of concatenated sticky ends and that binds to four local neighbours during self-assembly. Although ribbons and tubes with controlled circumferences have been created using the SST approach, we extend it to assemble complex two-dimensional shapes and tubes from hundreds (in some cases more than one thousand) distinct tiles. Our main design feature is a self-assembled rectangle that serves as a molecular canvas, with each of its constituent SST strands--folded into a 3 nm-by-7 nm tile and attached to four neighbouring tiles--acting as a pixel. A desired shape, drawn on the canvas, is then produced by one-pot annealing of all those strands that correspond to pixels covered by the target shape; the remaining strands are excluded. We implement the strategy with a master strand collection that corresponds to a 310-pixel canvas, and then use appropriate strand subsets to construct 107 distinct and complex two-dimensional shapes, thereby establishing SST assembly as a simple, modular and robust framework for constructing nanostructures with prescribed shapes from short synthetic DNA strands.

### Feasibility and coexistence of large ecological communities [^02d41162]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Shape of the feasibility domain

So far, we have focused on the volume of the parameter space resulting in feasiblity. However, two systems having the same Ξ can still have very different responses to parameter perturbations, just as two triangles having the same area need not to have sides of the same length (Fig. 1). The two extreme cases correspond to (a) an isotropic system in which if we start at the barycentre of the feasibility domain, moving in any direction yields roughly the same effect (equivalent to an equilateral triangle); (b) anisotropic systems, in which the feasibility domain is much narrower in certain directions than in others (as in a scalene triangle). For our problem, the domain of growth rates leading to coexistence is—once the growth rates are normalized—the (S −1)-dimensional generalization of a triangle on a hypersphere. For S =3, this domain is indeed a triangle lying on a sphere as shown in Fig. 1. If all the S (S −1)/2 sides of this (hyper-)triangle are about the same length, then different perturbations will have similar effects on the system. On the other hand, if some sides are much shorter than others, then there will be changes of conditions which will more likely have an impact on coexistence than others. We therefore consider a measure of the heterogeneity in the distribution of the side lengths (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Note 10). The larger the variance of this distribution, the more likely it is that certain perturbations can destroy coexistence, even when Ξ is large and the perturbation small. This way of measuring heterogeneity is particularly convenient because it is independent of the initial conditions. Moreover, the length of each side can be directly related to the similarity between the corresponding pair of species (Supplementary Note 10), drawing a strong connection between the parameter space allowing for coexistence and the phenotypic space. As in the case of Ξ, this measure is a function of the interaction matrix and corresponds to a geometrical property of the coexistence domain.

### Programmable self-assembly of three-dimensional nanostructures from 10, 000 unique components [^ee2318ed]. Nature (2017). Excellent credibility.

Nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) are widely used to construct nanometre-scale structures with ever increasing complexity, with possible application in fields such as structural biology, biophysics, synthetic biology and photonics. The nanostructures are formed through one-pot self-assembly, with early kilodalton-scale examples containing typically tens of unique DNA strands. The introduction of DNA origami, which uses many staple strands to fold one long scaffold strand into a desired structure, has provided access to megadalton-scale nanostructures that contain hundreds of unique DNA strands. Even larger DNA origami structures are possible, but manufacturing and manipulating an increasingly long scaffold strand remains a challenge. An alternative and more readily scalable approach involves the assembly of DNA bricks, which each consist of four short binding domains arranged so that the bricks can interlock. This approach does not require a scaffold; instead, the short DNA brick strands self-assemble according to specific inter-brick interactions. First-generation bricks used to create three-dimensional structures are 32 nucleotides long, consisting of four eight-nucleotide binding domains. Protocols have been designed to direct the assembly of hundreds of distinct bricks into well formed structures, but attempts to create larger structures have encountered practical challenges and had limited success. Here we show that DNA bricks with longer, 13-nucleotide binding domains make it possible to self-assemble 0.1-1-gigadalton, three-dimensional nanostructures from tens of thousands of unique components, including a 0.5-gigadalton cuboid containing about 30,000 unique bricks and a 1-gigadalton rotationally symmetric tetramer. We also assembled a cuboid that contains around 10,000 bricks and about 20,000 uniquely addressable, 13-base-pair 'voxels' that serves as a molecular canvas for three-dimensional sculpting. Complex, user-prescribed, three-dimensional cavities can be produced within this molecular canvas, enabling the creation of shapes such as letters, a helicoid and a teddy bear. We anticipate that with further optimization of structure design, strand synthesis and assembly procedure even larger structures could be accessible, which could be useful for applications such as positioning functional components.

### Combined petrosal intertentorial approach: a cadaveric study of comparison with the standard combined petrosectomy [^95cede2f]. Operative Neurosurgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Areas of Surgical Exposure

Two areas of exposure (petroclival skull base and brainstem) were calculated by obtaining the sum of areas formed by juxtaposed triangles. For the petroclival area, we identified 4 fixed anatomic landmarks (posterior clinoid process, MC, internal acoustic canal, and jugular foramen) and 2 variables (uppermost and lowest medial clivus). Measuring the coordinates of these 6 points created a hexagonal shape. For the brainstem area, we identified 2 fixed points (trigeminal and facial nerve root entry zone [REZ]) and 3 variables (the lowest medial, the uppermost medial, and uppermost lateral brainstem), obtaining a pentagon-shaped area (Figure 5 A and 5 B drawing). Each polygon was divided along diagonals to create triangles whose area was calculated by the length of each side using Heron's formula. The areas of the 4 triangles of the petroclival skull base and the 3 triangles of the brainstem were then summed to calculate the total area of surgical exposure.

Design of three quasi-independent DNA origami domains. a In presence of magnesium ions, the Holliday junction (HJ) displays two isoforms, characterized by pairwise coaxial stacking of arms into a right-handed antiparallel stacked X-structure, with arms I/IV and III/II stacked in iso I and II/I, IV/III stacked in iso II. The interconversion between the two isomers passes through a less stable open intermediate, where the four helical arms point towards the corners of a square. Global iso I (b) and iso II (c) conformation of the HJs constituting a DNA origami domain and corresponding to the canonical (c) and isomerized (i) shape of the structure. In the iso I isomer the lateral loops are 32 nt- and 22 nt-long, respectively, at the left- and right-side of each domain, whereas 24 nt-long stretches of the unpaired scaffold are located at the top and bottom of each domain (e(−) construct). In the iso II form, instead, every domain adopts an “inverted” configuration, in which the HJs of the core (blue and orange strands) are flanked by lateral stretches and vertical loops of the unpaired scaffold (c). Note the last row of staples on the right-side of each domain (cyan strands): Although forming 32 bp-long duplexes, their secondary structure is partially constrained into a loop by a parallel stretch of unpaired scaffold that is 10 nt shorter. Both the left- and right-side of each domain have been addressed with three types of edges (yellow strands, in the e(0), e(1), and e(2) constructs), differing in the mechanical strain applied at the points of scaffold inversion. Circular symbols indicate the relative orientations of the bases at the helical edges (scaffold and staple bases are in gray and yellow, respectively). The angular displacement from the ideal situation in which the two scaffold bases are aligned and face each other (0°) denotes the degree of torsional stress generated by the hybridization of edge staples

### Arrays of individually controlled ions suitable for two-dimensional quantum simulations [^178267d1]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

A precisely controlled quantum system may reveal a fundamental understanding of another, less accessible system of interest. A universal quantum computer is currently out of reach, but an analogue quantum simulator that makes relevant observables, interactions and states of a quantum model accessible could permit insight into complex dynamics. Several platforms have been suggested and proof-of-principle experiments have been conducted. Here, we operate two-dimensional arrays of three trapped ions in individually controlled harmonic wells forming equilateral triangles with side lengths 40 and 80μm. In our approach, which is scalable to arbitrary two-dimensional lattices, we demonstrate individual control of the electronic and motional degrees of freedom, preparation of a fiducial initial state with ion motion close to the ground state, as well as a tuning of couplings between ions within experimental sequences. Our work paves the way towards a quantum simulator of two-dimensional systems designed at will.

### Overcurvature describes the buckling and folding of rings from curved origami to foldable tents [^3f942d9a]. Nature Communications (2012). Medium credibility.

Creased paper rings are a third example of overcurved structures (Fig. 2c). In curved origami, paper is creased along closed curved paths, resulting in the out-of-plane bending of the folding path due to torsion. Simultaneously, the conservation of arc length by the two sides of the crease imposes an increase of the curvature of the crease by a factor O p =1/cos(δ /2), where δ is the angle between the normals to the two sides of the crease (Supplementary Methods ; Supplementary Figs S2 and S3 ; Supplementary equation S19). We creased a flat circular ring of paper along its median circle, and adjusted the degree of overcurvature by tuning the crease angle δ and holding it constant. After observations, the paper ring was cut and the number of turns in the formed coil was quantified to compute O p. This overcurvation process corresponds to increasing the local pre-set curvature while keeping the length constant.

Finally, to give a human-scale example of overcurved structures, arcs of wood of radius of curvature R =1 m were combined with clamping collars to form closed continuous rings of square cross-section, with different magnitudes of the pre-set overcurvature. Representative images are shown in Fig. 2d and in Supplementary Fig. S4.

The overcurvation scenario is similar for all observed systems: the conformation starts from a circle at O p =1 and buckles to a saddle shape with two pairs of upper and lower lobes for larger pre-set overcurvatures. The opposite lobes of the saddle then overlap close to O p =2.5, and the ring finally debuckles to form a triple-coiled loop for O p =3. All conformations have D 2d symmetry (for creased paper, this holds true only for the crease line). Although some issues are specific to each case, such as the cross-section rotation angle or the formation of wrinkles and lateral creases, the general scenario is identical for these systems, which cover almost five orders of magnitude in spatial scale, and for which the physical origin of overcurving differs sensibly. In the sequel, we concentrate on the general conformation of the centre lines of the rings (or of the crease lines for paper strips), and ignore details such as small wrinkles and lateral creases.

### Shape-assisted self-assembly [^ab0a009c]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

When one associates curvature to shape, three classifications can be envisioned molecularly: zero, positive, and negative curvatures. Flat molecules (zero curvature) are frequently observed in supramolecular polymerizations due to ease of access to these structures synthetically –. Bowl shapes (positive),, and more so saddles (negative),,, are far less commonly used topographies for the opposite reason. Yet, to introduce order in an assembly, negatively curved systems stand out as preferred candidates to induce eclipsed stacking because transverse rigidity is increased on both molecular and macroscopic scales,,. Asymmetry in saddle design, in addition to replacing a uniform surface with a framework scaffold, heightens the entropic barriers further due to unequal axes of principal curvature (Fig. 1). An energetic minimum can then be reached with eclipsing negatively curved frames such that small deviations from overlap demand high energetic penalties and, consequently, enforce order. Depending on the asymmetry of the saddle, their assemblies likely present differentiated lateral interactions permitting the formation of tertiary structures. However, the path towards these molecular topologies is not trivial: seven- or eight-membered rings are often required as the centerpiece of a saddle design but are challenging synthetic constructs to work around,–. Five-membered rings, which would ordinarily foster bowl shapes, can be faced opposite to one another to devise ‘non-classical’ saddles. In the absence of central polygons, this shape can also be achieved through distortions in normally planar architectures due to coordination or steric crowding –. Consideration of these design principles and the available synthetic methodologies convinced us that a contorted porphyrinoid previously reported by Müllencould be tailored to become a versatile platform to explore shape-assisted linear stacking (Fig. 1).

### Closing the gap towards super-long suspension bridges using computational morphogenesis [^0b167599]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Topology optimization

The objective of the optimization is to maximize the stiffness of the center section of the model for a given amount of material, which during optimization is distributed in the interior of the design domain (marked with orange in Supplementary Fig. 1). The problem is solved based on the assumption of static, linear-elastic behavior. The governing partial differential equations (PDEs) are solved using the finite element method, using eight-node hexahedral iso-parametric elements, resulting in the following linear system of equations:Here K (ρ) is the stiffness matrix given as a function of the design variable vector ρ, u is the displacement vector, and F is the load vector. Each mesh element is assigned a single artificial continuous density, ρ e ∈[0, 1], collected in vector ρ, defined in a range from void (0) to solid material (1). The density-based topology optimization method SIMP(Solid Isotropic Material with Penalization) is used, as this enables the use of gradient-based optimization algorithms. The element stiffness is defined by a smooth interpolation between the solid material stiffness, E solid, and a very weak material (E void = 10 −6 E solid), given by the modified SIMP schemeasHere p > 1 is a penalization parameter enforcing almost discrete final designs with ρ e being either 0 or 1, hence, the impractical intermediate densities are penalized and made unfavorable. The stiffness matrix can thus be assembled in the standard way asHereis the element stiffness matrix with unit modulus of elasticity and n is the number of elements in the mesh. Before stating the mathematical optimization problem, the objective function is introduced as compliance (work done by external forces) of only the center section of the model, C = u T F, which is inversely proportional to structural stiffness. Hence, to maximize structural stiffness, the following minimization problem is posed:Here ϕ is the sum of compliances from L load cases, weighted by the scaling factors a i. The first constraint ensures mechanical equilibrium; the second poses a limit on the amount of available material, with V (ρ) being the volume of the current structure and V * the maximum amount of available material and the third defines box constraints on the design variables. To avoid well known, but undesirable effects inherent in topology optimization, such as checkerboards and mesh-dependencies, a filteringof the densities is performed after each optimization iteration. Here, the density filter from ref. an image processing type convolution filter, is applied. Hence, the filter modifies each density as a weighted average of the adjacent densities, given by a filter radius. The filter is thus a method to smoothen the boundaries of the structure. A filter radius of 1.5 times the maximum dimension of a mesh-element is used. Finally, a fully parallelized version of the gradient-based method of moving asymptotes (MMA,) is used as the optimization algorithm.

### Programming molecular topologies from single-stranded nucleic acids [^0bce3824]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Molecular knots represent one of the most extraordinary topological structures in biological polymers. Creating highly knotted nanostructures with well-defined and sophisticated geometries and topologies remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate a general strategy to design and construct highly knotted nucleic acid nanostructures, each weaved from a single-stranded DNA or RNA chain by hierarchical folding in a prescribed order. Sets of DNA and RNA knots of two- or three-dimensional shapes have been designed and constructed (ranging from 1700 to 7500 nucleotides), and they exhibit complex topological features, with high crossing numbers (from 9 up to 57). These single-stranded DNA/RNA knots can be replicated and amplified enzymatically in vitro and in vivo. This work establishes a general platform for constructing nucleic acid nanostructures with complex molecular topologies.

Optimization of the folding pathway for ssDNA knots. a A designed model shows the selected best folding pathway (from one to seven) for the three-square structure with 23 crossings, by following our optimization rules. The red to gray color scale as well as the number one to seven represent the order of the paranemic cohesion interaction strengths on the edges from high to low (one to seven), based on the number and length of the paranemic cohesions involved as shown in b. c The paranemic interaction regions can be designed with lengths of 4 bp or 6 bp with distinct expected binding strengths (6 bp > 4 bp). Therefore, one is able to guide the folding order of the knot structure by controlling the sequences and lengths of the paranemic interactions in each individual edge. We compared the folding efficiency of the known structures by using different folding pathways before and after optimization (d). The AFM images revealed a dramatic increase in the folding yield of well-form structures from 0.9% (N = 221) to 57.9% (N = 214) (e). The scale bars are 200 nm

### Enhanced heterogeneous ice nucleation by special surface geometry [^e45d48b0]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

To answer this question, we examine the spontaneous crystallization trajectory within the 45° wedge, obtained at 230 K. As shown in Fig. 3a, the 45° wedge sees the frequent formation of a uniquely ordered structure at the wedge contact line, preceding the growth of regular ice lattice above it. This ordered structure can be regarded as the lateral repetition of a wedge-shape, non-ice-like building block, as shown in Fig. 3c. The wedge-shape core (WC) is composed of two six-membered rings that are connected by one hydrogen bond (HB) at the top and share two HBs at the bottom. The WC can be derived from the single diamond core (SDC), which is the building block of cubic ice I c (Fig. 3g), through replacing the two HBs on top of SDC by one HB. Therefore, the WC is akin to the crystalline phase of ice, but also involves a small distortion relative to the perfect tetrahedral network. In fact, the WC core has been previously identified as a stable fragment in the topological analysis of HB network in deeply supercooled waterand it is also found to form spontaneously in the 45° wedge when explicitly including HBs by employing an atomistic water model (see Supplementary Note 3).

Because of geometric constraint, the single WC core can only grow in parallel to the wedge contact line, by attaching other WC cores side-by-side. This parallel growth leads to a double WC (Fig. 3d), which provides the growth site for another polyhedral fragment on its top. As shown in Fig. 3e, this polyhedral cage (6 5 5 2) is composed of five 6-membered rings as the prism planes and two 5-membered rings as the basal planes. In particular, the two 6-membered rings at the top of the cage are structurally compatible with the hexagonal core of I h and thus can serve as the anchoring point to grow regular hexagonal layers of ice parallel to graphene planes. As the growth of regular ice layers cannot geometrically fit the 45° wedge, pairs of 5−7 rings emerge to bridge the structure gap. Interestingly, the 5−7 topological defects are found to align themselves regularly, in analogy to a large-angle grain boundary (Fig. 1e).

### Complex multicomponent patterns rendered on a 3D DNA-barrel pegboard [^977fc451]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

DNA origami, in which a long scaffold strand is assembled with a many short staple strands into parallel arrays of double helices, has proven a powerful method for custom nanofabrication. However, currently the design and optimization of custom 3D DNA-origami shapes is a barrier to rapid application to new areas. Here we introduce a modular barrel architecture, and demonstrate hierarchical assembly of a 100 megadalton DNA-origami barrel of ~90nm diameter and ~250nm height, that provides a rhombic-lattice canvas of a thousand pixels each, with pitch of ~8nm, on its inner and outer surfaces. Complex patterns rendered on these surfaces were resolved using up to twelve rounds of Exchange-PAINT super-resolution microscopy. We envision these structures as versatile nanoscale pegboards for applications requiring complex 3D arrangements of matter, which will serve to promote rapid uptake of this technology in diverse fields beyond specialist groups working in DNA nanotechnology.

### A general patterning approach by manipulating the evolution of two-dimensional liquid foams [^7ec00d8c]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

To prepare perfect hexagonal arrays of larger bubbles, increases in the side length of the hexagonal cells result in the increases in the pillar interval, which leads to the formation of defects. An alternative method is to increase the number of silicon pillars on each side (denoted as N) when increase the side length (denoted as l). As shown in Fig. 2c, the pillar interval a equals l /(N −1). For the same side length l, more pillars on each side N correspond to a smaller the pillar interval a, and an increased occurrence of the reverse Ostwald ripening phenomenon. This deduction agrees well with the experiments exhibited in Fig. 2d. The squares on the map mean that N is large and a /2 will be small and less than ρ ; thus, only reverse Ostwald ripening happens, eventually forming perfect hexagonal bubble arrays. The crosses in the map suggest that N is small and a /2 will be much larger than ρ ; thus, only the defect formation will happen. The triangles show that if N is not too large, a /2 will be slightly more than ρ, and some bubbles shows the reverse Ostwald ripening (Fig. 2a) and others exhibits the defect formation (Fig. 2b). The coexistence of reverse Ostwald ripening and defect formation leads to the formation of partly hexagonal bubble arrays (Supplementary Fig. 4b). The least number of silicon pillars on each side and the corresponding maximum pillar interval for preparing perfect bubble arrays of different side length were summarized in Fig. 2e. With the increase of side length, the N min increases significantly for rejecting the increase of pillar interval. Therefore the maximum pillar interval only increases slightly. The allowed maximum pillar interval, a max, can be considered 2 ρ because both are the allowed maximum pillar interval for forming perfect bubble arrays, that is, a /2≤ a max /2≈ ρ.

### Lattice-free prediction of three-dimensional structure of programmed DNA assemblies [^1eed4da7]. Nature Communications (2014). Medium credibility.

DNA can be programmed to self-assemble into high molecular weight 3D assemblies with precise nanometer-scale structural features. Although numerous sequence design strategies exist to realize these assemblies in solution, there is currently no computational framework to predict their 3D structures on the basis of programmed underlying multi-way junction topologies constrained by DNA duplexes. Here, we introduce such an approach and apply it to assemblies designed using the canonical immobile four-way junction. The procedure is used to predict the 3D structure of high molecular weight planar and spherical ring-like origami objects, a tile-based sheet-like ribbon, and a 3D crystalline tensegrity motif, in quantitative agreement with experiments. Our framework provides a new approach to predict programmed nucleic acid 3D structure on the basis of prescribed secondary structure motifs, with possible application to the design of such assemblies for use in biomolecular and materials science.

### Two-dimensional honeycomb network through sequence-controlled self-assembly of oligopeptides [^e37418b5]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Staggered linear arrangements of dimers are occasionally observed at the edges of the islands, indicated for instance in Fig. 3a in the upper right corner. From the model, we see that a polar–nonpolar–polar-binding motif is formed at the ends of the dimer, involving the C-terminal and the Phe8 residue of one peptide, and the Asp1′ residue of the other peptide. This motif promotes the staggered linear arrangements, which offer a binding site to add a third dimer and form the vertex. The Asp1 residue still remains present at the rim of the pore, however the angled arrangement of the two adjacent dimers sterically hinders the approach of another peptide or dimer.

While the threefold symmetry of the vertex might be supported by the substrate symmetry, it is also a direct consequence of the free energy of the system. Coulomb and van-der-Waals interactions have more impact due to the packing of dimers into hexamers. This vertex structure is energetically more favourable for instance over a linear chain arrangement with the same amount of possible hydrogen bonds between the dimers because it is more compact and thus more groups can interact with each other.

Despite the complex and specific binding of the peptides, the honeycomb network demonstrates a high fault tolerance. The position and arrangement of the molecules in the network are clearly revealed by the zero-dimensional defects shown in Fig. 4a. The distance between the two peptides is increased in the dimer that is highlighted by a white rectangle, making the individual molecules distinguishable. This observation confirms the antiparallel arrangement in a double-walled honeycomb network. Furthermore, at the nodes, the binding of three dimers can be askew, marked with white circles in Fig. 4a. This defect directly reveals the chiral, interlocked assembly.

Figure 4b shows a linear grain boundary between two domains that are slightly rotated by approximately 1° against each other. At this angle, the width of the grain boundary increases by 8 Å per hexagonal pore. In the STM images, the appearance of the dimer motif changes along the defect as it is stretched to compensate for the stress. The incorporation of this line defect also requires a rotational variability of the binding at the vertex motif, which is visible in the STM topography.

### Overcurvature describes the buckling and folding of rings from curved origami to foldable tents [^d5f60e74]. Nature Communications (2012). Medium credibility.

Daily-life foldable items, such as popup tents, the curved origami sculptures exhibited in the Museum of Modern Art of New York, overstrained bicycle wheels, released bilayered microrings and strained cyclic macromolecules, are made of rings buckled or folded in tridimensional saddle shapes. Surprisingly, despite their popularity and their technological and artistic importance, the design of such rings remains essentially empirical. Here we study experimentally the tridimensional buckling of rings on folded paper rings, lithographically processed foldable microrings, human-size wood sculptures or closed arcs of Slinky springs. The general shape adopted by these rings can be described by a single continuous parameter, the overcurvature. An analytical model based on the minimization of the energy of overcurved rings reproduces quantitatively their shape and buckling behaviour. The model also provides guidelines on how to efficiently fold rings for the design of space-saving objects.

### Comparison of the effect of W-shaped and linear skin incisions on scar visibility in bilateral external dacryocystorhinostomy [^b2dcc764]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

However, the published paper reports that the scar assessment took place “6 months after each procedure”. See the Materials and methods section paragraph 1 and 3 stating: “The skin incisions were assessed 6 months after each procedure by […]” and “The surgeries were not simultaneous, so assessment of scar visibility on each side was done at the 6-month postoperative visit to prevent one side being more healed than the other at evaluation.”

This last sentence is like a response to one of the reviewer’s comments on the rejected manuscript and explains the motivation of the authors for this change in the published version. Given that both the rejected manuscript and the published paper derived results from the same cohort of patients, a serious question arises with regard to the truthfulness of the method and data in the published paper.

Another potential issue involves a schematic drawing of the WS incision included in the rejected version of the manuscript. This drawing shows that the arms of the WS incision are unequal: the two inner arms toward the nasal dorsum are 8 mm in length (two times longer than the outer arms). However, in the methods section of the text (in the both rejected and published versions), the W shape was described as follows: “The W shape was formed by three consecutive equilateral triangles having sides 4 mm in length with two tips and one base that showed the medial canthus”. Another paper written by these authors, which was previously published in the journal Orbit, also included the similar discrepancy between the drawing and text.This discrepancy becomes unnoticeable when the authors removed the drawing from the published version.

In addition to these discrepancies, another issue I have with this paper is that the idea of a W-shaped incision is presented as original. This idea appeared first in our department in the form of a specialization thesis, in which equal W-shaped and linear incisions were compared.This technique represents a significant advancement in external dacryocystorhinostomy surgery. I have discussed this technique and performed live surgeries at several national meetings in Turkey over the past 8 years. Although Ekinci et al knew about these presentations and the thesis, they presented this method as original research. It is disappointing when fellow academicians adopt such strategies for academic promotion.

### Arrays of individually controlled ions suitable for two-dimensional quantum simulations [^ee7134ad]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Results

Trap arrays and control potentials

Our surface ion trap chip is fabricated in similar manner to that described in ref.and consists of two equilateral triangular trap arrays with side length of ≃40 and ≃80 μm, respectively (Fig. 1a,b), both with a distance of ≃40 μm between the ions and the nearest electrode surface. The shapes of radio-frequency (RF) electrodes of the arrays are optimized by a linear-programming algorithm that yields electrode shapes with low fragmentation, and requires only a single RF-voltage source for operation. To design different and even non-periodic arrays for dedicated trap distances, we can apply the same algorithm to yield globally optimal electrode shapes. Resulting electrode shapes may look significantly different, but will have comparable complexity, spatial extent and the same number of control electrodes per trap site. Therefore, we expect that different arrays will not require different fabrication techniques (Methods). The two arrays are spaced by ≃5 mm on the chip, and only one of them is operated at a given time. Although we achieve similar results in both arrays, the following discussion is focussed on the 80 μm array.

Three-dimensional confinement of 25 Mg + ions is provided by a potential φ RF oscillating at Ω RF from a single RF electrode driven at Ω RF /(2 π)=48.3 MHz with an approximate peak voltage U RF =20 V. Setting the origin of the coordinate system at the centre of the array and in the surface plane of the chip, the RF potential features three distinct trap sites at T0 ≃(−46,0,37) μm,, and. Owing to the electrode symmetry under rotations of ±2 π /3 around the z -axis, it is often sufficient to consider T0 only, as all our findings apply to T1 and T2 after an appropriate rotation. Further, the RF potential exhibits another trap site at ≃(0,0,81) μm (above the centre of the array); this ‘ancillary' trap is used for loading as well as for re-capturing ions that escaped from the other trap sites. We approximate the RF confinement at position r by a pseudopotential, cp. ref. where Q denotes the charge and m the mass of the ion, and E RF (r) is the field amplitude produced by the electrode. Calculations of trapping potentials are based on ref.and utilizing the software package. Equipotential lines of φ ps are shown in Fig. 1c–e.

Consequently, the 2D-edge and vertex detection, as shown in Fig. 4e, g, can be performed by further processing of the obtained orthogonal 1D-edge information. Firstly, based on the linearity of Fourier transform, the edge information on the x - and y -axes can be registered simultaneously by superimposing their corresponding transfer functions in spatial Fourier domain. Hence, 2D-edge detectioncan be achieved by the superposition operation on electric field profiles of Huygens’ metasurface along orthogonal axes, as:

Secondly, by extracting the common parts of x - and y -directions edge data that coexist at the same positions, vertex detectioncan be implemented through the multiplication on 1D-edge detection Huygens’ metasurface profiles along x -axis and y-axis, as:

### Overcurvature describes the buckling and folding of rings from curved origami to foldable tents [^9255f773]. Nature Communications (2012). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The analysis presented here is not complete and relies on two assumptions. The first one is the constancy of curvature over the rings, which we demonstrated for creased paper rings of small strip width. For the other studied systems, it remains an hypothesis, which we validated by experimental observations. Further work should concentrate on delineating its conditions of validity; it is likely to break down for systems of larger cross-section. The second assumption is that each lobe of an overcurved ring is a segment of a Salkowski curve. This hypothesis was also validated by experimental measurements, and proved to be mathematically convenient because it allowed us to provide an analytical approximate solution to a non-trivial buckling problem. However, its experimentally demonstrated validity still lacks a compelling reason. Despite these shortcomings, our solution is already able to represent accurately the general shape of the rings and to connect together a series of systems, as well as relating ring buckling and ring folding.

Interestingly, the mathematical curves used to model overcurved rings form a complete set of curves parameterized by m and O, which might prove useful for solving other problems of physics of D m d symmetry. Furthermore, the geometrical construction used to generate overcurved circles could be generalized to other more complex systems, including foldable systems containing hinges allowing the total twist to be non-zero. Although our approximate solution does not result from solving instability equations, it provides a simple, quantitatively accurate and analytical method for choosing a pre-set overcurvature O p and the cross-sectional dimensions, leading to a desired overcurved conformation. Therefore, it should find widespread usage for a series of scientific problems, such as the folding of plasmid DNA, the self-folding of rings in tridimensional micro-devices or the compaction of deployable items. In addition, it provides rules for designers and origamists for reaching novel complex shapes; finally, and maybe most importantly, it explains to hikers how to fold some popup tents as fast as they can be deployed.

### Metal-peptide rings form highly entangled topologically inequivalent frameworks with the same ring-and crossing-numbers [^730658e2]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

With increasing ring-crossing number (c), knot theory predicts an exponential increase in the number of topologically different links of these interlocking structures, even for structures with the same ring number (n) and c. Here, we report the selective construction of two topologies of 12-crossing peptide [4]catenanes (n=4, c=12) from metal ions and pyridine-appended tripeptide ligands. Two of the 100 possible topologies for this structure are selectively created from related ligands in which only the tripeptide sequence is changed: one catenane has a T 2 -tetrahedral link and the other a three-crossed tetrahedral link. Crystallographic studies illustrate that a conformational difference in only one of the three peptide residues in the ligand causes the change in the structure of the final tetrahedral link. Our results thus reveal that peptide-based folding and assembly can be used for the facile bottom-up construction of 3D molecular objects containing polyhedral links.

### Gradient matters via filament diameter-adjustable 3D printing [^c3c92cbf]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Gradient matters with hierarchical structures endow the natural world with excellent integrity and diversity. Currently, direct ink writing 3D printing is attracting tremendous interest, and has been used to explore the fabrication of 1D and 2D hierarchical structures by adjusting the diameter, spacing, and angle between filaments. However, it is difficult to generate complex 3D gradient matters owing to the inherent limitations of existing methods in terms of available gradient dimension, gradient resolution, and shape fidelity. Here, we report a filament diameter-adjustable 3D printing strategy that enables conventional extrusion 3D printers to produce 1D, 2D, and 3D gradient matters with tunable heterogeneous structures by continuously varying the volume of deposited ink on the printing trajectory. In detail, we develop diameter-programmable filaments by customizing the printing velocity and height. To achieve high shape fidelity, we specially add supporting layers at needed locations. Finally, we showcase multi-disciplinary applications of our strategy in creating horizontal, radial, and axial gradient structures, letter-embedded structures, metastructures, tissue-mimicking scaffolds, flexible electronics, and time-driven devices. By showing the potential of this strategy, we anticipate that it could be easily extended to a variety of filament-based additive manufacturing technologies and facilitate the development of functionally graded structures.

### Compaction of quasi-one-dimensional elastoplastic materials [^46c70653]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Segment size statistics

To better understand the influence of disorder, we choose plastic frictional wires to avoid ordered coils and create the highest possible disorder in the crumpled structure. After compacting the wires, we open the moulds and investigate the resulting compacted structures by analyzing the folding statistics. The points of folding were often determined by sharp changes of wire orientation. If they were not easily distinguishable, then a minimum threshold of 90° for the turning angle of the wire, and a maximum threshold offor the radius of curvature were imposed. We cut the wire at each of the folding points, straighten the segments and measure their length. Straightening of the curved segments rarely allows for segment lengthslonger than the container diameter, but we checked that the maximum segment lengthremains smaller than πR in the absence of coils. We preserve the order of the wire segments and average the results over five realizations for each value of R / r to obtain the sequence of the segment lengths.

A key observation is the scaling of the total number of segments N with the effective system size. Similar scaling laws were reported for 2D packings of wires. As shown in Fig. 2d, a power-law relation of the form

holds with β =1.86±0.03 for smooth wire and container with wire–wire and container-wire friction coefficientsand, respectively. The exponent can be understood by considering the wire crumpling process as a SAW in confinement. For comparison, for the number of steps on a cubic lattice in an ordinary random walk β equals 2, while for SAW(ref.). The fact that we find an exponent in between these two values can be understood because there is a gradual evolution of spatial correlations over the course of crumpling (see below), thus, the exponent continuously decreases from 2. However, the wires can slide over each other due to the finite friction so that the self-avoidance constraint is only partially fulfilled. For comparison, we repeated the experiment by roughening the plastic wires and the inner surface of the moulds to increase the friction coefficients toand. The considerable change in the wire–wire friction resulted in a smaller exponent β =1.75±0.05 which is closer to the pure self-avoidance limit (see Fig. 2d). From the scaling of φ max and N withone expects that the normalized mean segment sizefollows, as confirmed by the experimental results in Fig. 2e.

### Crystalline metamaterials for topological properties at subwavelength scales [^6fb6ddfe]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Experimental demonstration of subwavelength band inversion

Figure 3a,b show pictures of the fabricated samples of topologically trivial and non-trivial metamaterials (see Methods for the sample fabrication). The total size of the samples is comparable with the wavelength in freespace λ 0, pointing out the deep subwavelength nature of the metamaterial crystals. To observe the topological band inversion process, we excite both samples locally in their close vicinity with a homemade antenna (see Methods) and measure the transmitted electric field right above the resonators using a network analyzer. The latter allows us to make a broadband measurement in one step with a high frequency resolution. We carry out a scanning of the full area of the metamaterial. The frequency spectrum of the field amplitude, averaged spatially over a large area corresponding to 6 unit-cells in the center of the bulk, is shown in Fig. 3c (trivial sample) and Fig. 3d (topological sample). As predicted by the band structures of Fig. 2e,f, we observe zero field amplitude in the band gaps, between 4.9 and 5 GHz (shaded area). Outside these frequency regions, peaks in the spectrum traduce efficient coupling between the excitation and a bulk stationary mode. Here we notice the presence of several discrete peaks, in the frequency range corresponding to the continuous band obtained numerically. This discretization of the spectrum comes from the finite size of the sample. In the figure, we therefore include the experimental field maps associated to various frequency peaks, which correspond to different bulk bands in Fig. 2e,f. The insets located at the top right corners of the field maps reproduce the field profile measured over a given hexagon in the sample, allowing the classification of the modes into s, p, d and f types. By allowing for direct mapping of the bulk field distribution, our experiment unambiguously demonstrates the band inversion phenomenon. This, associated with the computed topological invariant, provides a direct confirmation of the distinct topological properties of the two samples. We also note here that the results of the finite-element simulation for the infinite crystals (Fig. 2) are in excellent quantitative agreement with the experimental results, since the modes we measure and compute possess the same symmetries at the same frequencies. The minor deviations between the measured field maps and the computed eigenmodes of the crystal are due to the losses inherent to the metallic wires in the sample, that lead to peak broadening and weak, but noticeable, mode overlapping.

### Distributed spirals: a new class of three-dimensional k-space trajectories [^5f354c75]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

This work presents a new class of three-dimensional spiral based-trajectories for sampling magnetic resonance data. The distributed spirals trajectory efficiently traverses a cylinder or sphere or intermediate shape in k-space. The trajectory is shown to be nearly as efficient as a conventional stack of spirals trajectory in terms of scan time and signal-to-noise ratio, while reducing coherent aliasing in all three spatial directions and reducing Gibbs ringing due to the nature of collecting data from a sphere in k-space. The trajectory uses a single two-dimensional spiral waveform with the addition of a single orthogonal waveform which is scaled with each repetition, making it relatively easy to implement. Blurring from off-resonance only occurs in two dimensions due to the temporal nature of the sampling.

### Revealing nano-scale lattice distortions in implanted material with 3D bragg ptychography [^21962256]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

The structure and size of the probe also have a major impact on the 3D intensity acquisition in BP. To better illustrate this issue, we present the probe used during the experiment (see the cross-section and calculated profile along the beam propagation direction, in Fig. 2b and c). This probe function was characterised prior to our measurement (see Methods). The cross-section presents a rather structured distribution, which includes a central spot of about 400 × 200 nm 2 (intensity FWHM) along the horizontal and vertical planes, respectively and some beam tails and secondary maxima that extend to a much larger area, of about 4 × 4 μm 2. These features must be considered when defining the rocking curve angular steps. Indeed the numerical analysis of the dataset, which is based on the use of the fast Fourier transform, connects reciprocal and direct space through Fourier conjugation relations. Specifically, the sampling angle must be chosen such that the illuminated volume (green line) is fully contained in a cuboid defined in the (r 1, r 2, r 3) reconstruction space (orange line) as shown in Fig. 2a. Depending on the probe structure and on the criterion used to define the probe size, the angular sampling Δ θ required along the rocking curve varies substantially, as illustrated in Fig. 2d, for vertical-plane diffraction geometry. This plot presents the sampling condition as a function of the considered (i.e. vertical) probe width W and the sample thickness T, for a Bragg angle θ B of 43.9° (see Methods and Eq. (2) for further details). For our sample, the required angular sampling varies from a few 0.01° when only the probe central lobe is accounted for, to about 0.001° when the full probe extent is considered (interestingly, this behaviour is only marginally affected by the sample thickness). While 0.001° angular steps are mechanically accessible at Bragg diffraction optimised beamline set-ups, those small steps are still challenging and result in a detrimental linear increase of the total measurement time. To mitigate issues caused by long data collection, a series of compromises are usually made, such as choosing an angular step only accounting for the central lobe sampling condition and/or fewer ptychographic positions and/or smaller angular range, which reduce the field of view and/or degrade the image quality. Furthermore, the structure of the probe secondary maxima that develop far from the central lobe, i.e. corresponding to high frequencies, is more prone to optics instabilities, limiting the use of prior knowledge of the probe for faithful reconstruction. All this underlines the need to retrieve the full probe distribution function and the sample scattering function simultaneously, a strategy we have implemented and applied in this work to produce high-fidelity maps of lattice strains and rotations.

Methods

Study design

The Engineering Better Care (EBC) framework incorporates strands of activity. These are illustrated in the Hexagon Improvement Model (Fig. 1). Agree the Scope, at the centre of the hexagon, underpins six outer activities. The six outer activities begin with Understand the Context followed by Define the Problem and so on in a clockwise direction. As new data are generated by each activity, outputs from previous activities may be refined. Within each activity, specific questions help drive exploration. Figure 1 shows the questions roughly mapped to the activities but this mapping is not definitive. The Improving Improvement Toolkit provides tools and techniques to help answer the questions. The questions are optional and only need to be asked when helpful, hence we chose a subset.

Fig. 1 
The Hexagon Improvement Model.

The hexagon at the centre of the model shows the seven activity strands that are present throughout the Engineering Better Care improvement process. In the early stages, Understand the Context and Define the Problem are given most emphasis and activities continue in a clockwise direction. The Engineering Better Care process also defines questions that are key to the systems approach. The questions are shown in the boxes mapped to the seven activity strands but the mapping need not be definitive.

The current study took place at an early stage in the design process—the development of user requirements—and so focused on the first two activities (Understand the Context and Define the Problem) and on the questions: “Where is the system?” “‘What are the elements?” “‘Who are the stakeholders?” “‘Who will use the system?” “What affects the system?” “What are the needs?” “What does good look like?”

This work was part of a broader mixed methods package of work that received a favourable opinion from the Cambridge Central Research Ethics Committee (REC reference number 17/EE/0136), was granted approval by the Health Research Authority and was registered with the ISRCTN registry (trial ID: ISRCTN20669629, assignment date 20 March 2018, trial start date 1 April 2016).

Four steps were followed to develop the user requirements (Fig. 2).

Introduction

In our daily life, we constantly deal with problems, ranging from the most mundane (e.g. what to cook for dinner given the ingredients at our disposal), to professional activities (e.g. how to reorganize our current plans to meet a new deadline), up to major societal challenges (e.g. how to find innovative solutions against global warming). How do we find new solutions to problems? While the ability to solve problems is a critical skill for adapting to new situations and innovating, the mechanisms underlying the problem-solving process remain largely unknown.

Among the new problems we face each day, some are well-defined (e.g. playing a jigsaw puzzle). The initial state (i.e. the number of independent pieces) and goal state (i.e. assembling the pieces so it looks like the picture model) are clear, and the solver can apply a set of operations (i.e. interlocking the pieces as a function of their shape) to reach the goal. However, for many of our problems (e.g. organizing work activities during the COVID-19 pandemic), the problem space is ambiguous. No heuristics or existing rules could be applied to transform the initial state into the goal state. Such “ill-defined” problemsthus require additional mental processes, which have been tightly linked to creative thinking –. Ill-defined problem-solving (or creative problem-solving) is often referred to as insight solving, where the solution comes to mind suddenly and effortlessly, with a “Eureka” phenomenon –. According to the Representational Change Theory, solving such problems involves restructuring the initial problem mental representational space,, which presumably entails combining elements related to the problem in a new way. In theory, restructuring allows one to change perspective, reframe the problem, or escape its implicitly imposed constraints, leading to creative associations,. For instance, consider the following problem: “A man walks into a bar and asks for a glass of water. The bartender points a shotgun at the man. The man says, ‘Thank you,’ and walks out”. The problem is ill-defined because the path to finding the solution is to be discovered, and the goal state is vague. Solving this problem first requires asking the right question: in which context would a shotgun and a glass of water help somebody? Rather than relying on obvious associations (e.g. a glass of water is related to thirst), solvers must fill the missing link between the relevant elements of the problem (a shotgun induces fear, and fear can be a remedy for hiccups, as can drinking a glass of water). Hence, restructuring the initial representation of a given problem would allow one to see this link and find its solution.

### Hexadecapolar colloids [^90960f96]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Outermost occupied electron shells of chemical elements can have symmetries resembling that of monopoles, dipoles, quadrupoles and octupoles corresponding to filled s-, p-, d- and f-orbitals. Theoretically, elements with hexadecapolar outer shells could also exist, but none of the known elements have filled g-orbitals. On the other hand, the research paradigm of 'colloidal atoms' displays complexity of particle behaviour exceeding that of atomic counterparts, which is driven by DNA functionalization, geometric shape and topology and weak external stimuli. Here we describe elastic hexadecapoles formed by polymer microspheres dispersed in a liquid crystal, a nematic fluid of orientationally ordered molecular rods. Because of conically degenerate boundary conditions, the solid microspheres locally perturb the alignment of the nematic host, inducing hexadecapolar distortions that drive anisotropic colloidal interactions. We uncover physical underpinnings of formation of colloidal elastic hexadecapoles and describe the ensuing bonding inaccessible to elastic dipoles, quadrupoles and other nematic colloids studied previously.

### Coherent movement of error-prone individuals through mechanical coupling [^09e9d878]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Figure 2b–d show the trajectories taken by 1 × 1, 4 × 4 and 7 × 7 Kilobot Soft Robots, respectively, in all trials. It is apparent that the 1 × 1 robot (essentially a single Kilobot with open-loop control) is unable to move in a coherent direction. By contrast, the 7 × 7 robot deviates far less from the reference trajectory. Lacking feedback that is external to the robot, however, the robot will not stay on course indefinitely.

Figure 2e shows the length of the trajectory at the end of the trial as a function of the Kilobot Soft Robot’s size S. For each size, we report on the top the number of failed trials. The mean value (blue solid line) shows that the trajectory length decreases, converging to the optimum value (green dotted line), as the robot size S increases. In other words, the motion of the Kilobot Soft Robot becomes more accurate, the more modules it has.

The performance improvement in terms of accuracy comes at the expense of a reduced average linear speed, as shown in Fig. 2f. Although accuracy tends to improve with robot size S, the speed seems to settle to a constant value of about 0.35 cm/s (successful trials only). Comparing the robot’s speed with that of individual Kilobots (about 1.2 cm/s), we observe that the Kilobot Soft Robot moves at about 29% of the maximum speed of its constituent modules.

Finally, for each trial, we evaluated the extent to which the robots’ shapes were distorted with respect to the reference shape, a square lattice. In the reference shape, all angles formed between adjacent links to neighbouring modules and internal to the robot have the same value of 90°. The root-mean-square distortion is computed as the mean squared error from 90° for all angles. Figure 2g reports the average of the root-mean-square distortion over time. We observe relatively small values of distortion in successful trials (green circles) for robots of any size. Large distortions are observed in the unsuccessful trials (red crosses). The latter indicate that a high proportion of elastic links ended up not being in the correct configuration, which may cause the robot to cease motion.

### Distance makes a difference in crystalline photoluminescence [^78282556]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Crystal structures with double isomerism

The Au 60 S 8 (SCH 2 Ph) 36 (Au 60 S 8 r for short) NCs in the rectangular crystal crystallized in a P1/2c space group, while the Au 60 S 8 (SCH 2 Ph) 36 (Au 60 S 8 n for short) NCs in the needle-like crystal crystallized in a C2/c space group. Both types of crystals have two pairs of chiral Au 60 S 8 (SCH 2 Ph) 36 NCs in the unit cell, as shown in Supplementary Fig. 4. The anatomy of structures demonstrates that both Au 60 S 8 r and Au 60 S 8 n are composed of an Au 14 kernel protected by a pair of Au 23 S 4 (SCH 2 Ph) 18 staples (Fig. 1). The Au 14 kernel can be viewed as two bi-tetrahedral Au 8 units with an fcc -based antiprismatic shape sharing two gold atoms (Fig. 1a, e), and the Au 23 S 4 (SCH 2 Ph) 18 staple can convert to the other one by rotating 180° along the C 2 symmetry axis (Fig. 1b, c, f, g). Therefore, Au 60 S 8 r and Au 60 S 8 n NCs have no obvious differences in the framework structure, which is also supported by their negligible bond length and angle differences in the shells of Au 60 S 8 r and Au 60 S 8 n NCs (e.g. average Au-S bond: 2.306 vs. 2.310 Å; average S–Au–S bond angle: 172.8° vs. 172.6°, respectively). To clarify this, a pair of enantiomers are extracted from the Au 60 S 8 r (Fig. 2a, b) and Au 60 S 8 n (Fig. 2c, d) crystals. As shown in Fig. 2a, c, b, d, although there are no detectable differences in their framework structures, the assembly patterns of phenylmethanethiolate on the NC surfaces are obviously different. In other words, the surface ligands on the two NCs have different conformations. Therefore, Au 60 S 8 r and Au 60 S 8 n NCs are conformational isomers (conformer). As mentioned above, Au 60 S 8 r and Au 60 S 8 n NCs are racemic mixtures, and the chirality originates not only from the arrangement of phenylmethanethiolate (Fig. 2a, b, c, d) but also from the packing of both the Au 23 S 4 (SCH 2 Ph) 18 staples and Au 14 kernel (Supplementary Fig. 5, Au 60 S 8 r as an example). For an illustration of double isomerism, see Fig. 2a–c. Such a double isomerism phenomenon was not previously reported in nanochemistry to the best of our knowledge. The phenylmethanethiolates nonuniformly distribute on the NC surface (Fig. 3a, b, d, e): 18 of them distribute in the middle section of the NC, which appears to be the torso of a millipede, and the left 18 phenylmethanethiolates dispersedly distribute on both sides similar to the feet of the millipede (Fig. 3c, f). Obviously, the phenylmethanethiolate ligands (highlighted by white ellipses in Fig. 3a, d, b, e) on the Au 60 S 8 r and Au 60 S 8 n surfaces have different stereochemical structures or occupied sites (also see Supplementary Figs. 6, 7). There are various possible intraparticle C–H···π interactions since the distance between the C-H and the closest benzene ring ranges from 2.58 to 2.98 Å (averaged: 2.78 ± 0.20 Å) in Au 60 S 8 r and from 2.61 to 2.85 Å (averaged: 2.73 ± 0.12 Å) in Au 60 S 8 n,. Moreover, the so-called C–H···π interactions in Au 60 S 8 r are randomly distributed, which is obviously different from those in Au 60 S 8 n with approximate plane symmetrical structures of the phenylmethanethiolate assembly (see Fig. 3g, h).

### Comparison of the effect of W-shaped and linear skin incisions on scar visibility in bilateral external dacryocystorhinostomy [^d031900f]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Surgical procedure

All patients were operated on using the same surgical protocol. The LS incision was 12 mm in length and 8 mm medial to the medial canthus, with one third of the incision (4 mm) lying above the medial canthal angle(Figure 1A). The WS skin incision was 12 mm in linear length. The W shape was formed by three consecutive equilateral triangles having sides 4 mm in length with two tips and one base that showed the medial canthus (Figure 1B). Except for the difference in shape of the skin incision, the surgical dissection technique was the same in all patients. The orbicularis muscle was dissected. After reaching the periosteum, the anterior lacrimal crest was exposed, with elevation of the periosteum. The lacrimal sac was inflated with irrigation and its borders were defined. It was pushed laterally with a periosteal elevator, and the osteotomy was performed and expanded with rongeur. H-shaped flaps were prepared on the lacrimal sac and nasal mucosa. The anterior and posterior flaps were sutured with two separate 6/0 Vicryl sutures, creating an anastomosis between the lacrimal sac and the nasal cavity. The subcutaneous tissues were sutured with three 6/0 Vicryl sutures, and the skin incisions were sutured with 6/0 Prolene. The LS incisions were closed using four separate sutures and the WS incisions with five separate sutures placed at the tips and gaps of the triangles that had been formed by the incisions. There were no perioperative problems (such as excessive bleeding as a result of angular vessel damage, injury of the posterior part of the medial canthal tendon, or injury of the lateral nasal wall) or postoperative complications in either group.

### Chiral 3D structures through multi-dimensional transfer printing of multilayer quantum dot patterns [^ee5a97d3]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Three-dimensional optical nanostructures have garnered significant interest in photonics due to their extraordinary capabilities to manipulate the amplitude, phase, and polarization states of light. However, achieving complex three-dimensional optical nanostructures with bottom-up fabrication has remained challenging, despite its nanoscale precision and cost-effectiveness, mainly due to inherent limitations in structural controllability. Here, we report the optical characteristics of intricate two- and three-dimensional nanoarchitectures made of colloidal quantum dots fabricated with multi-dimensional transfer printing. Our customizable fabrication platform, directed by tailored interface polarity, enables flexible geometric control over a variety of one-, two-, and three-dimensional quantum dot architectures, achieving tunable and advanced optical features. For example, we demonstrate a two-dimensional quantum dot nanomesh with tuned subwavelength square perforations designed by finite-difference time-domain calculations, achieving an 8-fold enhanced photoluminescence due to the maximized optical resonance. Furthermore, a three-dimensional quantum dot chiral structure is also created via asymmetric stacking of one-dimensional quantum dot layers, realizing a pronounced circular dichroism intensity exceeding 20°.
