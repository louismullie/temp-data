## Question

What are the congenital conditions dependent on a patent ductus arteriosus?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which congenital heart conditions are dependent on a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) for survival. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "ductal-dependent" means physiologically. Then, I should verify which lesions require ductal patency for pulmonary blood flow versus those that require it for systemic perfusion. Next, I will enumerate the specific diagnoses commonly cited in guidelines and reviews. After that, I should double-check nuances such as mixed physiology and the role of prostaglandin therapy. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, clinically useful categorization and confirm it against authoritative sources before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the definition so I don't misclassify conditions. "Ductal-dependent" refers to congenital cardiac lesions in which survival after birth depends on continued patency of the ductus arteriosus to provide either pulmonary blood flow or systemic perfusion until definitive palliation or repair can be achieved, which is why prostaglandin E1 (alprostadil) is used to maintain ductal patency in these infants [^113CXdK6] [^112Von2H] [^1151q6JJ].

> I will now examine the two major physiologic categories. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — some sources blur the distinction, so I should be precise. Ductal-dependent pulmonary blood flow describes lesions where the right ventricular outflow or pulmonary arteries are obstructed, so the ductus must supply pulmonary perfusion; ductal-dependent systemic blood flow describes lesions where the left-sided outflow is obstructed, so the ductus must retrogradely perfuse the systemic circulation, typically via right-to-left shunting from the pulmonary artery to the descending aorta [^1151q6JJ] [^113CXdK6].

> Next, I should review concrete examples of ductal-dependent pulmonary blood flow. Let me think about the canonical lesions: pulmonary atresia (with intact ventricular septum or with VSD), critical pulmonary stenosis, tetralogy of Fallot with severe right ventricular outflow obstruction, and tricuspid atresia; in all of these, pulmonary perfusion relies on the ductus until surgical or catheter-based palliation establishes a stable source of pulmonary blood flow, which is why prostaglandin is started emergently when suspected [^113CXdK6] [^112Von2H] [^1151q6JJ].

> Now, I should review ductal-dependent systemic blood flow. Hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) is the prototypical example, where the left-sided structures are underdeveloped and the systemic circulation depends on right-to-left ductal flow; other left-sided obstructive lesions such as interrupted aortic arch and critical coarctation of the aorta similarly require ductal patency to perfuse the lower body until the arch is repaired or reconstructed, so prostaglandin is life-saving in these scenarios as well [^115B1kx2] [^113CXdK6] [^112Von2H] [^1151q6JJ].

> Wait, let me verify a potential pitfall: transposition of the great arteries (d-TGA). Initially, I almost listed d-TGA as ductal-dependent systemic flow, but that would be imprecise; in d-TGA, mixing between parallel systemic and pulmonary circuits is essential for survival, and mixing occurs via an ASD, VSD, or PDA, so the ductus can be one of the mixing pathways, but the condition is not purely "ductal-dependent systemic flow" in the same sense as HLHS or interrupted arch. I should correct that and frame d-TGA as a mixing lesion in which a PDA may contribute to mixing and oxygenation until an atrial septostomy or arterial switch is performed, rather than a lesion that mandates ductal flow for systemic perfusion per se [^1145vc6T] [^113CXdK6] [^112Von2H].

> I need to ensure I'm not overstating the role of the ductus in all cyanotic lesions. Let me reconsider: some cyanotic lesions have adequate pulmonary blood flow without the ductus, whereas others are truly ductal-dependent; the key discriminator is whether pulmonary or systemic outflow is critically obstructed such that ductal patency is required to sustain adequate perfusion until staged repair, which is why timely prostaglandin initiation is standard of care when ductal dependence is suspected [^112Von2H] [^113CXdK6] [^1151q6JJ].

> Next, I should review epidemiology and detection implications to contextualize risk. About 1–1.8 per 1000 live births have a duct-dependent circulation, and many such infants are discharged undiagnosed; pulse oximetry screening improves detection of critical CHD including duct-dependent lesions, underscoring the importance of early recognition and prostaglandin therapy to prevent circulatory collapse after ductal constriction [^1174cHpM] [^112Von2H].

> Let me synthesize a clinically usable categorization, and I will double-check it against the FDA label and contemporary reviews before finalizing. Ductal-dependent pulmonary blood flow includes pulmonary atresia, critical pulmonary stenosis, tetralogy of Fallot with severe right ventricular outflow obstruction, and tricuspid atresia; ductal-dependent systemic blood flow includes hypoplastic left heart syndrome, interrupted aortic arch, and critical coarctation of the aorta; transposition of the great arteries represents a mixing lesion wherein a PDA may facilitate mixing but is not strictly a ductal-dependent systemic perfusion lesion in the same mechanistic sense, though prostaglandin may still be used to augment mixing when other pathways are limited [^113CXdK6] [^112Von2H] [^1151q6JJ] [^1145vc6T].

> Finally, I should confirm the therapeutic implication so the clinical message is clear. In any infant suspected of a duct-dependent lesion, initiate prostaglandin E1 promptly to maintain ductal patency, arrange urgent transfer to a pediatric cardiac center, and proceed to definitive palliation or repair in a timely fashion; delays risk circulatory collapse and death, which is why early recognition and prostaglandin therapy are foundational in the management of these conditions [^113CXdK6] [^112Von2H] [^1151q6JJ].

Congenital heart diseases that depend on a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) for survival are those in which the ductus is required to maintain either **pulmonary or systemic blood flow** [^1151q6JJ]. These are termed **ductal-dependent lesions** and include:

- **Pulmonary atresia**: Pulmonary valve or artery is blocked; the PDA supplies pulmonary blood flow [^113CXdK6].
- **Tetralogy of Fallot with severe pulmonary stenosis**: The PDA provides critical pulmonary blood flow when right ventricular outflow is severely obstructed [^113CXdK6].
- **Tricuspid atresia**: Absent tricuspid valve; the PDA is needed for pulmonary perfusion [^113CXdK6].
- **Hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS)**: The PDA sustains systemic perfusion by shunting right ventricular output to the aorta [^115B1kx2].
- **Interrupted aortic arch**: The PDA bridges the interrupted segment to maintain distal systemic flow [^113CXdK6].
- **Critical coarctation of the aorta**: The PDA preserves lower-body perfusion when the aortic narrowing is severe [^113CXdK6].
- **Transposition of the great arteries (TGA)**: The PDA enables mixing of systemic and pulmonary circulations until septostomy or surgery [^1145vc6T].

In these conditions, **prostaglandin E1 is used to keep the ductus open** until definitive repair or palliation is possible [^113zu384] [^113CXdK6].

### Patent ductus arteriosus: to treat or not to treat? [^113wWU65]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2012). Low credibility.

Persistent patency of the ductus arteriosus in the preterm infant is associated with numerous morbidities, including higher rates of bronchopulmonary dysplasia and increased mortality. These strong associations have led to widespread use of cyclooxygenase inhibitors and surgical ligation to achieve ductal closure in the expectation that closing the ductus will reduce these complications. Each of these interventions has its own associated adverse effects. Neither individual randomised controlled trials nor meta-analyses of those trials have been able to demonstrate long-term benefits of these treatments despite their efficacy in inducing ductal closure and reducing the need for ductal ligation. Despite the potential shortcomings of those trials, they provide substantial cumulative evidence that early, routine treatment to close a persistently patent ductus arteriosus in preterm infants does not improve outcomes and should therefore be abandoned. Future trials of these interventions for patent ductus management should address different questions. Persistence of ductal patency should be considered a sign of rather than a direct cause of the several morbidities with which it is clearly associated. Practitioners should tolerate ductal patency and learn to manage its causes and consequences rather than focusing on achievement of ductal closure.

Despite a large body of scientific evidence on the management of premature infants with a patent ductus arteriosus controversy remains and neonatologists remain challenged for knowing which patient to treat, what is the most optimal timing of treatment and which treatments have a positive impact on both short-term and long-term outcomes. In this review article we discuss the increased body of evidence over the past 10years, much of which questions the role of treatment and suggests the need to reconsider how haemodynamic significance is adjudicated. In addition, we discuss novel approaches to assessment and diagnosis, and highlight areas for future investigation.

### Patent ductus arteriosus: a contemporary perspective for the pediatric and adult cardiac care provider [^115wen3y]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

The ductus arteriosus (DA) is a vascular structure that bridges the 2 major arteries leading from the heart, connecting the proximal descending aorta to the pulmonary artery near the origin of the left branch pulmonary artery. The DA is an essential component of fetal circulation, diverting cardiac output away from the lungs toward the placenta to support systemic oxygenation. At birth, the placental circulation is clamped and removed, resistance in the pulmonary vascular bed decreases, and the lungs become the source of oxygenation and gas exchange; thus, the DA is no longer necessary. In normal term infants, the DA closes in > 90% by 48 hours and in 100% by 96 hours of age. In preterm infants, structural and physiological immaturity of the ductus is associated with later closure of the DA and increasing the probability that the DA will remain patent at the equivalent of term gestation. For example, among infants born at < 26 weeks' gestation, the median age at spontaneous DA closure is 66 days, and at term equivalent age the DA remains patent in > 25%, referred to as a patent DA (PDA). In a few individuals, a PDA will remain open into later childhood or adult life.

The clinical consequences of a PDA are dependent on its size and the cardiopulmonary status of the patient. Although fundamental questions on best treatment practices for the PDA remain unanswered, the present review is intended to provide pediatric and adult cardiac care providers with a contemporary framework to support the practice of evidence‐based medicine. In view of marked differences in preterm infants and more mature, term counterparts (viewed on a continuum with term infants beyond the first months of life, older children, and adult patients), the mechanisms regulating ductal patency, genetic contributions, clinical consequences, and diagnostic and treatment approaches are discussed separately, when appropriate.

PDA

Cardiac congenital anomalies affect 1% of live births or 40,000 babies annually in the United States and are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality associated with congenital defects. Particularly common is PDA, found in 0.3–0.8% of term infants. 1 In contrast with other cardiac anomalies, PDA is the only known congenital condition in which pharmacotherapy may successfully salvage underlying disease. However, therapeutic protocols vary among healthcare providers. A call for action to optimize therapeutic regimens and address the significant portion of nonresponders to existing management options has been issued, prompted by a recent systematic analysis of 4,800 infants with PDA. 2 Accordingly, the present perspective summarizes PDA pathobiology–informed advances that aim to enhance the success rate in potentially responsive preterm infants and to seek alternatives for cohorts not responding to current strategies.

Ductus arteriosus (or "ductus Botalli") is a vital fetal conduit enabling intrauterine life by directly connecting the pulmonary with the systemic circulation to bypass nonfunctioning lungs (Figure 1). With the first breath at birth and the establishment of functioning lungs, the ductus becomes obsolete and spontaneously closes before converting into a fibrotic remnant ("ligamentum arteriosus"). Persistent ductus patency, i.e. PDA, provokes pathological shunting predisposing to cardiopulmonary complications and systemic adversity. Timely treatment protects the heart from decompensation and contributes to longitudinal physical fitness and social wellness. Failure to complete normal development in utero typically relegates traditional congenital cardiac defects to anatomical correction of an already‐florid disease state. Conversely, the remnant destiny of PDA, i.e. the failure to withdraw from a fetal structure, offers the unique opportunity to rescue a still‐nascent culprit pathway at the point of diagnosis.

### Diagnosis and management of patent ductus arteriosus [^111neKBt]. NeoReviews (2018). Low credibility.

Preterm infants are at increased risk for patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). Prolonged exposure to PDA may be deleterious and has been associated with neonatal morbidity and mortality. Although the molecular mechanisms underlying regulation of postnatal ductus arteriosus closure are not fully understood, clinical experience and research trials have informed recent changes in PDA management strategies and refocused treatment strategies on smaller subsets of infants who require intervention. This review examines current diagnostic and management approaches to PDA in preterm neonates.

Introduction

It is well-established that a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) does not embody one static entity that leads to a specific set of well-defined consequences but rather gives rise to a spectrum of haemodynamic and clinical sequelae. Persistence of the ductus arteriosus is associated with adverse outcomes, including bronchopulmonary dysplasia, necrotising enterocolitis (NEC), cerebral injury and mortality. However, cause-and-effect relationships have not yet been definitively established.

The definition of a haemodynamically significant PDA remains non-standardised and lacks consensus across clinical sites. In assessing the haemodynamic impact of the PDA, many studies have focused on 'clinical significance' or ductal diameter alone, rather than accounting for the broader physiological consequences. This approach has led to an erroneous assumption that neonates with PDAs of potentially very different haemodynamic significance can be clustered into a single, homogenous group for research purposes. This inconsistency and cohort variability has impaired accurate interpretation of clinical trial outcomes and the subsequent synthesis of evidence-based management plans. The high level of open-label treatment in clinical trials further undermines findings. Finally, the lack of clinician equipoise surrounding the treatment of a PDA in preterm neonates, makes well-designed randomised control trials (RCTs) involving a non-risk stratified non-treatment arm neither ethical nor feasible in the current era.

### Path toward proactive therapy for patent ductus arteriosus [^113wWeCb]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2019). Medium credibility.

Management of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in newborns is challenging. Options are in particular restricted by risk–benefit considerations. Severe forms of ductus malfunction, causing circulatory failure, require heart surgery or vascular intervention to correct the structural defect. Development of lower‐risk alternatives is warranted. Deconvolution of underlying pathobiology would inform proactive promotion of innate ductus closure with the prospect of identifying druggable targets that address a current unmet need in vulnerable populations.

### From galen to gross and beyond: a brief history of the enigmatic patent ductus arteriosus [^114sqvzh]. Journal of Perinatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Anatomists since antiquity and pathologists since at least the 17th century had identified the ductus arteriosus (DA) in cadavers and postmortem examinations, respectively. However, healthcare providers for more than a century have struggled to understand the significance of a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in patients, debated whether to treat it or not and if so, when and how. Accepted answers depended upon the authoritative position of the person(s) offering recommendations, the cumulative contemporary medical knowledge, and the changing patient population characteristics. The treatment choices were most often based on one's understanding of the balance between the risks and benefits of the chosen treatment. In the current era, with the increasing popularity of transcatheter occlusion of the PDA with relative ease even in extremely premature infants whose survival rates have improved dramatically, a basic question has reemerged-what are the benefits to treating the PDA in any preterm infant. In this brief review, I am providing a chronicle of the evolution of knowledge about the DA, the varying nature of the challenges a patent ductus posed for the caregivers, and the roots of the continued debate concerning the management of the enigmatic PDA.

This article reviews the physiology of the ductus arteriosus, the pathophysiology of the patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), and the role advanced imaging such as computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can play in guiding diagnosis and percutaneous or surgical intervention. A PDA can have variable clinical and radiologic presentations and can be important to characterize in patients with vascular rings, aortic maldevelopment and congenital heart disease. An understanding of the PDA and the application of CT and MRI can allow the radiologist to provide key information to physicians who plan to close a PDA or maintain PDA patency in the setting of ductal-dependent congenital heart disease.

### Patent ductus arteriosus: are current neonatal treatment options better or worse than no treatment at all? [^1128iNfc]. Seminars in Perinatology (2012). Low credibility.

Although a moderate-sized patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) needs to be closed by the time a child is 1–2 years old, there is great uncertainty about whether it needs to be closed during the neonatal period. Although 95% of neonatologists believe that a moderate-sized PDA should be closed if it persists in infants (born before 28 weeks) who still require mechanical ventilation, the number of neonatologists who treat a PDA when it occurs in infants who do not require mechanical ventilation varies widely. Both the high likelihood of spontaneous ductus closure and the absence of randomized controlled trials, specifically addressing the risks and benefits of neonatal ductus closure, add to the current uncertainty. New information suggests that early pharmacologic treatment has several important short-term benefits for the preterm newborn. By contrast, ductus ligation, while eliminating the detrimental effects of a PDA on lung development, may create its own set of morbidities that counteract many of the benefits derived from ductus closure.

Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) — clinical context and prevalence: PDA is found in about 0.3% to 0.8% of term infants and is twice as common in females as males. The clinical and physiological manifestations of the PDA are dependent on the size of the vessel and the relative systemic and pulmonary vascular resistances, and lesions can range from hemodynamically insignificant to large enough without intervention to cause congestive HF and pulmonary hypertension. Many PDAs are now closed in infancy or childhood with catheter-based or surgical approaches; in adults, consideration of catheter-based or surgical intervention depends on symptoms and physiological expression, and follow-up is important for all although timing and testing vary among individuals.

### Use of prostaglandins in duct-dependent congenital heart conditions [^112Von2H]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2018). Low credibility.

Congenital heart disease (CHD) remains a leading cause of infant mortality, which is even higher in infants with undiagnosed duct-dependent CHDs. Up to 39%-50% of infants with critical CHD are being discharged undiagnosed from the hospital. Infants with duct-dependent critical CHD remain well during the fetal period and may deteriorate when the ductus arteriosus (commonly called 'duct') closes after birth. It is critical to open or maintain ductus arteriosus patent in infants with duct-dependent CHDs. Prostaglandin E1 (alprostadil marketed as 'Prostin VR ') and prostaglandin E2 (dinoprostone) are used to maintain a patent ductus arteriosus and the dose of medication depends on the clinical presentation. Delay in starting prostaglandin infusion can have deleterious effects on infants and can even lead to death. These infants often present as an emergency, and professionals caring for these infants need to have a good understanding of these conditions and medications used for ductal patency.

### The ductus arteriosus in neonates with critical congenital heart disease [^1151q6JJ]. Journal of Perinatology (2022). Medium credibility.

The ductus arteriosus (DA) has a paradoxical biological role in neonates with congenital heart disease (CHD) and can present with significant management challenges. Critical congenital cardiac lesions rely on the patency of the DA to provide either systemic or pulmonary blood flow. A patent DA (PDA) that remains open can also have adverse consequences depending on the degree of systemic to-pulmonary shunting and volume of ductal steal. As such, the presence of a PDA may pose a challenge in the medical management and timing of surgical repair. In this perspective article, we provide an understanding of the role of the DA in the circulatory system in neonates with CHD and discuss traditional and emerging approaches to support the pulmonary and systemic circulations with manipulation of the DA.

### The patent ductus arteriosus in term infants, children, and adults [^116xa2eD]. Seminars in Perinatology (2012). Low credibility.

During fetal life, the ductus arteriosus is a normal and essential structure that connects the pulmonary artery to the distal aortic arch, permitting right ventricular ejection into the aorta. After birth, with commencement of pulmonary blood flow and a 2-ventricle circulation, a variety of physiological and biochemical signals normally result in complete closure of the ductus. Persistent patency of the ductus arteriosus may impair systemic cardiac output and result in deleterious effects on the cardiovascular system and lungs. Although surgery is still the treatment of choice for most premature infants with patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), transcatheter techniques have largely supplanted surgery for closure of PDA in children and adults. This article is a review of the PDA in term infants, children, and adults, with focus on the clinical manifestations and management.

### Patent ductus arteriosus: lack of evidence for common treatments [^1171jNZV]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2007). Low credibility.

Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is a common diagnosis among extremely premature infants, especially in those with lung disease. Treatments are often used to close the PDA. Despite nearly three decades of research, the question of whether the benefits of treatments to prevent ductal patency or promote closure outweigh the risks of these treatments remains unanswered. The authors rarely use treatments designed to close the PDA. This article reviews three considerations in support of this restrained approach: rates of spontaneous closure of the ductus arteriosus; adverse effect of persistent ductal patency; and benefits and risks of treatments for closure.

Congenital heart disease in adults is a rapidly growing field, with many operated and unoperated infants and children surviving into adulthood. Patent ductus arteriosus is an example of a congenital cardiac defect, which may enable patients to survive well into adulthood without prior recognition or correction before symptoms arise. This case illustrates the clinical and echocardiographic manifestations of patent ductus arteriosus with special emphasis on its 2-dimensional and Doppler findings. Management options for this condition are also briefly addressed.

Patent ductus arteriosus — epidemiology and clinical features note that PDA is found in about 0.3% to 0.8% of term infants and is twice as common in females as males, that lesion severity ranges from a small hemodynamically insignificant lesion to one that without intervention is large enough to cause congestive heart failure (HF) and pulmonary hypertension, and that many PDAs are now closed in infancy or childhood with catheter-based or surgical approaches; for ducts remaining patent in adulthood, intervention consideration depends on symptoms and physiological expression, and follow-up as adults is important although timing and testing vary.

Pharmacological and/or surgical closure of a hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in the very preterm infant has been the standard of care over the past few decades. However, the rationale for closure of PDA has recently been challenged. In this article, the factors that have fueled the controversy of the approach to the management of PDA and the gap in our knowledge are reviewed in detail. In addition, the pros and cons of the different treatment strategies applied in clinical care are evaluated with a focus on discussing the available evidence in the literature.

### Managing the patent ductus arteriosus: current treatment options [^117Cmc5h]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2014). Low credibility.

Optimal management of the patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in the premature infant remains controversial. Despite considerable historical and physiological data indicating that a persistent PDA may be harmful, robust evidence of long-term benefits or harms from treatment is lacking. This has been equated to a lack of benefit but is also a reflection of the fact that most clinical trials were designed to assess the effects of short-term (2–8days) rather than prolonged exposure to a PDA. No clinical trials have been designed to assess the effects of prolonged exposure of persistent PDA on morbidity and mortality of very premature infants in the era of antenatal corticosteroids, surfactant and non-invasive respiratory support. Further research is required, but new insights and novel therapies are evolving, which will allow greater individual patient assessment, understanding of risk and optimisation of treatment. In this paper, we review the current literature, evidence for treatment options, including a non-interventional approach, and research directions for infants < 28weeks' gestational age.

### Prostaglandin E1 for maintaining ductal patency in neonates with ductal-dependent cardiac lesions [^113zu384]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) is used to keep the ductus arteriosus patent and can be life-saving in neonates with ductal-dependent cardiac lesions. PGE1 is used to promote mixing of pulmonary and systemic blood flow or improve pulmonary or systemic circulations, prior to balloon atrial septostomy or surgery. PGE1 therapy may cause several short-term and long-term adverse effects. The efficacy and safety of PGE1 in neonates with ductal-dependent cardiac lesions has not been systematically reviewed.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy and safety of both short-term (< 120 hours) and long-term (≥ 120 hours) PGE1 therapy in maintaining patency of the ductus arteriosus and decreasing mortality in ductal-dependent cardiac lesions.

Search Methods

We searched the literature in October 2017, using the search strategy recommended by Cochrane Neonatal. We searched electronic databases (CENTRAL (in the Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, CINAHL, Embase); abstracts of the Pediatric Academic Societies; websites for registered trials at www.clinicaltrials.gov and www.controlled-trials.com; and in the reference list of identified articles.

Selection Criteria

Randomized or quasi-randomized trials using PGE1 at any dose or duration to maintain ductal patency in term or late preterm (≥ 34 weeks' gestation) infants with ductal-dependent cardiac lesions and which reported effectiveness and safety in the short term or long term.

Data Collection and Analysis

We followed the standard Cochrane methods for conducting a systematic review. Two review authors (SA and MP) independently assessed the titles and abstracts of studies identified by the search strategy to determine eligibility for inclusion. We obtained the full-text version if eligibility could not be done reliably by title and abstract. We resolved any differences by discussion. We designed electronic forms for trial inclusion/exclusion, data extraction, and for requesting additional published information from authors of the original reports.

Main Results

Our search did not identify any completed or ongoing trials that met our inclusion criteria.

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence from randomized controlled trials to determine the safety and efficacy of PGE1 in neonates with ductal-dependent cardiac lesions. Evidence from observational trials have informed clinical practice on the use of PGE, which is now considered the standard of care for ductal-dependent cardiac lesions. It is unlikely that randomized controlled studies will be performed for this indication but comparative efficacy of newer formulations of PGE1, different doses of PGE1 and studies comparing PGE with PDA stents or other measures to keep the ductus open may be ethical and necessary.

Outlook

In conclusion, PDA is a common cardiac anomaly with newly acquired knowledge expanding the understanding of underlying disease mechanisms. The ensuing development of proactive therapeutic approaches that target identified pathways, specific to the diseased neonatal organ system, would benefit vulnerable populations with PDA, in particular those in whom current pharmacological options are ineffective or contraindicated. Science‐informed therapy at birth is at the vanguard of next‐generation solutions in childcare. This evolving landscape heralds an evolution in pediatric clinical pharmacology that integrates the young patient within a causative care regimen.

### Genetics of patent ductus arteriosus susceptibility and treatment [^116MuVos]. Seminars in Perinatology (2012). Low credibility.

The ductus arteriosus is a vital fetal structure designed to close shortly after birth. Although many physiologic and pharmacologic investigations have characterized the closure of this structure, genetic studies of persistent patency of the ductus arteriosus (patent ductus arteriosus, PDA) are relatively recent. Progress in the identification of specific genes associated with PDA is well behind that of many adult-onset diseases because of several reasons ranging from the lack of large biorepositories for this unique population to the belief that any genetic contribution to PDA is minimal. Viewing the PDA as a complex, developmentally influenced disease with both genetic and environmental risk factors has resulted in initial successes in some genetic studies. We will introduce several genetic approaches, which have been or are currently being applied to the study of PDA, that have been successful in identifying polymorphisms associated with adult diseases. Genetic investigations of PDA will be discussed with respect to heritability, in general, and to specific risk genes. Several animal models that have been used to study PDA-related genes will also be presented. Further advances in discovering genetic variation causing PDA will drive the more rational use of current therapies, and may help identify currently unknown targets for future therapeutic manipulation.

### Patent ductus arteriosus and short-and long-term respiratory outcomes [^114Ec75Q]. American Journal of Perinatology (2016). Low credibility.

The patency of the ductus arteriosus is very common in extremely premature infants. The increased pulmonary blood flow that results from left-to-right ductal shunting can produce an acute deterioration in lung function and some data suggest that it may increase the risk of chronic lung damage. However, there is no clear evidence that prophylactic or early closure of the patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) results in a clear reduction in bronchopulmonary dysplasia. For this reason, and because of the side effects of the available therapies to close the ductus, there is a wide variation in the approach to the PDA in this population and most clinicians will intervene to close the ductus only in cases of significant shunt with hemodynamic decompensation.

### Patent ductus arteriosus: a contemporary perspective for the pediatric and adult cardiac care provider [^116SShhr]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

The burden of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) continues to be significant. In view of marked differences in preterm infants versus more mature, term counterparts (viewed on a continuum with adolescent and adult patients), mechanisms regulating ductal patency, genetic contributions, clinical consequences, and diagnostic and treatment thresholds are discussed separately, when appropriate. Among both preterm infants and older children and adults, a range of hemodynamic profiles highlighting the markedly variable consequences of the PDA are provided. In most contemporary settings, transcatheter closure is preferable over surgical ligation, but data on longer-term outcomes, particularly among preterm infants, are lacking. The present review provides recommendations to identify gaps in PDA diagnosis, management, and treatment on which subsequent research can be developed. Ultimately, the combination of refined diagnostic thresholds and expanded treatment options provides the best opportunities to address the burden of PDA. Although fundamental gaps remain unanswered, the present review provides pediatric and adult cardiac care providers with a contemporary framework in PDA care to support the practice of evidence-based medicine.

### Ductus arteriosus: more than just the patent ductus arteriosus [^113VFwRq]. Pediatric Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

The ductus arteriosus is important to fetal circulation. Failure to close at birth is a common event. In this educational pictorial essay, we illustrate the association of the ductus arteriosus with a variety of congenital cardiac, vascular and pulmonary lesions. These lesions can impact the systemic circulation, the pulmonary circulation or the airway and include coarctation of the aorta, ductal origin of the pulmonary artery and vascular rings.

### Patent ductus arteriosus: a contemporary perspective for the pediatric and adult cardiac care provider [^111rH4aw]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

PDA is a complex pathophysiology, resulting in markedly variable clinical consequences. To provide more targeted, individualized treatments, a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of ductal closure, the effect of each patient's clinical and echocardiographic biomarkers on both treatment success and improved outcomes, as well as genetic variants in drug metabolism and drug targets should be prioritized. Irrespective of patient age, incorporating clinical and cardiac imaging parameters that recognize a hierarchal model of adverse ductal sequalae is recommended. The critical need for contemporary, pragmatic clinical trials that evaluate the impact of existing PDA treatments on important patient outcomes is acknowledged.

Abstract

The burden of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) continues to be significant. In view of marked differences in preterm infants versus more mature, term counterparts (viewed on a continuum with adolescent and adult patients), mechanisms regulating ductal patency, genetic contributions, clinical consequences, and diagnostic and treatment thresholds are discussed separately, when appropriate. Among both preterm infants and older children and adults, a range of hemodynamic profiles highlighting the markedly variable consequences of the PDA are provided. In most contemporary settings, transcatheter closure is preferable over surgical ligation, but data on longer‐term outcomes, particularly among preterm infants, are lacking. The present review provides recommendations to identify gaps in PDA diagnosis, management, and treatment on which subsequent research can be developed. Ultimately, the combination of refined diagnostic thresholds and expanded treatment options provides the best opportunities to address the burden of PDA. Although fundamental gaps remain unanswered, the present review provides pediatric and adult cardiac care providers with a contemporary framework in PDA care to support the practice of evidence‐based medicine.

### Stenting the ductus arteriosus in neonates with ductal-dependent pulmonary blood flow: technical and anatomic considerations [^113WEKUN]. Pediatric Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) stenting is rapidly emerging as an initial palliative option for infants with cyanotic congenital heart disease and ductal-dependent pulmonary blood flow. Although less invasive than surgical systemic to pulmonary shunt placement, the procedure is technically challenging with a notable learning curve. The highly variable anatomy of the PDA contributes to procedural complexity, success rates, and adverse outcomes. This technical review proposes a scheme of best practices for PDA stenting based on the authors' experience and existing literature. We review pre-, intra-, and post-catheterization care, with an in-depth discussion of procedural strategy, equipment selection, and technical pitfalls relevant to each morphologic PDA sub-type.

### Diagnosis, evaluation, and management of patent ductus arteriosus in preterm neonates [^116g4EQ4]. JAMA Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) poses a diagnostic and therapeutic dilemma for clinicians. Diagnosis of persistent PDA and determination of its clinical and hemodynamic significance are challenging. Although the condition has been associated with substantial neonatal morbidities such as intraventricular hemorrhage, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and necrotizing enterocolitis, most therapeutic approaches have failed to show improvement in these outcomes. As such, clinicians have tended toward conservative management strategies; however, the benefits and risks of such an approach are unclear. In this review, we explore various clinical diagnostic modalities, echocardiographic parameters for assessment of shunt presence, shunt volume and its effect on cardiovascular and hemodynamic status, and challenges in determining if a PDA is hemodynamically significant and clinically relevant. From the therapeutic aspect, we review current evidence on conservative, pharmacological, and mechanical (surgical or nonsurgical ligation) approaches to PDA closure. Dose, route, duration, and comparison of pharmacological strategies are reviewed, with implications for future research.

### Patent ductus arteriosus in preterm infants [^112sqteu]. Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Despite a large body of basic science and clinical research and clinical experience with thousands of infants over nearly 6 decades,(1) there is still uncertainty and controversy about the significance, evaluation, and management of patent ductus arteriosus in preterm infants, resulting in substantial heterogeneity in clinical practice. The purpose of this clinical report is to summarize the evidence available to guide evaluation and treatment of preterm infants with prolonged ductal patency in the first few weeks after birth.

### Outcome following patent ductus arteriosus ligation in premature infants: a retrospective cohort analysis [^117VGr3y]. BMC Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

Conclusion

This study shows that patent ductus arteriosus ligation is a relatively safe procedure (30 day survival 92%) but there is substantial late mortality and a high incidence of morbidity in the survivors. 2 or more courses of PSI prior to surgical ligation trends to increased oxygen dependence and chronic lung disease. This high risk population requires careful, long term follow-up. A definitive prospective cohort study is lacking.

### Patent ductus arteriosus, its treatments, and the risks of pulmonary morbidity [^114AxfY6]. Seminars in Perinatology (2018). Low credibility.

A persistent left-to-right shunt through a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) increases the rate of hydrostatic fluid filtration into the lung's interstitium, impairs pulmonary mechanics, and prolongs the need for mechanical ventilation. In preclinical trials, pharmacologic PDA closure leads to improved alveolarization and minimizes the impaired postnatal alveolar development that is the pathologic hallmark of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Although routine prophylactic treatment of a PDA on the day of birth does not appear to offer any more protection against BPD than delaying treatment for 2–3 days, recent evidence from quality improvement trials suggests that early pharmacologic treatment decreases the incidence of BPD compared with a treatment approach that exposes infants to a moderate-to-large PDA shunt for the first 7–10 days after birth. After the first week, routine pharmacologic treatment (compared with continued PDA exposure) no longer appears to alter the course of BPD development. Evidence from epidemiologic, preclinical, and randomized controlled trials demonstrate that early ductus ligation is an independent risk factor for the development of BPD.

Treatment Gaps

Vulnerable pediatric populations demand rigorous benefit–risk assessment in clinical decision making. 3 Echocardiography is the first‐line modality to quantify PDA‐associated shunt and its impact on the cardiopulmonary system. Patients with PDA with hemodynamic overload and organ failure symptomatology face the prospect of a poor outcome, requiring implementation of consensus‐based advanced therapy. In premature babies with no contraindications, an attempt to close a symptomatic PDA is initiated using pharmacotherapy with prostaglandin inhibitors that modulate ductus contraction. Yet, the average 68% success rate of 14 widely used clinical protocols mandates escalation in therapy through invasive correction or additional rounds of treatment in initial nonresponders 2 that could result from an inadequate management regimen and/or a diverse recalcitrant disease pathobiology. Pharmacotherapy for preterm PDA relies on 5 decades of clinical experience yet has not reached standardization. Selection of most effective timing, best agent, dose, and delivery means have all been central to the quest for best practice.

Clinical experience indicates an age‐dependent response to pharmacological ductus closure. 3 There is consensus that prostaglandin inhibitors are contraindicated for PDA in babies born at full term. The principle of "do no harm" in the setting of full‐term PDA was established more than 3 decades ago, and further clinical trials have been discouraged. Nonpharmacological management, i.e. catheter‐based PDA occlusion or surgical ligation necessitating thoracotomy, is the standard of care for full‐term PDA.

Prophylactic PDA closure is not supported by ongoing clinical studies. Accordingly, nonsymptomatic PDA, which may or may not be diagnosed during infancy, is conservatively managed until disease progression qualifies for invasive closure. 1 This "wait for surgery" schedule contributes to the growing number of adults with PDA, estimated at a quarter of a million living Americans. Thus, development of alternative therapeutic strategies aimed at early rescue is warranted, capturing the disease process in its evolution.

### Patent ductus arteriosus: pathophysiology and management [^115WKVXq]. Journal of Perinatology (2006). Low credibility.

Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in preterm newborns prior to 28 weeks of gestation has led to many challenges regarding the type and timing of treatment regimens. A PDA results in increased pulmonary blood flow and redistribution of flow to other organs. Several co-morbidities (i.e., necrotizing enterocolitis, intracranial hemorrhage, pulmonary edema/hemorrhage, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and retinopathy) are associated with the presence of a PDA, but whether or not a PDA is responsible for their development is still unclear. The prostaglandin inhibitor, indomethacin, is effective in the treatment of PDA. Questions regarding the optimal timing of the intervention — early prophylaxis or treatment, once signs and symptoms become evident — have challenged physicians for decades. Both evidence and experience are explored in this article. Comparative physiology between the full-term and preterm newborn and the barriers preventing the necessary cascade of events leading to permanent constriction of the PDA are reviewed.

Figure 1
Circulatory adaptation at birth. The ductus arteriosus, or ductus Botalli, is a fetal artery that is open in utero and spontaneously closes at birth. Ductus closure reflects an endogenous homeostatic response in conjunction with adequate sensing of environmental change, followed by smooth muscle contraction and vascular remodeling finalized in the form of a fibrotic remnant. Ductus dysregulation is the result of individual or multiple pathobiological events that induce persistent patency after birth, known as a patent ductus arteriosus.

The mechanisms of perinatal ductus regulation are complex and at present not fully understood. Natural closure is triggered by the transition at birth from the intrauterine to the extrauterine environment (Figure 1). The surge in blood oxygen tension and the concomitant drop in placenta‐produced/lung‐metabolized prostaglandins are mediators of ductus smooth muscle contraction. Moreover, the postnatal rapid decline in pulmonary vascular resistance promotes collapse of the ductus cavity. The squeezed ductus, with trapped blood clot, cuts the flow within hours to days after birth. Fibrotic remodeling ensues and culminates within months after birth, completing the transition to a ductus‐independent postnatal circulation.

Multiple causes of ductus malfunction can lead to PDA. They encompass defective metabolic pathways and associated sensing, and/or aberrant processes of functional/structural closure. Clinical risk factors precipitating disease prevalence include gestational age, along with confounding chromosomal anomalies. Indeed, more than 250 genetic disorders have been linked to PDA, in particular trisomy 21 or Down syndrome, where PDA is integral to a syndromic presentation. Manifestation of PDA can range from a silent to an overt condition, depending on the severity of the patency‐associated shunt.

### Hemodynamic considerations in preterm infants born at less than 25 weeks gestation [^1131pqGs]. Seminars in Perinatology (2022). Medium credibility.

As survival rates continue to improve for infants born at less than 25 weeks gestation, delineating normal cardiovascular physiology from pathophysiology becomes much more challenging. With a paucity of 'normative' data for such infants, an over-reliance on studies at older gestations can result in a 'best guess' approach. Here we offer a pragmatic approach to these diagnostic challenges from a cardiovascular viewpoint. An appreciation of the unique physiology, from the immature myocardium and altered vascular tone to an innately large patent ductus arteriosus is essential, as is a thorough history for case specific contributing factors. We explore the additional difficulties in achieving a balance between minimal handling at the bedside and delineating important objective markers of perfusion. Finally, we discuss treatment approaches including inotrope therapy and patent ductus treatment, acknowledging the limited data available to guide these decisions.

### Patent ductus arteriosus: a contemporary perspective for the pediatric and adult cardiac care provider [^112haxBa]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

EPIDEMIOLOGY

PDA represents the most common cardiovascular condition of preterm infants, and the incidence of PDA is inversely related to gestational age at birth. Recent evidence suggests that > 50% of infants born at < 26 weeks of gestation have an open ductus beyond 2 months postnatal. Data among term infants suggest that PDAs are observed in ≈1 in 2000 births, accounting for 5% to 10% of all congenital heart disease. Longitudinal cohort studies suggest that the incidence of "silent" PDA, those cases discovered by cardiac imaging in the absence of clinical manifestations, approach 1 in 20 births.

Congenital heart disease began to be a treatable condition when, in 1938, Robert Edward Gross first successfully ligated a persistent ductus arteriosus. This overview traces the historical development from Munro's first idea of how to close a patent ductus, presented in 1907, to the clinical ligation or division of the ductus. Surgical treatment of the infected ductus began with an unsuccessful attempt by Strieder, but it was not until Tubbs' and Touroff's successful operations that it was actually accomplished.

Conclusions

This meta‐analysis demonstrated that PDA stent has a similar hazard of mortality compared with APS. There are benefits to PDA stent, including shorter duration of mechanical ventilation support, shorter hospital and ICU LOS, and fewer procedural complications. The existing literature supports differences in patient characteristics with more patients with PA‐IVS and expected biventricular repair undergoing PDA stent.

### Insights into the pathogenesis and genetic background of patency of the ductus arteriosus [^116VKQnd]. Neonatology (2010). Low credibility.

The unique differentiation program of the ductus arteriosus (DA) is essential for its specific task during fetal life and for the adapting circulation after birth. Phenotypic changes occur in the DA during the normal maturation and definitive closure. Morphological abnormalities of the vessel wall characterize the persistent DA (PDA) in older children. Here, we give an overview of the animal models of DA regulation and remodeling. Genetic research has identified the cause of syndromic forms of PDA, such as the TFAP2B mutations in Char syndrome. Genes that interfere with the remodeling of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) of the ductal media are affected in virtually all of these anomalies. Therefore, the pivotal regulatory role of VSMCs is emphasized. A better understanding of the genetic background of this developmental process may help develop new strategies to manipulate the DA in premature infants, neonates with duct-dependent anomalies, and patients with syndromic and non-syndromic PDA.

### The ductus arteriosus: a refined approach! [^113qSYtV]. Seminars in Perinatology (2012). Low credibility.

Although ongoing patency of the ductus arteriosus is common in small extremely preterm infants, consensus is lacking regarding its clinical significance and treatment strategies. Literature regarding likelihood of spontaneous closure, impact on neonatal morbidity and long-term outcomes, and adverse effects of intervention has led to uncertainty as to the best course of action. Enhancing the determination of hemodynamic significance and refining patient selection for therapeutic intervention will streamline the decision-making process. Targeted neonatal echocardiography performed by the clinician has gained popularity worldwide, and preliminary data show that it has the potential to optimize patient outcomes. We review the arguments for and against medical and surgical therapy, explore how targeted neonatal echocardiography used in conjunction with biomarkers may refine the treatment approach, and consider future directions in the field.

### Learning to live with patency of the ductus arteriosus in preterm infants [^116zbEJ8]. Journal of Perinatology (2011). Low credibility.

Treatment of persistent patency of the ductus arteriosus in preterm infants remains heterogeneous and controversial. Routine early treatment to induce ductal closure is not beneficial, but the potential criteria for, timing of, methods for and benefits of later ductal closure have not been determined. Management strategies for infants awaiting spontaneous closure or meeting criteria for treatment may be based on pathophysiological considerations but require evaluation in clinical trials. Better diagnostic tools allowing the identification of infants who might benefit from ductal closure, supplemented by data from clinical trials confirming realization of that potential, are urgently needed.

Methods

Study design and study population

This was a prospective cohort study performed in the Rotunda Hospital neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), a level three NICU, Dublin, Ireland. Ethical approval was granted from the Hospital Research Ethics Committee. Infants born < 29 weeks gestation between July 2020 and March 2024 (the early-targeted treatment epoch) were considered eligible for inclusion. This cohort was compared with a reference cohort of infants < 29 weeks gestation born prior to 2015 (the reference epoch) who did not receive early treatment for a PDA, as was the policy in the unit at the time. Infants from the reference epoch had the PDAsc applied to initial echocardiograms, which determined whether they were deemed high- or low-risk.

Infants born < 29 weeks gestation represent a high-risk cohort particularly vulnerable to the haemodynamic and clinical sequelae associated with a PDA. This gestational age cut-off aligns with prior research on PDA risk stratification and management. The historical reference epoch (before 2015) was specifically selected as infants from this conservative management era were used to originally devise and validate the EL-Khuffash PDAsc, providing us with readily available scores for meaningful comparisons. Between 2015 and 2020, our neonatal unit conducted the PDA RCT evaluating the clinical utility of the PDAsc, which subsequently informed and led to the formal introduction of the early-targeted risk-based management strategy in July 2020.

Patient and public involvement

No patient involved.

Exclusion criteria

Neonates were excluded from the study if they had ductal-dependent congenital heart disease; if they did not obtain an initial screening echocardiogram due to haemodynamic clinician unavailability; or if there was evidence of pulmonary hypertension (bidirectional or right-to-left shunt) on the initial echocardiogram.

### At a crossroads for early medical treatment of persistent patent ductus arteriosus in preterm infants [^1131kpVo]. Journal of Perinatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Administration of early medical therapy for the patent ductus arteriosus has ebbed and flowed through the years, with a multitude of studies failing to demonstrate a reduction in morbidity or mortality from ductal closure in the preterm population. Concerningly, an increasing number of studies have demonstrated an increase in morbidity, such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia and mortality with the use of early medical therapy to close the ductus. Considering information regarding potential risk without clear benefit in an overall cohort of preterm patients with a patent ductus, use of early medical therapy is increasingly challenging to justify and necessitates studies that will aid in identifying a patient population that would benefit from ductal closure and timing of therapy.

### Using omics to breathe new life into our understanding of the ductus arteriosus oxygen response [^114shk7N]. Seminars in Perinatology (2023). Medium credibility.

The ductus arteriosus (DA) connects the aorta to the pulmonary artery (PA), directing placentally oxygenated blood away from the developing lungs. High pulmonary vascular resistance and low systemic vascular resistance facilitate shunting of blood in utero from the pulmonary to the systemic circulation through the widely patent DA, thereby optimizing fetal oxygen (O 2) delivery. With the transition from fetal (hypoxia) to neonatal (normoxia) oxygen conditions, the DA constricts while the PA dilates. This process often fails in prematurity, promoting congenital heart disease. Impaired O 2 -responsivness in the DA promotes persistent ductus arteriosus (PDA), the most common form of congenital heart disease. Knowledge of DA oxygen sensing has greatly advanced in the past few decades, however we still lack a complete understanding of the sensing mechanism. The genomic revolution of the past two decades has facilitated unprecedented discovery in every biological system. This review will demonstrate how multiomic integration of data generated from the DA can breathe new life into our understanding of the DA's oxygen response.

### Diagnosis of the preterm patent ductus arteriosus: clinical signs, biomarkers, or ultrasound? [^1174pFh4]. Seminars in Perinatology (2012). Low credibility.

The current uncertainty in relation to treatment of the preterm patent ductus arteriosus reflects limitations to our understanding of the pathophysiology of ductal shunting, most particularly which ducts matter to which babies and when they matter. Doppler ultrasound offers a pragmatic tool with which to assess ductal patency and shunt significance and to allow prediction of spontaneous and therapeutic closure. Biomarkers, such as B-type natriuretic peptide, and clinical signs may have a diagnostic role where ultrasound is not available and also possibly as an adjunct to echocardiography in determining the pathophysiological impact of a ductal shunt in an individual baby.

Non-fatal disease estimates

Starting with GBD 2016, in consultation with GBD experts and paediatric cardiology experts, we have reorganised cause categories for non-fatal estimates to be more anatomically oriented, clinically relevant, and structured in a way to facilitate incorporation of literature, registry, and administrative data to inform levels and trends. These five congenital heart disease categories are named descriptively as: single ventricle and single ventricle pathway congenital heart anomalies; severe congenital heart anomalies excluding single ventricle heart defects; critical malformations of great vessels, congenital valvular heart disease, and patent ductus arteriosus; ventricular septal defect and atrial septal defect; and other congenital heart anomalies.

ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes mapped to each category are shown in the appendix (p 11).

Five separate DisMod-MR 2.1 models were developed for each of the congenital heart disease categories. DisMod-MR 2.1 is a compartmental model consisting of three states — susceptible, diseased, and dead — with state transitions determined by the incidence, remission rate, excess mortality, and other-cause mortality. DisMod-MR 2.1 uses a geographical cascade to borrow strength across geography and time, balancing a set of differential equations to find an internally consistent numerical solution for each age, sex, location, and year that best reflects the input data and any specified constraints on values of the calculated rates. Incidence was set to 0 for all congenital models, as congenital conditions occur at the time of birth and by definition there are no incident cases after birth. Remission was bounded to 0% for all subcause models except ventricular and atrial septal defect, for which it was constrained to be between 0% and 20% per year until age 10 years on the basis of the values that corresponded to observed spontaneous closure in longitudinal studies. For most of the severe congenital conditions, the mortality associated with the condition is highly dependent on access to adequate surgical interventions and other medical care during the first hours, weeks, and years of life. Therefore, a decreasing slope on excess mortality was applied to capture the highest risk of mortality from congenital conditions in the neonatal age groups and a subsequent decreasing risk of mortality from congenital conditions later in life. Model covariates and calculated coefficients for each are shown in the appendix (pp 21, 22).

### Interactions of patent ductus arteriosus and ventilation on preterm pulmonary vascular disease [^114VjKte]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Among the 20% of extremely preterm infants who develop bronchopulmonary dysplasia‐associated pulmonary hypertension (BPD‐PH), up to 40% will die within 1 year of diagnosis. To our knowledge, there is no known intervention that can reduce risk for BPD‐PH development, as very few randomized trials have investigated BPD‐PH prevention.

Prior observational studies have identified invasive ventilation and a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) exposure among the strongest predictors of BPD‐PH development. Less invasive respiratory support strategies reduce risk for bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) or death. Although randomized trials of PDA interventions have not shown a reduction in BPD, key questions persist — such as whether device closure at later postnatal ages may improve respiratory outcomes. Another critical residual knowledge gap is whether these common exposures specifically modulate BPD‐PH development. This specific and most severe BPD phenotype has not been systematically reported in randomized trials of respiratory or PDA management.

We hypothesized that ventilator days and PDA exposure days increase the risk of BPD‐PH in a dose‐dependent and synergistic manner.

Patent ductus arteriosus — surgical/interventional approach notes that the 2 approaches are surgical closure and percutaneous catheter closure; surgical closure in adults may pose problems due to friability and/or calcification of the ductus, atherosclerosis, aneurysm formation, and comorbid conditions that may adversely affect perioperative risk; adults with PDA are better suited for percutaneous closure with an occlusion device or coils because of its high success and few complications; and percutaneous closure of the PDA before other cardiac surgery may decrease the risk of cardiopulmonary bypass when other surgical correction is required.

Methods

Study design and patients

This study was a post-hoc analysis of the PLASE study, a prospective multicenter cohort study that included 710 preterm infants at 34 NICUs in Japan. The studyhad the following predefined inclusion criteria: (1) gestational age at birth between 23 weeks and 0 day and 29 weeks and 6 days, (2) admission to a participating NICU within 24 h of birth, and (3) surviving beyond the first 24 h after birth. The studyexcluded patients with (1) chromosomal abnormalities; (2) multiple anomalies, apparent clinical syndrome, or congenital anomalies that required surgery during infancy; (3) congenital heart disease other than PDA, patent foramen ovale, and persistent left superior vena cava; (4) congenital metabolic, endocrine, neuromuscular, or systemic bone disease; (5) family history of severe hereditary diseases such as neuromuscular disease or cardiomyopathy; and (6) critical conditions deemed ineligible for this study by attending physicians. Among them, we excluded patients who lacked any of the echocardiographic measurements of the PDAd, LPAedv, and left atrial to aortic diameter ratio (LA/Ao) at 3 days of age. We selected these three echocardiographic indices (PDAd, LPAedv, and LA/Ao) as potential dependent variables based on findings from a previous study, which identified them as having the three highest unadjusted and adjusted areas under the curve values for predicting future surgery. We also excluded patients who underwent PDA surgery before echocardiography evaluation at 3 days of age. The details of the echocardiographic examinations have been described in previous reports. All echocardiographers were assessed and met predefined quality control criteria for accurate echocardiographic measurements before data acquisition. Most were experienced neonatologists who routinely performed echocardiography to assess cardiac function and PDA among preterm infants in their daily clinical practice. The decision to surgically close the PDA was left to the discretion of the physicians or surgeons and was based on clinical conditions such as hemodynamic instability, feeding problems, and further renal or respiratory impairment.

### The role of patent ductus arteriosus and its treatments in the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia [^11275TJM]. Seminars in Perinatology (2013). Low credibility.

A persistent left-to-right shunt through a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) increases the rate of hydrostatic fluid filtration into the lung's interstitium, impairs pulmonary mechanics, and prolongs the need for mechanical ventilation. In preclinical trials, pharmacologic PDA closure leads to improved alveolarization and minimizes the impaired postnatal alveolar development that is the pathologic hallmark of the "new bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD)". Although early pharmacologic closure of the PDA decreases the incidence of pulmonary hemorrhage, intraventricular hemorrhage, and the need for PDA ligation, there is little evidence from controlled, clinical trials to support or refute a causal role for the PDA in the development of BPD. However, evidence from epidemiologic, preclinical, and randomized controlled clinical trials demonstrate that early ductus ligation is an independent risk factor for the development of BPD and may directly contribute to the neonatal morbidities it is trying to prevent.

### Maldevelopment of the immature pulmonary vasculature and prolonged patency of the ductus arteriosus: association or cause? [^113ABmCs]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Nearly half to two-thirds of extremely preterm infants (< 28 weeks of gestation) have moderate to large patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) shunts, which may lead to sustained exposure to excessive pulmonary blood flow (Qp) for days to weeks. Natural history studies of extremely preterm infants report a median time of PDA closure of 72 days. The association of PDA and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is well documented; recent evidence highlights the increased likelihood of the most severe forms of BPD in patients with both prolonged mechanical ventilation and exposure to a large PDA (Figure 1). The relationship of prolonged PDA exposure to pulmonary vascular maldevelopment, however, and its most severe form, pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), although biologically plausible, has received little scientific investigation. Almost 70 years ago, Hultgren and colleagues first reported the development of PAH, on either cardiac catheterization or autopsy, in eight patients after prolonged PDA exposure. Randomized clinical trials to date have focused exclusively on modulation of BPD, without any consideration of the impact on the immature pulmonary vascular bed or risk of PAH. Therefore, the direct effect of a prolonged PDA shunt, indirect effects through BPD development, and modulator effects of PDA treatment on pulmonary vascular remodeling and PAH remains unknown.

Patent ductus arteriosus — follow-up and Eisenmenger considerations highlight that adults with large PDAs are likely to have Eisenmenger physiology and require frequent follow-up; after surgical/PDA closure, patients can be discharged safely from follow-up once complete closure of the ductus is documented by TTE; antibiotic prophylaxis is discontinued 6 months after PDA closure; and follow-up approximately every 5 years for patients who received a device is recommended due to lack of long-term device-closure data.

### Device closure of hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus in Premature infants [^111x3bMp]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

The patent ductus arteriosus is a very common condition in preterm infants, and a hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus increases morbidity and mortality in these vulnerable patients. However, despite numerous randomized controlled trials, there is no consensus regarding management. Medical therapy is typically offered as first-line treatment, although it yields limited success and carries the potential for severe adverse events. In recent years, there has been rapid development in transcatheter patent ductus arteriosus closure primary with the use of the Amplatzer Piccolo Occluder, and this has gained widespread acceptance as a safe and effective alternative to surgical ligation in extremely low-birth-weight infants weighing over 700 g. This article aims to provide an appraisal of the patient selection process, a step-by-step procedural guide, and a comprehensive review of the outcomes associated with this approach.

### Patent ductus arteriosus in preterm infants: is early transcatheter closure a paradigm shift? [^116UmbWz]. Journal of Perinatology (2019). Medium credibility.

The optimal management approach of the patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in premature infants remains uncertain owing the lack of evidence for long-term benefits and the limited analyses of the complications of medical and surgical interventions to date. In recent years, devices suitable to plug the PDA of premature infants (including extremely low birthweight, < 1000g) have become available and several trials have demonstrated successful and safe transcatheter PDA closure (TCPC) in this population. Whether TCPC represents a paradigm shift in PDA management that will result in improved short- and long-term outcomes, less bronchopulmonary dysplasia, improved neurodevelopment, or better long term renal function remains to be seen. Careful rigorous study of the potential benefits of TCPC in this highly vulnerable population in the context of well-designed adequately powered trials is needed prior to widespread adoption of this approach.

Patent ductus arteriosus in adults — calcification and tissue friability make surgery more hazardous than in the child, and in older adults a calcified ductus poses a surgical risk such that catheter intervention should be the first option; when PDA occurs in isolation device closure is usually feasible and the need for surgical closure is uncommon; when other cardiac operations are required, preoperative device closure should be considered because ductal calcification can increase surgical risk; the majority of PDAs (greater than 95%) can be closed by operation, early mortality is low, and recanalization is rare.

### Patent ductus arteriosus stent versus surgical aortopulmonary shunt for initial palliation of cyanotic congenital heart disease with ductal-dependent pulmonary blood flow: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114gCW6v]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Establishing a stable source of pulmonary blood flow is crucial in patients with cyanotic congenital heart disease (CHD) and ductal‐dependent pulmonary blood flow (DDPBF). Historically, this was achieved through a surgical aortopulmonary shunt (APS). APS may promote pulmonary artery growth and thus allow for the next stage palliation or corrective procedure to be performed in the future. However, there remains a significant risk of morbidity and mortality with this surgical procedure. Over the last decade, PDA stent has emerged as a viable alternative to APS. Ductal stent is a less invasive approach compared with APS and avoids the need for cardiopulmonary bypass in the vulnerable neonatal period which allows for faster recovery. Nevertheless, PDA stent also carries risks of procedural complications and increased need for reinterventions.

Comparisons between the PDA stent and APS have been limited primarily to single‐center studies and only a few recent multicenter retrospective studies. Limitations in statistical power may limit the conclusions of many studies. Additionally, the management of DDPBF is evolving at many institutions towards using PDA stent in select patients and there is a critical need for an objective appraisal of the current evidence. A meta‐analysis increases the number of observations resulting in better statistical power and objectively assesses the level of evidence. Thus, this study aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta‐analysis to compare mortality risk and clinical outcomes after PDA stent and APS in cyanotic CHD with DDPBF.

### Interventions for patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in preterm infants: an overview of cochrane systematic reviews [^112MymwN]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

The need for subsequent open‐label therapy, including definitive surgical PDA closure, also highlights the fact that medical therapy, though better than placebo, is by no means a highly effective option for PDA closure. Therefore, most RCTs of medical treatment were essentially trials of drug therapy, rather than the elimination of the PDA shunt. Therefore, despite growing calls for accepting the null hypothesis and abandoning further clinical trials on PDA management, the current evidence underscores the need to clearly establish which PDA shunts, if any, are associated with worse clinical outcomes, and pursue further clinical trials that include only those infants at the highest risk of PDA‐attributable morbidities, and explore highly effective and safe shunt elimination strategies for such clinically important PDA shunts.

### Application of NPE in the assessment of a patent ductus arteriosus [^113yxuqw]. Pediatric Research (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

The significance of a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) and its impact on long-term cardiorespiratory health remain areas of ongoing debate in neonatology. Even the persistent patency of a PDA is a clinical conundrum, as most premature neonates in whom the PDA fails to close in the first week of age or even by the time of discharge will undergo spontaneous closure without experiencing significant cardiac morbidity. Although prolonged patency may be associated with numerous adverse outcomes, the extent to which these adverse outcomes are attributable to the hemodynamic consequences of ductal patency, if at all, has not been established. Currently, echocardiography is the most clinically applicable modality for identifying a PDA, with Neonatologist Performed Echocardiography (NPE) potentially playing an essential role in devising treatment options and assessing their impact on the preterm circulation. Centers that develop NPE may greatly benefit from the "unfettered" access to echocardiography with a targeted approach that focuses on the high-risk patient population with specific hemodynamic characteristics receiving treatment.

The purpose of this review is not to advise on treatment options, but to provide a practice guideline on how to evaluate hemodynamic significance and characterize shunt volume using NPE. Specifically, in this review, we discuss the current and emerging ultrasound measurements available to identify and monitor a PDA in the preterm infant. We offer recommendations for using NPE to optimize the management of a neonate with a PDA and understand its contribution to overall pathophysiology in neonates.

### Patent ductus arteriosus, bronchopulmonary dysplasia and pulmonary hypertension-a complex conundrum with many phenotypes? [^113pdUEg]. Pediatric Research (2023). Medium credibility.

While the authors provide important and novel data on the relationship of prolonged PDA exposure to pulmonary vascular development, their data is a perfect illustration of the complexity of the premature infant's cardiovascular and respiratory systems. Clinicians should be alerted to the fact that under the umbrella of "BPD" exists many distinct phenotypes (lung parenchymal phenotype, pulmonary vascular phenotype, flow driven phenotype, post-capillary phenotype and an admixture of all) which require an individualistic approach to monitoring and treatment. It is unlikely that a truly significant PDA with chronic left to right shunting plays no role in vascular remodeling over the first few weeks of age. Going forward, the neonatal haemodynamic community should continue to enhance standardization of definitions of a haemodynamically significant PDA, particularly in the setting of clinical trials, and prospectively evaluate the impact of prolonged exposure on the immature pulmonary vascular bed, right ventricle, and left heart.

### International online survey on the management of patent ductus arteriosus [^116WgsoL]. Neonatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

There is uncertainty and lack of consensus regarding optimal management of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). We aimed to determine current clinical practice in PDA management across a range of different regions internationally.

Materials and Methods

We surveyed PDA management practices in neonatal intensive care units using a pre-piloted web-based survey, which was distributed to perinatal societies in 31 countries. The survey was available online from March 2018 to March 2019.

Results

There were 812 responses. The majority of clinicians (54%) did not have institutional protocols for PDA treatment, and 42% reported variable management within their own unit. Among infants <28 weeks (or <1,000 g), most clinicians (60%) treat symptomatically. Respondents in Australasia were more likely to treat PDA pre-symptomatically (44% vs. 18% all countries [OR 4.1; 95% CI 2.6–6.5; p < 0.001]), and respondents from North America were more likely to treat symptomatic PDA (67% vs. 60% all countries [OR 2.0; 95% CI 1.5–2.6; p < 0.001]). In infants ≥ 28 weeks (or ≥ 1,000 g), most clinicians (54%) treat symptomatically. Respondents in North America were more likely to treat PDAs in this group of infants conservatively (47% vs. 38% all countries [OR 2.3; 95% CI 1.7–3.2; p < 0.001]), and respondents from Asia were more likely to treat the PDA pre-symptomatically (21% vs. 7% all countries [OR 5.5; 95% CI 3.2–9.8; p < 0.001]).

Discussion/Conclusion

There were marked international differences in clinical practice, highlighting ongoing uncertainty and a lack of consensus regarding PDA management. An international conglomeration to coordinate research that prioritises and addresses these areas of contention is indicated.

### Patent ductus arteriosus of the preterm infant [^112LiL3P]. Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

A persistently patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in preterm infants can have significant clinical consequences, particularly during the recovery period from respiratory distress syndrome. With improvement of ventilation and oxygenation, the pulmonary vascular resistance decreases early and rapidly, especially in very immature infants with extremely low birth weight (< 1000 g). Subsequently, the left-to-right shunt through the ductus arteriosus (DA) is augmented, thereby increasing pulmonary blood flow, which leads to pulmonary edema and overall worsening of cardiopulmonary status. Prolonged ventilation, with the potential risks of volutrauma, barotrauma, and hyperoxygenation, is strongly associated with the development and severity of bronchopulmonary dysplasia/chronic lung disease. Substantial left-to-right shunting through the ductus may also increase the risk of intraventricular hemorrhage, necrotizing enterocolitis, and death. Postnatal ductal closure is regulated by exposure to oxygen and vasodilators; the ensuing vascular responses, mediated by potassium channels, voltage-gated calcium channels, mitochondrial-derived reactive oxygen species, and endothelin 1, depend on gestational age. Platelets are recruited to the luminal aspect of the DA during closure and probably promote thrombotic sealing of the constricted DA. Currently, it is unclear whether and when a conservative, pharmacologic, or surgical approach for PDA closure may be advantageous. Furthermore, it is unknown if prophylactic and/or symptomatic PDA therapy will cause substantive improvements in outcome. In this article we review the mechanisms underlying DA closure, risk factors and comorbidities of significant DA shunting, and current clinical evidence and areas of uncertainty in the diagnosis and treatment of PDA of the preterm infant.

### Impact of pulse oximetry screening on the detection of duct dependent congenital heart disease: a Swedish prospective screening study in 39, 821 newborns [^1174cHpM]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Cardiovascular malformations are the commonest type of congenital malformation, but a sizeable proportion are not detected by routine neonatal examination. Cardiovascular malformations account for 6–10% of all infant deaths and 20–40% of deaths caused by congenital malformation. About 1–1.8 babies per 1000 live births have a duct dependent circulation, with a persistent ductus arteriosus being necessary for survival. These babies are at particular risk from the worldwide trend towards early discharge from maternity units, as the effects of ductal closure may not be apparent at an early discharge examination. Some 10–30% of babies who die from congenital heart disease do not have their condition diagnosed before autopsy. In Sweden over the past decade increasing proportions of babies with critical congenital heart disease have been leaving hospital with their condition undiagnosed.

Screening infants with non-invasive measurement of oxygen saturation has been proposed as an aid for early detection of duct dependent circulation, but the studies to date have been too small to enable proper estimates of sensitivity, and only two studies have included ascertainment of missed cases dying in the community. An attempt to estimate the sensitivity based on a meta-analysis was unsatisfactory because of the merging of studies with different probe sites, different cut-off values for saturation, and different oximeters measuring either functional or fractional saturation. We evaluated strategies to maximise sensitivity while minimising false positives in a screening test for duct dependent circulation with a new generation oximeter which measured functional oxygen saturation preductally (in right hand) and postductally (in either foot). We arrived at optimal screening cut-off values of < 95% saturation or > 3% difference between right hand and foot. We also found that the type of oximeter used had a significant effect on both the detection rate and false positive rate.

### Patent ductus arteriosus stent versus surgical aortopulmonary shunt for initial palliation of cyanotic congenital heart disease with ductal-dependent pulmonary blood flow: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112SZ74P]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Background In patients with ductal-dependent pulmonary blood flow, initial palliation includes catheter-based patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) stent or surgical aortopulmonary shunt (APS). This meta-analysis aimed to compare outcomes between PDA stent and APS. Methods and Results A comprehensive literature search yielded six retrospective observational studies. Pooled adjusted hazard ratios (HR) were included to control for covariates and assess time to event analysis. Of 757 patients, 243 (32.1%) underwent PDA stent and 514 (67.9%) underwent APS. Pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum and expected biventricular repair were more common with PDA stent compared with APS (39.6% versus 21.2%, P < 0.001 and 57.9% versus 46.6%, P = 0.007, respectively). There was no statistically significant difference in mortality between PDA stent and APS (HR, 0.71; [95% CI, 0.26–1.93]; P = 0.50). PDA stent was associated with lower risk of postprocedural complications (odds ratio [OR], 0.45; [95% CI, 0.25–0.81]; P = 0.008), mechanical circulatory support (OR, 0.27; [95% CI, 0.09–0.79]; P = 0.02), and shorter intensive care unit length of stay (-4.03days; [95% CI, -5.99 to -2.07]; P < 0.001), hospital length of stay (-5.54days; [95% CI, -9.20 to -1.88]; P = 0.003), and duration of mechanical ventilation (-3.41days; [95% CI, -5.29 to -1.52]; P < 0.001). There was no difference in pulmonary artery growth or hazard of unplanned reintereventions. Conclusions PDA stent has a similar hazard of mortality compared with APS. Benefits to PDA stent include shorter duration of mechanical ventilation, shorter hospital length of stay, and fewer complications. Differences in patient characteristics exist with more patients with pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum and expected biventricular repair undergoing PDA stent.

### Stent implantation in the ductus arteriosus for pulmonary blood supply in congenital heart disease [^116e2F9V]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2004). Low credibility.

Indications for catheter-based interventions in patent ductus arteriosus (PDA)-dependent pulmonary blood flow have yet to be defined. The aim of this study was to assess the acute and midterm outcome after stent implantation in the PDA. Between 1996 and 2002, ductal stenting was performed in 21 neonates and infants (14 females/7 males) to maintain pulmonary blood supply in cyanotic congenital heart disease (CHD). Balloon-expandable stents were implanted in the PDA with a final diameter of 4–5 mm without procedural deaths. Stent patency was achieved for 8–1,130 days (median, 142). Reintervention was necessary in nine patients. Overall survival rate after 6 years was 86%. Two neonates died a few days after the procedure due to right heart failure not related to PDA stenting. Corrective surgery was possible in six patients. An additional aortopulmonary shunt was needed in three patients; Fontan type operations were performed in six. One patient died after bidirectional Glenn shunt, another five reached palliation by additional perforation of the atretic valve/balloon valvuloplasty, and two are awaiting surgery. We conclude that in many patients with cyanotic CHD, especially in those with ductal pulmonary perfusion and additional forward flow from the right ventricle, ductal stenting is an effective transcatheter approach. Morphology of the PDA predicts the risk of restenosis and necessity of reintervention. Growth of the pulmonary vascular bed allows corrective or palliative surgery, and some patients can be cured by the intervention alone.

Treatment of symptomatic infants

Death or moderate/severe neurodevelopmental disability
Failure of PDA closure after completion of allocated treatment
Proportion of infants requiring surgical ligation or transcatheter occlusion
All‐cause mortality any time prior to NICU discharge
CLD, defined as oxygen requirement at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age
Necrotising enterocolitis (NEC; stage 2 or greater)
Moderate/severe neurodevelopmental disability, assessed by a standardised and validated assessment tool, a child developmental specialist, or both, at any age reported (outcome data grouped at 12, 18, and 24 months, if available)

We reported the certainty of evidence as assessed by the review authors (who were in the best position to assess certainty given their familiarity with the study level data), using summary of findings tables from the reviews if provided.

The GRADE approach results in an assessment of the certainty of a body of evidence as one of four grades.

High certainty: further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect
Moderate certainty: further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect, and may change the estimate
Low certainty: further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect, and is likely to change the estimate
Very low certainty: we are very uncertain about the estimate

Data synthesis

We provided a narrative description of the characteristics of the included Cochrane Reviews. We then summarised the main results of the included reviews by categorising their findings, based on outcomes. We did not attempt to quantitatively synthesise the results using indirect comparison techniques, such as network meta‐analysis.

Subgroup analysis

If the information was available, we planned to separately report outcome results for the following subgroups.

### Percutaneous closure of the patent ductus arteriosus in very-low-weight infants [^1148j7Dg]. NeoReviews (2020). Medium credibility.

In view of the known complications of drug therapy and open surgical ligation, and the potential for prolonged patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) exposure to be harmful, health care practitioners have sought new approaches to achieve definitive ductal closure. Interest in percutaneous (catheter-based) PDA closure has emerged within the neonatal community as a viable treatment option, because it has been fueled by recent procedural and device modifications, as well as mounting feasibility and safety data. Herein, we provide a contemporary review of percutaneous PDA closure among infants at the crux of the medical debate-very-low-weight infants (≤ 1,500 g), including: 1) characterization of traditional PDA treatments (drug therapy, open surgical ligation) and conservative (nonintervention) management options; 2) a general overview of the major procedural steps of percutaneous ductal closure, including efforts to reduce thrombotic complications and the emergence of a novel US Food and Drug Administration-approved device; 3) a systematic review and meta-analysis to better understand risk profiles of percutaneous PDA closure in this population; and 4) discussion of current gaps in our understanding of optimal PDA care, including the critical need for well-designed, randomized, controlled clinical trials.

### The hemodynamically significant ductus arteriosus in critically ill full-term neonates. two case reports? [^116dK6UH]. Neonatology (2007). Low credibility.

In premature infants, the clinical effects and management of a hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus (HSDA) are well-described. In full-term neonates the ductus arteriosus (DA) is rarely monitored except in cases of concomitant pulmonary hypertension or duct dependent congenital heart disease. Although systemic-pulmonary shunting commonly occurs in mature infants, coinciding with the normal postnatal fall in pulmonary vascular resistance, cardiac failure in the neonatal period is rarely attributed directly to the DA. In this case series, we report two full-term infants who were initially treated for pulmonary hypertension and myocardial dysfunction but developed clinical, radiographic and two-dimensional echocardiographic evidence of cardiac failure secondary to a large unrestrictive patent DA (PDA). One patient was treated with indomethacin, and, although transductal diameter decreased, there was no clinical benefit. Cardiac failure resolved and myocardial function improved in both cases after PDA ligation. We suggest that PDA be monitored closely in neonates recovering from PPHN who have ongoing oxygenation difficulties or myocardial failure. PDA ligation should be considered an option for full term neonates with cardiac failure secondary to a HSDA when other therapeutic options fail.

### Spontaneous closure of patent ductus arteriosus in infants ≤ 1500 G [^115Ex65r]. Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) remains a challenging issue in very low birth weight (VLBW) infants, and its management varies widely. Our aim in this study was to document the natural course of ductus arteriosus in a cohort of VLBW infants who underwent conservative PDA management with no medical or surgical intervention.

Methods

A retrospective cohort study conducted in 2 European level-3 neonatal units.

Results

A total of 368 VLBW infants were born within the study period. Two hundred and ninety-seven infants were free of congenital malformations or heart defects and survived to hospital discharge. Out of those, 280 infants received truly conservative PDA management. In 237 (85%) of nontreated infants, the PDA closed before hospital discharge. The Kaplan-Meier model was used to document the incidence proportion of PDA closure over time for different gestational age groups. The median time to ductal closure was 71, 13, 8, and 6 days in < 26+0, 26+0 to 27+6, 28+0 to 29+6, and ≥ 30 weeks, respectively. For different birth weight groups, the median was 48, 22, 9, and 8 days in infants weighing < 750, 750 to 999, 1000 to 1249, and 1250 to 1500 g, respectively. No statistically significant relationship was found between PDA closure before hospital discharge and neonatal morbidities.

Conclusions

The likelihood of PDA spontaneous closure in VLBW infants is extremely high. We provide in our findings a platform for future placebo-controlled trials focused on the smallest and youngest infants.

### Outcome following patent ductus arteriosus ligation in premature infants: a retrospective cohort analysis [^1168bybK]. BMC Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

Background

The patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is an important problem in premature infants. Left to right shunting through the PDA results in increased pulmonary blood flow and steal from the systemic circulation. These haemodynamic changes may be responsible for the co-morbid conditions associated with a PDA: prolonged ventilator dependence and chronic lung disease (CLD), pulmonary haemorrhage (PH), intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH), necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) and retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). Neonatologists may use a variety of first line strategies to close a PDA in a symptomatic preterm infant, including careful fluid administration, diuretics and prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors (PSI) such as Indomethacin or Ibuprofen. Surgical PDA ligation would usually only be considered when medical treatment had either failed or was contraindicated.

The primary aim of this study was to determine mortality after surgical PDA ligation in three centres in the United Kingdom. Secondary aims were (1) to determine the relationship between prior use of PSI on the timing of surgical ligation, duration of oxygen dependency, chronic lung disease and mortality and (2) to describe the incidence of CLD, IVH, NEC and ROP in this neonatal population.

Epidemiology, symptomatology, and pathophysiology of the PDA

The ductus arteriosus and foramen ovale are essential components of the fetal circulation. During pregnancy, these shunts divert oxygenated blood from the placenta away from the pulmonary circulation towards the systemic circulation (RtL = right-to-left shunt). A normal postnatal transition is characterized by a fall in pulmonary vascular resistance, accompanied by a rise in systemic vascular resistance. These physiological changes lead to a reversal of the shunt through the PDA away from the systemic circulation toward the pulmonary circulation (LtR = left-to-right shunt). In the majority of term infants, the postnatal transition ends with functional closure of the PDA in the first 72 postnatal hours after a process of ductal constriction followed by anatomical remodeling. –

In preterm infants, the ductus arteriosus is at increased risk of patency beyond the first days of life. This is related to the histological immaturity of the PDA. With advancing development in utero, there is progressive intimal thickening with formation of intimal cushions making the PDA more susceptible for degeneration and remodeling. Important risk factors for persistent ongoing patency of the ductus arteriosus are lower gestational age, lack of antenatal steroids, low platelet count in the first days of life, and need for mechanical ventilation. –

Background

In patients with ductal‐dependent pulmonary blood flow, initial palliation includes catheter‐based patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) stent or surgical aortopulmonary shunt (APS). This meta‐analysis aimed to compare outcomes between PDA stent and APS.

Methods and Results

A comprehensive literature search yielded six retrospective observational studies. Pooled adjusted hazard ratios (HR) were included to control for covariates and assess time to event analysis. Of 757 patients, 243 (32.1%) underwent PDA stent and 514 (67.9%) underwent APS. Pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum and expected biventricular repair were more common with PDA stent compared with APS (39.6% versus 21.2%, P < 0.001 and 57.9% versus 46.6%, P = 0.007, respectively). There was no statistically significant difference in mortality between PDA stent and APS (HR, 0.71; [95% CI, 0.26–1.93]; P = 0.50). PDA stent was associated with lower risk of postprocedural complications (odds ratio [OR], 0.45; [95% CI, 0.25–0.81]; P = 0.008), mechanical circulatory support (OR, 0.27; [95% CI, 0.09–0.79]; P = 0.02), and shorter intensive care unit length of stay (−4.03 days; [95% CI, −5.99 to −2.07]; P < 0.001), hospital length of stay (−5.54 days; [95% CI, −9.20 to −1.88]; P = 0.003), and duration of mechanical ventilation (−3.41 days; [95% CI, −5.29 to −1.52]; P < 0.001). There was no difference in pulmonary artery growth or hazard of unplanned reintereventions.

Conclusions

PDA stent has a similar hazard of mortality compared with APS. Benefits to PDA stent include shorter duration of mechanical ventilation, shorter hospital length of stay, and fewer complications. Differences in patient characteristics exist with more patients with pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum and expected biventricular repair undergoing PDA stent.

### Interventions for patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in preterm infants: an overview of cochrane systematic reviews [^1113cPXd]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Description of the condition

The ductus arteriosus is a blood vessel that connects the main pulmonary artery to the proximal descending aorta. It plays an important role in maintaining foetal circulation by allowing a significant proportion of right ventricular output to bypass the pulmonary circulation (Gournay 2011). Following birth, with establishment of respiration and separation of low‐resistance placenta, closure of the ductus arteriosus begins. This closure is triggered by physiological mechanisms, such as increased oxygen tension and decreased circulating prostaglandin (PGE₂) and prostacyclin (PGI₂ (Hundscheid 2019)). Functional closure of the ductus arteriosus occurs over the next 24 to 72 hours in term infants (Benitz 2016). In preterm infants, closure is often delayed, leading to the ductus arteriosus remaining patent beyond the first few days of life. In healthy preterm neonates, born at > 30 weeks' gestation, the patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) closes by day four in 90%, and by day seven in 98% of infants (Clyman 2012). In extremely preterm infants, born at < 24 weeks' gestation, spontaneous PDA closure rates are only about 8% by day four and 13% by day seven (Clyman 2012).

### Early prediction of spontaneous patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) closure and PDA-associated outcomes: a prospective cohort investigation [^11581V3u]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Methods

Research design overview

A number of clinical, echocardiographic, and biomarker variables have known associations with an increased likelihood of either spontaneous PDA closure or PDA-associated morbidity. However, no one has incorporated all reported predictors to develop comprehensive, clinically-focused PDA prediction models. In addition, most prior investigations have been limited by retrospective study designs, with echocardiographic surveillance at the clinician's discretion rather than uniform echocardiogram collection at pre-specified time points. The few prospective studies were limited by exposure measurements at single, early time points, short durations of PDA exposure, and/or small sample sizes. Historically, most PDA investigations have been conducted at sites favoring early, aggressive PDA treatment, thus preventing an unbiased examination of the relationships between early PDA indicators, spontaneous closure, and outcomes following persistent PDA. The proposed research is innovative because we will prospectively collect sequential echocardiographic measures, serum and urine biomarkers, and important clinical risk factors within a cohort of untreated infants with PDA. We will utilize that data to develop robust models to evaluate their combined ability to predict both spontaneous PDA closure timing, and PDA-associated mortality, respiratory, and long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes. This study uses a prospective cohort and a rigorously designed observational study to answer proposed questions that cannot be answered with a randomized trial, but that are crucial to future PDA trial development.

Study subjects

We will recruit a cohort of < 30-weeks gestation preterm infants consecutively enrolled using the following inclusion and exclusion criteria:

Inclusion criteria

Infants born between 23-weeks + 0 days (23 0/7 weeks) and 29 6/7 weeks of gestation, inclusive
Admitted to a study network neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) within 72-hours of birth
PDA noted on initial screening echocardiogram at < 72 postnatal hours

Exclusion criteria

Life-threatening congenital abnormalities including congenital heart disease (other than PDA or small atrial septal defects/patent foramen ovale/muscular ventriculoseptal defects)
Infants whose parents have chosen to allow natural death (do not resuscitate order)

### A 43-to 54-year follow-up of 1, 000 patients with congenital heart disease [^111t8W1y]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

From 1952 to 1963, 1,000 consecutive children with congenital heart disease were evaluated by 1 of us (R.C. A.). Current information for 994 patients with 36,086 patient-years is available. Of these, 362 have died, 130 as adults, of whom 67 died from a cardiac cause. Of the remaining 638 patients, 632 were living, and 6 were lost to follow-up. The survival curves for ventricular septal defect, atrial septal defect, patent ductus arteriosus, and pulmonary stenosis paralleled the normal curve. Cyanotic patients had a markedly reduced curve, with 19% alive at 50 years. Most patients were New York Heart Association class I, with only 3 in class IV, each from noncardiac causes. In conclusion, this experience should be helpful to physicians caring for adults with congenital heart disease and provide an optimistic outlook for the patients with less complex conditions.

### Ductus arteriosus and the preterm brain [^1163gEuJ]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2023). Medium credibility.

As the approach to the patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in the preterm infant remains controversial, the potential consequences of a significant ductal shunt on the brain should be evaluated. In this population at high risk of adverse outcomes, including intraventricular haemorrhage and white matter injury, as well as longer-term neurodevelopmental impairment, it is challenging to attribute sequelae to the PDA. Moreover, individual patient characteristics including gestational age and timing of PDA intervention factor into risks of brain injury. Haemodynamic assessment of the ductus combined with bedside neuromonitoring techniques improve our understanding of the role of the PDA in neurological injury. Effects of various PDA management strategies on the brain can similarly be investigated. This review incorporates current understanding of how the PDA impacts the developing brain of preterm infants and examines modalities to measure these effects.

### Patent ductus arteriosus and its treatment as risk factors for neonatal and neurodevelopmental morbidity [^113z5ixv]. Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

The purpose of this work was to determine whether the reported association between neonatal morbidities and a patent ductus arteriosus is because of the left-to-right patent ductus arteriosus shunt itself, the therapies used to treat it, or the immaturity of the infants who are likely to develop a patent ductus arteriosus.

Methods

A total of 446 infants (< 28 weeks' gestation) were treated with the same patent ductus arteriosus care-oriented protocol, and logistic regression analysis was used to examine the effects of several patent ductus arteriosus-related variables (presence of a symptomatic patent ductus arteriosus, the number of indomethacin doses used, the ductus response to indomethacin, and the use of surgical ligation) on the incidence of retinopathy of prematurity, necrotizing enterocolitis, chronic lung disease, death, and neurodevelopmental impairment.

Results

Most of the predictive effects that the presence of a patent ductus arteriosus and its treatment had on neonatal morbidity could be accounted for by the infants' immature gestation. Use of surgical ligation, however, was significantly associated with the development of chronic lung disease and was independent of immature gestation, other patent ductus arteriosus-related variables, or other perinatal and neonatal risk factors known to be associated with chronic lung disease.

Conclusions

These findings add to the growing uncertainty about the benefits and risks of surgical ligation during the neonatal period.

### Outcome following patent ductus arteriosus ligation in premature infants: a retrospective cohort analysis [^1148x9RN]. BMC Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

Background

The patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is an important problem in premature infants. Surgical PDA ligation is usually only be considered when medical treatment has either failed or was contraindicated. The aims of our study were to determine the mortality and morbidity following patent ductus arteriosus ligation in premature infants, and whether prostaglandin synthetase inhibitor (PSI) use prior to ligation affects outcome.

Methods

A retrospective case note review study to determine the outcome of premature infants undergoing patent ductus arteriosus ligation in one tertiary neonatal intensive care unit and two paediatric cardiothoracic centres.

Results

We had follow-up data on 87 infants. Cumulative mortality rates at 7 days, 30 days and at hospital discharge were 2%, 8% and 20% respectively. The incidence of chronic lung disease, intraventricular haemorrhage, necrotising enterocolitis and retinopathy of prematurity were 77%, 39%, 26% and 28% respectively. There was no difference in mortality, incidence of chronic lung disease or duration of oxygen dependence between those who had and those who had not received a PSI prior to surgical ligation. In those who had received 2 or more courses of PSI prior to surgical ligation, there was a trend to increase in the duration of oxygen therapy and chronic lung disease, but no difference in mortality.

Conclusion

This study shows that patent ductus arteriosus ligation is a relatively safe procedure (30 day survival 92%) but there is substantial late mortality and a high incidence of morbidity in the survivors. 2 or more courses of PSI prior to surgical ligation trends to increased oxygen dependence and chronic lung disease. This high risk population requires careful follow-up. A definitive prospective cohort study is lacking.

### Percutaneous patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) closure in very preterm infants: feasibility and complications [^114zodmy]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is associated with morbidity 1 and mortality. 2 Closure of the ductus occurs within hours in the majority (> 95%) of term infants (≥ 37 weeks of gestation). 3 In contrast, a persistent PDA, defined as failure of the ductus to close within 72 hours postnatal age, is seen in ≈50% of very preterm infants (born at < 32 weeks of gestation). 2 Although a cause‐and‐effect relationship between PDAs and adverse outcomes has not been established, 4 odds for death are sixfold higher in premature infants with a persistent PDA (failure of spontaneous or pharmacological closure) than with a closed ductus. 5 Moreover, PDAs are considered precursors to respiratory morbidity, including prolonged ventilator dependency. 2, 6

Treatment of PDAs remains a subject of tremendous controversy and debate. 4 General consensus is that a PDA should be closed by 2 years of age to avoid the risks of pulmonary hypertension or bacterial endocarditis, 7 but disagreement remains about the thresholds and strategies for PDA closure among premature infants earlier in life. 8 Until recently, the only alternatives to close a PDA were drug therapy or surgical ligation. However, recent data showing drug therapy and surgical ligation to be independent risk factors for moderate‐to‐severe functional disability, developmental delay, and motor impairment 9 have led healthcare providers to consider alternative strategies of PDA closure.

Catheter‐based closure of the PDA is among the safest of interventional cardiac procedures and is considered the procedure of choice among infants ≥ 4 kg. 10 Although an exact lower weight limit for the safe closure of a PDA has not been established, previous studies have excluded preterm infants < 4 kg or reported no cases of percutaneous PDA closure below this weight threshold. 11, 12, 13, 14 While recent case reports suggest catheter‐based PDA closure is feasible among infants < 4 kg, 15, 16 data on the safety of the procedure, including adverse events beyond the immediate catheterization period (eg, posthospitalization), are lacking. 17 Since very premature infants < 4 kg are more complex and medically fragile than are their more mature counterparts, 18 a separate consideration of the short‐ and long‐term risks and benefits of percutaneous PDA closure in this unique subgroup is needed.

### Impact of palliation strategy on interstage feeding and somatic growth for infants with ductal-dependent pulmonary blood flow: results from the congenital catheterization research collaborative [^113AFVpt]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Infants with congenital heart disease (CHD) face challenges to normal somatic growth and development. 1, 2, 3 Malnutrition and poor weight gain are often multifactorial in cause. 4, 5, 6, 7 Patients with palliated CHD demonstrate substantial variability in growth during the interstage (the time period between initial palliation and definitive repair or subsequent staged palliation). This time period has become a focus of nationwide quality improvement efforts, in part because of a demonstrated capacity to modify growth trajectory with targeted intervention bundles. 8, 9 Optimizing early growth is paramount because poor nutritional status may portend worse clinical outcomes, including mortality. 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 Furthermore, early interstage growth trajectory may impact late growth trajectory following further palliation or definitive repair. 16, 17

In the setting of cyanotic CHD and ductal‐dependent pulmonary blood flow (PBF), infants require early intervention for survival. Initial palliation may be undertaken with either a modified Blalock‐Taussig shunt (BTS) or patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) stent. Recently, it has been demonstrated that initial palliation with PDA stent, compared with BTS, results in comparable‐to‐superior mortality and perioperative morbidity profiles. 18, 19 In patients with cyanotic CHD and ductal‐dependent PBF, the impact of palliation strategy on somatic growth has not been evaluated. Therefore, we sought to assess the impact of management strategy on interstage somatic growth, feeding regimen complexity, and feeding‐related readmissions in infants with ductal‐dependent PBF palliated with either a PDA stent or BTS, adjusted for baseline differences.

Methods

This systematic review and meta‐analysis were performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses statement. The data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request. This systematic review followed a protocol that was developed a priori. We performed a comprehensive search from PubMed and Embase databases. Keywords and detailed vocabulary were used to search for studies that evaluated mortality, procedural outcomes, and postprocedural complications after PDA stent and APS in patients with cyanotic CHD and DDPBF. APS procedures included Blalock‐Taussig‐Thomas shunts and other systemic‐pulmonary artery shunts. Inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) comparative study design between PDA stent and APS, (2) subjects with single ventricle physiology or biventricular CHD (i.e. tetralogy of Fallot) and DDPBF, and (3) at least 10 subjects who had undergone PDA stent. Only studies published between 2005 and 2020 were included.

### Early prediction of spontaneous patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) closure and PDA-associated outcomes: a prospective cohort investigation [^114yAVfq]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Development of Online Clinical Prediction Tool

PDA treatment parameters and frequencies vary markedly between institutions and individual care providers. Over the past decade, the American Academy of Pediatrics has increasingly advocated for a validated PDA-severity grading-system to permit selective treatment of preterm infants with PDA who are most likely to benefit. We will use our final, validated models to create a web-based tool that predicts an infant's unique probability of spontaneous PDA closure, mortality or 36-weeks PMA respiratory support requirement, and 2-year neurodevelopmental impairment.

Statistical analyses

Aim 1: Statistical Methods

Recognizing that some babies may die prior to PDA closure, models considered will accommodate the competing risk of death prior to closure through a subdistribution hazards model of Fine and Gray. In development of a model to establish a rigorous prediction of PDA closure risk, a penalized variable selection method developed for the Fine and Gray framework will be considered in the model development stage (detailed below). As a comparison to these models, not accounting for the potential of competing risks will be explored using the Cox model framework. If catheter-based closure is performed (< 3% of infants within our regional network), we will censor the observed follow-up time at the time of last recorded PDA, and model the impact of recorded duration of PDA exposure (in postnatal weeks).

### Alprostadil [^113CXdK6]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Alprostadil injection, USP is indicated for palliative, not definitive, therapy to temporarily maintain the patency of the ductus arteriosus until corrective or palliative surgery can be performed in neonates who have congenital heart defects and who depend upon the patent ductus for survival. Such congenital heart defects include pulmonary atresia, pulmonary stenosis, tricuspid atresia, tetralogy of Fallot, interruption of the aortic arch, coarctation of the aorta, or transposition of the great vessels with or without other defects.

In infants with restricted pulmonary blood flow, the increase in blood oxygenation is inversely proportional to pretreatment pO2values; that is, patients with low pO2values respond best, and patients with pO2values of 40 torr or more usually have little response.

Alprostadil injection, USP should be administered only by trained personnel in facilities that provide pediatric intensive care.

1989. 03420230062020 To the Editor — The finding by the Birth Defects Monitoring Program of the Centers for Disease Control1 that patent ductus arteriosus was the most common major malformation in minority groups and the second most common in whites deviates greatly from data published previously. Fyler2 found patent ductus arteriosus to be only the sixth most common congenital heart defect; Mitchell et al3 listed patent ductus arteriosus as the third most common heart defect. Both studies reported ventricular septal defects to be two to four times more frequent than patent ductus arteriosus.

Explanation of the discrepancy undoubtedly lies in the probability that in the Birth Defects Monitoring Program study the discharge diagnosis of patent ductus arteriosus was made mostly in premature infants whose ductus remained open in the neonatal period secondary to their immaturity and to metabolic abnormalities accompanying the respiratory distress syndrome.

### Diagnosis… [^112SV29n]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

2 In addition, first-trimester rubella exposure and residence at high altitudes are associated with an increased incidence of patent ductus arteriosus. 4 Other infants at high risk for CHD include those with abnormalities of other systems and those with syndromes related to abnormal karyotypes. 2, 4 If a cardiac malformation is identified, complete evaluation of other systems is warranted. 7 The infant's age at the time a murmur is first heard is also helpful. If a murmur is detected within 24 hours of birth, the risk of CHD is one in 12; in this situation, patent ductus arteriosus is usually the underlying cardiac defect, and it usually closes before the infant is discharged from the hospital. If a murmur is first heard when the infant is six months of age, the chance of CHD is one in seven; at 12 months of age, the risk of CHD is one in 50.

TETRALOGY OF FALLOT Tetralogy of Fallot is the most common CHD seen beyond infancy, with surgical repair usually undertaken when the child reaches three years of age. 10 It consists of a large ventricular septal defect, right outflow tract obstruction, right ventricular hypertrophy and overriding of the aorta. The classic clinical presentation is the "tet spell, " characterized by hyperpnea, irritability, cyanosis and decreased murmur intensity. 10 The aorta and pulmonary arteries are transposed, so that the two circulations are separate and parallel rather than in sequence. Infants with transposition of the great arteries are cyanotic at birth and often have congestive heart failure. Associated defects such as an atrial septal defect or patent ductus arteriosus, which permit the mixing of blood from the two circuits, are necessary for the infant's survival.

Many factors contribute to growth impairment in infants with CHD, including a lower than normal birth weight, increased caloric requirements and the presence of concomitant musculoskeletal, central nervous system, renal or gastrointestinal malformations. Mild gastrointestinal abnormalities, mild steatorrhea and excess protein loss are common in infants with CHD. 11 Up to 30 percent of infants with CHD have features of various genetic syndromes. 11 Some of these syndromes, such as fetal alcohol syndrome, are probably underdiagnosed. Poor nutrition related to anorexia, fatigability, vomiting, fluid restriction and frequent respiratory infections also contributes to growth impairment.

In preterm infants, a left-to-right patent ductus arteriosus shunt can decrease systemic blood pressure; decrease brain, intestine, and kidney blood flows; increase pulmonary blood flow, pressure, and edema; and alter pulmonary mechanics. A PDA is also associated with several serious neonatal morbidities, like pulmonary hemorrhage, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, necrotizing enterocolitis, and neurodevelopmental disabilities. Whether PDA-induced hemodynamic changes contribute to the associated neonatal morbidities and whether early PDA treatment before clinical symptoms develop can improve neonatal outcomes are questions that have confounded neonatologists for the last 50 years.

### About dextro-transposition of the great arteries (D-TGA) [^1145vc6T]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Dextro-Transposition of the Great Arteries or d-TGA is one type of congenital heart defect. Congenital means present at birth.
- This condition occurs when the heart's two main arteries carrying blood out of the heart are switched in position, or "transposed. "
- Surgical repairs for d-TGA are not a cure. People with d-TGA should schedule routine checkups with a heart doctor to stay as healthy as possible. Often, babies with d-TGA have other heart defects, such as a ventricular septal defect or an atrial septal defect. These defects allow blood to mix so that some oxygen-rich blood can be pumped to the rest of the body. The patent ductus arteriosus also allows some oxygen-rich blood to be pumped to the rest of the body. Keep Reading: How the Heart Works. Infants with d-TGA can have a bluish looking skin color because their blood doesn't carry enough oxygen.

This condition is called cyanosis. Infants with d-TGA or other conditions causing cyanosis can have symptoms such as
- Problems breathing
- Pounding heart
- Weak pulse
- Ashen or bluish skin color
- Poor feeding. Risk factors The causes of d-TGA among most babies are unknown. Some babies have heart defects because of changes in their genes or chromosomes. A combination of genes and other risk factors may increase the risk for AVSD. These factors can include things in a mother's environment, what she eats or drinks, or the medications she uses during pregnancy. Diagnosis d-TGA may be diagnosed during pregnancy or soon after the baby is born. During pregnancy During pregnancy, screening tests check for birth defects and other conditions. An ultrasound, a tool that creates pictures of the baby, may detect d-TGA. If the health care provider suspects d-TGA from the ultrasound, they can request a fetal echocardiogram to confirm the diagnosis.

A fetal echocardiogram is a more detailed ultrasound of the baby's heart. This test can show problems with
- The structure of the heart
- The major blood vessels
- How the heart is working with this defect.

### About hypoplastic left heart syndrome… [^115B1kx2]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Hypoplastic left heart syndrome or HLHS is one type of congenital heart defect.
- Congenital means present at birth.
- HLHS prevents normal blood flow through the heart.
- Surgical repairs for HLHS are not a cure.
- People with this condition should schedule routine checkups with a heart doctor to stay as healthy as possible. What it is HLHS occurs when the left side of the heart does not form correctly during pregnancy. HLHS affects normal blood flow through the heart. A baby born with HLHS will need surgery soon after birth. HLHS is considered a critical congenital heart defect.

What is affected HLHS affects a number of structures on the left side of the heart that do not fully develop:

- The left ventricle is underdeveloped and too small
- The mitral valve is not formed or is very small
- The aortic valve is not formed or is very small
- The ascending portion of the aorta is underdeveloped or is too small Often, babies with HLHS also have an atrial septal defect, a hole between the upper chambers of the heart. How it works During pregnancy, a fetus has two small openings between the left and right sides of the heart. These openings are called the patent ductus arteriosus and the foramen ovale. These openings in the heart usually close a few days after birth. In babies with HLHS, the left side of the heart cannot pump oxygen-rich blood to the body properly. Oxygen-rich blood bypasses the left side of the heart through the patent ductus arteriosus and the foramen ovale. This issue occurs during the first few days of life.

The right side of the heart then pumps blood to both the lungs and the rest of the body. When these openings close, it is harder for oxygen-rich blood to get to the rest of the body. Keep Reading: How the Heart Works. Risk factors The causes of HLHS among most babies are unknown. Some babies have heart defects because of changes in their genes or chromosomes. A combination of genes and other risk factors may increase the risk for HLHS. These factors can include things in a mother's environment, what she eats or drinks, or the medicines she uses.
