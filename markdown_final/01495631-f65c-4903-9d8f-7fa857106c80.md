## Question

Low level of erythrocytes and hemoglobin high levwl of platelets and ESR

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to interpret and manage a patient with low erythrocytes, low hemoglobin, high platelets, and high ESR. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what the CBC pattern signifies pathophysiologically. Then, I should verify the most likely etiologies, especially inflammatory bowel disease and other chronic inflammatory states. Next, I will review the differential diagnosis and exclude primary hematologic disorders. After that, I need to outline a targeted diagnostic workup, including iron studies and inflammatory markers. Finally, I will consider initial management, monitoring, and when to escalate to hematology or gastroenterology, making sure I double-check where ESR and CRP can mislead and how to avoid premature closure.

> Let me first confirm the pattern: low erythrocytes and low hemoglobin indicate anemia, while an elevated platelet count is thrombocytosis and a high ESR reflects systemic inflammation. Together, this triad of anemia, thrombocytosis, and elevated ESR is classic for anemia of chronic inflammation with a reactive platelet increase, and I should be cautious not to over-interpret ESR in isolation because it is nonspecific and influenced by many factors including anemia itself [^113YDzhm] [^116a3D6m].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify the most likely etiologies. Inflammatory bowel disease frequently presents with anemia and thrombocytosis, and both adult and pediatric guidelines emphasize that anemia and elevated platelets are among the most common CBC abnormalities in Crohn's disease, with ESR and CRP variably elevated and not universally discriminative, so normal values do not exclude IBD activity [^114khZJE] [^1131NEtE] [^11574pZT]. I need to ensure I consider other chronic inflammatory states too, such as vasculitis, chronic infections, and malignancy, which can produce the same triad via cytokine-driven hepcidin elevation and thrombopoietin effects [^113YDzhm] [^112ekgeq].

> Wait, let me verify the differential before anchoring on IBD. Primary clonal thrombocytosis, such as essential thrombocythemia, remains on the list, but in the presence of anemia and high ESR, reactive thrombocytosis from inflammation or infection is far more likely; I should confirm this with iron studies, inflammatory markers, and, if needed, JAK2/CALR/MPL testing after excluding secondary causes rather than ordering a bone marrow biopsy reflexively [^115dVSvN] [^117FrQx7]. I should also double-check for myelodysplastic syndromes if macrocytosis, dysplasia, or cytopenias are present, and remember that MDS can occasionally show thrombocytosis in overlap syndromes, which would redirect me to marrow evaluation if suspected [^114EUrzm].

> Next, I should review the targeted diagnostic workup. I will now examine iron indices carefully because distinguishing absolute iron deficiency from anemia of chronic disease is pivotal: ferritin is acute-phase and may be normal or high in inflammation, so transferrin saturation and, where available, reticulocyte hemoglobin or soluble transferrin receptor help; in IBD, ferritin between 30–100 µg/L often reflects mixed iron deficiency plus anemia of inflammation, and a therapeutic iron trial can be diagnostic if hemoglobin rises by at least 10 g/L in 2 weeks [^112qcPhA] [^115wbRKn] [^114J4SK1]. I should confirm inflammatory activity with CRP alongside ESR, since CRP is more dynamic and less confounded by anemia, and I need to check a peripheral smear for microcytosis, anisocytosis, or dysplasia, plus reticulocyte count to assess marrow response, because a low reticulocyte count supports suppressed erythropoiesis in anemia of inflammation [^114khZJE] [^116a3D6m] [^114AKt1p].

> But wait, what if the clinical context suggests gastrointestinal blood loss or malabsorption? I should confirm fecal calprotectin when available to screen for intestinal inflammation, and in suspected IBD flares I must exclude infectious mimics such as C. difficile and CMV before escalating immunosuppression; stool testing for occult blood and targeted endoscopic evaluation are appropriate if iron deficiency is confirmed or symptoms point to a source of bleeding [^117NmNr4] [^113DECq2]. If systemic features raise concern for vasculitis or other multiorgan inflammatory disease, urinalysis, renal function, and directed serologies should be obtained in consultation with rheumatology [^113YDzhm].

> I need to ensure the management plan aligns with the likely diagnosis. If anemia of chronic inflammation with or without iron deficiency is established, treat the underlying inflammatory disease while correcting iron deficiency. Oral iron is reasonable if inflammation is modest and adherence likely, but intravenous iron is preferred in active IBD, severe inflammation, or when oral therapy fails, and I should monitor hemoglobin and platelets to track response as inflammation control often normalizes platelet counts [^112qcPhA] [^112Vtput]. Let me reconsider thrombocytosis management: in reactive thrombocytosis, antiplatelet therapy is generally not indicated unless there is another indication, whereas in clonal ET, cytoreduction is guided by risk stratification; I should confirm the etiology before committing to long-term antiplatelet or cytoreductive strategies [^115eWYnV].

> Hold on, I should verify monitoring cadence and thresholds. I will track hemoglobin, MCV, RDW, reticulocyte parameters, CRP, and platelets every 2–4 weeks initially to confirm trajectory, then space out as stable; a falling platelet count and rising hemoglobin with controlled CRP support effective treatment of the inflammatory driver, while persistent thrombocytosis despite clinical improvement should prompt me to re-evaluate for an occult source of inflammation or, rarely, an emerging myeloproliferative process [^114J4SK1]. If anemia fails to respond to appropriate iron repletion and disease control, I should double-check for alternative or additional causes such as B12/folate deficiency, hemolysis, renal disease, or medication effects before escalating to marrow studies [^114kG2YY].

> I should confirm when to involve specialists. Early gastroenterology input is warranted if IBD is suspected or if endoscopic evaluation is needed for occult bleeding or malabsorption, and hematology consultation is appropriate if thrombocytosis exceeds 1,500 × 10⁹/L, if cytopenias or dysplasia suggest MDS, or if clonal etiologies remain a concern after secondary causes are excluded. Rheumatology should be engaged if vasculitis or other systemic autoimmune disease is on the table [^115eWYnV] [^114EUrzm] [^113YDzhm]. Let me first confirm that I am not over-ordering ESR in isolation. Pairing ESR with CRP improves interpretability, but both are nonspecific, so clinical correlation and judicious use are key to avoid unnecessary testing and delays [^115GBasg] [^115DPZX9].

> In summary, I should double-check that this triad most likely reflects anemia of chronic inflammation with reactive thrombocytosis, commonly due to IBD or another chronic inflammatory condition. A structured workup with iron studies, CRP, reticulocyte parameters, and targeted infection and endoscopic evaluations, followed by treatment of the underlying disease and appropriate iron repletion, will clarify the diagnosis and guide management while minimizing unnecessary invasive testing [^114khZJE] [^112qcPhA] [^117NmNr4].

The combination of **low erythrocytes and hemoglobin** with **high platelets and ESR** most often reflects **anemia of chronic disease** (ACD) with reactive thrombocytosis and elevated inflammatory markers [^117Bn4Sx] [^114qxXds]. This pattern is common in chronic inflammatory or infectious conditions such as IBD [^114khZJE], rheumatoid arthritis, tuberculosis, or malignancy [^112ekgeq]. The anemia is typically **normocytic or mildly microcytic** due to inflammatory hepcidin-driven iron restriction [^117Bn4Sx], while thrombocytosis and ESR elevation are nonspecific responses to inflammation [^114qxXds]. Evaluate with iron studies, CRP, renal and liver function, and targeted imaging or specialty referral to identify and treat the underlying cause [^112qcPhA] [^112FQ7yj].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms

### Anemia of chronic disease (ACD)

- **Hepcidin elevation**: Inflammation increases hepcidin, which inhibits iron release from stores and absorption, causing functional iron deficiency and anemia [^112ekgeq].

- **Erythropoietin suppression**: Cytokines (e.g. IL-1, TNF-α) blunt erythropoietin production and erythroid proliferation, worsening anemia [^114nectP].

- **Shortened RBC lifespan**: Inflammation accelerates RBC clearance, further lowering hemoglobin [^114nectP].

---

### Reactive thrombocytosis

Reactive thrombocytosis arises from **cytokine-driven platelet production** — IL-6 and TPO stimulate megakaryopoiesis in response to inflammation or infection [^notfound]. It is typically **mild to moderate** (platelets 400–800 × 10⁹/L) and resolves with control of the underlying inflammatory driver [^notfound].

---

### Elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)

ESR rises due to **acute-phase proteins** — fibrinogen and other proteins increase in inflammation, promoting rouleaux and faster sedimentation [^notfound]. It is a **nonspecific marker** of inflammation and not diagnostic by itself [^116a3D6m].

---

## Common clinical conditions associated with this pattern

| **Clinical condition** | **Mechanism** | **Associated features** |
|-|-|-|
| Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) | Chronic inflammation causing ACD and reactive thrombocytosis | - Diarrhea <br/> - Weight loss <br/> - Abdominal pain <br/> - Elevated CRP [^114khZJE] [^117NmNr4] |
| Rheumatoid arthritis | Chronic inflammation causing ACD and reactive thrombocytosis | - Joint pain <br/> - Swelling <br/> - Morning stiffness <br/> - Rheumatoid factor [^notfound] |
| Tuberculosis | Chronic infection causing ACD, reactive thrombocytosis, and elevated ESR | - Night sweats <br/> - Weight loss <br/> - Cough <br/> - Fever [^notfound] |
| Malignancy (e.g. lymphoma, solid tumors) | Chronic inflammation and marrow response causing ACD, reactive thrombocytosis, and elevated ESR | - Weight loss <br/> - Night sweats <br/> - Organ-specific symptoms [^notfound] |
| Chronic kidney disease | Reduced erythropoietin causing anemia; inflammation causing thrombocytosis and elevated ESR | - Fatigue <br/> - Edema <br/> - Hypertension <br/> - Elevated creatinine [^notfound] |

---

## Diagnostic approach

### Initial laboratory evaluation

- **Complete blood count (CBC)**: Confirm anemia, thrombocytosis, and assess RBC indices (MCV, MCH, RDW) [^113YDzhm].

- **Iron studies**: Ferritin, transferrin saturation (TSAT), serum iron, total iron-binding capacity (TIBC) to distinguish ACD from iron deficiency anemia [^1171wSFX].

- **Inflammatory markers**: CRP to corroborate inflammation; ESR alone is nonspecific [^114khZJE].

- **Renal and liver function tests**: Evaluate for organ dysfunction contributing to anemia or thrombocytosis [^114EUrzm].

---

### Further investigations

Further investigations should be guided by clinical suspicion: **autoimmune serology** (ANA, rheumatoid factor, ANCA) if autoimmune disease is suspected [^113YDzhm], and **infectious disease screening** (HIV, hepatitis B/C, tuberculosis) if infection is possible [^112FQ7yj]. Imaging (chest X-ray, abdominal ultrasound, CT) is indicated when malignancy or organ-specific disease is suspected [^114rkC3H].

---

## Clinical implications and management

### Clinical implications

This constellation signals **significant underlying disease** — chronic inflammation, infection, or malignancy — and carries increased morbidity, including fatigue, impaired quality of life, and higher cardiovascular risk [^1149vZHG] [^114qxXds].

---

### Management strategies

Management focuses on **treating the underlying cause** — controlling inflammation, infection, or malignancy to improve anemia and thrombocytosis [^112ekgeq]. Supportive care includes **iron therapy** (IV preferred in inflammatory states) [^112Vtput], erythropoiesis-stimulating agents for persistent anemia, and antiplatelet therapy only if thrombocytosis-related thrombosis occurs [^112ekgeq]. Monitor hemoglobin, platelets, and inflammatory markers to track response and detect complications [^113jDSob] [^114khZJE].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis depends on the **underlying condition** and the effectiveness of therapy; persistent anemia and thrombocytosis indicate ongoing inflammation and higher complication risk, whereas correction of these abnormalities reflects disease control and improved outcomes [^112ekgeq] [^114M6UDR].

---

The combination of low erythrocytes and hemoglobin with high platelets and ESR most often reflects **anemia of chronic disease with reactive thrombocytosis** due to inflammation or infection. A structured workup — iron studies, CRP, organ function tests, and targeted imaging — identifies the cause, and management centers on treating the underlying disease while providing supportive care.

### Anemia in children with inflammatory bowel disease: a position paper by the IBD committee of the north American society of pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology and nutrition [^11182Eee]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2020). High credibility.

Risk factors and clinical relevance of anemia in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease include markers of inflammation, nutritional status, disease extent, and sex, and anemia may reflect disease activity. Low albumin, high C reactive protein (CRP) or erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) values, low body mass index (BMI), acute onset with severe disease at presentation, and extensive colitis in children were most significant, and severe anemia was more common in girls while gender differences were not seen with mild anemia. Additional risk factors included diagnosis of CD versus UC, extensive disease in UC, or colonic CD at diagnosis. Anemia and iron deficiency can serve as objective measures of underlying disease activity in IBD and may be the only signs of ongoing active disease, and persistent or recurrent anemia may also be associated with a more severe phenotype.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for anemia of chronic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to initial evaluation, UKKA 2025 guidelines recommend to obtain the following tests in the laboratory evaluation of patients with anemia associated with CKD:

- CBC (including MCH, MCV, platelet count) in addition to the hemoglobin concentration

- absolute reticulocyte count to assess bone marrow responsiveness (if indicated)

- assessment of iron status (percentage of hypochromic RBCs, but only if processing of blood sample is possible within 6 hours, or reticulocyte hemoglobin count or equivalent tests such as reticulocyte hemoglobin equivalent, or combination of transferrin saturation and serum ferritin if the previous tests are not available or the patient has thalassemia or thalassemia trait)

- serum ferritin to assess iron stores

- serum CRP to assess possible inflammation.

Laboratory markers

There are currently no specific routine serological markers to definitively diagnose GCA. Commonly performed blood tests to identify an inflammatory state include CRP; erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) or plasma viscosity (PV); and platelet count. None are specific, however used in combination they may provide more diagnostic certainty in combination with the clinical findings, vascular imaging, or TAB. The difficulty is that most inflammatory and infective aetiologies share a similar biochemical profile (Table 1). In clinical practice certain tests may not be available in the local laboratory. For example, some labs have chosen not to perform ESR and instead offer plasma viscosity as it is not affected by haematocrit variations (e.g. anaemia or polycythaemia) nor affected by a delay in analysis. The challenge here is familiarity as most publications have evaluated ESR and not PV for the diagnosis of GCA. Another diagnostic dilemma is that the ESR and CRP values have been documented as normal in people with GCA. A thrombocytosis > 400,000/μL has shown to be beneficial at predicting a positive biopsy result. Hence, the combination of ESR, CRP, and platelet count has been recommended to provide most useful biochemical information to predict GCA probability.

### Septic arthritis in immunosuppressed patients: Do laboratory values help? [^117HnvGm]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

There are approximately 20,000 cases of septic arthritis diagnosed annually in the United States. It is a diagnosis that can be associated with notable morbidity, including joint destruction, sepsis, and even increased mortality, made worse by a delay in treatment. Prompt diagnosis therefore becomes critical for reducing complications. Accurate diagnosis, however, may be challenging because several pathologies such as crystalline arthropathies or inflammatory arthropathies may present with a similar clinical picture.

Septic arthritis has historically been diagnosed by combining clinical examination and laboratory data, with a positive culture remaining the benchmark for diagnosis. Waiting for the culture results however may require several days, which can lead to increased morbidity. Clinicians must therefore rely on testing that is obtained more rapidly but may not be specific for septic arthritis. Historically, these tests have included a complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), synovial fluid cell count, and percent of synovial fluid neutrophils (% neutrophils). Previous studies have suggested the use of a synovial fluid cell count of > 50,000 cells/mm⁻³ from a native joint aspiration as the threshold for the diagnosis of septic arthritis. The addition of serum white blood cells (WBC) > 11.0 × 10⁹/L and ESR > 30 mm/hr with this synovial fluid cell count threshold has been reported to have a sensitivity approaching 100%.

Despite the near-dogmatic approach to the 50,000 cell cutoff, the evidence to support this value is limited. In addition, it is unknown if patients in an immunosuppressed state can mount an effective immune response to trigger this cutoff or if a lower value should be used for these patients to avoid a delayed or missed diagnosis. The purpose of this study was to review our immunosuppressed patients who had a diagnosis of septic arthritis to determine whether 50,000 cells/mm −3 is a reliable cutoff for this patient population.

### The acute hemolytic anemias: the importance of emergency diagnosis and management [^113edu4K]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Hemolytic anemias are defined by the premature destruction of red blood cells. These anemias have many causes that are mostly due to chronic diseases, but, occasionally, cases of acute life-threatening hemolysis can occur.

Objective

The objectives of this article were to review the pathophysiology of hemolytic anemias, to discuss the general emergency department (ED) evaluation, and to discuss the assessment and treatment of important and "cannot miss" hemolytic diseases.

Discussion

Because hemolytic anemias are rarely seen, the emergency physician may consider a patient's anemia as due to blood loss rather than hemolysis, and the workup and treatment may not be appropriate. The primary goal for the emergency provider is to resuscitate, but he or she also must recognize that a hemolytic process is present. Appropriate laboratory work and specialist consultation should be obtained. While focused treatment is rarely necessary in the ED, the avoidance of certain treatments, such as early platelet transfusion in thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, may be necessary.

Conclusions

Hemolytic anemias are rare, but should still be considered in the ED differential diagnosis of low hemoglobin. Emergency physicians should first resuscitate, but should also be able to identify the presence of hemolysis and obtain the appropriate laboratory tests. Occasionally, specific treatments are needed but should be discussed in conjunction with a specialist.

### ACG clinical guideline: management of Crohn's disease in adults [^114khZJE]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Crohn's disease — laboratory markers in suspected disease: Anemia and an elevated platelet count are the most common changes seen in the complete blood count; C-reactive protein is elevated in a subset of patients with a short half-life of 19 hours, making CRP a useful marker to detect and monitor inflammation; erythrocyte sedimentation rate may be useful in an individual patient, but it is not predictive of IBD and does not discriminate patients with IBD from those with IBS in healthy controls; up to 40% of patients with IBD with mild inflammation may have a normal CRP and ESR, limiting the usefulness of these markers in monitoring some patients.

### Don't miss the diagnosis of sepsis! [^116TQP8o]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Sepsis is amongst the most common reasons for admission to ICUs throughout the world. The early detection and timely administration of appropriate antibiotics are the most important factors in improving the outcome of patients with sepsis. However, the initial signs and symptoms of sepsis are frequently non-specific, leading to a delay in diagnosis. Furthermore, the diagnostic characteristics of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) are not useful in distinguishing infectious from non-infectious causes of SIRS. An elevated white blood count, neutrophilia or eosinopenia are frequently used to diagnose bacterial sepsis; however, these variables have low diagnostic value.

### Prolonged febrile illness and fever of unknown origin in adults [^114rkC3H]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Fever of unknown origin has been described as a febrile illness (temperature of 101°F [38.3°C] or higher) for three weeks or longer without an etiology despite a one-week inpatient evaluation. A more recent qualitative definition requires only a reasonable diagnostic evaluation. Although there are more than 200 diseases in the differential diagnosis, most cases in adults are limited to several dozen possible causes. Fever of unknown origin is more often an atypical presentation of a common disease rather than an unusual disease. The most common subgroups in the differential are infection, malignancy, noninfectious inflammatory diseases, and miscellaneous. Clinicians should perform a comprehensive history and examination to look for potentially diagnostic clues to guide the initial evaluation. If there are no potentially diagnostic clues, the patient should undergo a minimum diagnostic workup, including a complete blood count, chest radiography, urinalysis and culture, electrolyte panel, liver enzymes, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and C-reactive protein level testing. Further testing should include blood cultures, lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase, rheumatoid factor, and antinuclear antibodies. Human immunodeficiency virus and appropriate region-specific serologic testing (e.g., cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, tuberculosis) and abdominal and pelvic ultrasonography or computed tomography are commonly performed. If the diagnosis remains elusive, 18F fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography plus computed tomography may help guide the clinician toward tissue biopsy. Empiric antibiotics or steroids are generally discouraged in patients with fever of unknown origin.

### Iron deficiency across chronic inflammatory conditions: international expert opinion on definition, diagnosis, and management [^1149vZHG]. American Journal of Hematology (2017). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency, even in the absence of anemia, can be debilitating, and exacerbate any underlying chronic disease, leading to increased morbidity and mortality. Iron deficiency is frequently concomitant with chronic inflammatory disease; however, iron deficiency treatment is often overlooked, partially due to the heterogeneity among clinical practice guidelines. In the absence of consistent guidance across chronic heart failure, chronic kidney disease and inflammatory bowel disease, we provide practical recommendations for iron deficiency to treating physicians: definition, diagnosis, and disease-specific diagnostic algorithms. These recommendations should facilitate appropriate diagnosis and treatment of iron deficiency to improve quality of life and clinical outcomes.

### Cervical epidural abscess associated with massively elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate [^117RY11x]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

We present a case of an elderly woman who presented with neck pain, low-grade fever, bandemia, and a massively elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) who had a cervical epidural abscess. We believe that the selective use of ESR assisted in narrowing the differential diagnosis, as the patient had no neurological deficits and no predisposing factors such as distal infection, immunosuppression, trauma, or recent surgery. Furthermore, in the literature, an elevated ESR is consistently found in patients with epidural abscesses, whereas clinical findings such as fever, leukocytosis, and neurological deficits are only variably present.

### What are the optimal cutoff values for ESR and CRP to diagnose osteomyelitis in patients with diabetes-related foot infections? [^1167ktyN]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Distinguishing osteomyelitis from soft-tissue infection of the foot is important because osteomyelitis is associated with more operations, amputation, and prolonged antibiotic exposure. Both erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) are routinely ordered inflammatory biomarkers for evaluating foot infection. When initial evaluation is inconclusive, advanced imaging is indicated, and high clinical or radiographic suspicion of osteomyelitis may indicate bone biopsy to identify organisms and antibiotic sensitivity. Although ESR and CRP levels are helpful for distinguishing osteomyelitis from soft-tissue infections in patients with diabetes-related foot infections, parameters regarding optimal cutoff values for those tests have not, to our knowledge, been defined.

Questions/Purposes

(1) What are the optimal cutoff values for ESR and CRP to differentiate osteomyelitis from soft-tissue infection in patients with diabetes-related foot infection? (2) Can a diagnostic algorithm be derived to guide interpretation of ESR and CRP to improve recognition of osteomyelitis in the setting of diabetic foot infection?

Methods

The medical records of 1842 patients between 18 and 89 years of age treated at our institution between January 1, 2010 and February 6, 2017 for foot infection were reviewed. For inclusion, patients must have had a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, moderate or severe infection, ESR and CRP values within 72 hours of admission, either advanced imaging (MRI or single-positron emission computed tomography/computed tomography [SPECT/CT]) or bone biopsy during admission and must not have had comorbidities that could affect ESR and CRP, such as autoimmune disorders. As such, 1489 patients were excluded, and 353 patients were included in the study. Osteomyelitis was diagnosed by positive bone culture or histopathology. Osteomyelitis was considered to be absent if there was a negative MRI or SPECT/CT result, or negative bone culture and histology findings if imaging was inconclusive. We identified 176 patients with osteomyelitis and 177 with soft-tissue infection. A blinded investigator performed the statistics. Optimal cutoffs of ESR and CRP were determined using receiver operative characteristic (ROC) analysis. A diagnostic algorithm was determined using epidemiologic principles of screening evaluations.

Results

An ESR of 60 mm/h and a CRP level of 7.9 mg/dL were determined to be the optimal cutoff points for predicting osteomyelitis based on results of the ROC analysis. The ESR threshold of 60 mm/h demonstrated a sensitivity of 74% (95% confidence interval [CI] 67–80) and specificity of 56% (95% CI, 48–63) for osteomyelitis, whereas the CRP threshold of 7.9 mg/dL had a sensitivity of 49% (95% CI, 41–57) and specificity of 80% (95% CI, 74–86). If the ESR is < 30 mm/h, the likelihood of osteomyelitis is low. However, if ESR is > 60 mm/h and CRP level is > 7.9 mg/dL, the likelihood of osteomyelitis is high, and treatment of suspected osteomyelitis should be strongly considered.

Conclusions

While ESR is better for ruling out osteomyelitis initially, CRP helps distinguish osteomyelitis from soft-tissue infection in patients with high ESR values. Further prospective studies addressing the prognostic value of ESR and CRP are needed, and a more comprehensive diagnostic algorithm should be developed to include other diagnostic tests such as probe-to-bone and imaging.

### Isolated congenital asplenia: an overlooked cause of thrombocytosis [^111qT6NT]. American Journal of Hematology (2022). Medium credibility.

1 CASE PRESENTATION

We herein report on a 26‐year‐old Caucasian female who was referred to our outpatient clinic with a history of abnormal blood count, including thrombocytosis and monocytosis known for the last 7 years. No family history of hematological disorders was reported. Her past medical history was significant for a papillary thyroid carcinoma that was treated with surgery and radioiodine therapy, obtaining a complete remission; the patient is currently taking levothyroxine. Her physical exam was normal and no signs and/or symptoms of infection were noticed.

Thrombocytosis, defined as a platelet count > 450 × 10⁹/L, is a common finding in routine blood tests and a common cause of referral to hematologists for further investigation. Causes of thrombocytosis can be grouped into primary, secondary, and spurious (Table 1). To find out the etiology of the thrombocytosis, the clinical hematologist should take into consideration data from familial and medical history, physical examination, results of hematological exams, clonal genetic abnormalities and bone marrow aspirate and trephine biopsy for morphological features, flow cytometric data, and cytogenetic and molecular markers of clonality.

TABLE 1
Causes of thrombocytosis

During the visit, we performed additional blood tests. A complete blood count revealed the following values: Hemoglobin 150 g/L, hematocrit 42.8%, mean cell volume 88 fL, white blood cell count 10.23 × 10⁹/L, and platelet count 582 × 10⁹/L. Differential white blood cell count revealed a normal absolute neutrophil count and a slightly increased number of monocytes (1.2 × 10⁹/L). Morphological examination of peripheral blood smear confirmed the higher‐than‐normal platelet count with no significant platelet clumping and also showed several target cells, acanthocytes, and Howell‐Jolly bodies within red blood cells (Figure 1 A). C‐reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) results within the normal range. Serum levels of iron, transferrin, ferritin, and transferrin saturation were normal. Serum level of lactic acid dehydrogenase (LDH) was within the normal range. A chest X‐ray revealed no abnormalities attributable to pulmonary infection. Abdominal ultrasound showed no evidence of infection and reported limited visualization of the spleen. The BCR‐ABL rearrangement was absent in peripheral blood. No mutations of JAK2, CALR, and MPL genes were found in DNA from peripheral blood granulocytes.

### Why does my patient have thrombocytopenia? [^113971re]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Thrombocytopenia, usually defined as a platelet count of less than 150,000/μL, is a common reason for a hematology consult in both the inpatient and outpatient setting. In most patients, the cause of the thrombocytopenia can be identified and treated. This article reviews the clinical approach to the patient with thrombocytopenia, the mechanisms that underlie it, and the laboratory tests available to investigate it. A practical approach to the investigation and management of thrombocytopenia in the clinical settings commonly encountered by the hematology consultant is then described.

### Myeloproliferative disorders [^117MFmef]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

The emergency providers generally encounters myeloproliferative disorders (MPNs) in 1 of 2 ways: as striking laboratory abnormalities of seeming unknown consequence, or in previously diagnosed patients presenting with complications. The course of patients with MPNs is highly variable, but major complications can arise. Emergent conditions related to hyperviscosity need to be recognized early and treated aggressively. Rapid hydration, transfusion, cytoreduction, and early hematology consultation can be lifesaving. Likewise, although management is not altered, a high index of suspicion for thrombotic complications is required in patients with known MPNs as these are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality.

Follow-up and recurrent IDA

12. Hb levels normalise with iron replacement therapy (IRT) in most cases of IDA, but IDA recurs in a minority of these on long-term follow-up (evidence quality — low, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong).

16. We recommend that long-term IRT may be an appropriate strategy when the cause of recurrent IDA is unknown or irreversible (evidence quality — low, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).

23. After the restoration of Hb and iron stores with IRT, we recommend that the blood count should be monitored periodically (perhaps every 6 months initially) to detect recurrent IDA (evidence quality — very low, consensus — 85%, statement strength — strong).

IDA should be treated with IRT as detailed in the Treatment section, and if the initial investigation reveals the cause, it should obviously be addressed as appropriate. However, the majority of individuals presenting with unexplained IDA will have negative BDE, no evidence of CD, no other symptoms, and a complete and sustained haematological response to IRT. In this situation, the outlook is generally favourable, and there is no need for further investigation other than a periodic blood count after completion of IRT to check for recurrent IDA. In an era of limited resources, we would suggest checks at perhaps 3, 6, 12 and 24 months.

Further investigation is however warranted if there is any evidence of active undiagnosed pathology. Pointers to this possibility include symptoms such as ongoing weight loss or chronic unexplained diarrhoea, persistently elevated inflammatory markers and the persistence or recurrence of IDA. Persistent IDA describes the situation where there is haematological evidence of ongoing iron deficiency despite adequate IRT, while in recurrent IDA the haematological abnormalities resulting from iron deficiency resolve with IRT, only to reappear at a later date.

### A practical approach to the evaluation of the anemic child [^116DbepM]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

Anemia is a sign of disease and not a final diagnosis. The clinician's goal is to define the underlying cause. The anemia may be due to decreased production or Increased destruction or loss of red blood cells. Integration of the results of the initial CBC. particularly the RBC indices, the peripheral blood smear, the history and the physical examination can help organize the focus of further evaluations and, ultimately, minimize the number of tests needed to make a firm diagnosis.

3. CRP and ESR should always be performed in patients with suspected prosthetic joint infection. A normal value does not rule out PJI.

Level of evidence: 2.

Patients presenting with clinical signs of prosthetic joint infection (i.e. fever, unexplained pain at the site of arthroplasty, prosthetic loosening, or a sinus tract) should be subjected to screening for inflammatory markers in serum. C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) are good preliminary tests. Screening of these markers can be performed rapidly, inexpensively, and with minimal inconvenience. Although there is considerable variation in sensitivity (SE) and specificity (SP) for both CRP (SE 21–100%, SP 20–96%) and ESR (SE 58–97%, SP 33–90.9%), in general they show good diagnostic value, and are of relevance particularly for therapy follow-up. A threshold of 10 mg/l for CRP and 30 mm/h for ESR of is recommended for diagnostic purposes. One level 1 study and 32 level 2 studies addressed the diagnostic efficacy of CRP and ESR in serum. However, when testing for CRP and ESR, one should keep in mind that both markers can be influenced by numerous factors (i.e. neoplastic and inflammatory conditions, age, and technical details). Furthermore, CRP is produced in the liver, and especially in low-grade chronic PJI, levels may not be elevated. Therefore, a careful history and physical examination are mandatory. Several studies suggest using the combination of ESR and CRP. In any case, if one of these markers is above the threshold, further diagnostic tests should be performed. Low CRP and ESR do not rule out PJI.

### Pancreatic ascites: update on diagnosis and management [^114gS8xu]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis

Pancreatic ascites is a diagnostic challenge because of its rarity and nonspecific clinical features. Therefore, a comprehensive diagnostic approach that incorporates a history of the presenting illness, physical examination, blood tests, imaging, and diagnostic paracentesis with fluid analysis, is crucial. As noted above, the physical findings of ascites may include cachexia, abdominal tenderness, peritonitis, abdominal distension, shifting dullness, positive fluid wave, decreased bowel sounds and extremity edema. Patients with concomitant pleural effusion may exhibit decreased breath sounds, crackles or rales, and in severe cases may be in respiratory distress.

Laboratory tests

Routine blood tests, including a complete metabolic panel, brain natriuretic peptide level, lactic acid, uric acid and complete blood cell count, can help clinicians narrow down the differential diagnosis of new-onset ascites. Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte abnormality observed in pancreatic ascites cases and is likely to be dilutional, due to fluid retention. Hypoalbuminemia is also reported in most cases, and is often secondary to severe malnutrition in the setting of chronic pancreatitis or pancreatic ascites.

On complete blood cell count, patients typically show low hemoglobin with a normal to mildly elevated white blood count, even in the absence of an underlying infection. Platelet count and coagulation factors, such as prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time and international normalized ratio, are usually normal. C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate are typically elevated, especially in patients with chronic pancreatitis. Serum lipase and amylase levels are often normal or mildly elevated in pancreatic ascites, thereby rendering these tests non-diagnostic.

Box 2
First line investigations

First line investigations support a diagnosis of AAV by evaluating for a chronic inflammatory response or renal failure or by testing for differential diagnoses such as infection and cancer. Given the multi-system nature of AAV, and the broad differential diagnosis, it is usually appropriate to request all of these investigations in cases of suspected AAV. The only exception is the ANCA test which would usually be requested by a specialist service.

Urinalysis (consider AAV causing glomerulonephritis if more than a trace of either blood or protein is detected; if abnormal then consider quantifying proteinuria with a urine protein:creatine or albumin:creatine ratio)
Full blood count (normocytic anaemia/thrombocytosis/eosinophilia due to chronic inflammation; microcytic anaemia in chronic covert blood loss in low grade alveolar haemorrhage or gut involvement; rapidly falling haemoglobin in acute alveolar haemorrhage)
Urea and electrolytes (rising serum creatine/falling eGFR)
Serum albumin (may be low due to inflammation or nephrotic range proteinuria)
C reactive protein or erythrocyte sedimentation rate (both measurements are high in inflammation)
Liver function tests, calcium (typically normal or near-normal in AAV, so abnormalities might suggest an alternative diagnosis such as infection or cancer)
Chest radiography (may have nodular, fibrotic, or infiltrative lesions in AAV; exclude lung cancer or infection)
ANCA testing in liaison with specialty service

The second difficult scenario is AAV presenting as organ limited disease, without systemic symptoms. For example, most patients with isolated glomerulonephritis have no symptoms until renal failure advances to the point of uraemia. Thus, consider AAV in patients with falling eGFR with blood and protein on urine dipstick even if they have no constitutional symptoms and full blood count and C reactive protein results are normal.

The differential diagnosis of AAV includes cancer, chronic infection (particularly bacterial endocarditis), and other autoimmune conditions. Because of the difficulties in diagnosis, discuss patients with possible or suspected AAV early with a specialty service.

### Fever of unknown origin in adults [^112FQ7yj]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Fever of unknown origin is defined as a clinically documented temperature of 101°F or higher on several occasions, coupled with an unrevealing diagnostic workup. The differential diagnosis is broad but is typically categorized as infection, malignancy, noninfectious inflammatory disease, or miscellaneous. Most cases in adults occur because of uncommon presentations of common diseases, and up to 75% of cases will resolve spontaneously without reaching a definitive diagnosis. In the absence of localizing signs and symptoms, the workup should begin with a comprehensive history and physical examination to help narrow potential etiologies. Initial testing should include an evaluation for infectious etiologies, malignancies, inflammatory diseases, and miscellaneous causes such as venous thromboembolism and thyroiditis. If erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein levels are elevated and a diagnosis has not been made after initial evaluation, 18F fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography scan, with computed tomography, may be useful in reaching a diagnosis. If noninvasive diagnostic tests are unrevealing, then the invasive test of choice is a tissue biopsy because of the relatively high diagnostic yield. Depending on clinical indications, this may include liver, lymph node, temporal artery, skin, skin-muscle, or bone marrow biopsy. Empiric antimicrobial therapy has not been shown to be effective in the treatment of fever of unknown origin and therefore should be avoided except in patients who are neutropenic, immunocompromised, or critically ill.

### Iron deficiency across chronic inflammatory conditions: international expert opinion on definition, diagnosis, and management [^114G1cVV]. American Journal of Hematology (2017). Low credibility.

1.8 Diagnosis of iron deficiency in chronic inflammatory conditions

Our review of international guidelines available for CHF, CKD and IBD reveals no consensus practical guidance for diagnosing iron deficiency independent of anemia (Table 1). However, only some guidelines recognize iron deficiency as a standalone condition — whether this is through lack of awareness of iron deficiency or an intentional omission is difficult to establish (Table 1). Iron deficiency can be simply diagnosed with routinely available blood tests measuring serum ferritin and transferrin saturation (TSAT). 86 yet guidelines often lack agreement on test cut‐off values for these parameters. 4 Serum ferritin levels are sensitive to inflammation and some guidelines recommend assessment of chronic inflammation (according to inflammatory markers such as C‐reactive protein [CRP] and erythrocyte sedimentation rate); however, there is little consensus for many conditions on when this should be measured, should it be standard practice for all patients or measured only when serum ferritin is > 30 µg L −1 or if patients are symptomatic 68, 87? Moreover, no standard CRP cut‐off values are provided; although a CRP level of 5 mg L⁻¹ is the most common threshold, 64 this is not recognized in most guidelines 68

### Clinical practice guideline by the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (PIDS) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA): 2023 guideline on diagnosis and management of acute bacterial arthritis in pediatrics [^115zmfGm]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2024). High credibility.

Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) in acute bacterial arthritis (ABA) — interpretive value and limitations: The Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) is usually, but not always, elevated in children with ABA at presentation and is usually higher in ABA than in transient nonbacterial synovitis or acute rheumatic fever, but overlap of ESR ranges precludes discriminatory utility, and the ESR often does not normalize until the fourth week after initiation of therapy; therefore, the Guideline Panel does not see value in the routine inclusion of ESR testing in children evaluated for suspected ABA to differentiate bacterial from non-bacterial causes of joint inflammation, the ESR does not substantially assist in pathogen assessment, and it has not been helpful for assessing adjacent musculoskeletal infection to determine need for extended antimicrobial therapy.

### Emergency medicine evaluation and management of anemia [^11693D6F]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Anemia is a common condition and is diagnosed on laboratory assessment. It is defined by abnormally low hemoglobin concentration or decreased red blood cells. Several classification systems exist. Laboratory markers provide important information. Acute anemia presents with symptoms owing to acute blood loss; chronic anemia may present with worsening fatigue, dyspnea, lightheadedness, or chest pain. Specific treatments depend on the underlying anemia and etiology. Iron is an alternative treatment for patients with microcytic anemia owing to iron deficiency. Hyperbaric oxygen is an option for alternative rescue therapy. Most patients with chronic anemia may be discharged with follow-up if hemodynamically stable.

Screening tests and interpretation in IBD-related anemia specify that initially a complete blood count (CBC), CRP, and ferritin levels should be performed, and if anemic, testing should include CBC with differential, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular Hgb concentration (MCHC), red cell distribution width (RDW), reticulocyte count, CRP, serum ferritin, and transferrin saturation (TSAT); in IDA and FID anemia is more likely to be microcytic and hypochromic (low MCV and MCHC) whereas in ACD it is more likely normocytic and normochromic; macrocytosis may be seen with vitamin B12 or folic acid deficiency or drug therapy including sulfasalazine, methotrexate, 6-MP, and azathioprine; a high RDW in the presence of microcytosis suggests iron deficiency and has a high sensitivity of about 93% for the diagnosis of iron deficiency; the reticulocyte count is a useful marker of bone marrow response where a low count indicates suppression of erythropoiesis and a high initial count raises suspicion for hemolysis prompting further evaluation including a peripheral blood cell smear, serum haptoglobin, bilirubin, lactate dehydrogenase, and direct Coomb's test; if the platelet count is high, iron deficiency and/or inflammation is more likely.

Recent history of gastrointestinal or urinary infection, gut inflammation confirmed by elevated fecal calprotectin levels, sacroiliitis with inflammatory spinal changes and enthesitis detected by MRI support diagnosis of ERA. Subclinical gut inflammation has also been identified in older-onset of psoriatic JIA.

The diagnosis of sJIA in accordance with ILAR criteria requires arthritis and fever within the last 2 weeks, and one of the following criteria: rash, generalised lymphadenopathy, enlargement of liver or spleen, or serositis. Common laboratory abnormalities suggestive of systemic inflammation include elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), white blood cell count, platelet count, ferritin, transaminases, aldolase and d-dimers help to define the activity of the disease. Laboratorial analysis of patients with active sJIA may reveal granulocytosis, thrombocytosis, anaemia, upregulation of acute phase reactants (elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP), which are typical findings but not so essential for diagnosis in comparison with the life-threatening complication of MAS that include pancytopaenia, increased levels of ferritin, liver enzymes (aspartate and alanine transaminases), triglycerides, d-Dimers and hypofibrinogenemia. Clinical findings of MAS include high non-remitting fever, generalised lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, central nervous system dysfunction and hemorrhagic manifestations.

Available diagnostic methods for PBI

Clinical assessment, symptoms, and signs of peripheral bone infection

In acute cases, individuals may report a generalized feeling of illness, loss of appetite, fatigue, nausea, and fever. Pain is the most common local symptom, and there may be a reduced ability to use the affected body part. A history of recent trauma, surgery, or infection of another organ (i.e. lungs, bladder) can be present. Individuals with chronic osteomyelitis may have a history of an acute episode. The patient may have an underlying immune system disease or peripheral vascular disease. The patient must be questioned about intravenous drug abuse and alcoholism. A complete medical history should be obtained, including all current and prior illnesses and injuries. On physical examination, there can be clear signs of disease, like a direct fistula to the bone and purulent discharge, but often signs are more subtle like slight erythema and swelling or sub-febrile temperature and diffuse pain. Fever, signs of dehydration or other signs of blood infection (sepsis) may be evident. Range of motion of joints may be reduced. In analogy with ulcers in patients with a diabetic foot pointing to osteomyelitis, ulcers in the tibia often reflect osteomyelitis. Therefore a probe-to-bone test can be helpful in establishing the diagnosis of PBI. In this test, the physician palpates the bone with a metal probe. This simple bedside procedure is based on the concept that if the probe can reach bone, so can infectious bacteria [Lavery 2007].

Value of laboratory parameters

The specificity of elevated laboratory parameters of inflammation (white blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), and procalcitonin) in differentiating PBI from other clinical conditions is low. In adult patients with PBI, ESR and CRP may be elevated, but on the contrary white blood cell counts is often in the normal range. Therefore, these parameters are not able to sufficiently discriminate the presence or absence of infection. However, a sharp increase of ESR and CRP may be helpful in confirming the diagnosis of PBI in the clinical context of a high level of suspicion and may therefore influence the choice of imaging modality to be performed first. Also, serum procalcitonin may be used as a diagnostic marker for PBI. Blood cultures should be performed for both aerobic and anaerobic germs in febrile patients in addition to biopsy, when possible.

### Limited value of elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate as an indicator of malignancy [^117PxHFd]. Family Practice (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) are often suspected of having malignant disease and are subjected to extensive investigations. Thus, the finding of an elevated ESR can result in considerable costs and might even be dangerous for the patient if invasive studies are ordered.

Objectives

Our aims were to establish (i) the prevalence of malignant diseases in hospitalized patients and out-patients with elevated ESR; and (ii) the long-term incidence of malignant diseases in patients during 5 years after unsuccessful investigation for elevated ESR.

Methods

A cross-sectional survey was carried out in 128 patients admitted to the Department of General Internal Medicine, University of Kiel and in 94 out-patients under the care of a GP. A retrospective cohort study of 50 patients was also carried out by contacting GPs of patients discharged from hospital after unsuccessful investigation.

Results

In the hospitalized patients, the ESR was elevated in 53.1% (68/128) and was normal in 46.9% (60/128). Malignancy was found in 25.0% (17/68) of patients with elevated ESR and in 15% (9/60) of patients with normal ESR (P = 0.16). Of the out-patients, 94 patients with elevated ESR were investigated, of whom 8.5% (8/94) had malignancies (P = 0.004 compared with hospitalized patients). In the follow-up study of 50 patients who had been discharged with the diagnosis "elevated ESR of unknown origin", follow-up information was available from 38 individuals. Of these, 71.0% (27/38) had not developed signs or symptoms of any disease at the time of investigation. Malignant disease had developed in only 5.3% (2/38).

Conclusion

The prevalence of malignancy in patients with elevated ESR is low, in both the clinical and the general practice setting. Elevation of ESR is not an early sign of malignant disease and does not justify extensive investigation in a patient who has no symptoms which are suggestive of a tumour.

### How to approach chronic anemia [^116116vp]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2012). Low credibility.

We present herein an approach to diagnosing the cause of chronic anemia based on a patient's history and complete blood cell count (CBC). Four patterns that are encountered frequently in CBCs associated with chronic anemias are considered: (1) anemia with abnormal platelet and/or leukocyte counts, (2) anemia with increased reticulocyte counts, (3) life-long history of chronic anemia, and (4) anemia with inappropriately low reticulocytes. The pathophysiologic bases for some chronic anemias with low reticulocyte production are reviewed in terms of the bone marrow (BM) events that reduce normal rates of erythropoiesis. These events include: apoptosis of erythroid progenitor and precursor cells by intrinsic and extrinsic factors, development of macrocytosis when erythroblast DNA replication is impaired, and development of microcytosis due to heme-regulated eIF2α kinase inhibition of protein synthesis in iron-deficient or thalassemic erythroblasts.

### Pseudothrombocytopenia and other conditions associated with spuriously low platelet counts [^112HTVP5]. Haematologica (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Platelets play an important role in hemostasis, as evidenced by the fact that defects in their number or function are associated with bleeding diatheses. In addition, the platelet count has important implications in the evaluation of patients with a variety of disorders. It is, therefore, extremely important for the treating physician to be able to rely on accurate estimations of the number of circulating platelets. For example, the severity of abnormalities of the platelet count guides decision-making on patients' treatment. Despite greatly improved efficiency and performance with the widespread availability of automated hematology analyzers in routine and specialized laboratories, there are still technical and biological variables that hamper their diagnostic accuracy. This review describes the most common and important conditions that are associated with inaccurate platelet counting resulting in spuriously low platelet counts.

Approach to diagnostic testing when considering

Laboratory testing. Because most patients with vasculitis do not have hematologic malignancy, we do not exhaustively test all patients with a new diagnosis of vasculitis with a bone marrow biopsy and flow cytometry, for example. However, we always consider the presteroid complete blood cell count (CBC) with differential and, if available, the historic CBC with differential trend as a vital piece of diagnostic information to integrate with other diagnostic testing that, from our hematologic evaluation minimally, includes erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C‐reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP), serum‐free light chains (SFLC), cryoglobulins, C3, and C4 (Figure 2).

### Thrombocytosis in the NICU [^114qxXds]. Neurocritical Care (2008). Low credibility.

An elevated platelet count may occur during care of neurology/neurosurgical patients and is usually due to reactive or secondary thrombocytosis (ST) caused by inflammation or infection. Primary (clonal) thrombocythemia or essential thrombocythemia associated with myeloproliferative disorders is usually known before or during early patient assessment. Rarely, paraneoplastic causes of thrombocytosis may be discovered. Although no single test differentiates primary from secondary etiologies, laboratory tests that show increased acute phase responses, such as C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and interleukin-6, may be useful in diagnosing ST. Thrombosis due to ST is rare in any platelet count. ST, however, should be considered within the overall risk assessment for thromboembolism in any patient. If treatment is initiated, low-dose aspirin is sufficient.

Acutely, he developed 5 days of fever as high as 39.4°C. He had a remote travel history to the Middle East. On physical examination, he was febrile and tachycardic, was thin but otherwise had a normal examination. His inflammatory markers were elevated: erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 93 mm/hour and his C-reactive protein was 25.4 mg/L. A complete blood count revealed a white blood cell count of 17,000 × 10³/µL with increased bands. His hemoglobin level was 8.8 g/dL with a mean corpuscular volume of 81 fl. Platelets were 556 × 10³/µL. A chest radiograph was concerning for a cavitary lung lesion and an abdominal ultrasound revealed multiple hypoechoic lesions in his spleen.

Child with suspected Cushing syndrome — laboratory evaluation includes an overnight dexamethasone suppression test in which a single dose of 1 mg of dexamethasone given close to 11 pm should suppress the AM cortisol to < 1.8 ug/dl (50 nmol/L), and a midnight salivary cortisol that is a good screening test to rule out Cushings. Additional laboratory testing lists low and high dose dexamethasone suppression test, a corticotrophin releasing hormone test, and a complete metabolic panel, complete blood count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), plus vitamin D levels, calcium and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels; blood glucose can be elevated with possible glycosuria, frank diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance can develop in children with hypercortilism, hematological and immune dysfunction with cortisol stimulating erythropoiesis leading to polycythemia, lymphopenia and eosinopenia are common, and as cortisol affects vitamin D absorption in the intestines and increased loss of calcium from the kidneys there is often osteopenia/osteoporosis.

### Recommendations from the international consensus conference on anemia management in surgical patients (ICCAMS) [^1171wSFX]. Annals of Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Consensus Statements: Diagnosis

All patients with anemia should be evaluated for the cause of anemia — wherever possible, early enough preoperatively to enable sufficient time for treatment to be successful.
It is important to identify iron deficiency, including in patients with anemia of inflammation (or anemia of chronic disease).
Patients with IDA should be evaluated for the cause of the iron deficiency, whereas patients with anemia and normal iron studies should be evaluated for coexisting causes of anemia (ie, renal disease, primary hematologic disease, and nutrition deficiency).
Evaluation for iron deficiency should include iron studies (serum iron, total iron binding capacity, transferrin saturation (TSAT), serum ferritin); if available, reticulocyte Hb content and/or serum hepcidin should be considered in inflammatory states.
The most important criteria for defining absolute iron deficiency were ferritin < 30 ng/mL and/or TSAT < 20%; ferritin < 100 ng/mL may define iron deficiency in inflammatory states. If available, either a reticulocyte Hb < 29 pg or a serum hepcidin level < 20 µg/L also suggest the presence of iron deficiency in inflammatory states.

Supporting Evidence: Diagnosis

In a study of 3342 patients undergoing major elective surgery, the overall prevalence of anemia was 36%. Of the patients with anemia, 62% had absolute iron deficiency and another 5% had low iron stores. Therefore, all patients with anemia should be screened for iron deficiency. In some circumstances (eg, planned surgery associated with large blood loss), it may also be appropriate to evaluate nonanemic surgical patients for iron deficiency. Patients with anemia who are not iron deficient should be evaluated for other causes of anemia (eg, renal disease, primary hematologic disease, nutritional deficiencies). Determination of whether anemia is microcytic, normocytic, or macrocytic (in patients with reticulocyte production index < 2) may help identify likely causes. Wherever possible, evaluations should be performed early enough preoperatively to enable sufficient time for treatment to be successful. In patients undergoing urgent/emergency procedures, blood samples for evaluation and classification of anemia should be drawn preoperatively, with the aim of testing promptly (preoperatively if possible).

### Cryptogenic and secondary organizing pneumonia: clinical presentation, radiographic findings, treatment response, and prognosis [^111ifCuw]. Chest (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Organizing pneumonia (OP) is a distinct clinical and pathologic entity. This condition can be cryptogenic (COP) or secondary to other known causes (secondary OP). In the present study, we reviewed the features associated with COP and secondary OP in patients from two teaching hospitals.

Methods

The medical records of 61 patients with biopsy-proven OP were retrospectively reviewed. Forty patients were diagnosed with COP and 21 patients with secondary OP. The clinical presentation, radiographic studies, pulmonary function tests (PFTs), laboratory data, BAL findings, treatment, and outcome were analyzed.

Results

The mean age at presentation was 60.46 ± 13.57 years. Malaise, cough, fever, dyspnea, bilateral alveolar infiltrates, and a restrictive pattern were the most common symptoms and findings. BAL lymphocytosis was observed in 43.8% of patients with OP. The relapse rate and mortality rate after 1 year of follow-up were 37.8% and 9.4%, respectively. The in-hospital mortality was 5.7%. The clinical presentation and radiographic findings did not differ significantly between patients with COP and secondary OP. A mixed PFT pattern (obstructive and restrictive physiology) and lower blood levels of serum sodium, serum potassium, platelets, albumin, protein, and pH were observed among patients with secondary OP. Higher blood levels of creatinine, bilirubin, Paco₂, and BAL lymphocytes were also more common among patients with secondary OP. There were no differences in the relapse rate or mortality between patients with COP and secondary OP. The 1-year mortality correlated with an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, low albumin, and low hemoglobin levels.

Conclusions

The clinical and radiographic findings in patients with COP and secondary OP are similar and nonspecific. Although certain laboratory abnormalities are more common in secondary OP and can be associated with worse prognosis, they are likely due to the underlying disease. COP and secondary OP have similar treatment response, relapse rates, and mortality.

### Simultaneous testing of erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein: increased expenditure without demonstrable benefit [^116LpFSv]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

We analyzed the practice of paired erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein testing when evaluating fever or inflammation. In our hospital, this resulted in additional charges of $250000-$400000/year without demonstrable added benefit to patient care. Extrapolating our results, we estimate reducing this practice could save up to $300000000 nationally.

### Why is my patient anemic? [^114FcXEi]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Anemia is a decreased number of circulating red blood cells and is a common medical condition faced in clinical practice. Anemia is caused by loss of red blood cells, destruction of red blood cells, decreased production of red blood cells, or a combination of these processes. Through a clinical history, physical examination, and laboratory evaluation the provider must identify the process by which the patient is anemic. Often the cause of anemia is straightforward; however, the cause can be challenging, requiring a thorough knowledge of both hematology and general medicine.

### Evaluation of fever in the emergency department [^115TbfrE]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Fever is one of the most common complaints in the emergency department (ED) and is more complex than generally appreciated. The broad differential diagnosis of fever includes numerous infectious and non-infectious etiologies. An essential skill in emergency medicine is recognizing the pitfalls in fever evaluation.

Objective Of Review

This review provides an overview of the complaint of fever in the ED to assist the emergency physician with a structured approach to evaluation.

Discussion

Fever can be due to infectious or non-infectious etiology and results from the body's natural response to a pyrogen. Adjunctive testing including C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and procalcitonin has been evaluated in the literature, but these tests do not have the needed sensitivity and specificity to definitively rule in a bacterial cause of fever. Blood cultures should be obtained in septic shock or if the results will change clinical management. Fever may not be always present in true infection, especially in elderly and immunocompromised patients. Oral temperatures suffer from poor sensitivity to diagnose fever, and core temperatures should be utilized if concern for fever is present. Consideration of non-infectious causes of elevated temperature is needed based on the clinical situation.

Conclusion

Any fever evaluation must rigorously maintain a broad differential to avoid pitfalls that can have patient care consequences. Fever is complex and due to a variety of etiologies. An understanding of the pathophysiology, causes, and assessment is important for emergency physicians.

### Diagnosis and management of iron deficiency in chronic inflammatory conditions (CIC): is too little iron making your patient sick? [^112Vtput]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2020). Medium credibility.

While iron deficiency remains the most common cause of anemia worldwide, low iron stores are associated with symptoms regardless of the presence of typical microcytic, hypochromic anemia and may be hard to recognize in patients with concurrent inflammation. Diagnosing and treating iron deficiency become more of a challenge because markers of iron status are influenced by low-grade inflammation present in common conditions, such as chronic kidney disease, cirrhosis, or heart failure. Here I present a pragmatic way of interpreting diagnostic lab tests to help clinicians recognize patients who are most likely to benefit from iron supplementation, choose between oral and parenteral administration, and make personalized decisions when patients do not fit usual guidelines.

### Clinical and laboratory characteristics of patients with atherothrombotic risk factors presenting with low concentrations of highly sensitive C-reactive protein [^115TQAwK]. Atherosclerosis (2004). Low credibility.

Aims

To clarify whether individuals with low concentrations of highly sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) are free of atherothrombotic risk factors or low-grade inflammation.

Methods and Results

This cross-sectional study included 1266 individuals with risk factors (diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, smoking, obesity). Eighty percent of women and the same percentage of men with a low concentration (0.8 ± 0.4 mg/l) of hs-CRP had at least one atherothrombotic risk factor. About one-fourth of the females and a one-third of the males with a low concentration of hs-CRP had at least one laboratory marker of chronic inflammation (erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), white blood cell count (WBCC) or fibrinogen concentration) in the upper 75th percentile.

Conclusion

Individuals presenting with low concentrations of hs-CRP are not necessarily free of atherothrombotic risk factors. One-fourth of the females and a third of the males in this group presented laboratory evidence of a low-grade inflammation as detected by increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate, white blood cell count or fibrinogen concentration.

### Diagnostic approach to the patient with a suspected inherited platelet disorder: who and how to test [^111fhkxR]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). Medium credibility.

Bleeding and thrombocytopenia are common referrals to the pediatric and adult hematology practice. The differential diagnosis encompasses a wide spectrum of entities that vary in acuity, severity, and etiology. Most will be acquired (especially in adult patients), but many can be inherited, and some may have manifestations affecting other organ systems. The first step: defining whether the symptoms and/or laboratory findings are clinically significant and warrant additional work-up, can be equally as challenging as reaching the diagnosis itself. How much bleeding is too much to be considered normal? How low of a platelet count is too low? Once the decision has been made to pursue additional studies, considering the increasing number of laboratory tests available, the diagnostic process can be complex. In this article, we outline a general approach for the evaluation of patients in whom an inherited platelet disorder is being considered. We present two clinical vignettes as introduction to the diagnostic approach to inherited platelet disorders. We describe the rationale for the different types of tests that are clinically available, their limitations, and finally the challenges that are frequently encountered in the interpretation of results. We also intend to provide some guidance on the expected phenotype in terms of severity of bleeding and/or thrombocytopenia according to the etiology of the inherited disorder. Our goal is to provide the practicing hematologist with a practical framework that is clinically applicable in their daily practice.

### IWGDF / IDSA guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of diabetes-related foot infections (IWGDF / IDSA 2023) [^1176f9RM]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2024). High credibility.

Inflammatory biomarkers in diabetes-related foot infection (DFI) — erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), white blood cell (WBC) count, and procalcitonin (PCT) have limited stand‑alone diagnostic performance: a highly elevated ESR (≥ 70 mm/h) shows sensitivity, specificity, and AUC for diagnosing diabetic foot osteomyelitis of 81%, 80%, and 0.84, respectively; available studies found little correlation of WBC with infection severity; CRP levels rise and fall more quickly with infection and resolution, and studies report PCT levels are higher in infected diabetic foot ulcers but with little correlation to severity; because their specificity and sensitivity do not exceed 0.85 when used alone, inflammatory biomarkers should be used when uncertainty persists after clinical assessment, and a Best Practice Statement about the use of ESR, CRP, or PCT is made with low‑certainty evidence.

### Why does my patient have thrombocytosis? [^115dVSvN]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Thrombocytosis is a common clinical problem frequently encountered during routine evaluation. The diagnostic workup entails a step-by-step approach, which allows for an accurate assessment of the underlying cause. A thorough clinical history and physical examination may help differentiate thrombocytosis secondary to a reactive process versus an underlying clonal proliferation process. Once essential thrombocytosis is evident, relevant laboratory evaluation for an ongoing myeloproliferative disorder is paramount. Various treatment modalities have been proven to be beneficial. With further scientific investigation underway, molecular therapies may soon be cornerstones of therapy in essential thrombocytosis.

NASPGHAN pediatric IBD diagnosis — pediatricians "are ideally positioned to initiate the workup" when UC or CD is suspected, and initial laboratory studies "should assess for" inflammatory markers (elevated white blood cell and platelet counts, erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR], C-reactive protein [CRP]). Evaluation for gastrointestinal blood loss and anemia uses hemoglobin/hematocrit, and mean cell volume (MCV) distinguishes chronic disease (low MCV) from acute processes (normal MCV). Serum albumin is often low in newly diagnosed or flaring IBD, and liver function tests — alanine transaminase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, and g-glutamyltransferase (GGT) — can be elevated.

### The definition of anemia: what is the lower limit of normal of the blood hemoglobin concentration? [^111ULGRj]. Blood (2006). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of anemia is an important aspect of the practice of hematology. The first step is to decide whether the patient is, in fact, anemic. Unless earlier blood counts are available, and they often are not, the physician must make his or her decision on the basis of the population distribution of hemoglobin values. How likely is it that the patient's hemoglobin value lies below the normal distribution; that is, "the lower limit"?

Outcome and follow-up

On follow-up, the patient reported great improvement in her symptoms, including skin lesions and shortness of breath. She stated that her quality of life has positively changed. Her repeat laboratory results were also improved, with a haemoglobin level increasing to 112 g/L on follow-up after 2 months of initiation of therapy. In addition, the platelet count decreased from 11290 to 6550 ×10³ μL, which reinforces that this is most likely reactive thrombocytosis. The patient will continue to follow up regularly with primary care, haematology and dermatology. Initially, she was seen every 4–6 weeks; however, as her symptoms improved, the interval between follow-up appointments was gradually extended.

### How I treat anemia in older adults [^113HMPXu]. Blood (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion of case 1

This is a case of an older adult with a long-standing history of normocytic anemia and no overt etiology on routine testing. This is a common consult in hematology clinics and raises the question of both the necessary and sufficient evaluation. A focused history for bleeding or predisposition to bleeding (eg, antiplatelet or anticoagulants); major medical conditions related to inflammation, cancer, or gastrointestinal malabsorption; and personal or family history of anemia are important. The depth and duration of anemia are critical. In older age, a slow decline in hemoglobin of around 1 g/dL over 15 years can be expected.

In the absence of findings to direct the evaluation by history, we embark on a standard laboratory evaluation of anemia when testing has not been recently performed. These include a complete blood count (CBC) with differential, reticulocyte count, and peripheral smear review (Figure 1). The peripheral smear specifically assesses for RBC abnormalities, MDS, and leukemia disorders.

### The complete blood count-impact and distractions… [^113ZHrbf]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

In an intramural study at the University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, a CBC including 18 values, each with generous reference ranges, was performed on a medical school class. At least 1 variable outside the 95th percentile of normal was found in 87% of students; even for a CBC restricted to just 7 variables, 14% were flagged. Surveys of physicians find a remarkable variation in the specific content of a CBC they find useful. A 2020 study in Pakistan3 found that 80% of respondents indicated that only 3 variables were considered frequently or always useful.

Similarly, in a study conducted in Cleveland, Ohio, 4 variables were considered useful for screening by more than 90% of physicians; a fifth value, but not the red blood cell count, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, or MCH concentration, was deemed useful in the evaluation of anemia.
4. We have proposed that the CBC be stratified into 3 options. 8–10 The first is a screening CBC containing 5 variables for situations such as the annual health examination or evaluation of a minor medical issue: the hemoglobin, WBC, platelet counts, as well as MCV and red cell distribution width. A significant deviation in any of these would lead to a more comprehensive CBC, but that would be a very small fraction of those done.

Second, a follow-up CBC for situations in which the patient has had a diagnosis and many previous CBCs but is under repeated observation, such as being monitored while receiving cancer chemotherapy or immunotherapy; this would use 9 variables including the hemoglobin, MCV, RDW, platelet count, and the 5 absolute white cell counts. In this case, a WBC is unnecessary. Third, in situations in which the patient is undergoing a diagnostic evaluation for an illness, hematological or otherwise, a diagnostic CBC would be used. It would contain 10 variables including the hemoglobin, MCV, RDW, the 5 absolute leukocyte counts, a platelet count, a reticulocyte count and, in addition, an evaluation of the blood film by the laboratory.

Native vertebral osteomyelitis (NVO) — when to suspect: Clinicians should suspect the diagnosis of NVO in patients with new or worsening back or neck pain and fever (strong, low), should suspect the diagnosis of NVO in patients with new or worsening back or neck pain and elevated ESR or CRP (strong, low), and should suspect the diagnosis of NVO in patients with new or worsening back or neck pain and bloodstream infection or infective endocarditis (strong, low); clinicians may consider the diagnosis of NVO in patients who present with fever and new neurologic symptoms with or without back pain (weak, low) and may consider the diagnosis of NVO in patients who present with new localized neck or back pain, following an episode of Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infection (weak, low). Supporting evidence notes diagnostic delay with an average time to diagnosis of 2–4 months and initial misdiagnosis in 34% of 101 patients; fever is only present in up to 45% of patients with bacterial NVO; in a series of 253 patients with bacterial NVO, 43% had epidural or paravertebral extension; an elevated ESR or CRP result in patients with back pain has a sensitivity that can range from 94% to 100%; and up to 40% of patients with NVO have a normal white blood cell count.

### Whipple's disease: the great masquerader-a high level of suspicion is the key to diagnosis [^114HL3iX]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Patient 1

The patient was a 37-year-old Caucasian male, sporadic smoker, with moderate alcohol consumption, worked as a truck driver. Rheumatic symptoms had started 3 years before admission to hospital, with a transient swelling of one ring finger followed by intermittent episodes of fever with symmetrical and migratory pain, stiffness and in periods, swelling of several other joints. He was treated with non-steroidal and steroidal anti-inflammatory therapy due to palindromic rheumatism (PR) without improvement. The diagnosis was changed to seronegative rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and he was treated with methotrexate plus hydroxychloroquine. The joint stiffness continued while the swelling subsided.

Nine months later, he experienced gastrointestinal symptoms; flatulence, non-bloody diarrhea, sporadic vomiting, intermittent fever and slight weight loss. The body mass index (BMI) was 18.4 kg/m² (initial 19.7 kg/m²). Diarrhea gradually worsened with looser stool consistency, more frequent bowel emptying and abdominal pain. Anemia was detected with hemoglobin (Hb) of 120 g/L (normal range 134–170 g/L), hypoalbuminemia of 21 g/L (normal range 35–45 g/L). Stools were positive for hemoglobin and with an elevated level of calprotectin, 244 mg/kg (normal range 0–50 mg/kg). Anti-transglutaminase antibodies were negative. The symptoms aggravated with water-thin diarrhea up to 30 times a day, the onset of fatigue, and B-symptoms such as night sweats and fever peaks up to 40 degrees Celsius. A rectoscopy one month later was without pathological findings. By then, he had lost another 5 kg in weight (BMI 17 kg/m²) and was hospitalized. He underwent an abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan that showed signs of small bowel inflammation, why inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) — primarily Crohn's disease — was suspected. He was given methotrexate 20 mg once a week and hydroxychloroquine 200 mg every morning. Laboratory examinations showed leukocytes 9.2 × 10⁹/L, Hb 116 g/L, reticulocytes 24.6 × 10⁹/L, platelet count 397 × 10⁹/L, C-reactive protein (CRP) 19 mg/L, albumin 22 g/L and Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) 16 mm/h. Fecal cultures for Salmonella, Shigella, Yersinia, and Campylobacter were negative as was cytotoxin testing for Clostridium difficile. A second CT scan showed pathologically enlarged lymph nodes extending paraaortically from upper abdomen down into the small pelvis and also ventrally in the mesentery. The working diagnosis was changed from IBD to malignant lymphoma and he was discharged from hospital and referred to oncological care. His condition deteriorated with significant fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and continued water-thin diarrhea 15–20 times per day with blood. He lost another 5 kg by weight (BMI 15.9 kg/m²).

### Diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndromes: the classic and the novel [^114EUrzm]. Haematologica (2025). Medium credibility.

Laboratory findings

Table 1 lists the laboratory abnormalities that are typical, yet not specific for patients with MDS. C-reactive protein levels and erythrocyte sedimentation rate can be elevated. At least 90% of MDS patients will be anemic, and ~50% of them will have a hemoglobin concentration of less than 10 g/dL. The anemia is usually mildly macrocytic, with an increased red cell distribution width. Reflecting the BM dysfunction that characterizes MDS, patients usually do not have an increased reticulocyte count, in contrast to patients with hemolytic anemia. Table 1 lists other laboratory findings.

Serum chemistry is usually normal unless there is a comorbidity associated with anemia. Serum iron and iron saturation as well as serum ferritin can be elevated in the sideroblastic subtype. It is important to exclude nutritional deficiencies, especially folic acid and vitamin B12 deficiency, both of which can cause macrocytic anemia. Blood chemistries can also rule out underlying liver or kidney disease. Hepatitis B and C, cytomegalovirus, human immunodeficiency virus and parvovirus B19 infections must be ruled out.

The PB smear is usually non-specific, but it might show features consistent with disease. For example, the red blood cells (RBC) might have anisocytosis or poikylocytos, and sometimes there may be nucleated RBC. The white blood cells may include an increased number of immature myeloid cells ("left shift") with hypolobulation ("Pelger"-like cells) and hypogranulation. PB platelets might be distorted, clumped, and big (megaplatelets), in addition to being present in low number. Persistent monocytosis suggests CMML, on the assumption that other etiologies for monocytosis have been excluded. The PB smear is especially helpful in that it may uncover a disease other than or in addition to MDS. For example, thrombocytosis or leukocytosis would suggest an MPN, or at least an overlap MDS/MPN syndrome.

Altogether, the combination of symptoms and laboratory findings along with the exclusion of other causes of anemia/cytopenia, raises the suspicion of MDS (Table 1), but other investigations are required in order to establish the diagnosis of MDS.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines for the management of iron deficiency anaemia in adults [^113DECq2]. Gut (2021). Medium credibility.

In summary, an SF < 15 µg/L is highly specific for iron deficiency (specificity 0.99). A cut-off of 45 µg/L provides a respectable specificity of 0.92, and figures below this may warrant consideration of GI investigation, especially in the context of a chronic inflammatory process with anaemia.

The sTfR concentration is a good marker of iron deficiency in otherwise healthy subjects, but it can also be raised where there is increased erythropoietic drive such as with haemolytic anaemias, thalassaemias and Hb E — and most UK hospitals do not provide this test. The [sTfR/log₁₀ ferritin] ratio may provide superior discrimination to either test on its own, particularly in chronic disease.

A therapeutic trial of oral iron replacement therapy (IRT) for 2–4 weeks may aid with the diagnosis of IDA, but is dependent on compliance. A ≥ 10 g/L rise in Hb over a 2-week period is highly sensitive for absolute iron deficiency. While further tests to confirm iron deficiency are occasionally necessary, estimation of iron concentration in bone marrow is invasive, often subjective and difficult to justify in most cases.

After excluding thalassaemia carriage, low Retic-Hb provides evidence of iron restriction, and should be considered in the laboratory work-up of anaemia particularly where there is chronic renal impairment. Retic-Hb is reported to be a more reliable marker of iron restriction than sTfR in healthy blood donors. An early indicator of response to iron therapy in IDA is provided by a rising Retic-Hb on day 4, similar to the observation of a falling percentage of hypochromic red cells in response to therapy. An algorithm for the diagnostic approach to IDA is suggested in figure 1.

Subacute thyroiditis — diagnosis and management include characteristic pain radiating to the ears, jaw, or throat with malaise, low-grade fever, and fatigue; laboratory markers show that the erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein is elevated, mild anemia is common, RAIU is low, and ultrasonography shows diffuse heterogeneity with decreased or normal color-flow Doppler. Patients with mild symptomatic subacute thyroiditis should be treated initially with beta-adrenergic-blocking drugs and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, and those failing to respond or with moderate-to-severe symptoms should be treated with corticosteroids. 1/+00 NSAIDs should be considered first-line therapy; if full doses over several days fail, use corticosteroids such as prednisone 40 mg daily for 1–2 weeks followed by a gradual taper over 2–4 weeks or longer depending upon clinical response. During the hypothyroid stage, levothyroxine may be employed but should be withdrawn after 3–6 months with recovery of normal function verified by thyroid function testing.

### 'Common' uncommon anemias… [^114nectP]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

In fact, there is an inverse relationship between blood urea nitrogen levels and red blood cell life span. More important, however, is the diminished renal production or the dysfunction of erythropoietin that results in decreased red blood cell production. Although the erythropoietin levels may be low, normal or high, they are inappropriately low when adjusted for the degree of anemia. Androgens were used in the past in an attempt to stimulate red blood cell production, but the administration of erythropoietin has effectively replaced this treatment. In patients with a relative deficiency of erythropoietin, both intravenous and subcutaneous administration of erythropoietin increases the reticulocyte count and red blood cell mass in a dose-related manner. 3 Even when iron stores are adequate, iron supplementation is usually needed with erythropoietin administration because enhanced red blood cell production rapidly depletes the stores.

Erythropoietin can be given three times per week, but higher dosages on a once-per-week basis may also be effective. Because erythropoietin therapy is expensive, the decision to use it should be made on clinical grounds rather than on the basis of an absolute hemoglobin level. Therefore, iron is present but inaccessible for use in the production of hemoglobin within erythrocytes. A poor response to or a relative decrease in erythropoietin production complicates the anemia. 4 Finally, an unexplained slightly shortened red blood cell survival also contributes to the anemia. Although ACD may become marked, it is usually nonprogressive, with hemoglobin levels remaining above 9 g per dL. Erythrocytes are normocytic or mildly microcytic. Often the peripheral blood smear is nearly normal, as shown in.

These patients have mild to minimal anemia with hypochromic and microcytic red blood cells. Splenic enlargement may also be present. A family history of anemia may be the most important factor in the hematologic evaluation. β-Thalassemia minor is easily confirmed by hemoglobin electrophoresis, which shows an elevated hemoglobin A.

### Why shouldn' T we determine the erythrocyte sedimentation rate? [^115DPZX9]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

A test that is meant to measure a given parameter is more likely to detect changes in that parameter if it is not affected by factors other than those which it is intended to quantitate. The clinical use of the laboratory test for determining the erythrocyte sedimentation rate is backed by nearly a century of experience. Although its nonspecificity is acknowledged, it has been used to quantitate the inflammatory process that underlies infectious, inflammatory, and neoplastic disorders. I believe that this venerable test is affected by too many factors in addition to that which we think we are measuring, to the point that its clinical usefulness is severely compromised.

Results

Participant characteristics and sequencing data

This study examined fecal samples from 22 patients with active CD, 10 patients with inactive CD, and 32 healthy controls. Baseline data, including age, sex, body mass index (BMI), and clinical features of CD patients (such as general clinical data, Montreal classification, CDAI, and surgical history), were obtained from medical records and direct interviews. Compared with healthy controls, CD patients tended to be younger and have a lower BMI at diagnosis, while the sex distribution did not significantly differ between CD patients and healthy controls. Many CD patients display elevated high-sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP) levels, white blood cell (WBC) counts, platelet (PLT) counts, and erythrocyte sedimentation rates (ESRs), indicating ongoing intestinal inflammation. Moreover, these patients commonly exhibit reduced levels of hemoglobin (Hb), albumin (ALB), and the albumin/globulin ratio (A/G), suggesting compromised intestinal nutrient absorption. The detailed general and clinical characteristics of the included CD patients and healthy controls are presented in Table 2. The background of each patient with remission and active CD is shown in Table S1. The specific clinical characteristics of CD patients. I patients and CD.

All patients displayed recurrent and simultaneously occurring inflammatory manifestations, frequently triggered by cold exposure (31%) or stress (31%). The most frequent manifestations at diagnosis included urticaria-like rash (100%), arthralgia (87%), recurrent fever (75%), arthritis (68%), and headache (56%) (Table 1; Fig. 2). Before starting anti-IL-1 treatment, nearly all patients presented marked analytical perturbations. The most frequent hematological abnormalities included low mean hemoglobin concentration (14/16 patients; 87.5%), increased mean neutrophil count (14/16 patients; 87.5%), increased mean leukocyte count (12/16 patients; 75.0%), and increased mean platelet count (7/16 patients; 43.75%) (Supplementary Table S2, and Supplementary Figures S1 and S2). Among biochemical tests, a moderate-to-high increase in erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) serum concentration was detected in nearly all patients (87.5% and 100%, respectively) (Supplementary Table S3 and Supplementary Figure S3). As two different groups were identified based on age at disease onset, we performed a comparative analysis of their disease manifestations, with the results being shown in the Fig. 2 and in the Supplementary Table S4.

Regarding medical management for essential thrombocythemia, more specifically with respect to cytoreductive therapy, ELN 2018 guidelines recommend to avoid initiating cytoreductive therapy in otherwise low- or intermediate-risk patients with well-controlled cardiovascular risk factors. Initiate cytoreductive therapy in patients with ET as soon as they shift to the high-risk category by reaching the age of 60 years or by the occurrence of a major thrombotic or hemorrhagic event, or if platelet counts increase > 1, 500×10⁹/L.

### Iron deficiency anaemia revisited [^114M6UDR]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency anaemia is a global health concern affecting children, women and the elderly, whilst also being a common comorbidity in multiple medical conditions. The aetiology is variable and attributed to several risk factors decreasing iron intake and absorption or increasing demand and loss, with multiple aetiologies often coexisting in an individual patient. Although presenting symptoms may be nonspecific, there is emerging evidence on the detrimental effects of iron deficiency anaemia on clinical outcomes across several medical conditions. Increased awareness about the consequences and prevalence of iron deficiency anaemia can aid early detection and management. Diagnosis can be easily made by measurement of haemoglobin and serum ferritin levels, whilst in chronic inflammatory conditions, diagnosis may be more challenging and necessitates consideration of higher serum ferritin thresholds and evaluation of transferrin saturation. Oral and intravenous formulations of iron supplementation are available, and several patient and disease-related factors need to be considered before management decisions are made. This review provides recent updates and guidance on the diagnosis and management of iron deficiency anaemia in multiple clinical settings.

### Diagnosis and management of anaemia of chronic disease: current status [^112ekgeq]. British Journal of Haematology (2011). Low credibility.

Anaemia of chronic disease is the second most common form of anaemia worldwide, and is seen in a variety of inflammatory, infective and malignant diseases. Functional iron deficiency is fundamental to the pathogenesis of the anaemia, and the polypeptide, hepcidin, plays a key role. Diagnosis may be difficult, but new automated red cell indices, algorithms for detection of functional iron deficiency, and assays for hepcidin levels are being developed. Management of the causative disease process will usually improve haemoglobin levels, but where this is not possible, erythropoietic stimulating agents are often used, although there are still concerns about potential adverse effects, especially thromboembolism. There is increasing evidence that supplemental iron given parenterally can safely overcome the functional iron deficiency. Inhibitors of hepcidin, and various inflammatory modulators show promise for the future.

### Spinal epidural abscess – experience with 46 patients and evaluation of prognostic factors [^111QKL2i]. The Journal of Infection (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

Spinal epidural abscess is a rare infectious disorder, often with a delayed diagnosis, and associated with significant morbidity and mortality rates. We conducted a retrospective study to define its clinical characteristics and to evaluate its prognostic factors.

Methods

The medical charts of 46 patients (36 men and 10 women) with spinal epidural abscess over a 10-year period (from July 1991 to May 2000) were reviewed and analyzed.

Results

A high proportion of patients had underlying diseases of diabetes (46%), frequent venous puncture (35%), spinal trauma (24%), and history of spinal surgery (22%). The initial accurate diagnostic rate was 11%. Localized spinal pain (89%), paralysis (80%), fever/chills (67%), and radicular pain (57%) were the common manifestations. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was elevated uniformly (mean, 86.6 mm/h) when measured. Staphylococcus aureus was the most common cause of spinal epidural abscess isolated from blood (39%) and pus (50%). Low platelet counts (< 100 × 10⁹/L) (odds ratio (OR): 8.8, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.0–77.8), extremely high ESR (≥ 110 mm/h) (OR: 4.8, 95% CI: 0.9–25.4), and cervical spine epidural abscess (OR: 5.2, 95% CI: 0.8–32.0) predicted a poor outcome.

Conclusions

Localized back pain in a febrile patient with significant risk for epidural abscess warrants an immediate magnetic resonance imaging examination. The presence of thrombocytopenia, extremely elevated ESR, or evidence of spinal cord compression should prompt aggressive treatment.

### How to manage polycythemia vera [^112DVQRU]. Leukemia (2012). Low credibility.

My diagnostic approach in case of isolated erythrocytosis is based on the visit and the interview of patients, and on checking the causes of secondary erythrocytosis. If causes of secondary erythrocytosis are not evident and serum erythropoietin level is low-normal, I study JAK2 mutations. In the case of a patient with erythrocytosis and other signs of myeloproliferation, such as leukocytosis, thrombocytosis or splenomegaly, the diagnosis of polycythemia vera (PV) is likely, and I test serum erythropoietin and JAK2 mutations first. I stratify patients at diagnosis of PV according to age and history of thrombosis. I start hydroxyurea for patients who are at a high risk of thrombosis (that is, with one or two risk factors), while I continue only phlebotomy in other cases. All PV patients, if not contraindicated, receive aspirin. I follow up patients monthly until normalization of their blood cell counts or splenomegaly, and afterwards every 2 months with visit, cell blood count and blood smear evaluation. After diagnosis, I perform bone marrow biopsy only in the case of clinical signs of disease evolution.

### EANM consensus document on the use of [F] FDG PET / CT in fever and inflammation of unknown origin [^113R5WJL]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2024). Medium credibility.

Pre-scan laboratory tests

CRP is a well-established nonspecific marker of infection, inflammation, and malignancy with an essential role in clinical routine. CRP is elevated in most cases of prolonged fever, FUO and IUO, but the association between CRP thresholds and contribution of [18 F]FDG PET/CT remains controversial. Several reports showed a significant association between CRP levels and prediction of usefulness, while others did not observe this relation, and similar opposing results were encountered in pediatric patients. The majority of patients in the abovementioned reports had elevated CRP, but no cut-off value has been established to select patients for [18 F]FDG PET/CT or to predict helpfulness. Some suggest the number of PET/CT positive patients increase with increasing CRP, and some studies report that PET/CT-positive findings are very rare in patients with normal CRP-levels, but there are also patients in some studies that are PET/CT positive despite normal CRP levels.

Other pre-scan laboratory tests showed similar contradictory results: ESR, leukocyte count, platelets, serum procalcitonin, and hemoglobin. One study suggested a positive association between the number of inflammatory markers, final diagnosis, and [18 F]FDG PET/CT results. In HIV-patients with FUO, controversy also remains whether a correlation exists between [18 F]FDG uptake and HIV viremia.

In conclusion, several pre-scan laboratory tests are routinely used depending on the clinical setting. However, their impact on [18 F]FDG PET/CT yield is unclear and further studies are warranted especially aiming to establish a valid CRP cut-off in FUO (currently ranging from 7 to 50 mg/L). On the other hand, the yield or helpfulness of [18 F]FDG PET/CT in the presence of normal or low CRP values is very low.

Pre-scan imaging

Some relatively simple and inexpensive diagnostic tests are still recommended as first-line for patients with FUO/IUO to separate relatively more apparent diseases from true FUO/IUO cases, but there is no consensus on which modality to employ. Some sugge st abdominal ultrasound and chest X-ray in low-resource areas, some suggest CT, and others suggest an imaging approach guided by symptoms and clinico-biochemical findings, but there is no firm evidence to support a standardized imaging strategy that should routinely precede [18 F]FDG PET/CT.

### Clinical practice guideline by the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society and the Infectious Diseases Society of America: 2021 guideline on diagnosis and management of acute hematogenous osteomyelitis in pediatrics [^114NthJk]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2021). High credibility.

Complete blood count (CBC) parameters in pediatric acute hematogenous osteomyelitis — The peripheral white blood cell (WBC) count can be elevated but is in the normal range in most children, and the accuracy of the WBC count for the diagnosis of AHO is less than that of CRP; WBC count may be higher on average with MRSA etiology and in complicated cases, yet WBC counts overlap considerably among these etiologies and scenarios and do not provide discriminatory value. The information provided by a CBC can provide important adjunctive information for decision-making for children with suspected or confirmed AHO, and anemia and reactive thrombocytosis may be seen in some children with AHO at presentation.

### Anemia of inflammation [^117Bn4Sx]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Anemia of inflammation (AI, also called anemia of chronic disease) is a common, typically normocytic, normochromic anemia that is caused by an underlying inflammatory disease. It is diagnosed when serum iron concentrations are low despite adequate iron stores, as evidenced by serum ferritin that is not low. In the setting of inflammation, it may be difficult to differentiate AI from iron deficiency anemia, and the 2 conditions may coexist. Treatment should focus on the underlying disease. Recent advances in molecular understanding of AI are stimulating the development of new pathophysiologically targeted experimental therapies.

### Evidence-based diagnostics: adult septic arthritis [^111Zyui6]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Acutely swollen or painful joints are common complaints in the emergency department (ED). Septic arthritis in adults is a challenging diagnosis, but prompt differentiation of a bacterial etiology is crucial to minimize morbidity and mortality.

Objectives

The objective was to perform a systematic review describing the diagnostic characteristics of history, physical examination, and bedside laboratory tests for nongonococcal septic arthritis. A secondary objective was to quantify test and treatment thresholds using derived estimates of sensitivity and specificity, as well as best-evidence diagnostic and treatment risks and anticipated benefits from appropriate therapy.

Methods

Two electronic search engines (PUBMED and EMBASE) were used in conjunction with a selected bibliography and scientific abstract hand search. Inclusion criteria included adult trials of patients presenting with monoarticular complaints if they reported sufficient detail to reconstruct partial or complete 2 × 2 contingency tables for experimental diagnostic test characteristics using an acceptable criterion standard. Evidence was rated by two investigators using the Quality Assessment Tool for Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS). When more than one similarly designed trial existed for a diagnostic test, meta-analysis was conducted using a random effects model. Interval likelihood ratios (LRs) were computed when possible. To illustrate one method to quantify theoretical points in the probability of disease whereby clinicians might cease testing altogether and either withhold treatment (test threshold) or initiate definitive therapy in lieu of further diagnostics (treatment threshold), an interactive spreadsheet was designed and sample calculations were provided based on research estimates of diagnostic accuracy, diagnostic risk, and therapeutic risk/benefits.

Results

The prevalence of nongonococcal septic arthritis in ED patients with a single acutely painful joint is approximately 27% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 17% to 38%). With the exception of joint surgery (positive likelihood ratio [+LR] = 6.9) or skin infection overlying a prosthetic joint (+LR = 15.0), history, physical examination, and serum tests do not significantly alter posttest probability. Serum inflammatory markers such as white blood cell (WBC) counts, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and C-reactive protein (CRP) are not useful acutely. The interval LR for synovial white blood cell (sWBC) counts of 0 × 10⁹-25 × 10⁹/L was 0.33; for 25 × 10⁹-50 × 10⁹/L, 1.06; for 50 × 10⁹-100 × 10⁹/L, 3.59; and exceeding 100 × 10⁹/L, infinity. Synovial lactate may be useful to rule in or rule out the diagnosis of septic arthritis with a +LR ranging from 2.4 to infinity, and negative likelihood ratio (-LR) ranging from 0 to 0.46. Rapid polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of synovial fluid may identify the causative organism within 3 hours. Based on 56% sensitivity and 90% specificity for sWBC counts of > 50 × 10⁹/L in conjunction with best-evidence estimates for diagnosis-related risk and treatment-related risk/benefit, the arthrocentesis test threshold is 5%, with a treatment threshold of 39%.

Conclusions

Recent joint surgery or cellulitis overlying a prosthetic hip or knee were the only findings on history or physical examination that significantly alter the probability of nongonococcal septic arthritis. Extreme values of sWBC (> 50 × 10⁹/L) can increase, but not decrease, the probability of septic arthritis. Future ED-based diagnostic trials are needed to evaluate the role of clinical gestalt and the efficacy of nontraditional synovial markers such as lactate.

### Guide to utilization of the microbiology laboratory for diagnosis of infectious diseases: 2024 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) [^115mBWHo]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Osteomyelitis — diagnostic evaluation is typically based on clinical suspicion with confirmation by imaging and laboratory methods, and inflammatory markers are often elevated: the peripheral white blood cell count may be elevated; erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) are often elevated as well. Establishing an etiologic diagnosis nearly always requires obtaining bone for microbiologic evaluation unless blood cultures are positive in the context of convincing radiographic findings, which can be accomplished by imaging-guided or surgical sampling. As much specimen as possible should be submitted to the laboratory; specimens may include pieces of intact bone, shavings, scrapings, and/or excised or aspirated necrotic material. Swabs are not recommended and cultures of sinus tracts are generally not recommended, because recovered organisms, aside from Staphylococcus aureus, do not correlate well with those found in deep cultures. In adults, imaging-guided aspiration or open biopsy is typically necessary, and those with underlying diabetes mellitus or vascular insufficiency are at particular risk for osteomyelitis.

E-cigarette or vaping product use-associated lung injury (EVALI) clinical care — clinical presentation describes that EVALI typically presents as an acute or subacute respiratory illness with nonspecific symptoms including shortness of breath, cough, chest pain, and/or hemoptysis. Most patients also have gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhea and/or constitutional symptoms such as fever, chills, fatigue, and/or weight loss. Symptoms develop over days to weeks, and laboratory findings are nonspecific and may include elevated white blood cell count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate.

### Laboratory values for children with newly diagnosed inflammatory bowel disease [^11574pZT]. Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

The goal was to determine how often common laboratory tests yield normal results at the time of diagnosis for children with inflammatory bowel disease.

Methods

Data were obtained from a registry of children with newly diagnosed inflammatory bowel disease who were enrolled prospectively in 18 US/Canadian centers. Laboratory values investigated included hemoglobin level, platelet count, albumin level, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Disease severity was categorized by physician global assessment.

Results

A total of 526 children (mean age: 11.6 years; 58% male; 392 with Crohn disease and 134 with ulcerative colitis) were studied. All 4 values were normal for 21% of patients with mild Crohn disease and 54% with mild ulcerative colitis. In contrast, only 3.8% of children with moderate/severe Crohn disease and 4.3% with moderate/severe ulcerative colitis had normal results for all 4 tests. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was least likely to be normal; overall, 26% of patients with inflammatory bowel disease had a normal erythrocyte sedimentation rate, including 18% with moderate/severe disease. Hemoglobin levels were normal for 32%, platelet counts for 50%, and albumin levels for 60%. There was no clear association between Crohn disease location and either severity or number of normal laboratory values. In contrast, there were direct correlations between ulcerative colitis disease severity and both the extent of bowel inflammation and the number of abnormal laboratory tests.

Conclusion

The presence of normal screening laboratory studies should not dissuade clinicians from considering a diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease.

Results

Q.1: In patients with suspected complicated IBD, which are the appropriate biochemical investigations that should be performed?

Statement 1.1

In clinical practice, the diagnosis of CD and UC is based on a set of modalities including clinical, biochemical, endoscopic, radiological, and histological diagnostics rather than a single reference standard (QoE low C).

Statement 1.2

In assessing an acute abdomen in patients with IBD, laboratory tests including full blood count, electrolytes, liver enzymes, inflammatory biomarkers such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP), and serum albumin and pre-albumin (to assess nutritional status and degree of inflammation) are mandatory (QoE moderate B).

Statement 1.3

In case of a suspected IBD flare, infectious causes should be ruled out, especially Clostridium difficile and Cytomegalovirus (QoE low C).

Recommendation

We recommend assessing Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis disease activity in the urgent clinical situation by performing the following laboratory tests: a full blood count, including hemoglobin, leukocyte count, and platelet count; serum C-reactive protein level, erythrocyte sedimentation rate; serum electrolytes; liver enzymes level; serum albumin; renal function; and fecal calprotectin level, when it is possible. It is mandatory to exclude any infectious diseases by performing blood-, stool cultures, and toxin test for Clostridium difficile (strong recommendation based on a moderate level of evidence 1B).

Summary of evidence and discussion

In assessing a patient with acute abdominal pain in the emergency room, the main laboratory tests requested are full blood count (20.1%), electrolytes (19.1%), cardiac enzymes (19.0%), and liver function tests (11.5%).

In differentiating the cause underlying acute abdominal pain, the diagnostic accuracy values of C-reactive protein (CRP) and white blood cell count (WBC) can be elevated.

IBD disease activity will usually impact laboratory tests results with anemia, leukocytosis, thrombocytosis, elevated liver enzymes, hypoalbuminemia, and increased inflammatory markers. In addition, therapies may cause abnormalities in liver enzymes, leukocytes, and kidney function. Consequently, for patients with IBD admitted to the emergency room for evaluation, laboratory tests should always include full blood count with differential, comprehensive metabolic panel, liver enzymes, and lipase.

### The diagnosis and management of recurrent ischemic priapism, priapism in sickle cell patients, and non-ischemic priapism: an AUA / SMSNA guideline [^1146czSR]. The Journal of Urology (2022). High credibility.

AUA/SMSNA guideline — laboratory evaluation in acute ischemic priapism states that optimal blood tests have not been defined and should be selectively ordered based on specific patient risk factors and clinical suspicion; a complete blood count (CBC) may identify elevated white blood cell counts suggesting malignancy. Among men with sickle cell disease (SCD), acute ischemic priapism is associated with lower hemoglobin and elevated lactate dehydrogenase, bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase, reticulocyte count, white blood cells, and platelet counts, and platelet and eosinophil counts may also be elevated; however, these laboratory values often will not be used to guide treatment of the acute presentation. Hemoglobin electrophoresis or similar hemoglobinopathy testing may be appropriate in select clinical scenarios, and electrophoresis and other sickle cell testing should be reserved for select clinical scenarios, while a reticulocyte count will assist in determining the status of a patient with SCD and may be incorporated into the workup along with a CBC. Testing for potential substances may have a high rate of false negativity, and given these associated risks, a thorough medication and social history may provide enough information to determine the underlying cause without collection of these studies.

Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2021). High credibility.

Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) in pediatric acute hematogenous osteomyelitis — Historically, case series have described ESR elevation in 90% to 100% of children with AHO, but rates as low as 70% to 87% also have been reported, and ESR combined with CRP may slightly improve sensitivity and negative predictive value for the diagnosis of AHO, but specific thresholds and the overall clinical utility of using both CRP and ESR for diagnostic purposes remain uncertain. The ESR tends to rise more slowly than CRP in acute infection and to decrease more slowly than CRP in an appropriately treated infection; the ESR is no longer used routinely to diagnose AHO in children.

### AAOS systematic literature review: summary on the management of surgical site infections [^114bokvK]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2019). High credibility.

Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) for surgical site infection (SSI) diagnosis — Limited strength evidence does not support the use of ESR, alone, to rule in and rule out surgical site infections due to conflicting data, with the Strength of Recommendation: Limited. Multiple high-quality studies have demonstrated moderate to weak ability of ESR as a solitary test to diagnose or exclude surgical site infection, and it is felt to be too variable with respect to time from surgery and in the presence of other confounding factors to be considered an accurate tool in diagnosis alone; ESR may be considered as a tool to be used in conjunction with other tests. There is no risk with implementation of this test/recommendation; however, ESR should rarely be considered in isolation, and ESR should be used in combination with other tests to mitigate the risk of incorrect diagnoses. Future investigations will likely examine the use of ESR in combination with other diagnostic markers.

### Stroke risk and risk factors in patients with central retinal artery occlusion [^115NK9XH]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

Central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) is mechanistically similar to a stroke. Current guidelines recommend a standardized and systematic evaluation of risk factors for patients who have had a stroke. This study evaluates the yield of this evaluation in patients with CRAO and frequency of stroke in this population.

Design

Cohort study.

Methods

We evaluated the diagnostic yield of an expedited inpatient evaluation of cerebrovascular risk factors in a cohort of patients presenting with an acute CRAO within the period from 2009 to 2017 at an academic hospital. Vital signs and laboratory parameters, including low-density lipoprotein level, hemoglobin A1c fraction, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein level, platelet count, and troponin level, were collected. Echocardiography, cardiac telemetry, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and cerebrovascular imaging were obtained to screen for strokes and vascular risk factors. All new diagnoses and clinical treatments stemming from the inpatient evaluation were documented. Outcomes included the frequency of stroke on MRI, hypertensive emergency, critical carotid disease, or critical cardiac disease, including high-grade valvular lesions, new myocardial infarction, or arrhythmias. We documented the frequency of a change in medication, acute surgical intervention, or new diagnosis of systemic disease as a result of the inpatient evaluation. Finally, we evaluated the rate of symptomatic stroke, myocardial infarct, and death risk in the 24 months after CRAO.

Results

In this cohort of 103 patients with CRAO and systematic risk factor screening, 36.7% of patients had critical carotid disease, 37.3% had coincident acute stroke, 33.0% presented with hypertensive emergency, 20.0% had a myocardial infarction or critical structural cardiac disease, 25% underwent an urgent surgical intervention, and 93% had a change in medication as a result of the inpatient evaluation. Patients with CRAO had similar risk of subsequent stroke, myocardial infarction, and death as patients with high-risk transient ischemic attack.

Conclusions

Patients with CRAO are at significant risk of future cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events and often have undiagnosed risk factors that may be modifiable.

### How I treat anemia in older adults [^115BrY5w]. Blood (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Anemia is a common sign with protean causes and manifestations. A systematic approach to evaluation and management of anemia ensures appropriate care that may optimize hemoglobin and potentially ameliorate anemia-related morbidity while minimizing unnecessary testing. Nevertheless, further research is necessary because often anemia in older age has no discernible cause or proven therapy.
