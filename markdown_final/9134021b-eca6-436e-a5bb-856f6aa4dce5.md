## Question

What options are available for someone with a chronic total occlusion of coronary artery

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about treatment options for chronic total coronary occlusion (CTO), including how to choose among optimal medical therapy, percutaneous coronary intervention, and coronary artery bypass grafting, with attention to evidence, risks, and patient selection. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining CTO and establishing baseline management with optimal medical therapy. Then, I should verify the indications and outcomes for CTO PCI versus OMT from randomized trials and meta-analyses. Next, I will examine CABG as an alternative strategy and how it fits with multivessel disease. After that, I need to review special populations such as older adults, patients with prior CABG, and those with reduced ejection fraction. Finally, I should integrate preprocedural planning, risk stratification, and a practical decision framework, while double-checking guideline positions and acknowledging uncertainties that require shared decision-making.

> Let me first confirm the definition and baseline management. CTO is a 100% coronary occlusion with TIMI 0 flow persisting for at least 3 months, and it is common, present in roughly 15–25% of patients with stable coronary artery disease undergoing angiography, which underscores the need for a structured approach to management [^1177Kg1Q] [^116dsKyA]. I should confirm that optimal medical therapy (OMT) is the foundation for all patients, including guideline-directed antianginals, risk-factor modification, and lifestyle therapy, and that OMT alone can control symptoms in many patients while we assess candidacy for revascularization [^116SypYQ] [^1116g9RZ].

> Now, I will examine CTO PCI indications and expected benefits. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about mortality; randomized trials show that CTO PCI improves angina and quality of life but has not consistently reduced death or myocardial infarction compared with OMT, so symptom relief is the clearest, most reproducible benefit across EURO-CTO and multiple meta-analyses, whereas DECISION-CTO was neutral for both MACE and quality of life due to design limitations and crossover [^111SjmrJ] [^116dsKyA] [^115PudDA]. Wait, let me verify the magnitude of symptom benefit; pooled analyses suggest clinically meaningful improvements in SAQ domains, with a mean difference around 4–6 points and higher rates of angina freedom after successful CTO PCI, which aligns with patient-centered goals in appropriately selected patients [^116dsKyA] [^111SjmrJ].

> Next, I should review risks and technical realities. CTO PCI carries higher complication rates than non-CTO PCI, including perforation around 4–5% and a 30-day mortality near 1.3% in contemporary registries, and success is operator- and center-dependent, with experienced CTO operators achieving 85–90% success while lower-volume operators have substantially lower success, reinforcing the need for referral to high-volume CTO centers when PCI is pursued [^114uX7Lz] [^113bzory] [^111CWDb3]. I need to ensure I emphasize that risk rises with lesion complexity, older age, and advanced techniques such as retrograde crossing, which should be weighed carefully in shared decision-making [^114RPWfM].

> Let me consider CABG as an alternative. In multivessel disease with CTO, CABG remains a durable option that bypasses the CTO and achieves complete revascularization; observational and comparative data suggest survival advantages for revascularization over medical therapy, though the advantage of PCI over OMT is less consistent in CTO cohorts, and CABG may be preferred when anatomy is unfavorable for PCI or when multiple CTOs or diffuse disease are present [^114DeiNJ] [^111LzcZs]. But wait, what if the patient already had CABG? Native artery CTO PCI is often favored over repeat surgery due to higher risk and limited graft durability, and CTO PCI in post-CABG patients is increasingly used when feasible, albeit with higher complexity and sometimes lower success [^112Kqxqf].

> I should double-check special populations. In older adults, CTO PCI can improve quality of life but success is lower and complications are higher, so the threshold to attempt PCI should be higher and decisions should prioritize symptom relief and functional independence rather than mortality modification, with careful frailty and comorbidity assessment [^112e4HUs] [^112k1Nsg]. In patients with reduced ejection fraction, observational data suggest potential improvements in ventricular function and symptoms after successful CTO PCI, but randomized trials have not consistently shown LVEF gains, so viability assessment and ischemia burden are critical to avoid futile procedures in scarred territories [^1135o4Gh] [^114uX7Lz].

> Next, I should review preprocedural planning and risk stratification. Let me verify that contemporary CTO programs rely on structured planning: dual injection angiography, assessment of proximal and distal caps, lesion length, calcification, and collateral suitability, with adjunctive imaging such as coronary CT angiography to define anatomy and CT perfusion or SPECT/CMR to quantify ischemia and viability; validated scores like J-CTO and CASTLE help predict success and complications and guide strategy selection [^116BNxsb] [^113xFn2b] [^11457KBG]. Hold on, I should confirm that robust collaterals facilitate PCI success but do not mitigate long-term risk, so collateral grade should not falsely reassure against revascularization when ischemia or symptoms are significant [^116vQunE].

> I will now examine the decision framework. For asymptomatic patients with low ischemic burden, OMT alone is reasonable; for symptomatic patients with refractory angina or objective ischemia in the CTO territory, CTO PCI should be considered after treating non-CTO lesions, with the understanding that the primary benefit is symptom relief rather than mortality reduction, and that operator expertise and anatomy suitability strongly influence outcomes [^114uX7Lz] [^116qNV4p]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied that a large ischemic burden alone mandates PCI; I should correct that to say it strengthens the indication for revascularization, but the choice between PCI and CABG still depends on anatomy, comorbidities, and patient preferences, with CABG favored for complex multivessel disease and PCI favored for favorable CTO anatomy and high-probability success [^116qNV4p] [^113z8We2].

> Let me synthesize the three options succinctly. Option 1 is optimal medical therapy, appropriate for asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic patients, those with low ischemic burden, high procedural risk, or patient preference, recognizing that many patients will have acceptable symptom control with GDMT alone [^116SypYQ] [^1116g9RZ]. Option 2 is CTO PCI, appropriate for patients with refractory angina or significant ischemia in the CTO territory, favorable anatomy, and access to experienced operators, with counseling that the clearest benefit is improved quality of life and angina relief rather than reduced mortality, and with acknowledgment of higher complication rates and the possibility of failure [^116dsKyA] [^111SjmrJ]. Option 3 is CABG, preferred for multivessel disease with complex anatomy, multiple CTOs, or when PCI success is unlikely, offering durable revascularization at the cost of surgical morbidity, and particularly relevant when complete revascularization will impact prognosis or symptoms [^114DeiNJ] [^111LzcZs].

> Finally, I need to ensure the plan addresses uncertainties and ongoing evidence gaps. Large randomized trials have been underpowered or confounded by crossover, and long-term mortality differences remain unproven; ongoing studies like ISCHEMIA-CTO may clarify prognostic benefits, and until then, decisions should be individualized and anchored in shared decision-making that weighs symptom burden, ischemia, anatomy, operator expertise, and patient values, with explicit discussion of risks, benefits, and alternatives [^114JVjmp] [^114uX7Lz] [^115PudDA].

For chronic total coronary occlusion (CTO), management options include **optimal medical therapy (OMT)** [^111SeTk5] with antianginals and risk-factor control, **percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)** [^114uX7Lz] for symptom relief in selected patients, and **coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG)** [^116qNV4p] for complex multivessel disease or failed PCI. PCI is indicated for **refractory angina** or a **large ischemic burden** [^116qNV4p] after OMT, with success rates of 85–90% at experienced centers [^113bzory] but higher complication rates than non-CTO PCI [^114RPWfM]. CABG is preferred for complex multivessel disease or when PCI is not feasible [^113z8We2]. OMT alone is appropriate for asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic patients [^116SypYQ] with low ischemic burden [^116SypYQ]. Shared decision-making is essential [^114uX7Lz] given variable evidence on hard outcomes [^115PudDA] and the procedural risks [^114RPWfM].

---

## Medical management

Medical therapy is foundational for all CTO patients, aiming to **control symptoms**, **prevent progression**, and **reduce cardiovascular events** [^116dsKyA].

- **Antianginal medications**: Beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, long-acting nitrates, and ranolazine relieve angina and improve exercise tolerance [^notfound].

- **Risk factor modification**: Aggressive control of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and smoking cessation are critical [^notfound].

- **Antiplatelet therapy**: Aspirin and statins are standard to reduce cardiovascular events [^notfound].

Medical therapy alone is appropriate for asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic patients with low ischemic burden [^116qNV4p] or when revascularization is not feasible [^114HMdGw].

---

## Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)

PCI for CTO has advanced significantly, with **success rates of 85–90%** at experienced centers [^113bzory], though it carries higher complication rates than non-CTO PCI [^114RPWfM].

- **Indications**: Refractory angina despite OMT [^116qNV4p], documented large ischemic burden (≥ 10% of LV mass) [^116SypYQ], or viable myocardium in the CTO territory [^1135o4Gh].

- **Benefits**: Symptom relief [^116dsKyA], improved quality of life [^111SjmrJ], and potential reduction in subsequent CABG [^117VdxiW].

- **Risks**: Higher rates of perforation, periprocedural MI, radiation exposure, and contrast nephropathy [^114RPWfM] [^114uX7Lz].

- **Patient selection**: Favorable anatomy, experienced operators, and comprehensive preprocedural planning are essential [^117JwSQK] [^116BNxsb].

---

## Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG)

CABG remains a **key option** for CTO, particularly in complex multivessel disease or when PCI is not feasible [^1158ZqCj].

- **Indications**: Complex multivessel disease, left main disease, or failed PCI attempts [^1158ZqCj].

- **Benefits**: Complete revascularization, improved long-term survival, and reduced angina [^114DeiNJ].

- **Risks**: Surgical complications, longer recovery, and higher initial morbidity compared to PCI [^notfound].

---

## Emerging therapies and novel techniques

Recent advances include **improved PCI techniques** (antegrade dissection/reentry, retrograde approaches) [^116h8iAo], **enhanced imaging** (CT angiography, IVUS) [^112wH3EF], and **novel devices** (dedicated CTO wires, microcatheters, reentry systems) [^113bzory]. These innovations have increased PCI success and reduced complications, expanding treatment options for complex CTOs [^1142ZQyc].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing treatment choice

Treatment selection should be **individualized**, considering:

- **Clinical presentation**: Severity of angina, ischemic burden, and ventricular function [^1135o4Gh].

- **Anatomical factors**: Lesion complexity, collateral circulation, and presence of multivessel disease [^116vQunE].

- **Comorbidities**: Age, diabetes, renal function, and prior interventions [^111FEeg6].

- **Patient preferences**: Informed decision-making and shared decision-making are essential [^114uX7Lz].

---

## Current guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines emphasize **individualized care**:

- **ESC/EACTS guidelines**: Recommend PCI for refractory angina or large ischemic burden [^116qNV4p].

- **ACC/AHA guidelines**: State that the benefit of CTO PCI for symptom improvement is uncertain (Class IIb) [^114uX7Lz] [^111SeTk5].

- **Shared decision-making**: Strongly recommended given variable evidence on hard outcomes [^114uX7Lz].

---

## Long-term outcomes and prognosis

Long-term outcomes vary by strategy: medical therapy alone is associated with **persistent symptoms** and a higher risk of adverse events [^112FoQWe], successful PCI improves quality of life and may reduce long-term adverse events [^116dsKyA] [^1114q693], and CABG offers the most durable revascularization with improved survival in complex multivessel disease [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion

Management of CTO requires a **multidisciplinary approach**, balancing symptom relief, procedural risks, and long-term outcomes. OMT is foundational; PCI offers symptom relief in selected patients; CABG is preferred for complex multivessel disease. Emerging techniques and individualized care are key to optimizing outcomes [^111SjmrJ] [^116qNV4p] [^113z8We2] [^117XHFhf].

### Chronic total occlusion percutaneous coronary intervention: evidence and controversies [^1177Kg1Q]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Coronary chronic total occlusions (CTOs) are defined as 100% occlusions with TIMI (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction) 0 flow with at least a 3‐month duration. 1 Treatment options for patients with coronary CTOs include lifestyle changes and medications (as is appropriate for all patients with coronary artery disease) and coronary revascularization with either percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). In the previous version of the appropriateness use criteria for coronary revascularization, 2 revascularization recommendations were different for patients with and without a coronary CTO, but this is no longer the case in the current (2016 and 2017) versions. 3, 4

The goal of this review is to summarize the available evidence on the clinical benefits, likelihood of success, risk for complications, and crossing strategies for CTO PCI and provide practical clinical recommendations.

### Who should undergo chronic total occlusions percutaneous coronary intervention and when? an evidence-based approach to the patient referred for percutaneous coronary intervention of chronic total occlusion [^111K5hdi]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Chronic total occlusions (CTO) of the coronary arteries are common among patients presenting to the cardiac catheterization laboratory, and data suggests a worse overall prognosis in patients with CTOs. Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) of CTOs has been shown to improve anginal symptoms in observational studies and in a limited number of randomized trials. However, CTO PCI has not been shown to lead to a reduction in other important end points such as myocardial infarction or death. Furthermore, despite recent advances in the field, CTO PCI still carries higher risks and a lower likelihood of success compared with non-CTO PCI. Thus, determining which patients may be appropriate for CTO PCI is challenging and must involve a comprehensive risk-benefit analysis and discussion with the patient. Therefore, we review the currently available data regarding CTO PCI, including the clinical outcomes, the role of preprocedural ischemia testing, and various procedural success and risk stratification scores. Finally, we present our approach to the patient referred for CTO PCI.

### Contemporary overview and clinical perspectives of chronic total occlusions [^111x7wU7]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2014). Medium credibility.

Chronic total occlusions (CTOs) are often detected on diagnostic coronary angiograms, but percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for CTO is currently infrequently performed owing to high technical difficulty, perceived risk of complications, and a lack of randomized data. However, successful CTO-PCI can significantly increase a patient's quality of life, improve left ventricular function, reduce the need for subsequent CABG surgery, and possibly improve long-term survival. A number of factors must be taken into account for the selection of patients for CTO-PCI, including the extent of ischaemia surrounding the occlusion, the level of myocardial viability, coronary location of the CTO, and probability of procedural success. Moreover, in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, a CTO in a noninfarct-related artery might lead to an increase in infarct area, increased end-diastolic left ventricular pressure, and decreased left ventricular function, which are all associated with poor clinical outcomes. In this Review, we provide an overview of the anatomy and histopathology of CTOs, perceived benefits of CTO-PCI, considerations for patient selection for this procedure, and a summary of emerging techniques for CTO-PCI.

Treatment of chronic total occlusions

In 2019, the EuroCTO Club published a consensus document that summarizes the current evidence (Figure 1), discusses the indications for chronic total occlusion (CTO) revascularization, presents the advances in CTO equipment, and provides recommendations about training in CTO PCI. In line with the ESC guidelines on myocardial revascularization and taking into account the findings of randomized controlled studies, the EuroCTO Club recommends CTO recanalization in the presence of symptoms despite optimal medical therapy; in asymptomatic patients, ischaemic burden assessment is recommended and CTO revascularization is advised if there is evidence of increased ischaemic burden (≥ 10% of the left ventricular mass). These recommendation are in line with the findings of the recently reported Drug-Eluting Stent Implantation vs. Optimal Medical Treatment in Patients With Chronic Total Occlusion (DECISION-CTO) trial. In this study, 815 patients with a CTO were randomized in 1:1 ratio to complete revascularization or to the treatment of the obstructive non-CTO lesions whenever these were present. Only one-fourth of the patients included in the two groups had a single-vessel disease. At 4-year follow-up, there was no difference between the two groups for the combined endpoint of death, MI, stroke, or revascularization (22.4% vs. 22.3%, P = 0.86) or patients' quality of life. These findings indicate that in case of multivessel disease revascularization of the non-CTO lesion and re-evaluation of the extent of ischaemia and patient symptoms should be considered before advocating recanalization of a CTO. Limitations of the study — the largest of its kind — included the high crossover rate (19.6%) from the non-CTO PCI group to the CTO-PCI group within the first days from randomization as well the fact that it was underpowered for the primary endpoint as patient recruitment was early terminated because of a slow enrolment rate.

### Update in the percutaneous management of coronary chronic total occlusions [^112Hfx4D]. JACC: Cardiovascular Interventions (2018). Low credibility.

Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for chronic total occlusions (CTOs) has been rapidly evolving during recent years. With improvement in equipment and techniques, high success rates can be achieved at experienced centers, although overall success rates remain low. Prospective, randomized-controlled data regarding optimal use and indications for CTO PCI remain limited. CTO PCI should be performed when the anticipated benefit exceeds the potential risk. New high-quality studies of the clinical outcomes and techniques of CTO PCI are needed, as is the expansion of expert centers and operators that can achieve excellent clinical outcomes in this challenging patient and lesion subgroup. In the current review the authors summarize the latest publications in CTO PCI and provide an overview of the current state of the field.

### Wanted: expert operators for coronary chronic total occlusion interventions [^113bKYbU]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2018). Low credibility.

Coronary chronic total occlusions can be recanalized by expert operators with high success and acceptable complication rates. Developing a procedural plan (using the hybrid or another algorithm) is critical for success. Live case demonstrations appear safe and can be of high educational value. The key factor for achieving good outcomes in chronic total occlusion interventions remains operator expertise. Development of more expert operators will improve the treatment options for this challenging group of lesions and patients.

### Appropriateness of percutaneous revascularization of coronary chronic total occlusions: an overview [^113F5wPA]. European Heart Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Coronary chronic total occlusions (CTOs) are commonly encountered in patients undergoing coronary angiography. Several observational studies have demonstrated that successful CTO revascularization is associated with better cardiovascular outcomes and enhanced quality of life (QOL). However, in the absence of randomized trials, its prognostic benefit for patients remains debated. Over the past decade, the interest of the interventional community in CTO percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has exponentially grown due to important developments in dedicated equipment and techniques, resulting in high success and low complication rates. Both European and American guidelines have assigned a class IIa (level of evidence B) recommendation for CTO PCI. In the current review, we focus on the impact of CTO revascularization on clinical outcomes and QOL and on appropriate patient selection, and we provide a critical assessment of the current guidelines and recommendations on CTO PCI.

### Revascularization of chronic total occlusions: time to reconsider? [^115YV21a]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Up to 20% of all coronary angiograms reveal coronary chronic total occlusions (CTOs). The lack of robust type A evidence with hard clinical outcomes on the benefits of CTO revascularization has hampered attempts to develop recommendations regarding the optimal management of CTOs. This review presents issues surrounding CTO revascularization within the framework of the appropriate use criteria ratings. Appropriate use criteria ratings downgrade CTO percutaneous coronary intervention revascularization relative to non-CTOs and to surgical revascularization. Specific aspects of CTO revascularization include ischemic burden, impact of revascularization on quality of life, risks in CTO revascularization, and the importance of complete revascularization. Contemporary data suggest CTO revascularization may have substantial impact on patient outcomes; thus, revascularization should likely be held to similar criteria as nonocclusive lesions. However, additional large clinical trial data are required to more definitively determine CTO revascularization guidelines.

### Randomized trial evaluating percutaneous coronary intervention for the treatment of chronic total occlusion [^115PudDA]. Circulation (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Procedural results for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in coronary vessels with chronic total occlusion (CTO) have improved in recent years, and PCI strategies have moved toward more complete revascularization with more liberal use of CTO-PCI. However, evidence evaluating CTO-PCI is limited to observational studies and small clinical trials.

Methods

In this open-label, multicenter, randomized, noninferiority trial, PCI-eligible patients were assigned to receive either 1 of 2 strategies: PCI or no PCI for the qualifying de novo CTO lesion with the option for PCI of obstructive non-CTO lesions at the discretion of the operator. The primary end point was a composite of death, myocardial infarction, stroke, or any revascularization. Health-related quality of life was assessed at baseline and at 1, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months. Because of slow recruitment, the trial was stopped before completion of the 1284 planned enrollments.

Results

Between March 2010 and September 2016, 834 patients were randomly assigned to the CTO-PCI (n = 417) or no CTO-PCI (n = 398) strategy. Among the patients assigned to the no CTO-PCI strategy, 78 (19.6%) crossed over to receive staged CTO-PCI within 3 days of randomization. The overall CTO-PCI success rate was 90.6%. Serious nonfatal complications associated with CTO-PCI occurred in 3 patients (1 stroke, 1 cardiac tamponade, and 1 patient with recurrent episodes of ventricular tachyarrhythmia induced by intracoronary thrombus). Approximately half of the patients in each group underwent PCI for an average of 1.3 non-CTO lesions, resulting in a comparable residual SYNTAX score (Synergy Between PCI With TAXUS and Cardiac Surgery; 3.7 ± 5.4 versus 4.0 ± 5.9, P = 0.42) confined to non-CTO vessels. During a median follow-up of 4.0 years (interquartile range, 2.4 to 5.1 years), there was no significant difference between the CTO-PCI and the no CTO-PCI strategies in the incidence of the primary end point (22.3% versus 22.4%, hazard ratio, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.77 to 1.37; P = 0.86). Both CTO-PCI and no CTO-PCI strategy were associated with significant improvements but without between-group differences in disease-specific health status that was sustained through 36 months.

Conclusions

CTO-PCI was feasible with high success rates. There was no difference in the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events with CTO-PCI versus no CTO-PCI, but the study was limited by low power for clinical end points and high crossover rates between groups.

### Scores for chronic total occlusion percutaneous coronary intervention: a window to the future? [^116uDmqi]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Because of the conflicting results of the aforementioned trials, the 2021 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association/Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions guidelines for coronary artery revascularization downgraded the recommendation for CTO PCI to class IIb (level of evidence B): "In patients with suitable anatomy who have refractory angina on medical therapy, after treatment of non‐CTO lesions, the benefit of PCI of a CTO to improve symptoms is uncertain". In contrast, CTO PCI is given a class IIa (level of evidence B) recommendation for CTO PCI in the 2018 European Society of Cardiology/European Association for Cardiothoracic Surgery coronary revascularization guidelines: "Percutaneous revascularization of CTOs should be considered in patients with angina resistant to medical therapy or with a large area of documented ischemia in the territory of the occluded vessel".

### Contemporary principles of coronary chronic total occlusion recanalization [^1111P8wA]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2010). Low credibility.

Successful recanalization and percutaneous revascularization of coronary arteries with chronic total occlusion (CTO) is one of the "last frontiers" in coronary interventions. Conquering this objective may enable complete percutaneous revascularization in an increasing number of patients. Revascularization of CTOs carries multiple theoretical advantages such as improvement in wall motion abnormalities and left ventricular function, and ultimately, increased long-term survival. In the long term, when coronary disease progresses, having an open artery may increase the tolerance to future coronary events. The contemporary principles of the recanalization technique are reviewed.

### Definitions and clinical trial design principles for coronary artery chronic total occlusion therapies: CTO-ARC consensus recommendations [^1162DnWH]. Circulation (2021). Medium credibility.

Over the past 2 decades, chronic total occlusion (CTO) percutaneous coronary intervention has developed into its own subspecialty of interventional cardiology. Dedicated terminology, techniques, devices, courses, and training programs have enabled progressive advancements. However, only a few randomized trials have been performed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of CTO percutaneous coronary intervention. Moreover, several published observational studies have shown conflicting data. Part of the paucity of clinical data stems from the fact that prior studies have been suboptimally designed and performed. The absence of standardized end points and the discrepancy in definitions also prevent consistency and uniform interpretability of reported results in CTO intervention. To standardize the field, we therefore assembled a broad consortium comprising academicians, practicing physicians, researchers, medical society representatives, and regulators (US Food and Drug Administration) to develop methods, end points, biomarkers, parameters, data, materials, processes, procedures, evaluations, tools, and techniques for CTO interventions. This article summarizes the effort and is organized into 3 sections: key elements and procedural definitions, end point definitions, and clinical trial design principles. The Chronic Total Occlusion Academic Research Consortium is a first step toward improved comparability and interpretability of study results, supplying an increasingly growing body of CTO percutaneous coronary intervention evidence.

### Prognostic benefit of the target vessel in revascularization of chronic total occluded coronary arteries: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112H4wrD]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Background

Approximately 16%−31% of patients with chronic coronary syndromes (CCS) undergoing coronary angiography have a chronic total occlusion (CTO). Revascularization is indicated if symptoms persist despite optimal medical treatment (OMT). CTO lesions are difficult to treat and prone to complications in relation to the PCI procedure. Identifying CTO subgroups for optimal treatment selection is valuable. It has been debated if the symptomatic and prognostic effect of PCI is better than OMT alone. An ongoing international randomized controlled trial (RCT) is seeking to investigate this further. Failed CTO PCI is associated with worse mortality and symptom reduction than successful in observational studies. However, several RCTs challenge this hypothesis and reported no difference between successful CTO PCI and risk of adverse events. Successful CTO PCI in the left anterior descending artery (LAD) may possibly have a greater impact on reducing mortality than in the right coronary artery (RCA) and left circumflex artery (LCX). Consequently, there could be distinct criteria for revascularization in patients with CTO in LAD, RCA, or LCX. This systematic review and meta‐analysis aimed to examine whether long‐term mortality following CTO revascularization with PCI is influenced by the CTO target vessel.

### Percutaneous recanalization of chronic total occlusions: wherein lies the body of proof? [^113MjPwk]. American Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Although interventional technology and skills have markedly advanced, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for coronary chronic total occlusion (CTO) lesions remains challenging. Indeed, CTO PCI is technically complex, carries the potential for a relatively high likelihood of failure and acute complications, and requires specifically skilled operators and a demanding use of resources. In addition, controversy persists surrounding appropriate indications for attempting CTO revascularization. Finally, there is a wide uncertainty on the actual benefits achieved with successful CTO recanalization. A growing number of studies have reported procedural results and/or assessed functional effects and long-term clinical outcomes of CTO PCI. We therefore sought to review and critically appraise the evidence base for procedural outcomes and potential clinical benefits of CTO PCI.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for coronary artery disease, more specifically with respect to technical considerations for PCI (chronic total occlusion), EACTS/ESC 2019 guidelines recommend to consider performing percutaneous revascularization of chronic total occlusions in patients with angina resistant to medical therapy or with a large area of documented ischemia in the territory of the occluded vessel.

### Current perspectives on coronary chronic total occlusions: the Canadian multicenter chronic total occlusions registry [^115GSfXt]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence, clinical characteristics, and management of coronary chronic total occlusions (CTOs) in current practice.

Background

There is little evidence in contemporary literature concerning the prevalence, clinical characteristics, and treatment decisions regarding patients who have coronary CTOs identified during coronary angiography.

Methods

Consecutive patients undergoing nonurgent coronary angiography with CTO were prospectively identified at 3 Canadian sites from April 2008 to July 2009. Patients with previous coronary artery bypass graft surgery or presenting with acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction were excluded. Detailed baseline clinical, angiographic, electrocardiographic, and revascularization data were collected.

Results

Chronic total occlusions were identified in 1,697 (18.4%) patients with significant coronary artery disease (> 50% stenosis in ≥ 1 coronary artery) who were undergoing nonemergent angiography. Previous history of myocardial infarction was documented in 40% of study patients, with electrocardiographic evidence of Q waves corresponding to the CTO artery territory in only 26% of cases. Left ventricular function was normal in > 50% of patients with CTO. Half the CTOs were located in the right coronary artery. Almost half the patients with CTO were treated medically, and 25% underwent coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CTO bypassed in 88%). Percutaneous coronary intervention was done in 30% of patients, although CTO lesions were attempted in only 10% (with 70% success rate).

Conclusions

Chronic total occlusions are common in contemporary catheterization laboratory practice. Prospective studies are needed to ascertain the benefits of treatment strategies of these complex patients.

### Health status outcomes in older adults undergoing chronic total occlusion percutaneous coronary intervention [^112e4HUs]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Chronic total occlusions (CTOs) are common in older adults with coronary artery disease, with prior studies reporting a prevalence of nearly 4 in 10 patients aged > 65 years. Given an aging US population, better understanding the management of patients with these complex lesions is of critical importance. Older age remains one of the most significant risk factors for adverse events after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), and older patients are more likely to have multiple comorbidities, coronary calcification, and frailty which also increases the risk of poor outcomes. Contemporary studies of clinical outcomes in adults aged ≥ 75 years undergoing CTO PCI have demonstrated lower technical success and higher in‐hospital major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) as compared with adults aged < 75 years; however, there are limited data on health status outcomes after treatment — patients' symptoms, physical function, and quality of life (QOL). The EURO‐CTO trial (Randomized Multicentre Trial to Evaluate the Utilization of Revascularization or Optimal Medical Therapy for the Treatment of Chronic Total Coronary Occlusions), the only randomized study to find a health status benefit with CTO PCI, randomized 396 participants (mean age 65.2 years) 2:1 to CTO PCI versus medical therapy, but only roughly 16% of participants were ≥ 75 years, limiting generalizability to older adults. In light of increased procedural risks and uncertain health status benefits among older patients, it is critical to understand if older adults derive comparable symptom relief as younger adults as they may be less likely to undergo CTO PCI than younger adults in routine practice.

For older adults, QOL and functional independence may be a much more significant priority than longevity when considering treatment options. The decision to undergo CTO PCI may be particularly compelling for many older patients if symptoms, physical functioning, and QOL are likely to significantly improve; however, the impact of CTO PCI on these important patient‐centered outcomes has not been studied among older adults. To address this knowledge gap, we leveraged the OPEN‐CTO (Outcomes, Patient Health Status, and Efficiency in Chronic Total Occlusion Hybrid Procedures) registry to quantify health status outcomes after CTO PCI using the Seattle Angina Questionnaire (SAQ) and Rose Dyspnea Scale (RDS). We also compared rates of technical success and procedural complications in older versus younger participants undergoing CTO PCI. Quantifying older patients' health status outcomes after CTO‐PCI will provide essential insights to help clinicians better convey the expected risks and benefits of treatment and improve the shared decision‐making process in this increasingly important population.

### Treatment of refractory angina in patients not suitable for revascularization [^114HMdGw]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2014). Medium credibility.

A growing number of patients, particularly those with advanced, chronic coronary artery disease, experience symptoms of angina that are refractory to treatment with β-blockers, calcium-channel blockers, and long-acting nitrates, despite revascularization. The management of patients with refractory angina who are unsuitable for further revascularization is strikingly different across the world, and is contingent on local resources and available expertise. Mortality in this patient population has decreased, but enhancing quality of life remains a challenge. New treatment principles are emerging in current practice, such as metabolic modulation, therapeutic angiogenesis, and novel interventional techniques (coronary in-flow redistribution and approaches to chronic total occlusion). The contemporary management of refractory angina encourages individualized, patient-centred care in interdisciplinary, specialized clinics. Global initiatives are required to address complex clinical problem-solving for patients with refractory angina. In this Review, we discuss the epidemiology of refractory angina, and provide an update on the pharmacological, noninvasive, and interventional options that are available to these patients or are under development.

### A percutaneous treatment algorithm for crossing coronary chronic total occlusions [^114wEv4e]. JACC: Cardiovascular Interventions (2012). Low credibility.

Coronary chronic total occlusions (CTOs) are frequently identified during coronary angiography and remain the most challenging lesion group to treat. Patients with CTOs are frequently left unrevascularized due to perceptions of high failure rates and technical complexity even if they have symptoms of coronary disease or ischemia. In this review, the authors describe a North American contemporary approach for percutaneous coronary interventions for CTO. Two guide catheters are placed to facilitate seamless transition between antegrade wire-based, antegrade dissection re-entry-based, and retrograde (wire or dissection re-entry) techniques, the "hybrid" interventional strategy. After dual coronary injection is performed, 4 angiographic parameters are assessed: 1) clear understanding of location of the proximal cap using angiography or intravascular ultrasonography; 2) lesion length; 3) presence of branches, as well as size and quality of the target vessel at the distal cap; and 4) suitability of collaterals for retrograde techniques. On the basis of these 4 characteristics, an initial strategy and rank order hierarchy for technical approaches is established. Radiation exposure, contrast utilization, and procedure time are monitored throughout the procedure, and thresholds are established for intraprocedural strategy conversion to maximize safety, efficiency, and effectiveness.

### Effect of chronic total coronary occlusion on treatment strategy [^111xP8fM]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

In a registry analysis of 8,004 consecutive patients presenting for diagnostic catheterization at a single institution from 1990 to 2000, chronic total occlusion (CTO) was found in 52% of patients with significant (≥ 70% diameter stenosis) coronary artery disease. Peripheral vascular disease was the strongest clinical predictor of the presence of a CTO. In a multivariate analysis, CTO was the strongest predictor against the selection of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) as a treatment strategy, indicating that efforts to improve the success rate of PCI in CTO may have a significant impact on management of coronary disease.

### International randomized trial on the effect of revascularization or optimal medical therapy of chronic total coronary occlusions with myocardial ischemia-ISCHEMIA-CTO trial-rationale and design [^114JVjmp]. American Heart Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic total occlusions (CTO) are frequent among patients with coronary artery disease. Revascularization with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is safe and feasible in experienced hands. However, randomized data are needed to demonstrate symptomatic as well as prognostic effect of CTO-PCI compared to optimal medical therapy alone.

Methods

This trial aims to evaluate the effect of CTO PCI in patients with a CTO lesion and target vessel diameter ≥ 2.5 mm, and myocardial ischemia in the relevant territory. First, all patients are subjected to optimal medical therapy (OMT) for at least for 3 months and non-CTO lesions are managed according to guidelines. Subsequently, prior to randomization myocardial ischemia and quality of life (Seattle Questionnaire (SAQ)) is assessed. Patients are divided into two cohorts based on their SAQ score and randomized to either OMT alone or OMT and CTO-PCI. Cohort A is defined as Low- or asymptomatic patients with a quality-of-life score > 60 and/or CCS class < 2, and more than 10% ischemia in the left ventricle (LV). Cohort B is symptomatic patients with a quality-of-life score < 60 or CCS class angina > 1 and at least ischemia in 5% of the LV. The primary end-point in cohort A is a composite of major adverse cardiac and cerebral events, hospitalization for heart failure and malignant ventricular arrhythmias. The primary endpoint in cohort B is difference in quality of life 6 months after randomization.

Implications

This trial is designed to investigate if CTO-PCI improves QoL and MACCE. Both positive and negative outcome of the trial will affect future guidelines and recommendations on how to treat patients with CTO.

### Update on chronic total occlusion percutaneous coronary intervention [^1142ZQyc]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Chronic total occlusion (CTO) percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) can be challenging to perform. The main indication for CTO PCI is to improve symptoms. Several contemporary studies have reported high CTO PCI success rates at experienced centers but success rates in all-comer registries remain low. Several scores can estimate the difficulty and the likelihood of success of CTO PCI. Dual arterial access and use of CTO crossing algorithms can improve the success and safety of CTO PCI. Intracoronary imaging can optimize stent expansion and minimize adverse cardiovascular events. While complications are more common in CTO PCI, careful planning and prompt diagnosis and treatment can prevent them or minimize their adverse consequences. In this article, we review contemporary data on the indications, safety and efficacy of CTO PCI.

### Scores for chronic total occlusion percutaneous coronary intervention: a window to the future? [^113KgdP8]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

BENEFITS

Symptom relief is currently the main indication for CTO PCI. Several observational studies and 3, of 4randomized‐controlled trials showed symptom improvement with CTO PCI compared with optimal medical therapy (OMT) alone. In the EuroCTO (randomized multicenter trial to compare revascularization with OMT for the treatment of chronic total coronary occlusions) trial, 396 patients were randomized to OMT versus OMT+PCI. At 12 months, patients who underwent CTO PCI had greater improvements in angina frequency, quality of life, and physical limitation, as assessed by Seattle Angina Questionnaire. In the Impactor‐CTO (Impact on Inducible Myocardial Ischemia of Percutaneous Coronary Intervention Versus Optimal Medical Therapy in Patients With Right Coronary Artery Chronic Total Occlusion) trial, 94 patients with angina and isolated dominant right coronary artery CTOs were randomized to OMT versus OMT+PCI. At 12 months, the CTO PCI group had significantly lower myocardial ischemia burden, improved 6‐minute walk distance, and improved health, as assessed by the 36‐Item Short Form Survey. In the COMET‐CTO (Randomized Controlled Comparison of Optimal Medical Therapy With Percutaneous Recanalization of Chronic Total Occlusion) trial, 100 patients were randomized to OMT versus OMT+PCI; at 9‐month follow‐up, patients who underwent CTO PCI had significantly improved physical limitation, angina, treatment satisfaction, and quality of life, whereas the OMT only group had no change in symptoms. The DECISION‐CTO (Drug‐Eluting Stent Implantation Versus Optimal Medical Treatment in Patients With Chronic Total Occlusion) trial randomized 834 patients to CTO PCI versus no CTO PCI and found no difference in quality of life or in the incidence of major adverse cardiac events during a median follow‐up of 4 years. However, the DECISION‐CTO trial had several limitations, such as mild baseline symptoms, concomitant PCI of non‐CTO lesions, and 20% crossover from no CTO PCI to CTO PCI within 3 days of randomization, that hinder interpretation of the study findings.

### The indications and utility of adjunctive imaging modalities for chronic total occlusion (CTO) intervention [^113xFn2b]. Journal of Nuclear Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Coronary chronic total occlusions (CTO) are common in patients undergoing coronary angiography, yet the optimal management strategy remains uncertain, with conflicting results from randomized trials. Appropriate patient selection and careful periprocedural planning are imperative for successful patient management. We review the role of adjunctive imaging modalities including myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI), cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR), echocardiography and computed tomography coronary angiography (CTCA) in myocardial ischemic quantification, myocardial viability assessment, as well as procedural planning for CTO revascularization. An appreciation of the value, indications and limitations of these modalities prior to planned intervention are essential for optimal management.

### Association of successful percutaneous revascularization of chronic total occlusions with quality of life: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116dsKyA]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Chronic total occlusion (CTO) is reported in 15% to 25% of patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD). In daily clinical practice, the majority of patients with CTO are treated with optimal medical therapy (OMT), according to the current guidelines, which target (1) angina symptom reduction and (2) prevention of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). Traditionally, CTO represents 1 of the most challenging lesion subsets in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), and CTO-PCI has been associated with low success rates and high complication rates. Despite the advancements in strategies, materials, and the remarkable dedication of experienced operators, the legacy of earlier procedural failures still plagues the dissemination of percutaneous revascularization, with less than 10% of all CTOs being approached with PCI. One of the main obstacles to broader adoption of CTO-PCI is the absence of robust evidence on the benefits of this treatment. Landmark studies in patients with CTO have suggested no difference in mortality between patients treated with PCI compared with OMT, although randomized trials searching for hard outcomes of CTO-PCI are strongly hampered by selection bias and low enrollment. Recently, American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association/Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions 2021 Coronary Revascularization Guideline's class of recommendation on CTO treatment has been downgraded from IIA to IIB based on 2 randomized trials showing no improvement in left ventricle function following revascularization with a neutral effect on hard outcomes.

There is general agreement that the primary benefit of revascularization in chronic coronary syndromes is symptomatic improvement, convincingly confirmed using the Seattle Angina Questionnaire (SAQ)in a substudy of the ISCHEMIA trial, otherwise perceived as a negative trial in terms of hard clinical outcomes for revascularization. In addition, quality of life scales are generally accepted as critical patient-reported outcome metrics for evaluating interventions in stable CAD. Demonstrating comparable symptom relief and quality of life improvement with percutaneous CTO treatment can support the reappraisal of the class of recommendation and underscore the potential of CTO-PCI revascularization to improve patients' health status.

A recent review article studied patients' quality of life (QoL) following CTO revascularization and reported a trend of improvement in QoL indices. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis including all available trials assessing the life quality using validated SAQ metrics to test whether successful CTO-PCI is associated with improved quality of life.

### Chronic total occlusion is not a risk factor for mortality in patients with successful percutaneous coronary intervention: a Cohort study [^117M32hZ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the leading cause of worldwide mortality and morbidity. Fifteen percent of patients with CAD present with at least one chronic total occluded coronary artery. Revascularization of a chronic total occlusion (CTO) with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) requires meticulous procedural planning and experienced physicians to ensure few complications and high success rates.EURO CTO (Randomized Multicentre Trial Comparing Revascularization and Optimal Medical Therapy for Chronic Total Coronary Occlusion) demonstrated that PCI plus optimal medical therapy (OMT) provided beneficial effects on symptom relief and quality of life for patients with CTO compared with OMT alone. Also, prognostic benefits of CTO PCI have been suggested by multiple observational studies comparing patients with successful versus unsuccessful CTO PCI, hypothesizing that unopened CTOs lead to a larger area of myocardium at risk and thereby a worse prognosis. Nevertheless, the only randomized trial investigating the prognosis after CTO PCI, the DECISION‐CTO (Drug‐Eluting Stent Implantation Versus Optimal Medical Treatment in Patients With Chronic Total Occlusion) trial, yielded neutral results similar to ISCHEMIA (International Study of Comparative Health Effectiveness With Medical and Invasive Approaches) and COURAGE (Clinical Outcomes Utilizing Revascularization and Aggressive Drug Evaluation) trial, which primarily investigated patients with non‐CTO. High crossover rates and premature stop of inclusion in the DECISION‐CTO trial limited the results, and determining a potential prognostic effect of CTO PCI treatment remains for future trials. Despite neutral trial outcomes, higher long‐term mortality has been observed in patients with CTO compared with patients with non‐CTO CAD. This difference could be attributed to a higher prevalence of comorbidities, risk factors, multivessel CAD, or bias caused by unsuccessful revascularized or unattempted CTO lesions. The aim of this study was to compare all‐cause mortality among patients who underwent successful and unsuccessful CTO PCI with those who underwent PCI for non‐CTO lesions. This paper is reported in accordance with the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) statement.

### Viability and functional recovery after chronic total occlusion percutaneous coronary intervention [^1135o4Gh]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2021). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Chronic coronary total occlusions (CTO) are diagnosed in approximately 20% of patients with coronary artery disease. Technical developments and increase in success rates in CTO percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) have brought attention to CTO revascularization as a potentially valuable treatment option. International guidelines recommend viability assessment next to evaluation of symptoms and ischemia detection to establish judicious patient selection for CTO PCI. Nevertheless, contradictory findings have been previously reported regarding the association of myocardial viability testing and functional and prognostic improvements after revascularization. Increase in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) after CTO revascularization is often found to be modest (< 5%), whereas a few studies demonstrated higher increases in LVEF after viability assessment. Downsides of these studies are their small sample size, suboptimal non‐invasive imaging modalities, a lack of functional reassessment after a fixed duration of time after revascularization, or an imprecise definition of myocardial viability. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging is a non‐invasive imaging technique that is considered the reference standard for evaluation of myocardial function and infarction. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the extent of viability before and functional recovery 3 months after successful PCI in a large CTO population using sequential quantitative CMR imaging.

### Effects of percutaneous revascularization of chronic total occlusions on clinical outcomes: a meta-analysis comparing successful versus failed percutaneous intervention for chronic total occlusion [^117VdxiW]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic total occlusions (CTOs) represent the most complex and challenging coronary lesions for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). PCI for a CTO is a high-risk procedure and the long-term benefits of a successful percutaneous CTO recanalization over the medical management (as a result of failed PCI) are not clear, as the studies have shown conflicting results in the past. The goal of this analysis was to clarify this issue by performing a meta-analysis of the available literature.

Methods

Using major electronic databases, we searched for studies (randomized or observational) comparing death, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), myocardial infarction (MI), and target vessel revascularization (TVR) between patients who underwent PCI recanalization of CTOs versus those treated with medical management as a result of failed PCI attempts.

Results

We identified 23 observational studies comparing the desired clinical parameters between patients with successful CTO recanalization and those managed conservatively as a result of attempted but failed PCI. The total number of patients observed in all of the studies was 12,970 and the mean time of follow up was 3.7 ± 2.1 years. Our results indicated that successful recanalization of a CTO results in improved all-cause mortality (relative risk [RR] of 0.54, 95% confidence interval [CI] (0.45–0.65), P-value < 0.001), lower rates of MACE (RR of 0.70, 95% CI 0.60–0.83, P-value < 0.001) and reduced needs for subsequent bypass surgery (RR of 0.25, 95% CI (0.21–0.30), P-value < 0.001). The difference in long-term mortality remained statistically significant even after the adjustment for procedure related complications and in-hospital deaths.

Conclusion

As compared to conservative management (as a result of failed intervention), successful PCI recanalization of a CTO appears to be associated with improved long-term clinical outcomes; however, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are needed to further confirm these results.

### Meta-analysis of the effect of percutaneous coronary intervention on chronic total coronary occlusions [^112gufcC]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Coronary chronic total occlusion (CTO) is the last stage of coronary artery atherosclerosis, accounting for one third of the disease confirmed by coronary angiography. CTO exists in about 50% of patients with coronary artery disease, which is often accompanied by complex lesions, in about 15% patients as reported, revealed by coronary angiography. This disease can result in myocardium ischemia, myocardiolysis, reduction of the number of myocardial cells, ventricular remodeling which lead to decreased myocardium contractile, reduction of quality of life and poor prognosis. Medication alone for CTO treatment does reduce the clinical symptom, but it has little effect on the long-term heart function and the improvement of the patients' survival rate. Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is a therapeutic procedure not only used to recanalize vessels with total occlusion, but also widely used in other aspects such as increase blood flow reperfusion, improve myocardial contractile and pump function, inhibit left ventricular remodeling and decrease adverse cardiac events. However, PCI is considered not suitable for CTO lesions because of the lack in strong backup support by the guiding catheters or the difficulty in taking the contralateral coronary angiograms. The success rate of CTO patients by PCI procedure is lower than that in non-CTO patients. Revascularization for CTO lesions is more difficult and influenced by baseline clinical characteristics, lesions level, intervention equipments and the manipulation techniques. With the development of interventional technologies and physician's manipulation techniques, the successful rate of PCI procedure on CTO lesions is significantly increased. However, CTO recanalization is still accepted as an extremely challenging procedure in cardiovascular PCI treatments.

The success of the recanalization for CTO in coronary interventions is vital. However, the long-term outcomes such as cumulative survival rate, major adverse cardiac events (MACE), incidence of restenosis and reocclusion are still under debate based on different procedures and techniques. Therefore, it is critical to scientifically evaluate the effectiveness and influential factors for CTO interventional treatment.

In this study, publications on PCI procedure in CTO patients were systematically reviewed and suggested potential influential factors that influenced successful rate and outcomes for PCI procedure.

### Animal chronic total occlusion models: a review of the current literature and future goals [^115sbkaz]. Thrombosis Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Coronary chronic total occlusions (CTOs) are commonly found in patients undergoing coronary angiography and is associated with poorer prognosis than in those patients with other forms of stable coronary artery disease. As such, with an increasing appreciation of this clinical entity, there is a need to identify, firstly the pathophysiological process driving its formation, as well as new percutaneous strategies for revascularisation with long term durability and improved outcomes. An appropriate, reliable and reproducible animal model is vital for both of these objectives. We review the prevalence of spontaneous collaterals in different species, as well as review the current literature with respect to animal models of CTOs, and compare and contrast the advantages and disadvantages of these differing models. Whilst both extrinsic compression models and endoluminal procedures may create situations analogous to a CTO in a human, the ideal animal model of a CTO will include an occluded artery, functional collaterals and a viable myocardium. This would allow study of the process driving collateral formation and arteriogenesis as well as percutaneous intervention strategies for both acute and long term benefits.

### Contemporary issues in chronic total Occlusion percutaneous Coronary intervention [^113oQQT5]. JACC: Cardiovascular Interventions (2022). Medium credibility.

Remarkable progress has been achieved in chronic total occlusion (CTO) percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in recent years, with refinement of the indications and technical aspects of the procedure, imaging, and complication management. Randomized controlled trials and rigorous prospective registries have provided high-quality data on the benefits and risks of CTO PCI. Global collaboration has led to an agreement on nomenclature, indications, endpoint definition, and principles of clinical trial design that have been distilled in global consensus documents such as the CTO Academic Research Consortium. Increased use of preprocedural coronary computed tomography angiography and intraprocedural intravascular imaging, as well as development of novel techniques and structured CTO crossing and complication management algorithms, allow a systematic, stepwise approach to this difficult lesion subset. This state-of-the-art review provides a comprehensive discussion about the most recent developments in the indications, preprocedural planning, technical aspects, complication management, and future directions of CTO PCI.

Chronic total occlusions subtend a more extensive perfusion defect size compared to non-chronic total occlusion lesions. Chronic total occlusion percutaneous coronary intervention (CTO PCI) results in significant improvement in myocardial blood flow and reduction in perfusion defect size. Improvement in hyperemic myocardial blood Flow (MBF), coronary flow reserve (CFR) and perfusion defect size is comparable in CTO and hemodynamically significant non-CTO PCI.

### Late survival benefit of percutaneous coronary intervention compared with medical therapy in patients with coronary chronic total occlusion: a 10-year follow-up study [^111Nb9We]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Coronary chronic total occlusion (CTO) is frequent during coronary angiography. 1 However, CTO percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has been performed infrequently and is technically challenging despite recent advancements in interventional equipment and innovative approaches to cross CTO lesions. 2 The key barrier limiting transition of CTO‐PCI to conventional procedure is lack of randomized trial–derived evidence to support its use. 3 Two randomized trials involving CTO‐PCI versus optimal medical therapy (OMT) were recently performed: the DECISION‐CTO (Drug‐Eluting Stent Implantation Versus Optimal Medical Treatment in Patients With Chronic Total Occlusion) trial and EUROCTO (A Randomized Multicentre Trial to Evaluate the Utilization of Revascularization or Optimal Medical Therapy for the Treatment of Chronic Total Occlusions). However, the DECISION‐CTO trial and EURO‐CTO did not demonstrate an improvement in major cardiac cerebrovascular events up to 3 years. 4, 5 Both trials had several limitations including underpowered sample size, midterm follow‐up, and selection of low‐risk population. Therefore, a study utilizing a large sample size, long‐term follow‐up, and enrollment of consecutive patients is needed to explore the difference between CTO‐PCI and OMT. We sought to evaluate the benefit of CTO‐PCI compared with OMT through extended long‐term follow‐up of a dedicated CTO registry.

### Effectiveness of recanalization of chronic total occlusions: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115uWaxx]. American Heart Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic total occlusion (CTO) recanalizations remain extremely challenging procedures. With improvements in technology and techniques, success rates for recanalization of CTO continue to improve. However, the clinical benefits of this practice remain unclear. The aim of the study was to determine the effectiveness of CTO recanalization on clinical outcomes.

Methods

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of published studies comparing CTO recanalization to medical management. Data were extracted in duplicate and analyzed by a random effects model.

Results

We did not identify any randomized controlled trials or observational studies comparing CTO recanalization to a planned medical management. We did identify 13 observational studies comparing outcomes after successful vs failed CTO recanalization attempt. These studies encompassed 7,288 patients observed over a weighted average follow-up of 6 years. There were 721 (14.3%) deaths of 5,056 patients after successful CTO recanalization compared to 390 deaths (17.5%) of 2,232 patients after failed CTO recanalization (odds ratio [OR] 0.56, 95% CI 0.43–0.72). Successful recanalization was associated with a significant reduction in subsequent coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) (OR 0.22, 95% CI 0.17–0.27) but not in myocardial infarction (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.44–1.25) or major adverse cardiac events (OR 0.81, 95% CI 0.55–1.21). In the 6 studies that reported angina status, successful recanalization was associated with a significant reduction in residual/recurrent angina (OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.30–0.67).

Conclusions

In highly selected patients considered for CTO recanalization, successful attempts appear to be associated with an improvement in mortality and with a reduction for the need for CABG as compared to failed recanalization. However, given the observational nature of the reviewed evidence, randomized clinical trials are needed to confirm these findings.

### A randomized multicentre trial to compare revascularization with optimal medical therapy for the treatment of chronic total coronary occlusions [^111SjmrJ]. European Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Aims

The clinical value of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for chronic coronary total occlusions (CTOs) is not established by randomized trials. This study should compare the benefit of PCI vs. optimal medical therapy (OMT) on the health status in patients with at least one CTO.

Method and Results

Three hundred and ninety-six patients were enrolled in a prospective randomized, multicentre, open-label, and controlled clinical trial to compare the treatment by PCI with OMT with a 2:1 randomization ratio. The primary endpoint was the change in health status assessed by the Seattle angina questionnaire (SAQ) between baseline and 12months follow-up. Fifty-two percent of patients have multi-vessel disease in whom all significant non-occlusive lesions were treated before randomization. An intention-to-treat analysis was performed including 13.4% failed procedures in the PCI group and 7.3% cross-overs in the OMT group. At 12months, a greater improvement of SAQ subscales was observed with PCI as compared with OMT for angina frequency [5.23, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.75; 8.71; P = 0.003], and quality of life (6.62, 95% CI 1.78–11.46; P = 0.007), reaching the prespecified significance level of 0.01 for the primary endpoint. Physical limitation (P = 0.02) was also improved in the PCI group. Complete freedom from angina was more frequent with PCI 71.6% than OMT 57.8% (P = 0.008). There was no periprocedural death or myocardial infarction. At 12months, major adverse cardiac events were comparable between the two groups.

Conclusion

Percutaneous coronary intervention leads to a significant improvement of the health status in patients with stable angina and a CTO as compared with OMT alone.

### Coronary chronic total occlusion on coronary CT angiography: what radiologists should know? [^115sa979]. Insights Into Imaging (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Coronary chronic total occlusion (CTO) is defined as a total occlusion of coronary artery on invasive coronary angiography (ICA) with thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) of 0 flow for ≥ 3 months. It has been confirmed that 15 to 26% of patients referred for ICA had CTO. In previous clinical practice, coronary artery bypass grafting and optimal medical therapy have been the main treatment strategies for CTO lesions. With the rapid advancement of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) techniques, PCI has been increasingly used to treat CTO lesions in recent years. However, CTO PCI remains one of the most challenging procedures for interventional cardiologists, often described as "the last frontier", mainly due to low procedural success rates, high incidence of procedural complications, and controversial clinical benefits. Intraprocedural evaluation by ICA often has problems such as incomplete assessment of CTO lesions, long procedural time, and excessive use of contrast agents. In recent years, advanced modern imaging modalities, especially coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA), have been used to manage CTO PCI from pre-procedural assessment to post-procedural guidance, thus reducing procedural time, optimizing the strategy of CTO PCI and improving procedural success rate. Thus, it is necessary to introduce basic knowledge of CTO on CCTA to radiologists, thus efficiently guiding clinical practice.

### Chronic total occlusion percutaneous coronary intervention: evidence and controversies [^117T41jD]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Two other randomized controlled trials were presented in 2017, but neither has been published as of November 2017. The DECISION‐CTO (Drug‐Eluting Stent Implantation Versus Optimal Medical Treatment in Patients with Chronic Total Occlusion; Clinical Trial Registration — URL: Unique identifier: NCT01078051) trial was presented at the 2017 American College of Cardiology meeting. 6 The EuroCTO (Randomized Multicenter Trial to Evaluate the Utilization of Revascularization or Optimal Medical Therapy for the Treatment of Chronic Total Coronary Occlusions; Clinical Trial Registration — URL: Unique identifier: NCT01760083) was presented at the 2017 EuroPCR meeting. 7 Both trials were stopped before completion of the planned enrollment and were, hence, underpowered.

DECISION‐CTO trial planned to enroll 1284 patients but was stopped early because of slow enrollment, after randomizing 834 patients with coronary CTOs to CTO PCI or optimal medical therapy alone (OMT). CTO PCI was performed with a high success rate (91%). Concurrent nonocclusive lesions were revascularized in many patients in both groups (77% and 79% for the OMT and CTO PCI groups, respectively). Nearly 20% of the OMT group crossed over to CTO PCI. At 3 years, the primary end point of death, MI, stroke, or repeated revascularization occurred in 19% of the OMT versus 21.4% of the CTO PCI group, suggesting noninferiority of OMT. Measures of quality of life (QoL; Seattle Angina Questionnaire) were similar between study groups. DECISION‐CTO trial has important design and execution limitations, hindering interpretation of its results and limiting their applicability to daily clinical practice. These limitations include the following: (1) high prevalence of non‐CTO lesions that were treated after enrollment in both study groups without knowledge of the presence of ischemia or symptoms after non‐CTO lesion revascularization; (2) high rates of crossover from OMT to CTO PCI; (3) mild baseline symptoms; (4) suboptimal primary end point, because the main benefit of CTO PCI is expected to be symptom improvement and not improvement in mortality or MI; (5) inappropriate design (noninferiority, although CTO PCI would need to be superior to replace the less invasive OMT); and (6) low power.

### Staged percutaneous intervention for concurrent chronic total occlusions in patients with ST-Segment-elevation myocardial infarction: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113RyLAr]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Acute ST‐segment–elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is typically caused by thrombotic occlusion of a coronary artery. The treatment of choice for STEMI is percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to restore blood flow to the occluded infarct‐related artery. 1, 2 Approximately 50% of patients presenting with STEMI are found to have multivessel coronary artery disease (CAD) with concomitant stenotic lesions in noninfarct‐related arteries (nIRAs) and ≈12% to 13% are found to have a chronic total occlusion (CTO) in an nIRA. 3, 4 Prior studies have shown that the presence of a CTO in an nIRA in patients with STEMI is linked to an increase in short‐ and long‐term mortality. 4, 5 Moreover, it has been suggested that the presence of a CTO is associated with worse outcomes compared with the presence of multivessel CAD without a CTO. 3, 5, 6 Although there is evidence that multivessel revascularization in patients with STEMI might be beneficial, 7 it remains unclear whether revascularization via PCI of an nIRA CTO, and in particular in patients with STEMI, is translated to improved outcomes. The current literature includes several small studies which suggest that successful revascularization of CTO lesions is associated with a lower risk of death, stroke, and coronary artery bypass grafting; less recurrent angina; and improvement of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). 8, 9 However, a recent randomized prospective trial did not find benefit for patients with STEMI who had PCI of an nIRA CTO. 10 We therefore performed a meta‐analysis to compare outcomes between patients presenting with STEMI who underwent PCI revascularization of nIRA CTO versus those who did not.

### Invasive vs conservative management of patients with chronic total occlusion: results From the ISCHEMIA trial [^112FoQWe]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Randomized trials of chronic total occlusion (CTO) revascularization vs medical therapy have yielded inconsistent results.

Objectives

The aim of this study was to evaluate outcomes with an initial invasive strategy (INV) vs an initial conservative strategy (CON) in patients with coronary computed tomographic angiography (CCTA)-determined CTO in the ISCHEMIA (International Study of Comparative Health Effectiveness With Medical and Invasive Approaches) trial.

Methods

Participants in ISCHEMIA who underwent CCTA evaluated for CTO by the core laboratory (3,113 of 5,179 randomized patients [60%]) were categorized into subgroups with (100% stenosis) and without (< 100% stenosis) CTO. Primary analysis compared outcomes in those randomized to INV vs CON using an intention-to-treat approach. Secondary analyses compared outcomes using inverse probability weighting to model successful CTO revascularization (REV) in all INV participants vs CON participants.

Results

Of the 3,113 CCTA-evaluable participants, 1,470 had at least 1 CTO (752 INV and 718 CON). INV did not reduce cardiovascular (CV) death or myocardial infarction (MI) (5-year difference -3.5%; 95% CI: -7.8% to 0.8%) and resulted in more procedural MIs (2.5%; 95% CI: 1.0%-4.0%) but fewer spontaneous MIs (-6.3%; 95% CI: -9.7% to -3.2%) than CON. CTO REV modeled across INV had a high probability (> 90%) of any lower CV death or MI, MI, spontaneous MI, unstable angina, and heart failure counterbalanced by a higher rate of procedural MI. CTO REV significantly improved angina-related quality of life (mean difference 4.6 points), Rose Dyspnea Scale score (rescaled) (mean difference 5.3 points), and EQ-5D visual analog scale score (4.6 points).

Conclusions

In the ISCHEMIA trial, the risks and benefits of INV compared with CON were similar among patients with and without CCTA-determined CTO (more frequent procedural MI, less frequent spontaneous MI, and significantly improved angina and dyspnea-related quality of life). In an observational comparison, successful CTO REV was associated with a high probability of lower CV death or MI (driven by lower MI) compared with CON. (International Study of Comparative Health Effectiveness With Medical and Invasive Approaches [ISCHEMIA]; NCT01471522).

### Impact of a chronic total coronary occlusion on the incidence of appropriate implantable cardioverter-defibrillator shocks and mortality: a substudy of the Dutch outcome in ICD therapy (DO-IT)) registry [^1156dRS8]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Half of cardiovascular deaths are caused by sudden cardiac death. The implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) is a well‐established treatment option for the prevention of sudden cardiac death. According to the guidelines, patients with chronic ischemic heart disease, heart failure symptoms, and a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) have a class I indication for an ICD. However, most primary prevention patients with ICD will never experience appropriate ICD therapy for malignant ventricular arrhythmias. In contrast, these patients remain at risk for device‐related complications or inappropriate shocks, which could even increase their risk of death. Therefore, it is of great importance to select patients who will benefit most from ICD implantation and to identify factors that are able to predict appropriate ICD shocks.

The most frequent underlying cause of sudden cardiac death is coronary artery disease (CAD). One of the most severe forms of CAD is a chronic total coronary occlusion (CTO), defined as a 100% luminal obstruction that is older than 3 months. A CTO is observed in ≈20% of patients with significant CAD. The presence of a CTO is associated with a reduced LVEF, leading to increased risk of heart failure, cardiogenic shock, and a 4‐fold higher risk of sudden cardiac death. In addition, CTOs are often accompanied by collateral arteries, which usually maintain myocardial viability. However, collaterals are unable to prevent the occurrence of hypoxia during stress, often leading to ischemic or hibernating myocardium. This could be a substrate for ventricular arrhythmias in patients with CTO. Accordingly, several studies suggest that the incidence of appropriate ICD shocks is higher in patients with a CTO, compared with patients without a CTO or with a revascularized CTO. However, these studies are often retrospective or with limited sample size.

The Dutch‐Outcome in ICD Therapy (DO‐IT) registry is a nationwide prospective cohort, consisting of patients receiving an ICD for primary prevention in all ICD implanting centers in The Netherlands. This registry enables the prospective exploration of the impact of a CTO on the incidence of appropriate ICD shocks, to test the hypothesis that the presence of a CTO is associated with more delivered ICD shocks and increased all‐cause death.

### Chronic total occlusion percutaneous coronary intervention: present and future [^113bzory]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Interventions (2025). Medium credibility.

Chronic total occlusion percutaneous coronary intervention has evolved into a subspecialty of interventional cardiology. Using a variety of antegrade and retrograde techniques, experienced operators currently achieve success rates of 85% to 90%, with an incidence of major periprocedural complications of ≈2% to 3%. Several developments in equipment (new microcatheters and guidewires, novel reentry devices), imaging (computed tomography angiography guidance, intravascular imaging for reentry), techniques (intraocclusion contrast injection, advanced subintimal tracking and reentry), and artificial intelligence (automated computed tomography image analysis and prediction of the likelihood of crossing success with various techniques) could further improve outcomes. Global collaboration and rapid dissemination of new developments accelerate the pace of progress. While innovation is exciting and necessary, adhering to the basic principles of chronic total occlusion percutaneous coronary intervention (such as continual assessment of risks and benefits, meticulous angiographic review, and use of dual injection) remains critical for achieving optimal patient outcomes.

### 2021 ACC / AHA / SCAI guideline for coronary artery revascularization: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint Committee on Clinical practice guidelines [^114uX7Lz]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

ACC/AHA/SCAI 2021 coronary revascularization — treatment of chronic total occlusion (CTO) states that in patients with suitable anatomy who have refractory angina on medical therapy, after treatment of non-CTO lesions, the benefit of PCI of a CTO to improve symptoms is uncertain (Class 2b, Level B-R). Technical performance notes success rates in excess of 80% in the hands of skilled operators, but the 30-day mortality rate after CTO PCI is 1.3% and perforations occur in 4.8% of cases. Supportive trial evidence reports that the EXPLORE and REVASC trials did not demonstrate any improvement in ventricular function with CTO PCI versus optimal medical therapy and that DECISION-CTO did not demonstrate any difference in symptoms or clinical outcomes with CTO PCI; accordingly, shared decision-making should inform the treatment of patients with refractory angina despite GDMT with a remaining CTO coronary lesion.

### Guiding principles for chronic total occlusion percutaneous coronary intervention [^116BNxsb]. Circulation (2019). Medium credibility.

Outcomes of chronic total occlusion (CTO) percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) have improved because of advancements in equipment and techniques. With global collaboration and knowledge sharing, we have identified 7 common principles that are widely accepted as best practices for CTO-PCI. 1. Ischemic symptom improvement is the primary indication for CTO-PCI. 2. Dual coronary angiography and in-depth and structured review of the angiogram (and, if available, coronary computed tomography angiography) are key for planning and safely performing CTO-PCI. 3. Use of a microcatheter is essential for optimal guidewire manipulation and exchanges. 4. Antegrade wiring, antegrade dissection and reentry, and the retrograde approach are all complementary and necessary crossing strategies. Antegrade wiring is the most common initial technique, whereas retrograde and antegrade dissection and reentry are often required for more complex CTOs. 5. If the initially selected crossing strategy fails, efficient change to an alternative crossing technique increases the likelihood of eventual PCI success, shortens procedure time, and lowers radiation and contrast use. 6. Specific CTO-PCI expertise and volume and the availability of specialized equipment will increase the likelihood of crossing success and facilitate prevention and management of complications, such as perforation. 7. Meticulous attention to lesion preparation and stenting technique, often requiring intracoronary imaging, is required to ensure optimum stent expansion and minimize the risk of short- and long-term adverse events. These principles have been widely adopted by experienced CTO-PCI operators and centers currently achieving high success and acceptable complication rates. Outcomes are less optimal at less experienced centers, highlighting the need for broader adoption of the aforementioned 7 guiding principles along with the development of additional simple and safe CTO crossing and revascularization strategies through ongoing research, education, and training.

### Management of chronic total coronary occlusion in stable ischemic heart disease by percutaneous coronary intervention versus coronary artery bypass grafting versus medical therapy [^111LzcZs]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Coronary chronic total occlusions (CTOs) are found in approximately 20% of angiograms. We sought to assess the variation in the management of patients with CTOs and to compare the clinical outcomes of CTO lesions with those of non-CTO lesions. We conducted a population-based cohort study and included all patients with stable angina who underwent cardiac catheterization from October 1, 2012, to June 30, 2013, in Ontario, Canada. The primary outcome was a composite of mortality and hospitalization for myocardial infarction. A total of 7,864 patients were included, of whom 2,279 (29%) had a CTO. There were substantial differences in revascularization rates for patients with CTOs across hospitals in Ontario (44.9% to 94.1%). Revascularization was associated with improved outcomes in the overall cohort. Although the advantage of coronary artery bypass grafting over medical therapy was consistent in both patients with CTOs and patients without CTOs, the benefit of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was limited to patients without CTOs (hazard ratio 0.56, 95% confidence interval 0.40- to 0.78), with no difference in patients with CTOs. The CTO lesion, however, was revascularized in few of the PCI cases (41.1%), with PCI limited to the non-CTO lesion in most patients.

### Epidemiology, management strategies, and outcomes of patients with chronic total coronary occlusion [^117MiJER]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Factors influencing the management of patients with chronic total occlusion (CTO) are poorly described. We sought to analyze the clinical and angiographic variables influencing the decision-making process of patients with CTO. Consecutive patients with at least 1 coronary artery CTO were included and categorized as managed either by percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), or medical therapy (MT). Patients with previous CABG were excluded. The CTO SYNTAX score (CTO-SS) was defined as the ratio between the score attributed to the CTO lesion in the SYNTAX score calculation and the total SYNTAX score. Independent predictors of management strategies were sought. A total of 510 patients were included (CTO incidence: 20%): 9% were treated with PCI, 34% with CABG, and 57% with MT. SYNTAX score was lowest in PCI (14.8 [11.0 to 18.5]) and highest in CABG (31.5 [25.0 to 38.8], p < 0.0001). PCI was attempted more often in patients with higher CTO-SS (i.e., those with higher contribution to the overall SYNTAX score from the CTO lesion; 88% had a CTO-SS > 0.5). Conversely, CABG was preferred in subjects with lower CTO-SS (61% had a CTO-SS ≤ 0.5, p < 0.0001). Age, ejection fraction, SYNTAX score, and age of the CTO were independent predictors of revascularization. At mid-term follow-up, unsuccessful revascularization or MT was independently associated with death (hazard ratio 7.2, p = 0.0005). In conclusion, CTOs are frequently documented in clinical practice. However, less than a half is revascularized. Management strategies are influenced by angiographic variables such as the SYNTAX score and the newly proposed CTO-SS.

### Chronic total occlusion percutaneous coronary intervention case selection and techniques for the antegrade-only operator [^114EXvK3]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2015). Low credibility.

Coronary chronic total occlusions (CTO) remain a difficult lesion subset to treat. Although CTOs are present at coronary angiography in 15–20% of patients, only a small fraction of eligible patients will be offered percutaneous treatment. Recent publications from centers with dedicated CTO programs using the full range of antegrade and retrograde techniques suggest success rates in the range of 90% even when little anatomic exclusion are used. However, many patients with clinically appropriate CTO targets have simpler anatomy that can predictably be managed without the selected skills and equipment. The purpose of this review is to provide skilled percutaneous coronary intervention operators who have not specialized in complex retrograde CTO techniques, an algorithm for the selection and antegrade management of appropriate CTO cases. Core equipment and techniques are discussed.

### Chronic total occlusions: successful recanalization of very old lesions [^1116Mcjg]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

The treatment of chronic total occlusion is thought to be the final frontier in treating coronary artery disease nonsurgically. In the past, an old occlusion was not likely to be treated successfully percutaneous. We have had success in revascularizing some very old 20 plus year old occlusions percutaneously.

Methods

Six patients were treated who had > 20-year-old occlusions. Five patients were male; mean age of patients was 72.2 years (range 63–86). Mean age of the occlusion was 24.8 years. All patients had ischemia in the corresponding territory. Four of the patients had right coronary artery occlusions; one had a left circumflex occlusion and one had left anterior descending artery occlusion.

Results

Using a combination of radial and/or femoral approach, we successfully recanalized all of these old occlusions. No patients had major adverse cardiac events. Two patients developed restenosis at follow-up that was subsequently treated uneventfully. All the patients had a complete relief of angina.

Conclusion

In a small single center experience, even very old occlusions > 20-year old can be effectively treated with dedicated systems, excellent guiding catheter support and experienced physicians.

### Chronic total occlusion is not a risk factor for mortality in patients with successful percutaneous coronary intervention: a Cohort study [^116ptm1W]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Research Question and Hypothesis

How is the long‐term risk of death for any cause in patients with CTO treated with PCI associated with the procedural success, compared with patients with non‐CTO? Our hypotheses were: (1) patients with CTO who underwent successful revascularization of CTOs have a similar all‐cause mortality compared with patients with non‐CTO CAD; and (2) patients with remaining CTOs after failed CTO PCI have a worse all‐cause mortality compared with patients with non‐CTO CAD.

### Percutaneous coronary intervention or medical therapy for chronic total occlusion in older adults [^111heEnb]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Managing coronary chronic total occlusion (CTO) in older adults remains challenging due to a scarcity of evidence.

Objectives

We aimed to assess the association of attempted/successful CTO percutaneous coronary intervention (CTO-PCI) with quality of life (QoL) measures, all-cause mortality, and cardiovascular outcomes in studies that adequately represented older adults.

Methods

A systematic search of 6 databases was performed to identify randomized trials and observational studies comparing CTO-PCI with optimal medical therapy (OMT) in adults, with particular inclusion of studies adequately representing older individuals. Meta-regression analyses were conducted to estimate relative risks (RRs) for key outcomes.

Results

A total 29 studies encompassing 19,282 patients were included, of which 28 were observational. Compared with OMT, attempted CTO-PCI was significantly associated with reductions in cardiac death (RR: 0.55; 95% CI: 0.40–0.76), all-cause mortality (RR: 0.61; 95% CI: 0.50–0.75), and major adverse cardiovascular events (RR: 0.68; 95% CI: 0.60–0.78). Rates of myocardial infarction and revascularization were similar between groups. In analyses comparing successful vs failed CTO-PCI, only cardiac death and all-cause mortality were reduced. In addition, among the 4 studies that evaluated QoL, attempted/successful CTO-PCI yielded greater improvements than OMT/failed PCI. Evidence for the above results were derived from observational studies and remained less certain.

Conclusions

In older adults, attempted or successful CTO-PCI may be associated with improved QoL and favorable cardiovascular outcomes compared with OMT; however, as these findings are largely derived from observational studies, they should be viewed as hypothesis-generating. Randomized trials in representative older populations are needed to confirm these associations.

### Myocardial infarction and all-cause mortality following percutaneous coronary intervention versus conservative treatment of chronic total occlusions: a west Denmark heart registry study [^112t5dyL]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Chronic total coronary occlusions (CTOs) are found in about 30% of patients referred for a diagnostic coronary angiography. Recent developments in CTO percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) have been associated with improved procedural success, reduced risk of complications, and consequently improved outcomes for patients undergoing CTO‐PCI. Despite these improvements, the majority of CTO patients have been treated with coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) or medical therapy. CTO‐PCI requires special experience and skills and should be performed by high‐volume operators doing more 60 cases per year.

There is no randomized clinical trial‐derived evidence supporting improved prognostic outcomes following CTO‐PCI. Recently, two randomized clinical trials compared CTO‐PCI to optimal medical therapy: The DECISION‐CTO (Drug‐Eluting Stent Implantation vs. Optimal Medical Treatment in Patients With Chronic Total Occlusion) trial and EURO‐CTO (A Randomized Multicenter Trial to Evaluate the Utilization of Revascularization or Optimal Medical Therapy for the Treatment of Chronic Total Occlusions). Both trials failed to find significant differences in major cardiac cerebrovascular events up to 3 years. However, the EURO‐CTO trial indicated better symptom control and quality of life in PCI‐treated patients. Both trials were underpowered to show any difference in myocardial infarction (MI) and had a high number of protocol deviations following randomization, especially there were high rates of primary and secondary crossing over.

The ongoing ISCHEMIA‐CTO trial (International randomized trial on the effect of revascularization or optimal medical therapy of CTOs with myocardial ischemia) evaluates the prognostic value of CTO‐PCI in patients with CTO lesion and myocardial ischemia ≥ 10% of left ventricular territory, and results are expected by 2029.

Numerous registry studies have described improved patient outcomes, including reduced mortality, of successful CTO‐PCI as compared to an unsuccessful intervention. Because of a biased patient selection, comparisons of outcomes in CTO‐PCI versus conservatively treated patients are problematic. Another recent comparative analysis of randomized controlled trials and cohort studies found that there are more complex CTOs, comorbidities, and fewer successful CTOs in cohort studies, underlining the importance of assessing real‐world data. A recent cohort study demonstrated similar all‐cause mortality in CTO‐PCI and in chronic coronary syndrome patients but increased all‐cause mortality in patients with failed CTO‐PCI.

### Alternatives to traditional coronary bypass surgery [^113S6Qtn]. Seminars in Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Over 1 million percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) and a half million surgical coronary artery bypass grafting procedures (CABG) are performed in the United States annually for treatment of coronary artery disease. With recent advances in anti-restenosis strategies, the number of PCIs is expected to increase dramatically. Still, these therapies treat relatively discrete coronary lesions. However, there is a relatively large number of patients for whom traditional therapies are not optimal, either because there are diffuse coronary artery lesions, because there are chronic total occlusions, or because, in the instance of bypass surgery, creating proximal or distal anastomoses is problematic. We review three strategies in various stages of development aimed at treating patients not optimally served by traditional forms of revascularization: transmyocardial laser revascularization, angiogenic therapies, and direct ventricle-to-coronary artery bypass.

### Outcomes of percutaneous coronary intervention for chronic total occlusions in the elderly: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112k1Nsg]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Over the past several years, owing to improvements in public health programs and the availability of high‐quality medical care, there has been an increase in life expectancy. The cohort of the elderly population is increasing with a corresponding increase in the prevalence of the cardiac disease, especially coronary artery disease (CAD). 1 According to angiographic data, chronic total occlusions (CTO) constitute around 18.4% of lesions in patients with significant CAD. 2 The prevalence of CTO is especially high in the elderly and the presence of other comorbidities like peripheral artery disease, stroke, hypertension, and diabetes significantly complicates the management of these lesions in older adults. 3

Historical data indicates that coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery or medical therapy were commonly used strategies for CTO. 4 However, over the years with improvement in percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) techniques like availability of sophisticated guidewire, use of retrograde approach, and antegrade dissection and reentry methods have significantly improved the success of CTO‐PCI. An increasing number of patients are now undergoing this percutaneous procedure for CTO. 5 Evidence suggests that successful PCI for CTO is associated with improved survival as well as the reduction of adverse cardiac events. 6, 7 Kirschbaum et al. 8 have demonstrated that revascularization of CTO with PCI leads to improvement in left ventricular remodeling and ejection fraction, which is observed up to 3 years post‐PCI.

### Hybrid approach improves success of chronic total occlusion angioplasty [^117XHFhf]. Heart (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

Treatment options for coronary chronic total occlusions (CTO) are limited, with low historical success rates from percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). We report procedural outcomes of CTO PCI from 7 centres with dedicated CTO operators trained in hybrid approaches comprising antegrade/retrograde wire escalation (AWE/RWE) and dissection re-entry (ADR/RDR) techniques.

Methods

Clinical and procedural data were collected from consecutive unselected patients with CTO between 2012 and 2014. Lesion complexity was graded by the Multicentre CTO Registry of Japan (J-CTO) score, with ≥ 2 defined as complex. Success was defined as thrombolysis in myocardial infarction 3 flow with < 30% residual stenosis, subclassified as at first attempt or overall. Inhospital complications and 30-day major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs, death/myocardial infarction/unplanned target vessel revascularisation) were recorded.

Results

1156 patients were included. Despite high complexity (mean J-CTO score 2.5 ± 1.3), success rates were 79% (first attempt) and 90% (overall) with 30-day MACE of 1.6%. AWE was highly effective in less complex lesions (J-CTO ≤ 1 94% success vs 79% in J-CTO score ≥ 2). ADR/RDR was used more commonly in complex lesions (J-CTO ≤ 1 15% vs J-CTO ≥ 2 56%). Need for multiple approaches during each attempt increased with lesion complexity (17% J-CTO ≤ 1 vs 48% J-CTO ≥ 2). Lesion modification ('investment procedures') at the end of unsuccessful first attempts increased the chance of subsequent success (96% vs 71%).

Conclusions

Hybrid-trained operators can achieve overall success rates of 90% in real world practice with acceptable MACE. Use of dissection re-entry and investment procedures maintains high success rates in complex lesions. The hybrid approach represents a significant advance in CTO treatment.

### Late survival benefit of percutaneous coronary intervention compared with medical therapy in patients with coronary chronic total occlusion: a 10-year follow-up study [^111aUW8t]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

In this large‐scale cohort of consecutive patients with CTO lesions, we compared extended long‐term clinical outcomes between CTO‐PCI and OMT as the initial treatment strategy. The major findings of our study were as follows: (1) patients in the CTO‐PCI group had a lower risk of cardiac mortality than patients in the OMT group, as well as that of all‐cause mortality, acute myocardial infarction, and any revascularization; (2) the differences diverged 3 years after initial treatment strategy; and (3) there were no significant interactions between the initial approach and cardiac death among the subgroups.

Several observational studies comparing CTO‐PCI with OMT have reported a lower risk of major adverse cardiac events with CTO‐PCI. 11, 12 Methodological limitation prevents any definitive conclusions on the effects of CTO‐PCI. The DECISION‐CTO trial and EUROCTO are randomized controlled trials for systematically comparing the CTO‐PCI and OMT. In the DECISION‐CTO trial, 834 patients were randomly assigned to the CTO‐PCI (n = 417) or OMT (n = 398) group as an initial treatment strategy for CTO lesions. During a median follow‐up of 4 years, the incidence of the composite of death, myocardial infarction, stroke, and target vessel revascularization was similar between the PCI and OMT groups. 5 The study was underpowered because of early termination before achievement of target enrollment, and the high number of crossovers in the OMT group may have led to underestimation of the effect of the CTO‐PCI strategy. 13 EUROCTO also ended prematurely after randomizing 407 instead of the planned 1200 patients because of slow enrollment. At 12 months, the cardiovascular event rate was comparable between the CTO‐PCI and OMT groups. 4 Despite randomized controlled trials as a high level of evidence, both the DECISION‐CTO trial and EUROCTO were limited by low enrollment, leading to underpowered sample size and midterm follow‐up duration. In addition, both trials included a minimally symptomatic population (baseline angina frequency score > 75). 14 It could be speculated that the patients who may see most advantage from CTO‐PCI were not included in the randomized controlled trials because of severe signs of ischemia, leading to enrollment of low‐risk patients and consequently limiting the inferential aim regarding risk reduction of hard outcomes. The rates of cardiac death in the DECISION‐CTO trial (2.7% during median follow‐up of 4 years) and EUROCTO (0.5% at 12 months) were lower than the 3‐year rate of cardiac death in the present study (4.7%). As a result of these limitations, extended long‐term follow‐up might help us to better understand the impact of CTO‐PCI in the general population.

### Late survival benefit of percutaneous coronary intervention compared with medical therapy in patients with coronary chronic total occlusion: a 10-year follow-up study [^112c1V4q]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

As an initial treatment strategy, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for coronary chronic total occlusion (CTO) did not show midterm survival benefits compared with optimal medical therapy (OMT). We sought to evaluate the benefit of PCI compared with OMT in patients with CTO over extended long‐term follow‐up.

Methods and Results

Between March 2003 and February 2012, 2024 patients with CTO were enrolled in a single‐center registry and followed for ≈10 years. We excluded patients with CTO who underwent coronary artery bypass graft (n = 477) and classified patients into the CTO‐PCI group (n = 883) or OMT group (n = 664) according to initial treatment strategy. Patients with multivessel disease received PCI for obstructive non‐CTO lesions in both groups. In the CTO‐PCI group, 699 patients (79.2%) underwent successful revascularization. The CTO‐PCI group had a lower 10‐year rate of cardiac death (10.4% versus 22.3%; hazard ratio [HR], 0.44 [95% CI, 0.32–0.59]; P < 0.001) than the OMT group. After propensity score matching analyses, the CTO‐PCI group had a lower 10‐year rate of cardiac death (13.6% versus 20.8%; HR, 0.64 [95% CI, 0.45–0.91]; P = 0.01) than the OMT group. The relative reduction in cardiac death at 10 years was mainly driven by a relative reduction between 3 and 10 years (8.3% versus 16.6%; HR, 0.43 [95% CI, 0.27–0.71]; P < 0.001) but not at 3 years (5.7% versus 5.0%; HR, 1.12 [95% CI, 0.63–2.00]; P = 0.71). The beneficial effects of CTO‐PCI were consistent among subgroups.

Conclusions

As an initial treatment strategy, CTO‐PCI might reduce late cardiac death compared with OMT in patients with CTO. Extended follow‐up of randomized trials may confirm the findings of the present study.

Conclusions

This systematic review and meta-analysis of patients included in 7 randomized trials and registries found a clear improvement in health status–related life quality as assessed by the validated SAQ metrics in patients receiving a successful CTO-PCI. These findings suggest support for using PCI to treat CTOs in symptomatic patients unresponsive to medical treatment.

RISKS

CTO PCI carries increased risk of complications compared with non‐CTO PCI, including perforation, periprocedural myocardial infarction, and radiation skin injury. The average periprocedural complication risk is ≈3%. The risk increases with increasing angiographic complexity, use of advanced CTO techniques, such as the retrograde approach, older patient age, and comorbidities.

### Impact of a chronic total occlusion on outcomes after FFR-guided PCI or coronary bypass surgery: a FAME 3 substudy [^113z8We2]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Interventions (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The clinical impact of a chronic total occlusion (CTO) in patients with 3-vessel coronary artery disease undergoing fractional flow reserve-guided percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with current-generation drug-eluting stents or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is unclear.

Methods

The FAME 3 trial (Fractional Flow Reserve Versus Angiography for Multivessel Evaluation 3) compared fractional flow reserve-guided PCI with CABG in patients with 3-vessel coronary artery disease. The primary end point was major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events, a composite of death, myocardial infarction, stroke, or repeat revascularization at 1 year. In this substudy, the 3-year outcomes were analyzed in patients with or without a CTO.

Results

Of the patients randomized to PCI or CABG in the FAME 3 trial, 305 (21%) had a CTO. In the PCI arm, revascularization of the CTO was attempted in 61% with a procedural success rate of 88%. The incidence of major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events at 3 years was not significantly different between those with or without a CTO in both the PCI (15.2% versus 20.1%; adjusted hazard ratio, 0.62 [95% CI, 0.38–1.03]; P = 0.07) and the CABG (13.0% versus 12.9%; adjusted hazard ratio, 0.96 [95% CI, 0.55–1.66]; P = 0.88) arms. In those without a CTO, PCI was associated with a significantly higher risk of major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events compared with CABG (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.61 [95% CI, 1.20–2.17]; P < 0.01) but not in those with a CTO (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.21 [95% CI, 0.64–2.28]; P = 0.56; P interaction = 0.31).

Conclusions

The presence of a CTO did not significantly impact the treatment effect of PCI versus CABG at 3 years in patients with 3-vessel coronary artery disease.

### Medical therapy, percutaneous coronary intervention and prognosis in patients with chronic total occlusions [^114DeiNJ]. Heart (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

There is little published data reporting outcomes for those found to have a chronic total coronary occlusion (CTO) that is electively treated medically versus those treated by percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). We sought to compare long-term clinical outcomes between patients treated by PCI and elective medical therapy in a consecutive cohort of patients with an identified CTO.

Methods

Patients found to have a CTO on angiography between January 2002 and December 2007 in a single tertiary centre were identified using a dedicated database. Those undergoing CTO PCI and elective medical therapy to the CTO were propensity matched to adjust for baseline clinical and angiographic differences.

Results

In total, 1957 patients were identified, a CTO was treated by PCI in 405 (20.7%) and medical therapy in 667 (34.1%), 885 (45.2%) patients underwent coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Of those treated by PCI or medical therapy, propensity score matching identified 294 pairs of patients, PCI was successful in 177 patients (60.2%). All-cause mortality at 5years was 11.6% for CTO PCI and 16.7% for medical therapy HR 0.63 (0.40 to 1.00, p = 0.052). The composite of 5-year death or myocardial infarction occurred in 13.9% of the CTO PCI group and 19.6% in the medical therapy group, HR 0.64 (0.42 to 0.99, p = 0.043). Among the CTO PCI group, if the CTO was revascularised by any means during the study period, 5-year mortality was 10.6% compared with 18.3% in those not revascularised in the medical therapy group, HR 0.50 (0.28–0.88, p = 0.016).

Conclusions

Revascularisation, but not necessarily PCI of a CTO, is associated with improved long-term survival relative to medical therapy alone.

### Early procedural and health status outcomes after chronic total occlusion Angioplasty: a report from the OPEN-CTO registry (outcomes, patient health status, and efficiency in chronic total occlusion hybrid procedures) [^111A4bwp]. JACC: Cardiovascular Interventions (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study sought to accurately describe the success rate, risks, and patient-reported benefits of contemporary chronic total occlusion (CTO) percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

Background

In light of the evolving techniques to successfully revascularize CTO lesions, there remains a compelling need to more accurately quantify the success rates, risks, and benefits of these complex procedures.

Methods

Using a uniquely comprehensive, core-lab adjudicated, single-arm, multicenter registry of 1,000 consecutive patients undergoing CTO PCI by the hybrid approach, we evaluated the technical success rates, complication rates, and raw and adjusted health status benefits at 1 month among successfully as compared to unsuccessfully treated patients.

Results

Technical success was high (86%). In-hospital and 1-month mortality was 0.9% and 1.3%, respectively, and perforations requiring treatment occurred in 48 patients (4.8%). Among those who survived and completed the 1-month interview (n = 947), mean ± SEM Seattle Angina Questionnaire quality of life scores improved from 49.4 ± 0.9 to 75.0 ± 0.7 (p < 0.01), mean Rose Dyspnea Scale scores improved (decreased) from 2.0 ± 0.1 to 1.1 ± 0.1 (p < 0.01), and physician health questionnaire (for depression) scores improved (decreased) from 6.2 ± 0.2 to 3.5 ± 0.1 (p < 0.01) at 1 month. After adjusting for baseline differences the mean group difference in Seattle Angina Questionnaire quality of life between successful and unsuccessful CTO PCI was 10.8 (95% confidence interval: 6.3 to 15.3; p < 0.001).

Conclusions

Clarifying the success rates, risks, and benefits of CTO PCI will help to more accurately contextualize the informed consent process for these procedures so that patients with appropriate indications for CTO PCI can more effectively share in the decision to pursue this or other therapeutic options.

### Patients with chronic total occlusions undergoing percutaneous coronary interventions: characteristics, success, and outcomes [^111CWDb3]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Interventions (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for chronic total occlusions (CTO) has been identified as a beneficial treatment, but there is limited information about its use in everyday practice.

Methods and Results

Data from New York's PCI registry between July 1, 2009, and June 30, 2012, were used to examine the utilization and variation in use of CTO PCI, the success rates across providers, the multivariable correlates of success, and the mortality of successful CTO PCI. A total of 4030 (3.1%) patients undergoing PCI underwent CTO PCI with a success rate of 61.3%. Patients with successful CTO PCIs were younger; had higher ejection fractions; were less likely to have had previous revascularization or carotid/cerebrovascular disease; and were more likely to have the CTO in the left anterior descending artery. Operators with annual CTO PCI volumes of at least 48 per year (the top volume quartile) had odds of achieving success that were more than twice as high as the half of all operators who performed < 9 CTO PCIs per year. Patients with unsuccessful CTO PCIs had significantly higher 2.5-year mortality (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.63; 95% confidence interval, 1.28–2.08) than patients who had complete revascularization (CR) for all CTOs and other diseased lesions.

Conclusions

The success rate for CTO is low compared with the rate for other lesions. Successful revascularization of CTO is associated with improved survival compared with procedures with unsuccessful CTO, and higher-volume CTO operators are more successful.

### Meta-analysis of clinical outcomes of patients who underwent percutaneous coronary interventions for chronic total occlusions [^1114q693]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Successful percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for chronic total occlusions (CTOs) has been associated with clinical benefit. There are no randomized controlled trials on long-term clinical outcomes after CTO PCI, limiting the available evidence to observational cohort studies. We sought to perform a weighted meta-analysis of the long-term outcomes of successful versus failed CTO PCI. A total of 25 studies, published from 1990 to 2014, with 28,486 patients (29,315 CTO PCI procedures) were included. We analyzed data on mortality, subsequent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), myocardial infarction, major adverse cardiac events, angina pectoris, stroke, and target vessel revascularization using random-effects models. Procedural success was 71% (range 51% to 87%). During a weighted mean follow-up of 3.11 years, compared with unsuccessful, successful CTO PCI was associated with lower mortality (odds ratio [OR] 0.52, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.43 to 0.63), less residual angina (OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.60), lower risk for stroke (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.88), less need for subsequent coronary artery bypass grafting (OR 0.18, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.22), and lower risk for major adverse cardiac events (0.59, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.79). There was no difference in the incidence of target vessel revascularization (OR 0.66, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.23) or myocardial infarction (OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.03). Outcomes were similar in patients who underwent balloon angioplasty only or stenting with bare metal or drug-eluting stents. Compared with failed procedures, successful CTO PCIs are associated with a lower risk of death, stroke, and coronary artery bypass grafting and less recurrent angina pectoris.

### Chronic total occlusion percutaneous coronary intervention: evidence and controversies [^116f3dtj]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

In contrast to DECISION‐CTO trial, QoL was the primary efficacy end point in EuroCTO (Seattle Angina Questionnaire components at 12 months). Patients with non‐CTO lesions could not be enrolled until after such lesions were successfully recanalized. The initial plan was to enroll 1200 patients but because of slow enrollment, the study ended after randomizing 407 patients 2:1 to CTO PCI and OMT or OMT alone. Procedural success was 86.3%, and 7.3% of the OMT‐only group crossed over to CTO PCI. Likely because of small sample size, the study showed statistically significant improvement with CTO PCI in only 1 of the 5 components of the Seattle Angina Questionnaire (ie, angina frequency; P = 0.009).

Although randomized controlled clinical trials are the gold standard for determining the efficacy and safety of an intervention, only 15% of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guideline recommendations are based on level A evidence. 11 Therefore, in most cases, clinical decision making relies on less robust clinical evidence, such as retrospective and observational studies.

Observational Studies: Revascularization Versus No Revascularization of CTOs

Several observational studies have compared the outcomes of CTO PCI with no revascularization; the largest ones are summarized in Table 1.

Tomasello et al 9 examined the long‐term outcomes of 1777 CTO patients from the Italian CTO Registry, according to treatment strategy: PCI, 43.7%; medical therapy, 46.5%; or surgery, 9.8%. At 1‐year follow‐up, the incidence of cardiac death (1.4% versus 4.7% versus 6.3%; P < 0.001) and major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) (2.6% versus 8.2% and 6.9%; P < 0.001) were significantly lower in the PCI group. After propensity matching (n = 619), medical therapy was associated with the higher MACE rate (7.6% versus 1.7%; P < 0.001), cardiac death (4.4% versus 1.5%; P = 0.002), acute MI (2.9% versus 1.1%), and rehospitalization (4.4% versus 2.3%; P = 0.04), compared with CTO PCI.

### Recovery of myocardial perfusion after percutaneous coronary intervention of chronic total occlusions is comparable to hemodynamically significant non-occlusive lesions [^113nHr7i]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2019). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Chronic coronary total occlusions (CTOs) are diagnosed in approximately one fifth of patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). 1 Due to historically low success rates, increased complication rates, and concerns regarding patient benefit, only the minority of patients with a CTO is referred for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). 1, 2, 3 Recently, the development of the "hybrid approach", an algorithm for treating CTOs in a most safe, effective, and efficient way, has resulted in high success and acceptable complication rates. 4, 5 Ischemic burden comprising > 10% of the left ventricle due to CAD holds prognostic relevance, and several studies have shown extensive ischemia to be present in nearly all patients with a CTO. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 Therefore, next to symptom recognition and viability detection, ischemia detection forms one of the pillars in judicious patient selection for CTO PCI. Major reductions in ischemia can be achieved after CTO PCI, however, it is more conservatively employed compared with PCI of a non‐CTO lesion. 12, 13, 14 [15 O]H 2 O positron emission tomography (PET) is the gold standard for non‐invasive myocardial perfusion imaging, reflecting the composite of the epicardial as well as the microvascular bed, and enabling absolute quantification of myocardial perfusion. 15 The aim of this study was to compare the effects of PCI among CTO versus non‐CTO lesions on quantitative myocardial blood flow (MBF) and perfusion defect size.

### Predicting residual angina after chronic total occlusion percutaneous coronary intervention: insights from the OPEN-CTO registry [^112jT7AV]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is often performed for patients with chronic stable coronary artery disease, and has been shown to improve angina symptoms in large randomized controlled trials. Chronic total occlusion (CTO) of a coronary artery is often found on routine diagnostic angiography, but PCI of such lesions is not frequently attempted. Newer approaches have made it possible to achieve technical success in crossing CTO lesions, though complication rates are higher.

Understanding the expected angina relief from CTO PCI is essential to support shared decision‐making with patients, particularly given the increased procedural risks associated with CTO PCI. Many studies have shown an improvement in anginal symptoms after CTO PCI, but the patient response is not uniform. Although there are models to predict technical success in CTO PCI, data on patient‐level predictors of angina improvement after CTO PCI are lacking. Identifying which patients may be the most likely to experience angina improvement, and which others may have residual angina, is critically important to inform appropriate patient selection for these higher risk procedures.

To address this gap in knowledge, we leveraged a large registry of consecutive CTO PCI procedures to describe factors associated with residual angina after CTO PCI and developed a prediction model for postprocedure angina. Such results can guide individualized clinical decision‐making, patient counseling, and patient selection.

### Coronary chronic total occlusion on coronary CT angiography: what radiologists should know? [^113ZSATE]. Insights Into Imaging (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Diagnosis and treatment of CTO lesions are great challenges for both interventional cardiologists and radiologists. Interventional cardiologists need to consider multiple factors for CTO PCI, including clinical risk factors, evidence of ischemia, CTO anatomical parameters, and the experience of interventionalists. CCTA shows great potential for helping radiologists diagnose and evaluate CTO lesions due to its powerful post-processing technology. In addition, dynamic CTP together with CCTA that can obtain both anatomical and perfusion data can also be applied in CTO patients to help select candidates for CTO PCI. Before CTO PCI, radiologists can cooperate with interventionalists by assessing the detailed anatomical features of CTO lesions to objectively grade the difficulties of CTO PCI and then help them select the most appropriate crossing pathways. During the procedure, the feasibility of fusion of CCTA with fluoroscopic angiography technology is increasingly being demonstrated. After CTO PCI, CCTA can guide a second attempt after a failed CTO PCI or be a non-invasive follow-up tool. Taken together, CCTA is becoming a one-stop-shop imaging modality for patients with CTO.

Some limitations of this analysis should be acknowledged. First, this meta‐analysis included studies with different inclusion criteria, which may result in an all‐comer population with CTO with the risk of underestimating the effect of CTO‐PCI in specific subgroups who potentially are more likely to benefit from CTO‐PCI. Moreover, studies reported outcomes on varying time points and had low event rates. The 12 months all‐cause death data analysis should be interpreted carefully as the wide CIs indicate compatibility with a broad range of associations. Additionally, all RCTs had a slow inclusion rate as a shared limitation, which particularly affects the evolution of PCI techniques. In conclusion, when combining data from 1818 patients enrolled in 5 RCTs, randomization to CTO‐PCI was not associated with lower all‐cause mortality compared with medical therapy at either 1, 3 to 5, or 10 years. Nevertheless, patients experienced less angina after CTO‐PCI, even over the long term. Also in the medical therapy group the majority of the patients experienced CCS class 0 or 1. This may imply that patients had few symptoms initially; however, it cannot be stated with certainty as the CCS classes at baseline were not routinely documented.

### Outcomes of percutaneous coronary intervention for chronic total occlusions in the elderly: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111FEeg6]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

Our study, which is the first meta‐analysis assessing the outcomes of CTO‐PCI in the elderly, revealed the following important findings. (1) In‐hospital mortality for CTO‐PCI may not be different between elderly and nonelderly, but there is a tendency of higher risk of early MACE in the elderly group. (2) Risk of long‐term mortality and MACE is significantly increased in the elderly following CTO‐PCI. (3) Success of PCI is significantly lower in the elderly versus nonelderly. 4) In elderly patients with successful PCI, the risk of long‐term mortality and MACE is significantly reduced as compared to those with failed CTO‐PCI.

CTO is common in the elderly population and accounts for poor clinical outcomes in this age group. Therefore, the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and the European Association for Cardio‐Thoracic Surgery (EACTS) recommend that myocardial revascularization in the presence of CTO be considered if there are symptoms or objective evidence of cardiac ischemia in the area of the occluded artery. 21 This has been translated into clinical practice where the initial management of CTO in elderly patients is usually by medical therapy and in case of persistent angina or evidence of myocardial insufficiency, revascularization is indicated. Evidence comparing revascularization strategies versus medical therapy alone for CTO in the elderly population is limited. Flores‐Umanzor et al. 22 in a retrospective study of elderly patients (≥ 75 years) with CTO have compared 53 PCI procedures, 42 CABG procedures with 233 patients receiving only medical therapy. The authors reported that revascularization with either PCI or CABG in the elderly leads to reduced all‐cause and cardiac mortality. However, revascularization for a CTO with PCI or CABG is a complex procedure and many intervention cardiologists are reluctant to perform invasive treatment in elderly patients. Many retrospective observational studies have demonstrated a lack of statistically significant differences in outcomes with either CABG or PCI in elderly patients. 23, 24 However, due to concerns of neurological complications like cognitive decline in the elderly with CABG combined with the improvement of PCI equipment and techniques, PCI for CTO may be the preferred treatment modality in older adults. 25, 26

### Percutaneous coronary intervention versus optimal medical therapy for chronic total coronary occlusion with well-developed collaterals [^117Hs9Vb]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

We utilized PSM to reduce bias for the long‐term clinical outcomes and the change of LV function in patients with CTO and well‐developed collateral flow after CTO intervention as compared with CTO patients with OMT alone. The main findings of our present study were: (1) Although the CTO intervention in patients with well‐developed collateral flow yielded a significantly higher hazard of repeat revascularization than OMT alone strategy, it reduced composite of as death or MI; (2) improved LV function; and (3) gave benefits in subgroups such as patients with older age (> 65 years), non‐MI, reduced LVEF level (≤ 50%), and diabetes mellitus.

There were discrepancies in the results regarding survival rates and clinical effect after PCI of the CTO lesion. Several previous observational studies and meta‐analysis regarding clinical outcomes in patients with successful CTO PCI have demonstrated its beneficial effect, such as improved survival rates and LV function, compared with failed PCI. 1, 4, 5, 6, 8, 15 In contrast, some observational studies suggest that successful CTO PCI is not associated with improvement of survival rates and cardiovascular events. 16, 17 Thus, these heterogeneous data obscure the necessity of PCI for CTO lesion, and thus it is important to assess whether a patient can gain beneficial effects from a CTO intervention before performing PCI. Therefore, the results of our present study would be a supportive evidence for the indication of CTO intervention when physicians have to make a decision in a real‐world setting. Because our data results are originated from an all‐comer–based database, it nicely reflects our real‐world clinical practice and can be very meaningful, although the treatment strategies are not randomized.

### Procedural outcomes and long-term survival among patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention of a chronic total occlusion in native coronary arteries: a 20-year experience [^115BcLqG]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

Objectives

The study compared procedural outcomes and long-term survival for patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) of a chronic total coronary artery occlusion (CTO) with a matched non-CTO cohort to determine whether successful PCI of a CTO is associated with improved survival.

Background

Percutaneous coronary intervention of a CTO is a common occurrence, and the long-term survival for patients with successful PCI of a CTO has not been clearly defined.

Methods

Between June 1980 and December 1999, a total of 2,007 consecutive patients underwent PCI for a CTO. Utilizing propensity scoring methods, a matched non-CTO cohort of 2,007 patients was identified and compared to the CTO group. The cohorts were stratified into successful and failed procedures.

Results

The in-hospital major adverse cardiac event (MACE) rate was 3.8% in the CTO cohort. Technical success has improved over the last 10 years (overall 74.4%, slope 1.0%/yr, p = 0.02, R2 = 49.9%) as did procedural success (overall 69.9%, slope 1.2%/yr, p = 0.02, R2 = 51.5%) without a concomitant increase in in-hospital MACE rates (slope 0.1%/yr, p = 0.7). There was a distinct 10-year survival advantage for successful CTO treatment compared with failed CTO treatment (73.5% vs. 65.1%, p = 0.001). The CTO versus non-CTO 10-year survival was the same (71.2% vs. 71.4%, p = 0.9). Diabetics in the CTO cohort had a lower 10-year survival compared with nondiabetics (58.3% vs. 74.3%, p < 0.0001).

Conclusions

These data represent follow-up of the largest reported series of patients undergoing PCI for a CTO. The 10-year survival rates for matched non-CTO and the CTO cohorts were similar. Success rates have continued to improve without an accompanying increase in MACE rates. A successfully revascularized CTO confers a significant 10-year survival advantage compared with failed revascularization.

### Guidelines for percutaneous coronary interventions. the task force for percutaneous coronary interventions of the European Society of Cardiology [^1158ZqCj]. European Heart Journal (2005). Low credibility.

In patients with stable CAD, PCI can be considered a valuable initial mode of revascularization in all patients with objective large ischaemia in the presence of almost every lesion subset, with only one exception: chronic total occlusions that cannot be crossed. In early studies, there was a small survival advantage with CABG surgery compared with PCI without stenting. The addition of stents and newer adjunctive medications improved the outcome for PCI. The decision to recommend PCI or CABG surgery will be guided by technical improvements in cardiology or surgery, local expertise, and patients' preference. However, until proved otherwise, PCI should be used only with reservation in diabetics with multi-vessel disease and in patients with unprotected left main stenosis. The use of drug-eluting stents might change this situation. Patients presenting with NSTE-ACS (UA or NSTEMI) have to be stratified first for their risk of acute thrombotic complications. A clear benefit from early angiography (< 48 h) and, when needed, PCI or CABG surgery has been reported only in the high-risk groups. Deferral of intervention does not improve outcome. Routine stenting is recommended on the basis of the predictability of the result and its immediate safety. In patients with STEMI, primary PCI should be the treatment of choice in patients presenting in a hospital with PCI facility and an experienced team. Patients with contra-indications to thrombolysis should be immediately transferred for primary PCI, because this might be their only chance for quickly opening the coronary artery. In cardiogenic shock, emergency PCI for complete revascularization may be life-saving and should be considered at an early stage. Compared with thrombolysis, randomized trials that transferred the patients for primary PCI to a 'heart attack centre' observed a better clinical outcome, despite transport times leading to a significantly longer delay between randomization and start of the treatment. The superiority of primary PCI over thrombolysis seems to be especially clinically relevant for the time interval between 3 and 12 h after onset of chest pain or other symptoms on the basis of its superior preservation of myocardium. Furthermore, with increasing time to presentation, major-adverse-cardiac-event rates increase after thrombolysis, but appear to remain relatively stable after primary PCI. Within the first 3 h after onset of chest pain or other symptoms, both reperfusion strategies seem equally effective in reducing infarct size and mortality. Therefore, thrombolysis is still a viable alternative to primary PCI, if it can be delivered within 3 h after onset of chest pain or other symptoms. Primary PCI compared with thrombolysis significantly reduced stroke. Overall, we prefer primary PCI over thrombolysis in the first 3 h of chest pain to prevent stroke, and in patients presenting 3–12 h after the onset of chest pain, to salvage myocardium and also to prevent stroke. At the moment, there is no evidence to recommend facilitated PCI. Rescue PCI is recommended, if thrombolysis failed within 45–60 min after starting the administration. After successful thrombolysis, the use of routine coronary angiography within 24 h and PCI, if applicable, is recommended even in asymptomatic patients without demonstrable ischaemia to improve patients' outcome. If a PCI centre is not available within 24 h, patients who have received successful thrombolysis with evidence of spontaneous or inducible ischaemia before discharge should be referred to coronary angiography and revascularized accordingly — independent of 'maximal' medical therapy.

### Crossing peripheral chronic total occlusions: more tolls and more questions [^112yL6em]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

An Algorithmic Approach

Several techniques have been described for crossing FP‐CTOs. Knowing not only how, but also when, to use them is crucial. For this reason, an algorithmic approach akin to what is used in the coronary CTO landscape is recommended, as it can yield success rates as high as 90%. Presently, an evidenced‐based algorithm has been developed by a multidisciplinary group of expert FP‐CTO operators, representing the fields of interventional cardiology, vascular surgery, and interventional radiology, which allows interventionalists to use the optimal FP‐CTO crossing strategy based on intraprocedural findings. This algorithm centers on careful assessment of the following lesion characteristics: proximal and distal cap morphological features, segment length, calcium burden, and target vessel quality. These components will influence decision making on approach (antegrade, retrograde, or both), vascular access (radial, femoral, and/or pedal), and crossing technique (guidewire escalation versus dedicated device). Last, how the lesion is crossed and the level of trauma delivered to the target vessel will dictate final treatment strategy used (ie, angioplasty versus stent).

### Prognostic impact of collaterals in patients with a coronary chronic total occlusion: a meta-analysis of over 3, 000 patients [^116vQunE]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To assess the prognostic implications of the degree of coronary collaterals on outcomes in patients with a CTO.

Background

Coronary chronic total occlusions (CTO) are identified frequently in patients undergoing coronary angiography and have been associated with poorer prognosis. Whether the degree of coronary collaterals, the hallmark of CTOs impacts prognosis, is unknown.

Methods

A search of EMBASE, MEDLINE, and Cochrane Library was conducted to identify studies reporting on coronary collaterals and risk of all-cause mortality, acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and successful percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Patients with Rentrop grade 0 or 1 collaterals were defined as poor collaterals, while Rentrop grade 2 or 3 were defined as robust collaterals.

Results

Twelve studies with a total of 3,369 were included. Patients with robust collaterals did not have lower rates of AMI (OR: 0.89, 95%CI: 0.39–2.04) or lower rates of all-cause mortality (OR: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.42–1.58), however were more likely to have successful PCI (OR: 4.04, 95%CI: 1.10–14.85).

Conclusion

The presence of robust collaterals is not associated with lower rates of AMI or mortality, but does increase the likelihood of successful CTO PCI. These results have importance implications with respect to the indications for CTO PCI as well as selecting appropriate patients to undergo the procedure.

### Procedural, clinical, and health status outcomes in chronic total coronary occlusion revascularization: results from the PERSPECTIVE study [^1131oydF]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Limited research has detailed the outcomes of chronic total occlusion (CTO) percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with independent core laboratory and event adjudication. This study examined procedural, clinical, and patient-reported health status outcomes among patients undergoing CTO PCI with specific focus on outcomes for those treated with zotarolimus-eluting stents (ZES).

Methods

Among 500 consecutive patients undergoing attempted CTO PCI, procedural and in-hospital clinical outcomes were examined in addition to the 1-year composite endpoint of death, myocardial infarction, and target lesion revascularization (major adverse cardiac events, MACE). In a pre-specified cohort of 250 patients, health status measures were ascertained at baseline and 1year. A powered secondary endpoint was 1-year MACE among patients treated with ZES compared with a performance goal.

Results

Demographic, lesion, and procedural characteristics for the overall population included prior bypass surgery, 29.8%; diabetes, 35.2%; occlusion length > 20mm, 71.3%; J-CTO score, 2.5 ± 1.1; and primary retrograde strategy, 30.8%. Overall guidewire crossing was 90.9%; clinical success following guidewire crossing, 94.3%; and 1-year MACE rate, 12.1%. One-year health status significantly improved from baseline with successful CTO-PCI (angina frequency, 72.7 ± 26.5 at baseline to 96.0 ± 10.8, p < .0001). Compared with a performance goal derived from prior CTO DES trials (1-year hierarchal MACE, 25.2%), treatment with ZES was associated with significantly lower MACE (18.2%, one-sided upper CI, 23.6%, p = .017).

Conclusions

Favorable procedural success, health status improvements and late-term clinical outcomes inform the relative risks and benefits of CTO PCI when performed in a clinically indicated, complex patient population representative of those treated in clinical practice.

Limitations

Our meta‐analysis has several limitations. First, this is a meta‐analysis of RCTs and observational study data. Potential biases are likely to be greater for observational studies compared with RCTs; therefore, results should always be interpreted with caution when they are included in reviews and meta‐analyses. The presence of treatment selection bias is a major criticism against most observational studies, and may threaten the validity of study results when the sickest patients are more likely to receive one treatment strategy over another. In the absence of prospective allocation of patients to treatment strategies, there is an inherent bias that favors survival in those who live beyond the initial treatment to undergo staged treatment. The inherent bias and unmeasured confounding elements of observational studies may influence the study results despite multiple sensitivity analyses. 28 Second, this is a meta‐analysis performed on study‐level data. Third, the definitions, design, treatment exposure, protocols, reporting of adverse outcomes, and risk of enrolled patients differed across studies. These limitations might explain some of the observed heterogeneity for the different outcomes. Fourth, the selection criteria for PCI were diverse between studies. Fifth, crossover treatment was not reported consistently; it might have a significant unrecognized impact on the overall outcomes in nonattempted versus failed PCI. Sixth, in some studies, there was a considerable loss to follow‐up, with only a few studies providing detailed outcomes. Therefore, the long‐term risks and benefits of CTO PCI are not well‐established by these studies. Last, the available PCI equipment and stents used in some of the included studies are not the contemporary technologies available for CTO lesions; therefore, results using the newer‐generation technologies might be different from our results. Despite these limitations, the consistency of the magnitude and direction of the overall effect, and the stability of the results after the sensitivity analyses support the robustness of the conclusions and make the overall estimates justified.

### Minimalistic hybrid approach for the percutaneous treatment of chronic coronary total occlusions: an in-depth analysis of the whole algorithm [^115naBpx]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The minimalistic hybrid approach (MHA) is an algorithm to perform chronic total occlusion (CTO) percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The current study aims to evaluate the distribution of patients among the five different treatment strategies, the different techniques used in each strategy, the overall procedural success, and the safety of the MHA algorithm.

Methods

Data from a consecutive series of patients with a CTO who underwent elective PCI between February 2019 and July 2021 were prospectively collected and retrospectively analyzed.

Results

One hundred and forty-three CTOPCI in 135 patients were approached according to the MHA algorithm: 134 CTO (93.7%) were successfully recanalized and 9 procedures failed. About half of the procedures (48.3%) were approached using strategy A: antegrade "blind wiring" with contralateral retrograde options, making this the most popular strategy. A total of 89 procedures (62.2%) were completed with a single guiding catheter; in 86 (96.6%) a forearm approach was used. The remaining 54 cases were performed with dual access; in the majority of these patients (90.7%), a bilateral forearm approach was used. The only reason to use the femoral access was inadequate forearm access. One hundred and fifty-four out of 197 (78.2%) access sites were 6 French sheaths.

Conclusion

MHA is a stepwise approach focused on the forearm approach to reduce the number of access sites and catheter size used in CTOPCI while maintaining proficiency and safety. Operators should be warned that this approach should be adopted only by experienced CTO operators who master all the strategies of the classic hybrid algorithm and the forearm approach.

### Ten-year outcome of recanalization or medical therapy for concomitant chronic total occlusion after myocardial infarction [^112xjgGw]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

A concomitant chronic total coronary occlusion (CTO) is a determining finding among patients presenting with ST‐segment–elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The incidence of a concurrent CTO in patients with STEMI is ≈15%. Its presence increases the risk for cardiogenic shock and mortality and is associated with deterioration of the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). This increased risk not only affects patients with CTO in the acute phase after STEMI, but they retain a higher mortality and a higher risk for adverse outcome than patients without CTO in the years after STEMI, even after excluding early deaths. In patients with chronic coronary syndromes, randomized studies established a significant symptom relief after CTO percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), and found that patients less frequently underwent a target lesion revascularization, compared with patients treated with only optimal medical therapy. No benefit on major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) has been demonstrated. The follow‐up durations of these studies extend 3 to 5 years. In stabilized and successfully treated patients with STEMI, the safety and efficacy of early revascularization of concurrent CTO was studied in the EXPLORE (Evaluating Xience and Left Ventricular Function in PCI on Occlusions After STEMI) trial.CTO PCI did not result in higher LVEF, and the rate of MACE was low and did not differ at 4 months or 4 years follow‐up. However, the longer‐term safety and clinical benefit of CTO PCI beyond 5 years is currently undetermined. Therefore, we have extended the follow‐up of the EXPLORE trial to 10 years to investigate the long‐term clinical benefit of CTO PCI compared with medical therapy on the occurrence of MACE and on symptoms after STEMI.

### Gender differences in the prevalence and treatment of coronary chronic total occlusions [^1132ZgPC]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Gender differences exist in the presentation and outcomes of patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). Our study objective was to compare gender differences in prevalence, co-morbidities, and revascularization treatment in CAD patients with chronic total occlusions (CTOs).

Methods

A retrospective analysis using the Canadian Multicenter CTO Registry, which included 1,690 consecutive CTO patients identified at coronary angiography and a control group of 7,682 non-CTO patients.

Results

The prevalence of women in the CTO group was significantly lower compared to the control group (19% vs. 30%, P < 0.001). Within the overall CTO group, women were significantly older than men (70 ± 12 vs. 66 ± 11 years, P < 0.001) with more comorbidities, including hypertension and heart failure. Rates of PCI in the CTO group were similar between gender (10%), however, women with CTO were treated significantly less by CABG compared to men (19% vs. 27%, P = 0.003). Moreover, compared to male patients, significantly fewer women undergoing CABG had revascularization of the CTO artery (84% vs. 93%, P = 0.03). Multivariable analysis indicated that female gender (along with age, chronic renal failure, prior MI and cerebro-vascular disease) were independent predictors for not receiving CABG treatment for CTO.

Conclusions

Female gender differences exist in CTO patients with both lower prevalence of CTOs at angiography and lower revascularization rates of CTOs by CABG. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

### Lesion characteristics and procedural complications of chronic total occlusion percutaneous coronary intervention in patients with prior bypass surgery: a meta-analysis [^112Kqxqf]. Clinical Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Coronary chronic total occlusion (CTO) is characterized by complete occlusion of anterograde blood flow (TIMI grade 0 flow) in the coronary artery, presented more than 3 months. CTO percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) represents one of the most advanced fields of interventional cardiology. Owing to the complexity of CTO‐PCI, only 10%–15% of CTO patients attempted to receive interventional revascularization, and more patients are undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery.CABG significantly improved the long‐term clinical outcomes of complex coronary lesions indeed. However, CABG itself can accelerate the development of native coronary artery atherosclerosis, leading to development of a new CTO in up to 43% of the bypassed native arteries as early as 1 year after CABG. And the prevalence of native artery CTO in patients undergoing coronary angiography reaches 54% in the post‐CABG population, higher than in patients without CABG. Moreover, repeat CABG was related to worse long‐term clinical outcomes as compared to initial CABG. And saphenous vein graft PCI also has high rates of failure. Therefore, for these cases, the native arteries CTO‐PCI was preferred as a revascularization strategy.

### Increased estimated remnant-like particle cholesterol is associated with impaired coronary collateralization in patients with coronary chronic total occlusions [^1118YwNj]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Coronary chronic total occlusion (CTO) lesions refer to the coronary lesions that are completely occluded with Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) 0 flow with an estimated duration of at least 3 months and are serious clinical presentations of coronary artery disease (CAD) and need to take due attention. The success rate of recanalization of CTO lesions increased steadily owing to growing operator experience, technological improvement and evolving techniques. However, to date whether invasive strategy of CTO lesions could improve the prognosis of those patients remained to be controversial. Recently, a meta-analysis compared the treatment efficacy of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and optimal medical therapy alone and found that PCI could not improve long-term survival or decrease major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) rates in those patients. Besides, CTO-related PCI is also associated with a higher periprocedural risk. A recent trial focusing on chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients with CTO lesions undergoing PCI showed that those patients suffered higher all-cause death rates whereas the technical and procedural success rates are significantly lower than those without CKD. Hence, invasive revascularization strategy may not be the optimal option for the management of those advanced CAD patients with certain complications. Coronary collateral vessels are interarterial connections between major epicardial arteries and could compensate for myocardial ischemia and improve clinical outcomes in the event of coronary artery obstruction. The mechanism underlying coronary collateral growth (CCG) is complex. When one major epicardial artery is severely obstructed, increased fluid shear stress caused by elevated pressure gradient along the arterial network would activate endothelial cells and monocytes secreting proangiogenic factors to promote collateral growth. However, it remains elusive why some CAD patients, especially those with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) or metabolic syndrome (MS), tend to form less developed collateralization.

### Coronary chronic total occlusion on coronary CT angiography: what radiologists should know? [^112wH3EF]. Insights Into Imaging (2024). Medium credibility.

Coronary chronic total occlusion (CTO) often occurs in patients with obstructive coronary artery disease, which remains one of the greatest challenges for interventional cardiologists. Coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) with its emerging post-processing techniques can provide a detailed assessment of CTO lesions before percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), playing an important role in the clinical management of CTO PCI, from early diagnosis, pre-procedural outcome prediction, the crossing algorithm planning, intraprocedural guidance, and finally post-procedural assessment and follow-up. In addition, the feasibility of CT perfusion (CTP) in patients with CTO has been validated. Combined CCTA and CTP have the great potential to be the one-stop-shop imaging modality for assessing both anatomy and function of CTO lesions. This review aims to make radiologists understand the role of CCTA in the diagnosis and assessment of CTO lesions, thus assisting interventionalists in optimizing CTO PCI crossing strategies with the expertise of radiologists.

Critical relevance statement The anatomical features of CTO on CCTA can reveal the complexity of CTO lesions and are associated with CTO PCI outcome, thus helping interventionalists optimize CTO PCI crossing strategies.

Key points
- CTO is the common lesion in invasive coronary angiography, and CTO PCI is technically difficult and its success rate is relatively low.

- Length, collaterals, and attenuation-related signs can help distinguish CTO from subtotal occlusion.

- The anatomical features of CTO lesions can help grade the difficulty of CTO PCI and predict procedural outcomes and long-term outcomes of CTO PCI.

- The real-time fusion of CCTA with fluoroscopic angiography can be applied in highly complicated CTO lesions.

- After CTO PCI, CCTA can help guide a second CTO PCI re-entry or follow up stent patency.

### Current trends in patients with chronic total occlusions undergoing coronary CT angiography [^1118wZV6]. Heart (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Data describing the prevalence, characteristics and management of coronary chronic total occlusions (CTOs) in patients undergoing coronary CT angiography (CCTA) have not been reported. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence, characteristics and treatment strategies of CTO identified by CCTA.

Methods

We identified 23745 patients who underwent CCTA for suspected coronary artery disease (CAD) from the prospective international CCTA registry. Baseline clinical data were collected, and allocation to early coronary revascularisation performed within 90days of CCTA was determined. Multivariable hierarchical mixed-effects logistic regression reporting OR with 95% CI was performed.

Results

The prevalence of CTO was 1.4% (342/23745) in all patients and 6.2% in patients with obstructive CAD (≥ 50% stenosis). The presence of CTO was independently associated with male sex (OR 3.12, 95% CI 2.39 to 4.08, p < 0.001), smoking (OR 2.02, 95% CI 1.55 to 2.64, p < 0.001), diabetes (OR 1.60, 95% CI 1.22 to 2.11, p = 0.001), typical angina (OR 1.51, 95% CI 1.12 to 2.06, p = 0.008), hypertension (OR 1.47, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.88, p = 0.003), family history of CAD (OR 1.30, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.67, p = 0.04) and age (OR 1.06, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.07, p < 0.001). Most patients with CTO (61%) were treated medically, while 39% underwent coronary revascularisation. In patients with severe CAD (≥ 70% stenosis), CTO independently predicted revascularisation by coronary artery bypass grafting (OR 3.41, 95% CI 2.06 to 5.66, p < 0.001), but not by percutaneous coronary intervention (p = 0.83).

Conclusions

CTOs are not uncommon in a contemporary CCTA population, and are associated with age, gender, angina status and CAD risk factors. Most individuals with CTO undergoing CCTA are managed medically with higher rates of surgical revascularisation in patients with versus without CTO.

### Preprocedural planning for chronic total occlusion percutaneous coronary intervention [^117JwSQK]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Chronic total occlusions (CTO) are frequently encountered in clinical practice. Although the success rates and safety of CTO percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) have significantly improved with the development of newer equipment, use of an algorithmic approach, and advancement in procedural techniques, CTO PCI has a higher rate of complication than does non-CTO PCI. Therefore, meticulous preprocedural planning before CTO PCI is paramount to improve success and reduce the risk of complications. In this report, we review multiple aspects of preprocedural CTO PCI planning, including procedural indications, efficacy, safety, diagnostic angiography, scoring tools for procedural success and risk prediction, and preprocedural use of computed tomography coronary angiography.

### Algorithmic solutions to common problems encountered during chronic total occlusion angioplasty: the algorithms within the algorithm [^112vJkUC]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2019). Medium credibility.

Improved technical equipment, dissemination of best practices, and the importance of complete coronary revascularization have led to a renewed interest in coronary chronic total occlusion (CTO) PCI. In particular, the hybrid algorithm has been associated with increasing procedural success rates in the US. However, the hybrid algorithm only covers overarching strategies in the overall approach to these lesions. Several technical challenges can occur during execution of these approaches, each of which has several potential solutions. A systematic or algorithmic approach to dealing with these challenges could contribute to improved procedural efficiency and higher procedural success. While there have been isolated attempts in the past to codify approaches to each of these situations, there has not been a contemporary, comprehensive review of the potential solutions to these problems. We present 10 common problems encountered during CTO PCI and a consensus hierarchical approach to them.

### Effectiveness, safety, and patient reported outcomes of a planned investment procedure in higher-risk chronic total occlusion percutaneous coronary intervention: rationale and design of the invest-CTO study [^115ti7wn]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The anatomical complexity of a chronic total occlusion (CTO) correlates with procedural failure and complication rates. CTO modification after unsuccessful crossing has been associated with subsequent higher technical success rates, but complication rates remain high with this approach. While successful CTO percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has been associated with improved angina and quality of life (QOL) this has not been demonstrated in anatomically high-risk CTOs. Whether a planned CTO modification procedure, hereafter named Investment procedure, could improve patient outcomes has never been investigated.

Study Design

Invest-CTO is a prospective, single-arm, international, multicenter study, evaluating the effectiveness and safety of a planned investment procedure, with a subsequent completion CTO PCI (at 8–12 weeks), in anatomically high-risk CTOs. We will enroll 200 patients with CTOs defined as high-risk according to our Invest CTO criteria at centers in Norway and United Kingdom. Patients with aorto-ostial lesions, occlusion within a previous stent, or a prior attempt at target vessel CTO PCI within 6 months will be excluded. The co-primary endpoints are cumulative procedural success (%) after both procedures, and a composite safety endpoint at 30 days after completion CTO PCI. Patient reported outcomes (PROs), treatment satisfaction, and clinical endpoints will be reported.

Conclusion

This study will prospectively evaluate the effectiveness and safety of a planned two staged PCI procedure in the treatment of high-risk CTOs and may have the potential to change current clinical practice.

### Minimalistic hybrid approach for the percutaneous treatment of coronary chronic total occlusions: midterm follow-up of an international multicenter cohort [^116CxxDT]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

The minimalistic hybrid approach (MHA) is a recently proposed algorithm to perform chronic total occlusion (CTO) percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), reducing the overall invasiveness of the procedure without impacting the acute results. However, data on midterm results are lacking. This study aimed to evaluate the midterm clinical outcomes of a multicenter international cohort of CTO PCI treated according to the MHA. Data from a consecutive series of patients with a CTO who underwent PCI according to the MHA between February 2019 and March 2022 were prospectively collected in 3 European centers and retrospectively analyzed. The main outcome was the first occurrence of a major adverse cardiac event (MACE), defined as a composite outcome of all-cause death, any myocardial infarction, and target vessel revascularization, at the last follow-up available. A total of 212 patients were included. The majority of the patients were symptomatic for angina (Canadian Cardiovascular Society class 2 or 3: 63.7%) at the time of the index procedure. The mean Japanese-CTO and CASTLE scores were 2.1 ± 1.2 and 2.0 ± 1.3, respectively. Technical success (CTO open with optimal flow) was achieved in 198 patients (93.9%) and procedural success (technical success without in-hospital MACEs) in 195 (91.9%). At the last follow-up available (median 677 days), the cumulative incidence rate of MACEs was 11.5%; in particular, all-cause death was 7.4%, any myocardial infarction was 4.3%, and unplanned target vessel revascularization was 6.5%. In conclusion, the midterm results of the MHA seem to be in line with contemporary results of other CTO PCI algorithms, thus potentially validating the MHA as a valuable alternative, provided that interventionalists are already expert CTO operators and accustomed to the definitions and peculiarities of MHA.

### A comparison of long-term clinical outcomes between percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and medical therapy in patients with chronic total occlusion in noninfarct-related artery after PCI of acute myocardial infarction [^111DiwtE]. Clinical Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

In the contemporary practice, among patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), around 50%–60% present with multivessel disease (MVD), and 8%–13% have concurrent chronic total occlusion (CTO) lesion. Previous studies have shown that AMI with MVD was associated with worse clinical outcomes and complete revascularization in these patients will lead to reduced adverse cardiovascular events.MVD with a coexisting CTO lesion in a noninfarct‐related artery(non‐IRA) is an independent predictor for long‐term mortality in AMI patients, and one study even reported that the presence of CTO alone but not MVD is associated with long‐term mortality, indicating the strong association of CTO lesion with cardiac mortality in these patients. However, whether revascularization of CTO lesion in non‐IRA will lead to improved clinical outcomes is still controversial. Observational studies, and meta‐analysis, favor CTO‐PCI; however, the only randomized trial in this field, EXPLORE (Evaluating Xience and Left Ventricular Function in Percutaneous Coronary Intervention on Occlusions After ST‐Elevation Myocardial Infarction) trial failed to confirm the benefit of staged PCI of non‐IRA CTO in terms of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs). Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the long‐term impact of CTO revascularization in AMI patients after IRA PCI in the real world.

### Staged percutaneous intervention for concurrent chronic total occlusions in patients with ST-Segment-elevation myocardial infarction: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111mqhTD]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Contemporary research from George et al 23 also demonstrated a mortality benefit for CTO revascularization in a registry investigation of > 13 000 patients in the United Kingdom. Possible explanations for the underlying mechanism of the clinical benefit of opening CTO lesions include the improvement in blood flow in the peri‐infarct area and recovery of contractile function of the hibernated areas perfused by in the CTO territory. Other possible mechanisms include an increase in electrical stability with the associated reduction of fatal arrhythmia, and an increased tolerance to further coronary ischemic events. The overall benefit of a successful PCI could be translated to improvement of LVEF, avoiding left ventricular remodeling, and subsequent worsening LVEF and development of HF.

The results of our analysis do not mirror those of the only RCT to evaluate this topic. The EXPLORE (Evaluating Xience and Left Ventricular Function in Percutaneous Coronary Intervention on Occlusions After ST‐Segment–Elevation Myocardial Infarction) trial randomized patients presenting with acute STEMI and concurrent CTO in an nIRA to receive either early revascularization (within 1 week) or conservative (non‐PCI) therapy. 10 They reported a relatively high level of successful CTO PCI (77%). However, there was no significant improvement in cardiac deaths, recurrent MI, MACE, or LVEF. The recently reported findings of the DECISION‐CTO (Optimal Medical Therapy With or Without Stenting For Coronary Chronic Total Occlusion) trial by Park et al 24 call into question the value of CTO PCI in general. The DECISION‐CTO study evaluated outcomes in patients without ACS who underwent revascularization of CTO. They demonstrated that optimal medical therapy was noninferior to CTO PCI in 834 patients randomized to each arm. However, they excluded patients with LVEF < 30% — a group of patients who may derive the most benefit from CTO PCI. Of note, this trial was stopped early secondary to slow enrollment. EuroCTO (Randomized Multicentre Trial to Evaluate the Utilization of Revascularization or Optimal Medical Therapy for the Treatment of Chronic Total Coronary Occlusions) showed a high procedural success rate of CTO PCI with an overall low procedural risk. Also, there was an improvement in clinical symptoms in patients treated with PCI compared with optimal medical therapy based on the Seattle Angina Questionnaire, subscales of physical limitation, and angina frequency. The PCI group also showed a trend towards improved quality of life and significantly greater absolute freedom from angina. 25

### Antegrade techniques for chronic total occlusion percutaneous coronary intervention [^116h8iAo]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Antegrade techniques are the foundation of chronic total occlusion (CTO) percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Antegrade wiring with the intent to achieve an intraplaque guidewire tracking is not always feasible, and crossing into the extraplaque space with subsequent reentry (antegrade dissection and reentry), might be needed, particularly in more complex occlusions. The present article reviews in detail the antegrade approaches to CTO PCI, focusing on equipment, techniques, and overcoming challenges.

### Percutaneous coronary intervention versus optimal medical therapy for chronic total coronary occlusion with well-developed collaterals [^113Bz81L]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

The success rate of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for chronic total occlusion (CTO) lesions have been increased by the advancement of operator's skill, experience with intervention techniques (anterograde and retrograde approaches, wire manipulations techniques, and so on), and device technology (improved dedicated CTO guidewires, microcatheters, CTO balloons, and coronary stents). 1, 2, 3, 4 Several studies demonstrated that successful CTO intervention was associated with improved survival rates and angina symptom relief when compared with the failed CTO intervention. 1, 4, 5, 6 Despite previous study results, the proportion of patients who underwent PCI for CTO lesions was still lower, 7, 8 and current guidelines recommend that the physicians should consider the clinical benefits regarding clinical, angiographic, and technical parameters when determining whether or not to perform PCI in patients with CTO lesions. 9, 10

The coronary collateral circulation has been known as an alternative route of blood supply to the occluded segment of the distal myocardium area. Well‐developed collateral flow is a positive predictive value for the possibility of myocardium viability, and it has been an important factor for a physician's decision whether or not open up for the CTO lesion, particularly in CTO patients with limited symptoms and preserved left ventricular (LV) function. 11 Also, well‐developed collateral flow contribute clinical benefits in reducing the incidence of cardiac deaths and cardiovascular events in chronic stable angina patients. Furthermore, it is associated with beneficial effect after acute ischemic status in reducing infarct size and preserving LV function compared with CTO patients with poor‐developed collateral flow 12, 13 However, there is limited evidence regarding the impact of PCI in patients with CTO with abundant collateral circulation compared with the optimal medical therapy (OMT) alone. Thus, the purpose of this study is to identify the impact of PCI on long‐term clinical outcomes in patients with at least 1 CTO target vessel and well‐developed collateral flow compared with OMT alone strategy in the drug‐eluting‐stent era.

### Ten-year outcome of recanalization or medical therapy for concomitant chronic total occlusion after myocardial infarction [^1131xGpi]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

The longest follow‐up currently available of randomized studies of patients undergoing either CTO PCI or conservative treatment extends to 3 to 5 years. The EuroCTO trial (n = 396), which was prematurely halted due to slow enrollment and limit of financial funds, has recently published its 3‐year safety outcome. No difference was found of elective CTO PCI in stable patients for the occurrence of cardiovascular death or nonfatal MI. However, patients after CTO PCI experienced less angina, received less antianginal medications, and had fewer ischemia‐driven target‐lesion revascularizations. The DECISION‐CTO trial (Drug‐Eluting Stent Implantation Versus Optimal Medical Treatment in Patients with Chronic Total Occlusion; n = 834), which was also prematurely halted, demonstrated no clinical difference on MACE or symptomatology 3 years after randomization to either CTO PCI or no‐CTO PCI. The COMET‐CTO trial (Comparison of Optimal Medical Therapy with Percutaneous Recanalization of Chronic Total Occlusion; n = 100) published its long‐term outcomes at 56 months follow‐up, and no differences in MACE or mortality were observed. Additionally, there were no differences in quality of life or angina measures. Nonetheless, the abovementioned registry by Park et al demonstrated that in the early years after CTO revascularization, no survival benefit was apparent, whereas the survival benefit mainly occurred 3 to 10 years after CTO PCI. Therefore, the follow‐up beyond 5 years of randomized studies is warranted.
