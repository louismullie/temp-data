## Question

Difficulty is sleeping due to gasping for air, what could be the diagnosis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what diagnosis to consider for difficulty sleeping due to gasping for air. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the most likely diagnosis and why. Then, I should verify the key differentials and how to distinguish them. Next, I will review the diagnostic approach, including when to use home sleep apnea testing versus in-lab polysomnography. Finally, I will consider red flags, comorbidities, and immediate next steps, making sure I anchor each assertion to guidelines and high-quality evidence.

> Let me first confirm the leading diagnosis. Nocturnal gasping or choking is among the most specific symptoms for obstructive sleep apnea, with a summary likelihood ratio around 3.3 in high-quality evidence, which meaningfully increases the post-test probability of OSA when present [^5a964f1a]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify that this symptom clusters with other OSA features. Indeed, guidelines list awakening with gasping or choking alongside loud snoring, witnessed apneas, and excessive daytime sleepiness as core clinical features that should prompt diagnostic testing for OSA [^4e7b8941] [^e69cff76] [^7d5133a2].

> I need to check the pathophysiology to ensure internal consistency. OSA is characterized by repetitive upper airway collapse during sleep, producing apneas and hypopneas that fragment sleep and cause intermittent hypoxemia; gasping represents a compensatory arousal restoring airway patency, which aligns with the clinical picture of abrupt awakenings with choking or air hunger [^af794e86] [^a1926c7a]. Wait, let me verify the diagnostic thresholds so I don't misstate severity. OSA is diagnosed with an AHI ≥ 15 regardless of symptoms, or AHI ≥ 5 with compatible symptoms, which frames how we interpret sleep study results once testing is pursued [^4e7b8941] [^aabc12a3].

> Next, I should review differentials and make sure I'm not missing less common but important causes. Central sleep apnea can present with nocturnal dyspnea and gasping, particularly in heart failure or opioid users, though the pattern is typically of reduced or absent respiratory effort rather than obstructive struggle; nonetheless, symptom overlap exists and requires polysomnography to distinguish [^55c097ef] [^1fda65e9]. Laryngospasm or gastroesophageal reflux–related choking during sleep can mimic OSA and may occur without classic GERD symptoms; case series and pediatric literature highlight this, and evaluation may require PSG with adjuncts when seizures or reflux are suspected [^85f7f964] [^9a263510]. But wait, what if the patient has COPD or another hypoventilation syndrome? COPD-related nocturnal breathlessness and gas exchange disturbances are common, yet the gasping phenotype is less typical than in OSA; still, comorbid OSA is frequent in COPD, so I should keep overlap in mind and tailor testing accordingly [^6e20fb3e] [^994fb8be].

> I will now examine the diagnostic approach, and I need to ensure I align with guidelines. For adults with symptoms suggesting increased risk of moderate to severe OSA, home sleep apnea testing is appropriate if the patient is uncomplicated and there is no suspicion of non-obstructive sleep disorders; if HSAT is negative, inconclusive, or technically inadequate, in-lab polysomnography should follow [^e334f962] [^f40343e6]. Hold on, I should verify exceptions where PSG is preferred first-line: significant cardiorespiratory disease, suspected hypoventilation, neuromuscular disease, chronic opioid use, severe insomnia, or concern for other sleep disorders warrant direct PSG rather than HSAT [^32a0b4c4] [^cc40d3db]. I should double-check that both pathways lead to equivalent clinical outcomes; meta-analytic data show similar improvements in sleepiness whether diagnosis is made by HSAT or PSG, supporting the HSAT-first strategy in appropriate patients [^f1d664e6].

> Let me consider screening tools and pretest probability, but I need to be careful not to overstate their diagnostic value. STOP-Bang is a practical screen that captures snoring, tiredness, observed apneas, blood pressure, BMI, age, neck circumference, and gender; a score ≥ 3 suggests high risk and supports proceeding to diagnostic testing, but it does not diagnose OSA by itself [^02bcfa2d]. I should confirm that guidelines advise against diagnosing OSA with questionnaires alone; definitive diagnosis requires PSG or HSAT, so screening tools should only guide test selection, not replace it [^49aedf5d] [^f40343e6].

> Next, I should review comorbidities and red flags that would modify testing or urgency. Obesity, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, heart failure, type 2 diabetes, stroke, treatment-resistant hypertension, and high-risk occupational drivers are high-risk groups in whom OSA evaluation is particularly important, and the presence of these comorbidities may influence the choice of diagnostic modality and the threshold for treatment [^2bedb538] [^e235f7b8]. Wait, let me verify the cardiovascular implications; untreated OSA is associated with increased risks of hypertension, arrhythmias, heart failure, and cerebrovascular disease, reinforcing the need for timely diagnosis and management when symptoms are present [^abc9aced].

> I should confirm immediate next steps so the recommendation is actionable. Given nocturnal gasping as a key symptom, I would obtain a focused sleep history covering snoring, witnessed apneas, daytime sleepiness, nocturia, morning headaches, and sleep fragmentation, and I would perform a targeted exam including BMI, neck circumference, and upper airway anatomy; if risk is elevated, I would order HSAT in an uncomplicated patient or proceed to PSG if complicating factors are present, with a low threshold to escalate to in-lab testing if HSAT is negative but suspicion remains high [^e69cff76] [^e334f962] [^f40343e6]. Hold on, I should verify that I am not implying treatment yet; diagnosis must precede therapy, and once confirmed, evidence-based options include CPAP, oral appliances, or selected surgical approaches tailored to anatomy and patient preference, with follow-up to assess symptom control and adherence [^35b5773f] [^03eb50bf].

> In summary, I need to ensure the conclusion is precise and reference-aligned. The most likely diagnosis for difficulty sleeping due to gasping for air is obstructive sleep apnea, given the high diagnostic weight of nocturnal choking or gasping and the clustering of classic OSA symptoms; confirmatory testing with HSAT or PSG is indicated based on comorbidity profile and pretest probability, and alternative explanations such as central sleep apnea, laryngospasm, or COPD-related nocturnal symptoms should be considered when the phenotype or risk factors deviate from typical OSA presentations [^5a964f1a] [^4e7b8941] [^e334f962] [^55c097ef] [^6e20fb3e].

---

The most likely diagnosis for difficulty sleeping due to gasping for air is **obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)** [^5a964f1a], characterized by repeated upper airway collapse during sleep, causing brief awakenings with gasping or choking [^4e7b8941]. Other considerations include **central sleep apnea** (especially with heart failure or opioid use) [^55c097ef], **nocturnal asthma** [^notfound], **GERD-related laryngospasm** [^85f7f964], and **panic disorder** [^3306121d]. Confirm the diagnosis with **home sleep apnea testing** [^e334f962] or **polysomnography** [^02338864], and initiate CPAP therapy if OSA is confirmed [^aabc12a3].

## Differential diagnosis

| **Diagnosis** | **Clinical features** | **Pathophysiology** |
|-|-|-|
| Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) | - Loud snoring <br/> - Witnessed apneas <br/> - Nocturnal gasping/choking <br/> - Daytime sleepiness <br/> - Obesity <br/> - Hypertension | Repeated upper airway collapse during sleep, causing hypoxemia and arousals [^af794e86] |
| Central sleep apnea (CSA) | - Nocturnal gasping <br/> - Frequent awakenings <br/> - Daytime sleepiness <br/> - Heart failure <br/> - Opioid use | Loss of central respiratory drive, causing periodic breathing and arousals [^55c097ef] |
| Nocturnal asthma | - Nighttime wheezing <br/> - Cough <br/> - Gasping <br/> - Allergy history | Bronchoconstriction and inflammation during sleep [^notfound] |
| GERD-related laryngospasm | - Nocturnal choking <br/> - Gasping <br/> - Acid reflux symptoms | Reflux-triggered laryngospasm causing transient airway obstruction [^85f7f964] |
| Panic disorder | - Nocturnal panic attacks <br/> - Gasping <br/> - Palpitations <br/> - Anxiety | Hyperventilation and heightened anxiety during sleep [^3306121d] |

---

## Diagnostic approach

- **Clinical evaluation**: Detailed sleep history, physical exam (BMI, neck circumference, upper airway anatomy) [^e69cff76].
- **Screening tools**: STOP-Bang questionnaire to assess OSA risk [^02bcfa2d].
- **Diagnostic testing**: Home sleep apnea testing (HSAT) [^e334f962] or polysomnography (PSG) [^02338864] to confirm OSA or CSA.
- **Additional tests**: Spirometry for asthma, ambulatory pH monitoring for GERD, psychiatric evaluation for panic disorder.

---

## Management

- **OSA**: Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) [^aabc12a3], lifestyle changes, oral appliances, or surgery [^03eb50bf].
- **CSA**: Treat underlying causes (e.g. heart failure), CPAP, adaptive servo-ventilation (ASV), or oxygen therapy [^55c097ef].
- **Nocturnal asthma**: Inhaled corticosteroids, bronchodilators, allergen avoidance.
- **GERD**: Proton pump inhibitors, lifestyle modifications, head-of-bed elevation.
- **Panic disorder**: Cognitive-behavioral therapy, anxiolytics.

---

Difficulty sleeping due to gasping for air most often reflects **OSA**, but CSA, nocturnal asthma, GERD-related laryngospasm, and panic disorder should be considered. Confirm with HSAT or PSG [^e334f962] and tailor therapy to the underlying cause.

## References

### Does this patient have obstructive sleep apnea? the rational clinical examination systematic review [^5a964f1a]. JAMA (2013). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Obstructive sleep apnea is a common disease, responsible for daytime sleepiness. Prior to referring patients for definitive testing, the likelihood of obstructive sleep apnea should be established in the clinical examination.

Objective

To systematically review the clinical examination accuracy in diagnosing obstructive sleep apnea.

Data Sources

MEDLINE and reference lists from articles were searched from 1966 to June 2013. Titles and abstracts (n = 4449) were reviewed for eligibility and appraised for evidence levels.

Study Selection

For inclusion, studies must have used full, attended nocturnal polysomnography for the reference standard (n = 42).

Main Outcomes and Measures

Community and referral-based prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea; accuracy of symptoms and signs for the diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea.

Results

The prevalence of sleep apnea in community-screened patients is 2% to 14% (sample sizes 360–1741) and 21% to 90% (sample sizes 42–2677) for patients referred for sleep evaluation. The prevalence varies based on the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) threshold used for the evaluation (≥ 5 events/h, prevalence 14%; ≥ 15/h, prevalence 6%) and whether the disease definition requires symptoms in addition to an abnormal AHI (≥ 5/h with symptoms, prevalence 2%-4%). Among patients referred for sleep evaluation, those with sleep apnea weighed more (summary body mass index, 31.4; 95% CI, 30.5–32.2) than those without sleep apnea (summary BMI, 28.3; 95% CI, 27.6–29.0; P < .001 for the comparison). The most useful observation for identifying patients with obstructive sleep apnea was nocturnal choking or gasping (summary likelihood ratio [LR], 3.3; 95% CI, 2.1–4.6) when the diagnosis was established by AHI ≥ 10/h). Snoring is common in sleep apnea patients but is not useful for establishing the diagnosis (summary LR, 1.1; 95% CI, 1.0–1.1). Patients with mild snoring and body mass index lower than 26 are unlikely to have moderate or severe obstructive sleep apnea (LR, 0.07; 95% CI, 0.03–0.19 at threshold of AHI ≥ 15/h).

Conclusions and Relevance

Nocturnal gasping or choking is the most reliable indicator of obstructive sleep apnea, whereas snoring is not very specific. The clinical examination of patients with suspected obstructive sleep apnea is useful for selecting patients for more definitive testing.

### Clinical guideline for the evaluation, management and long-term care of obstructive sleep apnea in adults [^4e7b8941]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2009). Medium credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in adults — diagnostic definitions and thresholds are specified as follows: Clinically, OSA is defined by daytime sleepiness, loud snoring, witnessed breathing interruptions, or awakening due to gasping or choking in the presence of at least 5 obstructive respiratory events (apneas, hypopneas or respiratory effort related arousals) per hour of sleep, and the presence of 15 or more obstructive respiratory events per hour of sleep in the absence of sleep related symptoms is also sufficient for diagnosis. Epidemiologically, OSA affects at least 2% to 4% of the adult population.

Approach to Workup and Diagnosis of OSA

A careful clinical assessment of symptoms, comorbidities, medication use, health-related behaviors, together with a sleep and family history, and findings on examination as outlined here, selects those who should undergo overnight PSG, which is required for the diagnosis of OSA. Diagnosis and severity are based on the AHI, which measures the frequency of apneas (complete cessation of airflow) and hypopneas (partial reduction in airflow) per hour of sleep. OSA is diagnosed if the AHI is 15 or greater, regardless of symptoms, or if the AHI is between 5 and 15 (mild OSA) with a supportive clinical presentation. An AHI ≥ 15 and < 30 and AHI ≥ 30 are classified as moderate and severe OSA, respectively.

A detailed approach to a sleep history can be found here:

Clinical Presentation and Assessment

Symptoms

The symptoms of OSA are documented in a recent consensus statement and summarized in Table 1. There are no pathognomonic symptoms. Regular snoring, witnessed breathing pauses, and regular nocturnal gasping episodes are most strongly associated with OSA. However, patients with severe OSA may report few, minor, or no symptoms and each of the symptoms apart from those listed have multiple causes other than OSA. Stress is likely a major factor in the presence and severity of symptoms attributable OSA.

Table 1.
OSA symptoms — population and OSA prevalence

Presence of OSA-associated comorbidities.

The comorbidities that occur most frequently with OSA are shown in Table 2. A careful clinical evaluation should be undertaken to determine whether these conditions are present and, if so, their severity.

Table 2.
Common chronic disorders associated with OSA

Medication use

Treatment of hypogonadal men with testosterone transiently worsens OSA. Medication-induced weight gain increases OSA severity. The effects of atypical antipsychotics are disproportionate to their weight-increasing effects. Benzodiazepines increase the risk and severity of OSA, an effect related to proximity of use and cumulative dose. Opioids cause or exacerbate central sleep apnea but their effects on OSA are unresolved.

Alcohol and Smoking

Alcohol relaxes airway muscles, reduces sensitivity to apnea, and causes weight gain. A systematic review and meta-analysis showed that consumption of any alcohol increases the risk of OSA by 25% (any compared with none or high compared with low intake), independent of obesity.

Smoking causes disordered sleep structure, high arousal index, hypoxemia during sleep, increased nasal resistance, and airway collapsibility and increases the incidence and severity of OSA. Smokers also have higher ESS scores.

### COVID-19 illness in relation to sleep and burnout [^fa1a2c47]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2021). High credibility.

COVID-19 cases, severity, duration and controls

COVID-19 cases were defined as either symptomatic cases, answering in the affirmative to the question 'Since exposure, have you personally experienced symptoms consistent with a diagnosis of COVID-19 (fever, coughing, fatigue, loss of taste or smell)?', or asymptomatic cases, a positive COVID-19 PCR or antibody test result without COVID-19-like symptoms (fever, cough, fatigue, loss of taste or smell). In the present study, 568 participants were classified as COVID-19 cases based on these criteria. Controls were defined as having a negative COVID-19 test result and no symptoms consistent with COVID-19 illness. Of the participants, 2316 were classified as controls. We used symptoms to define COVID-19 cases because many HCWs in Europe and the USA did not have adequate and timely access to COVID-19 testing in the early phases of the COVID-19 pandemic, when this study was carried out. We considered symptoms of COVID-19 important in defining COVID-19 cases because absence of testing, testing negative for antibodies, or negative viral PCR if not administered in the proper time frame, does not suggest that an HCW, in fact, did not have COVID-19 illness.

In terms of severity of COVID-19 illness, participants had five options to choose from: (1) very mild: asymptomatic or nearly asymptomatic; (2) mild: fever < 38°C (without treatment), with or without cough, no dyspnoea, no gasping and no abnormal imaging findings; (3) moderate: fever, respiratory symptoms and/or imaging findings of pneumonia; (4) severe: meet any of the following: (a) respiratory distress, with respiratory rate ≥ 30 times per minute, (b) low oxygen saturation < 93% at rest and (c) partial pressure of oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen ≤ 300 mm Hg; and (5) critical: respiratory failure needing mechanical assistance, intensive care unit admission, shock or extrapulmonary organ failure. No participant reported 'critical' severity of COVID-19 illness.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) diagnostic criteria and alternate names are provided. Alternate names include "OSA syndrome, sleep apnea, sleep apnea syndrome, obstructive apnea, sleep disordered breathing, obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome". Diagnosis requires "((A and B) or C) + D must be met". Criterion A is "The presence of one or more of the following:" including "The patient complains of sleepiness, fatigue, insomnia, or other symptoms leading to impaired sleep-related quality of life", "The patient wakes with breath holding, gasping, or choking", or "The bed partner or other observer reports habitual snoring or breathing interruptions during the patient's sleep". For criterion B, "PSG or HSAT demonstrates: Five or more predominantly obstructive respiratory events (obstructive and mixed apneas, hypopneas, or respiratory effort related arousals [RERAs]) per hour of sleep during a PSG or per hour of monitoring (HSAT)". Alternatively, criterion C requires "Fifteen or more predominantly obstructive respiratory events (obstructive and mixed apneas, hypopneas, or respiratory effort related arousals [RERAs]) per hour of sleep during a PSG or per hour of monitoring (HSAT)". Criterion D states, "The symptoms are not better explained by another current sleep disorder, medical disorder, medication or substance use".

### Clinical practice guideline for diagnostic testing for adult obstructive sleep apnea: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^e334f962]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Home sleep apnea testing (HSAT) for adult obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) — Recommendations 2 and 3 state that "polysomnography, or home sleep apnea testing with a technically adequate device, be used for the diagnosis of OSA" in "uncomplicated adult patients" with signs and symptoms indicating "an increased risk of moderate to severe OSA" (STRONG), and that "if a single home sleep apnea test is negative, inconclusive or technically inadequate, polysomnography be performed" (STRONG). Remarks define an "uncomplicated adult patient" by the absence of conditions that place the patient at increased risk of non‑obstructive sleep‑disordered breathing, concern for significant non‑respiratory sleep disorders that require evaluation or interfere with HSAT accuracy, and environmental or personal factors that preclude adequate HSAT data acquisition and interpretation; increased risk is indicated by excessive daytime sleepiness plus at least two of habitual loud snoring, witnessed apnea or gasping or choking, or diagnosed hypertension. Operational specifications state HSAT is to be administered by an accredited sleep center under supervision of a board‑certified sleep medicine physician or a board‑eligible sleep medicine provider, that a single HSAT recording is conducted over at least one night, that a technically adequate HSAT device incorporates nasal pressure, chest and abdominal respiratory inductance plethysmography, and oximetry, or else PAT with oximetry and actigraphy, and that a technically adequate diagnostic test includes a minimum of 4 hours of technically adequate oximetry and flow data.

### Sleep-related hypoventilation / hypoxemic syndromes [^cbca8e53]. Chest (2007). Low credibility.

The latest edition of The International Classification of Sleep Disorders: Diagnostic and Coding Manual subsumes a broad range of disorders under the heading "Sleep Related Hypoventilation/Hypoxemic Syndromes". Some are quite common, such as COPD with worsening gas exchange during sleep; while some are exceedingly rare, such as congenital central hypoventilation syndrome. All share the attribute of abnormal gas exchange that worsens, or may only be present, during sleep. The sleep state, the sleeping posture, and the circadian rhythm driving sleep all may affect respiration by altering control of breathing and/or pulmonary mechanics. These changes are largely inconsequential in the normal individual but interact with respiratory, neurologic, or neuromuscular disease to manifest as the sleep-related hypoventilation/hypoxemic syndromes. In addition to optimal treatment of the underlying disorder (when known and when possible), treatment usually involves nocturnal ventilatory support that is now most commonly provided by noninvasive positive pressure ventilation.

### Clinical guideline for the evaluation, management and long-term care of obstructive sleep apnea in adults [^2bedb538]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2009). Medium credibility.

History and physical examination — sleep history is typically obtained during routine health maintenance evaluation, during evaluation of symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea, or as part of the comprehensive evaluation of patients at high risk for OSA; high-risk patients include those who are obese, those with congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, treatment refractory hypertension, type 2 diabetes, stroke, nocturnal dysrhythmias, pulmonary hypertension, high-risk driving populations (such as commercial truck drivers), and those being evaluated for bariatric surgery (Consensus). During routine health maintenance, questions should include a history of snoring and daytime sleepiness and an evaluation for obesity, retrognathia, or hypertension (Consensus). A comprehensive sleep history in a patient suspected of OSA should include snoring, witnessed apneas, gasping/choking episodes, excessive sleepiness not explained by other factors with assessment by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, total sleep amount, nocturia, morning headaches, sleep fragmentation/sleep maintenance insomnia, and decreased concentration and memory (Consensus).

### Clinical practice guideline for diagnostic testing for adult obstructive sleep apnea: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^f40343e6]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Adult obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) diagnostic algorithm — initial evaluation and test selection begins with clinical suspicion based on a comprehensive sleep evaluation, and "Clinical tools, questionnaires and prediction algorithms should not be used to diagnose OSA in adults, in the absence of PSG or HSAT". Patients with "signs and symptoms that indicate an increased risk of moderate to severe OSA" — defined as excessive daytime sleepiness plus "at least two of the following three criteria: habitual loud snoring; witnessed apnea or gasping or choking; or diagnosed hypertension" — should then be assessed for conditions that "preclude the adequate acquisition and interpretation of data from HSAT". If such conditions are present or if increased-risk criteria are not met, "Perform PSG by an accredited sleep center under the supervision of a board-certified sleep physician". If increased risk is present and no such exclusions apply, "Perform HSAT, administered by an accredited sleep center under the supervision of a board-certified sleep physician", which is "based on conducting a single HSAT recording over at least one night" using devices with a "minimum of the following sensors: nasal pressure, chest and abdominal respiratory inductance plethysmography (RIP) and oximetry; or peripheral arterial tonometry (PAT) with oximetry and actigraphy".

### An official American Thoracic Society statement: update on the mechanisms, assessment, and management of dyspnea [^e2e51e60]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Dyspnea evaluation — clinical categories and diagnostic value of descriptors include two major patient categories: those with new onset of breathing discomfort for whom the underlying cause has not yet been determined and those with known cardiovascular, respiratory, or neuromuscular disease who are experiencing worsening dyspnea; for the former, evaluation focuses on discovering an underlying abnormality or diagnosis, and for the latter the goal is to discern deterioration of a known disorder or emergence of a new problem. In new-onset dyspnea, the history and physical examination remain the mainstays of diagnostic evaluation, and when diagnosis remains elusive, specialty referral (e.g., pulmonologist, cardiologist, or multidisciplinary dyspnea clinic) may help identify a potentially treatable underlying cause. In most cardiopulmonary diseases both increased ventilatory demand and altered ventilatory mechanics are present, whereas in some nonpathological circumstances (e.g., at altitude or during pregnancy) increased drive predominates; patient words or phrases describing the quality of breathing discomfort may provide insight into pathophysiological mechanisms, with chest tightness relatively specific for dyspnea due to bronchoconstriction, sensations of "air hunger" and "inability to get a deep breath" probably representing increased drive to breathe plus limited tidal volume and being common with dynamic hyperinflation and restrictive mechanics, and sensations of effort, suffocation, and rapid breathing characterizing CO2-induced panic attacks but being nonspecific; linguistic and cultural differences can affect symptom characterization, and some patients have difficulty grasping the concept of "quality" of their breathing sensations.

### On the cutting edge of obstructive sleep apnoea: where next? [^a797e91e]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnoea is a common disease that is now more widely recognised because of the rise in prevalence and the increasingly compelling data that shows major neurocognitive and cardiovascular sequelae. At the same time, the clinical practice of sleep medicine is changing rapidly, with novel diagnostics and treatments that have established a home-based (rather than laboratory-based) management approach. We review the most recent insights and discoveries in obstructive sleep apnoea, with a focus on diagnostics and therapeutics. As will be discussed, management of obstructive sleep apnoea could soon transition from a so-called one size fits all approach to an individualised approach.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^6e20fb3e]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Dyspnea in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) — Dyspnea is a cardinal symptom of COPD and a major cause of the disability and anxiety associated with the disease, and it comprises a sensory and an affective component. Typically, COPD patients describe dyspnea as a sense of increased effort to breathe, chest heaviness, air hunger, or gasping, and it is highly prevalent across all stages of airflow obstruction and occurs particularly during exertion or physical activity, with moderate-to-severe dyspnea reported by > 40% of patients diagnosed with COPD in primary care. Dyspnea is complex with mechanisms including impaired respiratory mechanics as a consequence of airflow obstruction and lung hyperinflation, gas exchange abnormalities, peripheral muscle dysfunction related to deconditioning (and systemic inflammation in some patients), psychological distress, dysfunctional breathing, cardiovascular or other comorbid diseases. Dyspnea measured by the 5-level modified Medical Research Council scale is integrated in the GOLD clinical classification scheme because patients with high dyspnea scores incur higher healthcare resource utilization and costs, and dyspnea in daily life can be measured by a number of detailed questionnaires that are more discriminant and sensitive to change.

### More than sleepiness: prevalence and relevance of nonclassical symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea [^abbac14e]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common sleep disorder and affects nearly one billion people worldwide, with substantial morbidity, mortality and financial and societal costs. It is characterized by the presence of repetitive episodes of partial or complete collapse of the upper airway during sleep. The two major pathophysiological consequences of OSA are arterial oxygen desaturation and sleep fragmentation. The typical OSA syndrome is represented by an overweigh male patient with reported heavy snoring and witnessed apneas, nocturnal gasping, excessive daytime sleepiness and cardiovascular and metabolic comorbidities. This picture is contrasted by a subgroup of individuals who do not report discomfort at night, do not complain about sleepiness at all or have unusual symtoms such as bruxism, morning headache, nocturia, acid reflux, chronic cough and dysphagia, which are not directly linked with the nocturnal breathing problem. Because of these nonspecific symptoms, OSA remains often undiagnosed. Moreover, intrinsic sleep disorders can coincide or may be provoked by OSA, including nightmares, chronic insomnia disorder, periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD) and restless legs syndrome (RLS), amongst others. When these entities occur together, implications for therapeutic management may arise. This review will present actual data with respect to the prevalence of these atypical symptoms and concommittant sleep disorders, and clinical relevance.

### Clinical overview and treatment options for non-skeletal manifestations of mucopolysaccharidosis type IVA [^4a5cf5cb]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2013). Low credibility.

Additional measurements should include assessment of lung size. Spirometry is a readily available technique utilized to measure the vital capacity (VC; the maximum amount of air that can be inhaled/exhaled from full inflation to maximum deflation) providing an indication of the size of the lungs. The "gold standard" assessment of lung restriction is by measurement of total lung capacity (TLC). This can be assessed by a variety of techniques either physiological, including whole body plethysmography, gas (typically helium) dilution, and nitrogen washout, or by radiographic means [conventional chest radiographs or computerized tomography (CT)]. In an ideal world both plethysmography and gas dilution/nitrogen washout tests should be performed, however this may be limited by the availability of equipment and local expertise. In patients with limited ability to co-operate (such as children 2–5 years of age), radiographic techniques may offer an alternative method of assessment (Clausen).

Sleep studies should be performed in addition to lung function assessments. Performance of a formal sleep study is recommended at diagnosis and should be repeated whenever SDB is suspected. Symptoms suggestive of SDB, such as apneas, gasping respirations, snoring, difficult wakening, daytime somnolence, and restless sleep, should be assessed as part of the clinical evaluation of all patients at least annually. Overnight sleep studies can be used to both diagnose the type and severity of SDB and to evaluate nocturnal ventilatory treatments for the underlying respiratory disorder.

All patients should be asked about symptoms of respiratory insufficiency such as dyspnea; however, symptoms may be minimally perceived when exercise capacity is limited secondary to reduced endurance. Objective assessment of CO₂ retention is best accomplished by analysis of arterial blood gases, however, this test may not be readily available in some outpatient settings. Alternatively, capnography may be used as a surrogate measure, or elevation of serum bicarbonate concentration in venous blood can be used as a screening test for chronic hypoventilation; an elevated serum bicarbonate concentration (> 27 mEq/L) may be a marker of renal compensation for chronic CO₂ retention.

Lastly, spiral CT of the chest can be useful in detecting tracheomalacia and should be considered at least before major surgery to uncover upper airways abnormalities (Shih et al.).

Panic disorder and air hunger descriptors — unexplained dyspnea is one of the hallmarks of panic disorder, and clustering of suffocating, smothering, and air hunger has been observed in patients with panic disorder in response to breath-holding and carbon dioxide (CO₂) rebreathing or challenge; similar clustering has been reported in idiopathic hyperventilation without cardiopulmonary or neuromuscular disease. This suggests that, in susceptible individuals, air hunger may occur even in the absence of reduced ventilatory capacity, with possible roles for excessive ventilatory drive, impaired perception of achieved ventilation, increased sensitivity to CO₂ (potentially with a genetic component), or excessive responses to cerebral acidosis or hypoxia due to hyperventilation-induced hypocapnia. Whatever term is used, it represents a perception that the drive to breathe is not being matched by adequate pulmonary ventilation.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the management of chronic insomnia disorder and obstructive sleep apnea [^abc9aced]. VA/DoD (2025). High credibility.

A. General information on obstructive sleep apnea explains that obstructive sleep apnea is a very common and serious sleep disorder which affects many military personnel and Veterans, and snoring is one common symptom but not all patients with sleep apnea snore. Other symptoms include pauses in breathing while asleep, trouble staying asleep, using the bathroom frequently at night, morning headaches, morning dry mouth, morning sore throat, and daytime sleepiness. What defines sleep apnea is decreased breathing – either a partial (hypopnea) or complete absence of breathing (apnea) – that occurs while sleeping, during which oxygen levels can decrease (hypoxia) and carbon dioxide levels can increase (hypercapnia), with serious medical consequences such as high blood pressure, heart failure, irregular heart rhythms, stroke, memory impairment, and death. Multiple awakenings during the night also lead to excessive daytime sleepiness and increased risk for motor vehicle accidents. We will need to obtain a sleep study to confirm this diagnosis. There are effective treatments for sleep apnea.

### Clinical practice guideline for diagnostic testing for adult obstructive sleep apnea: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^32a0b4c4]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

This guideline establishes clinical practice recommendations for the diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in adults and is intended for use in conjunction with other American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) guidelines on the evaluation and treatment of sleep-disordered breathing in adults.

Methods

The AASM commissioned a task force of experts in sleep medicine. A systematic review was conducted to identify studies, and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) process was used to assess the evidence. The task force developed recommendations and assigned strengths based on the quality of evidence, the balance of benefits and harms, patient values and preferences, and resource use. In addition, the task force adopted foundational recommendations from prior guidelines as "good practice statements", that establish the basis for appropriate and effective diagnosis of OSA. The AASM Board of Directors approved the final recommendations.

Recommendations

The following recommendations are intended as a guide for clinicians diagnosing OSA in adults. Under GRADE, a STRONG recommendation is one that clinicians should follow under most circumstances. A WEAK recommendation reflects a lower degree of certainty regarding the outcome and appropriateness of the patient-care strategy for all patients. The ultimate judgment regarding propriety of any specific care must be made by the clinician in light of the individual circumstances presented by the patient, available diagnostic tools, accessible treatment options, and resources. Good Practice Statements: Diagnostic testing for OSA should be performed in conjunction with a comprehensive sleep evaluation and adequate follow-up. Polysomnography is the standard diagnostic test for the diagnosis of OSA in adult patients in whom there is a concern for OSA based on a comprehensive sleep evaluation. Recommendations: We recommend that clinical tools, questionnaires and prediction algorithms not be used to diagnose OSA in adults, in the absence of polysomnography or home sleep apnea testing. (STRONG). We recommend that polysomnography, or home sleep apnea testing with a technically adequate device, be used for the diagnosis of OSA in uncomplicated adult patients presenting with signs and symptoms that indicate an increased risk of moderate to severe OSA. (STRONG). We recommend that if a single home sleep apnea test is negative, inconclusive, or technically inadequate, polysomnography be performed for the diagnosis of OSA. (STRONG). We recommend that polysomnography, rather than home sleep apnea testing, be used for the diagnosis of OSA in patients with significant cardiorespiratory disease, potential respiratory muscle weakness due to neuromuscular condition, awake hypoventilation or suspicion of sleep related hypoventilation, chronic opioid medication use, history of stroke or severe insomnia. (STRONG). We suggest that, if clinically appropriate, a split-night diagnostic protocol, rather than a full-night diagnostic protocol for polysomnography be used for the diagnosis of OSA. (WEAK). We suggest that when the initial polysomnogram is negative and clinical suspicion for OSA remains, a second polysomnogram be considered for the diagnosis of OSA. (WEAK).

### Treatment of central sleep apnea in adults: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^55c097ef]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on central sleep apnea:

- **Definition**: CSA is a sleep disorder characterized by intermittent cessation or reduction of respiratory effort during sleep due to a lack of respiratory drive from the brain.
- **Pathophysiology**: CSA can be idiopathic or associated with underlying disorders such as HF, stroke, opioid use, ESRD, and high-altitude exposure. The pathophysiology of CSA involves unstable ventilatory control during sleep, leading to periods of insufficient ventilation and compromised gas exchange.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of CSA is estimated at 7.8% in males and 0.3% in females in the general population, and up to 25–40% in patients with HFrEF.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for CSA include male sex, older age, CVDs, stroke, and opioid use.
- **Disease course**: Clinically, CSA presents with symptoms such as frequent awakenings, nonrefreshing sleep, nocturnal dyspnea, snoring, difficulty staying asleep, and excessive daytime sleepiness. It can present with or without Cheyne-Stokes breathing.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of CSA can vary based on the underlying causes and associated comorbidities. However, with timely diagnosis and appropriate management, the QoL and clinical outcomes can be significantly improved.

### Sleep and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^0f25b3ff]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Sleep disorders are pervasive in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient with COPD is especially vulnerable to sleep-induced gas exchange aberrations. Most sleep disturbances affect the quality of life and some potentially affect survival in these patients. These issues impact treatment of these patients.

Recent Findings

Insomnia is very common in COPD but might respond to inhaled anticholinergic agents. The use of hypnotics in the hypercapnic patient with severe COPD might be dangerous. The incidence of sleep apnea in COPD patients is allegedly very high, but recent studies suggest this association to be artifactual. Nocturnal oxygen desaturation, which is common in these patients, occurs even in mild COPD. This clinical complication might reflect sleep-disordered breathing or REM sleep-related hypoventilation. We need cost-effective and reliable methods to help distinguish between these causes without routinely resorting to formal polysomnography.

Summary

Development of sound clinical algorithms to address this clinical dilemma is indeed a focus for future research. Some of these patients might require continuous positive pressure therapy, whereas others might need long-term oxygen therapy. Although oxygen therapy in COPD patients with only mild hypoxemia and nocturnal desaturation has not uniformly been shown to be beneficial, it is perhaps too soon to abandon this important clinical intervention in these patients.

This article reviews the terminology of obstructive sleep apnea and the associated diagnostic tests and provides an overview of the risk factors for this chronic condition. Sleep apnea affects 2% to 4% of middle-aged working adults in the general population, however, a considerable number of affected individuals remain undiagnosed. Patients with the disease may be at a higher risk for adverse perioperative outcomes. Knowledge of factors associated with an increased risk of obstructive sleep apnea is vital to the perioperative assessment and anesthetic plan.

### Mechanisms of apnea [^af794e86]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

This paper focuses on the underlying mechanisms contributing to sleep-disordered breathing. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is the most common sleep-related breathing disorder and is characterized by repetitive narrowing or collapse of the pharyngeal airway during sleep. Conversely, central sleep apnea (CSA), highly prevalent in congestive heart failure, is distinguished by a lack of drive to breathe during sleep, resulting in repetitive periods of insufficient ventilation. Both lead to compromised gas exchange, impaired sleep continuity, and catecholamine surges and are associated with major comorbidities including excessive daytime sleepiness and increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Although OSA and CSA exist on a spectrum of sleep-disordered breathing, the 2 entities may overlap in their underlying pathophysiologies. This brief review summarizes the etiology and current understanding of OSA and CSA pathophysiology and the role that the cardiovascular system may play in contributing to disease pathology and highlights the likely substantial overlap that exists between the various forms of sleep-disordered breathing.

### Anesthesia and sleep apnea [^f2025726]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Due to its low rate of diagnosis, in the general population over half of those experiencing obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) are unaware that they have the condition. However, any acute medical event may exacerbate OSA and could have serious health consequences. In this context the management of the perioperative period, from anesthesia through the surgery itself and into the postoperative period, is more problematic for patients with sleep disordered breathing than for others. There is prolific literature in this area although large randomized trials are few due to the high sample size needed and possible ethical difficulties of withholding OSA treatment in the perioperative period. In 2014 the American Society of Anesthesiologists published an updated set of recommendations to guide OSA management during the perioperative period. In this present review we provide an overview of the different issues that practitioners face with regard to OSA, from the initial consultation with the anesthesiologist to the extended post-operative period. There is considerable evidence that OSA patients are at high risk of perioperative complications, though the inherent risks from OSA per se and its comorbidities remain difficult to discern. Nevertheless, appropriate screening and management allow clinicians to minimize OSA associated risk.

### Breath of fresh air: toward unraveling the molecular underpinnings of sleep apnea [^ab98b033]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is an important risk factor for multiple diseases. A total of 425 million adults aged 30–69 are estimated to have severe OSA, including 65 million in the most affected country, China. Positive airway pressure, the primary treatment for OSA, has relatively low adherence, emphasizing a continued need for more personalized treatments. OSA and related quantitative traits including the apnea–hypopnea index (AHI) are heritable. Genome-wide association analyses (GWAS) are one means of identifying novel molecular processes underlying OSA and potential targets for future interventions in an unbiased manner. Performing OSA GWAS is difficult because of performing overnight polysomnography (PSG) in sample sizes suitably powered for genetic studies. A small but growing number of significant associations with OSA and related quantitative traits have been discovered in the last half-decade, largely on the basis of European- and admixed American-ancestry participants. To date, no strong associations have been identified in East Asians.

### My child cannot breathe while sleeping: a report of three cases and review [^85f7f964]. BMC Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

Here we described 3 cases of childhood nocturnal breath-holding episodes, each related to a different diagnosis. A major conclusion of this report is that the differential diagnosis for paroxysmal breath-holding spells during sleep should consider nocturnal seizures and sleep disorders, such as parasomnia, sleep-related laryngospasm associated with GERD, and obstructive sleep apnea.

Insufficient or lack of sleep is a common trigger factor for developing seizures and epileptiform discharges on EEG. Children with epilepsy commonly complain of sleep disturbances, including nighttime awakening, particularly when seizures are poorly controlled. Nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy and benign focal childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes are a few more common epileptic syndromes that present with nocturnal seizures.

Nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy is characterized by various motor behaviors during sleep, including pedaling movement of the limbs, dystonic posturing, and tremors after sudden arousal. Because the interictal EEGs are usually normal in cases with nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy, the differentiation of this disorder from partial arousal parasomnias or sleep-related movement disorders may be difficult when the nocturnal symptoms are nonspecific.

Benign focal childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes is characterized by partial seizures with sensorimotor symptoms of the face and oropharynx, hemiconvulsions, and tonic-clonic seizures during NREM sleep. Seizures usually occur on a nightly basis during sleep or upon awakening.

When nocturnal seizures are eliminated as a diagnostic possibility, the suggested differential diagnosis includes sleep-related choking syndrome or laryngospasm, which can be associated with GER during sleep. Although GER commonly occurs in infants and resolves with age, the persistence of nocturnal GERD is a known cause of sleep disturbances in children. Sleep-related choking syndrome or laryngospasm has been described in the diagnostic and coding manual of the American Sleep Disorder Association as a dramatic attack that produces breathing difficulties, awakening, stridor, apnea, fear, and agitation that typically resolves within 1–3 min. Reflux-induced apnea affects approximately 1% of infants and is related to airway closure or laryngospasm. Recently, GER studies have revealed that weak acid reflux during the nighttime occurs more frequently than was previously considered and may trigger nocturnal episodes of laryngospasm. The extreme reported cases of laryngospasm related to GERD include Sandifer syndrome, sleep-related laryngospasm, refractory asthma, and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Sandifer syndrome is often misdiagnosed as epilepsy and is characterized by the head rotation and tonic posture. Manifestations of this syndrome typically occur in the postprandial period.

### Association between physical activity patterns and symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea: a cross-sectional analysis of NHANES data [^ff0881ef]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a significant global public health concern, characterized by recurrent airway obstruction, intermittent hypoxia, and frequent awakenings during sleep. Common symptoms include daytime sleepiness, fatigue, loud snoring, and gasping for air, which collectively contribute to a reduced quality of life and increased health risks. OSA affects approximately 936 million people worldwide, with the highest prevalence observed in China, followed by the United States, Brazil, and India. The prevalence of mild OSA in adults ranges from 9 to 38%, with severe cases affecting 6% to 17% of adults and up to 36% of older populations. OSA is often comorbid with obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes, significantly increasing mortality and healthcare costs.

While OSA is clinically diagnosed through polysomnography, large-scale epidemiological studies often rely on self-reported symptoms to assess the prevalence of sleep-disordered breathing and its associated factors. These symptoms, referred to as OSA symptoms, encompass excessive daytime sleepiness, loud snoring, and gasping during sleep. Although less precise than clinical diagnoses, self-reported OSA symptoms provide a practical and cost-effective way to explore population-level trends and identify modifiable risk factors.

The impact of physical activity (PA) and other lifestyle factors on sleep health is increasingly recognized. PA enhances cardiovascular health, muscle strength, and overall endurance, all crucial for managing the physical demands and fatigue associated with sleep disorders. It has also been shown to positively influence immune function and recovery, further supporting its role in sleep health. Adequate PA not only helps improve sleep quality but also mitigates the risk of complications arising from poor sleep.

Despite the World Health Organization's recommendation that adults engage in at least 150 to 300 min of moderate-intensity or 75–150 min of vigorous-intensity PA weekly, the fast pace of modern life makes it challenging for many to adhere to these guidelines consistently. As a result, some individuals opt to concentrate their exercise into fewer, longer sessions over the weekend, adopting the "Weekend Warrior" (WW) pattern. Although this pattern involves fewer weekly exercise sessions, each session is prolonged, leading to significant energy expenditure.

### Understanding the impact of symptoms on the burden of COPD [^994fb8be]. Respiratory Research (2017). Low credibility.

Impact of COPD symptoms on sleep

Sleep disturbances are common among patients with COPD, affecting in excess of 70% of patients. Sleep disturbances include difficulties in initiating and maintaining sleep and increased number of arousals during the night, and arise from a combination of disturbances in ventilation and gas exchange caused by the underlying condition and disruption caused by nighttime respiratory symptoms (particularly coughing, breathlessness, and sputum production) and other generalized symptoms such as chest pain, heartburn/palpitations, and nighttime fear and anxiety. As previously noted, sleep quality is a major determinant of health-related quality of life in patients with COPD, and sleep disturbances are associated with poor health outcomes. Sleep-related breathing disturbances in patients with COPD result in hypoxemia and hypercapnia, which are associated with cardiac arrhythmias, pulmonary hypertension, and nocturnal death, especially during acute exacerbations. Disturbed sleep leads to difficulties in getting up in the morning and is associated with depressive and anxiety symptoms. Sleep disturbances have been shown to be greater in patients with worse dyspnea upon exertion and are also associated with reduced subsequent daytime physical activity. In a European retrospective analysis of real-world data describing 2807 patients with COPD, 78% of patients experienced physician-reported nighttime disturbances due to symptoms including 'trouble falling asleep', 'wake up several times per night', 'trouble staying asleep', and 'wake up feeling tired and worn-out after usual amount of sleep'. The researchers identified a higher incidence of daytime breathlessness and more frequent exacerbations within the previous 12 months in patients who experienced COPD nighttime symptoms than in those who had no nighttime symptoms. Furthermore, the presence of nighttime symptoms was associated with a greater likelihood of experiencing COPD morning symptoms, disturbed sleep, and poorer quality of life. These findings were consistent with other reports that nighttime symptoms impair sleep quality and morning routine, which combine to compromise overall health status. In ASSESS, the presence of ≥ 1 COPD symptom in any part of the day was associated with significantly worse sleep quality, and moreover patients with morning, daytime, or nighttime symptoms had significantly higher COPD and Asthma Sleep Impact Scale scores versus those without symptoms, indicating that these patients have greater sleep impairment. A population-based, longitudinal study of 98 adults with COPD found that respiratory symptoms such as cough and breathlessness may be responsible for poor sleep quality; however, sleep disturbance was predictive of COPD exacerbations (odds ratio [OR] 4.7; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3, 17; p = 0.018), respiratory-related emergency healthcare utilization (OR 11.5; 95% CI 2.1, 62; p = 0.004), and all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 5.0; 95% CI 1.4, 18; p = 0.013), suggesting that sleep plays an independent role as a risk factor for worsening COPD and poor outcomes. These cross-sectional and longitudinal associations are illustrated in Fig. 2.

### What is "abnormal" in pediatric sleep? [^704526f4]. Respiratory Care (2010). Low credibility.

Sleep-disordered breathing in general and, more particularly, the obstructive sleep apnea syndrome are highly prevalent conditions in children. Although the diagnosis appears relatively straightforward using a sleep study (polysomnography), this labor-intensive and expensive procedure is used in only a minority of cases across the country because of the relative unavailability of pediatric sleep centers. However, the definition of an abnormal sleep study is not a trivial process and requires a methodical delineation of normative data, implication of "abnormal" variables to specific outcomes, and demonstration of cost-effectiveness of such approach. Unfortunately, such studies are lacking; there is no real consensus on any of these important aspects, which in turn leads to delays in diagnosis and treatment. Such paucity of validated data, however, is an opportunity to explore alternative options that would enable incorporation of biomarkers into well defined and validated algorithms. There is no doubt that novel approaches to the evaluation of community-based and clinically referred pediatric populations should enable more pragmatic and reliable diagnostic approaches for pediatric sleep-disordered breathing.

### STOP-bang questionnaire: a practical approach to screen for obstructive sleep apnea [^02bcfa2d]. Chest (2016). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "STOP-BANG score for obstructive sleep apnea" for obstructive sleep apnea.

The STOP-BANG score is a clinical calculator used to assess the risk of Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) in patients. The acronym stands for Snoring, Tiredness, Observed apnea, high blood Pressure, Body mass index (BMI), Age, Neck circumference, and Gender, which are the eight factors considered in the score.

This calculator is applicable to the general adult population, particularly those who present with symptoms of sleep apnea such as excessive daytime sleepiness, loud snoring, observed episodes of breathing cessation during sleep, and abrupt awakenings accompanied by gasping or choking.

The clinical utility of the STOP-BANG score is to identify individuals at high risk for OSA who may benefit from further diagnostic evaluation, such as polysomnography. It is a simple and effective tool that can be used in both primary care and preoperative settings to screen for OSA.

There are no specific exclusion criteria for the use of the STOP-BANG score. However, it may not be as effective in populations with a low prevalence of OSA or in patients with other sleep disorders.

The STOP-BANG score for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is calculated using responses to eight questions addressing symptoms and risk factors associated with OSA. Each response is given a score of either 0 or 1, based on a predefined scoring system. The sum of these scores determines the individual's risk level for OSA.

The questions relate to:

1. **Loud snoring**: "Yes" = 1, "No" = 0
2. **Daytime tiredness**: "Yes" = 1, "No" = 0
3. **Observed apneas**: "Yes" = 1, "No" = 0
4. **High blood pressure**: "Yes" = 1, "No" = 0
5. **Body mass index (BMI)**: " > 35 kg/m²" = 1, " ≤ 35 kg/m²" = 0
6. **Age**: " > 50 years" = 1, " ≤ 50 years" = 0
7. **Neck circumference**: " > 40 cm" = 1, " ≤ 40 cm" = 0
8. **Gender**: "Male" = 1, "Female" = 0

The STOP-BANG score is computed by summing the individual scores for each question. The interpretation of the total score is as follows: a score of less than 3 indicates a low risk of OSA, while a score of 3 or higher indicates a high risk of OSA. The scoring system provides a straightforward method for initial screening of individuals at risk for obstructive sleep apnea.

### Controversies in monitoring and testing for sleep-disordered breathing [^f09eb71e]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Despite significant advances in the understanding of the pathophysiology of the obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, the best index to classify the severity of sleep-disordered breathing has not been established. The use of new measurement techniques suggests that subtle changes in airflow not detected by conventional thermal sensing devices may signal events associated with significant sleep disruption. Recurrent increased respiratory efforts without discernable changes in airflow, which are currently reliably detectable only by invasive means, also may be important. However, it is still uncertain which events should be considered clinically significant, and the correlation of the frequency of various types of respiratory events with long term physiologic consequences is not clear. Outpatient screening with multichannel portable devices or pulse oximetry has important limitations. However, in combination with the clinical pretest probability of significant sleep-disordered breathing, such screening may correctly classify a large proportion of patients. Combining a partial night diagnostic sleep study with a therapeutic titration of continuous positive airway pressure seems to provide adequate information for appropriate management of many patients with obstructive sleep apnea and reduces time between presentation and initiation of treatment.

### The prevalence of central sleep apnea in new referrals to a sleep surgery clinic [^1fda65e9]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a complex sleep disorder characterized by upper airway collapse despite respiratory effort, leading to drops in oxygen levels or arousals. Untreated OSA has been associated with an increased risk of both cardiovascular and neurocognitive comorbidities and mortality. The gold standard treatment option for OSA has historically been positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy; however, many patients struggle to tolerate or adhere to using PAP adequately and turn to alternative therapies. Patients often will be referred to a "PAP Alternative Clinic" or a "Sleep Surgery Clinic" to learn about and pursue other treatment options, including mandibular advancement devices or oral appliance therapy, positional therapy, and upper airway surgery (including upper airway stimulation, pharyngeal surgery, and skeletal surgery). Interest in sleep surgery has increased over the years due to enhanced awareness of alternatives through marketing and research, newer techniques and additional treatment options, notably hypoglossal nerve stimulation therapy.

Although OSA is the most common type of sleep apnea, other types, including central sleep apnea (CSA), exist. CSA has a considerably lower prevalence than OSA, accounting for around 5% to 10% of sleep medicine clinic patientsand 1% of diagnoses on polysomnography.CSA, however, is far more prevalent in patients with heart failure, occurring in 30% to 40% of this population.CSA patient presentation can be similar to that of an OSA patient, with complaints of gasping, intermittent snoring, sleep fragmentation, sleepiness, and cardiovascular history. There are many types of CSA including Cheyne‐Stokes, altitude‐induced, opioid‐induced, primary/idiopathic, treatment‐emergent, and other variants (neurologic related, transitional, postarousal events, congenital central hypoventilation syndrome, and more). It has also been shown to be more common in patients who are male, > 65 years old, with a lower body mass index (BMI) and with lower Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) scores. It is important to differentiate between central and obstructive sleep apnea, as treatment options are significantly different. Patients with CSA do not respond to OSA surgical interventions but instead can be treated with certain PAP therapies like an Adaptive‐Servo‐Ventilation (machine, oxygen, medications like acetazolamide or theophylline, or the Remedē device (ZOLL Respicardia Inc).

### Clinical guideline for the evaluation, management and long-term care of obstructive sleep apnea in adults [^86ae918d]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2009). Medium credibility.

Testing with portable monitors (PM) for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) should be performed only with a comprehensive sleep evaluation and supervision by a practitioner with board certification in sleep medicine or an individual meeting eligibility criteria (Consensus). At a minimum, a PM should record airflow, respiratory effort, and blood oxygenation, using biosensors recommended for in-laboratory PSG (oronasal thermal sensor for apneas, nasal pressure transducer for hypopneas, oximetry, and ideally calibrated or uncalibrated inductance plethysmography) (Consensus), with trained personnel available for sensor application or patient instruction (Consensus). PMs may be used unattended as an alternative to PSG in patients with a high pretest probability of moderate to severe OSA and without comorbid sleep or major medical disorders when these parameters are met (Consensus). Diagnosis and severity should use the same criteria as PSG with scoring consistent with AASM standards (Consensus). RDI for PMs is defined differently — RDI PM is the number of apneas + hypopneas / total recording time rather than total sleep time — and PMs are likely to underestimate severity compared to AHI by PSG; due to false negatives, in-laboratory PSG should be performed when PM is technically inadequate or fails to establish the diagnosis in high pretest probability cases (Consensus).

### Obstructive sleep apnea [^35b5773f]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is very common but is frequently undiagnosed. Symptoms include loud snoring, nocturnal awakening, and daytime sleepiness. Motor vehicle accidents due to drowsy driving are a particular concern. Evaluation and treatment should focus on symptomatic patients, both to alleviate symptoms and to potentially decrease cardiovascular risk. In recent years, a strategy of home sleep apnea testing followed by initiation of autotitrating continuous positive airway pressure therapy in the home has greatly reduced barriers to diagnosis and treatment and has also facilitated routine management of OSA by primary care providers.

### Identifying cases of undiagnosed, clinically significant COPD in primary care: qualitative insight from patients in the target population [^a05d74da]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Results

Eight focus groups (n = 44) and six one-on-one telephone interviews (n = 6) were conducted. Sample characteristics are summarised in Tables 2 and 3. For the COPD patients, mean post-bronchodilator FEV₁ was 68% predicted (s.d. = 10) (mean FEV₁ = 2.2 l (s.d. = 0.8)), and time since diagnosis averaged three months.

Spirometric values for three cases in the non-COPD groups suggested possible airway obstruction; these participants were referred to their physician for follow-up. In two cases, spirometry was performed after their focus groups. The third case was uncovered after screening and enrolment, and the decision was made to have him participate in the originally assigned no-COPD group so that he could share his experiences in an environment of people without COPD experience. Data from these three cases were also examined separately, comparing their responses with others.

Six major themes were identified in the data: (1) exposure to smoke and other pollutants (e.g. chemicals, paint, gasoline), either through a friend/relative, work environment or living condition; (2) personal and family history of respiratory health conditions, such as emphysema, pneumonia, frequent colds and sinus infections; (3) recent history of respiratory events, including factors that may trigger an event (perfumes, cigarette smoke, exertion) and recent clinic visits or hospitalisations owing to respiratory symptoms such as shortness of breath, coughing and chest tightness that continued to worsen; (4) symptoms, including respiratory (e.g. shortness of breath with and without exertion, sputum and phlegm production, wheezing, chest tightness and congestion) and nonrespiratory (e.g. feeling tired after slight exertion, low energy, sleeping problems such as waking up at night feeling short of breath); (5) impact of breathing-related problems on daily life (e.g. slowing down or stopping owing to breathlessness, unable to complete daily chores, unable to keep up with others); and (6) the attribution of symptoms or experiences (e.g. breathless, being tired or slowing down attributed to age or weight; cough attributed to smoking or smoke exposure).

Patient's perspective

'I felt very much out of breath, as if something strangled me, and the first few days it only got worse. The coughing was also very hard to bear, as I was gasping for air after every coughing fit. After the course of antibiotics, I felt much better and the cough and feeling of suffocation were completely gone. Now, a year later, I still struggle with a raspy voice after the cortisone-induced thrush, but I lost 30 kg body weight a few weeks later, am working again and none of the symptoms returned'.
Learning points

Vaccinated people may present with atypical symptoms of Bordetella pertussis infection, including angioedema.
If a patient presents with angioedema, dangerous and common causes should be ruled out first, but uncommon causes such as B. pertussis infection should be considered.
Pertussis toxin may be responsible for increased vascular permeability causing angioedema.
Vaccination is most important for the prevention of pertussis transmission, especially in children < 1 year who have the highest risk of mortality.

2.3. Question: What Is the Clinical Value of Performing Additional Preoperative Tests?

Recommendation 2.3.1: There Is Insufficient Evidence to Support Canceling or Delaying Surgery to Perform More Advanced Screening Techniques or Sleep Testing to Diagnose OSA in Those Patients Identified as Being at High Risk of OSA Preoperatively, Unless There Is Evidence of an Associated Significant or Uncontrolled Systemic Disease or Additional Problems With Ventilation or Gas Exchange (Level of Evidence: Low. Grade of Recommendation: Weak for)

Because screening instruments perform better in patients with greater OSA severity, screen-positive patients with greater threshold values should be assumed to have moderate-to-severe OSA in the absence of diagnostic polysomnography. The inclusion of preoperative serum bicarbonate level may improve the predictive accuracy of the screening instrument. Although AHI is the most commonly used metric of OSA severity, other parameters such as oxygen desaturation index, or cumulated duration of oxygen desaturation < 90% may improve prediction of postoperative complications. Further research in this area will help to better define which patients with diagnosed or suspected OSA are at most risk of postoperative complications.

Table 7.
Summary of Recommendations for Screening to Identify Patients With Suspected OSA

The aforementioned recommendation does not relate to procedures in which polysomnography is performed as part of the accepted preoperative management, usually because of a high prevalence of OSA (eg, bariatric surgery, tonsillectomy, or upper airway surgery for OSA). Summaries of the different recommendations for screening of surgical patients for OSA are listed in Table 7.

Included studies in the evidence review used minimum diagnostic cutoffs "ranging from 5 to 20 events per hour".

HOME SLEEP APNOEA TESTING

Following the high prevalence, for clinical purposes, recording devices for sleep disordered breathing were reduced to the essentials. The agreed essentials are airflow, respiratory effort, oxygen saturation, HR (or ECG or pulse rate), body position, some surrogate for sleep time (could be just self reported), sometimes snoring. Devices based on these six channels/signals had been validated against the gold standard PSG and have proven to deliver accurate diagnoses when compared between centres. Criteria for their accuracy had been documented and are considered for out-of-centre type of recording sleep apnoea. Devices are approved to be good enough to distinguish obstructive, mixed, central apnoea events, and hypopnoea events. Recommendations and guidelines had been published for general medical care. Limitations for applying home sleep apnoea testing devices (also called polygraphy) had been specified and noted. These are comorbidities like cardiovascular disorders, neurological disorders, other sleep disorders, and more complex sleep disordered breathing such as nocturnal hypoventilation, which require CO₂ recording.

Recommendation 3.2.6: Patients Should Be Encouraged to Wear Their PAP Device at Appropriate Times During Their Stay in the Hospital, Both Preoperatively and Postoperatively (Level of Evidence: Moderate. Grade of Recommendation: Strong for):

As noted earlier, accumulating evidence suggests that PAP therapy for OSA patients may play a role in reducing postoperative complications.– We recommend patients be encouraged to use their PAP therapy at their previously prescribed setting during sleep while in the hospital. Simple maneuvers such as refitting a mask, the addition of heated humidification, or the control of nasal congestion with nasal corticosteroid sprays may help patients to adhere to therapy, and consideration should be given to inquiring about these issues in poorly adherent patients. Consultation with the patient's sleep specialist may be considered if there are additional questions regarding optimizing PAP usage in the postoperative care setting.

3.3. Question: What Are the Best Preoperative Practices Aimed at Improving Outcomes for Surgical Patients Who Have a High Probability for OSA?

Recommendation 3.3.1: The Patient, Surgeon, Anesthesiologist, and the Health Care Team Should Be Aware Before the Procedure That the Patient Has a High Probability of Having OSA, Which May Increase the Morbidity Associated With Surgery (Level of Evidence: Low. Grade of Recommendation: Strong for)

The consensus of the SASM Task Force is that all perioperative providers, as well as the patient, should be aware that the patient has a high probability of having OSA, and this could potentially adversely affect their clinical course. – Identifying these patients preoperatively will allow for the implementation of specific practices and protocols aimed at minimizing perioperative risk.–

Recommendation 3.3.2: We Suggest That Additional Evaluation for Preoperative Cardiopulmonary Optimization Be Considered in Patients Who Have a High Probability of Having OSA and Where There Is Indication of Uncontrolled Systemic Conditions or Additional Problems With Ventilation or Gas Exchange. These Conditions Include, but May Not Be Limited to (i) Hypoventilation Syndromes, (ii) Severe Pulmonary Hypertension, and (iii) Resting Hypoxemia Not Attributable to Other Cardiopulmonary Disease (Level of Evidence: Low. Grade of Recommendation: Weak for)

The Task Force recognizes that there is a paucity of data to support delaying surgery for patients with a high probability of having OSA. However, as noted in 3.2.3, patients with certain comorbidities, such as clinically significant hypoventilationor pulmonary hypertension, may be more likely to develop postoperative complications, and these conditions commonly coexist with OSA. Unexplained preoperative hypoxemia should also warrant consideration for further preoperative evaluation.

Symptoms and clinical findings in OSA

In patients with OSA, extremely loud snoring and sleep apnea are typical symptoms, often prompting visits based on the partner's observations (Table 1). However, the rational clinical examination systematic review by Myers, et al. reported that the most useful observation for identifying patients with OSA was nocturnal choking or gasping (summary likelihood ratio [LR], 3.3; 95% CI, 2.1–4.6) when the diagnosis was established by apnea-hypopnea index: AHI ≥ 10/h). Snoring is common in OSA patients but is not useful for establishing the diagnosis (summary LR, 1.1; 95% CI, 1.0–1.1). Daytime excessive sleepiness is a common subjective clinical symptom, although it has been reported that awareness of symptoms is often lacking, particularly among patients with cardiovascular diseases. As there is controversy regarding the association of morning headache and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS), Goksan, et al. demonstrated that prevalence of morning headache increases with increasing OSAS severity. Atrial stretch due to the large negative pressure swings by OSA results in secretion of atrial natriuretic peptide, causing nocturia. The prevalence of OSA increases with factors such as obesity and aging, but in Asia, there are many non-obese OSA patients related to craniofacial bony restriction.

Table 1
Symptoms and clinical finding of OSA

Therefore, when examining hypertensive patients, it is important to pay attention to typical symptoms such as sleepiness and abnormalities in facial and pharyngeal morphology, even in non-obese patients, and to actively perform OSA screening tests when these abnormalities are suspected. Additionally, it is necessary to actively suspect OSA in patients with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), aortic disease, atrial fibrillation (AF), and those undergoing dialysis.

### The intestinal gas questionnaire: development of a new instrument for measuring gas-related symptoms and their impact on daily life [^90bce08c]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Although gas-related symptoms (GRS) are common and intrusive, there are no questionnaires to quantitate this problem. This study aimed to develop an instrument to rectify this gap in our knowledge.

Methods

Concepts were initially identified from the literature and interviews with gastroenterologists. Exploratory one-to-one interviews and focus groups with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients (n = 28) and non-IBS subjects (n = 27) with GRS were conducted in UK, France, and Spain leading to a conceptual framework for the questionnaire. Last, iterative rounds of cognitive debriefing were performed with IBS (n = 16) and non-IBS subjects (n = 14).

Key Results

From the first three steps, nine GRS (bloating, distension, flatulence, odorous flatulence, difficult gas evacuation, stomach rumbling, belching, bad breath, and abdominal movement) were identified although abdominal movement was subsequently excluded. Twelve quality of life domains affected by these symptoms were identified as: Clothing, emotional, physical appearance, diet, daily living, work, social life, physical activity, relationships, sex life, sleep, and cognitive function. A 24-h recall for symptoms and a 7-day recall for impact assessment were supported by the qualitative findings. Cognitive debriefing confirmed the understanding of the instrument. Across the three languages, the instrument was conceptually and linguistically consistent.

Conclusions & Inferences

The International Gas Questionnaire is a 2-part instrument, developed rigorously and simultaneously in three languages assessing seven symptoms (17 items) and their impact on 12 domains (26 items) in IBS and general population. It is now undergoing psychometric validation and should provide a unique tool for epidemiological surveys and clinical trials for developing new treatments for these symptoms.

### Clinical diagnosis and misdiagnosis of sleep disorders [^393996a1]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2007). Low credibility.

Sleep disorders are common in all sections of the population and are either the main clinical complaint or a frequent complication of many conditions for which patients are seen in primary care or specialist services. However, the subject is poorly covered in medical education. A major consequence is that the manifestations of the many sleep disorders now identified are likely to be misinterpreted as other clinical conditions of a physical or psychological nature, especially neurological or psychiatric disorders. To illustrate this problem, examples are provided of the various possible causes of sleep loss, poor quality sleep, excessive daytime sleepiness and episodes of disturbed behaviour at night (parasomnias). All of these sleep disorders can adversely affect mental state and behaviour, daytime performance or physical health, the true cause of which needs to be recognised by clinicians to ensure that appropriate treatment is provided. As conventional history taking in neurology and psychiatry pays little attention to sleep and its possible disorders, suggestions are made concerning the enquiries that could be included in history taking schedules to increase the likelihood that sleep disorders will be correctly identified.

### Evaluation and management of dyspnea as the dominant presenting feature in neuromuscular disorders [^a6b4bafa]. Muscle & Nerve (2024). Medium credibility.

Dyspnea is a common symptom in neuromuscular disorders and, although multifactorial, it is usually due to respiratory muscle involvement, associated musculoskeletal changes such as scoliosis or, in certain neuromuscular conditions, cardiomyopathy. Clinical history can elicit symptoms such as orthopnea, trepopnea, sleep disruption, dysphagia, weak cough, and difficulty with secretion clearance. The examination is essential to assist with the diagnosis of an underlying neurologic disorder and determine whether dyspnea is from a cardiac or pulmonary origin. Specific attention should be given to possible muscle loss, use of accessory muscles of breathing, difficulty with neck flexion/extension, presence of thoraco-abdominal paradox, conversational dyspnea, cardiac examination, and should include a detailed neurological examination directed at the suspected differential diagnosis. Pulmonary function testing including sitting and supine spirometry, measures of inspiratory and expiratory muscle strength, cough peak flow, sniff nasal inspiratory pressure, pulse oximetry, transcutaneous CO₂, and arterial blood gases will help determine the extent of the respiratory muscle involvement, assess for hypercapnic or hypoxemic respiratory failure, and qualify the patient for noninvasive ventilation when appropriate. Additional testing includes dynamic imaging with sniff fluoroscopy or diaphragm ultrasound, and diaphragm electromyography. Polysomnography is indicated for sleep related symptoms that are not otherwise explained. Noninvasive ventilation alleviates dyspnea and nocturnal symptoms, improves quality of life, and prolongs survival. Therapy targeted at neuromuscular disorders may help control the disease or favorably modify its course. For patients who have difficulty with secretion clearance, support of expiratory function with mechanical insufflation-exsufflation, oscillatory devices can reduce the aspiration risk.

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

ACC/AHA 2005 heart failure — sleep-disordered breathing and respiratory support — Patients with HF frequently exhibit abnormal respiratory patterns including Cheyne-Stokes breathing and sleep-disordered breathing, and in the Sleep Heart Health Study sleep-disordered breathing was associated with a 2.38 relative risk of HF independent of other known risk factors. The use of nocturnal oxygen and devices that provide continuous positive airway pressure has been reported to produce symptomatic improvement, and treatment of established left ventricular (LV) dysfunction with continuous positive airway pressure has been shown to improve LV structure and function in patients with either obstructive or central sleep apnea disturbed-breathing syndrome. Additional studies are in progress to evaluate efficacy and safety and to help identify patients most likely to benefit.

### Sleep-disordered breathing in neuromuscular disease [^8588e2ad]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Sleep-disordered breathing in neuromuscular diseases is due to an exaggerated reduction in lung volumes during supine sleep, a compromised physiologic adaptation to sleep, and specific features of the diseases that may promote upper airway collapse or heart failure. The normal decrease in the rib cage contribution to the tidal volume during phasic REM sleep becomes a critical vulnerability, resulting in saw-tooth oxygen desaturation possibly representing the earliest manifestation of respiratory muscle weakness. Hypoventilation can occur in REM sleep and progress into non-REM sleep, with continuous desaturation and hypercarbia. Specific characteristics of neuromuscular disorders, such as pharyngeal neuropathy or weakness, macroglossia, bulbar manifestations, or low lung volumes, predispose patients to the development of obstructive events. Central sleep-disordered breathing can occur with associated cardiomyopathy (e.g., dystrophies) or from instability in the control of breathing due to diaphragm weakness. Mitigating factors such as recruitment of accessory respiratory muscles, reduction in REM sleep, and loss of normal REM atonia in some individuals may partially protect against sleep-disordered breathing. Noninvasive ventilation, a standard-of-care management option for sleep-disordered breathing, can itself trigger specific sleep-disordered breathing events including air leaks, patient-ventilator asynchrony, central sleep apnea, and glottic closure. These events increase arousals, reduce adherence, and impair sleep architecture. Polysomnography plays an important role in addressing pitfalls in the diagnosis of sleep-disordered breathing in neuromuscular diseases, identifying sleep-disordered breathing triggered by noninvasive ventilation, and optimizing noninvasive ventilation settings.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for obstructive sleep apnea, more specifically with respect to initial sleep study, AASM 2017 guidelines recommend to obtain either polysomnography or home sleep apnea testing as the first-line investigation for patients with suspected OSA, in the absence of conditions that warrant using polysomnography as a first-line test.

### My child cannot breathe while sleeping: a report of three cases and review [^9a263510]. BMC Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, breath-holding episodes during sleep should be differentiated from nocturnal seizures and other sleep disorders. When diagnosing nocturnal episodes, it is important to take into consideration the fact that sleep-related choking syndrome and laryngospasm associated with GER may appear in the absence of other GERD symptoms. PSG is an essential tool for the evaluation of sleep abnormalities; however, PSG alone is not useful for the differentiation of nocturnal seizures and other sleep disorders in children. Therefore, PSG with full-montage video-EEG and simultaneous 24-h pH monitoring are important adjunct tools for the diagnosis of respiratory symptoms, such as breath spells, choking, and sudden coughing during sleep.

Regarding specific circumstances for obstructive sleep apnea, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients (questionnaires), BTS 2023 guidelines recommend to consider using the SRBD-PSQ (with a cut-off of ≥ 0.33) or the OSA-18 questionnaire (with a cut-off of ≥ 0.60) for diagnosing moderate-to-severe sleep-disordered breathing in ≥ 2 years old pediatric patients with no comorbidities. Obtain further tests, such as pulse oximetry, cardiorespiratory sleep studies, or polysomnography, if a test questionnaire is inconsistent with clinical features or if a higher degree of diagnostic certainty is required.

### Research priorities for translating endophenotyping of adult obstructive sleep apnea to the clinic: an official American Thoracic Society research statement [^00f9bcee]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Research priority 11: Assess the potential clinical and financial benefits and pitfalls of endophenotype-informed treatment selection with comparative effectiveness research

The highly controlled, "optimal" conditions in research trials are not necessarily reflective of real-world clinical settings. Nor is it known to what extent use of endophenotypes will meaningfully change clinician preferences and behaviors. Assuming that high-quality prospective validation studies are reported, they will attest to the potential benefits of endophenotype-informed care under optimal conditions ("efficacy"). However, the performance of endophenotyping in actual clinical settings ("effectiveness") remains to be established by comparative effectiveness research (CER), defined by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services as "research comparing the benefits and harms of different interventions and strategies to prevent, diagnose, treat and monitor health conditions in 'real world' settings". A previous ATS research statement provided guidance on the use of CER in pulmonary, critical care, and sleep medicine. Ultimately, CER studies that address the clinical and cost-effectiveness of care using OSA endophenotype-informed approaches versus usual care in specific scenarios are needed for translation. The rising prominence of home sleep testing evokes pertinent examples: emerging evidence suggests that PUP-estimated endotypes can be derived from home sleep tests and have the potential to influence treatment. However, PUP requires a nasal cannula airflow signal, which is not included in many current and emerging home sleep testing devices, such as "wearable" wrist and/or finger sensors, as well as devices that do not come into contact with patients (bed-based "nearables" and audio- or video-based "airables"). A practicing sleep clinician who routinely tests for OSA using such a device would need to balance the potential utility of PUP-estimated endotypes against the cost of deviating from usual practice for a test that includes a nasal cannula. Broadly, the large burden of undiagnosed OSA and the trend toward testing with devices that use limited and/or varying signals suggest a "tiered endophenotyping approach" may be necessary for metrics that require more extensive and costly data (e.g. in-laboratory polysomnography, drug-induced sleep endoscopy). That is, endophenotyping may be best reserved (initially) for certain subsets of patients (e.g. those who fail to respond to or decline the standard treatment approach with CPAP, patients considering surgical therapies) rather than applying such an approach to all patients with newly diagnosed OSA. In general, the costs and benefits of endophenotyping are expected to change with evolving practice paradigms, and CER is needed to help clinicians balance advantages and drawbacks.

### Arousal-based scoring of obstructive hypopneas [^a8e37fe0]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Obstructive sleep apnea in adults is diagnosed by an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) above five (at least five apneas and/or hypopneas per hour of sleep). Though the definition of apneas has remained stable, the scoring criteria for hypopneas has varied throughout the years. There is even more evidence now that scoring respiratory events associated with arousals should be included in the diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea, as these patients may benefit from treatment.

Recent Findings

Recent studies, trials and meta-analyses have demonstrated that respiratory events associated with arousal are associated with symptoms, such as poor sleep quality and excessive daytime sleepiness. These arousal-based hypopneas have also been noted to carry a risk of hypertension and other adverse health consequences.

Summary

Requiring a 4% oxygen desaturation for hypopneas may miss patients that may benefit from treatment for obstructive sleep apnea. These patients are typically younger, nonobese, and women as they have been found to have respiratory events causing sleep fragmentation versus significant oxygen desaturation as compared with other populations.
