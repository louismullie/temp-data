## Question

vasomotor rhinitis treatment

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to treat and manage vasomotor rhinitis (now termed nonallergic rhinopathy). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and excluding mimics. Then, I should assess severity and phenotype to guide therapy. Next, I will outline first-line pharmacologic options and dosing. After that, I need to consider escalation strategies, including combination therapy and decongestants. I will then review second-line and procedural options for refractory disease. Finally, I should address special populations, monitoring, and a practical algorithm, while double-checking areas where evidence is limited or conflicting.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic frame and exclusions, because vasomotor rhinitis is a diagnosis of exclusion and misclassification leads to suboptimal treatment. I need to ensure there is no allergic rhinitis with negative skin testing or serum IgE, no infectious rhinitis, no structural causes like septal deviation or nasal polyps, and no drug-induced rhinitis such as rhinitis medicamentosa from topical decongestants or medication effects from ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, or others; a careful history and exam, plus medication review, are essential before labeling this as nonallergic rhinopathy [^115TpQjE] [^1159xiqe] [^1123NiKx] [^1172H5kQ].

> Wait, let me verify the pathophysiology I'm invoking, because it shapes therapy. Nonallergic rhinopathy is largely neurogenic, with autonomic imbalance and TRPV1-mediated hyperreactivity to temperature, humidity, irritants, odors, and exercise; this mechanistic anchor explains why anticholinergics and neuro-modulatory approaches can help, and why anti-allergic strategies may be less effective when inflammation is minimal [^117FnCGe] [^111wvd7v].

> Next, I should review severity assessment and phenotype, since guidelines recommend using validated instruments and a stepwise approach. I will now examine symptom severity with a VAS and classify as mild versus moderate/severe, and I will phenotype by predominant symptom — rhinorrhea, congestion, or mixed — because this directs whether I prioritize anticholinergic therapy, intranasal corticosteroids, or combination approaches [^114WLdXq] [^1162pZty] [^113TBBCi].

> For first-line therapy, I need to check the strength of evidence for intranasal antihistamines and intranasal corticosteroids. Guidelines suggest either intranasal antihistamine (azelastine) or intranasal corticosteroid as acceptable first-line options, with azelastine favored for rapid onset and broad symptom coverage in nonallergic rhinopathy; azelastine is FDA-approved for vasomotor rhinitis in patients 12 years and older, with typical dosing of 2 sprays per nostril twice daily, and onset within hours, which is clinically useful [^111SsWCb] [^113XEfQb] [^115EDaxU] [^116XyKxu] [^115XtaBa].

> Hold on, I should verify the evidence base for intranasal corticosteroids in nonallergic rhinitis, because efficacy is more variable than in allergic rhinitis. Cochrane suggests modest short-term benefit at up to 4 weeks, with low to very low certainty beyond that and a higher risk of epistaxis; thus, INCS are reasonable for congestion-predominant disease or when combined with intranasal antihistamine, but I should counsel on epistaxis risk and reassess early [^115rfotL] [^115krV4A].

> Let me consider symptom-targeted add-on therapy. If rhinorrhea predominates, intranasal ipratropium is logical given cholinergic hyperactivity; guidelines support ipratropium as add-on to INCS when rhinorrhea persists, and it is particularly helpful in older adults with clear secretory symptoms and in patients with autonomic imbalance after trauma or neurogenic triggers [^115NAqYc] [^114MqzcU] [^111wk9rN] [^114tLUG8].

> I should double-check decongestant use, because rebound is a real risk. For severe mucosal edema impairing delivery of other agents, short courses of topical oxymetazoline up to 5 days can be considered; historically, I was taught to limit to 3 days, but a randomized study in vasomotor rhinitis showed no rebound after 10 days with benzalkonium-containing oxymetazoline, which cautiously supports extending to 4–5 days in select cases with close follow-up, while still avoiding prolonged use to prevent rhinitis medicamentosa [^1156aUdA] [^113GgMvg] [^115s5uzM].

> For moderate to severe disease unresponsive to monotherapy, I need to ensure escalation to combination therapy. The guideline suggests INCS plus intranasal antihistamine for persistent symptoms, and the fixed-dose azelastine/fluticasone combination has supportive long-term safety data; I should confirm dosing and counsel on taste and epistaxis risks, and set expectations for reassessment at 10–14 days [^111EDF8z] [^115uw7zT] [^115JLXq5] [^1162pZty].

> But wait, what if symptoms remain refractory despite optimized medical therapy? I should review procedural options. Posterior nasal nerve ablation by cryotherapy or laser can reduce neurogenic hyperreactivity, with multicenter data showing high rates of clinically meaningful improvement at 6 months; botulinum toxin injection to the turbinates has small studies suggesting benefit, and inferior turbinate reduction by radiofrequency or submucosal techniques can improve airflow in selected patients, though I must individualize based on anatomy and comorbidities [^114QhXAB] [^115kPDbM] [^115dYmki] [^117Gk5bD] [^113d28zs].

> I need to ensure I am not recommending therapies with weak or negative evidence in this phenotype. Oral leukotriene receptor antagonists are not recommended for nonallergic rhinitis, and first-generation oral antihistamines lack supportive trials and carry anticholinergic risks, especially in older adults; if considered at all for refractory postnasal drainage, they should be used with extreme caution and close monitoring [^116xK8VC] [^113RcxwE].

> Next, I should review special populations and precautions. In older adults, avoid sedating antihistamines due to cognitive and anticholinergic risks; ipratropium is often a good choice for rhinorrhea. In pregnancy, avoid oral decongestants in the first trimester and preferentially use topical therapies with shared decision-making. In children under 12, azelastine is not FDA-labeled for vasomotor rhinitis, so I should extrapolate cautiously and prioritize saline, INCS where appropriate, and ipratropium for rhinorrhea, with careful monitoring [^111wk9rN] [^113MV1hA] [^115EDaxU].

> I should confirm monitoring and follow-up cadence. Reassess at 10–14 days after initiating or changing therapy, track control with a validated instrument or VAS, and adjust based on response; if control is inadequate, escalate per the algorithm, and if multiple steps fail, refer for procedural consultation and re-evaluate the diagnosis to ensure no missed structural, infectious, or allergic component [^1162pZty] [^114WLdXq] [^113TBBCi].

> Let me synthesize a practical, stepwise algorithm while keeping the evidence limitations in mind. Start with trigger avoidance and intranasal saline, then choose intranasal antihistamine or intranasal corticosteroid based on predominant symptoms and patient preference, add ipratropium for persistent rhinorrhea, escalate to combination INCS/INAH for moderate to severe disease, consider short-course topical decongestant for severe edema, and for refractory cases proceed to procedural options such as posterior nasal nerve ablation or targeted turbinate surgery, with reassessment at each step and shared decision-making given the conditional strength of many recommendations [^113TBBCi] [^111EDF8z] [^113GgMvg] [^114QhXAB].

> Finally, I should double-check key takeaways to ensure internal consistency. Azelastine has the most consistent FDA-backed evidence for vasomotor rhinitis in patients 12 and older, with rapid onset and broad symptom coverage; INCS are reasonable, especially for congestion, but benefits are modest and epistaxis risk is real; ipratropium is the go-to for rhinorrhea; and procedural neuro-ablation offers durable benefit in carefully selected refractory cases, all within a stepwise, patient-centered framework [^115EDaxU] [^115rfotL] [^115NAqYc] [^114QhXAB].

---

Vasomotor rhinitis is best managed with a **stepwise approach** [^113TBBCi] that starts with intranasal antihistamines (azelastine) [^111SsWCb] or intranasal corticosteroids [^113XEfQb] as first-line therapy, then escalates to combination therapy [^111EDF8z] if symptoms persist. Intranasal ipratropium is added for **predominant rhinorrhea** [^114MqzcU] [^115NAqYc], and short-term intranasal decongestants are reserved for severe congestion [^113GgMvg] [^1156aUdA]. Avoid oral antihistamines, leukotriene receptor antagonists [^116xK8VC], and long-term decongestants due to limited efficacy or rebound risk [^1123NiKx]. For refractory cases, consider posterior nasal nerve procedures (cryoablation, radiofrequency, or botulinum toxin) [^114QhXAB] [^115kPDbM] [^115dYmki]. Environmental trigger avoidance and saline irrigation support control, and therapy should be individualized with reassessment at 2–4 weeks [^111wvd7v].

---

## Pharmacological management

### First-line therapies

- **Intranasal antihistamines (INAH)**: Azelastine is recommended as first-line monotherapy [^111SsWCb] for its rapid onset and efficacy in reducing rhinorrhea, congestion, and sneezing [^113iuipL] [^113QwDc2].

- **Intranasal corticosteroids (INCS)**: Fluticasone, mometasone, or budesonide are options [^113XEfQb], particularly for congestion-predominant symptoms, though efficacy varies and epistaxis risk exists [^115rfotL].

- **Combination therapy**: INCS plus INAH (e.g. azelastine/fluticasone) is recommended for moderate-to-severe or refractory cases [^111EDF8z], providing superior symptom control [^111oysec].

---

### Second-line therapies

Add **intranasal ipratropium** [^114MqzcU] for persistent rhinorrhea, especially with cholinergic hyperactivity [^117FnCGe]. Use **short-term intranasal decongestants** (oxymetazoline) for up to 5 days [^113GgMvg] in severe congestion, avoiding prolonged use to prevent rebound [^1123h5qU] [^115s5uzM].

---

### Therapies not recommended

Avoid **oral antihistamines** due to limited efficacy and sedation [^notfound]; **leukotriene receptor antagonists** are not recommended for non-allergic rhinitis [^116xK8VC]; and **long-term intranasal decongestants** should be avoided because of rebound risk [^113GgMvg].

---

## Non-pharmacological management

- **Environmental modifications**: Identify and avoid triggers (strong odors, smoke, temperature changes, irritants) [^117FnCGe].

- **Saline irrigation**: Regular nasal saline rinses reduce irritant exposure and improve mucosal hydration.

- **Patient education**: Teach proper spray technique, adherence, and recognition of adverse effects [^112My3Ts].

---

## Surgical and procedural interventions

- **Posterior nasal nerve ablation**: Cryoablation or radiofrequency ablation of the posterior nasal nerve provides durable symptom improvement in refractory cases [^114QhXAB] [^117Gk5bD].

- **Botulinum toxin injection**: Intranasal botulinum toxin can reduce rhinorrhea and congestion in resistant VMR [^115dYmki].

- **Inferior turbinate reduction**: Radiofrequency or submucosal resection improves nasal airflow in select patients [^111zxxwc].

---

## Special considerations

In older adults, **avoid sedating antihistamines** and use intranasal therapies with caution [^111wk9rN]. In pregnancy, **prefer saline irrigation and intranasal corticosteroids**; avoid decongestants, especially in the first trimester [^113MV1hA]. In pediatrics, **intranasal corticosteroids are first-line**; azelastine is approved for children ≥ 5 years, and ipratropium is an option for rhinorrhea.

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Reassess at **2–4 weeks** [^notfound] to evaluate control and adherence, then adjust therapy accordingly. Use validated tools such as the **reflective Total Nasal Symptom Score (rTNSS)** to quantify response [^115XtaBa]. Continue periodic reassessment to maintain control and manage adverse effects [^114WLdXq].

---

Vasomotor rhinitis is managed with a **stepwise approach**, starting with intranasal antihistamines or corticosteroids, escalating to combination therapy, and adding ipratropium or short-term decongestants as needed. Refractory cases may benefit from posterior nasal nerve procedures, and all care should be individualized with trigger avoidance and regular follow-up.

### Vasomotor rhinitis [^111xNwqq]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Vasomotor rhinitis affects millions of Americans and results in significant symptomatology. Characterized by a combination of symptoms that includes nasal obstruction and rhinorrhea, vasomotor rhinitis is a diagnosis of exclusion reached after taking a careful history, performing a physical examination, and, in select cases, testing the patient with known allergens. According to a 2002 evidence report published by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), there is insufficient evidence to reliably differentiate between allergic and nonallergic rhinitis based on signs and symptoms alone. The minimum level of diagnostic testing needed to differentiate between the two types of rhinitis also has not been established. An algorithm is presented that is based on a targeted history and physical examination and a stepwise approach to management that reflects the AHRQ evidence report and U.S. Food and Drug Administration approvals. Specific approaches to the management of rhinitis in children, athletes, pregnant women, and older adults are discussed.

### A novel and effective approach to treating rhinitis with nasal antihistamines [^113iuipL]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

To review existing treatments for rhinitis and summarize data available on the use of a nasal antihistamine (azelastine) in treating allergic and nonallergic vasomotor rhinitis.

Data Sources

Relevant articles and references published between 1995 and 2007 regarding the treatment of allergic and vasomotor rhinitis were identified from PubMed, review articles, meta-analyses, and practice guidelines.

Study Selection

All key relevant articles were reviewed and the most relevant selected for inclusion in this review.

Results

The efficacy and safety of azelastine nasal spray in treating allergic rhinitis and vasomotor rhinitis have been determined in a number of U.S. multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. In all trials, azelastine was associated with a rapid onset of action and a sustained improvement over time in rhinitis, congestion, and other symptoms. In patients with allergic rhinitis, the combination of azelastine and nasal corticosteroids increased treatment efficacy by more than 40% compared with either product alone.

Conclusions

Intranasal antihistamine therapy represents an effective mode of drug delivery in patients with allergic and nonallergic vasomotor rhinitis and is an important option for rhinitis therapy, particularly if rapid symptom relief is required or if congestion is a major symptom. Use of azelastine plus nasal corticosteroids is effective in both allergic rhinitis and vasomotor rhinitis, suggesting that this combination represents an effective treatment strategy for all patients with either allergic or nonallergic vasomotor rhinitis.

### Treatment of nonallergic perennial rhinitis [^116aafQN]. Allergy (2004). Low credibility.

Nonallergic perennial rhinitis (also commonly referred to as vasomotor rhinitis) is a chronic non-IgE-mediated condition that is characterized by symptoms which are similar to those seen in allergic rhinitis, but which persist for over nine months each year. Although treatment of vasomotor rhinitis involves the use of either intranasal corticosteroids or antihistamines, the corticosteroids are generally not effective in treatment of all the symptoms of vasomotor rhinitis and have generally been shown to be effective in patients with eosinophilia. With the exception of azelastine, the only topical antihistamine to be approved by the FDA for the treatment of nonallergic rhinitis, the antihistamines have also produced inconsistent results. While clinical studies of azelastine have demonstrated that this drug is highly efficacious in the treatment of all the symptoms of vasomotor rhinitis, mechanistic studies have demonstrated that azelastine has potent anti-inflammatory effects (in particular attenuation of the expression and synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines, leukotrienes, and cell adhesion molecules), which are likely to contribute to its clinical efficacy. Furthermore, pharamacokinetic studies have suggested that since azelastine has a more rapid onset of action, compared to most other antihistamines and intranasal corticosteroids, then azelastine nasal spray may be considered as primary therapy for patients with symptoms of both allergic and/or vasomotor (nonallergic perennial) rhinitis.

### Nonallergic rhinopathy: a comprehensive review of classification, diagnosis, and treatment [^111wvd7v]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

Chronic nonallergic rhinitis syndromes encompass various conditions, of which vasomotor rhinitis is the most common form, representing approximately 80% of patients, also referred to as nonallergic rhinopathy (NAR), nasal hyperreactivity, neurogenic rhinitis, or idiopathic rhinitis. Expert panels have recommended replacing vasomotor rhinitis terminology because it is more descriptive of this condition that is characterized by symptoms triggered by chemical irritants and weather changes through chemosensors, mechanosensors, thermosensors, and/or osmosensors activated through different transient receptor potential calcium ion channels. Elucidating the specific role of transient receptor potential vanilloid 1, triggered by capsaicin, has been an important advancement in better understanding the pathophysiology of NAR because it has now been shown that downregulation of transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 receptors by several therapeutic compounds provides symptomatic relief for this condition. The classification of NAR is further complicated by its association with allergic rhinitis referred to as mixed rhinitis, which involves both immunoglobulin E-mediated and neurogenic mechanistic pathways. Comorbidities associated with NAR, including rhinosinusitis, headaches, asthma, chronic cough, and sleep disturbances, underscore the need for comprehensive management. Treatment options for NAR include environmental interventions, pharmacotherapy, and in refractory cases, surgical options, emphasizing the need for a tailored approach for each patient. Thus, it is extremely important to accurately diagnose NAR because inappropriate therapies lead to poor clinical outcomes and unnecessary health care and economic burdens for these patients. This review provides a comprehensive overview of NAR subtypes, focusing on classification, diagnosis, and treatment approaches for NAR.

First-generation oral antihistamines for nonallergic rhinitis (NAR)/vasomotor rhinitis (VMR) — There are no DBPC trials evaluating the therapeutic efficacy and safety of first-generation oral antihistamines for NAR/VMR; some clinicians suggest that monitored use may be considered for bothersome postnasal drainage refractory to other therapies. Decisions should be individualized with physician–patient shared decision-making, patients should be carefully monitored, the lowest effective dose used, and agents discontinued if side effects occur; special caution is advised in frail elderly patients and in individuals with chronic disorders or those working with heavy machinery, driving, or flying.

### Nonallergic rhinitis: treatment [^111oysec]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Chronic nonallergic rhinitis (NAR) is a syndrome rather than a specific disease. A lack of understanding of the pathogenesis of this condition has led to imprecise terminology with several alternate names for the condition, including vasomotor rhinitis, nonallergic rhinopathy, and idiopathic rhinitis. The therapy for NAR is best based on the underlying pathology, which typically exists in a form whereby an abnormality of the autonomic nervous system is dominant or a form in which inflammation seems to be the cause of symptoms. In general the most effective therapy is the combination of an intranasal antihistamine and an intranasal corticosteroid.

### Efficacy of azelastine nasal spray in the treatment of vasomotor (perennial nonallergic) rhinitis [^113QwDc2]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Azelastine hydrochloride is an antihistamine with anti-inflammatory properties that is available in the United States in a nasal spray formulation for the treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis. Vasomotor (perennial nonallergic) rhinitis (VMR) is a noninfectious, chronic rhinitis usually not associated with inflammatory cell infiltration.

Objective

Two multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group clinical trials were conducted to determine whether patients with symptoms of VMR (rhinorrhea, sneezing, postnasal drip, and nasal congestion) could be effectively treated with azelastine nasal spray.

Methods

All of the patients who participated in the trials had a diagnosis of VMR, symptoms for at least 1 year, negative skin tests for a mixed panel of seasonal and perennial allergens, and a nasal cytology examination negative for eosinophils. After a 1-week, single-blind, placebo lead-in period, patients who met the symptom severity qualification criteria were randomized to receive either azelastine nasal spray (two sprays per nostril twice daily, 1.1 mg/day) or placebo nasal spray for 21 days. Patients recorded the severity of their VMR symptoms on diary cards each morning and evening of the trial using a four-point symptom rating scale (0 = none to 3 = severe). The primary efficacy variable was the overall reduction from baseline in the total vasomotor rhinitis symptom score (TVRSS) over the 21-day, double-blind treatment period.

Results

In both studies, azelastine nasal spray significantly (study 1, P = 0.002; study 2, P = 0.005) reduced the TVRSS from baseline when compared with placebo. Significant improvement was observed within the first week and improvement in all symptoms favored treatment with azelastine nasal spray. No serious or unexpected adverse events were reported in either study. Bitter taste (19% vs 2%) was the only adverse experience that occurred with a statistically significantly greater incidence in the azelastine group than in the placebo group.

Conclusions

This is the first demonstration of the efficacy of an antihistamine in the therapy of VMR in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials.

### Intranasal corticosteroids for non-allergic rhinitis [^115rfotL]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Non-allergic rhinitis is defined as dysfunction and non-infectious inflammation of the nasal mucosa that is caused by provoking agents other than allergens or microbes. It is common, with an estimated prevalence of around 10% to 20%. Patients experience symptoms of nasal obstruction, anterior rhinorrhoea/post-nasal drip and sneezing. Several subgroups of non-allergic rhinitis can be distinguished, depending on the trigger responsible for symptoms; these include occupation, cigarette smoke, hormones, medication, food and age. On a cellular molecular level different disease mechanisms can also be identified. People with non-allergic rhinitis often lack an effective treatment as a result of poor understanding and lack of recognition of the underlying disease mechanism. Intranasal corticosteroids are one of the most common types of medication prescribed in patients with rhinitis or rhinosinusitis symptoms, including those with non-allergic rhinitis. However, it is unclear whether intranasal corticosteroids are truly effective in these patients.

Objectives

To assess the effects of intranasal corticosteroids in the management of non-allergic rhinitis.

Search Methods

The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register; Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2019, Issue 7); PubMed; Ovid Embase; CINAHL; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 1 July 2019.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing intranasal corticosteroids, delivered by any means and in any volume, with (a) placebo/no intervention or (b) other active treatments in adults and children (aged ≥ 12 years).

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. The primary outcomes were patient-reported disease severity and a significant adverse effect - epistaxis. Secondary outcomes were (disease-specific) health-related quality of life, objective measurements of airflow and other adverse events. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome.

Main Results

We included 34 studies (4452 participants); however, only 13 studies provided data for our main comparison, intranasal corticosteroids versus placebo. The participants were mainly defined as patients with perennial rhinitis symptoms and negative allergy tests. No distinction between different pheno- and endotypes could be made, although a few studies only included a specific phenotype such as pregnancy rhinitis, vasomotor rhinitis, rhinitis medicamentosa or senile rhinitis. Most studies were conducted in a secondary or tertiary healthcare setting. No studies reported outcomes beyond three months follow-up. Intranasal corticosteroid dosage in the review ranged from 50 µg to 2000 µg daily. Intranasal corticosteroids versus placebo Thirteen studies (2045 participants) provided data for this comparison. These studies used different scoring systems for patient-reported disease severity, so we pooled the data in each analysis using the standardised mean difference (SMD). Intranasal corticosteroid treatment may improve patient-reported disease severity as measured by total nasal symptom score compared with placebo at up to four weeks (SMD -0.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.15 to -0.33; 4 studies; 131 participants; I² = 22%) (low-certainty evidence). However, between four weeks and three months the evidence is very uncertain (SMD -0.24, 95% CI -0.67 to 0.20; 3 studies; 85 participants; I² = 0%) (very low-certainty evidence). Intranasal corticosteroid treatment may slightly improve patient-reported disease severity as measured by total nasal symptom score change from baseline when compared with placebo at up to four weeks (SMD -0.15, 95% CI -0.25 to -0.05; 4 studies; 1465 participants; I² = 35%) (low-certainty evidence). All four studies evaluating the risk of epistaxis showed that there is probably a higher risk in the intranasal corticosteroids group (65 per 1000) compared to placebo (31 per 1000) (risk ratio (RR) 2.10, 95% CI 1.24 to 3.57; 4 studies; 1174 participants; I² = 0%) (moderate-certainty evidence). The absolute risk difference (RD) was 0.04 with a number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) of 25 (95% CI 16.7 to 100). Only one study reported numerical data for quality of life. It did report a higher quality of life score in the intranasal corticosteroids group (152.3 versus 145.6; SF-12v2 range 0 to 800); however, this disappeared at longer-term follow-up (148.4 versus 145.6) (low-certainty evidence). Only two studies provided data for the outcome objective measurements of airflow. These data could not be pooled because they used different methods of outcome measurement. Neither found a significant difference between the intranasal corticosteroids and placebo group (rhinomanometry SMD -0.46, 95% CI -1.06 to 0.14; 44 participants; peak expiratory flow rate SMD 0.78, 95% CI -0.47 to 2.03; 11 participants) (very low-certainty evidence). Intranasal corticosteroids probably resulted in little or no difference in the risk of other adverse events compared to placebo (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.12; 3 studies; 1130 participants; I² = 0%) (moderate-certainty evidence). Intranasal corticosteroids versus other treatments Only one or a few studies assessed each of the other comparisons (intranasal corticosteroids versus saline irrigation, intranasal antihistamine, capsaicin, cromoglycate sodium, ipratropium bromide, intranasal corticosteroids combined with intranasal antihistamine, intranasal corticosteroids combined with intranasal antihistamine and intranasal corticosteroids with saline compared to saline alone). It is therefore uncertain whether there are differences between intranasal corticosteroids and other active treatments for any of the outcomes reported.

Authors' Conclusions

Overall, the certainty of the evidence for most outcomes in this review was low or very low. It is unclear whether intranasal corticosteroids reduce patient-reported disease severity in non-allergic rhinitis patients compared with placebo when measured at up to three months. However, intranasal corticosteroids probably have a higher risk of the adverse effect epistaxis. There are very few studies comparing intranasal corticosteroids to other treatment modalities making it difficult to draw conclusions.

### Drug-induced rhinitis [^1163cGmv]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Rhinitis is characterized by inflammation of the mucous membranes lining the nose and can be divided into two categories, allergic and non-allergic. Drug-induced is a type of non-allergic rhinitis.

Objective

A review of the literature was conducted. Very little is known about this topic and there are no publications to date solely devoted to drug-induced rhinitis.

Methods

A PubMed and Medline search was conducted using a combination of the keywords; drug, medication, rhinitis, congestion, rhinorrhea, sneezing, pruritus, vasomotor, reflex, neurogenic, allergic and non-allergic. Medications that were found in the search were then cross-referenced with the physicians desk reference and Epocrates. The final literature search was conducted in August 2009.

Results

Three categories of drug-induced rhinitis exist based on the mechanism of action. These include local inflammatory, neurogenic and idiopathic types. Rhinitis medicamentosa, a form of drug-induced rhinitis, has unique characteristics.

Conclusion

When possible, the offending medication should be discontinued or substituted. Although there are no established treatment recommendations for drug-induced rhinitis other than avoidance, clinical experience suggests that it would be reasonable to initiate use of an intranasal corticosteroid spray to treat symptomatically. The addition of an intranasal antihistamine in combination with use of an intranasal corticosteroid may be considered as step-up therapy if the intranasal corticosteroid alone is not effective.

### The effect of intranasal injection of botulinum toxin A on the symptoms of vasomotor rhinitis [^115dYmki]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose

Vasomotor rhinitis (VMR) is a common disease that is unrelated to allergy, infection, structural abnormalities, and systemic diseases. Patients with VMR usually complain of nasal obstruction accompanied by profuse watery nasal discharge. The exact pathophysiologic mechanisms of VMR are not known. Some studies suggested that it results from an autonomic nervous system dysfunction. No effective long-term treatment modalities exist for the VMR.

Materials and Methods

Thirty patients with VMR were randomly and equally divided into 2 groups. The mean age was 38.46 years (range, 18–59 years; 1 men, 14 women) for group 1 and 41.60 (range, 29–62 years; 4 men, 11 women) for group 2. Five patients with VMR were accepted as a control group. Fifteen patients were injected 10 U of botulinum toxin A (BTX-A) (group 1) and patients in group 2 were injected 20 U to inferior and middle turbinates. Control patients were injected with saline solution into the inferior and middle turbinates.

Results

Total symptom scores generally decreased after the first week and increased after the eighth week. The symptoms of patients (nasal obstruction, sneezing, nasal discharge, and nasal itching) were scored from 1 to 5, with 1 as less severe and 5 as most severe. The statistical significance of the results was analyzed using Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U test. When total symptom scores of group 1 (10 U BTX-A) were compared with the control group, there was a statistically significant difference regarding symptoms scores at all control weeks. There was also a statistically significant difference for total symptom scores between group 2 and control group, except for the first control week.

Conclusion

Intranasal injection of BTX-A is a highly effective, safe, and simple symptomatic treatment modality with a long-lasting effect for patients with VMR. Botulinum toxin A may be a good alternative especially for the treatment of resistant VMR cases.

Calcitonin for postmenopausal osteoporosis — use, dosing, efficacy, and safety: Injectable and nasal spray recombinant salmon calcitonin are approved by the FDA for treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis, with an approved injectable dosage of 100 IU daily given subcutaneously or intramuscularly and an approved nasal spray dose of 200 IU (1 spray) daily; the main contraindication is drug hypersensitivity, and for suspected sensitivity, skin testing is recommended before treatment. There are no published studies with injectable calcitonin that show antifracture efficacy; nasal spray calcitonin (200 IU daily) reduces risk of new vertebral fractures, whereas a lower dose (100 IU daily) or a higher dose (400 IU daily) were ineffective for vertebral fracture reduction, and the approved dose was not shown to reduce hip or nonvertebral fracture risk. Calcitonin produces a minimal increase in spine BMD in women > 5 years after onset of menopause and does not increase BMD at other sites; a clinical study of 5 years' duration indicated a good safety profile, and safety and efficacy data are available through 5 years, but when stopped, skeletal benefits are lost relatively quickly during the subsequent 1 or 2 years. Adverse effects include nausea, local inflammatory reactions, and vasomotor symptoms with parenteral use, and nasal discomfort (including rhinitis, mucosal irritation, and occasional epistaxis) with nasal use; overall, use with either route is well tolerated. Primarily because more effective agents are available, we recommend limiting the use of calcitonin as long-term treatment for osteoporosis, though short-term prescriptions are often given to patients with acute painful vertebral fractures with hopes of an analgesic effect. A meta-analysis of 21 randomized clinical trials showed a higher incidence of malignancy in calcitonin-treated patients, while the FDA did not find sufficient evidence for a causal relationship and urged individualized risk–benefit assessment.

### Traumatic unilateral vasomotor rhinitis [^114tLUG8]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Vasomotor rhinitis (VMR) is a commonly encountered entity that may be difficult to diagnose. The classic symptoms are clear rhinorrhea and nasal congestion, commonly brought on by exercise, stress, heat, cold, and environmental irritants. The diagnosis is one of exclusion, and management usually involves avoidance of inciting agents and treatment with an anticholinergic nasal spray. We describe a case of VMR in a 22-year-old woman who presented with symptoms of clear, left-sided rhinorrhea and epiphora that had begun shortly after a motor vehicle accident approximately 1.5 years earlier, but which she had not reported at that time. The patient's left carotid canal had been fractured and the surrounding sympathetic plexus injured in the accident, resulting in an overactive parasympathetic system. Both exercise and heat exacerbated her symptoms. Allergy was excluded by negative allergy testing, and the patient did not respond to fluticasone nasal spray. Given the mechanism of injury, the unilaterality of symptoms, and the patient's lack of response to nasal steroids, it was thought that the VMR was due to the earlier traumatic injury, which had resulted in imbalance of the autonomic neural input. A trial of ipratropium was given to directly treat the parasympathetic overactivity. This treatment resulted in immediate improvement in both the nasal and lacrimal secretions.

### Rhinitis 2020: a practice parameter update [^117FnCGe]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Vasomotor rhinitis (VMR) — clinical features, diagnosis, and proposed neurogenic mechanisms are outlined as follows: VMR, a subtype of NAR, can be acute or chronic and is often activated by temperature and humidity changes, especially cold air, dry air, airborne irritants, strong odors, including tobacco smoke, and/or exercise. The symptoms of VMR are variable, consisting mainly of nasal obstruction and increased clear secretion, with sneezing and pruritus less common and cough a common component. The diagnosis of VMR is based on exclusion of other forms of rhinitis and the history is the most important determinant leading to diagnosis, with laboratory tests, skin prick tests, and sIgE helpful only to exclude AR; nasal challenge may be used in research to assess drug efficacy but is rarely used for clinical diagnosis. More recently, optical rhinometry with intranasal capsaicin challenge has been demonstrated to assist in the diagnosis of a subset of patients with VMR and nonallergic irritant rhinitis. While the pathophysiology of VMR is not fully understood, there is evidence that it involves a neurogenic pathway with an imbalance between parasympathetic and sympathetic nasal innervation, with support from the beneficial effects of ipratropium bromide and vidian neurectomy. Subjects with predominant rhinorrhea appear to have enhanced cholinergic glandular secretory activity that can be effectively reduced with the use of atropine and ipratropium bromide, whereas patients with predominant nasal congestion appear to have nociceptive neurons that have heightened sensitivity to stimuli such as temperature change, airborne irritants, foods, alcoholic beverages, cold dry air, and exercise. Somewhat conflicting research suggests that intranasal capsaicin acting at TRPV1 may induce symptoms of VMR, and patients with irritant rhinitis have higher TRPV1 expression in the nasal mucosa and higher concentrations of substance P in nasal secretions; from these data, the term "neurogenic rhinitis" has been proposed to replace VMR and idiopathic rhinitis to describe this type of NAR.

### Surgical management of nonallergic rhinitis [^117Gk5bD]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Nonallergic rhinitis (NAR) describes chronic symptoms of nasal congestion, obstruction, and rhinorrhea unrelated to a specific allergen based on skin or serum testing. Vasomotor rhinitis is the most frequent subtype of NAR. Although medical management is the first-line treatment of NAR, there is a role for surgical therapy when medications fail to improve symptoms. Surgical options for NAR include inferior turbinate reduction and botulinum toxin injection as well as more directed targeting of the autonomic nerve supply to the nasal cavity through vidian neurectomy, posterior nasal neurectomy, and cryoablation of the posterior nerve.

### Questionnaire evaluation and risk factor identification for nonallergic vasomotor rhinitis [^115TWYMz]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic rhinitis, a prevalent primary care disorder associated with significant comorbidities, is often incorrectly diagnosed. As a result, inappropriate treatment leads to higher health care costs and poor clinical outcomes.

Objective

To verify whether responses to specific questions may help in the diagnosis of nonallergic vasomotor rhinitis (NAVMR).

Methods

A questionnaire listing allergic and nonallergic triggers was blindly distributed to 100 random new patients with chronic rhinitis in an allergist's office. Questionnaire and physician diagnoses were compared. Allergic triggers included cat, dog, feathers, other furry animals, and symptoms during the spring, summer, and fall seasons. Nonallergic triggers included temperature changes, diesel and car exhaust, tobacco smoke, perfumes and fragrances, incense, cleaning products, newsprint, hairspray, and alcoholic beverages, spicy foods, or eating.

Results

The construct validity and internal consistency indicated that the questionnaire was a good tool for diagnosing NAVMR. Multivariate analysis revealed that the absence of outdoor symptoms in the spring (odds ratio [OR], 7.76; 95% confidence interval, 1.18–51.22; p = 0.03), no parental history of allergy (OR, 5.16; 95% CI, 1.05–25.20; p = 0.04), no symptoms around cats (OR, 3.82; 95% CI, 0.59–24.83; p = 0.16), the presence of symptoms around perfumes and fragrances (OR, 4.875; 95% CI, 1.05–22.60; p = 0.04), and age at symptom onset (OR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.02–1.14; p = 0.008) were predictive of NAVMR.

Conclusions

Specific questionnaire responses may help primary care physicians accurately diagnose NAVMR. Questions asked of patients by physicians to diagnose allergic rhinitis do not correlate well with physician diagnosis.

### Cryosurgical ablation for treatment of rhinitis: a prospective multicenter study [^114QhXAB]. The Laryngoscope (2020). Medium credibility.

This study demonstrated favorable treatment responses to cryoablation for chronic rhinitis. The present study built on the prior published pilot data for cryoablative treatment with the Clarifix device, 5 adding a larger patient cohort, more rigorous capture of longer‐term follow‐up timepoints, a validated quality‐of‐life outcome measure, and tracking of medication usage. Although the pilot study reported statistically significant improvements in posttreatment rTNSS scores, the current study builds on those findings and includes an analysis of patients demonstrating clinically meaningful improvements in rTNSS scores. The rate of patients exceeding the MCID at 6 months of 78.9% found in the current is comparable to the findings of the previously published pilot study, which noted symptomatic improvement in 74% patients at 6 months.

It is noteworthy that cryoablation appeared to benefit patients with both AR and NAR. This effect was also noted in the pilot study, although treatment numbers were smaller in the pilot study. 5 Despite the fact that improvement in AR symptoms might be unexpected at first glance, prior surgical outcomes studies have demonstrated that patients with AR who underwent posterior nerve neurectomy experienced significant improvements in their rhinitis symptoms. 20 Tissue sampling of the inferior turbinate following surgical ablation of the PNN has revealed a reduction in the number of infiltrating neutrophils, eosinophils, and lymphocytes, 21 suggesting that disruption of the autonomic innervation may reduce the inflammatory cell populations that are pathologic in both AR and NAR. In our study, we observed that improvements in overall rTNSS score in AR patients were mostly due to improvements in nasal congestion and rhinorrhea, with minor improvements in sneezing and no change in nasal itchiness. The improvements observed in the AR subcohort of this study suggest a potential role of cryotherapy in treatment of AR. However, owing to the binary classification of our patients into NAR or AR subcohorts, we cannot rule out the possibility that some AR patients actually had mixed rhinitis and theoretically could have benefited from treatment of the NAR component of their rhinitis. Additionally, this study is limited in that we did not further subclassify NAR subjects into rhinitis subtypes. Further study is warranted regarding the potential indications of PNN cryoablation for specific rhinitis subtypes, such as vasomotor or senile rhinitis.

The most frequently reported adverse reactions (≥ 2%) with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray were headache, pyrexia, cough, nasal congestion, rhinitis, dysgeusia, viral infection, upper respiratory tract infection, pharyngitis, pain, diarrhea, and epistaxis. In the azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray treatment group, 7 patients (2%) had mild epistaxis and 1 patient (< 1%) had moderate epistaxis. In the fluticasone propionate nasal spray treatment group 1 patient (< 1%) had mild epistaxis. No patients had reports of severe epistaxis. Focused nasal examinations were performed and no nasal ulcerations or septal perforations were observed. Eleven of 404 patients (3%) treated with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray and 6 of 207 patients (3%) treated with fluticasone propionate nasal spray discontinued from the trial due to adverse reactions.

### Rhinitis 2020: a practice parameter update [^117NvJnL]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Rhinitis 2020 practice parameter — methods and recommendation framework explain scope, grading, and development: "This guideline contains systematically developed recommendations intended to optimize care of adult and adolescent patients and to assist physicians and/or other health care practitioners and patients to make decisions regarding diagnosis and therapy for rhinitis". For younger children, "the application of recommendations to children would be partially based on data extrapolation from adult studies and would therefore be less certain". Because "GRADE documents require a comprehensive literature search, systematic review, and meta-analysis for each question", resource constraints mean "the only GRADE recommendations are those that were previously published in the 2017 rhinitis guideline update". The remainder are "consensus-based statements (CBSs)", for which "The strength of the CBSs is determined to be either strong or conditional" and "The certainty of evidence for each recommendation is determined to be high, moderate, low, or very low". Development steps include that "At least 2 work group members are assigned to write and review each section" and that "all sections are reviewed and revised by the entire work group through several rounds of electronic and teleconference reviews".

### The airway neuro-immune axis as a therapeutic target in allergic airway diseases [^116YzQjk]. Respiratory Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Sympathetic nerves influence airway immunity in allergic rhinitis

In addition to norepinephrine, secreted by sympathetic nerves in the nasal mucosa and acting as a potent vasoconstrictor, sympathetic nerves also release neuropeptide Y (NPY). NPY-secreting nerve fibers are predominantly located in arteries and veins, with a smaller number in the epithelium and glands. This distribution suggests that NPY plays a crucial role in regulating blood flow. For example, in the human nasal mucosa, NPY may constrict arteries and regulate vasomotion. Additionally, NPY enhances the vasoconstrictive effects of NE. While sympathetic nerves predominantly maintain vascular tone under normal circumstances, NPY counters the proinflammatory and vasodilatory effects of neurotransmitters and neuropeptides released from parasympathetic and sensory nerves in allergic conditions.

Nonallergic rhinitis (NAR) pharmacologic treatment algorithm — guidance statement: As with AR, we recommend that a clinician use guidance from an algorithm (see Figs 4 and 5) that is based on multiple considerations including relative effectiveness, onset of action, potential for adverse effects, patient preference, symptom severity, and whether a patient has intermittent or persistent rhinitis. The stepwise progression and decision tree is based largely on expert opinion and account for variable patient adherence in real-life experience. Compared with the evidence for making treatment decisions in AR, the evidence for making recommendations for treatment of NAR is generally more limited, and there are fewer treatment options.

### Azelastine [^115XtaBa]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

In dose-ranging trials, administration of Azelastine HCl Nasal Spray two sprays per nostril twice daily resulted in a statistically significant decrease in symptoms compared to saline placebo within 3 hours after initial dosing and persisted over the 12-hour dosing interval.

One Spray Per Nostril Twice Daily

The efficacy and safety of Azelastine HCl Nasal Spray were evaluated in two placebo-controlled clinical trials of Azelastine HCl Nasal Spray including 275 patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis who received one spray per nostril twice a day for up to 2 weeks. Assessment of efficacy was based on the 12hour reflective Total Nasal Symptom Score [rTNSS]. rTNSS is calculated as the sum of the patients scoring of four individual nasal symptoms (runny nose, sneezing, itchy nose, and nasal congestion) as assessed by patients on a 0 to3 categorical scale. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from Baseline to Day 14 in rTNSS. The mean change from baseline in rTNSS was greater in patients receiving Azelastine HCl Nasal Spray one spray per nostril twice daily than those receiving placebo (Table 4).

### Local production of IgE in the respiratory mucosa and the concept of entopy: does allergy exist in nonallergic rhinitis? [^115zoAeN]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To review research regarding locally produced IgE and its impact on patients with chronic rhinitis.

Data Sources

PubMed search with the following keywords: entopy, local IgE, nonallergic rhinitis, idiopathic rhinitis, vasomotor rhinitis, and allergic rhinitis.

Study Selection

Articles were selected based on their relevance to entopy and locally produced IgE and its clinical effect and relationship to idiopathic rhinitis (IR).

Results

Local IgE has been found in a variety of tissues, including nasal and bronchial mucosa. IgE is produced in these local tissues and not simply the product of migration to the tissue from regional lymphoid tissue or blood. Local IgE has been identified in most of both atopic and nonatopic asthmatic patients and allergic rhinitis patients. Up to 40% of patients with IR and a positive nasal provocation test result have evidence of locally produced IgE, which has been coined entopy. Although patients with allergic rhinitis and IR show similar inflammatory patterns with increased activated mast cells, eosinophils, and T-cell subsets in some studies, other studies on IR patients are conflicting with regard to both inflammation and allergen-specific nasal provocation test results.

Conclusion

The concept of local allergy in IR patients is both intriguing and controversial. Studies have reported conflicting results, and currently there is no single best test to evaluate for entopy. It is known that there are a large number of IR patients for whom current treatment regimens are suboptimal. Therefore, further research elucidating the mechanisms of IR and the concept of localized IgE are needed to optimally diagnose this condition and treat this group of patients.

### Efficacy and safety of iota-carrageenan nasal spray versus placebo in early treatment of the common cold in adults: the ICICC trial [^112fMLx8]. Respiratory Research (2015). Low credibility.

Consistent trends in favor of I-C for secondary endpoints and statistically significant outcomes for exploratory analyses were also observed for the ICICC trial. The finding that nominally greater treatment effects were seen in the ICICC trial among patients who were virus-positive, is supported by a pooled analysis by Koenighofer, which combined the Fazekas and Ludwig trials. The pooled analysis examined only those patients who were virus-positive, and showed that nominal response rates were higher in virus-positive patients than in all participants of the Ludwig and Fazekas trials.

There may be several reasons for the unexpectedly low power of the trial, which resulted in trends rather than statistically significant outcomes for the primary endpoint and HRV/HEV viral load reductions. First, the proportion of patients for whom a respiratory virus could be detected was smaller than anticipated; respiratory viruses (all groups/types analysed) were found at baseline in only 54.9% of patients (54.1% in the I-C group and 55.7% in the placebo group). Efforts were made to recruit patients with the earliest onset of a common cold. Thus, self-reported cold symptoms were used for patient inclusion criteria, without the requirement for demonstration of virus positivity to enter treatment. Since the early symptoms of common colds may be rather non-specific for respiratory virus infection, these symptoms may present in other conditions such as vasomotor rhinitis, in which certain nonspecific stimuli including changes in environment (temperature, humidity, or barometric pressure), airborne irritants (odors or fumes), dietary factors (spicy food or alcohol) or emotional factors trigger nasal symptoms. Patients inadvertently included with non-infectious conditions would not be expected to respond clinically to antiviral therapy, and therefore are likely to cause an under-estimation of any true antiviral treatment effect. Consistent with this, the ICICC trial demonstrated that among those patients who had quantifiable virus at baseline, the I-C patients had a greater decrease in viral load than did placebo patients, suggesting an antiviral effect of I-C. In addition, TSS 2–4 scores in the patients who were virus-positive at baseline showed strong trend in favor of I-C. However, since this was a subset of the total enrolled population, the virus-positive subset was underpowered for the TSS 2–4 score endpoint. In particular, the percentage of patients with HRV/HEV identified at baseline was substantially smaller than anticipated: only 23.6% had quantifiable virus (22.4% in the I-C group and 24.7% in the placebo group). Other studies using both molecular methods and viral culture have demonstrated that human rhinoviruses are the etiologic agent in 50–90% of common colds. The current trial was also conducted primarily in the fall (October until February), which includes the period of greatest HRV infection incidence. Because virus shedding tends to be the greatest in the first several days of infection and generally continues for up to 2 weeks, it is unlikely that the low positive rate for HRV/HEV infection was due to missing the window of HRV shedding. More likely, the current study was conducted during a season of low HRV prevalence, resulting in fewer than expected infections among trial patients. In two previous clinical trials conducted with I-C, the number of patients with confirmed HRV infection was higher than in the current trial, at 46% and 30% (although these values are as well lower than the percentages reported for other studies). Therefore, the smaller-than-expected number of patients infected with the HRV/HEV viruses likely limited the ICICC trial's ability to differentiate between the I-C and placebo treatments.

### Bipolar radiofrequency-induced thermotherapy of turbinate hypertrophy: pilot study and 20 months' follow-up [^113d28zs]. The Laryngoscope (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives/Hypothesis

The present report is a pilot clinical study about a new bipolar ablation technique for the treatment of turbinate hypertrophy, which offers an alternative to conventional methods.

Study Design

Prospective, clinical.

Methods

From August 1999 to March 2000, a new bipolar radiofrequency system with acoustic feedback control was submucosally applied for the treatment of 38 patients with nasal airway obstruction of vasomotor (n = 31) or allergic (n = 7) genesis. The therapy was made ambulatory with surface anesthesia. Data were collected by questionnaire and rhinomanometry preoperatively and 2 and 20 months postoperatively.

Results

Nearly all patients reported an improvement of their nasal breathing, with 68% of them reporting a full and 29% a partial recovery. No significant differences were reported with regard to the response of the allergic versus the vasomotor rhinitis. On average, a definite benefit was observed after 2 weeks. Side effects, such as bleeding, synechia, or atrophic changes of the mucosa, which would have to be treated, were not observed.

Conclusion

The new bipolar radiofrequency thermotherapy presents an efficient option for the treatment of turbinate hypertrophy, which meets the requirements for an outpatient treatment.

### Inferior turbinate hypertrophy in rhinoplasty: systematic review of surgical techniques [^111zxxwc]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Inferior turbinate hypertrophy is often encountered by plastic surgeons who perform rhinoplasty. Many treatment options are available to treat the inferior turbinate. The objective of this study was to systematically review outcomes of available techniques and provide guidance to surgical turbinate management.

Methods

A MEDLINE search was performed for means of treating inferior turbinate hypertrophy. Studies selected focused on treatment of the inferior turbinate in isolation and excluding patients with refractory allergic rhinitis, vasomotor rhinitis, or hypertrophic rhinitis.

Results

Fifty-eight articles were identified, collectively including the following surgical treatments of inferior turbinate hypertrophy: total turbinectomy, partial turbinectomy, submucosal resection, laser surgery, cryotherapy, electrocautery, radiofrequency ablation, and turbinate outfracture. Outcomes and complications were collected from all studies. Procedures such as turbinectomy (partial/total) and submucosal resection showed crusting and epistaxis at comparatively higher rates, whereas more conservative treatments such as cryotherapy and submucous diathermy failed to provide long-term results. Submucosal resection and radiofrequency ablation were shown to decrease nasal resistance and preserve mucosal function. No literature exists to support the belief that turbinate outfracture alone is an effective treatment for turbinate hypertrophy.

Conclusions

Treatment of inferior turbinate hypertrophy is best accomplished with modalities that provide long-lasting results, preservation of turbinate function, and low complication rates. Submucosal resection and radiofrequency ablation appear to best fulfill these criteria. Turbinate outfracture should only be considered in combination with tissue-reduction procedures.

### Long-term, randomized safety study of MP29–02 (a novel intranasal formulation of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate in an advanced delivery system) in subjects with chronic rhinitis [^115uw7zT]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2014). Low credibility.

Background

MP29–02 is a novel intranasal formulation of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate (FP) in an advanced delivery system for the treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis.

Objective

The objective of this study was to evaluate the long-term safety of MP29–02 in subjects with chronic allergic (perennial) or nonallergic (vasomotor) rhinitis.

Methods

This was a 1-year, randomized, open-label, active-controlled, parallel-group study in subjects with chronic allergic or nonallergic rhinitis. A total of 612 subjects were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to (1) MP29–02, one spray per nostril twice daily (total daily doses of azelastine hydrochloride and FP were 548 mcg and 200 mcg, respectively); or (2) FP, 2 sprays per nostril once daily (total daily dose 200 mcg). Safety and tolerability assessments were made at months 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12.

Results

The incidence of treatment-related adverse events was low with both MP29–02 (9.4%) and FP (11.1%), with no evidence of late-occurring adverse events. Nasal examinations showed no evidence of nasal mucosal ulcerations or septal perforations with MP29–02, and the overall incidence of adverse findings was reduced as the study progressed. There were no unusual or unexpected ocular examination findings and no clinically important laboratory findings or clinically important differences between groups in fasting AM serum cortisol levels after 12 months of treatment.

Conclusions

MP29–02 was well tolerated. There were no safety findings that would preclude the long-term use of MP29–02 in the treatment of allergic rhinitis.

### Laser ablation of posterior nasal nerves for rhinitis [^115kPDbM]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Posterior nasal nerve (PNN) surgery, Radiofrequency (RF), and cryoablation have been described as alternative treatments for allergic and vasomotor rhinitis. We hypothesize that endoscopic (diode) laser ablation (ELA) is effective and less invasive than previously described methods.

Methods

An IRB approved prospective study was performed. Thirty-two patients with chronic rhinitis and nasal congestion resistant to medical management were recruited. Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS) measurements were used to assess symptom severity and treatment outcomes. ELA was performed bilaterally in the clinic with a 940 nm diode laser with CW 5 W output, under topical/local anesthesia in 21 patients, while the remaining 11 were treated under sedation in the operating room. The 400-micron uninitiated diode laser fiber tip with a malleable protective shaft was specially designed for PNN ablation. The fiber was pre-shaped according to the intranasal anatomy and endoscopically advanced toward the posterior middle meatus. Patients were followed up for the first 90 days after treatment.

Results

ELA was successfully completed in 97% of patients. No crusting, epistaxis, or other complications were observed. One patient could not be treated in the office due to limited endoscopic access. TNSS was reduced significantly after30 and 90 days (mean ± SD: 6.0 ± 0.7 prior to ablation, 2.3 ± 0.4 at 90 days, p < .001). Rhinitis and congestion scores decreased at 30 and 90 days after treatment compared to the baseline (p < .001).

Conclusion

ELA of the PNN region is safe and well tolerated both in the office and ambulatory settings. Symptom scores were significantly decreased after 30 and 90 days. This new minimally invasive method appears to be a promising treatment method.

### Rhinitis 2020: a practice parameter update [^113veVVW]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Nonallergic rhinitis (NAR) — definition, clinical associations, and prevalence are described as follows: By definition NAR is defined as rhinitis that is independent of an IgE-mediated mechanism and includes vasomotor rhinitis (VMR), infectious rhinitis, food-induced rhinitis, hormonal rhinitis, drug-induced rhinitis, occupational rhinitis, atrophic rhinitis, NARES, and rhinitis of the elderly. NAR can be acute or chronic, is often present in conjunction with allergic rhinitis (AR) as "mixed rhinitis", and is frequently associated with hyperreactivity of the nasal mucosa. Compared with those with AR, patients with NAR were more likely to be older and to have severe congestion and rhinorrhea but less likely to have asthma. Although the exact prevalence is unknown, some estimates suggest that worldwide up to 200 million people have NAR.

### Association of menopause and rhinitis among adult women in the United States: findings from the all of Us research program [^114hHecT]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Our study found that menopause was independently associated with a lower odds of AR, while there was no association between menopause and NAR after adjusting for covariates.

Given the decrease in hormone levels during menopause, in addition to the fact that AR is primarily inflammation‐mediated, our results could lend support to a role of hormones in the pathogenesis of AR and related inflammatory conditions. On the contrary, NAR is a more heterogeneous condition mediated by predominantly noninflammatory mechanisms. The most common form of NAR, nonallergic rhinopathy (or vasomotor rhinitis), which comprises at least two thirds of NAR, is thought to be mediated by an imbalance in parasympathetic and sympathetic inputs to the autonomic nervous system in response to changes in environmental conditions, weather, strong emotions, smells, or hormones. Other less common forms of NAR may be attributed to tachyphylaxis, as in the case of rhinitis medicamentosa, or progressive atrophy of the nasal mucosa, as in the case of atrophic rhinitis. This lack of inflammation in the pathogenesis of many of the common forms of NAR may explain why no association between menopause and NAR was found in our study.

Although some prior research has examined the relationship between rhinitis and factors such as hormone replacement therapy and long‐term estrogen exposure in postmenopausal women, we are not aware of any studies specifically exploring the connection between menopause and rhinitis in the United States. Our findings contradict those of Lund et al. which found that menopause was associated with an increased likelihood of rhinitis symptoms among adult women in France. This study is the first to investigate the relationship between menopause and both AR and NAR in the United States. We additionally utilized a large and diverse national dataset, incorporating participants of various demographic and socioeconomic backgrounds.

Although more research is needed, establishing menopause as a protective factor against AR could have significant implications in clinical management. Understanding that menopause may reduce the risk of AR could lead to more personalized treatment strategies for women by allowing clinicians to explore treatments that consider a woman's menopausal status. From a public health perspective, women could be encouraged to seek care for AR symptoms earlier in their reproductive years, fostering better management strategies. These insights could also be applied to healthcare policy aimed at improving care for women dealing with allergic conditions throughout different life stages.

Rhinitis is a multifactorial disease characterized by sneezing, rhinorrhea, postnasal drip, and nasal congestion. This condition affects 10% to 40% of the population and is responsible for billions of spent health care dollars and impairment in quality of life for those affected. Currently available medical and vaccine therapies are effective for a large segment of this population; however, a subset of patients still has difficult-to-control rhinitis. This article reviews the current progress being made in novel drug and vaccine development and delves into alternative medical, surgical, and homeopathic strategies that may be promising adjunctive treatments for the difficult-to-treat rhinitis patient.

What AR patients want from treatment

Living with symptomatic AR means coping with any or all of the symptoms of nasal congestion, headache, postnasal drip, repeated sneezing, runny nose and other symptoms on a near-daily basis. AR patients have high expectations from their treatment, but also a high degree of dissatisfaction with AR treatment, for reasons that include: symptom breakthrough, lack of 24-hour coverage, lack of coverage of both nasal and ocular symptoms, and unwanted side effects. Patients want faster and more complete symptom control. Insufficient symptom control with INCS and oral AH is a major concern, and a situation, which has not improved over time. Many physicians underestimate AR severity and consequently fail to issue adequate treatment, a situation which appears to have changed little in a decade.

Whereas very mild rhinitis may be simply and successfully self-managed by patients using medications available over the counter, most patients with rhinitis who present to medical offices have more severe rhinitis that may need a more comprehensive diagnostic and therapeutic approach. Optimal care may require special diagnostic studies and combination therapies that are arrived at only after trying multiple different medication and therapeutic options. This article presents a systematic approach to office care of rhinitis from the perspective of an allergist-immunologist. More emphasis is given to discussion of dilemmas that face the specialist or more involved considerations that have been highlighted in recently published guidelines.

The parents or guardians (carers) of all patients provided written, informed consent ahead of study initiation. Additionally, patients who were able to read and understand the study information signed an Informed Acceptance Form.

This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of once-daily FFNS 55 μg and 110 μg versus vehicle placebo nasal spray in pediatric patients with AR. The study had a treatment-free run-in period (4–14 days) before randomization, followed by 4 weeks of double-blind treatment and a 3–7-day treatment-free follow-up period (Fig. 1).

FFNS fluticasone furoate nasal spray, R randomization.

Patients were eligible for inclusion into the study if they met criteria for either IAR or PAR according to Chinese guidelines, and were 2–12 years of age. Exclusion criteria included comorbid disorders that may have affected study results (including nasal polyps, eye, or upper respiratory infection within 2 weeks of the start of the screening period, asthma [except mild intermittent cases], rhinitis medicamentosa, vasomotor AR, or eosinophil rhinitis), recent nasal septal surgery or perforation, and traveling for > 48 h during the study (potentially experiencing a change in allergens). Use of medication that could significantly affect the course of AR or interact with the study drug was not permitted.

In addition, patients had to meet the following randomization criteria: nasal and/or ocular symptoms on the morning of randomization; an average reflective total nasal symptom score (rTNSS) of ≥ 6 for the last 8 assessments (4 assessments in the morning and 4 assessments in the afternoon) before randomization, including the morning assessment at randomization; and average reflective nasal score symptom assessment for congestion of ≥ 2 for the last 8 assessments (4 assessments in the morning and 4 assessments in the afternoon) before randomization, including the morning assessment at randomization.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^112K1rtP]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) — management when initial antibiotic therapy fails includes counseling and reassessment. During initial management, patients should be counseled to call and/or schedule a follow up appointment if symptoms are worsening or not improving after 3 to 5 days on appropriate initial antibiotic therapy, and clinicians should confirm the diagnosis of ABRS by applying the diagnostic criteria in Table 4. If the patient does not have the symptom cluster of up to 4 weeks of purulent nasal drainage alongside nasal obstruction, facial pain-pressure-fullness, or both, alternate diagnoses should be explored; common mimics include migraines, tension headaches, cluster headaches, temporomandibular joint disorders, and noninfectious nasal conditions such as allergic rhinitis, vasomotor rhinitis, deviated nasal septum, and nasal valve collapse. The presence of purulent or discolored drainage from the middle meatus or sphenoethmoid recess is suggestive of a bacterial process; a culture may help direct appropriate antibiotic therapy if purulent drainage is identified, but blind nasal or nasopharyngeal swabs are not recommended, and such cultures should be taken from the middle meatus or sphenoethmoid recess.

PATIENT: How To Use Instructions

FOR INTRANASAL USE ONLY

IMPORTANT: FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY TO ENSURE PROPER DOSING.

DOSING: The dosage of Astelin®Nasal Spray is 1 spray per nostril twice daily for pediatric patients (ages 5–11 years) with seasonal allergic rhinitis. For patients age 12 and older with seasonal allergic rhinitis the dosage is one or two sprays per nostril twice daily. For patients age 12 and older with nonallergic vasomotor rhinitis the dosage is two sprays per nostril twice daily. Keep your head tilted downward when spraying. Alternate sprays between nostrils. Breathe gently to avoid drawing any medication into the throat.

Follow the instructions below to use your Astelin®Nasal Spray pump.

TO PRIME:

Remove and retain the blue spray tip dust cover and blue safety clip.
Prime for initial use by putting two fingers on the shoulders of the spray pump unit and place your thumb on the bottom of the bottle. Press upward with thumb, release, and repeat until a fine mist appears (4 sprays or less). Now your pump is primed and ready to use.
If the solution is delivered in a stream of liquid, it may fail to provide maximum benefit and cause some discomfort. A fine mist can be produced only by a rapid and firm pumping action.
When 3 or more days have elapsed since the last use, the pump should be reprimed with 2 sprays or until a fine mist appears.

### Medical management of rhinitis: medication options [^115ryTEF]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2026). Medium credibility.

Pharmacologic treatment of rhinitis includes intranasal and oral therapies targeting inflammation and histamine activity. Intranasal corticosteroids and non-sedating antihistamines are first-line due to high efficacy and safety. Intranasal ipratropium, cromolyn, and decongestants offer symptom-specific relief. Oral medications such as antihistamines, leukotriene receptor antagonists, decongestants, and corticosteroids, vary in efficacy and side effects. Emerging therapies like biologics and CRTH2/DPP-4 inhibitors show promise in clinical and preclinical studies.

### Enhanced airway sensory nerve reactivity in non-eosinophilic asthma [^112kcbr3]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2021). High credibility.

Consistent with other studies, baseline lung function was not associated with capsaicin response. However, following capsaicin challenge, FEV 1%-predicted and FVC%-predicted were slightly decreased across all groups with no differences between subgroups. This is in agreement with previous studies showing that capsaicin does not cause clinically significant bronchoconstriction in asthmatics. Our results suggest that while capsaicin produces an increased tussive response in NEA, it is not associated with clinically significant AHR in this (or any other) group.

The observation that increased sensory nerve reactivity is associated with NEA may have significant implications. As reported previously, NEA makes up > 50% of asthmaand is less responsive to ICS, the mainstay drug in asthma management. There is therefore a substantial and unmet need in the therapeutic management of this group. If sensory nerve reactivity plays a role in the pathology underlying NEA and is therefore a potential treatable trait, then accurately identifying individuals with increased airway sensory reactivity, and developing specific therapeutic approaches targeting this, will be important. Of particular interest, recent reports suggest that anticholinergics (which are effective in some but not all asthma)may markedly reduce airway reactivity to a variety of stimuli including capsaicin. Tiotropium bromide reduces both cough and cough-reflex sensitivity in asthma refractory to ICS/LABA. Alternatively, P2X3 antagonists (which have shown promise in the treatment of refractory chronic cough) may be of benefit. However, it is currently unclear whether these will be effective in NEA, which was not associated with nocturnal cough symptoms in this study. It is also possible that capsaicin treatment itself may be beneficial in sensory nerve hyperreactivity in NEA, as has been shown in vasomotor rhinitis. Finally, in addition to results being relevant to treatment, our findings suggest that capsaicin challenge, in conjunction with other methods such as sputum induction, AHR, FeNO and atopy testing, may be a useful tool to differentiate between asthma phenotypes, and provide important clues regarding causal (non-allergenic) exposures.

### Comparison of long term results after Ho: YAG and diode laser treatment of hyperplastic inferior nasal turbinates [^1123h5qU]. Lasers in Surgery and Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Background and Objective

Various laser systems have been used to reduce the volume of hyperplastic inferior nasal turbinates during the last 25 years. Although there are many studies reporting the clinical results immediately after laser treatment, there are only a few describing long-term results. Therefore, a clinical study was performed to assess and to compare the long-term outcome of both endonasal Ho:YAG and endonasal diode laser-assisted turbinate surgery.

Study Design/Materials and Methods

In the first treatment group, a total of 80 patients (allergic rhinitis (46%) and vasomotor rhinitis (54%)) suffering from nasal obstruction due to hyperplastic inferior nasal turbinates were treated by a pulsed Ho:YAG laser emitting light at a wavelength of lambda = 2,100 nm (pulse energy: 0.8–1.2 J/pulse, repetition rate: 4–8 Hz) under local anesthesia. In the second group, an additional 113 patients (allergic rhinitis (52%) and vasomotor rhinitis (48%)) were treated by means of a continuous wave GaAlAs-diode laser emitting light at a wavelength of lambda = 940 nm (power: 8–10 W). The treatment time was 3–10 minutes per turbinate and the nasal cavities were left unpacked following the procedure. The study concerning long-term effects was conducted using a standardized questionnaire, allergy test, and rhinomanometry within a follow-up period of 6 month and after 3 years. All patients were refractory to conservative medical treatment prior to laser treatment.

Results

Three years after laser treatment, a subjective improvement of nasal airflow had been described by the patients in 67.5% after Ho:YAG- and in 74.4% after diode laser treatment. Rhinomanometry revealed a significant improvement of the nasal airflow at both 6 months and 3 years after the laser treatment as compared to the preoperative data. Side effects like nasal dryness and pain were rare (< 5%) and occurred only during the first weeks after the intervention. After diode laser treatment, patients showed nasal obstruction due to postoperative edema and nasal crusting during the first 3–4 weeks, whereas patients from the Ho:YAG laser group described these symptoms only for a period of 1–2 weeks.

Conclusion

Both Ho:YAG- and diode laser treatment, which are performed as an outpatient procedure under local anesthesia, show promising long-term results. It has therefore, developed to become a time and cost-effective treatment modality in endonasal laser surgery at our institution. While short-term differences concerning the healing process after Ho:YAG- compared to diode-laser treatment could be ascertained according to the subjective and objective evaluation, no significant long-term differences between the two investigated groups could be observed.

### Rhinitis 2020: a practice parameter update [^1123NiKx]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Drug-induced rhinitis — mechanisms and causative agents — can be classified as local inflammatory, neurogenic, and idiopathic; an acute inflammatory response may follow ingestion of acetylsalicylic acid or other NSAIDs, and alpha- and beta-adrenergic blockers produce rhinorrhea and nasal congestion through a neurogenic mechanism. Responsible pharmacological agents include centrally acting sympatholytic drugs (eg, clonidine, reserpine, methyldopa), peripherally acting sympatholytic drugs (eg, guanethidine, phentolamine), ganglion-blocking drugs (eg, trimethaphan), and vasodilators including phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitors (eg, sildenafil). Many other drugs can produce nasal symptoms, such as calcium channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, gabapentin, and psychotropic medications (eg, risperidone, chlorpromazine). The effect of exogenous estrogens and oral contraceptives on nasal physiology is uncertain, with reports of reduced allergen-provoked nasal congestion during ovulation but increased sneezing at the end of the menstrual cycle, and overuse of topical decongestants can result in rhinitis medicamentosa.

Elderly rhinitis — prevalence, pathophysiology, and treatment considerations: In older adults, rhinitis is common, occurring "in up to 30% of the elderly, with > 40% of these patients rating their rhinitis as moderate/severe, and almost 70% experiencing ocular symptoms", and "drug-induced rhinitis is not infrequent". Age-related nasal changes are described, and "the clear rhinorrhea reported to be the major rhinitis symptom in over 70% of this older population" is linked to "cholinergic hyperactivity and excessive rhinorrhea". For management, "intranasal ipratropium seems to be a logical intervention", while "Second-generation oral antihistamines, INAH, leukotriene inhibitors, and INCS are effective and well tolerated in the elderly… but controlled data… are lacking". Importantly, "Sedating antihistamines… should be avoided in the elderly due to the risk of urinary retention, constipation, delirium, and ocular pressure changes", and a "2015 US prospective population-based cohort study" suggested a dementia risk signal with stronger anticholinergic agents including sedating oral antihistamines.

Oral antihistamine with oral decongestant in allergic rhinitis — We suggest that for patients with allergic rhinitis (AR) and nasal congestion uncontrolled with an oral antihistamine, the clinician consider the addition of pseudoephedrine, when tolerated. Strength of recommendation: Conditional. Certainty of evidence: Moderate. Controlled studies demonstrate that the combination of an oral antihistamine and an oral decongestant is more effective than the individual components, although pharmacologic options other than this combination generally are preferred; pseudoephedrine is far superior to other decongestants. If a fixed combination is chosen, side effects such as insomnia should be considered, and if side effects occur the dose should be adjusted, if possible, or the fixed combination stopped and either separate monotherapy products selected.

### Nonallergic rhinitis: diagnosis [^111Ma6ja]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Nonallergic rhinitis (NAR) is one of the most common conditions in medicine, affecting the quality of life of millions of patients throughout the United States. Despite its ubiquitous nature, NAR remains a poorly managed and often difficult to treat condition. NAR is often suboptimally managed by clinicians with poor clinical outcomes. Establishing the correct diagnosis requires a keen understanding of the unique underlying mechanisms involved in NAR, which is still evolving. Ultimately epidemiologic studies that better define NAR prevalence and its economic burden on society are needed to convince funding agencies of the need for research to elucidate mechanisms and specific treatment approaches for this condition.

Intranasal capsaicin — While capsaicin "has not been approved by the FDA for the treatment of rhinitis", it has been used in nonallergic or mixed rhinitis; studies in allergic rhinitis (AR) "did not find a significant effect in reducing nasal hyperreactivity or in improving rhinorrhea", and a Cochrane analysis "found only 1 small trial" with benefit in AR. For idiopathic nonallergic rhinitis (NAR), a Cochrane analysis reports symptom improvement "which can last 36 weeks after treatment", though based on "only a few small studies of low scientific evidence quality". Comparative data show greater symptom reduction with capsaicin in idiopathic versus mixed rhinitis "(79% and 68%, respectively)".

### Inflammatory and infectious upper respiratory diseases associate with 41 genomic loci and type 2 inflammation [^111w4tMw]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Inflammatory and infectious upper respiratory diseases (IURD) affect the sinonasal tract, pharynx, and larynx, and include diseases such as chronic tonsillitis, allergic rhinitis, and chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). They lead to increased morbidity, and costs, and to the highest public health burden in the worldby serving as the main route of infection to the body, and by their connection to non-communicable diseases, such as asthma –, autoimmune diseases, cardiovascular diseases, and obesity. Genetic predisposition – together with environmental megatrends such as the COVID-19 pandemic –, Western lifestyle, urbanization, global warming, and dysbiosis, influence the burden of IURDs. IURDs often co-exist –, and they have shown overlapping mechanisms. Understanding the genetic (dis)similarities behind IURDs can remarkably improve preventive actions and therapies, and reduce the burden of IURDs and related diseases.

IURDs are characterized by an etiology related to recurrent infections and dysbiosis, leading to chronic and treatment-resistant diseaseswith acute and even life-threatening exacerbations. IURDs involve inflammation in the nasal cavity, such as vasomotor and allergic rhinitis (VAR), both characterized by hyperresponsiveness to stimuli; non-specific chronic rhinitis, nasopharyngitis and pharyngitis (CRNP) and nasal septal deviation (NSD); and in the adjoining paranasal sinuses, such as CRS with or without nasal polyps (NP). Allergic rhinitis (AR) is a part of an allergic disease entity involving allergic asthma, atopic dermatitis, allergic conjunctivitis and food allergy. IURDs also encompass other diseases of the pharynx such as chronic laryngitis and laryngotracheitis (CLT), chronic diseases of tonsils and adenoids (CDTA), and peritonsillar abscess (PA). Previous genetic studies of non-allergic IURDs and related immune responses have largely focused on rare variantsand the HLA region. IURD-related GWAS have been reported of CRS and NP, tonsillectomy and childhood ear infections, cold sores, mononucleosis, strep throat, pneumonia and myringotomy, and of infective diseases caused by specific airway-related microbes such as pneumococcusand staphylococcus aureus. The common variant burden of allergic diseases such as AR have been more extensively studied. However, no prior research has analyzed shared genetic contributions of IURDs.

### Neurokinin 3 receptor antagonism rapidly improves vasomotor symptoms with sustained duration of action [^114x7YFY]. Menopause (2018). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

The novel data that we report in this manuscript, which details the time course of the effect of an NK3R antagonist to relieve menopausal symptoms and the impact on sleep, fit entirely with the preexisting literature and are timely as there is significant interest in the NK3R antagonist class as a future therapeutic for vasomotor symptoms. Larger scale studies assessing efficacy, safety, and optimal dosing strategy are already underway. If these studies are also positive and provide good long-term safety data, then this novel approach of using NK3R antagonism to treat menopausal flushing will be practice changing.

Vasomotor rhinitis is a pathologic condition of the nose produced by a local or a remote disturbance in the vasomotor mechanism. It is noninfectious in origin. It may, however, occur with an infectious or with an allergic condition of the nose.

1. There are three types of the disease: 2 acute vasomotor rhinitis; subacute or chronic vasomotor rhinitis, and vasomotor rhinitis, acute or chronic, with osseous hypertrophy. The acute form is characterized by: profuse watery discharge; pale, edematous, boggy, water-logged mucosa, and evanescent obstruction of the nose. In the chronic type there is evidence of repeated attacks of inflammation of the mucosa, manifested by the appearance of polypoid degeneration in different parts. FISHOF FE.

### Ten days' use of oxymetazoline nasal spray with or without benzalkonium chloride in patients with vasomotor rhinitis… [^115s5uzM]. JAMA Network (1999). Excellent credibility.

Mean change in minimal cross-sectional area from baseline after histamine hydrochloride challenge of the nasal mucosa before and after 10 days' treatment with oxymetazoline hydrochloride nasal spray with and without benzalkonium chloride, as measured with acoustic rhinometry. The nasal mucosa was challenged with histamine hydrochloride, 1, 2, and 4 mg/mL, applied to 1 side of the nose. Recordings were made before and 5 minutes after each challenge. Design Double-blind, randomized, controlled, parallel study. Patients Thirty-five patients with vasomotor rhinitis selected from our outpatient department. Intervention. Results No rebound swelling was found after the 10-day treatment in the 2 groups with either of the methods or as estimated by symptom scores. In the group receiving oxymetazoline containing benzalkonium chloride, but not in the other group, the histamine sensitivity was significantly reduced after treatment.

Most nasal drops and sprays are multidose preparations that contain a preservative to prevent the growth of microorganisms. Oxymetazoline and xylometazoline produce immediate, powerful, long-lasting decongestion, and therefore it is clinically important to establish for how long these drugs may safely be used without risking the development of RM. We have previously shown that it is safe to use oxymetazoline containing benzalkonium chloride in healthy subjects 3 times daily for 10 days. 4 However, Åkerlund and Bende3 report that 3 weeks' regular use of xylometazoline containing benzalkonium chloride induces rebound swelling in patients with vasomotor rhinitis, but not in healthy subjects. The study was designed as a parallel, randomized, double-blind trial.

Thirty-five patients with vasomotor rhinitis were randomized for treatment with oxymetazoline nasal spray either with or without benzalkonium chloride in the morning and in the evening for 10 days. Nasal mucosal swelling and nasal reactivity, as estimated by histamine challenge, were studied with rhinostereometry and acoustic rhinometry before and after treatment, and symptom scores of nasal stuffiness were estimated throughout the treatment. All patients were selected from the outpatient department of the ear, nose, and throat clinic at Huddinge University Hospital or Södersjukhuset, Stockholm, Sweden.
