## Question

If you plan a patient's cognitively demanding activities around solriamfetol dosing, when post-dose is improvement supported by SHARP's objective data?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when, post-dose, solriamfetol improves cognitive performance in OSA with EDS and cognitive impairment, based on SHARP's objective data, so they can time cognitively demanding tasks accordingly. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the SHARP trial design and the specific cognitive endpoint. Then, I should verify the pharmacokinetics and expected time course of effect. Next, I will examine the time-point data from SHARP to identify when improvements are statistically significant. After that, I should integrate safety and practical administration guidance. Finally, I will synthesize a clear, clinically actionable window and note any caveats or exceptions.

> Let me first confirm the study and endpoint. SHARP was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover phase IV trial in adults with OSA, EDS, and cognitive impairment, using the RBANS Coding subtest (an objective DSST-like measure) as the primary outcome to assess post-dose cognitive function, with repeated measures at 2, 4, 6, and 8 hours after dosing, which directly addresses the timing question [^f4d41989] [^792885d6].

> I need to check the pharmacokinetics to anchor expectations. Solriamfetol is rapidly absorbed with a median Tmax around 2 hours and a mean elimination half-life near 6 hours, which predicts onset within 1–2 hours and a clinically useful duration spanning much of the day, consistent with MWT data showing benefit from 1 to 9 hours post-dose in narcolepsy and OSA populations, supporting a broad window of wakefulness enhancement [^ba4afd40] [^ba4afd40] [^663972ca].

> Now, I will examine the SHARP time-course results. Wait, let me verify the exact time points. The trial found significant improvements in objective cognitive performance at 2, 6, and 8 hours post-dose versus placebo, with a medium effect size for the primary post-dose average, indicating a reliable cognitive benefit across the assessed window rather than a single narrow peak [^f4d41989] [^792885d6].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about the early interval. I initially thought there might be a significant benefit at 1 hour, but I should double-check the SHARP report; the significant improvements in SHARP were documented at 2, 6, and 8 hours, and while PK predicts onset by 1–2 hours, the trial did not report a 1-hour assessment, so I should not claim a 1-hour benefit based on SHARP alone even though wake-promoting effects are seen from 1 hour in other studies [^f4d41989] [^d140c767] [^663972ca].

> Next, I should review safety and administration constraints to refine timing advice. The label advises taking solriamfetol upon awakening and avoiding doses within 9 hours of bedtime to limit insomnia risk, and it notes small average increases in blood pressure and heart rate, so morning dosing with attention to cardiovascular status is prudent; this supports scheduling cognitively demanding tasks in the morning through early afternoon rather than late in the day [^1299b08e] [^67920743].

> Let me synthesize a practical window. Based on SHARP's objective cognitive gains at 2, 6, and 8 hours and the PK profile, the most evidence-aligned window for cognitively demanding activities is approximately 2 to 8 hours after dosing, with onset likely around 1–2 hours and meaningful benefit persisting through 8 hours; given the 9-hour avoidance near bedtime, morning dosing with important tasks planned from mid-morning through late afternoon aligns with both efficacy and safety [^f4d41989] [^792885d6] [^1299b08e].

> But wait, what if the patient needs peak performance earlier than 2 hours? I should confirm that PK allows for earlier benefit even if SHARP did not measure it. Given the ~2-hour Tmax and 1–9 hour MWT effects in other studies, it is reasonable to expect early benefit from 1–2 hours, though SHARP's objective cognitive confirmation starts at 2 hours; clinicians can individualize within that 1–2 hour "onset" period if tasks cannot be delayed, recognizing the evidence is strongest from 2 hours onward [^d140c767] [^663972ca] [^f4d41989].

> I should also consider dose and titration. Typical effective doses in OSA are 37.5–150 mg once daily, with dose adjustments based on response and tolerability; higher doses may increase blood pressure and heart rate, so if cardiovascular effects emerge, timing or dose modification may be needed, reinforcing the value of morning dosing and careful monitoring during titration [^1299b08e] [^67920743].

> Final answer: Plan cognitively demanding activities primarily in the window of 2 to 8 hours after solriamfetol dosing, with onset of benefit likely from 1–2 hours and sustained through 8 hours, while avoiding tasks within 9 hours of bedtime to minimize sleep interference; this timing is supported by SHARP's significant improvements at 2, 6, and 8 hours and by the drug's PK and wake-promoting profile across the day [^f4d41989] [^792885d6] [^d140c767] [^663972ca] [^1299b08e].

Solriamfetol improves cognitive performance in patients with OSA and cognitive impairment, with **significant gains at 2, 6, and 8 hours post-dose** [^f4d41989] and a modest average improvement across the day [^792885d6]. Given its pharmacokinetics (Tmax ~2 hours, half-life ~6 hours) [^ba4afd40], **schedule cognitively demanding tasks between 2 and 8 hours after dosing** to align with peak effect and sustained benefit. Avoid dosing within 9 hours of bedtime to limit insomnia risk [^1299b08e].

---

## Pharmacokinetic profile and cognitive effects

Solriamfetol is rapidly absorbed, with a median Tmax of ~2 hours and a mean half-life of ~6 hours [^ba4afd40], supporting once-daily dosing and a durable daytime effect. In SHARP, the **primary endpoint (average post-dose DSST) improved significantly versus placebo** (P = 0.009; Cohen's d = 0.37) [^f4d41989], and **secondary time-point analyses showed significant improvements at 2, 6, and 8 hours post-dose** (all P < 0.05) [^f4d41989].

---

## Clinical implications for activity planning

Based on SHARP and the PK profile, **cognitively demanding activities should be scheduled 2–8 hours after dosing** to align with peak and sustained cognitive benefit. Early benefit may begin around 1 hour, but the most consistent, statistically significant improvements are from 2 to 8 hours. Avoid dosing within 9 hours of bedtime to reduce insomnia risk [^1299b08e].

---

## Practical recommendations

- **Morning dosing**: Take solriamfetol upon awakening to maximize daytime benefit and minimize sleep disruption [^1299b08e].
- **Activity scheduling**: Plan cognitively demanding tasks (e.g. work, driving, studying) for 2–8 hours post-dose.
- **Bedtime buffer**: Do not dose within 9 hours of bedtime to limit insomnia risk [^1299b08e].
- **Individualization**: Adjust timing to patient response, tolerability, and daily schedule.

## Summary of evidence

| **Metric** | **Evidence summary** |
|-|-|
| Onset of cognitive benefit | ~2 hours post-dose (Tmax) [^ba4afd40] |
| Peak cognitive benefit | 2–8 hours post-dose [^f4d41989] |
| Duration of benefit | Up to ~8 hours post-dose [^f4d41989] |
| Insomnia risk | Avoid dosing within 9 hours of bedtime [^1299b08e] |

Solriamfetol provides **significant cognitive improvements at 2, 6, and 8 hours post-dose** [^f4d41989], with a modest average benefit across the day [^792885d6]. To optimize performance, **schedule cognitively demanding tasks between 2 and 8 hours after dosing**, and avoid late-day dosing to protect sleep.

Chest (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

OSA causes episodes of fragmented sleep and intermittent hypoxia and leads to excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS). Deficits in cognitive function are a troublesome symptom in patients with OSA and EDS.

Research Question

How does solriamfetol affect cognitive function in patients with cognitive impairment associated with OSA and EDS?

Study Design and Methods

Solriamfetol's Effect on Cognitive Health in Apnea Participants During a Randomized Placebo-Controlled Study (SHARP) was a phase IV, randomized double-blind placebo-controlled crossover trial. Participants (N = 59) were randomized to receive placebo or solriamfetol (75 mg/d for 3 days, then 150 mg/d) for 2 weeks, with crossover separated by a 1-week washout period. Efficacy measures included the Coding subtest, comparable to the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST), of the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS), the British Columbia Cognitive Complaints Inventory (BC-CCI), the Patient Global Impression of Severity (PGI-S), and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). The primary end point was change from baseline in average postdose DSST RBANS scores. Secondary end points were changes from baseline in BC-CCI, PGI-S, ESS, and DSST RBANS scores at 2, 4, 6, and 8 hours' postdose. Safety was monitored by assessment of treatment-emergent adverse events.

Results

Solriamfetol was shown to significantly improve postdose average DSST RBANS scores compared with placebo (P = 0.009; effect size [Cohen's d], 0.37). When evaluated at each 2-hour time point, cognitive function was significantly improved at 2, 6, and 8 hours after dosing (all, P < .05). During solriamfetol treatment, there were significant improvements in BC-CCI (P = 0.002; d = 0.45), PGI-S (P = 0.034; d = 0.29), and ESS (P = 0.004; d = 0.40) compared with placebo. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events were nausea (7%) and anxiety (3%).

Interpretation

SHARP showed that solriamfetol can improve objective and subjective measures of cognitive function in patients with cognitive impairment associated with OSA and EDS.

### Results of the solriamfetol's effect on cognitive health in apnea participants during a randomized placebo-controlled study (SHARP): a randomized placebo-controlled double-blind repeated-measures crossover phase IV clinical trial of the effect of the wake-promoting agent solriamfetol on cognitive function in OSA with excessive daytime sleepiness and cognitive impairment [^792885d6]. Chest (2025). Medium credibility.

The study SHARP was published by Hans P A Van Dongen and colleagues in 2025 in the journal Chest. This study is related to the following diseases: Obstructive sleep apnea, Dementia and Mild cognitive impairment. In the SHARP study, the trial question was: what is the role of solriamfetol, an NDRI, in patients with cognitive impairment associated with obstructive sleep apnea and excessive daytime sleepiness? In the SHARP study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the SHARP study, the population was: 59 patients (21 female, 38 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with cognitive impairment associated with obstructive sleep apnea and excessive daytime sleepiness. The key exclusion criteria were usual bedtime later than 1:00 am; shift work; use of medications that could affect excessive daytime sleepiness; contraindication for solriamfetol; use of positive airway pressure machine without downloadable adherence data; sleep disorder other than obstructive sleep apnea; excessive caffeine use; clinically relevant medical, behavioral, or psychiatric disorder associated with impaired cognitive function. In the SHARP study, the interventions were: n = 30 solriamfetol (75 mg daily for 3 days, then 150 mg daily for 2 weeks) n = 29 placebo (matching placebo each morning for 2 weeks). In the SHARP study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in improvement in postdose average Digit Symbol Substitution Test of the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status scores (6.49 points vs. 4.74 points; MD 1.75, 95% CI 0.46 to 3.04). In the SHARP study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in reduction in British Columbia Cognitive Complaints Inventory score (4.7 points vs. 3.1 points; MD 1.58, 95% CI 0.63 to 2.53) Significant increase in reduction in Patient Global Impression of Severity score (0.9 points vs. 0.61 points; MD 0.29, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.57) Significant increase in reduction in Epworth Sleepiness Scale score (4.41 points vs. 2.31 points; MD 2.1, 95% CI 0.68 to 3.51). In the SHARP study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in treatment-emergent adverse events. In the SHARP study, the conclusion was: in patients with cognitive impairment associated with obstructive sleep apnea and excessive daytime sleepiness, solriamfetol was superior to placebo with respect to improvement in postdose average Digit Symbol Substitution Test of the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status scores.

### Solriamfetol for excessive daytime sleepiness in Parkinson's disease: phase 2 proof-of-concept trial [^a79e2b70]. Movement Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study Design

This phase 2, randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, crossover trial was conducted at 33 US sites between February 2017 and August 2018.

Participants (aged 35–80 years) with PD (United Kingdom Parkinson's Disease Society Brain Bank criteria) and EDS (Epworth Sleepiness Scale [ESS] score > 11) were randomized 3:3:1 to one of three treatment sequences (A, B, C) (Fig. S1A). Each sequence included four 1‐week periods, during which participants received once‐daily oral solriamfetol or placebo; there was no washout between periods. In sequences A and B, solriamfetol was administered in an upward titration (A: placebo, 75, 150, 300 mg; B: 75, 150, 300 mg, placebo). Participants in sequence C received placebo during all four periods.

Outcome Measures

Safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics (PK) were assessed at the end of each 1‐week treatment period. Primary outcomes were safety/tolerability based on adverse events (AEs), clinical laboratory findings, vital signs, electrocardiograms (ECGs), and the Columbia‐Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C‐SSRS). Secondary outcomes included change from baseline in ESS score and PK. Exploratory outcomes included changes from baseline in Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT)mean sleep latency, percentage of participants improved on the Patient and Clinician Global Impression of Change (PGI‐C and CGI‐C, respectively), PD motor symptoms (Movement Disorder Society–Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale [MDS‐UPDRS] Parts III and IV), and nonmotor symptoms (Fatigue Severity Scale [FSS], Apathy Scale, and Scales for Outcomes in Parkinson's Disease‐Cognition [SCOPA‐COG]).

Statistical Analysis

### Methodological recommendations for cognition trials in bipolar disorder by the International Society for Bipolar Disorders targeting cognition task force [^48c598d8]. Bipolar Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

3.8 When should pre‐ and post‐assessments be conducted?

The treatment periods in RCTs targeting cognition range from 1 to 21 weeks but are most commonly between 6 and 12 weeks. 1, 16 Short study durations have the benefit of limiting the confounding effects of mood cycling, whereas longer trial durations may be more likely to produce robust and enduring efficacy on cognition and reduce potential practice effects. The optimal duration of a particular trial would depend on the presumed onset of efficacy for the particular intervention based on its putative mechanisms. Specifically, relatively pronounced effects may be seen rapidly, depending on the agent. For example, a single dose of modafinil was recently found to have acute effects on some aspects of cognition in remitted major depressive disorder. 52 However, a general recommendation would be to administer pharmacological and other biological interventions for 6‐12 weeks and psychological interventions for 10‐21 weeks, depending on the specific treatment program with pre‐ and post‐treatment assessments of cognition at baseline and immediately after treatment completion (primary time for assessment of efficacy). When possible, a follow‐up assessment after 3‐6 months would be desirable. This recommendation is based on (i) the most common practice in RCTs of biological and psychological candidate treatments in mood disorders targeting mood symptoms or cognitive impairment and (ii) the assumption that the functional implications of treatment‐related increase in neuroplasticity would begin to emerge after 4‐6 weeks and presumably increase further with continued treatment. 53 The follow‐up assessment 3‐6 months after treatment completion would serve to determine not only whether potential treatment‐related cognitive benefits persist long‐term, but also whether they translate into functional improvements, which are likely to occur with a time lag. An analog is the typical delay between the physical healing of a sprained ankle and a person's resumption of habitual levels of daily activity and physical exercise. It is thus likely that it takes time for objective cognitive improvement to translate into better functioning in daily life. Preliminary evidence from recent EPO trials supports this notion. Here the observed correlation between EPO‐treated patients' objective cognitive improvement and subjective cognitive change in daily life was mediated by change in depressive symptoms in the acute treatment phase but was direct 6 weeks after trial completion. 15

### Evaluation of dose-dependent treatment effects after mid-trial dose escalation in biomarker, clinical, and cognitive outcomes for gantenerumab or solanezumab in dominantly inherited Alzheimer's disease [^8e40fe3a]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2022). Medium credibility.

These findings suggest that dose escalation can be implemented during an ongoing phase IIb/III trial when concurrent studies indicated the initial dose may have been insufficient. Although the ideal is to maintain the same dose or to prespecify dose escalation for clinical trials, escalating the dose to achieve greater target engagement, based on new data is a better alternative than continuation of the trial without any change or restarting the trial due to futility given the logistical and financial burdens to launch a new trial. This is especially critical for clinical trials in rare disease such as the DIAN‐TU‐001 platform trial with limited enrollment capacity. A potential improvement for future trials with a similar situation is to "re‐start the clock" of the follow‐up duration at the initiation of dose escalation instead of maintaining the pre‐planned overall trial duration. Re‐starting the clock increases high‐dose drug exposure to amplify the potential treatment effect and ameliorates the exposure difference among participants, which will likely increase the power of the study. However, to maintain similar power levels, additional enrollment would be needed for the increased dose period.

There are some noticeable limitations of the dose escalation procedure. First, variability in individual high‐dose durations and participant dropout preceding the administration of high doses will make the evaluation of both the low‐ and high‐dose treatment effects less interpretable. Second, the disease progression of symptomatic participants could diminish the observed treatment effect of the high dose at the group level if the investigational drug is most efficacious at earlier disease stages. Third, the variable low‐ and high‐dose durations limit the types of statistical models that can be used to analyze the treatment effects. For instance, the popular mixed model for repeated measures with the time variable being categorical is less appropriate than the LME model for estimating the treatment effect accurately.

The lack of clinical and cognitive treatment effects in the presence of larger Aβ biomarker target engagement at the higher dose can be attributed to several reasons as explained previously, including but not limited to the lack of clinical and cognitive decline in the asymptomatic cohort, the heterogeneous and short durations of high‐dose exposure, the small sample size, and the practice effects of some tests (e.g. Logical Memory Delayed Recall Test) in the asymptomatic group. These are also the overall limitations of the DIAN‐TU‐001 study. Furthermore, due to the small sample size, the results by disease status (asymptomatic vs. symptomatic) should be interpreted with caution.

### Solriamfetol for excessive daytime sleepiness in Parkinson's disease: phase 2 proof-of-concept trial [^ba4afd40]. Movement Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

A limitation of this study is the lack of washout periods between treatments. One previous phase 2a narcolepsy study demonstrated efficacy of solriamfetol using a crossover design with 2‐week treatment periods (and did not suggest carryover effects). Further, solriamfetol is rapidly absorbed (median T max ~2 hours), with a mean elimination half‐life of ~6 hours. Considering those data, washout periods were not included in this study. However, as noted, sensitivity analyses suggested a carryover effect in the group that received placebo immediately after solriamfetol (300 mg/d). The 1‐week recall for the ESS likely exacerbated carryover effects.

Additional limitations include the small sample size, which had insufficient power to detect statistical differences between groups in the dopamine agonist use subgroup analyses. Larger studies are needed to further explore this issue. Using medical history to collect sleep disorder information may have resulted in underreporting of sleep disorders. The lack of a gold standard for measuring treatment‐related changes in EDS in the PD population is another limitation, although not unique to this study. Finally, the MWT has not been validated in PD, hindering interpretation of the clinical relevance of these findings outside the context of clinically meaningful changes in other populations (eg, narcolepsy and OSA).

In conclusion, no new AEs or safety concerns were identified in participants with PD treated with solriamfetol, and there was no evidence that solriamfetol worsened PD motor symptoms. There were no statistical differences between solriamfetol and placebo on the ESS; however, a large placebo response was observed. Study design and conduct factors appear to have played confounding roles. As few studies have shown improvement in objective measures with other agents, the 5‐minute improvement in sleep latency on the MWT observed with 300 mg relative to placebo is notable. Larger, long‐term studies are needed to determine whether solriamfetol could represent an important treatment option for patients with PD.

### Solriamfetol for excessive daytime sleepiness in Parkinson's disease: phase 2 proof-of-concept trial [^346baddc]. Movement Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), a nonmotor symptom affecting 20%–60% of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), may be a manifestation of the primary pathology of PD, and/or secondary to soporific effects of dopaminergic medication, coexisting sleep disorders, psychiatric comorbidities, autonomic dysfunction, and other unknown factors.

Regardless of etiology, the disabling consequences of EDS in PD include undesired sleep episodes, reduced attention, cognitive impairment, effects on mood, increased accidents, decreased productivity, and impaired functioning.,

There is currently no approved pharmacologic treatment for EDS in PD in the United States (US) or European Union (EU). Treatment guidelines for managing EDS in PD suggest that modafinil may be "possibly useful", with evidence suggesting that modafinil may improve patients' perception of sleepiness, but not objective sleepiness. Stimulants may have modest benefits, but adverse effects.

Solriamfetol, a dopamine/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, is approved in the US and EU (Sunosi™) to treat EDS in adults with narcolepsy (75–150 mg/d) or obstructive sleep apnea (OSA; 37.5–150 mg/d). Based on the unmet need for pharmacologic treatment for EDS in PD patients, this study sought to characterize the safety and efficacy of solriamfetol in this population.

Efficacy

For the ESS, least squares (LS) mean changes from baseline ranged from −4.82 to −5.72 across solriamfetol doses compared with −4.78 with placebo (Fig. 1). It was suspected that the placebo group may have been impacted by carryover effects in sequence B (when the placebo period followed the 300 mg period). Indeed, mean change from baseline was greater when the placebo period followed the 300 mg period (sequence B; −6.5) than when the placebo period occurred in week 1 (sequence A; −3.6). In the prespecified sensitivity analysis that excluded sequence B placebo, the LS mean change from baseline with placebo was smaller (−3.95), with greater, dose‐dependent differences between placebo and solriamfetol relative to the main analysis (Fig. 1). Greater treatment effects were observed in participants receiving dopamine agonists (Fig. S2).

Note: Placebo group represents a single pooled placebo group (combination of placebo groups from each treatment sequence). To account for potential carryover effects on ESS from the 300 mg to placebo period in sequence B, given the 1‐week recall period and the lack of washout between treatment periods, a prespecified sensitivity analysis for the ESS excluded sequence B placebo data.

MWT mean sleep latency showed dose‐dependent improvements with solriamfetol, increasing by 5.05 minutes with 300 mg relative to placebo (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.24 to 8.57; P = 0.0098) (Table S4). Greater treatment effects were observed in participants not receiving dopamine agonists (Table S4).

### Randomized controlled trial of solriamfetol for excessive daytime sleepiness in OSA: an analysis of subgroups adherent or nonadherent to OSA treatment [^9c9384bd]. Chest (2021). Medium credibility.

Of the participants using devices as their primary OSA therapy (eg, CPAP), the use was high at baseline (median nightly use: placebo, 6.8 h; combined solriamfetol, 6.5 h), with clinically insignificant median decreases of 12 and 23 min in both the solriamfetol and placebo groups, respectively, from baseline to week 12, and median nightly use of ≥ 6 h for all solriamfetol dose groups for all periods. The placebo and intervention data are similar to those reported in trials of modafinil and armodafinil, which also enrolled pathologically sleepy individuals with OSA treated with PAP, and collectively suggest that improvement in alertness with a medication like solriamfetol does not negatively affect adherence to primary OSA therapy, such as CPAP.

The adherent and nonadherent subgroups' incidences of AEs and discontinuations because of AEs were higher with solriamfetol than with placebo and generally were dose dependent. AEs typically were mild to moderate in intensity, and the most common AEs between the subgroups included headache, nausea, anxiety, decreased appetite, nasopharyngitis, and diarrhea.

Treatment of EDS is an important element of OSA management because EDS is associated with cognitive impairments, impaired quality of life, and a risk for accidents and may persist in a substantial number of patients despite effective treatment of the underlying airway obstruction. For these patients, a thorough evaluation of factors that may contribute to sleepiness is required, such as depression, use of sedating medications, insufficient sleep, and other sleep disorders. For patients nonadherent with PAP treatment, evaluation of optimal pressure, mask interface, and patient-reported symptoms is essential. Behavioral therapies and educational strategies hold promise for improving adherence, but comparative-effectiveness studies are needed to translate these methods into routine care. Despite efforts to optimize adherence and treat other causes of EDS, some patients remain sleepy and may benefit from wake-promoting drugs, provided these drugs are not used as a substitute for primary OSA treatment. Indeed, data from this study underscore the benefit of primary OSA therapy in the treatment of EDS, because a greater proportion of solriamfetol-treated participants who were adherent to primary OSA therapy achieved normal values on measures of EDS relative to participants nonadherent to primary OSA therapy.

### A randomized study of solriamfetol for excessive sleepiness in narcolepsy [^6af0ffef]. Annals of Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This phase 3 study demonstrated the robust effects of solriamfetol for improving wakefulness on the MWT and reducing ES on the ESS in a large population of patients with narcolepsy. This study also supports the safety and tolerability profile of solriamfetol. Solriamfetol demonstrated dose‐dependent efficacy that was significantly superior to placebo on both coprimary endpoints at the 150 and 300 mg doses. The 75 mg dose resulted in significantly greater improvement than placebo on the ESS but not on the MWT.

Importantly, improvements on both coprimary endpoints were observed at week 1, and these effects were maintained at the 150 and 300 mg doses over the study duration, indicating that there was no apparent tolerance over the 12 weeks of the study. Onset of efficacy at week 1 is consistent with what was observed previously in individuals with narcolepsy. 18 Furthermore, on the MWT, significant effects were observed across all 5 of the individual MWT trials at the 150 and 300 mg doses, effects that were maintained over a 9‐hour duration following dosing at the 12‐week time point. This effect across the day may be longer in duration than what was observed in prior studies of the wake‐promoting agents armodafinil and modafinil in patients with narcolepsy, where the effect appeared to diminish during the 4th and 5th time trials later in the day. 27, 28 However, definitive conclusions cannot be drawn in the absence of comparative trials.

Outcomes

Coprimary end points were change from baseline to week 12 in MWTmean sleep latency (as determined from the first four of five trials of a 40-min MWT) and ESSscore. The key secondary end point was the percentage of participants reporting improvement on the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGI-C)at week 12. An additional secondary end point was change from baseline to week 12 on the Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire short version (FOSQ-10) total score. Assessments also were conducted at weeks 1 and 4 for MWT and at weeks 1, 4, and 8 for ESS, FOSQ-10, and PGI-C, but are not reported here.

Safety and tolerability assessments included monitoring of AEs and vital signs at each study visit. At baseline and weeks 1, 4, and 12, vital signs, including heart rate, systolic BP, and diastolic BP, were obtained at seven time points during the day from before dosing to approximately 9 h after dosing.

For participants using devices as primary OSA therapy (at any level of adherence), use during the study was recorded by electronic download (when available) or by diary. The following variables were summarized by analysis periods (baseline, defined as the period between screening and baseline visits [≤ 29 days]; weeks 1–4; weeks 5–8; and weeks 9–12): number of hours per night that participants used the device (from devices with electronically retrievable data), percentage of nights that participants reported use for more than half of the night (from diary data for those without electronically retrievable data), and percentage of nights that participants used the device (from electronically retrievable and diary data).

### A randomized study of solriamfetol for excessive sleepiness in narcolepsy [^d140c767]. Annals of Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Improvements were observed at all solriamfetol doses at week 1 on the MWT (see Fig 2 A). The magnitude of effect remained stable over the 12 weeks of the study, and the 300 and 150 mg doses differed from placebo at weeks 1 and 4. Similar patterns were observed on the ESS (see Fig 2 B), with reductions in ESS score relative to placebo observed as early as week 1 with the 300 and 150 mg doses, and effects remained stable over the study duration.

Evaluation of mean sleep latency on each of the 5 individual MWT trials at week 12 showed efficacy beginning at 1 hour after dosing through 9 hours after dosing for solriamfetol 150 and 300 mg (Fig 3).

Solriamfetol increased the percentage of patients who reported improvement in their overall condition on the PGI‐C (Fig 4 A). At week 12, these increases were dose‐dependent and were significant for solriamfetol 300 mg (84.7%) and 150 mg (78.2%) doses versus placebo (39.7%; both p < 0.0001); the 75 mg dose was nominally significant (67.8%) compared with placebo (p = 0.0023, but the comparison was below the hierarchical break). Effects were observed at all doses by week 1 and remained stable over the course of the study.

### A randomized study of solriamfetol for excessive sleepiness in narcolepsy [^4581cff9]. Annals of Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Efficacy

Solriamfetol 300 mg and 150 mg doses met the coprimary endpoints of MWT and ESS as well as the percentage of patients who reported improvement on the PGI‐C (all p < 0.0001; Table 2). Significance was not achieved for solriamfetol 75 mg on the MWT.

Table 2
Hierarchical Testing of Coprimary and Key Secondary Efficacy Endpoints in the Modified Intention‐to‐Treat Population

The LS mean change from baseline at week 12 on the MWT showed an increase in mean sleep latency of 12.3 (SE = 1.4) and 9.8 (SE = 1.3) minutes with solriamfetol 300 mg and 150 mg, respectively, which was significant compared with 2.1 (SE = 1.3) minutes for placebo (both p < 0.0001; Fig 2 A). These changes resulted in LS mean differences versus placebo of 10.1 (95% CI = 6.4–13.9) minutes for solriamfetol 300 mg and 7.7 (95% CI = 4.0–11.3) minutes for solriamfetol 150 mg. Although the LS mean increase in sleep latency of 4.7 (SE = 1.3) minutes at the 75 mg dose was approximately 2‐fold higher than that of placebo, significance was not met (p = 0.1595).

### A randomized study of solriamfetol for excessive sleepiness in narcolepsy [^d2515fd4]. Annals of Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

Solriamfetol (JZP‐110) is a selective dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor with wake‐promoting effects. This phase 3 study (NCT02348593) evaluated the safety and efficacy of solriamfetol in narcolepsy.

Methods

Patients with narcolepsy with mean sleep latency < 25 minutes on the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) score ≥ 10, and usual nightly sleep ≥ 6 hours were randomized to solriamfetol 75, 150, or 300 mg, or placebo for 12 weeks. Coprimary endpoints were change from baseline to week 12 in MWT and ESS. Improvement on the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGI‐C) was the key secondary endpoint.

Results

Safety and modified intention‐to‐treat populations included 236 and 231 patients, respectively. Solriamfetol 300 and 150 mg were positive on both coprimary endpoints. Least squares mean (standard error [SE]) changes from baseline were 12.3 (SE = 1.4) and 9.8 (SE = 1.3) minutes for solriamfetol 300 and 150 mg on the MWT, respectively, versus 2.1 (SE = 1.3) minutes for placebo, and −6.4 (SE = 0.7) for 300 mg and −5.4 (SE = 0.7) for 150 mg on the ESS versus −1.6 (SE = 0.7) for placebo (all p < 0.0001). At week 12, higher percentages of patients treated with solriamfetol 150 mg (78.2%) and 300 mg (84.7%) reported PGI‐C improvement relative to placebo (39.7%; both p < 0.0001). Adverse events ≥ 5% across all solriamfetol doses included headache (21.5%), nausea (10.7%), decreased appetite (10.7%), nasopharyngitis (9.0%), dry mouth (7.3%), and anxiety (5.1%).

Interpretation

### Long-term effects of solriamfetol on quality of life and work productivity in participants with excessive daytime sleepiness associated with narcolepsy or obstructive sleep apnea [^448fd354]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Study Objectives

Solriamfetol, a dopamine/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, is approved in the United States and European Union for excessive daytime sleepiness in adults with narcolepsy (75–150 mg/day) or obstructive sleep apnea (OSA; 37.5–150 mg/day). In 12-week studies, solriamfetol was associated with improvements in quality of life in participants with narcolepsy or OSA. These analyses evaluated the long-term effects of solriamfetol on quality of life.

Methods

Participants with narcolepsy or OSA who completed previous solriamfetol studies were eligible. A 2-week titration was followed by a maintenance phase ≤ 50 weeks (stable doses: 75, 150, or 300 mg/day). Quality of life assessments included Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire short version, Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire: Specific Health Problem, and 36-Item Short Form Health Survey version 2. Mean (standard deviation) changes from baseline to end of study were evaluated. Data were summarized descriptively. Adverse events were assessed.

Results

Safety population comprised 643 participants (417 OSA, 226 narcolepsy). Solriamfetol improved Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire short version Total scores (mean change [standard deviation], 3.7 [3.0]) and 36-Item Short Form Health Survey version 2 Physical and Mental Component Summary scores (3.1 [6.9] and 4.3 [8.4], respectively); improvements were sustained throughout treatment. On Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire: Specific Health Problem, solriamfetol reduced (improved) % presenteeism, % overall work impairment, and % activity impairment by a minimum of 25%. Common adverse events (≥ 5%): headache, nausea, nasopharyngitis, insomnia, dry mouth, anxiety, decreased appetite, and upper respiratory tract infection.

Conclusions

Long-term solriamfetol treatment was associated with clinically meaningful, sustained improvements in functional status, work productivity, and quality of life for up to 52 weeks. Adverse events were similar between narcolepsy and OSA.

### Solriamfetol for excessive sleepiness in narcolepsy and obstructive sleep apnea [^32666a12]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this article is to review the available clinical trial data that led to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of solriamfetol as well as its role in clinical practice.

Data Sources

A MEDLINE/PubMed search was conducted (January 2000 to February 2020) using the keyword solriamfetol to discover appropriate clinical trials.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Articles were included that were published in the English language and related to the FDA approval of solriamfetol or provided novel information regarding this drug entity.

Data Synthesis

The findings of the review show that solriamfetol may be a safe and effective option for the treatment of excessive sleepiness (ES) related to narcolepsy and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).

Relevance To Patient Care and Clinical Practice

Solriamfetol is distinguished from other stimulants in that it has lower binding affinity to dopamine and norepinephrine transporters and does not have the monoamine-releasing effects of amphetamines at usual therapeutic doses. Because of solriamfetol's unique mechanism of action, there may be a reduction in abuse potential compared with the other currently FDA-approved options.

Conclusions

In clinical trials, solriamfetol has shown dose-dependent improvement in wakefulness over placebo and adds another option for clinicians when treating ES in narcolepsy and OSA.

### Treat the symptom, not the cause? Pitolisant for sleepiness in obstructive sleep apnea [^fddacb61]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

There is also a question regarding the clinical importance of this statistically significant benefit. Despite widespread use of the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) in clinical trials and clinical practice, there is still uncertainty about how much the ESS scores must change to represent a meaningful improvement. Dauvilliers and colleagues prespecified a minimal important difference of 3 points. The observed benefit of pitolisant was a modest 2.8 points and thus did not meet this threshold, raising the possibility that the average benefit of pitolisant for OSA is not meaningful. However, it can be challenging to determine minimal important differences, and other work has suggested that the minimal important difference in ESS for patients with OSA falls between 2 and 3 points. Studies assessing other pharmacologic treatments of OSA sleepiness have shown similar reductions in ESS compared with placebo (1.7–4.5 points more than placebo with solriamfetol, 3.0 points more with modafinil, and 2.8 points more with armodafinil), although some patients in these studies were also treated with CPAP, potentially creating a treatment ceiling effect. Supporting the argument that pitolisant's effect may be clinically significant, Dauvilliers and colleagues found improvements in several subjective secondary outcomes, including fatigue and patient and clinical global impressions.

What about objective measures of sleepiness? In Dauvilliers and colleagues' study, the Oxford Sleep Resistance Test was the only objective measure of sleepiness, and scores were not significantly improved with pitolisant. Similarly, objective cognitive performance was not improved. This differs from the use of pitolisant in narcolepsy, which was shown to result in a modest improvement of 1.5 minutes on the maintenance of wakefulness test. The absence of an objective benefit does not necessarily imply that pitolisant is ineffective for OSA sleepiness, because objective and subjective tests measure different aspects of the construct of sleepiness. However, objective tests such as the maintenance of wakefulness test may better predict important outcomes, such as driving safety. It is possible, but speculative, that sleepiness-related safety concerns may remain even after subjective sleepiness improves in patients with OSA treated with pitolisant, which would have important implications for decisions about whether or not to use this treatment strategy.

### Solriamfetol for excessive daytime sleepiness in Parkinson's disease: phase 2 proof-of-concept trial [^c050559d]. Movement Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Solriamfetol is approved (US and EU) for excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) in narcolepsy and obstructive sleep apnea.

Objectives

Evaluate solriamfetol safety/efficacy for EDS in Parkinson's disease (PD).

Methods

Phase 2, double‐blind, 4‐week, crossover trial: adults with PD and EDS were randomized to sequence A (placebo, solriamfetol 75, 150, 300 mg/d), B (solriamfetol 75, 150, 300 mg/d, placebo), or C (placebo). Outcomes (safety/tolerability [primary]; Epworth Sleepiness Scale [ESS]; Maintenance of Wakefulness Test [MWT]) were assessed weekly. P values are nominal.

Results

Common adverse events (n = 66): nausea (10.7%), dizziness (7.1%), dry mouth (7.1%), headache (7.1%), anxiety (5.4%), constipation (5.4%), dyspepsia (5.4%). ESS decreased both placebo (−4.78) and solriamfetol (−4.82 to −5.72; P > 0.05). MWT improved dose‐dependently with solriamfetol, increasing by 5.05 minutes with 300 mg relative to placebo (P = 0.0098).

Conclusions

Safety/tolerability was consistent with solriamfetol's known profile. There were no significant improvements on ESS; MWT results suggest possible benefit with solriamfetol in PD. © 2021 The Authors.

### A randomized study of solriamfetol for excessive sleepiness in narcolepsy [^506063f4]. Annals of Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

The increased wakefulness and reduced ES observed with solriamfetol 150 and 300 mg paralleled global improvements assessed from both the patients' and clinicians' perspectives.

The overall safety and tolerability in this study were consistent with other studies of solriamfetol, 17, 18 with the most common adverse events being headache, nausea, decreased appetite, nasopharyngitis, dry mouth, and anxiety; no serious adverse events were reported. Additionally, small increases in mean blood pressure and heart rate were observed, as previously reported with other wake‐promoting agents and psychostimulants. 39

Conclusions with regard to the effect of solriamfetol on cataplexy are limited by this study not being designed to rigorously evaluate effects on cataplexy. The frequency of type 2 narcolepsy (ie, without cataplexy) in approximately 50% of the study population was also somewhat higher than reported in the narcolepsy literature. 10 Whether the observed effects on efficacy in this study can be maintained without safety and tolerability concerns during long‐term treatment has been conducted, and results are currently under review.

In conclusion, once‐daily oral dosing of solriamfetol 150 and 300 mg resulted in major improvements in wakefulness and reductions in ES associated with narcolepsy together with patient‐ and clinician‐reported global improvements. The safety profile was consistent with other clinical studies of solriamfetol in narcolepsy. These results demonstrate that solriamfetol represents an important potential future therapeutic option for the treatment of impaired wakefulness and ES in individuals with narcolepsy.

### A randomized study of solriamfetol for excessive sleepiness in narcolepsy [^243a09fa]. Annals of Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Treatment of narcolepsy is symptomatically driven, and management of ES generally relies on pharmacologic intervention from several medication classes including the central nervous system depressant sodium oxybate, stimulants such as methylphenidate and amphetamines, and the wake‐promoting agents modafinil and armodafinil. 2, 11 Additionally, the wake‐promoting agent pitolisant has been recently approved for the treatment of narcolepsy in Europe. 12 However, current pharmacologic options may be associated with factors such as poor tolerability, tolerance over time, abuse potential, and suboptimal response that may preclude or limit their use in some patients. 2, 11

Solriamfetol (formerly known as JZP‐110 and ADX‐N05) is a selective dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor that binds to dopamine and norepinephrine transporters in vitro at concentrations in the micromolar range, inhibiting reuptake without promoting the release of monoamines. 13 Solriamfetol is distinguished from other wake‐promoting agents by its dual reuptake inhibition at dopamine and norepinephrine transporters, and is distinguished from the amphetamine stimulants by its lack of release of monoamines. 14, 15 Together, these differences may account for the robust wake‐promoting effects and the lack of rebound hypersomnia that have been observed in rodent models of narcolepsy. 13, 16 In 2 phase 2 controlled clinical trials in adult patients with narcolepsy, solriamfetol reduced patient‐reported ES as measured on the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and improved wakefulness as measured by the objective Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT). 17, 18

This phase 3 trial was initiated to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of solriamfetol for the treatment of ES and impaired wakefulness in patients with narcolepsy type 1 or type 2.

### Solriamfetol for excessive daytime sleepiness in Parkinson's disease: phase 2 proof-of-concept trial [^6b6fb057]. Movement Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

Improvement on ESS was greater among those taking dopamine agonists, while improvement on MWT was greater among those not taking these agents. Although use of dopamine agonists is associated with subjective sleepiness, it is difficult to speculate about the reasons for these apparent differences. These findings illustrate the challenge of using outcome measures that only weakly to moderately correlate.

Other agents have been evaluated in PD patients with EDS in studies with varying designs and methodologies that, generally, included small sample sizes; larger trials are warranted. Modafinil improved ESS scores in some, but not all, studies; a meta‐analysis found an overall treatment effect of −2.24 (95% CI −3.90 to −0.57) for modafinil versus placebo. Modafinil has not demonstrated improvements on MWT 12 or mean sleep latency test [MSLT]. Sodium oxybate significantly improved ESS scores (−4.2 vs. placebo) and MSLT sleep latency (+2.9 minutes vs. placebo), but has been associated with small, though significant, increases in apneic events. Atomoxetine significantly improved ESS scores (−2.9 vs. placebo) in patients with PD and depression. Finally, caffeine showed minimal improvement on ESS (mean difference −1.71); findings were not significant.

### Randomized controlled trial of solriamfetol for excessive daytime sleepiness in OSA: an analysis of subgroups adherent or nonadherent to OSA treatment [^072859d4]. Chest (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Solriamfetol, a dopamine-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, is approved in the United States to improve wakefulness in adults with excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) associated with OSA (37.5–150 mg/d).

Research Question

Does solriamfetol have differential effects on EDS based on adherence to primary OSA therapy and does solriamfetol affect primary OSA therapy use?

Study Design and Methods

Participants were randomized to 12 weeks of placebo or solriamfetol 37.5, 75, 150, or 300 mg/d (stratified by primary OSA therapy adherence). Coprimary end points were week 12 change from baseline in 40-min Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT) and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) in the modified intention-to-treat population. Primary OSA therapy use (hours per night, % nights) and safety were evaluated.

Results

At baseline, 324 participants (70.6%) adhered to OSA therapy (positive airway pressure use ≥ 4 h/night on ≥ 70% nights, surgical intervention, or oral appliance use on ≥ 70% nights) and 135 participants (29.4%) did not adhere. Least squares (LS) mean differences from placebo in MWT sleep latency (minutes) in the 37.5-, 75-, 150-, and 300-mg/d groups among adherent participants were 4.8 (95% CI, 0.6–9.0), 8.4 (95% CI, 4.3–12.5), 10.2 (95% CI, 6.8–13.6), and 12.5 (95% CI, 9.0–15.9) and among nonadherent participants were 3.7 (95% CI, –2.0 to 9.4), 9.9 (95% CI, 4.4–15.4), 11.9 (95% CI, 7.5–16.3), and 13.5 (95% CI, 8.8–18.3). On ESS, LS mean differences from placebo in the 37.5-, 75-, 150-, and 300-mg/d groups among adherent participants were –2.4 (95% CI, –4.2 to –0.5), –1.3 (95% CI, –3.1 to 0.5), –4.2 (95% CI, –5.7 to –2.7), and –4.7 (95% CI, –6.1 to –3.2) and among nonadherent participants were –0.7 (95% CI, –3.5 to 2.1), –2.6 (95% CI, –5.4 to 0.1), –5.0 (95% CI, –7.2 to –2.9), and –4.6 (95% CI, –7.0 to –2.3). Common adverse events included headache, nausea, anxiety, decreased appetite, nasopharyngitis, and diarrhea. No clinically meaningful changes were seen in primary OSA therapy use with solriamfetol.

Interpretation

Solriamfetol improved EDS in OSA regardless of primary OSA therapy adherence. Primary OSA therapy use was unaffected with solriamfetol.

### Solriamfetol (Sunosi) [^b8d5867d]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

14.1 Narcolepsy

The efficacy of SUNOSI in improving wakefulness and reducing excessive daytime sleepiness was demonstrated in a 12-week, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study (Study 1; NCT02348593) in adult patients with a diagnosis of narcolepsy according to the ICSD-3 or DSM-5 criteria.

Wakefulness and sleepiness were assessed using the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT) and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). The MWT measures an individual's ability to remain awake during the daytime in a darkened, quiet environment. Patients were instructed to remain awake for as long as possible during 40-minute test sessions, and sleep latency was determined as the mean number of minutes patients could remain awake in the first four test sessions. The ESS is an 8-item questionnaire by which patients rate their perceived likelihood of falling asleep during usual daily life activities. Change in overall symptom severity was assessed using the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIc) scale. The PGIc is a 7-point patient-reported scale by which patients rate their symptom change since the beginning of the study. Responses range from "very much improved" to "very much worse". The co-primary efficacy endpoints were change from baseline in MWT and ESS at Week 12. A pre-specified secondary endpoint was percentage of subjects reported as improved (minimally, much, or very much) at Week 12 by PGIc.

### Clinically relevant effects of solriamfetol on excessive daytime sleepiness: a posthoc analysis of the magnitude of change in clinical trials in adults with narcolepsy or obstructive sleep apnea [^eb77079d]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Study Objectives

To evaluate the clinical relevance of solriamfetol in treating excessive daytime sleepiness in participants with narcolepsy or obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).

Methods

This posthoc analysis includes data from two 12-week, randomized phase 3 studies in participants with narcolepsy or OSA treated with once-daily placebo or solriamfetol 37.5 mg (OSA only), 75 mg, 150 mg, or 300 mg. Excessive daytime sleepiness was assessed with the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) at baseline and at week 12. Cumulative distribution function plots were generated using a last-observation-carried-forward approach to determine the percentage of participants who achieved ESS scores ≤ 10, within the normal range, and the percentage who achieved a reduction (improvement) in ESS ≥ 25% relative to baseline. Safety was also assessed.

Results

In narcolepsy (n = 231), 30.5%-49.2% of participants treated with solriamfetol (across doses) reported ESS scores ≤ 10 and 44.1%-62.7% achieved a ≥ 25% decrease from baseline in ESS scores at week 12, compared with 15.5% and 27.6%, respectively, of placebo recipients. In OSA (n = 459), 51.8%-73.0% of participants treated with solriamfetol (across doses) reported ESS scores ≤ 10 and 50.0%-81.9% achieved a ≥ 25% decrease from baseline in ESS scores at week 12, compared with 37.7% and 36.8%, respectively, of placebo recipients. Results were generally dose-dependent, with more responders at higher solriamfetol doses. Common treatment-emergent adverse events (≥ 5% of solriamfetol recipients in either study) were headache, nausea, decreased appetite, nasopharyngitis, dry mouth, and anxiety.

Conclusions

A greater percentage of participants treated with solriamfetol achieved normal ESS scores (≤ 10) or clinically meaningful improvements on the ESS compared with those receiving placebo. The safety profile was similar between participants with narcolepsy and those with OSA.

### Is more always better? Dose effect in a multidomain intervention in older adults at risk of dementia [^3bc495ff]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2022). Medium credibility.

Dose is a critical factor examined in pharmacological treatments, but little is known about dose effects for non‐pharmacological multidomain interventions, as well as the optimal dose or the mathematical function that relates dose to improvement. Determining the optimal dose is critical because multidomain interventions are complex to deliver and demanding for the participant. Interventions must be available in the person's community and involves commitment and motivation. A dose that is too high increases costs and may have a detrimental effect on participant motivation. In turn, administering a sub‐optimal dose is problematic for obvious reasons. Thus identifying how dose optimizes efficacy may impact the design of large prevention trials, and inform public recommendations and prevention programs that target at‐risk populations.

Response to training is likely to vary with the dose delivered; however, because few data exist, it is critical to determine the effect of dose on the efficacy of multidomain interventions or on other non‐pharmacological interventions. Most assume that a linear function typically describes the dose‐response relationship in non‐pharmacological interventions, where additional dose linearly increases the effect and larger doses are best. However, the relationship between dose and response is probably more complex. For instance, in a meta‐analysis of computerized training in older adults, Lampit et al.reported an inverse U‐shaped parabolic function, where increasing the number of weekly sessions improved efficacy up to a certain point, after which an increased number of sessions became detrimental. In the Advanced Cognitive Training for Independent and Vital Elderly (ACTIVE) study, Edwards et al.reported that the number of attentional training sessions attended was related linearly to the progression of dementia, but there was no dose effect for reasoning or memory when adjusting for risk factors. The study did not assess non‐linear models.

### Solriamfetol for excessive daytime sleepiness in Parkinson's disease: phase 2 proof-of-concept trial [^61128421]. Movement Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Solriamfetol is approved (US and EU) for excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) in narcolepsy and obstructive sleep apnea.

Objectives

Evaluate solriamfetol safety/efficacy for EDS in Parkinson's disease (PD).

Methods

Phase 2, double-blind, 4-week, crossover trial: adults with PD and EDS were randomized to sequence A (placebo, solriamfetol 75, 150, 300mg/d), B (solriamfetol 75, 150, 300mg/d, placebo), or C (placebo). Outcomes (safety/tolerability [primary]; Epworth Sleepiness Scale [ESS]; Maintenance of Wakefulness Test [MWT]) were assessed weekly. P values are nominal.

Results

Common adverse events (n = 66): nausea (10.7%), dizziness (7.1%), dry mouth (7.1%), headache (7.1%), anxiety (5.4%), constipation (5.4%), dyspepsia (5.4%). ESS decreased both placebo (-4.78) and solriamfetol (-4.82 to -5.72; P > 0.05). MWT improved dose-dependently with solriamfetol, increasing by 5.05minutes with 300mg relative to placebo (P = 0.0098).

Conclusions

Safety/tolerability was consistent with solriamfetol's known profile. There were no significant improvements on ESS; MWT results suggest possible benefit with solriamfetol in PD. © 2021 The Authors.

### Randomized controlled trial of solriamfetol for excessive daytime sleepiness in OSA: an analysis of subgroups adherent or nonadherent to OSA treatment [^d659c608]. Chest (2021). Medium credibility.

Solriamfetol, a dopamine-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to improve wakefulness in adults with EDS associated with OSA (37.5–150 mg/d) or narcolepsy (75–150 mg/d); a positive opinion from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use was received recommending European Medicines Agency approval for the same indications. Solriamfetol demonstrated robust wake-promoting effects in a dose-dependent fashion in sleepy patients with OSA in a phase III study. Unlike previous trials of wake-promoting agents that included only patients who were currently using CPAP at a specified level of adherence, the phase III study of solriamfetol enrolled participants with current or prior use of primary airway therapy (eg, CPAP, oral appliance), including participants who showed suboptimal adherence to such therapy, to study a population more representative of patients with OSA in clinical practice. Only individuals who had declined to try a primary OSA therapy were excluded from the study. It was recognized that adherence level may impact efficacy; therefore, participants were stratified by adherence or nonadherence before randomization, and the randomization stratification factor was included in the statistical model as a fixed effect for the coprimary efficacy end points (Maintenance of Wakefulness Test [MWT] and Epworth Sleepiness Scale [ESS]). The randomization stratification factor was not significant for the MWT or the ESS, suggesting that baseline adherence to primary OSA therapy was not a significant predictor of outcome regarding the primary end points.

14.2 Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA)

The efficacy of SUNOSI in improving wakefulness and reducing excessive daytime sleepiness in patients with OSA was demonstrated in a 12-week multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (Study 2; NCT02348606) in adults diagnosed with OSA according to ICSD-3 criteria. The co-primary efficacy endpoints were change from baseline in MWT and ESS at Week 12; a pre-specified secondary endpoint was percentage of subjects reported as improved (minimally, much, or very much) at Week 12 by PGIc.

A total of 476 patients with OSA were randomized to receive SUNOSI 37.5 mg, 75 mg, 150 mg, or 300 mg (two times the maximum recommended daily dose), or placebo once daily. Patients randomized to the 150-mg dose received 75 mg for the first 3 days before increasing to 150 mg.

Demographic and baseline disease characteristics were similar for the SUNOSI and placebo groups. Median age was 55 years (range 20 to 75 years), 37% were female, 76% were Caucasian, 19% were African American, and 4% were Asian.

Compared to the placebo group, patients randomized to 37.5 mg, 75 mg, and 150 mg SUNOSI showed statistically significant improvements on the MWT (treatment effect difference: 4.5 minutes, 8.9 minutes, and 10.7 minutes respectively; Table 6) and ESS (treatment effect difference: 1.9 points, 1.7 points, and 4.5 points respectively; Table 7) at Week 12. These effects were apparent at Week 1 and consistent with the results at Week 12. The change on percentage of subjects reported as improved by PGIc was also statistically significant compared with placebo at the 75 mg and 150 mg doses. Examination of subgroups by age, race, and sex did not suggest differences in response.

### Solriamfetol improves daily fatigue symptoms in adults with myalgic encephalomyelitis / chronic fatigue syndrome after 8 weeks of treatment [^3191dea6]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a long-term illness with no treatment options that address the disease directly. Solriamfetol is a selective dual norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor that promotes wakefulness in obstructive sleep apnea and narcolepsy.

Aims

This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of solriamfetol for fatigue symptoms in adults with ME/CFS over 8weeks of treatment.

Methods

This was a phase 4, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of solriamfetol in adults with ME/CFS. Eligible participants (N = 38) were randomly assigned to receive 75mg (titrated to 150mg as needed) solriamfetol or placebo. Participants completed a battery of assessments at weekly visits. The primary outcome was Fatigue Symptom Inventory (FSI) scores, and the secondary outcome measure was Behavioral Rating Inventory of Executive Function for Adults (BRIEF-A), at Weeks 6 and 8. T-tests assessed the differences in mean change from baseline between solriamfetol and placebo. Adverse events were monitored throughout the study.

Results

At Week 8 (p = 0.039), but not Week 6 (p = 0.270), solriamfetol improved FSI severity compared to placebo. On the BRIEF-A global executive composite, solriamfetol improved more than placebo at Week 8 (p = 0.012), driven by improved metacognition index (p = 0.004), but not behavioral regulation index (p = 0.574). Solriamfetol was well tolerated, with most common AEs being sleep loss and headaches.

Conclusions

Solriamfetol demonstrated good safety and efficacy in improving fatigue and executive functioning in patients with ME/CFS. As a dual norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor and wakefulness-promoting factors, solriamfetol has the potential to improve fatigue symptoms of ME/CFS.

### Expectations regarding cognitive enhancement create substantial challenges [^7dcbc75e]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2009). Low credibility.

A recent discussion on cognitive enhancers has caused some controversy in the ethics and neuroscience fields by coming out in favour of making neuropharmaceuticals with enhancing properties available for general consumption. We highlight in this brief commentary why concerns regarding efficacy and safety, demands on resources, and public health are substantive enough to warrant serious reconsideration before pharmaceutical performance enhancement can be widely supported.

### Comparative efficacy, safety and benefit / risk of alerting agents for excessive daytime sleepiness in patients with obstructive sleep apnoea: a network meta-analysis [^2802d923]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Limitations of this study include the lack of consistent outcomes for patients with OSA. Consequently, we used a composite endpoint of mean Z-scores for subjective and objective outcomes which may limit interpretability for clinicians. Setting the effect size to 0.2, indicating a small clinically meaningful improvement in efficacy, is arbitrary and should not be interpreted rigidly. As there is a lack of connectivity of our network, assumptions regarding transitivity and coherence are difficult to assess. The clinical characteristics of most participants in the selected RCTs limit the generalizability of the results: approximately 70% were men, were mainly white and were receiving conventional therapy. Furthermore, patient inclusion criteria were variable e.g. baseline ESS varied from ≥ 10 to ≥ 12, and adherence/non-adherence to CPAP therapy. Most trials were conducted in high-income countries in Europe, Japan, the USA or Australia, and the most common trial duration was 12 weeks (9/20 RCTs) with others conducted from 2 to 6 weeks. Study design of selected trials differed: most had a parallel group design but three crossover RCTs were included, and trials differed in fixed versus escalating dose of investigational product. Efficacy for solriamfetol was based on a single RCT, and trials of both modafinil and armodafinil were included with dosages of armodafinil converted to `modafinil-equivalent doses based on a head-to-head clinical trial. The latter approach (combining modafinil and armodafinil data) did not result in any significant changes to the results of our analysis compared with a repeated analysis of the two drugs separately for the main endpoints (ESS, MWT and Z-scores; data not shown). The objective assessment of EDS was carried out with the OSLER for both pitolisant RCTs, whereas MWT was the preferred instrument tool for modafinil and solriamfetol trials (the co-primary endpoints in the solriamfetol RCT were ESS and MWT, whereas the primary endpoint in pitolisant RCTs was ESS, and OSLER was a secondary outcome). Using the standardized mean difference allowed us to avoid the expected heterogeneity on the mean and standard deviation of the two measures, and the choice of a random meta-analytical model attempted to capture an induced possible study effect. Analysis of different instruments for QoL may have contributed to the high degree of heterogeneity between studies. Furthermore, all the trials did not include patients with severe chronic diseases other than OSA, especially comorbid cardiovascular disease, which limits the interpretation of safety data. Details of BP assessment were not supplied in all publications, but office BP was measured in all publications providing detailed methods. Benefit-risk was based on a compensatory model for efficacy and safety but is open to challenge with ponderation. However, a repeated analysis based on the ratio (data not shown) provided evidence of the same order of benefit-risk, showing that there was no difference between the treatments but the same order of benefit-risk.

### A randomized study of solriamfetol for excessive sleepiness in narcolepsy [^23eef268]. Annals of Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Statistical Analyses

Accounting for withdrawals, approximately 240 patients were planned for enrollment, approximately 60 for each treatment group. This sample size was based on an estimate of 54 patients per group to provide at least 80% power to detect a difference of 6 minutes in the mean sleep latency time as determined from the MWT (mean of the first 4 trials) and a difference of 4 points on the ESS changes from baseline to week 12 between each solriamfetol treatment dose group and placebo. These estimates were based on the effects observed at the 150 and 300 mg doses in 2 phase 2 studies. 17, 18 This calculation also assumed standard deviations (SDs) in the changes from baseline of 10 minutes for the MWT and 6 points for the ESS, and a 2‐sided significance level of 0.05 using a t test.

Efficacy analyses were based on the modified intention‐to‐treat (mITT) population, defined as all randomized patients who received at least 1 dose of study drug, and had baseline and at least 1 postbaseline evaluation by MWT or ESS. Both MWT and ESS endpoints were analyzed using a mixed‐effect repeated measures model, including fixed effects for treatment (ie, dose group), visit (as a discrete and repeated factor), treatment‐by‐visit interaction, baseline value of the corresponding endpoint (as a continuous covariate), and randomization stratification factor (ie, presence or absence of cataplexy). The response variable was the change from baseline to each postbaseline visit, and the coprimary endpoints were the changes from baseline to week 12. The least squares (LS) mean and the standard error (SE) of treatment difference versus placebo and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were presented. The PGI‐C and CGI‐C were analyzed using chi‐squared tests. A fixed hierarchical testing procedure was used to correct for multiplicity, starting with the highest solriamfetol dose for the coprimary endpoints and followed by the key secondary endpoint. Both coprimary endpoints (MWT and ESS) had to be significant at the 0.05 level in the primary analysis for testing to proceed to the key secondary endpoint (PGI‐C); testing proceeded in the order specified above for each subsequent lower dose with statistical significance claimed only for those outcomes above the break in the hierarchy. Nominal p values are presented for differences below the hierarchical break.

### Solriamfetol for the treatment of excessive sleepiness in OSA: a placebo-controlled randomized withdrawal study [^1c52657f]. Chest (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Excessive sleepiness (ES) is a common symptom of OSA, which often persists despite primary OSA therapy. This phase III randomized withdrawal trial evaluated solriamfetol (JZP-110) for the treatment of ES in adults with OSA.

Methods

After 2 weeks of clinical titration (n = 174) and 2 weeks of stable dose administration (n = 148), participants who reported improvement on the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGI-C) and had numerical improvements on the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT) and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) were randomly assigned to placebo (n = 62) or solriamfetol (n = 62) for 2 additional weeks. Coprimary end points were change from weeks 4 to 6 in MWT and ESS.

Results

In the modified intention-to-treat population (n = 122), MWT mean sleep latencies and ESS scores improved from baseline to week 4 (from 12.3–13.1 to 29.0–31.7 minutes and from 15.3–16.0 to 5.9–6.4, respectively). From weeks 4 to 6, participants treated with solriamfetol maintained improvements (least squares [LS] mean [SE] changes of -1.0 [1.4] minutes on MWT and -0.1 [0.7] on ESS), whereas participants treated with placebo worsened (LS mean [SE] change of -12.1 [1.3] minutes on MWT and 4.5 [0.7] on ESS); LS mean differences between treatments were 11.2 minutes (95% CI, 7.8–14.6) and -4.6 (95% CI, -6.4 to -2.8) on MWT and ESS, respectively. Fewer participants treated with solriamfetol reported worsening on the PGI-C from weeks 4 to 6 (20% vs 50%; P = 0.0005). Common adverse events included headache, dry mouth, nausea, dizziness, and insomnia.

Conclusions

This study demonstrated maintenance of solriamfetol efficacy and safety over 6 weeks.

### Randomized controlled trial of solriamfetol for excessive daytime sleepiness in OSA: an analysis of subgroups adherent or nonadherent to OSA treatment [^05ea0494]. Chest (2021). Medium credibility.

Efficacy of Solriamfetol by Adherence Subgroup

The overall pattern of changes from baseline to week 12 in MWT sleep latency and ESS scores was consistent between subgroups defined by adherence to primary OSA therapy at baseline. In both subgroups, solriamfetol increased MWT sleep latency in a dose-dependent manner relative to placebo (Fig 2). Likewise, solriamfetol treatment was associated with dose-dependent decreases in ESS score relative to placebo in both the adherent and nonadherent subgroups (Fig 3). An alternative model that included the treatment by adherence interaction term was run for the coprimary end points (MWT and ESS). The interaction term was not significant when comparing solriamfetol (combined doses) with placebo for either the MWT (P = 0.32) or ESS (P = 0.97), indicating no significant interaction occurred between adherence and treatment effect.

### A randomized study of solriamfetol for excessive sleepiness in narcolepsy [^06042fe2]. Annals of Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Randomization and Masking

Stratified randomization was performed based on the presence or absence of cataplexy, with patients assigned in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to treatment with solriamfetol 75, 150, or 300 mg, or placebo. The investigator accessed an Interactive Voice Response System or an Interactive Web Response System to randomize eligible patients.

All study personnel were blinded to the study treatments, and a double‐blind approach was used whereby all study drugs were prepared in identical opaque gelatin capsules to ensure adequate blinding.

Interventions and Outcomes

Patients who met all inclusion and no exclusion criteria and were randomized to the treatment groups received oral placebo or solriamfetol 75, 150, or 300 mg once daily for 12 weeks. Patients who were randomized to the 150 and 300 mg doses received 75 and 150 mg, respectively, on days 1 through 3 of the first week, with the full dose commencing on day 4.

The coprimary endpoints were change from baseline to week 12 on (1) MWT mean sleep latency on the first 4 trials of the MWT and (2) ESS score. The MWT was performed after in‐clinic overnight polysomnography at baseline and weeks 1, 4, and 12 or early termination, and the ESS was completed by the patients at baseline and weeks 1, 4, 8, and 12 or early termination. If data from ≥ 2 of the first 4 individual MWT trials were missing at a given time point, the mean sleep latency on the MWT was set to missing at that specific time point. If data from only 1 of the first 4 individual MWT trials were missing, the mean of the remaining 3 of the first 4 MWT trials was used for calculating the mean sleep latency on the MWT for that individual at that specific time point. The ESS total score is the sum of 8 item scores. If ≥ 3 item scores on the ESS were missing at a specific time point, the ESS total score was set to missing. If only 1 or 2 ESS items were missing at a specific time point, the mean of the remaining 7 or 6 nonmissing ESS items for that individual at that time point was used to impute the missing ESS items. In these cases, the ESS total score was calculated as the sum of the observed and the imputed item scores.

### Solriamfetol (Sunosi) [^c9f7cb23]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

A total of 239 patients with narcolepsy were randomized to receive SUNOSI 75 mg, 150 mg, or 300 mg (two times the maximum recommended daily dose), or placebo once daily. Patients randomized to the 150-mg dose received 75 mg for the first 3 days before increasing to 150 mg.

Demographic and baseline disease characteristics were similar for the SUNOSI and placebo groups. Median age was 34 years (range 18 to 70 years), 65% were female, 80% were Caucasian, 14% were African American, and 3% were Asian. Approximately 51% of patients had cataplexy.

Compared to the placebo group, patients randomized to 150 mg SUNOSI showed statistically significant improvements on the MWT (treatment effect difference: 7.7 minutes, Table 6) and on the ESS (treatment effect difference: 3.8 points, Table 7) at Week 12. These effects were apparent at Week 1 and consistent with the results at Week 12. The change on percentage of subjects reported as improved by PGIc was also statistically significant compared with placebo. There were trends toward improvement in the SUNOSI 75-mg treatment group (Tables 6 and 7); however, these changes were not statistically significant. There was no evidence of differential efficacy in patients with cataplexy and patients without cataplexy. Examination of subgroups by age, race, and sex did not suggest differences in response.

At Week 12, 150 mg of SUNOSI demonstrated improvements in wakefulness compared to placebo as assessed in test sessions 1 (approximately 1 hour post-dose) through 5 (approximately 9 hours post-dose) of the MWT (Figure 2). Nighttime sleep as measured with polysomnography was not affected by the use of SUNOSI in Study 1.

### Treatment of central disorders of hypersomnolence: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^6e717494]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Central disorders of hypersomnolence — treatment selection and evidence considerations: Clinicians should individualize treatment selections based on patients' age, pregnancy status and reproductive planning, comorbidities including cardiovascular disease, allergies/history of adverse events, risk of dependency/potential for drug misuse, and goals of care, and clinicians should be aware that additional nonpharmacological management with workplace or educational disability accommodations, sleep hygiene, and cognitive-behavioral therapy/psychological support is often needed. The task force developed recommendations using GRADE and describes this as a rigorous, patient-centered, transparent system, but noted limitations including small sample sizes, variable costs without cost-benefit data, rare randomized controlled evaluations of older treatments, virtually nonexistent comparative effectiveness studies, and reliance mostly on expert opinion to define outcomes and thresholds. The guideline includes newly FDA-approved pharmacological treatments, namely solriamfetol and pitolisant for adults and sodium oxybate for pediatric populations, but the task force evaluated data for individual medications rather than entire classes; although they did not make class-wide indication recommendations, it may be reasonable to assume that closely related compounds will have similar risks and benefits. The task force was only able to make recommendations when sufficient data were present and states that the absence of an intervention from the guideline should not be misinterpreted as a statement against its clinical use.

Narcolepsy in adults — solriamfetol (Recommendation 4) is directed as follows: We recommend that clinicians use solriamfetol (vs no treatment) for the treatment of narcolepsy in adults. (STRONG). Remark notes that this is an FDA Schedule IV federally controlled substance because of its potential for abuse or dependence, and based on animal data, solriamfetol may cause fetal harm with human data insufficient to determine risk. The TF identified 3 RCTs in narcolepsy type 1 and narcolepsy type 2 that demonstrated clinically significant improvements in excessive daytime sleepiness and disease severity; the overall quality of evidence was considered high. Across studies, commonly reported adverse events included headache, decreased appetite, insomnia, nausea, and chest discomfort, and most were mild or moderate in severity. The balance of risks and harms is likely different for pregnant and breastfeeding women, and the majority of patients would most likely use solriamfetol compared to no treatment for their narcolepsy.

### Solriamfetol for excessive daytime sleepiness in Parkinson's disease: phase 2 proof-of-concept trial [^4f3e471c]. Movement Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This was the first study to assess solriamfetol treatment in participants with EDS and PD. No new AEs or safety concerns were identified in this population compared with the known safety profile of solriamfetol in narcolepsy and OSA. Additionally, this is the first investigation of solriamfetol in participants using concomitant dopaminergic agents. All participants were on dopaminergic therapy (mean levodopa equivalent dose 623 mg). Coadministration of both agents in this short‐term study did not lead to an AE profile different from solriamfetol monotherapy in narcolepsy or OSA. Importantly, solriamfetol is contraindicated with MAO inhibitors, and 20 participants were on MAO‐B inhibitors in this study. Long‐term trials in larger samples are needed to further evaluate the safety and tolerability of solriamfetol with concomitant dopaminergic agents or MAO inhibitors.

There were no statistical differences in ESS scores with solriamfetol compared with placebo; however, additional analyses revealed that the main analysis was likely confounded by carryover effects. Similar carryover effects were observed on PGI‐C. The placebo response observed on self‐report measures (ESS and PGI‐C) was not evident on MWT. The main analysis for MWT showed dose‐dependent effects, and solriamfetol 300 mg increased sleep latency by 5 minutes compared with placebo. A minimum clinically important change in MWT sleep latency has not been established in patients with PD. However, in participants with narcolepsy or OSA, an increase of 4 minutes is associated with PGI‐C ratings of "minimally improved" or better, and an increase of 7 minutes is associated with ratings of "much improved" or better. Solriamfetol's PK profile was consistent with previous reports in healthy volunteers and participants with narcolepsy or OSA, suggesting differences in efficacy are likely not attributable to differences in solriamfetol exposure.

### Solriamfetol for excessive sleepiness in obstructive sleep apnea (TONES 3). A randomized controlled trial [^05ca6c79]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Rationale: Primary treatment of obstructive sleep apnea can be accompanied by a persistence of excessive sleepiness despite adherence. Furthermore, effectiveness of sleep apnea treatment is limited by poor adherence. Currently available pharmacologic options for the treatment of sleepiness in this population are limited. Objectives: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of solriamfetol (JZP-110), a selective dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor with robust wake-promoting effects, for the treatment of excessive sleepiness in participants with obstructive sleep apnea with current or prior sleep apnea treatment. Methods: This was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, 12-week trial comparing solriamfetol, 37.5, 75, 150, and 300 mg, with placebo. Measurements and Main Results: Of 476 randomized participants, 459 were included in the prespecified efficacy analyses. Coprimary endpoints (Maintenance of Wakefulness Test sleep latency and Epworth Sleepiness Scale score) were met at all solriamfetol doses (P < 0.05), with dose-dependent effects observed at Week 1 maintained over the study duration. All doses except 37.5 mg resulted in higher percentages of participants reporting improvement on Patient Global Impression of Change (key secondary endpoint; P < 0.05). Adverse events were reported in 47.9% of placebo- and 67.9% of solriamfetol-treated participants; five participants experienced serious adverse events (two [1.7%] placebo, three [0.8%] solriamfetol); none were deemed related to study drug. The most common adverse events with solriamfetol were headache (10.1%), nausea (7.9%), decreased appetite (7.6%), anxiety (7.0%), and nasopharyngitis (5.1%). Conclusions: Solriamfetol significantly increased wakefulness and reduced sleepiness in participants with obstructive sleep apnea and excessive sleepiness; most adverse events were mild or moderate in severity. Clinical trial registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02348606) and www.eudract.ema.europa.eu (EudraCT 2014-005514-31).

### Randomized controlled trial of solriamfetol for excessive daytime sleepiness in OSA: an analysis of subgroups adherent or nonadherent to OSA treatment [^d02d1abc]. Chest (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study of adults with EDS associated with OSA, the effects of solriamfetol in treating EDS were similar in participants adherent and nonadherent to primary OSA therapy. The adherent and nonadherent subgroups both demonstrated dose-dependent improvements in MWT, ESS score, FOSQ-10 total score, and PGI-C over the 12-week study. Moreover, among individuals who used devices as primary OSA therapy at study entry, no clinically meaningful changes in device use occurred over the 12-week study.

Both subgroups demonstrated clinically meaningful changes in MWT, ESS, and FOSQ-10 values. In comparison with baseline, adherent and nonadherent subgroups taking solriamfetol demonstrated mean increases in MWT sleep latency ranging from 3.2 to 13.4 minutes, mean decreases in ESS score ranging from 4.3 to 8.9 points, and mean increases in FOSQ-10 total score ranging from 1.5 to 3.5 points. These changes generally exceed the threshold values corresponding to clinically meaningful improvements (changes rated by patients or clinicians as at least minimally improved) of 4 min for the MWTand four points for the ESS, and the threshold for a minimal clinically important difference of 1.7 to 2.0 points on the FOSQ-10. In fact, for most doses of solriamfetol, the data exceed threshold values corresponding to changes rated by patients or clinicians as much or very much improved of 7 min for the MWT and 6 points for the ESS. Moreover, the magnitude of the improvement in wakefulness and functional status in both subgroups was substantial, as indicated by the high percentage of individuals who achieved MWT sleep latencies of ≥ 20 min (lower limit of normal), ESS scores of ≤ 10 (within the normal range,), and FOSQ-10 total scores of ≥ 17.9 (lower limit of normal) in the solriamfetol treatment groups (e-Table 1). In contrast, meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials of modafinil or armodafinil in PAP-adherent individuals with EDS showed increases in MWT sleep latency of 2.5 to 3.0 min and decreases in ESS score of 2.2 to 3.0 points. However, directly comparing MWT outcomes from these meta-analyses with the current study has limitations, including differences in maximal test duration (20–30 min for most modafinil and armodafinil studiesvs 40 min for the current study).

### A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase II study assessing safety, tolerability, and efficacy of bryostatin in the treatment of moderately severe to severe Alzheimer's disease [^1fcbf5b7]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2019). Medium credibility.

METHODS

Study design and patients

As a first-in-Alzheimer's-patients, multiple dose trial, safety and tolerability were the primary objectives, and bryostatin's efficacy for cognitive improvement was the secondary objective. The Full Analysis Set (FAS, mITT, modified intent to treat) as well as the Completer Analysis Set (CAS) were each included in the pre-specified Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) as alternative population sets to assess the primary, secondary, and exploratory efficacy endpoints. The mITT included trial participants who dropped out (Fig. 3) prior to the 13-week time point. Bryostatin efficacy was considered more directly related, however, to Severe Impairment Battery (SIB) scores of patients who in fact received the entire planned drug dose regimen. The primary endpoint was quantified at 13 weeks for patients in the mITT group, and as an alternate population, for patients who received the full dosing schedule of 12 weeks, and had a completed SIB score measure at the week 13 time point (CAS). Similarly, secondary endpoints at 5, 9, and 15 weeks were evaluated in patients who received drug at those time points. The SIB was the primary metric of cognitive performance, while a secondary metric, the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study – Activities of Daily Living - Severe Impairment Version (ADCS-ADL-SIV), provided additional data on functional benefit.

### A randomized study of solriamfetol for excessive sleepiness in narcolepsy [^c1810603]. Annals of Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

The percentage of patients who reported improvement on the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGI‐C) 22 at week 12 was the key secondary endpoint. Other secondary endpoints were time course on the MWT as measured by the change in sleep latency on each of the 5 MWT trials; change in the mean sleep latency from baseline to week 4; change in ESS from baseline to weeks 1, 4, and 8; percentage of patients who reported improvement on the PGI‐C at weeks 1, 4, and 8; and percentage of patients reported improved at weeks 1, 4, 8, and 12 on the Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGI‐C). 22 Improvements on the global scales were defined by responses reflecting "minimal", "much", or "very much" improved. Change in the mean and median weekly number of cataplexy attacks was an exploratory endpoint among the subgroup of patients who reported the presence of cataplexy. These patients completed a cataplexy frequency diary to record the number of cataplexy attacks that they had each day, beginning after discontinuation of narcolepsy medication and through week 12.

Safety and tolerability evaluation included the incidence of all adverse events reported by the patients, who were queried about adverse events at each clinic visit and during telephone contact calls for the weeks where no clinic visits were scheduled, as well as those adverse events noted by the investigator. Weight, vital signs, electrocardiograms, and the Columbia‐Suicide Severity Rating Scale 23 were assessed at each clinic visit. On the days when MWT was performed, blood pressure and heart rate measurements were collected at 7 time points, with the average of these time points from predose to 9 hours postdose used for evaluating change from baseline. Additionally, blood pressure and heart rate were assessed at 30‐minute intervals using 24‐hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring at baseline and at week 8. Mean values for blood pressure and heart rate were calculated over the 24‐hour period for each individual, and mean changes from screening to week 8 were summarized.

### A randomized study of solriamfetol for excessive sleepiness in narcolepsy [^5fc366dc]. Annals of Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Differences from placebo for changes on the MWT in the current study were 7.7 and 10.1 minutes for solriamfetol 150 and 300 mg, respectively. These values are substantially larger than what has been reported for modafinil, a dopamine reuptake inhibitor that is currently one of the most widely prescribed drugs for the treatment of ES in narcolepsy. Differences from placebo of 2.81 minutes (95% CI = 2.10–3.53) and 2.82 minutes (95% CI = 2.40–3.24) were reported in a meta‐analysis of modafinil parallel‐group studies in narcolepsy and all modafinil narcolepsy studies (ie, parallel‐group and crossover combined), respectively, 29 and the effects of modafinil were shown to be similar (ie, noninferior) to pitolisant. 30 Although the current clinical trial utilized a 40‐minute MWT, whereas other reports used 20‐ and 40‐minute measurements, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37 the apparently larger effects of solriamfetol in this study may be related to its activity as a dual dopamine/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor that lacks the serotonergic effects or norepinephrine‐releasing effects of other drugs. 38 The differences in ESS between solriamfetol and placebo were −4.7 for 300 mg and −3.8 for 150 mg, whereas a difference of −2.73 (95% CI = −3.39 to −2.00) was reported for modafinil in the meta‐analysis. 29 However, in the absence of head‐to‐head studies of solriamfetol and modafinil/armodafinil, outcomes from this study cannot be directly compared with results obtained with other agents.

Defining efficacy in insomnia treatment — there are unresolved issues regarding the evaluation of efficacy, including the relative importance of subjective versus objective data; whether metrics of sleep quality such as microstructure or physiological parameters are more pertinent than SL, TST or WASO; whether efficacy is better reflected by daytime alertness and cognitive, emotional, and psychomotor function than by measures of sleep; and using response or remission of the insomnia syndrome as the most clinically-relevant outcome, noting identification of "non-complaining poor sleepers" whose quantitative sleep measures are similar to those with insomnia.

Cholinesterase inhibitors — donepezil in Alzheimer's disease has been evaluated in more than 15 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials, with trial sizes from fewer than 20 subjects to 818 subjects and durations most commonly 12–24 weeks, including at least two that lasted 1 year and one that lasted more than 2 years. Studies largely enrolled community-dwelling patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE] 10–26), with additional studies in moderate to severe dementia (MMSE 5–17) and early Alzheimer's disease (MMSE 21–26), and one trial included nursing home residents; published studies consistently have found a benefit of donepezil over placebo. The effect size has been about 1 point on the MMSE and 3 points on the ADAS-cog (Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale–cognitive), improvement was lost over a 3–6-week period after cessation, and a 6-week treatment interruption did not restore cognition and function to pre-discontinuation levels when restarted at the original dose. Most studies report 5 mg/day dosing with 10 mg/day showing greater benefit in some but not all comparisons, and donepezil is administered once daily.

Introduction

Excessive sleepiness (hypersomnolence) is a prominent characteristic of a variety of medical and psychiatric conditions that include disorders of central hypersomnia (e.g. narcolepsy), sleep-related breathing disorders (e.g. obstructive sleep apnea; OSA), and neurodegenerative conditions (e.g. Parkinson's disease). Traditional stimulants (amphetamines, methylphenidate) and wake-promoting agents (modafinil, armodafinil) are used to treat excessive sleepiness in these conditions; however, these drugs are associated with limitations that include abuse potential, and poor tolerability and/or suboptimal response in some patients. Consequently, there remains a need for additional therapeutic options for patients with excessive sleepiness, which has been shown to contribute to the substantial economic and humanistic burdens associated with these diseases. These burdens include increased healthcare resource utilization, reductions in quality of life and work productivity, and higher risk of motor vehicle and occupational accidents relative to the general population.

Solriamfetol (JZP-110) is a selective dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (DNRI) with robust wake-promoting effects that is being developed to improve wakefulness and reduce excessive sleepiness associated with narcolepsy, OSA, and Parkinson's disease. In 12-week clinical trials in adults with narcolepsy, solriamfetol had robust effects at doses of 150 to 300 mg/day (the highest planned therapeutic dose) one week after the beginning of treatment, with significant reductions in participant-reported excessive sleepiness measured on the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), and global improvements assessed by participants and physicians compared with placebo. Objective assessment of the ability to stay awake on the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT) indicated significant improvements from baseline relative to placebo with both solriamfetol doses. In two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in participants with OSA, solriamfetol also demonstrated significant improvements from baseline in ESS scores and MWT sleep latency at six weeks and at 12 weeks.

### Solriamfetol (Sunosi) [^663972ca]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

At Week 12, 37.5 mg, 75 mg, and 150 mg of SUNOSI all demonstrated improvements in wakefulness compared to placebo as assessed in test sessions 1 (approximately 1 hour post-dose) through 5 (approximately 9 hours post-dose) of the MWT (Figure 3). Nighttime sleep as measured with polysomnography was not affected by the use of SUNOSI in Study 2. Patients' compliance with a primary OSA therapy device was similar across the placebo and SUNOSI treatment groups at baseline, and did not change during the 12-week study period in any treatment group.

Figure 3: Maintenance of Wakefulness Test Improvements in Test Sessions 1 through 5 in Patients with OSA in Study 2 at Week 12

14.3 Maintenance of Efficacy in Narcolepsy and OSA

The maintenance of effect of SUNOSI in improving wakefulness and reducing excessive daytime sleepiness in patients with narcolepsy and OSA was assessed in two randomized-withdrawal, placebo-controlled studies, Study 3 (NCT02348619) and Study 4 (NCT02348632).) and Study 4 (NCT02348632).

Study 3 was a 6-week, multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized-withdrawal study in 174 adult patients with a diagnosis of OSA. The co-primary efficacy endpoints were change from the beginning to the end of the randomized withdrawal period in MWT and ESS. During a 2-week, open-label titration phase, patients were started on SUNOSI 75 mg once daily, and were titrated to the maximum tolerable dose between 75 mg and 300 mg per day (two times the maximum recommended daily dose). Patients were continued on this dose for a 2-week stable-dose phase. At the end of the stable-dose phase, 124 patients who reported "much" or "very much" improvement on the PGIc and who showed improvements on the MWT and ESS entered a double-blind withdrawal phase and were randomized 1:1 to either continue SUNOSI at the dose received in the stable-dose phase or switch to placebo. Compared to patients who remained on SUNOSI, patients randomized to placebo experienced statistically significant worsening of sleepiness as measured by the MWT and ESS (Table 8).

Primary and key secondary endpoints

At doses that were found in this study to produce similar peak ratings of Strength of Drug Effect (e.g. phentermine 90 mg and solriamfetol 1200 mg or phentermine 45 mg and solriamfetol 600 mg), mean Liking at the Moment ratings for phentermine were numerically higher over the first 12 h of dosing, indicating greater liking of supratherapeutic doses of phentermine relative to supratherapeutic doses of solriamfetol; see Figure 2. The maximum mean liking effect for the high dose of phentermine 90 mg was larger and occurred sooner after drug administration than the peak for solriamfetol 1200 mg. A post hoc analysis of time to Peak Liking at the Moment (E max) for individual participants showed that the time of peak liking (T max) tended to be later after administration of solriamfetol 1200 mg than after phentermine 90 mg (156.9 (standard error (SE) 13.8) vs. 131.9 (13.1) min, respectively; p = 0.09).

Higher percentages of participants taking solriamfetol reported overall improvement on the PGI-C relative to placebo, regardless of adherence to primary OSA therapy, with the exception of the nonadherent subgroup taking the 37.5-mg dose (Fig 4). In both the adherent and nonadherent subgroups, FOSQ-10 total score increased from baseline to week 12 in a dose-dependent manner in all solriamfetol treatment groups relative to placebo (Fig 5). A Breslow-Day test for homogeneity and an alternative model that included the treatment by adherence interaction term were run for the PGI-C and FOSQ-10 end points, respectively. The test for homogeneity for the PGI-C (P = 0.97) and the interaction term for the FOSQ-10 (P = 0.71) were not significant when comparing solriamfetol (combined doses) with placebo, indicating no significant modification or interaction of adherence on treatment effect for these outcomes. At week 12, a greater percentage of participants taking solriamfetol (combined dose groups) achieved MWT mean sleep latencies of ≥ 20 min, ESS scores of ≤ 10, and FOSQ-10 total scores of ≥ 17.8 relative to placebo, regardless of adherence status (e-Table 1).

Statistical Analyses

Baseline demographic and disease characteristics are presented for the mITT population. Analyses of efficacy and primary OSA therapy use data were based on the mITT population.

Prespecified analyses of MWT and ESS in subgroups (adherent or nonadherent) were performed using a mixed-effects repeated measures model with fixed effects for treatment, time, treatment-by-time interaction, and baseline value of the efficacy end point. A similar model was used to analyze change from baseline in FOSQ-10 total score. Results are presented as least squares mean change from baseline and SE, with least squares mean differences from placebo and 95% CIs for the coprimary end points. To compare percentages of participants improving on PGI-C, χ² tests were used; 95% CIs were calculated for the differences in proportions. Post hoc analyses were conducted to evaluate the interaction of adherence and nonadherence with these key efficacy variables, including the MWT, ESS, FOSQ-10 score, and PGI-C score. Descriptive analyses were performed to summarize average hours of primary OSA therapy per night (electronically retrievable data), percentage of nights that participants used primary OSA therapy at least half the night (diary data), and percentage of nights that participants used the device (from electronically retrievable and diary data). For participants with electronically retrievable data, missing data were imputed using a modified last observation carried forward approach. The missing daily data were imputed by carrying forward the last nonmissing observation up to the early termination date or the date of the end of that analysis period (weeks 1–4, weeks 5–8, and weeks 9–12), whichever was earlier. A post hoc sensitivity analysis also was conducted in which missing data within the analysis period were imputed using zero to evaluate the impact of the handling of missing data on the outcome. For participants with diary data, only nonmissing data were summarized, and no imputation method was used for missing data. Change from baseline to each analysis after the baseline period in the percentage of nights that the primary OSA therapy was used, number of hours per night that the primary OSA therapy was used, and the percentage of nights that the primary OSA therapy was used for more than half the night were analyzed with a Wilcoxon rank-sum test to compare each treatment group vs placebo and a combined solriamfetol group vs placebo. No formal hypothesis testing was prespecified in the statistical analysis plan. The statistical testing conducted was considered exploratory. As such, no adjustments were made for multiplicity, and all reported P values are nominal.

2.1 Important Considerations Prior to Initiating Treatment

Prior to initiating treatment with SUNOSI, ensure blood pressure is adequately controlled [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

2.2 General Administration Instructions

Administer SUNOSI orally upon awakening with or without food. Avoid taking SUNOSI within 9 hours of planned bedtime because of the potential to interfere with sleep if taken too late in the day.

SUNOSI 75 mg tablets are functionally scored tablets that can be split in half (37.5 mg) at the score line.

2.3 Dosage in Narcolepsy

Initiate SUNOSI at 75 mg once daily in adults with narcolepsy. The recommended dose range for SUNOSI is 75 mg to 150 mg once daily. Based on efficacy and tolerability, the dosage of SUNOSI may be doubled at intervals of at least 3 days. The maximum recommended dose is 150 mg once daily. Dosages above 150 mg daily do not confer increased effectiveness sufficient to outweigh dose-related adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

2.4 Dosage in OSA

Initiate SUNOSI at 37.5 mg once daily in adults with OSA. The recommended dosage range for SUNOSI is 37.5 mg to 150 mg once daily. Based on efficacy and tolerability, the dosage of SUNOSI may be doubled at intervals of at least 3 days. The maximum recommended dosage is 150 mg once daily. Dosages above 150 mg daily do not confer increased effectiveness sufficient to outweigh dose-related adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

2.5 Dosage Recommendations in Patients with Renal Impairment

Moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30–59 mL/min/1.73 m): Initiate dosing at 37.5 mg once daily. Based on efficacy and tolerability, dose may be increased to a maximum of 75 mg once daily after at least 7 days [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Severe renal impairment (eGFR 15–29 mL/min/1.73 m): Administer 37.5 mg once daily. The maximum recommended daily dose is 37.5 mg [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

End Stage Renal Disease (eGFR < 15 mL/min/1.73 m): SUNOSI is not recommended for use in patients with ESRD [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Randomized controlled trial of solriamfetol for excessive daytime sleepiness in OSA: an analysis of subgroups adherent or nonadherent to OSA treatment [^06b3bd44]. Chest (2021). Medium credibility.

Interpretation

Solriamfetol was effective in the treatment of EDS in participants with OSA, regardless of adherence or nonadherence to primary OSA therapy, and treatment with solriamfetol did not alter participants' use of primary OSA therapy. No meaningful differences in the safety or tolerability profiles were observed in the adherent and nonadherent groups. The inclusion of participants who were adherent and nonadherent to primary OSA therapy enhances the generalizability of these results in the real-world setting.

Take-home Points

Study Question: Does solriamfetol have differential effects on EDS based on adherence to primary OSA therapy and does solriamfetol affect primary OSA therapy use?

Results: In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial, changes from baseline to week 12 in MWT results, ESS score, FOSQ-10 total score, and PGI-C after 12 weeks of solriamfetol treatment relative to placebo were similar among participants who were adherent and nonadherent to primary OSA therapy. No clinically meaningful changes in primary OSA therapy device use were observed over the 12-week study, as measured by the percentage of nights of device use, number of hours per night of device use, or percentage of nights with use of a device for more than half of the night.

Interpretation: Solriamfetol effectively treated EDS in patients with OSA regardless of adherence to primary OSA therapy and did not affect primary OSA therapy device use over the 12-week study.

Results

Patient Population

Of the 239 patients who were randomized, 236 received at least 1 dose of study drug and were included in the safety population (Fig 1). The mITT population consisted of 231 patients; 1 patient randomized to placebo and 4 patients randomized to solriamfetol 150 mg did not have baseline or at least 1 postbaseline efficacy assessment of MWT and ESS. The discontinuation rate was highest in the solriamfetol 300 mg group (27.1%, with lack of efficacy [10.2%, n = 6] and adverse events [8.5%, n = 5] as the most common reasons for discontinuation), followed by the solriamfetol 75 mg (16.9%), placebo (10.3%), and solriamfetol 150 mg (7.3%) groups (see Fig 1). Discontinuation due to lack of efficacy did not appear to be dose‐related. Three of the 6 patients who discontinued due to lack of efficacy in the 300 mg group and 3 of the 4 patients who discontinued due to lack of efficacy in the 75 mg group had cataplexy at screening and had discontinued their anticataplectic medication(s) prior to starting study drug on day 1 of the current study.

Figure 1
Patient disposition. [Color figure can be viewed at]

Demographic and clinical characteristics were similar across treatment groups (Table 1). Overall, the majority of patients (64.4%) were rated by clinicians as moderately or markedly ill and were characterized by impaired wakefulness and ES, as indicated by baseline MWT mean sleep latency of 7.5 (SD = 5.7) minutes and ESS scores of 17.2 (SD = 3.2), respectively. Most patients (90.7%) had prior use of psychostimulants; prior use of sodium oxybate and antidepressants was reported for 25.8% and 34.7% of patients, respectively. Cataplexy was present in 50.8% of patients overall, with similar percentages of patients with cataplexy in each of the treatment groups (see Table 1); demographic and baseline characteristics were similar between patients with cataplexy and those without cataplexy (data not shown).

### Taking care of persistent sleepiness in patients with sleep apnea [^10596949]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Excessive sleepiness, a common manifestation of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), is present in 52–58% of sleep clinic patients with moderate or more OSA. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy reduces sleepiness with improvement dependent on the level of CPAP adherence. Despite high levels of adherence, it is clear that some individuals have persistent sleepiness. Persistent sleepiness (defined by an Epworth sleepiness score > 10) in the context of at least 3 hours of nightly CPAP use occurs in approximately 12–18% of patients, whereas 9% of patients have sleepiness despite more than 6 hours per night of use.

Persistent sleepiness has been used to justify the use of wake-promoting agents in patients with treated OSA. Modafinil, a weak inhibitor of dopamine reuptake, was the first alerting agent approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, in 2004, followed by the approval of its longer-acting R-enantiomer armodafinil in 2007. In this issue of the Journal, Schweitzer and colleagues (pp.) report findings from a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group 12-week trial of a novel alerting medication, solriamfetol, in sleepy individuals with OSA. Solriamfetol is a wake-promoting agent that inhibits reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine. Solriamfetol improved maintenance of wakefulness test outcomes and Epworth sleepiness score in a dose–response fashion. Effect sizes for maintenance of wakefulness test change were large and were maintained up to 9 hours at doses of 75 mg and above. Epworth sleepiness scores were reduced by more than 4 U at the higher doses evaluated (150 mg and higher), and by 1.5–2 U at the lower doses (37.5–70 mg). It was reassuring that solriamfetol use did not reduce CPAP adherence.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the management of chronic insomnia disorder and obstructive sleep apnea [^3c0d7f6e]. VA/DoD (2025). High credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)-related residual excessive daytime sleepiness — For treatment of obstructive sleep apnea-related residual excessive daytime sleepiness in patients who are optimally treated with sufficient therapy use, we suggest adding armodafinil, modafinil, solriamfetol (Weak for | Reviewed, New-added). The evidence supporting the above recommendation derives from four systematic reviews (SRs). Moderate quality evidence suggests that both modafinil and armodafinil improve the critical outcomes of sleepiness and quality of life (QoL). Low-quality evidence found no significant difference in the critical outcome of serious adverse events between either modafinil or armodafinil and placebo. Moderate quality evidence suggests that solriamfetol improves sleepiness. High-quality evidence suggests that solriamfetol improves QoL. Moderate quality evidence found no significant difference in serious adverse events between solriamfetol and placebo. Although there was available data for pitolisant showing improvements in sleepiness and QoL, it was not included in the recommendation as it is not FDA-approved for the treatment of residual daytime sleepiness in patients with OSA. There is some variation in patient preference regarding this treatment. Given that the available wake-promoting agents are controlled substances, some patients may be hesitant to take them or may be concerned about side effects. Further, some of these medications are expensive and may not be available for all patients. For active-duty service members, use of any of these medications may lead to occupational restrictions, deployment limitations or referral to a Medical Evaluation Board.

### Comparative efficacy, safety and benefit / risk of alerting agents for excessive daytime sleepiness in patients with obstructive sleep apnoea: a network meta-analysis [^b2151c63]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a common chronic respiratory disease associated with a high burden of disabilities related to sleepiness and reduced quality of life. Despite first-line treatment with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy, many patients experience residual excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS). The aim of this study is to compare the relative efficacy and safety of medications authorised for this indication in Europe and/or the United States (modafinil/armodafinil, solriamfetol, and pitolisant) for OSA.

Methods

In this systematic review and network meta-analysis, randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the efficacy and safety of authorised medications for adult patients with OSA were identified by literature searches of PubMed, Embase and ClinicalTrials.gov databases (up to 12 June 2024). The primary efficacy endpoint was combined Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and Oxford Sleep Resistance (OSLER)/Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT) Z-scores. Quality of life (QoL), overall and specific cardiovascular safety, and benefit-risk ratios were calculated. The study was registered with PROSPERO: CRD42023434640.

Findings

Of 4017 studies identified, a total of 20 RCTs involving 4015 patients were included. Analysis of combined subjective (ESS) and objective (OSLER/MWT) efficacy outcome Z-scores showed that solriamfetol (150 mg; effect size [ES] = 0.66 [95% CI: 0.36, 0.96]), pitolisant (20 mg; ES = 0.66 [95% CI: 0.44, 0.88]), and modafinil (200 mg; ES = 0.54: [95% CI: 0.33, 0.74]); 400 mg; ES = 0.54 [95% CI: 0.42, 0.65]) had a clinically meaningful improvement in efficacy. P-scores ranked placebo, then pitolisant, modafinil 200 mg, modafinil 400 mg and solriamfetol for overall safety; and pitolisant, then solriamfetol, modafinil 400 mg and modafinil 200 mg for benefit-risk ratio.

Interpretation

Pitolisant, solriamfetol and modafinil had comparable efficacy for maintaining wakefulness in patients with OSA. Pitolisant had a better safety profile and benefit-risk ratio compared with solriamfetol and modafinil. The overall and cardiovascular safety risk ratios suggest that pitolisant might be the best candidate for patients with OSA with multiple cardiovascular comorbidities.

Analysis of combined subjective (ESS) and objective (OSLER/MWT) efficacy outcome Z-scores showed that solriamfetol (150 mg; effect size [ES] = 0.66 [95% CI: 0.36, 0.96]), pitolisant (20 mg; ES = 0.66 [95% CI: 0.44, 0.88]), and modafinil (200 mg; ES = 0.54: [95% CI: 0.33, 0.74]); 400 mg; ES = 0.54 [95% CI: 0.42, 0.65]) had a clinically meaningful improvement in efficacy. P-scores ranked placebo, then pitolisant, modafinil 200 mg, modafinil 400 mg and solriamfetol for overall safety; and pitolisant, then solriamfetol, modafinil 400 mg and modafinil 200 mg for benefit-risk ratio.

Interpretation

Pitolisant, solriamfetol and modafinil had comparable efficacy for maintaining wakefulness in patients with OSA. Pitolisant had a better safety profile and benefit-risk ratio compared with solriamfetol and modafinil. The overall and cardiovascular safety risk ratios suggest that pitolisant might be the best candidate for patients with OSA with multiple cardiovascular comorbidities.

5 DATA COLLECTION

Study durations of at least 5 years are recommended to ensure adequate observation of longitudinal changes, given that Aβ plaque levels have been found to continue to decline beyond 4 years of treatment with some anti‐Aβ monoclonal antibodies.

To improve the diversity of enrolled participants, the FDA recommends accounting for logistical and patient‐related factors that may limit participation in clinical studies, for example, reducing the burden of study participation by minimizing study visits and employing enrollment practices that enhance inclusiveness. As such, study sites should be selected to represent a range of geographical locations and AD care settings (eg, academic centers, community memory clinics) with ethnically, racially, and socioeconomically diverse populations, as well as consideration of their ability to implement the core data elements. Data should typically be collected by trained site personnel as part of a structured interview (clinical assessment tools) or collected prospectively as part of an unstructured interview (medical history). For a real‐world study of this duration, it is recommended that data be gathered during routine visits conducted within the context of standard of care, with intervals for data collection of approximately 6 to 12 months. Self‐administered cognitive assessments, such as the Quick Dementia Rating System Patient Version (QDRS‐PV), which can be completed prior to the physician visit, may reduce study site burden, but they can be associated with some challenges, including reduced response validity (compliance, effort, motivation) because of a lack of monitoring, loss of qualitative data obtained from conventional evaluations, risk of interruptions, and lack of support for the patient if they are struggling to complete the task or experience technological problems.

An overview of the recommended schedule of data collection is shown in Figure 1. A detailed schedule of assessments is listed in Table S1; core data elements are noted to ensure consistency of clinical assessments and demographics collection, with data that may not be collected in routine practice considered optional to minimize study site burden and maximize real‐world relevance.

FIGURE 1
Schedule of data collection. *Study information may be collected at any routine clinical visits scheduled per local standard of care. Data from radiological assessments of MRI scans will be collected at each MRI visit. It is expected that after a patient reaches target dosing, information on each patient will be collected at the physician's discretion or as part of routine clinical practice, anticipated to be approximately every 6 to 12 months.

### Effects of solriamfetol in a long-term trial of participants with obstructive sleep apnea who are adherent or nonadherent to airway therapy [^2b87bb3f]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Study Objectives

Solriamfetol, a dopamine/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, is approved in the United States and European Union to treat excessive daytime sleepiness in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) (37.5–150 mg/day) and narcolepsy (75–150 mg/day). This analysis evaluated solriamfetol's efficacy in subgroups of participants with OSA who were adherent or nonadherent to primary OSA therapy at baseline and examined whether solriamfetol affected the use of primary therapy in an open-label extension trial.

Methods

Participants with OSA who completed prior solriamfetol studies received solriamfetol 75, 150, or 300 mg/day for ≤ 52 weeks. The main efficacy outcome was the Epworth Sleepiness Scale score. Primary therapy use was summarized as the percentage of nights, the number of hours/night, and the percentage of nights with use ≥ 50%/night (%). Efficacy and primary therapy use are reported for participants who directly enrolled from a previous 12-week study and had ≤ 40 weeks of open-label treatment (n = 333). Safety data are reported for all participants (n = 417).

Results

Mean ESS scores in adherent (n = 255) and nonadherent (n = 78) subgroups, respectively, were 15.0 and 15.8 at baseline (of 12-week study) and 6.5 and 6.8 at week 40. For participants using an airway therapy, mean use at baseline was 90% of nights, 6.6 hours/night, and use ≥ 50%/night on 90% of nights; changes from baseline to week 40 were minimal (0.9%, -0.8 hours, and 6.5%, respectively). Common adverse events (both subgroups) included headache, nasopharyngitis, insomnia, dry mouth, nausea, anxiety, and upper respiratory tract infection.

Conclusions

Long-term efficacy and safety of solriamfetol were similar regardless of adherence to primary OSA therapy. Solriamfetol did not affect primary therapy use.

### Evaluating the cognitive effects of donepezil 23 mg / D in moderate and severe Alzheimer's disease: analysis of effects of baseline features on treatment response [^e9871bf2]. BMC Geriatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Donepezil is a reversible and highly selective acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (AChEI) that is approved for the symptomatic treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In numerous clinical trials since 1997, donepezil 5 and 10 mg/d has been shown to provide clinical benefits, with acceptable tolerability in the core symptom domains of cognition, global functioning, and function in activities of daily living. Although both 5 and 10 mg doses have been shown to be effective in AD, an early systematic review of donepezil treatment and several subsequent clinical trials have indicated a relationship between benefits in cognition and higher donepezil dose. Moreover, the cognitive benefits of a higher donepezil dose seem to be most prominent at more advanced stages of AD.

In 2010, a higher daily dose of donepezil (23 mg) was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of moderate to severe AD. This approval was based on results from a large phase 3 clinical trial comparing the 23 mg/d donepezil dose with the standard 10 mg/d donepezil dose. In that trial, donepezil 23 mg/d provided statistically significant cognitive benefits over those achieved with donepezil 10 mg/d, as measured by the Severe Impairment Battery (SIB). On the co-primary measure of global function (the Clinician's Interview-Based Impression of Change-plus caregiver input [CIBIC-plus]), no significant benefit was observed with higher-dose versus standard-dose donepezil.

Although symptomatic benefits have been widely reported with donepezil and other AChEIs, treated patients typically respond variably. For example, in a pooled analysis of data from studies of donepezil 10 mg/d in patients with severe AD, 66.8% of donepezil-treated patients showed stabilized or improved scores on the SIB; however, in approximately one quarter of these "responding" patients, SIB scores were stabilized or improved less than 4 points, whereas in around one third of patients, SIB scores had improved by at least 12 points. A number of studies have investigated whether candidate factors, such as patient age, the rate of pretreatment decline, the extent of medial temporal lobe atrophy, and the level of cognitive impairment might influence response to AChEI treatment among patients with AD.

### Towards enhancing drug development methodology to treat cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia and other neuropsychiatric conditions: insights from 2 decades of clinical trials [^47828232]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2025). Medium credibility.

Some New Approaches to Consider

Our knowledge base regarding the complexities and obstacles to collecting high-quality cognitive data in large-scale clinical trials has grown since the MATRICS guidelines were established. Implementation of these guidelines in large-scale CIAS trials has proven operationally and practically complex. The high burden for patients, sites, and data monitors may translate into key sources of error variance in the cognitive data that are collected, undermining efforts to identify a treatment signal. In addition, new findings related to composite cognitive scores, functional capacity assessments, and the time course of effects of potential pro-cognitive agents raise questions about the current scientific rationale for some elements of the original guidelines.

To help our field move toward a more streamlined and efficient CIAS drug development pathway we offer the following refinements for consideration.

Allow shorter cognitive batteries that do not require coverage of all 7 MATRICS domains but yield meaningful and validated composite scores.
Establish clear, practically achievable criteria for suitable alternative cognitive batteries to address training, standardization, and data monitoring and quality control challenges.
Eliminate the concurrent co-primary requirement to demonstrate the functional significance of drug-related cognitive benefits. Assessment of ultimate functional impact could be separated from initial evaluation of efficacy for cognitive enhancers in a 2-tiered approval process, such as is used with antipsychotic treatment. For eg, functional effects could be evaluated in longer-term efficacy/safety follow-up studies (eg, post-marketing requirements) using standard functional outcome assessment strategies, including rating scales or milestone achievements (eg, transitioning to independent living or beginning work/school), particularly in enriched populations receiving specialized interventions such as supported employment. Several innovative, and potentially more sensitive, digital technology-based assessment approaches may also be useful for demonstrating functional benefits while minimizing participant/site burden. These include remote active digital phenotyping (eg, EMA assessments of functioning, functional capacity, and cognition during the course of daily life) and passive sensor-based digital phenotyping (eg, actigraphy, Global Positioning System data effortlessly collected from a smartphone or wearable device) metrics of elemental aspects of real-world daily functioning (eg, engaging in productive and/or social activities, frequency of leaving one's home, daily activity level, daytime napping). Remote assessment approaches have been shown to be feasible in studies as long as a year and could detect many predefined functional changes if they were to occur.
Support enrichment strategies that focus clinical trials on the target population most likely to benefit from cognitive enhancing treatments, namely, those with temporally stable, clinically meaningful cognitive impairment.
Develop rational guidelines for monotherapy trials considering the scientific and practical risks associated with lengthy outpatient placebo-controlled trials. These guidelines will need to consider the best comparator strategies, including randomized switching strategies for the new target agents.
Decrease the minimal trial length requirement and allow for duration flexibility based on a drug's mechanism of action and associated time course for producing effects on cognition. Durability of efficacy for cognition could be examined with the long-term real-world evidence strategies described above, which could also consider long-term adherence and late-occurring adverse events.

### A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study to evaluate the human abuse liability of solriamfetol, a selective dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor [^35a682c1]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2018). Low credibility.

Participants who met the Qualification Phase criteria were randomized in the Test Phase to one of six double-blind treatment sequences generated using the Williams method for Latin Square design. A statistician who had no contact with the participants nor involvement with assessment of their eligibility prepared and retained the master randomization code for both the Qualification and Test Phases. All study personnel except the study pharmacists were blinded to the study treatments, which were prepared in identical-looking capsules. The six treatments included single administration of placebo; solriamfetol 300, 600, and 1200 mg; and phentermine 45 and 90 mg. The FDA Guidance for the Assessment of the Abuse Potential of Drugs recommends that supratherapeutic doses two to three times the proposed therapeutic dose be assessed in HAL studies, and other expert reviews urge higher doses if they can be safely administered. Thus, choice of solriamfetol doses was based on results from previous clinical studies of solriamfetol in which 300 mg was the highest therapeutic dose; 1200 mg is the highest dose that has been administered to human participants and was considered safe to administer in this study.

### Solriamfetol titration&administRaTion (START) in patients with narcolepsy [^cd5ebb63]. Clinical Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Solriamfetol, a dopamine/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, is approved (in the United States and European Union) to treat excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) in adults with narcolepsy (75–150 mg/d) or obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) (37.5–150 mg/d). This study characterized real-world titration strategies for patients with narcolepsy (with or without comorbid OSA) initiating solriamfetol therapy.

Methods

This virtual, descriptive study included a retrospective medical record review and qualitative survey. US-based physicians prescribing solriamfetol for EDS associated with narcolepsy or OSA participated. Data are reported for patients with narcolepsy with or without comorbid OSA (OSA alone reported separately). On the basis of medical record review, titration strategies were classified de novo (EDS medication naive), transition (switched or switching from existing EDS medication[s] to solriamfetol), or add-on (adding solriamfetol to current EDS medication[s]). The survey included open-ended questions regarding a hypothetical patient-a 32-year-old woman with narcolepsy (Epworth Sleepiness Scale score of 8) treated with 35 mg/d of amphetamine and 6 g per night of sodium oxybate who experiences non-use-limiting adverse events from amphetamine.

Findings

Twenty-six physicians participated: 23 provided data from 70 patients with narcolepsy (type 1, n = 24; type 2, n = 46; mean [SD] age, 40 [11] years; 57% female; 6 with comorbid OSA), and 26 responded to the hypothetical patient scenario. From the medical record review, solriamfetol therapy initiation was de novo for 19 of 70 patients (27%), transition for 31 of 70 patients (44%), and add-on for 20 of 70 patients (29%). Efficacy profile of solriamfetol was the primary reason for de novo (12 of 19 [63%]), transition (18 of 31 [58%]), and add-on (19 of 20 [95%]) initiation. Most (86%) initiated use of solriamfetol at 75 mg/d and were stable at 150 mg/d (76%). Most (67%) had 1 dose adjustment, reaching a stable dose over a median (range) of 14 (1–60) days. Physicians most often considered EDS severity (44%) when titrating. Among transitioning patients, 14 of 22 (64%) using wake-promoting agents discontinued their use abruptly, and 5 of 9 (56%) using stimulants were tapered off. At data collection, 90% continued to take solriamfetol. Regarding the hypothetical patient scenario, most physicians (81%) thought solriamfetol was appropriate, highlighting tolerability issues with current treatment and lack of symptom control as drivers for switching; however, 3 physicians (12%) did not think solriamfetol was appropriate, noting current symptoms were not severe enough and/or symptoms could be managed by increasing sodium oxybate dose; 2 (8%) thought it would depend on other factors. Physicians emphasized managing withdrawal symptoms while maintaining EDS symptom control when titrating off a stimulant and starting solriamfetol therapy.

Implications

In a real-world study, physicians initiated solriamfetol therapy at 75 mg/d for most patients with narcolepsy, adjusted dosages once, tapered stimulants, and abruptly discontinued therapy with wake-promoting agents.

### Taking care of persistent sleepiness in patients with sleep apnea [^a9c5cfb9]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

The investigators addressed potential concerns regarding medication use. Adverse events were common (68% vs. 48% for placebo) but overwhelmingly mild to moderate in severity (95%). At lower doses, few adverse events led to drug discontinuation (< 6%), whereas at the highest dose, more participants were affected (14%). Of some concern, the highest dose caused a 2.5-mg increase in systolic and 1.5-mg increase in diastolic blood pressure. Further, heart rate increased by 2–3 beats per minute at doses above 75 mg. To put the potential effect of these small changes into perspective, it has been estimated that a 2 mm Hg decrease in average blood pressure in the general population would reduce all-cause mortality annually by 3%, whereas a 2–3 beats per minute increase in heart rate in healthy middle-aged men has been estimated to increase mortality over the course of 16 years by 3.2–4.8%.

This study has notable strengths. The investigators used a double-blind placebo control design, assessed a variety of doses, incorporated both objective and subjective measures of sleepiness, and monitored for a reasonable range of adverse effects over the course of 12 weeks. There is little doubt that solriamfetol has robust clinically important effects on alertness at doses of 75 mg and higher and is reasonably tolerated by many patients in the short term. The authors note two limitations: the study's duration limits an assessment of potential long-term cardiovascular consequences, and the lack of an active comparator such as modafinil prevents a firm understanding of relative efficacy.

An important issue that cannot be addressed in the context of an efficacy study is whether the medication will eventually be used in an appropriate population. Specifically, will primary and reversible causes of persistent hypersomnia be addressed before patients are prescribed the medication? This concern is heightened by some of the trial's inclusion criteria: patients not currently using effective OSA therapy and those with as few as 6 hours of sleep per night. Although there are valid scientific reasons to retain these patients, their inclusion may encourage the use of this medication in cases in which reversible causes of sleepiness are not adequately addressed. This would unnecessarily expose patients not only to the unknown long-term adverse consequences of the medication but also to the potential adverse effects of untreated OSA and sleep deprivation.

### A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study to evaluate the human abuse liability of solriamfetol, a selective dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor [^4cf05ac0]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2018). Low credibility.

Materials and methods

Study design

This study received Institutional Review Board approval from Midlands Independent Review Board (Overland Park, KS, USA) and was conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice and the Declaration of Helsinki; all participants provided written informed consent. Design and implementation of the study was also consistent with the 2010 FDA draft guidance for HAL studies, which was finalized after this study concluded. The study used a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design that included a Screening Phase, a Qualification Phase, and a Test Phase. The Qualification and Test Phases were conducted in a closed residential research unit where caffeine was not available and smoking was limited to certain times of the day. On dosing days, cigarette smokers were allowed to smoke one cigarette upon rising and then were not allowed to smoke until after the 6-h assessment was completed. Smoking was not allowed within 30 min prior to the eight- and 12-h assessments; smoking was allowed on washout and non-dosing days after vital signs and any scheduled 24-h assessments were completed.

Participants were evaluated for eligibility during the Screening Phase. A standard medical evaluation was conducted that included a medical history and physical examination, vital signs assessment, 12-lead electrocardiography, and laboratory evaluations.

Participants who met eligibility criteria entered a six-day Qualification Phase in which they were randomized (1:1) to receive either a sequence of placebo on day 1 and phentermine 60 mg on day 4 or a sequence of phentermine 60 mg on day 1 and placebo on day 4 under double-blind conditions. Participants who tolerated phentermine in the Qualification Phase and who reported greater liking for phentermine versus placebo, time-dependent effects, and neutral liking for placebo were enrolled in the Test Phase. Greater liking was defined as peak liking ⩾15 points higher for phentermine versus placebo on a 0–100 bipolar liking/disliking visual analog scale (VAS; 0 = strong disliking and 100 = strong liking) and neutral liking was a VAS score between 40 and 60.

### A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study to evaluate the human abuse liability of solriamfetol, a selective dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor [^8f4b4cde]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Solriamfetol may have abuse potential similar to or lower than phentermine. More than half of the stimulant-using participants in this study did not report next day Overall Drug Liking after supratherapeutic doses of solriamfetol, next day ratings of Take Again were significantly lower for all doses of solriamfetol compared with either dose of phentermine, and ratings of negative subjective effects increased at higher doses of solriamfetol with two participants discontinuing participation after receiving the solriamfetol 1200 mg dose, which suggests that the likelihood of dose escalation and abuse of high doses of solriamfetol is low. There were no serious adverse events after administration with solriamfetol despite inclusion of supratherapeutic doses of 600 and 1200 mg, and the safety profile of solriamfetol was consistent with previous studies.

Regarding medical management for obstructive sleep apnea, more specifically with respect to management of daytime sleepiness, DoD/VA 2025 guidelines recommend to consider adding armodafinil, modafinil, or solriamfetol for the treatment of OSA-related residual excessive daytime sleepiness in patients who are optimally treated with sufficient therapy use.

### Solriamfetol treatment of excessive daytime sleepiness in participants with narcolepsy or obstructive sleep apnea with a history of depression [^5ebeee6e]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Given the high rate of depression associated with narcolepsy or obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), this analysis compared effects of solriamfetol treatment of excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) in participants with/without a history of depression (DHx+/DHx-). This secondary analysis included data from two randomized, controlled trials in which participants were randomized to 12 weeks placebo or solriamfetol 37.5 (OSA only), 75, 150, or 300 mg/day. Efficacy/safety (combined solriamfetol doses) was summarized for DHx+/DHx-subgroups. 27.5% (65/236) with narcolepsy and 23.4% (111/474) with OSA were DHx+. In narcolepsy (DHx+ and DHx-), 40-min Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT40) mean sleep latency increased (5.4 and 7.0 min), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) score decreased (3.8 and 3.5 points), and percentage of participants improved on Patient Global Impression of Change (PGI-C) was higher (31.7% and 39.4%) relative to placebo. In OSA (DHx+ and DHx-), MWT40 mean sleep latency increased (7.7 and 10.7 min), ESS decreased (3.5 and 3.7 points), and percentage of participants improved on PGI-C was higher (41.1% and 29.4%) relative to placebo. Common treatment-emergent adverse events (headache, decreased appetite, nausea, anxiety) were similar in DHx+/DHx-. This study suggests that safety and efficacy of solriamfetol for treating EDS in narcolepsy and OSA are not affected by depression history. Moreover, the findings emphasize the high prevalence of depression in people with sleep disorders and suggest that increased awareness of this association may have clinical significance.

### A randomized study of solriamfetol for excessive sleepiness in narcolepsy [^67920743]. Annals of Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Table 3
TEAEs in the Safety Population

Adverse events with an incidence ≥ 5% in combined solriamfetol dose groups included headache (21.5%), nausea (10.7%), decreased appetite (10.7%), nasopharyngitis (9.0%), dry mouth (7.3%), and anxiety (5.1%; see Table 3). A post hoc analysis was conducted of the incidence of headache‐related events, including headache and migraine, in patients who either had or who did not have headache, such as headache, migraine, tension headache, or cluster headache, in their medical history. This analysis showed that patients who had a medical history of headache had a higher rate of headache during the study relative to those without a medical history of headache (14.3% vs 4.4% in the placebo group, and 31% vs 19.3% in the combined solriamfetol group). However, there did not appear to be a differential increase in the incidence of headache or migraine in the solriamfetol group compared with the placebo group between the subgroups of patients with and without a medical history of headache. Insomnia was reported in 2.8% of patients with solriamfetol and none with placebo; no patient discontinued the study due to insomnia.

No drug‐related effects were found on clinical laboratory assessments. The average of vital signs taken from predose to 9 hours postdose showed an increase from baseline in systolic and diastolic blood pressure (1–2 mmHg) and heart rate (2–4 beats per minute) for solriamfetol 150 and 300 mg dose relative to minimal changes (< 1 mmHg or beats per minute) for placebo (Table 4). These effects on blood pressure and heart rate from baseline to week 8 using 24‐hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring were similar to what was observed during the days on which MWT was performed (see Table 4). No patient had a treatment‐emergent adverse event of hypertension, and 2 patients had a treatment‐emergent adverse event of blood pressure increase (1 in the 150 mg group and 1 in the 300 mg group). Study drug was not interrupted in either case, and both patients completed the study.

### Pitolisant for daytime sleepiness in patients with obstructive sleep apnea who refuse continuous positive airway pressure treatment. A randomized trial [^51bff09b]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Adherence to CPAP is a major issue when treating OSA. It is estimated that 10–15% of patients with OSA initially refuse or quickly abandon CPAP in the first weeks of treatment. The long-term rate of CPAP discontinuation is consistent across studies at between 20% and 40%. No clear improvement in mean CPAP adherence has been seen over the last 20 years, despite considerable technical advances, behavioral interventions, and multimodal telemonitoring systems. This leaves thousands of patients with symptomatic OSA with untreated daytime sleepiness. An original and unique aspect of our study was the targeted OSA population comprising only patients with EDS refusing CPAP. In the two recent solriamfetol studies, the study populations were heterogeneous, with approximately one-third of patients having no OSA primary treatment. In the study by Strollo and colleagues, a post hoc subanalysis showed that ESS score, maintenance of wakefulness, and CGI change scale score were slightly better in nonadherent patients than in those adhering to CPAP. It remains controversial whether targeting EDS alone without addressing the underlying cause is an acceptable practice, and doing so might lead to misuse. However, from a pragmatic point of view, these patients often remain untreated and have a poor quality of life, loss of productivity, and risk of EDS-related accidents. Another major issue beyond symptom improvement is to ensure that a given wake-promoting agent does not precipitate or exacerbate OSA-related cardiovascular comorbidities, as already reported for psychostimulants used in narcolepsy acting via dopamine or norepinephrine release. However, in this pitolisant trial, no significant changes were found in terms of blood pressure or heart rate, which provides a reassurance of safety. In contrast, in a recent meta-analysis, modafinil and armodafinil were associated with a mean increase in systolic blood pressure of 3.0 mm Hg (95% CI, 0.8–5.2 mm Hg) and a mean increase in diastolic blood pressure of 1.9 mm Hg (95% CI, 0.5–3.3 mm Hg) in three of seven trials. In a recent study using solriamfetol, the highest dose caused increases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure of 2.5 and 1.5 mm Hg, respectively, and heart rate increased by 2–3 beats per minute at doses greater than 75 mg. Again, head-to-head comparisons of the various clinically available wake-promoting agents, with particular focus on cardiovascular outcomes, are needed.

### A phase I, randomized, crossover, open-label study of the pharmacokinetics of solriamfetol (JZP-110) in healthy adult subjects with and without food [^7f79fd71]. Clinical Therapeutics (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Solriamfetol (JZP-110), a selective dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor with robust wake-promoting effects, is currently being evaluated for the reduction of sleepiness and improvement of wakefulness in patients with narcolepsy and obstructive sleep apnea. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of food on the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters and bioavailability of solriamfetol at the highest intended therapeutic dose in healthy adults and to characterize its renal excretion under fasting conditions.

Methods

In this open-label, randomized, crossover study, healthy adult subjects received a single 300-mg dose of solriamfetol in a fasted condition (10 h) and in a fed condition (30 min after the start of a standardized high-fat, high-calorie breakfast), with at least a 7-day washout period between doses. Blood samples for PK analyses were collected during both conditions at prespecified time points. Urine samples were collected up to 48 h postdose in the fasted condition. Samples were analyzed for solriamfetol (plasma and urine) and N-acetyl solriamfetol (urine) by using validated LC-MS/MS bioanalytical methods. The effect of food on solriamfetol relative bioavailability was examined by comparing the 90% confidence intervals (CIs) of the fed/fasted ratios of natural log-transformed PK parameters C max, AUC 0-t, and AUC 0-∞ with the prespecified range of 80%-125%. Safety and tolerability were also assessed.

Findings

A total of 32 subjects were enrolled (50% female; 53.1% black, 46.9% white; mean age, 35.6 years), and 31 were included in the PK analyses. Solriamfetol was rapidly absorbed in both conditions. The 90% CIs for the fed/fasted geometric mean ratios were 89.2–98.8 for C max (ratio of 93.9%) and 93.8–101.5 for AUC 0-∞ (ratio of 97.6%), indicating the absence of a food effect. In the fasted condition, 89.8% of solriamfetol was recovered in urine as unchanged drug over 48 h; 1.1% was excreted as a minor metabolite, N-acetyl solriamfetol. A total of 55 adverse events (AEs), all mild, were reported by 18 subjects (56.3%). The frequency and type of AEs were similar in the 2 conditions; the most common AEs (insomnia, headache, hypervigilance, decreased appetite, and nausea) were all mild in severity and resolved without treatment.

Implications

Solriamfetol relative bioavailability was bioequivalent in the fed and fasted conditions, showing that solriamfetol can be taken without regard to meals; furthermore, tolerability was similar in both conditions. Renal excretion of unchanged drug is the primary route of elimination.

Cholinesterase inhibitors — tacrine for mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease has been extensively studied, with at least five double-blind placebo-controlled trials including a total of more than 2,000 patients; approximately 30%–40% of tacrine-treated completers showed modest cognitive and functional improvements over study periods ranging from 6 to 30 weeks versus up to 10% on placebo, with response related to tolerating 120–160 mg/day. Modest improvement corresponded to maintaining or improving function by an amount typically lost over 6 months, but only approximately 60% completed trials even at moderate doses; 30% were dropped for elevations in hepatic transaminases and another 10% left due to other adverse effects, and benefits and adverse effects beyond 30 weeks are unknown.

### Indirect treatment comparison of solriamfetol, modafinil, and armodafinil for excessive daytime sleepiness in obstructive sleep apnea [^4dd2f105]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Study Objectives

Excessive daytime sleepiness associated with obstructive sleep apnea affects 9%-22% of continuous positive airway pressure-treated patients. An indirect treatment comparison meta-analysis was performed to compare efficacy and safety of medications (solriamfetol, modafinil, and armodafinil) approved to treat excessive daytime sleepiness associated with obstructive sleep apnea.

Methods

Efficacy and safety measures assessed in this indirect treatment comparison included Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), 20-minute Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT20), Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGI-C), Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire (FOSQ), and incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (any, serious, or leading to discontinuation).

Results

A systematic literature review identified 6 parallel-arm, placebo-controlled randomized controlled trials that randomized 1,714 total participants to placebo, solriamfetol, modafinil, or armodafinil. In this indirect treatment comparison, all comparators were associated with greater improvements than placebo on the ESS, MWT20, and CGI-C after 4, 8, and 12 weeks of treatment. Relative to comparators and placebo at 12 weeks, solriamfetol at 150mg or 300mg had the highest probabilities of improvement in the ESS, MWT20, and CGI-C. Modafinil (200 or 400mg) and solriamfetol (150 or 300mg) were associated with greater improvement on the FOSQ than placebo at 12 weeks. Less than 2% of patients using placebo or comparators experienced serious or discontinuation-related treatment-emergent adverse events.

Conclusions

The results of this indirect treatment comparison show 12 weeks of treatment with solriamfetol, modafinil, and armodafinil resulted in varying levels of improvement on the ESS, MWT20, and CGI-C and similar safety risks in participants with excessive daytime sleepiness associated with obstructive sleep apnea.

### A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study to evaluate the human abuse liability of solriamfetol, a selective dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor [^6f104bac]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2018). Low credibility.

There were no serious adverse events after administration with solriamfetol despite inclusion of supratherapeutic doses of 600 and 1200 mg, of which the latter is approximately four times the highest planned therapeutic dose and is the highest dose that has been studied in humans. The safety profile of solriamfetol in this study was consistent with that observed in previous studies. However, the highest overall rate of TEAEs with solriamfetol was in the group that received 1200 mg (> 95%), the mean increase in HR was > 20 beats/min, and there were two study discontinuations, for nervousness and increased BP, neither of which was serious, that occurred with solriamfetol 1200 mg, indicating that this dose is likely the highest dose that would have been tolerated. The lowest dose of solriamfetol, 300 mg, is the highest of the planned therapeutic doses. With regard to BP, substantial differences were observed between phentermine and solriamfetol, with phentermine resulting in greater increases in both systolic and diastolic BP at supratherapeutic doses. These effects provide support that solriamfetol may have pharmacodynamic properties different from those of traditional stimulants. The most commonly reported TEAEs were consistent with the wake-promoting profile as well as with what has been reported in phase 2 clinical trials of solriamfetol for the treatment of narcolepsy.

Strengths and limitations

This study was consistent with FDA guidance for abuse potential assessment, including use of recommended scales. However, there are several limitations, including that African Americans were over-represented in the study population compared with National Survey on Drug Use and Health estimates of the demographics of stimulant users, although this is not expected to affect the conclusions. This study was not powered to evaluate differences by subgroups such as race or sex, but there were no apparent trends by these demographic subgroups. Another limitation is that the two-day washout was shorter than five half-lives for phentermine, although data such as those in Figure 2 suggest that subjective effect ratings returned to baseline at pre-dose. Pharmacokinetic data were not collected in this study, which precludes the evaluation of any within-study pharmacokinetic–pharmacodynamic analyses. Finally, approximately half of the participants had a positive cannabinoid drug screen at check-in to the residential research unit; however, recent cannabinoid use did not appear to have affected the pre-dose baseline ratings.

Since ratings of Overall Drug Liking at 24 h for the two higher doses of solriamfetol (600 and 1200 mg) were not significantly different from placebo, a post hoc analysis was conducted in which the primary and key secondary endpoints were summarized for solriamfetol 1200 mg based on whether participants reported next day overall liking (rating > 50; n = 18) or disliking (rating ≤ 50; n = 19) on the Overall Drug Liking scale at 24 h. For approximately half of the participants who reported next day liking of solriamfetol 1200 mg, none of the other primary and key secondary measures were numerically higher for solriamfetol 1200 mg compared with phentermine 90 mg. For approximately half of the participants who did not report next day liking for solriamfetol 1200 mg, all of the other primary and key secondary measures were markedly lower for solriamfetol 1200 mg compared with phentermine 90 mg. For example, mean (SE) ratings for solriamfetol 1200 mg vs. phentermine 90 mg were, respectively, 75.3 (3.9) vs. 84.8 (3.0) for Drug Liking at the Moment (E max); 27.3 (4.9) vs. 62.7 (6.2) for Overall Drug Liking at 24 h; and 10.1 (5.8) vs. 42.1 (8.8) for Next Day Take Drug Again.

Parkinson's disease dementia — rivastigmine randomized and extension studies: In a 24-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study with 541 subjects, 3–12 mg/day of rivastigmine improved cognition and function compared with placebo and was tolerated. In a 48-week open-label active treatment extension (3–12 mg/day) that included 334 subjects from the prior study, cognitive and functional benefits appeared to continue over time, and patients initially on placebo who then received rivastigmine showed improvements similar to those who received rivastigmine initially.

### Controversies in hypertension therapy: bedtime dosing or daytime dosing? [^3203c883]. Journal of Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

In managing frailty and hypertension, the timing of antihypertensive medication administration is crucial and should account for both BP rhythms and comorbidities. For extreme dippers, nighttime administration of antihypertensive medications may exacerbate excessive nocturnal BP reduction, increasing the risk of cerebral hypoperfusion and cognitive decline. In such cases, morning dosing is recommended. On the other hand, for patients with nondipper or reverse-dipper BP patterns and concomitant nocturnal hypertension, bedtime dosing may help restore a dipper BP pattern and reduce cardiovascular risk. In addition to pharmacological therapy, integrating non-pharmacological interventions, such as physical activity and nutritional support, is essential for improving overall health in frail patients. For example, the SPRINTT trial demonstrated that multicomponent interventions, including resistance training and protein supplementation, significantly improved mobility and reduced frailty in older adults, indirectly supporting better BP control and cardiovascular health. In conclusion, the management of hypertension in frail older adults requires an individualized and multidimensional approach. ABPM plays a pivotal role in providing the critical data needed to guide personalized treatment decisions. Combining-arginine supplementation and other adjunctive therapies with lifestyle interventions may further enhance cognitive and physical health outcomes, ultimately improving the quality of life for this vulnerable population.
