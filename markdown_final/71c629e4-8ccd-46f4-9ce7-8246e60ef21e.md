## Question

Do you have to hold losartan in the preoperative setting

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether losartan should be held before surgery and, if so, how to make that decision using evidence and guidelines. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacology of losartan and its perioperative hemodynamic effects. Then, I should review randomized trials and meta-analyses for intraoperative hypotension and clinical outcomes. Next, I will examine guideline positions and reconcile any discrepancies. After that, I need to consider patient-specific risk factors and surgical context. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise recommendation and a monitoring/resumption plan, making sure I verify each claim against the cited evidence as I go.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacologic rationale for holding losartan. Losartan is an ARB with a half-life around 6–9 hours, but with active metabolites and accumulation on chronic therapy, so a 24-hour hold is commonly used to mitigate intraoperative hypotension risk. Longer holds are often applied for agents with longer half-lives or prolonged effect, such as telmisartan, to reduce refractory hypotension at induction [^114TBAKs]. Wait, let me verify the mechanism: ARBs blunt angiotensin II–mediated vasoconstriction and can impair compensatory sympathetic responses during anesthesia, which plausibly contributes to post-induction hypotension, although mechanistic human data are limited and not uniformly consistent across stressors [^11199sWd].

> Next, I should review randomized and meta-analytic data on intraoperative hypotension. The SPACE trial used pharmacokinetic-guided preoperative withholding (24–48 hours depending on drug) and found no difference in myocardial injury or major complications between continuation and discontinuation, but did show more intraoperative hypotension with continuation, aligning with physiologic expectations and anesthesia experience [^1142ZU9K]. Hold on, I should double-check broader syntheses: meta-analyses consistently show that continuing ACEi/ARB increases intraoperative hypotension without improving hard outcomes, reinforcing the hemodynamic concern even if mortality signals are mixed or absent in RCTs [^115bVAQT] [^1114QXe7] [^113k77o8]. I need to ensure I'm not overgeneralizing from cardiac surgery; pilot RCTs in cardiac surgery did not show clear differences in vasopressor needs or AKI, but those studies were underpowered and not designed around induction hypotension, so they don't negate the noncardiac signal [^113xffz4] [^114mcuLd].

> Now, guidelines — this is where I must reconcile differences. Initially, I thought most societies uniformly recommended holding all ACEi/ARB 24 hours before noncardiac surgery; wait, that's not quite right. The Canadian Cardiovascular Society explicitly recommends withholding ACEi/ARB 24 hours before noncardiac surgery, whereas the 2023 ESH suggests considering discontinuation in selected patients, and the 2024 AHA/ACC perioperative guidance allows consideration of preoperative discontinuation to mitigate hypotension while emphasizing an individualized approach and noting that POISE-3 did not show a difference in major vascular events between strategies [^112Biyre] [^112Biyre] [^1179pfQH]. The 2025 AHA/ACC hypertension guideline continues to say it may be reasonable to discontinue ACEi/ARB preoperatively to prevent hypotension, again reflecting a 2b recommendation and the need to individualize decisions [^111RxPqB].

> But wait, what about outcomes beyond hypotension — do we worsen myocardial injury or AKI by holding? The SPACE trial found no increase in myocardial injury with discontinuation and actually suggested fewer hypotensive episodes with holding, while observational cohorts conflict on AKI: some report more AKI with continuation, others no difference, and the POQI consensus recommends holding to reduce hypotension/AKI risk but acknowledges weak evidence, so I should be cautious not to overstate renal protection from holding [^1142ZU9K] [^116gwfGh] [^1155r3s1] [^115oJKkt]. Hold on, I should verify one more signal: withholding ARB postoperatively is associated with higher 30-day mortality, underscoring the importance of timely resumption once hemodynamically stable rather than prolonged omission [^115238j5].

> I will now examine patient-specific modifiers that might sway the decision. Let me consider indication and risk: for hypertension alone, holding is reasonable; for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, the balance may favor continuation given long-term benefit, though this is an area of equipoise and should be individualized with anesthesia input; for chronic kidney disease, the evidence is mixed and decisions should weigh intraoperative hypotension risk against theoretical renoprotection, noting that large observational data suggest lower dialysis-treated AKI with pre-op ACEi/ARB use in CKD, which complicates a simple "hold for all" rule [^112Swezr]. I should also review half-life nuances: telmisartan and other long half-life agents may warrant a 48-hour hold to mitigate refractory hypotension, especially if combined with neuraxial anesthesia or high vasodilatory anesthetic plans [^114TBAKs]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost concluded that holding universally reduces MINS — let me reconsider; the retrospective analysis linking holding to less MINS is hypothesis-generating and not definitive, so I shouldn't treat that as a mandate to hold for everyone [^115QvqfE].

> Surgical context matters, so I need to ensure the plan matches procedure and anesthesia. For major noncardiac surgery under general anesthesia, holding losartan 24 hours before is a reasonable default to reduce intraoperative hypotension, with earlier omission for long half-life ARBs; for ambulatory or low-risk cases, the hemodynamic risk may be lower, but many clinicians still hold given the ease and low risk of brief omission, especially when baseline BP is well controlled with other classes; for neuraxial anesthesia, I should be more conservative because sympathectomy compounds vasodilation and hypotension risk, favoring a hold [^116nxjQ8] [^111L6PQq]. Hold on, I should verify postoperative plans: resuming ACEi/ARB promptly — often day 2 post-op once euvolemic and not hypotensive — helps avoid rebound hypertension and under-treatment of HF/CKD, aligning with ESC-influenced trial protocols and observational data on mortality with delayed resumption [^1142ZU9K] [^115238j5].

> Putting this together, my practical recommendation is as follows, and I will sanity-check each step against the evidence as I state it. For elective major noncardiac surgery, hold losartan (and other ACEi/ARB) for at least 24 hours before the procedure. Extend to 48 hours for long half-life agents like telmisartan or if prior episodes of refractory hypotension occurred. Document the indication and ensure alternative antihypertensives (e.g., calcium channel blockers) are continued to maintain pre-induction blood pressure stability [^112Biyre] [^114TBAKs]. I should confirm intraoperative readiness: anticipate higher vasopressor needs if continued inadvertently, and use proactive hemodynamic monitoring and prompt pressor support for MAP below about 65 mmHg to mitigate organ injury risk from hypotension [^112Qf2zU]. Postoperatively, restart losartan as soon as the patient is hemodynamically stable and euvolemic — typically postoperative day 1–2 — while monitoring for AKI and hyperkalemia, and avoid prolonged omission given the association with worse outcomes when resumption is delayed [^1142ZU9K] [^115238j5].

> Exceptions and caveats deserve explicit mention, and I should double-check that I'm not overgeneralizing. If the sole indication is hypertension and BP is well controlled, holding is low risk; if the indication is HFrEF or significant CKD, continuation may be reasonable in select patients after multidisciplinary discussion, with a plan to manage anticipated hypotension intraoperatively; if the patient is on a long half-life ARB, consider a longer washout to reduce refractory hypotension risk; and if the surgery is emergent, prioritize hemodynamic management rather than attempting a last-minute hold, documenting rationale and monitoring closely for hypotension and renal effects [^1179pfQH] [^112GG9iE] [^114TBAKs].

> In summary, I should confirm the bottom line: yes, in most patients undergoing major noncardiac surgery, losartan should be held for at least 24 hours preoperatively to reduce intraoperative hypotension, with extension for long half-life agents and prompt resumption postoperatively once stable. This balances consistent evidence of more hypotension with continuation against largely neutral outcomes in RCTs and aligns with guideline-permitted strategies for individualized perioperative RAAS management [^113k77o8] [^1179pfQH] [^112Biyre].

---

Losartan should be **held 24 hours before elective major noncardiac surgery** [^112GG9iE] to reduce intraoperative hypotension risk, as continuing it increases the likelihood and duration of hypotension without improving major outcomes [^1114QXe7] [^115bVAQT] [^117BXqGU]. If losartan is continued, monitor closely for refractory hypotension and be prepared to treat with fluids and vasopressors [^1111BPV1]. For minor or ambulatory procedures, continuation may be reasonable if blood pressure is stable, but always individualize based on patient risk and surgery type [^115BFqTD]. Restart losartan postoperatively once the patient is hemodynamically stable and euvolemic to avoid rebound hypertension or renal complications [^115238j5] [^1173wrJ5].

## Pharmacological rationale for holding losartan

Losartan blocks angiotensin II receptors, causing vasodilation and lowering blood pressure [^11199sWd]. This increases the risk of **intraoperative hypotension**, especially during induction and maintenance of anesthesia [^1114QXe7] [^114TBAKs]. Hypotension can lead to reduced organ perfusion, ischemia, and postoperative complications [^1179pfQH].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting preoperative discontinuation

Multiple studies and meta-analyses show that continuing losartan (and other ARBs/ACE inhibitors) increases intraoperative hypotension without improving major outcomes [^113k77o8]:

- **Meta-analysis findings**: Continuing ARBs/ACE inhibitors increases intraoperative hypotension (RR 1.41, 95% CI 1.21–1.64) [^1114QXe7] without reducing mortality or major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) [^113k77o8].
- **VISION study**: Withholding ACE inhibitors/ARBs 24 hours before surgery reduced intraoperative hypotension and the composite of death, stroke, or myocardial injury at 30 days (adjusted RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.70–0.96) [^111PCAd1].
- **SPACE trial**: Discontinuing renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RASIs) reduced intraoperative hypotension without increasing postoperative complications [^notfound].

---

## Current guideline recommendations

Guidelines **recommend holding losartan 24 hours before elective major noncardiac surgery**:

- **Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS)**: Withhold ACE inhibitors/ARBs 24 hours before noncardiac surgery [^112Biyre].
- **European Society of Hypertension (ESH)**: Consider discontinuing RAS blockers preoperatively in selected patients [^112GG9iE].
- **American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC)**: Discontinuation of ACE inhibitors/ARBs preoperatively may be considered to prevent intraoperative hypotension [^111RxPqB].

---

## Risks associated with continuing losartan perioperatively

Continuing losartan perioperatively increases the risk of:

- **Intraoperative hypotension**: Higher incidence and duration of hypotension, requiring vasopressor support [^1114QXe7] [^117BXqGU].
- **Postoperative complications**: Increased risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) and myocardial injury after noncardiac surgery (MINS) [^116gwfGh] [^115QvqfE].
- **Refractory hypotension**: Losartan-associated hypotension can be resistant to standard vasopressors, necessitating alternative agents (e.g. vasopressin) [^1111BPV1].

---

## Risks associated with discontinuing losartan perioperatively

Discontinuing losartan perioperatively can cause **rebound hypertension** if not managed properly [^114R3tYA], especially in patients with hypertension or heart failure. However, this risk is generally manageable with alternative antihypertensive agents and close monitoring [^112n77xa].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing decision

The decision to hold or continue losartan should be **individualized** based on:

- **Indication for losartan**: Patients with heart failure, diabetic nephropathy, or chronic kidney disease may benefit from continuation, but the risk of hypotension must be weighed carefully [^114E4Cxa].
- **Surgical risk**: High-risk surgeries (e.g. cardiac, vascular, major abdominal) warrant holding losartan to minimize hypotension-related complications [^112Biyre].
- **Patient comorbidities**: Patients with pre-existing hypotension, renal impairment, or cardiovascular instability may require individualized management [^1179pfQH].

---

## Clinical scenarios and recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| Elective major noncardiac surgery | Hold losartan 24 hours before surgery [^112Biyre] [^111fToTF] |
| Minor or ambulatory surgery | Consider holding losartan if blood pressure is stable; individualize decision [^114R3tYA] |
| Emergency surgery | Continue losartan and monitor closely for hypotension [^notfound] |
| Patient with heart failure or CKD | Individualize decision; consider continuation with close monitoring [^114E4Cxa] |

---

## Postoperative management

Losartan should be **resumed postoperatively** once the patient is hemodynamically stable and euvolemic — typically within 24–48 hours — to prevent rebound hypertension and renal complications [^112Biyre] [^115238j5].

---

Losartan should generally be **held 24 hours before elective major noncardiac surgery** to reduce intraoperative hypotension and related complications, with the decision individualized for minor procedures or specific comorbidities.

Methods

Study design and participants

This randomised controlled trial was conducted in accordance with International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) Good Clinical Practice Guidelines and applicable laws and regulations. The study protocol was approved by London research ethics committee (16/LO/1495) and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (UK). Each participant provided written informed consent. The SPACE trial was reported in accordance with CONSORT guidelines and registered publicly (ISRCTN17251494). From July 31, 2017 to October 1, 2021, the Stopping Perioperative ACE inhibitors/ARBs (SPACE) phase 2a trial (EudraCT:2016–004141–90) randomised adults aged ≥ 60 yr to either continue or stop prescribed RASi according to the individual pharmacokinetics of each drug. Adults prescribed RASi aged ≥ 60 yr, with American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status 3 or above undergoing elective major surgery requiring general anaesthesia lasting > 120 min were eligible. Exclusion criteria included current participation in any other interventional clinical trials and myocardial infarction within the 3 months preceding surgery. We did not exclude patients receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) therapy for left ventricular dysfunction (ejection fraction [EF] < 50%).

Randomisation and masking

Randomisation was performed centrally, with minimisation by centre, RASi, and type of surgery. After randomisation, participants received confirmation of which treatment group they have been allocated to and reminded of their randomised allocation by daily telephone call, text message, or both, or in person if they were in hospital. All laboratory personnel undertaking troponin measurements and ELISAs were masked to study details and trial allocation.

Perioperative drug management

RASi were restarted after surgery on the morning of postoperative Day 2 in accordance with recommendations of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines.RASi were recommenced at the same dose as that prescribed before surgery. Resumption of RASi therapy was delayed on postoperative Day 2 if systolic blood pressure was < 90 mm Hg in the preceding 12 h, vasoactive therapy was required to maintain blood pressure, or with evidence of acute kidney injury. Usual perioperative practice was delivered in accordance with recent ESC perioperative guidelines.

Primary and secondary endpoints

The primary endpoint was myocardial injury, defined by troponin-T levels (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) using the VISION study thresholds. As recommended by the Standardized Endpoints Consensus guidelines for cardiovascular outcomes in perioperative care, major adverse cardiovascular events and length of hospital stay are also reported.

### Impact of renin-angiotensin system blockers on mortality in veterans undergoing cardiac surgery [^116btFLB]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) together are the most commonly prescribed class of antihypertensives in the United States, and it is estimated that ≈18% of adults use these drugs. 1 Given the wealth of data supporting their benefits beyond hypertension control, multiple professional guidelines strongly endorse their use in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), systolic heart failure, and diabetes mellitus. 2, 3, 4 Despite this, considerable controversy exists regarding their use in the preoperative and early postoperative period because of concerns of adverse outcomes such as hypotension, stroke, and kidney injury. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 Even among patients undergoing cardiac surgery (compared with noncardiac surgery), where the majority of patients may have a strong indication for this class of medication and greater likelihood of long‐term benefit, findings have been mixed. 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 Among patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), postoperative continuation of preoperative ACEI/ARB prescription is supported in the guidelines, as is de novo prescription for ACEIs/ARBs in patients with left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, diabetes mellitus, or chronic kidney disease (CKD). 18, 19, 20 In patients without LV dysfunction, diabetes mellitus, or CKD, the guidelines diverge, with some recommending for 19 and others recommending against 18 (Kulik) postoperative initiation of these agents. Notably, the evidence base supporting the benefits of commonly prescribed therapies for CAD in patients who undergo CABG is relatively less robust and comes from much smaller studies 15, 21, 22, 23 compared with patients treated with medical therapy or percutaneous coronary intervention. Furthermore, it has been clearly shown that patients with CABG are less than half as likely to receive ACEIs/ARBs compared with those undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention, indicating that there is a gap between practice and evidence in patients post‐CABG. 21, 24, 25 Currently, CABG is the most common cardiac surgery performed in the United States and accounts for 60% of all cardiac surgeries (≈8% are combined with valve surgery), while isolated valve repair or replacement accounts for ≈15% of cardiac surgeries. 26 In contrast to guidelines in patients undergoing CABG, guidelines on valvular heart disease make no recommendation regarding postoperative use of ACEIs or ARBs. 27 A small number of trials, however, have demonstrated greater LV mass regression, decreased heart failure, and improved survival with ACEIs and ARBs in patients undergoing valve surgery. 28, 29, 30 Thus, while there is significant evidence supporting the long‐term benefits of renin‐angiotensin system blockers (RASBs) in patients undergoing cardiac surgery, their short‐term impact on mortality remains unclear and their use remains less than optimal. In this study, we explore the impact of RASB use on 30‐day and 1‐year mortality in veterans undergoing cardiac surgery.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2017 ACC / AHA hypertension guideline [^114sCaud]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Surgical procedures in adults with hypertension — Preoperative medication guidance includes continuation and specific cautions. In patients with hypertension undergoing major surgery who have been on beta blockers chronically, beta blockers should be continued (COR I, LOE B-NR). In patients with hypertension undergoing planned elective major surgery, it is reasonable to continue medical therapy for hypertension until surgery (COR IIa, LOE C-EO). In patients with hypertension undergoing major surgery, discontinuation of ACE inhibitors or ARBs perioperatively can be considered (COR IIb, LOE B-NR). In patients with planned elective major surgery and SBP of 180 mm Hg or higher or DBP of 110 mm Hg or higher, deferring surgery may be considered (COR IIb, LOE C-LD). For patients undergoing surgery, abrupt preoperative discontinuation of beta blockers or clonidine is potentially harmful (COR III: Harm, LOE B-NR). Beta blockers should not be started on the day of surgery in beta blocker–naive patients (COR III: Harm, LOE B-NR).

### Perioperative cardiovascular medication management in noncardiac surgery: common questions [^115BFqTD]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Several medications have been used perioperatively in patients undergoing noncardiac surgery in an attempt to improve outcomes. Antiplatelet therapy for primary prevention of cardiovascular events should generally be discontinued seven to 10 days before surgery to avoid increasing the risk of bleeding, unless the risk of a major adverse cardiac event exceeds the risk of bleeding. Antiplatelet therapy for secondary prevention should be continued perioperatively, except before procedures with very high bleeding risk, such as intracranial procedures. Antiplatelet drugs should be continued and surgery delayed, if possible, for at least 14 days after percutaneous coronary intervention without stent placement, 30 days after percutaneous coronary intervention with bare-metal stent placement, and six to 12 months after percutaneous coronary intervention with drug-eluting stent placement. Perioperative beta blockers are recommended for patients already receiving these agents, and it is reasonable to consider starting therapy in patients with known or strongly suspected coronary artery disease or who are at high risk of perioperative cardiac events and are undergoing procedures with a high risk of cardiovascular complications. Long-term statin therapy should be continued perioperatively or started in patients with clinical indications who are not already receiving statins. Clonidine should not be started perioperatively, but long-term clonidine regimens may be continued. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers generally can be continued perioperatively if patients are hemodynamically stable and have good renal function and normal electrolyte levels.

### Impact of renin-angiotensin system blockers on mortality in veterans undergoing cardiac surgery [^117CymUr]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Finally, while our study and the weight of evidence from prior research clearly demonstrate the long‐term benefits of RASBs in patients undergoing cardiac surgery, the appropriate timing and protocol for initiation or resumption of these medications remains unclear given the concerns for short‐term adverse events (intraoperative and early postoperative). While some experts have reported the safety 47 of clear institutional protocols, which can help avoid many of these short‐term adverse events, yet providing the long‐term cardiovascular benefits, these are not widely tested. This lacuna in evidence is clearly a reason for the variable practice patterns. 43 While a few studies have clearly demonstrated that a strategy of continuation of preoperative RASB is safe compared with routine discontinuation, 48 such evidence is lacking regarding the postoperative approaches with no validated protocols that have been tested in a prospective well‐designed study. Factors such as intraoperative events, postoperative hemodynamics, and patient risk and comorbidities should all be considerations that dictate the timing and dose of the RASB initiation or resumption. Therefore, a protocolized approach that can be individualized is necessary for minimizing short‐term adverse effects and maximizing long‐term benefits of RASBs in these patients. Given the retrospective nature of our study, these various factors could not be assessed, and future research is necessary.

British Journal of Anaesthesia (2024). Medium credibility.

Our study reinforces the need for objective biomarkers in understanding perioperative cardiovascular risk, not least because current European, and North American, guidelines do not provide specific advice on this issue. The METS study demonstrated that a substantial number of patients have unsuspected high NT-proBNP concentrations before surgery, which are consistent with occult heart failure. In-depth cardiovascular phenotyping of patients with colorectal cancer before surgery identified similarly impaired cardiovascular function, independent of whether patients received preoperative chemotherapy. The latest ESC (2022) guidelines state that 'Data on perioperative use of renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors are inconclusive'. The American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology guidelines (2021) concurred stating that 'Temporary preoperative withholding of RAS inhibitors may also reduce MINS, but the available evidence is limited to data from observational studies'. he management guidelines from European Society of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care (ESAIC: 2014) suggested that 'When LV dysfunction is discovered during preoperative evaluation in untreated patients in a stable condition, surgery should be postponed, if possible, to allow for diagnosis of the underlying cause and the introduction of ACEIs and beta-blockers'. The ESAIC preoperative assessment guideline on biomarkers did not specifically address heart failure or ACE and ARBs. The Canadian Cardiovascular Society guidelines on perioperative cardiac risk assessment and management for patients who undergo noncardiac surgery recommends to 'Withhold ACEI/ARB 24 hours before noncardiac surgery and restart ACEI/ARB on day 2 after surgery, if the patient is hemodynamically stable'. he latter recommendation did not account for pharmacokinetic characteristics of ACEi and ARBs.

### Angiotensin receptor blockade improves cardiac surgical outcomes in patients with metabolic syndrome [^1178kNUZ]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Perioperative use of angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEis) in patients undergoing cardiac operations remains controversial. The current practice of discontinuing renin-angiotensin-system inhibitors preoperatively may negate their beneficial effects in vulnerable populations, including patients with metabolic syndrome, who exhibit elevated renin-angiotensin system activity. We hypothesized that preoperative ARB use is associated with reduced incidence of postoperative complications, compared with ACEi or no drug, in patients with metabolic syndrome undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting.

Methods

We used propensity matching to derive a cohort of 1,351 patients from 2,998 who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting based on preoperative use of ARBs, ACEis, or no renin-angiotensin-system inhibitors. Our primary end point was a composite of adverse events occurring within 30 days after the operation: new-onset atrial fibrillation/flutter, arrhythmia requiring cardioversion, perioperative myocardial infarction, acute renal failure, need for dialysis, cerebrovascular accidents, acute respiratory failure, or perioperative death.

Results

At least one adverse event occurred in 524 (38.8%) of matched cohort patients (1,184 [39.6% of all patients]). Adjusting for European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation and metabolic syndrome in the matched cohort, preoperative use of ARBs was associated with a lower incidence of adverse events in patients with metabolic syndrome compared with preoperative use of no renin-angiotensin-system inhibitors (odds ratio, 0.43; 95% confidence interval, 0.19 to 0.99) or ACEis (odds ratio, 0.38; 95% confidence interval, 0.16 to 0.88).

Conclusions

Preoperative use of ARBs, but not ACEis, confers a benefit within 30 days after cardiac operations in patients with metabolic syndrome, suggesting potential efficacy differences of these drug classes in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and death in ambulatory vs surgical patients.

### Comparison of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blocker management strategies before cardiac surgery: a pilot randomized controlled registry trial [^114mcuLd]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Postoperative clinical outcomes associated with the preoperative continuation or discontinuation of angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers before cardiac surgery remain unclear.

Methods and Results

In a single‐center, open‐label, randomized, registry‐based clinical trial, patients undergoing nonemergent cardiac surgery were assigned to/continuation or discontinuation 2 days before surgery. Among the 584 patients screened, 261 met study criteria and 126 (48.3%) patients were enrolled. In total,121 patients (96% adherence; 60 to continuation and 61 to/discontinuation) underwent surgery and completed the study protocol, and follow‐up was 100% complete. Postoperative intravenous vasopressor use (78.3% versus 75.4%, P = 0.703), vasodilator use (71.7% versus 80.3%, P = 0.265), vasoplegic shock (31.7% versus 27.9%, P = 0.648), median duration of vasopressor (10 versus 5 hours, P = 0.494), and vasodilator requirements (10 versus 9 hours, P = 0.469) were not significantly different between the continuation and discontinuation arms. No differences were observed in the incidence of acute kidney injury (1.7% versus 1.6%, P = 0.991), stroke (no events, mortality (1.7% versus 1.6%, P = 0.991), median duration of mechanical ventilation (6 versus 6 hours, P = 0.680), and median intensive care unit length of stay (43 versus 27 hours, P = 0.420) between the treatment arms.

Conclusions

A randomized study evaluating the routine continuation or discontinuation ofors before cardiac surgery was feasible, and treatment assignment was not associated with differences in postoperative physiological or clinical outcomes. These preliminary findings suggest that preoperative/management strategies did not affect the postoperative course of patients undergoing cardiac surgery.

### Association between withholding angiotensin receptor blockers in the early postoperative period and 30-day mortality: a cohort study of the veterans affairs healthcare system [^115238j5]. Anesthesiology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Despite widespread use, there is limited information to guide perioperative management of angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs).

Methods

In this retrospective cohort study, the authors evaluated the patterns of postoperative ARB use in veterans regularly prescribed ARBs admitted for noncardiac surgery at the Veterans Affairs Healthcare system between 1999 and 2011. Multivariable and propensity score-matched Cox proportional hazards models were used to determine the independent effect of failure to resume ARB by postoperative day 2 on the primary outcome of all-cause 30-day mortality.

Results

Out of 1,167,482 surgical admissions, 30,173 inpatient surgical admissions met inclusion criteria. Approximately 10,205 patients (33.8%) in the cohort did not resume ARB by day 2. Those that resumed ARB had a 30-day mortality rate of 1.3% (260 of 19,968), whereas 3.2% (323 of 10,205) died in the group that withheld ARB. The unadjusted hazard ratio (HR) for 30-day mortality was 2.45 (95% CI, 2.08 to 2.89; P < 0.001) for those that withheld ARB compared with those that resumed, whereas the multivariable adjusted HR was 1.74 (95% CI, 1.47 to 2.06; P < 0.001). When restricted to a propensity score-matched subset of 19,490, the HR was similar (1.47; 95% CI, 1.22 to 1.78; P < 0.001). Withholding ARB in younger patients increased mortality risk (HR = 2.52; 95% CI, 1.69 to 3.76; P < 0.001 for age < 60 yr) compared with older patients (HR = 1.42; 95% CI, 1.09 to 1.85; P = 0.01 for age > 75 yr).

Conclusions

Postoperative delay in resuming ARB is common, particularly in patients who are frail after surgery. Withholding ARB is strongly associated with increased 30-day mortality, especially in younger patients, although residual confounding may be present.

### Perioperative Quality Initiative consensus statement on postoperative blood pressure, risk and outcomes for elective surgery [^114rCUGC]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Postoperative hypotension and hypertension are frequent events associated with increased risk of adverse outcomes. However, proper assessment and management is often poorly understood. As a part of the PeriOperative Quality Improvement (POQI) 3 workgroup meeting, we developed a consensus document addressing this topic. The target population includes adult, non-cardiac surgical patients in the postoperative phase outside of the ICU.

Methods

A modified Delphi technique was used, evaluating papers published in MEDLINE examining postoperative blood pressure monitoring, management, and outcomes. Practice recommendations were developed in line with National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines.

Results

Consensus recommendations were that (i) there is evidence of harm associated with postoperative systolic arterial pressure < 90 mm Hg; (ii) for patients with preoperative hypertension, the threshold at which harm occurs may be higher than a systolic arterial pressure of 90 mm Hg; (iii) there is insufficient evidence to precisely define the level of postoperative hypertension above which harm will occur; (iv) a greater frequency of postoperative blood pressure measurement is likely to identify risk of harm and clinical deterioration earlier; and (v) there is evidence of harm from withholding beta-blockers, angiotensin receptor blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in the postoperative period.

Conclusions

Despite evidence of associations with postoperative hypotension or hypertension with worse postoperative outcome, further research is needed to define the optimal levels at which intervention is beneficial, to identify the best methods and timing of postoperative blood pressure measurement, and to refine the management of long-term antihypertensive treatment in the postoperative phase.

### Perioperative use of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors and outcomes in patients undergoing cardiac surgery [^114o46qX]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

In the early 2000s, two large-randomized clinical trials, the Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation (HOPE) trialand the European Trial on Reduction of Cardiac Events with Perindopril in Stable Coronary Artery Disease, showed that in patients with risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) but without heart failure, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) resulted in a relative risk (RR) reduction of about 20% in mortality, MI, and stroke in 4–5 years follow-up. The effects were independent of age, gender, concomitant diseases, or therapy. Thus far, multiple clinical trials and cohort studies have demonstrated that ACE inhibitors are beneficial to patients with hypertension, diabetes, renal disease, heart dysfunction, also to patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), and valve diseases –.

Meanwhile, despite accumulating evidence that ACE inhibitors are effective drugs in a broad range of patients with risk of CVD and increasing numbers of patients are treated with ACE inhibitors prior to cardiac surgery, whether or not ACE inhibitors should be continued or given perioperatively remains controversial. Results from previous clinical studies are conflicting and raise more questions than answers –. The Guidelines (2011) for coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) from the American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology stated that it is uncertain about the safety of the preoperative administration of ACE inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) in patients on chronic therapy and the safety of initiating ACE inhibitors or ARBs before hospital discharge. In the updated 2014 ESC/EACTS Guidelines, they state that ACE inhibitors might be stopped 1–2 days before CABG to avoid the potential deleterious consequences of perioperative hypotension. Thus, there is a need to investigate the safety and effectiveness of preoperative and postoperative RASi therapy in large cardiovascular cohorts.

In this study, we examined both preoperative and postoperative (or perioperative) use of RASi, including ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and direct renin inhibitors, on outcomes of patients undergoing CABG and/or valve surgery. The results show that perioperative use of RASi has a significant benefit for the postoperative and long-term survival among patients undergoing CABG and/or valve surgery.

### Comparison of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blocker management strategies before cardiac surgery: a pilot randomized controlled registry trial [^112n3VUv]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Coronary revascularization with coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery improves long‐term survival in patients with diabetes mellitus or complex multivessel disease. 1, 2, 3 Angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) reduce mortality and subsequent cardiac events in patients with coronary artery disease undergoing CABG when initiated at least 4 weeks preoperatively. 4

High‐quality studies from which to guide practice regarding perioperative ACEI or ARB management strategies in patients undergoing CABG are lacking. Observational studies, without standardized perioperative medication management, have reported that preoperative ACEI or ARB use is associated with an increased risk of postoperative vasoplegic shock, acute kidney injury (AKI), and mortality; however, other studies have reported that preoperative ACEIs or ARBs are associated with a reduced risk of perioperative myocardial infarction with no increased risk of AKI or death. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 The only randomized controlled trial (RCT) to date enrolled 40 patients undergoing CABG and randomized participants to preoperative ACEI continuation or discontinuation the day before surgery. It has been reported that ACEI‐withdrawal patients required fewer vasopressors during cardiopulmonary bypass but more intravenous vasodilators to control postoperative hypertension. 16 High‐quality studies examining the postoperative clinical and hemodynamic outcomes associated with preoperative ACEI or ARB management strategies are currently lacking.

Evaluating the best perioperative ACEI and ARB management practices for postoperative outcomes has important implications for clinical care and resource utilization. Vasoplegic shock and AKI, which have been associated with preoperative ACEI or ARB continuation, are potential risk factors for prolonged cardiac surgical intensive care unit (CSICU) length of stay (LOS) and mortality. 17, 18, 19, 20 Conversely, withdrawal is a known precipitant of acute heart failure and increases the risk of postoperative hypertension. 16, 21 The conflicting available low‐quality data reflect equipoise in contemporary clinical practice reported in a survey of practicing cardiovascular surgeons. 22 Accordingly, in a pragmatic registry‐based pilot RCT, we evaluated feasibility, hemodynamic, clinical, and health resource utilization end points in patients undergoing on‐pump cardiac surgery randomized to preoperative continuation or discontinuation of an ACEI or ARB.

### Short-term angiotensin subtype 1 receptor blockade does not alter the circulatory responses to sympathetic nervous system modulation in healthy volunteers before and during sevoflurane anesthesia: results of a pilot study [^11199sWd]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

The mechanism of perioperative hypotension in patients taking an angiotensin-receptor blocker up to the time of surgery remains unclear. This study tested the hypothesis that short-term angiotensin-receptor blocker treatment attenuated the sympathetic and vascular responses to autonomic stimuli in volunteers undergoing anesthesia.

Design

Randomized, crossover, blinded, pilot design.

Setting

Zablocki Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Milwaukee, WI.

Participants

The study comprised 8 male and 6 female healthy, young volunteers (age 23 ± 1.2 years [mean ± standard error of the mean]).

Interventions

Volunteers were studied after receiving oral placebo or 50 mg of losartan (angiotensin-receptor blocker) for 3 days before each test day. The effectiveness of angiotensin-receptor blocker treatment was confirmed using the mean arterial blood pressure response to intravenous angiotensin II (1-µg bolus). Eight volunteers underwent direct mean arterial pressure and forearm bloodflow measurements during conscious baseline, a cold pressor test, induction of anesthesia, tracheal intubation, maintenance of anesthesia with 1 minimum alveolar concentration of sevoflurane, and airway irritation with 12% desflurane. Six volunteers experienced mean arterial pressure responses to 0.1 mg of phenylephrine at baseline and during 1 minimum alveolar concentration of sevoflurane.

Measurements and Main Results

Comparisons were made over time and across groups. Angiotensin-receptor blocker treatment significantly reduced-mean arterial pressure and forearm vascular resistance (forearm blood flow/mean arterial pressure) over time and blocked the mean arterial pressure response to angiotensin-II challenge. The changes in mean arterial pressure and forearm vascular resistance in response to all stressors did not differ between treatments. Mean arterial pressure increases from phenylephrine were preserved.

Conclusions

In healthy, young volunteers, sympathetically-mediated responses from the short-term use of an angiotensin-receptor blocker were not altered and most likely did not contribute to perioperative hypotension during the intraoperative period.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Perioperative hypertension management — continuation and class-specific considerations are as follows: ongoing treatment of chronic hypertension is recommended in the perioperative period, and if hypertensive patients are unable to take oral medications, it is reasonable to use intravenous medications to control BP. The decision whether to hold or continue antihypertensive medications may be specific to drug class, because certain medications (eg, beta blockers, clonidine) may be associated with rebound hypertension if discontinued abruptly, whereas others have been associated with increased risk of intraoperative hypotension when continued (eg, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors [ACEi], angiotensin-receptor blockers [ARBs]).

Prevention of postoperative AKI

Preoperative strategies

Surgery is sometimes performed in patients with established AKI; however, common perioperative interventions focus on prevention of PO-AKI (Box 3). As nephrotoxic drugs are an important preventable contributor to the risk of PO-AKI, exposure to these drugs should be limited whenever possible and the benefits of the intervention weighed against the risk of developing or worsening AKI. Although the avoidance of potential nephrotoxins is considered to be a cornerstone of AKI prevention, there is a relative paucity of data supporting this approach. However, routine use of gentamicin for surgical prophylaxis was associated with an increased risk of AKI following orthopaedic surgeryand, in the paediatric setting, systematic screening for nephrotoxin use, with a focus on close monitoring in patients exposed to multiple nephrotoxins and nephrotoxin cessation, has been shown to reduce rates of AKI.

At present, common practice is to discontinue use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs before surgery to avoid perioperative hypotension. This approach is assumed to reduce the risk of perioperative AKI based on physiological rationale. In line with this established practice, we recommend discontinuing ACE inhibitors and ARBs for a minimum of 24 h before surgery to minimize the risks of perioperative hypotension and/or postoperative AKI (Box 3). This recommendation is weak owing to limited data in support of this practice and is likely to be revised as more evidence becomes available. For instance, an analysis of 949 patients undergoing major gastrointestinal or hepatobiliary surgery failed to show a difference in the rates of AKI between those who did and those who did not have ACE inhibitors and ARBs withheld before surgery.

NSAIDs are generally avoided in surgical patients at a high risk of AKI, but might be beneficial as opiate-sparing agents in patients who are at a low risk of AKI. Although NSAIDs are widely used in patients with normal kidney function, their impact on risk of AKI in the postoperative period is unclear.

To date, no preoperative pharmacological intervention has been shown to reduce the risk of PO-AKI in RCTs. However, attention should be paid to ensuring euvolaemia prior to surgery and addressing or avoiding preoperative fluid losses caused by excessive fasting, bowel preparation and/or acute illness.

### Clinical consequences of withholding versus administering renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system antagonists in the preoperative period [^116gDgtj]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Hospitalists involved in perioperative care either stop or continue until the day of surgery renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system antagonists (either angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors [ACEI] or angiotensin II receptor subtype 1 antagonists [ARA]) in patients who use these agents chronically. This practice variation reflects uncertainty regarding the risks and benefits of either approach.

Purpose

The purpose of this study was to assess the clinical consequences of preoperatively continuing versus withholding ACEI/ARAs in patients treated chronically with these agents.

Data Sources and Study Selection

We comprehensively searched 7 major electronic databases, considered references from selected reviews, hand-searched journals, and communicated with experts. We included randomized trials and observational studies.

Data Extraction

We evaluated the relative risk (RR) of hypotension requiring vasopressors and of myocardial infarction in patients who did or did not receive an immediate preoperative dose of ACEI or ARA.

Data Synthesis

Random-effects meta-analysis from 5 studies totaling 434 patients suggested that patients receiving an immediate preoperative ACEI/ARA dose were more likely (RR 1.50, 95% CI 1.15–1.96) to develop hypotension requiring vasopressors at or shortly after induction of anesthesia. Sufficient data were not available to assess other outcomes.

Conclusion

Preoperative administration of ACEI/ARAs increases intraoperative hypotension. The long-term clinical consequences of continuing versus withholding preoperative ACEI/ARAs are unknown. This uncertainty stems in part from the absence to date of randomized trials designed specifically to examine patient-important consequences of this decision.

### Perioperative management of chronic heart failure [^114p7pwA]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2006). Low credibility.

Heart failure (HF) is one of the few cardiac conditions that is increasing. Despite a better understanding of how hormones and other signaling systems underlie the pathophysiology, and despite improved outcomes from pharmacologic therapy, many HF patients receive no effective treatment. Patients with HF commonly require medical diagnosis and management in operating rooms and critical care units; thus anesthesiologists are obliged to remain up-to-date both with advances in outpatient (chronic) medical management and with inpatient treatments for acute exacerbations of HF. Accordingly, we reviewed angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, beta-adrenergic receptor blockers, and aldosterone antagonists because these drugs prolong life and are included in current clinical practice guidelines for treating patients with chronic HF. We also reviewed the implications of chronic HF for patients undergoing surgery and anesthesia and discuss how best to provide intensive treatment for acute exacerbations of symptoms, such as might be caused by excessive intravascular volume, inappropriate drug "holidays", or worsening of the underlying cardiac disease.

### Role of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibition in patients undergoing carotid revascularization [^117QtsiH]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

This study shows that both discontinuation of RAASIs postoperatively and the lack of RAASI use pre‐ and postoperatively are associated with higher risk of perioperative stroke or death as well as worse stroke‐free survival at 1 year following carotid revascularization. Future clinical trials examining prescribing patterns of RAASIs should aim at clarifying the timing of drug use to maximize the protective effects while minimizing complications of RAASIs in high‐risk vascular patients.

### Should renin-angiotensin system inhibitors be held prior to major surgery? [^111yVFSq]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2024). Medium credibility.

Many patients undergoing surgical procedures have a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, heart failure, or a combination. Often, these conditions involve the chronic use of a renin-angiotensin system inhibitor, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). Observational studies have suggested that continuing ACEIs/ARBs before major noncardiac surgery can increase the risk of intraoperative hypotension, which might drive postoperative complications such as acute kidney injury, myocardial injury, or stroke. Strong recommendations on how to manage ACEIs/ARBs before surgery are, however, lacking owing to insufficient evidence, mostly limited to data from observational studies. Recently, the SPACE trial investigated the impact of preoperative management of ACEIs/ARBs on postoperative myocardial injury. Myocardial injury occurred in 48.3% patients randomised to discontinue and 41.3% patients randomised to continue ACEI/ARB (odds ratio for continuing: 0.77, 95% confidence interval 0.45–1.31). Patients randomised to the 'Stop' group experienced more postoperative hypertension. In a post hoc analysis, patients randomised to the 'Continue' group with low preoperative NT-proBNP concentrations (< 100 pg mL -1) experienced less myocardial injury after surgery than the 'Stop' group, whereas no significant difference was observed in patients with elevated preoperative NT-proBNP concentrations. The SPACE trial provides important and new reassuring data on the safety of continuing ACEIs/ARBs before major surgery, challenging previous beliefs.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Perioperative renin–angiotensin system inhibitors (ACEi/ARB) and outcomes — noncardiac surgery: Data on the potential risk and benefit of ACEi in the perioperative setting are controversial. A large cohort study found that patients who stopped their ACEi or ARB 24 hours before noncardiac surgery were less likely to suffer the primary composite outcome and intraoperative hypotension than those continuing therapy, whereas POISE-3, which randomized 7490 patients, did not find a significant difference between strategies of perioperative discontinuation versus maintenance during the operative and immediate perioperative periods. Omitting RAASi before surgery has been shown to reduce intraoperative hypotension, whereas randomized controlled trials have failed to prove that interruption or implementation improves clinical outcomes.

### Association between peri-operative angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin-2 receptor blockers and acute kidney injury in major elective non-cardiac surgery: a multicentre, prospective cohort study [^1155r3s1]. Anaesthesia (2018). Low credibility.

The peri-operative use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-2 receptor blockers is thought to be associated with an increased risk of postoperative acute kidney injury. To reduce this risk, these agents are commonly withheld during the peri-operative period. This study aimed to investigate if withholding angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-2 receptor blockers peri-operatively reduces the risk of acute kidney injury following major non-cardiac surgery. Patients undergoing elective major surgery on the gastrointestinal tract and/or the liver were eligible for inclusion in this prospective study. The primary outcome was the development of acute kidney injury within seven days of operation. Adjusted multi-level models were used to account for centre-level effects and propensity score matching was used to reduce the effects of selection bias between treatment groups. A total of 949 patients were included from 160 centres across the UK and Republic of Ireland. From this population, 573 (60.4%) patients had their angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-2 receptor blockers withheld during the peri-operative period. One hundred and seventy-five (18.4%) patients developed acute kidney injury; there was no difference in the incidence of acute kidney injury between patients who had their angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-2 receptor blockers continued or withheld (107 (18.7%) vs. 68 (18.1%), respectively; p = 0.914). Following propensity matching, withholding angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-2 receptor blockers did not demonstrate a protective effect against the development of postoperative acute kidney injury (OR (95%CI) 0.89 (0.58–1.34); p = 0.567).

### Preoperative angiotensin-blocking drug therapy is not associated with atrial fibrillation after cardiac surgery [^113Wtsbk]. American Heart Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Preoperative use of angiotensin-blocking drug therapy (ABDT) with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers and its link to occurrence of postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF), a common marker of poor outcomes after cardiac surgery, remain controversial.

Methods

From 1997 to 2003, 10,552 patients underwent coronary artery bypass grafting with or without valve surgery. To adjust for differences of clinical characteristics between patients who received ABDT within 24 hours before surgery compared with those who did not, propensity score analyses were conducted.

Results

Angiotensin-blocking drug therapy was prescribed in 4,795 (45%) before surgery, of which 1,725 (36%) developed POAF before discharge versus 1,908 (33%) of 5,757 patients who did not receive ABDT (unadjusted odds ratio 1.13, 95% CI 1.05–1.25, P < .01). In 6,744 propensity score-matched patients with well-balanced comorbidity profiles, ABDT was not associated with POAF (odds ratio 1.05, CI 0.95–1.16, P = 0.38). Stratified analysis within quintiles of propensity score and propensity-adjusted logistic multivariable regression confirmed these findings.

Conclusions

In this large observational study, we found no evidence of an association between preoperative angiotensin blockade and the occurrence of POAF. Adequately powered randomized studies are needed to clarify the best strategy of perioperative ABDT in patients with and without guideline-based indications.

### Comparison of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blocker management strategies before cardiac surgery: a pilot randomized controlled registry trial [^113bSQTy]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

In this registry‐based RCT of preoperative ACEI or ARB continuation or discontinuation in patients undergoing cardiac surgery, we found that the study protocol was feasible and that medication discontinuation 48 hours before surgery was not associated with a difference in vasoplegic shock or the incidence or duration of postoperative intravenous vasopressors or vasodilators. Similarly, no differences in preoperative acute heart failure, postoperative clinical outcomes, or CSICU LOS were observed between treatment strategies. Although cardiac surgical procedures are performed globally, there is little standardization of preoperative ACEI/ARB management practices despite the potential impact on patient, CSICU, and health system utilization outcomes. In this RCT, which is > 3 times the size of previous trials, no clinically important difference in postoperative outcomes were observed.

Some clinical practice guidelines recommend withholding ACEI or ARB 24 hours before surgery in patients undergoing noncardiac surgery, but this recommendation is based on low‐quality evidence. 28, 29 Three small randomized trials in the noncardiac surgical population reported an increased risk of intraoperative hypotension associated with ACEI or ARB continuation, but they were too small to evaluate postoperative complications. 30, 31, 32 The prospective VISION study cohort reported that ACEI or ARB administration within 24 hours of noncardiac surgery was associated with an increased risk of intraoperative hypotension and the 30‐day composite of mortality, stroke, or myocardial infarction but not postoperative hypotension. 33 The significant baseline differences in the perioperative management of other cardiac and antihypertensive medications in this cohort are an important potential confounder that may limit the applicability of the findings. In the cardiac surgical population, the preoperative administration of an ACEI or ARB has also been associated with intraoperative hypotension, but the postoperative hemodynamic effects are less clear. 10, 11, 34 A single randomized trial of 40 patients reported significantly higher postoperative intravenous vasodilator requirement in the ACEI discontinuation arm. 16 In this analysis, no differences were observed in the incidence or duration of intravenous vasopressor or vasodilator therapy by treatment assignment, although the numerically nonsignificant increase in vasopressor use in the continuation arm and the vasodilator use in the discontinuation arm mirrored the finding in the aforementioned trial of 40 patients. 16 In addition, no differences were observed in a per‐protocol analysis or when ACEI or ARB doses were stratified by drug half‐life. These findings suggest that preoperative ACEI/ARB management strategies are not significantly associated with postoperative hemodynamic changes among patients primarily undergoing isolated CABG.

### Consequences of continuing renin angiotensin aldosterone system antagonists in the preoperative period: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1114QXe7]. BMC Anesthesiology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Patients who use angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs)/angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are prone to developing side effects like hypotension and even refractory hypotension during anesthesia use, and whether ACEIs/ARBs should be continued or discontinued in such patients remains debatable. The present systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to clarify the consequences of continuing or withholding these drugs, especially with regards to the incidence of intraoperative hypotension, in patients who continue to use ACEIs/ARBs on the day of their scheduled surgery.

Methods

Studies with data pertinent to the incidence of intraoperative hypotension during anesthesia use in patients who continued the use of ACEIs/ARBs on the day of their scheduled surgery were considered for inclusion.

Results

Thirteen studies reporting on the incidences of intraoperative hypotension between patients who continued receiving ACEIs/ARBs and those who did not on the day of their surgical procedure were included. The pooled effects showed that hypotension during anesthesia was more likely to develop in patients who continued to take ACEIs/ARBs when compared to those who did not (RR = 1.41, 95% CI: 1.21–1.64). However, there were no significant differences between these groups of patients with regards to postoperative complications including ST-T abnormalities, myocardial injury, myocardial infarction, stroke, major adverse cardiac events, acute kidney injury, or death (RR = 1.25, 95% CI: 0.76–2.04). The differences remained similar in subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses.

Conclusions

No sufficient available evidence to recommend discontinuing ACEIs/ARBs on the day of surgery was found in this literature review and meta-analysis. However, anesthetists should be cautious about the risk for intraoperative hypotension in patients chronically receiving ACEIs/ARBs, and should know how to treat it effectively.

### Comparison of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blocker management strategies before cardiac surgery: a pilot randomized controlled registry trial [^116S4NFp]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Methods

Study Design and Patient Population

This prospective, open‐label, registry‐based RCT was conducted at a single tertiary academic center in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada between May 2014 and June 2017 (NCT02096406). The study was approved by the University of Alberta Health Research Ethics Board (Pro00042749).

Participants were eligible for randomization if they were aged ≥ 18 years and scheduled for elective or urgent CABG (within 14 days of referral) and/or valve surgery and had been treated with an ACEI or ARB for a minimum of 7 days. Exclusion criteria were as follows: emergency surgery, preoperative shock (defined as systolic blood pressure < 90 mm Hg, the need for any vasopressor or inotropic support, or a mechanical cardiac support device), severe uncontrolled preoperative hypertension (defined as blood pressure ≥ 200 mm Hg systolic or ≥ 120 mm Hg diastolic or the preoperative need for intravenous antihypertensive agents), or any mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist therapy.

Study Protocol and Randomization

Eligible patients who provided informed consent were randomized 1:1 using a web‐based randomization sequence, without stratification or blocking, to presurgical preoperative continuation or discontinuation of their ACEI or ARB. Patients randomized to the continuation arm continued their ACEI or ARB up to and including the morning of surgery, with a sip of water. Patients in the discontinuation arm discontinued the medication 2 days before their scheduled surgery; in the event of any surgical postponement, patients were instructed to continue to hold the ACEI or ARB until the time of surgery. In the immediate postoperative period, local CSICU practice sets systolic blood pressure targets of 90 to 110 mm Hg for the first 4 hours and then 90 to 140 mm Hg thereafter. Patients arrive in the CSICU from the operating room sedated with propofol, and sedation is typically discontinued within 2 to 3 hours in stable patients. The CSICU is a closed unit staffed by in‐house board‐certified intensivists who admit and direct the postoperative care of all admitted patients in collaboration with the surgical team. The preoperative management of all other medications and the postoperative reintroduction of an ACEI or ARB were at the discretion of the most responsible physician. During the study period, the hospital performed an average of 1490 open heart surgeries including an average of 533 nonemergent CABGs.

### Association between angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker use prior to major elective surgery and the risk of acute dialysis [^113EWzKo]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Our results are also similar to two small observational studies by Benedetto et al. and Barodka et al. Benedetto et al. studied 536 patients who underwent cardiac surgery and observed a lower risk of AKI with preoperative ACEi use compared to non-use (adjusted OR: 0.48; 95% CI: 0.23 to 0.77). The authors presumed the pathophysiologic benefit of ACEi use stemmed from the preservation of renal blood flow during surgery. Barodka et al. found similar benefits with preoperative ACEi/ARB use compared to non-use in 346 patients who underwent cardiac surgery (adjusted OR: 0.19; 95% CI: 0.04 to 0.84).

Other observational studies by Rady et al. Ouzounian et al. and Yoo et al. studied 11330, 1647, and 472 cardiac surgery patients, respectively, and demonstrated no significant association between preoperative ACEi/ARB use and AKI. However, all three studies observed a non-significant trend towards a benefit with preoperative ACEi/ARB use raising the possibility of insufficient statistical power to detect the association.

Miceli et al. performed a propensity score matched analysis in 9,274 patients who underwent cardiac surgery and noted a 1.36 fold higher risk of AKI (adjusted OR: 1.36; 95% CI: 1.10 to 1.67) with preoperative ACEi/ARB use compared to non-use and a two-fold higher risk of mortality (adjusted OR: 2.00; 95% CI: 1.17 to 3.42). The authors speculated that the AKI occurred as a result of a decrease in renal perfusion, mainly due to reduction in mean arterial pressure along with increased use of vasoconstrictors. Both Cittanova et al. and Arora et al. also observed an increased risk of AKI with preoperative ACEi and ARB use, although the study samples were small (249 aortic surgery patients and 1358 cardiac surgery patients, respectively). Railton et al. studied the outcome of AKI-D and observed a higher incidence of AKI-D with ACEi/ARB use compared to non-use in patients who underwent abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (4.6% vs. 0.8%; P value = 0.01). However, the number of patients (n = 883) and number of events (n = 24) were small.

### Impact of renin-angiotensin system blockers on mortality in veterans undergoing cardiac surgery [^116MU2JC]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Continuation of preoperative RASBs and initiation of RASBs before discharge is associated with decreased 30‐day and 1‐year mortality in veterans undergoing cardiac surgery. Given the findings of our study and prior investigators, continuation of preoperative RASBs or initiation in the early postoperative period should be considered in most patients undergoing cardiac surgery.

### Effect of continuing angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers on the day of surgery on myocardial injury after non-cardiac surgery: a retrospective cohort study [^115QvqfE]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2024). Medium credibility.

Study Objective

To evaluate the effect of continuing of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) prescriptions 24 h before surgery on postoperative myocardial injury and blood pressure in patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery.

Design

A single-center, retrospective study.

Setting

Operating room and perioperative care area.

Patients

42,432 patients who had been taking chronic ACEI/ARB underwent non-cardiac surgery from January 2012 to June 2022.

Interventions

Patients who discontinued ACEI/ARB 24 h before surgery (withheld group, n = 31,055) and those who continued ACEI/ARB 24 h before surgery (continued group, n = 11,377).

Measurements

Primary outcome was myocardial injury after non-cardiac surgery (MINS) within 7 days postoperatively. MINS was defined as an elevated postoperative cardiac troponin measurement above the 99th percentile of the upper reference limit with a rise/fall pattern. Perioperative blood pressure and clinical outcomes were secondary outcomes.

Main Results

Among 42,432 patients, MINS occurred in 2848 patients (6.7%) and was the all-cause of death within 30 days in 122 patients (0.3%). Incidence of MINS was significantly higher in the continued group than the withheld group (847/11,377 [7.4%] vs. 2001/31,055 [6.4%]; OR [95% CI] 1.17 [1.07–1.27]; P < 0.001). After 1:1 propensity score matching, 11,373 patients were included in each group. There was still a significant difference for the occurrence of MINS between two groups in matched cohort (7.4% vs. 6.6%, OR [95% CI] 1.14 [1.03–1.26]; P = 0.015). Time-average weight of mean arterial pressure < 65 mmHg during surgery was significantly higher in the continued group (mean 0.11 vs. 0.09 [95% CI of mean difference] [0.01–0.03]; P < 0.001). However, there was no significant difference in other clinical outcomes and mortality.

Conclusions

Withholding ACEI/ARB before surgery was associated with a reduced risk of intraoperative hypotension and postoperative myocardial injury, but it did not affect overall clinical outcomes in patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery.

### Consequences of continuing renin angiotensin aldosterone system antagonists in the preoperative period: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1138vNT4]. BMC Anesthesiology (2018). Low credibility.

The most concerning factor of hypotension is the occurrence of ischemia-related events, including myocardial injury, myocardial infarction, stroke, and acute kidney injury. However, the results of the present study showed that continuing ACEIs/ARBs on the day of surgery did not increase the incidence of postoperative complications such as myocardial injury, myocardial infarction, stroke, acute kidney injury, or death. In line with the present study, another recent study conducted in eight countries also demonstrated that intraoperative hypotension was not significantly associated with the composite outcome of death, myocardial injury, or stroke within the 30 days after surgery. Furthermore, several myocardial infarctions were reported in patients who discontinued the use of ACEIs/ARBs, though a previous meta-analysis showed that there was no more risk of postoperative myocardial infarction in patients continuing than in those discontinuing ACEIs/ARBs preoperatively. ACEIs/ARBs may protect patients from myocardial infarction, cardiovascular mortality, and morbidity, which might be attributed to the ability of these drugs to prevent ventricular remodeling and improving left ventricular function. A previous study suggested an association between uninterrupted reception of ACEIs/ARBs and a reduction in ischemia-related myocardial cell injury in cardiac surgery. Therefore, some experts recommend that these drugs should not be discontinued before surgery. Furthermore, treatment with ACEIs/ARBs after acute myocardial infarction was associated with improved long-term survival and low rates of adverse renal events.

To date, there has been no large randomized controlled trial (RCT) that explores the long-term effects of discontinuing ACEIs/ARBs. Furthermore, no serious outcomes have occurred, though some intraoperative refractory hypotension cases were reported in patients continuing the use of ACEIs/ARBs on the day of surgery in the current literature. Refractory hypotension could be treated efficiently by a combination of fluid infusion and vasoconstrictors, especially terlipressin. Therefore, in order to avoid a drug holiday and forgetting to restart using the drugs, physicians should be cautious when recommending that these drugs be discontinued.

### Consequences of continuing renin angiotensin aldosterone system antagonists in the preoperative period: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1111BPV1]. BMC Anesthesiology (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

Based on the available data, the present systematic review and meta-analysis of 13 studies demonstrated that patients who continued taking ACEIs/ARBs on the day of their surgery were more likely than those who did not, to develop hypotension during anesthesia. However, receiving ACEIs/ARBs on the day of surgery did not increase the incidences of noted postoperative complications, including myocardial infarction, stroke, acute kidney injury, and death. The subgroup and sensitivity analyses showed that the association is similar only when comparing the patients who ceased taking ACEIs/ARBs prior to surgery with those who continued taking the drugs.

RAAS antagonists or ACEIs/ARBs, are the first-line drugs for the treatment of hypertension and chronic heart failure. Because intraoperative hemodynamic instability, especially refractory hypotension, has been observed in patients who have been treated chronically with ACEIs/ARBs, some researchers have suggested discontinuing these drugs on the day of surgery. RAAS antagonists play a major role in regulating and maintaining normal blood pressure, especially during general anesthesia use. Additionally, some researchers have suggested that ACEIs/ARBs reduce the adrenergic vasoconstrictive response. This might partly explain why ACEI/ARB-associated hypotension was refractory and resistant to phenylephrine, ephedrine, and norepinephrine. However, severe or refractory hypotension during anesthesia administration in patients chronically receiving ACEIs/ARBs has only been reported in several cases. In most cases, hypotension was sensitive to intravenous fluid infusion and vasoconstrictors, and continuing ACEIs/ARBs on the day of surgery did not increase the incidence of severe or refractory hypotension. Terlipressin is known to be effective in rapidly correcting refractory hypotension, even after the failure of ephedrine in patients chronically treated with ACEIs/ARBs, without impairing left ventricular function.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Perioperative blood pressure thresholds, risk stratification, and beta-blocker initiation/withdrawal: There is conflicting evidence for patients with diastolic BP (DBP) > 110 mm Hg regarding recommending delay of surgery, and in a systematic review and meta-analysis, preoperative hypertension was associated with a 35% increase in cardiovascular complications; an increase in cardiovascular and cerebrovascular complications and renal failure has been reported in patients with DBP > 110 mm Hg immediately before surgery, whereas patients with DBP < 110 mm Hg do not appear to be at significantly increased risk. During induction of anesthesia, a sympathetic reaction can result in a 20 to 30 mm Hg increase in BP, and an elevated BP on the day of surgery may represent "white-coat hypertension"; therefore referring to patients' baseline ambulatory BP is recommended to guide BP management. Without evidence for increased risk for perioperative complications in patients whose preoperative systolic/diastolic BP is < 180/110 mm Hg, there is little evidence to defer surgery and BP can be controlled postoperatively or after discharge. Although few studies describe risks of withdrawing BB in the perioperative period, longstanding evidence suggests that abrupt withdrawal of long-term BB is harmful and should be avoided; there are fewer data to describe whether short-term (1 to 2 days) perioperative use of BB followed by rapid discontinuation is harmful, and abrupt discontinuation of clonidine can result in rebound hypertension associated with norepinephrine surge. This guideline recommends against starting a BB on the day of surgery in BB-naïve patients, particularly at high initial doses, in long-acting form, and if there are no plans for dose titration or monitoring for adverse events.

### Comparison of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blocker management strategies before cardiac surgery: a pilot randomized controlled registry trial [^111LzGUP]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

The continuation of ACEI or ARB dosing is known to increase the risk of postinduction and intraoperative hypotension, but the association between ACEI or ARB preoperative management and postoperative clinical outcomes has remained less clear. 33, 37 In this pilot study, clinical event rates were low (likely reflecting enrollment of patients undergoing isolated CABG with preserved left ventricular function and kidney function), and no differences in clinical or health resource utilization outcomes were observed between treatment arms. Although underpowered to detect major differences in clinical events and physiological end points, the present data are the first from a controlled clinical trial. The inconsistent associations between ACEI or ARB continuation and clinical events (eg, an increased risk of AKI and mortality and a lower risk of myocardial infarction) in observational studies may, in part, reflect differences in the surgical risk between study populations and the lack of clarity around the exact timing of perioperative ACEI or ARB dosing in some of these studies. 6, 8, 9, 11, 13, 15 A meta‐analysis of nonrandomized studies by Bandeali et al reported that a preoperative ACEI administered up to the morning of cardiac surgery was associated with a higher risk of AKI and atrial fibrillation. 7 The present findings are insufficient to change clinical practice; a larger clinical trial, adequately powered for major clinical events such as AKI, stroke, or cardiovascular mortality, is required to rigorously evaluate the efficacy and safety of preoperative ACEI/ARB management strategies. Our results can serve to inform future study design insofar as the inclusion of patients across a wider spectrum of surgical risk for postoperative AKI and mortality will be required to achieve a sufficient number of clinical end points.

Box 3 Prevention of PO-AKI: preoperative strategies

Consensus Statement 3a

We recommend that when considering use of medications or interventions that are associated with an increased risk of acute kidney injury (AKI), the relative benefits and/or necessity of the medications or interventions should be balanced with the risk of postoperative AKI (PO-AKI). This recommendation applies to outpatient medications, new medications and exposures including contrast media (grade C evidence; strong recommendation).

Consensus Statement 3b

We recommend discontinuing angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) for a minimum of 24 h before surgery, dependent on the specific medication, to minimize the risks of perioperative hypotension and/or PO-AKI (grade D evidence, weak recommendation).

Consensus Statement 3c

We recommend assessing the relative risks and benefits of use of NSAIDs (including COX2 inhibitors) in individual patients. In general, in patients at a high risk of PO-AKI, the risk of AKI associated with use of NSAIDs might outweigh the benefits with regard to opioid minimization, whereas in low-risk patients, the benefits of use of NSAIDs might outweigh the risks. The risk–benefit profile in patients at a moderate risk of AKI is particularly uncertain (grade D evidence; strong recommendation).

### Consequences of continuing renin angiotensin aldosterone system antagonists in the preoperative period: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115WMEuP]. BMC Anesthesiology (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, the data available at the time this study was conducted did not provide sufficient evidence to support that continuing ACEIs/ARBs on the day of surgery in patients who chronically received these drugs is associated with obvious disadvantages. No significant incidences of severe or refractory hypotension or postoperative ischemia-related complications were observed between those patients continuing ACEIs/ARBs and those who either discontinued these drugs or continued using other antihypertensive drugs. Therefore, evidence supporting the discontinuation of ACEIs/ARBs on the day of surgery is lacking. However, anesthetists should be cautious about the possibility of hypotension in patients chronically receiving ACEIs/ARBs, and should know how to treat it effectively. To explore the long-term effects of continuing or discontinuing ACEIs/ARBs in patients, RCTs involving a large number of patients are required.

Perioperative medical therapy — data gaps include limited high-quality data regarding dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) management after elective noncardiac surgery following balloon angioplasty alone without stent placement, after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), or after transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (TEER), and uncertainty about the efficacy and safety of shorter DAPT durations after percutaneous coronary intervention in patients undergoing noncardiac surgery. Large randomized controlled trials are needed to clarify the role of perioperative statin initiation, and no data currently exist regarding the perioperative role of sacubitril/valsartan; trials are also needed to determine preoperative management of renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system inhibitors for patients planned for noncardiac surgery. Evidence is needed on omission, continuation, or initiation of calcium channel blockers; perioperative continuation of chronic alpha-2 receptor agonist therapy has not been addressed in trials; and there are no established data for glycoprotein IIB/IIIA inhibitors as a bridging strategy. The optimal approach to beta-blocker initiation remains unknown. For diabetes care, challenges include selecting markers of glucose control that predict outcomes, methods to control perioperative glucose, managing older and newer agents, and determining optimal glucose levels and timing of reinstitution of sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors after surgery. Further research is needed, but advisories suggest GLP-1 agonists should be held for 1 dose before elective noncardiac surgery to reduce the risk of pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents at the time of surgery.

### Predictors of hypotension during anesthesia induction in patients with hypertension on medication: a retrospective observational study [^114TBAKs]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We found that regular use of ARBs/ACE-Is with a long half-life, regular use of beta blockers, low pre-induction MAP, and female sex are risk factors and regular use of CCBs is a suppressive factor for hypotension during anesthesia induction in patients with hypertension on medication.

Considering our finding that regular use of ARBs/ACE-Is with a long half-life increases the risk of hypotension during anesthesia induction in patients with hypertension on medication, it is necessary to consider the pros and cons of preoperative ARBs/ACE-Is withdrawal and the half-lives of ARBs/ACE-Is. First, although it has been reported that withdrawal of ARBs/ACE-Is for 24 h before surgery is effective for avoiding intraoperative hypotension, it has further been reported that ARBs/ACE-Is withdrawal is not necessary, and no consensus has yet been reached. In a recent report that preoperative withdrawal of ARBs/ACE-Is is not required to avoid intraoperative hypotension, it was suggested that individual perioperative risk factors should be carefully considered when deciding whether to continue or withhold ARBs/ACE-Is before surgery. In this study, we included a 24-h washout period before general anesthesia for patients who regularly used ARBs/ACE-Is. Second, although the half-life of ARBs/ACE-Is varies from 2 to 44 h as shown in Table 1, previous reports have used a uniform washout period. We previously reported a case wherein the regular use of ARBs with a long half-life might have caused refractory hypotension during anesthesia induction, even when ARBs were withheld for 24 h prior to general anesthesia induction. Telmisartan has the longest half-life among all the currently used ARBs, and it accumulates in the plasma with regular use, which prolongs its half-life. Therefore, with a half-life of 24 h set as a cutoff value, we divided the regular use of ARBs/ACE-Is into long half-life and short-to-middle half-life. We found that patients receiving ARBs/ACE-Is with a long half-life had greater odds (aOR, 3.17) of experiencing hypotension during anesthesia induction than those receiving ARBs/ACE-Is with a short-to-middle half-life. Therefore, the washout period of ARBs/ACE-Is, especially those with a long half-life of 24 h or more, should be carefully adjusted by the attending physician to avoid hypotension during anesthesia induction.

Neurohormonal blockade and hypertension management post–mechanical circulatory support (LVAD) implant should be started following vasopressor wean during the postoperative period, with blood pressure management to maintain a mean arterial pressure 75 to 90 mm Hg for patients on continuous flow LVAD support; angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) are recommended in LVAD patients, with observational data supporting a role in reducing gastrointestinal bleeding and one study showing marked reductions when started within the first 30 postoperative days; if ACE inhibitor/ARB use is limited or contraindicated, hydralazine and nitrates can be introduced, but nitrates should not be given with a phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor; angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitors lack large LVAD-specific studies but may be considered in carefully selected patients, and side-effects should be monitored; beta-blockers and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists should be started during the postoperative period, with beta-blockers initiated once patients are stable off inotropes, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists started once renal function has stabilized postoperatively, while use in advanced CKD and/or hyperkalemia is not recommended.

### Association between angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker use prior to major elective surgery and the risk of acute dialysis [^112Swezr]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Some studies but not others suggest angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) use prior to major surgery associates with a higher risk of postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI) and death.

Methods

We conducted a large population-based retrospective cohort study of patients aged 66 years or older who received major elective surgery in 118 hospitals in Ontario, Canada from 1995 to 2010 (n = 237,208). We grouped the cohort into ACEi/ARB users (n = 101,494) and non-users (n = 135,714) according to whether the patient filled at least one prescription for an ACEi or ARB (or not) in the 120 days prior to surgery. Our study outcomes were acute kidney injury treated with dialysis (AKI-D) within 14 days of surgery and all-cause mortality within 90 days of surgery.

Results

After adjusting for potential confounders, preoperative ACEi/ARB use versus non-use was associated with 17% lower risk of post-operative AKI-D (adjusted relative risk (RR): 0.83; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.71 to 0.98) and 9% lower risk of all-cause mortality (adjusted RR: 0.91; 95% CI: 0.87 to 0.95). Propensity score matched analyses provided similar results. The association between ACEi/ARB and AKI-D was significantly modified by the presence of preoperative chronic kidney disease (CKD) (P value for interaction < 0.001) with the observed association evident only in patients with CKD (CKD - adjusted RR: 0.62; 95% CI: 0.50 to 0.78 versus No CKD: adjusted RR: 1.00; 95% CI: 0.81 to 1.24).

Conclusions

In this cohort study, preoperative ACEi/ARB use versus non-use was associated with a lower risk of AKI-D, and the association was primarily evident in patients with CKD. Large, multi-centre randomized trials are needed to inform optimal ACEi/ARB use in the peri-operative setting.

### Perioperative use of angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists [^116nxjQ8]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2017). Low credibility.

Study Objective

Clinical repercussions of perioperative treatment with ACEIs/ARBs.

Design

Systematic review according to PRISMA statement.

Setting

Perioperative period.

Patients

29 studies 11 cases/cases series, 12 observational studies and 6 randomized studies.

Measurements

Arterial blood pressure differences, refractory hypotension, other comorbidities.

Main Results

The studies show different results regarding the topics measured. They are divided in the results regarding blood pressure, long term morbidities and effects in neuraxial anesthesia.

Conclusions

Withholding AECI/ARBs on the morning prior to surgery could be recommended as a potentially effective measure, with a low level of evidence, in order to reduce the appearance of hypotension in the perioperative period of non-cardiac surgery.

### Continuation vs discontinuation of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors before major noncardiac surgery: the… [^117BXqGU]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions and Relevance Among patients who underwent major noncardiac surgery, a continuation strategy of RASIs before surgery was not associated with a higher rate of postoperative complications than a discontinuation strategy. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials. gov Identifier: NCT03374449. The 2014 guidelines from the European Society of Cardiology and the European Society of Anesthesiology4 stated that withholding RASI therapy preoperatively should be considered in patients with hypertension. During the same year, the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association5 issued guidelines that stated the perioperative continuation of RASIs is reasonable. The strategy of RASI management before major surgery has long been a matter of debate, and the lack of large, randomized clinical trials has prevented the establishment of recommendations with high-quality evidence.

Patients randomized to the preoperative RASI continuation strategy had a similar rate of all-cause mortality and major postoperative complications compared with patients randomized to the RASI discontinuation strategy. Patients randomized to the preoperative RASI continuation strategy had more episodes of intraoperative hypotension and these episodes lasted for a longer duration. One of the main reasons for withholding RASIs before surgery is the possible increased risk of intraoperative hypotension, which has previously been associated with postoperative complications. 12 Patients randomized to the RASI continuation strategy in the current study had a higher rate of hypotension. A systematic review1 of 5 randomized clinical trials and 4 cohort studies found that withholding RASIs before surgery was associated with fewer cases of intraoperative hypotension.

In a prospective observational cohort, 2 withholding RASIs 24 hours before surgery was associated with a lower risk of intraoperative hypotension and fewer complications, but the association might have been affected by unmeasured confounders. Furthermore, adherence to strategy instructions was suboptimal in the POISE-3 trial21.

Background

The effect on cardiovascular outcomes of withholding angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers in chronic users before noncardiac surgery is unknown.

Methods

In this international prospective cohort study, the authors analyzed data from 14,687 patients (including 4,802 angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin II receptor blocker users) at least 45 yr old who had in-patient noncardiac surgery from 2007 to 2011. Using multivariable regression models, the authors studied the relationship between withholding angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers and a primary composite outcome of all-cause death, stroke, or myocardial injury after noncardiac surgery at 30 days, with intraoperative and postoperative clinically important hypotension as secondary outcomes.

Results

Compared to patients who continued their angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers, the 1,245 (26%) angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin II receptor blocker users who withheld their angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers in the 24h before surgery were less likely to suffer the primary composite outcome of all-cause death, stroke, or myocardial injury (150/1,245 [12.0%] vs. 459/3,557 [12.9%]; adjusted relative risk, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.70 to 0.96; P = 0.01) and intraoperative hypotension (adjusted relative risk, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.72 to 0.93; P < 0.001). The risk of postoperative hypotension was similar between the two groups (adjusted relative risk, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.77 to 1.10; P = 0.36). Results were consistent across the range of preoperative blood pressures. The practice of withholding angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers was only modestly correlated with patient characteristics and the type and timing of surgery.

Conclusions

Withholding angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers before major noncardiac surgery was associated with a lower risk of death and postoperative vascular events. A large randomized trial is needed to confirm this finding. In the interim, clinicians should consider recommending that patients withhold angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers 24h before surgery.

Perioperative and 1‐Year Outcomes

On univariable analysis, patients with preoperative and no RAASIs intake had higher risk of perioperative stroke (6.4% versus 3.7% versus 3.1%, P < 0.001), death (3.2% versus 1.1% versus 0.5%, P < 0.001), and stroke or death (8.5% versus 4.5% versus 3.6%, P < 0.001), respectively, compared with patients with continuous intake (Table 2). After adjusting for potential confounders, preoperative and no RAASIs intake were associated with higher odds of postoperative stroke (OR, 1.7 [95% CI, 1.5–1.9]; P < 0.001; OR, 1.1 [95% CI, 1.03–1.2]; P = 0.010), death (OR, 4.8 [95% CI, 3.8–6.1]; P < 0.001; OR, 1.9 [95% CI, 1.6–2.2]; P < 0.001), and stroke/death (OR, 2.05 [95% CI, 1.8–2.3]; P < 0.001; OR, 1.2 [95% CI, 1.1–1.3]; P < 0.001), respectively. At 1 year, preoperative and no RAASIs intake were associated with higher odds of stroke, death, and stroke/death (Table 3). Upon dividing 1‐year mortality into shorter time intervals, preoperative and no intake were associated with significantly higher rates of mortality from 0 to 40 days. From 40 to 365 days, preoperative and no intake were associated with a small, but statistically significant, increase in mortality (Table S2, Figures S1 and S2).

### A systematic review of outcomes associated with withholding or continuing angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers before noncardiac surgery [^115bVAQT]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The global rate of major noncardiac surgical procedures is increasing annually, and of those patients presenting for surgery, increasing numbers are taking either an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) or an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB). The current recommendations of whether to continue or withhold ACE-I and ARB in the perioperative period are conflicting. Previous meta-analyses have linked preoperative ACE-I/ARB therapy to the increased incidence of postinduction hypotension; however, they have failed to correlate this with adverse patient outcomes. The aim of this meta-analysis was to determine whether continuation or withholding ACE-I or ARB therapy in the perioperative period is associated with mortality and major morbidity.

Methods

This meta-analysis was prospectively registered on PROSPERO (CRD42017055291). A comprehensive search of MEDLINE (PubMed), CINAHL (EBSCO host), ProQuest, Cochrane database, Scopus, and Web of Science was conducted on December 6, 2016. We included adult patients > 18 years of age on chronic ACE-I or ARB therapy who underwent noncardiac surgery in which ACE-I or ARB was either withheld or continued on the morning of surgery. Primary outcomes included all-cause mortality and major cardiac events (MACE). Secondary outcomes included the risk of congestive heart failure, acute kidney injury, stroke, intraoperative/postoperative hypotension, and the length of hospital stay.

Results

After abstract review, the full text of 25 studies was retrieved, of which 9 fulfilled the inclusion criteria: 5 were randomized control trials, and 4 were cohort studies. These studies included a total of 6022 patients on chronic ACE-I/ARB therapy before noncardiac surgery. A total of 1816 patients withheld treatment the morning of surgery and 4206 continued their ACE-I/ARB. Preoperative demographics were similar between the 2 groups. Withholding ACE-I/ARB therapy was not associated with a difference in mortality (odds ratio [OR], 0.97; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.62–1.52; I = 0%) or MACE (OR, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.82–1.52; I = 0%). However, withholding therapy was associated with significantly less intraoperative hypotension (OR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.47–0.85; I = 71%). No effect estimate could be pooled concerning length of hospital stay and congestive heart failure.

Conclusions

This meta-analysis did not demonstrate an association between perioperative administration of ACE-I/ARB and mortality or MACE. It did, however, confirm the current observation that perioperative continuation of ACE-I/ARBs is associated with an increased incidence of intraoperative hypotension. A large randomized control trial is necessary to determine the appropriate perioperative management of ACE-I and ARBs.

### 2009 ACCF / AHA focused update on perioperative beta blockade [^115hsB3b]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2009). Medium credibility.

Perioperative beta-blocker therapy — recommendations and risk factors: Preoperative beta-blocker therapy should be considered in the context of a full evaluation of each patient's clinical and surgical risk, including identification of active cardiac conditions that require intensive management and may result in delay or cancellation of surgery unless the surgery is emergent. Clinical risk factors used in current recommendations are unchanged from the prior document and include history of ischemic heart disease, history of compensated or prior heart failure, history of cerebrovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, and renal insufficiency defined as a preoperative serum creatinine of more than 2 mg/dL. The surgery-specific cardiac risk of noncardiac surgery remains relevant, but limited data are available to guide beta-blocker use with newer techniques (e.g., percutaneous or endovascular vascular procedures) that may be associated with lower short-term risk. The prior document outlined conflicting evidence regarding the efficacy of beta blockers in reducing perioperative cardiac events, and the best approach to medically reduce cardiovascular complications during noncardiac surgery was still unknown. The authors advocated for randomized controlled trials because there may be some harm associated with beta-blocker therapy in low-risk patients, and they noted key literature gaps: most trials were inadequately powered; few randomized trials of medical therapy to prevent perioperative major adverse cardiac events had been performed; few trials examined perioperative beta-blocker therapy, particularly in high-risk patients; studies to determine the role of beta blockers in intermediate- and low-risk populations and the optimal type, dose, timing, duration, and titration were lacking; and no studies addressed care-delivery mechanisms for how, when, and by whom therapy should be prescribed and monitored.

### Preoperative use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors / angiotensin receptor blockers is associated with increased risk for acute kidney injury after cardiovascular surgery [^113Yhbw8]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Acute kidney injury (AKI) occurs commonly after cardiac surgery. Most patients who undergo cardiac surgery receive long-term treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB). The aim of this study was to determine whether long-term use of ACEI/ARB is associated with an increased incidence of AKI after cardiac surgery.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

This was a retrospective cohort study of 1358 adult patients who underwent cardiac surgery between January 1, 2001, and December 31, 2005, in two tertiary care hospitals in Buffalo, NY. The incidence of AKI was determined after cardiac surgery. Clinical data were collected using a standardized form that included comorbid condition, use of ACEI/ARB, and intraoperative and postoperative complications.

Results

Overall, 40.2% of patients developed AKI. Preoperative variables that were significantly associated with development of AKI included increasing age; nonwhite race; combined valve surgery and coronary artery bypass grafting compared with coronary artery bypass grafting alone; American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Risk Score category 4/5 compared with 2 to 3; presence of diabetes, congestive heart failure, or neurologic disease at baseline; use of ACEI/ARB; and emergency surgery. Intra- and postoperative factors that were associated with postoperative AKI were hypotension during surgery, use of vasopressors, and postoperative hypotension. Multiple regression logistic model confirmed an independent and significant association of AKI and preoperative use of ACEI/ARB. This was confirmed using a bivariate-probit and propensity score model that adjusts for confounding by indication of use and selection bias.

Conclusions

Preoperative use of ACEI/ARB is associated with a 27.6% higher risk for AKI postoperatively. Stopping ACEI or ARB before cardiac surgery may reduce the incidence of AKI.

### Preoperative angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blocker use and acute kidney injury in patients undergoing cardiac surgery [^111Wo5GD]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Using either an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) the morning of surgery may lead to 'functional' postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI), measured by an abrupt increase in serum creatinine. Whether the same is true for 'structural' AKI, measured with new urinary biomarkers, is unknown.

Methods

The TRIBE-AKI study was a prospective cohort study of 1594 adults undergoing cardiac surgery at six hospitals between July 2007 and December 2010. We classified the degree of exposure to ACEi/ARB into three categories: 'none' (no exposure prior to surgery), 'held' (on chronic ACEi/ARB but held on the morning of surgery) or 'continued' (on chronic ACEi/ARB and taken the morning of surgery). The co-primary outcomes were 'functional' AKI based upon changes in pre- to postoperative serum creatinine, and 'structural AKI', based upon peak postoperative levels of four urinary biomarkers of kidney injury.

Results

Across the three levels (none, held and continued) of ACEi/ARB exposure there was a graded increase in functional AKI, as defined by AKI stage 1 or worse; (31, 34 and 42%, P for trend 0.03) and by percentage change in serum creatinine from pre- to postoperative (25, 26 and 30%, P for trend 0.03). In contrast, there were no differences in structural AKI across the strata of ACEi/ARB exposure, as assessed by four structural AKI biomarkers (neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, kidney injury molecule-1, interleukin-18 or liver-fatty acid-binding protein).

Conclusions

Preoperative ACEi/ARB usage was associated with functional but not structural acute kidney injury. As AKI from ACEi/ARB in this setting is unclear, interventional studies testing different strategies of perioperative ACEi/ARB use are warranted.

Perioperative RAASi continuation versus omission — trial evidence and scope: randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing omission to continuation enrolled low- to intermediate-risk patients undergoing major noncardiac surgery (NCS), and intraoperative hypotension (MAP < 60 mm Hg) occurred commonly when these agents were continued, yet continuation compared with omission did not result in worse clinical outcomes; patients with high (SBP > 160 mm Hg) and low (SBP < 105 mm Hg) blood pressure are often excluded from RCTs, and no data currently exist regarding sacubitril/valsartan; intraoperative hypotension may increase postoperative myocardial injury and mortality; in PREOP-ACEI, among patients stable on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) for at least 6 weeks before planned major noncardiac nonvascular surgery, fewer episodes of intraoperative hypotension (SBP < 80 mm Hg) occurred when the final preoperative ACEI dose was omitted, with no differences in major adverse cardiovascular endpoints, postanesthesia unit recovery time, or length of stay; a meta-analysis that included data from 6022 patients found intraoperative hypotension more common with continued ACEI/ARB but no difference in MACE; recently, POISE-3 showed no difference in major vascular events at 30 days in nearly 7500 patients; given uncertainties, an individualized approach to perioperative management of ACEI or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) is warranted.

### Comparison of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blocker management strategies before cardiac surgery: a pilot randomized controlled registry trial [^115NMEks]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Background Postoperative clinical outcomes associated with the preoperative continuation or discontinuation of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) before cardiac surgery remain unclear. Methods and Results In a single-center, open-label, randomized, registry-based clinical trial, patients undergoing nonemergent cardiac surgery were assigned to ACEI / ARB continuation or discontinuation 2 days before surgery. Among the 584 patients screened, 261 met study criteria and 126 (48.3%) patients were enrolled. In total,121 patients (96% adherence; 60 to continuation and 61 to ACEI / ARB discontinuation) underwent surgery and completed the study protocol, and follow-up was 100% complete. Postoperative intravenous vasopressor use (78.3% versus 75.4%, P = 0.703), vasodilator use (71.7% versus 80.3%, P = 0.265), vasoplegic shock (31.7% versus 27.9%, P = 0.648), median duration of vasopressor (10 versus 5 hours, P = 0.494), and vasodilator requirements (10 versus 9 hours, P = 0.469) were not significantly different between the continuation and discontinuation arms. No differences were observed in the incidence of acute kidney injury (1.7% versus 1.6%, P = 0.991), stroke (no events, mortality (1.7% versus 1.6%, P = 0.991), median duration of mechanical ventilation (6 versus 6 hours, P = 0.680), and median intensive care unit length of stay (43 versus 27 hours, P = 0.420) between the treatment arms. Conclusions A randomized study evaluating the routine continuation or discontinuation of ACEIs or ARB s before cardiac surgery was feasible, and treatment assignment was not associated with differences in postoperative physiological or clinical outcomes. These preliminary findings suggest that preoperative ACEI / ARB management strategies did not affect the postoperative course of patients undergoing cardiac surgery.

### Management of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors prior to major surgery: insights from the STOP-or-NOT trial [^116TPXAU]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Strong recommendations on how to manage renin-angiotensin system inhibitors, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers, before surgery are lacking because of a lack of evidence, which is mostly limited to data from observational studies. The STOP-or-NOT trial was a large multicentre randomised trial designed to determine whether chronic renin-angiotensin system inhibitors should be continued or discontinued before major noncardiac surgery. As principal investigators of the STOP-or-NOT trial, we discuss the trial's results and how they contribute to the existing literature on management of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors before surgery.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Patients scheduled for surgical procedures — For patients with hypertension scheduled for major surgery who have been on beta blockers (BBs) chronically, BBs should be continued throughout the preoperative period to assist with blood pressure (BP) control (Class 1, Level B-NR). For elective major surgery, it is reasonable to continue most medications for hypertension throughout the preoperative period (Class 2a, Level C-EO). In major surgery, discontinuation of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) preoperatively may be considered to prevent hypotension during surgery (Class 2b, Level B-R). In elective major surgery with systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥ 180 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ≥ 110 mm Hg, deferring surgery may be considered especially in high-risk patients to minimize perioperative complications (Class 2b, Level C-LD). In patients with hypertension scheduled for surgery, abrupt preoperative discontinuation of BB or clonidine may result in rebound hypertension and is potentially harmful (Class 3: Harm, Level B-NR). For patients with hypertension scheduled for surgery, BB should not be started on the day of surgery in BB-naive patients because of increased risk of postoperative mortality (Class 3: Harm, Level B-R).

### Discontinuation vs. continuation of renin-angiotensin system inhibition before non-cardiac surgery: the SPACE trial [^1142ZU9K]. European Heart Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Treatment

For patients randomized to discontinue RAS inhibitors, the duration of cessation before surgery was defined by the pharmacokinetics of each drug (see Supplementary data online, Appendix for full protocol). For RAS inhibitors with a duration of action ≥ 24 h, the drug was discontinued 48 h prior to surgery. All other ACE-I and/or ARB were stopped on the morning of the day (i.e. 24–32 h) before surgery.

After randomization, participants received confirmation of which treatment group they have been allocated to and reminded of their randomized allocation by daily telephone call and/or text message, or in person if they were in hospital. Renin–angiotensin system inhibitors were restarted after surgery on the morning of post-operative day 2, in accord with recommendations by the ESC guidelines. Resumption or continuation of ACE-I and/or ARB did not involve dose modifications. Recommencing RAS inhibitors was delayed on post-operative day 2 if systolic blood pressure was < 90 mmHg in the preceding 12 h, vasoactive therapy was required to maintain blood pressure and/or if acute kidney injury [as defined by Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria] had been sustained. The decision to restart ACE-I and/or ARB was confirmed by the principal investigator at each site. All other treatments (concomitant care) were administered according to usual peri-operative practice and were not influenced by trial-group allocation, in accord with recent ESC peri-operative guidelines.

Follow-up

Blood samples were collected before induction of anaesthesia and on the morning 24 and 48 h after surgery. Investigators reviewed the medical record of participants (paper or electronic) at 24, 48, and 72 h after surgery. To minimise bias, follow-up data were collected by a study team member who was masked to the treatment group allocation. The schedule of assessments is detailed in the protocol.

P145 Should preoperative antihypertensive agents be hold in high risk hypertensive patients undergoing major noncardiac surgery with neuraxial block?

S Kongsayreepong 1, W Chaisi 2

1 Siriraj Hospital, Anesthesiology & Critical Care, Bangkok, Thailand; 2 Siriraj Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand

Introduction:

With the benefit of neuraxial block in major noncardiac surgery, but serious cardiac events're reported in high risk pts receiving preop beta-adrenergic blocking agent. The aim of this study was to study predictors of intraoperative cardiac complications in pts underwent major noncardiac surgery with neuraxial block.

Methods:

This prospective observational study was done in 360 high risk for cardiac complication pts, underwent elective major noncardiac surgery with neuraxial block [spinal, thoracic (TE) or lumbar epidural (LE) anesthesia] alone or combined with GA & admitted to the SICU during Jan 2017-Sep 2019. Pts with ESRD or underwent arterial vas surgery were excluded. Study data included: pts demographic, comorbidities, ASA class, preop hypertensive med (beta adrenergic blocking agent, ACEI/ARB, vasodilator), intraoperative cardiac complications [significant hypotension (SBP < 90 mmHg or MAP < 65 mmHg > 10 mins) requiring fluid resuscitation or inotropic agent, serious cardiac arrhythmias needed medication or intervention, PMI, cardiac failure, cardiac arrest, cardiac death), within 72 hours postoperative organ dysfunction (AKI, stroke) & 30days mortality.

Results:

Among the studied pts (age 65 + 16yrs), 72% was ASA III, 54% had hx of HTN. 64% underwent major abdominal surgery, 21%, 8% & 72% received spinal, spinal plus GA and TE or LE plus GA subsequently. 79% had serious intraop cardiac complications (80%, 15% & 4% had significant hypotension, PMI & cardiac arrest subsequently), 39%, 3% & 11% had AKI, ischemia stroke&delirium subsequently. 30 days mortality was 13%. From multivariate variate analysis showed age > 75 yrs, hx of HTN, preop beta-adrenergic blocking agent, vasodilator, combined beta-adrenergic blocking agent & vasodilator or ACEI/ARB, high dose local anesthetic agent were significant predictors of intraop serious cardiac complications.

Conclusions:

Further study about decrease or withhold preop antihypertensive med in high risk patient undergoing major noncardiac surgery with central neuraxial block is warranted.

British Journal of Anaesthesia (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design

This study was a preplanned analysis of the Stopping Perioperative ACE-inhibitors/ARBs (SPACE) phase 2a Clinical Trial of an Investigational Medicinal Product (ISRCTN17251494), regulated by the Health Research Authority (UK) and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency UK (Eudract: 2016–004141–90). Six UK centres recruited patients who provided written informed consent, in accord with the London (City and East) research ethics committee (16/LO/1495). An independent steering committee and data monitoring and ethics committee (DMEC) oversaw the trial (Supplementary data).

Inclusion criteria

- Adults prescribed RAS inhibitors aged ≥ 60 yr
- American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status ≥ 3
- Elective major surgery requiring general anaesthesia for procedures lasting ≥ 120 min

Exclusion criteria

- Current participation in any other interventional clinical trial
- Myocardial infarction within the 3 months preceding surgery

Randomisation

Patients were assigned randomly in a 1:1 ratio to either continue or discontinue RAS inhibitors according to the individual pharmacokinetics of each drug. Randomisation was performed centrally, with minimisation by centre, planned surgical procedure category, and RAS inhibitor type.

Post-randomisation management of renin–angiotensin system inhibitors

RAS inhibitors were restarted after surgery on the morning of postoperative day 2 in accord with recommendations by European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelinesat the usual dose. Restarting RAS inhibitors did not occur on postoperative day 2 if systolic arterial pressure was < 90 mm Hg in the preceding 12 h or vasoactive therapy was used or if acute kidney injury occurred (KDIGO criteria). All other treatments were managed by the local clinical teams.

Data collection

Blood samples were collected before induction of anaesthesia, 24 h, and 48 h after surgery (see Supplementary data for schedule of visits), from which serum and plasma was prepared. Plasma troponin samples were batch-analysed at the same laboratory (The Doctor's Laboratory, London, UK) by personnel masked to all study details. To minimise bias, follow-up data were collected by a study team member who was masked to the treatment group allocation.

### Consequences of continuing renin angiotensin aldosterone system antagonists in the preoperative period: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113uKmyZ]. BMC Anesthesiology (2018). Low credibility.

Methods

Search strategy

The following electronic databases were searched: the Cochrane Library, PubMed, the Web of Knowledge, and Elsevier (ScienceDirect OnLine, SDOL) to retrieve studies investigating the incidence of hypotension in those patients continuously receiving ACEIs/ARBs, especially in patients continuing their use of ACEIs/ARBs on the day of their surgery.

Text headings and medical subject heading (MeSH) terms for the search included "angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/ACEIs", "angiotensin II receptor blockers/ARBs", "angiotensin receptor antagonist", "renin-angiotensin system (RAS)/RAS inhibitor", "renin-angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS)/RAAS inhibitor", "hypotension", and "low blood pressure".

The search strategy included considering any terms pertinent to renin-angiotensin system/RAS inhibitors and any terms related to hypotension. Eligible trials were identified via electronic searches from 1981, when captopril, the first ACEI, was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration, up to July 1, 2017. A hand-search method was used to examine the reference lists of some of the identified trials. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were used to guide the meta-analysis.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

Case-control studies, cohort studies, and/or randomized controlled trials were considered for inclusion if they met the following criteria: (i) written in the English language; (ii) enrolled adults scheduled for elective or emergency surgery who were chronically using ACEIs/ARBs; and (iii) compared the incidence of hypotension during anesthesia in patients continuing to receive ACEIs/ARBs with those who did not receive these drugs on the day of surgery. The exclusion criteria were: (i) formatted as a letter, review or meeting abstract; (ii) containing a lack of hypotension data as incidences or numbers; and (iii) containing no delineation between patients continuing to receive ACEIs/ARBs and those who were not, or those who were using other drugs or who had never used antihypertensive drugs. Only published data were included in the present study.

Data extraction

The data were extracted independently by three reviewers (Qiong Ling, Yu Gu and Jiaxin Chen) and validated by a fourth one (Qianqian Zhu). The following information was extracted from each included study: the name of the primary author, year of publication, geographical location, number of participants, type of surgery, and anesthesia.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Perioperative hypertension management in noncardiac surgery — continuation of chronic therapy and target blood pressure: If well tolerated, beta blockers (BBs) should be continued in patients who are currently receiving them for guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) indications, and clinical judgment is useful in titrating BB during the perioperative period with a focus on continuation throughout the hospital stay and at discharge unless clear contraindications arise. In the absence of conclusive randomized controlled trials (RCTs), control of blood pressure (BP) to levels recommended by this guideline (BP < 130/80 mm Hg) or other target levels specified for a particular individual is reasonable before undertaking major elective procedures in either the inpatient or outpatient setting, and if the patient is unable to take oral medications, it is reasonable to use intravenous medications as necessary to control BP. Caution is advised when continuing antihypertensive therapy in patients with low perioperative diastolic BP (DBP), older adults (age ≥ 65 years), and patients in whom the risk for perioperative hypotension is high. Regarding renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system inhibitors (RAASi), evidence from a large cohort study demonstrates that patients who stopped their angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) 24 hours before noncardiac surgery were less likely to suffer the primary composite outcome and intraoperative hypotension than those continuing these medications until surgery, whereas POISE-3 randomized 7490 patients with at least 1 high-risk factor and did not find a significant difference between perioperative discontinuation versus maintenance of ACEi/ARB therapy during the operative and immediate perioperative periods; omitted RAASi before surgery has been shown to reduce intraoperative hypotension, whereas RCTs have failed to prove their continuation or implementation improves clinical outcomes.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Postoperative hypertension — medication resumption and discharge considerations emphasize that delaying the resumption of preoperative ACEi/ARBs was associated with increased 30-day mortality risk, and chronically taken oral antihypertensive medications should be restarted as soon as clinically reasonable to avoid complications from postoperative hypertension. However, in a nonrandomized propensity-matched cohort of men ≥ 65 years with hypertension, intensification of antihypertensive therapy at hospital discharge was cautioned against due to an increased 30-day risk of readmission.

### Association between angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker use prior to major elective surgery and the risk of acute dialysis [^116DS8Wc]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Study strengths and limitations

Our study has several strengths. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest study to describe the association between preoperative ACEi/ARB use and AKI-D (over 230,000 patients from 118 hospitals). We included both cardiac and non-cardiac major surgeries. Unlike other studies, the large number of events of AKI-D (810 events) reduced concerns about statistical overfitting. Given there is < 1% yearly emigration from Ontario, the loss to follow up was minimal. Finally, the information available within the large Ontario health care databases reflects routine clinical practice and may be less prone to participation biases that can arise in other types of studies.

There are several limitations to our study. Due to possible difference in underlying mechanism for the risk of postoperative acute dialysis in emergent surgeries compared to elective surgeries, we excluded emergent surgeries from our analyses. In an emergency situation it is also difficult to manipulate pre-operative medication use. However, exclusion of emergency surgeries may have reduced the generalizability of the study results. We could not determine medication compliance from evidence of a dispensed prescription for ACEi, ARB, or other medications in our data sources. Our study was limited by the absence of key information on perioperative ACEi/ARB use particularly whether it was held prior to surgery and if so when it was held, and when it was restarted after surgery. Important information such as preoperative and intraoperative blood pressure was also not available. These are key elements to guide the optimal and safe use of ACEi/ARB use in the perioperative period, including regimens to be tested in large randomized controlled trials (RCTs). We were also not able to adjust for variables unavailable in our data sources such as body mass index, preoperative proteinuria, non-prescription medication use and in hospital medication use. Another limitation with our data sources is the accuracy of codes for patient related health information. In attempt to limit these concerns, we did use database codes supported by validation studies whenever possible.

### Perioperative angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers for preventing mortality and morbidity in adults [^111p3oTu]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Perioperative hypertension requires careful management. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARBs) have shown efficacy in treating hypertension associated with surgery. However, there is lack of consensus about whether they can prevent mortality and morbidity.

Objectives

To systematically assess the benefits and harms of administration of ACEIs or ARBs perioperatively for the prevention of mortality and morbidity in adults (aged 18 years and above) undergoing any type of surgery under general anaesthesia.

Search Methods

We searched the current issue of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2014, Issue 12), Ovid MEDLINE (1966 to 8 December 2014), EMBASE (1980 to 8 December 2014), and references of the retrieved randomized trials, meta-analyses, and systematic reviews.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing perioperative administration of ACEIs or ARBs with placebo in adults (aged 18 years and above) undergoing any type of surgery under general anaesthesia. We excluded studies in which participants underwent procedures that required local anaesthesia only, or participants who had already been on ACEIs or ARBs.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently performed study selection, assessed the risk of bias, and extracted data. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

We included seven RCTs with a total of 571 participants in the review. Two of the seven trials involved 36 participants undergoing non-cardiac vascular surgery (infrarenal aortic surgery), and five involved 535 participants undergoing cardiac surgery, including valvular surgery, coronary artery bypass surgery, and cardiopulmonary bypass surgery. The intervention was started from 11 days to 25 minutes before surgery in six trials and during surgery in one trial. We considered all seven RCTs to carry a high risk of bias. The effects of ACEIs or ARBs on perioperative mortality and acute myocardial infarction were uncertain because the quality of the evidence was very low. The risk of death was 2.7% in the ACEIs or ARBs group and 1.6% in the placebo group (risk ratio (RR) 1.61; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.44 to 5.85). The risk of acute myocardial infarction was 1.7% in the ACEIs or ARBs group and 3.0% in the placebo group (RR 0.55; 95% CI 0.14 to 2.26). ACEIs or ARBs may improve congestive heart failure (cardiac index) perioperatively (mean difference (MD) -0.60; 95% CI -0.70 to -0.50, very low-quality evidence). In terms of rate of complications, there was no difference in perioperative cerebrovascular complications (RR 0.48; 95% CI 0.18 to 1.28, very low-quality evidence) and hypotension (RR 1.95; 95% CI 0.86 to 4.41, very low-quality evidence). Cardiac surgery-related renal failure was not reported. ACEIs or ARBs were associated with shortened length of hospital stay (MD -0.54; 95% CI -0.93 to -0.16, P value = 0.005, very low-quality evidence). These findings should be interpreted cautiously due to likely confounding by the clinical backgrounds of the participants. ACEIs or ARBs may shorten the length of hospital stay, (MD -0.54; 95% CI -0.93 to -0.16, very low-quality evidence) Two studies reported adverse events, and there was no evidence of a difference between the ACEIs or ARBs and control groups.

Authors' Conclusions

Overall, this review did not find evidence to support that perioperative ACEIs or ARBs can prevent mortality, morbidity, and complications (hypotension, perioperative cerebrovascular complications, and cardiac surgery-related renal failure). We found no evidence showing that the use of these drugs may reduce the rate of acute myocardial infarction. However, ACEIs or ARBs may increase cardiac output perioperatively. Due to the low and very low methodology quality, high risk of bias, and lack of power of the included studies, the true effect may be substantially different from the observed estimates. Perioperative (mainly elective cardiac surgery, according to included studies) initiation of ACEIs or ARBs therapy should be individualized.

### Consequences of continuing renin angiotensin aldosterone system antagonists in the preoperative period: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114yHGqi]. BMC Anesthesiology (2018). Low credibility.

Strengths and limitations

There are some limitations in the present meta-analysis. First, the included studies varied in design and quality, and no RCT was identified that involved a large number of participants. Though a recent study conducted in eight countries involved many patients, it was an observational study. Many potential confounders might limit the statistical power of the results of that study. Secondly, the definition of hypotension or refractory hypotension was not consistent in each study, which might lead to bias of the results. Furthermore, there were no data on the long-term effects of continuing or discontinuing ACEIs/ARBs on the day of surgery, though several studies reported the occurrence of myocardial infarction based on troponin levels and electrocardiogram findings in a short time after surgery, and one study reported postoperative death. Therefore, the above mentioned factors might weaken the results of the present study.

### 2018 ESC / ESH guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^111fToTF]. European Heart Journal (2018). Medium credibility.

Perioperative management of hypertension — surgical timing, BP targets, and medication handling are specified: Postponing necessary surgery is usually not warranted in grade 1 or 2 hypertension, whereas in those with an SBP > 180 mmHg and/or DBP > 110 mmHg, deferring the intervention until BP is reduced or controlled is advisable, except for emergency situations; it is important to avoid large preoperative BP fluctuations, with cohort data showing that maintaining a stable BP with a 70 mmHg threshold for SBP and pre‑induction BP values within 10% difference from the preoperative office SBP reduced postoperative organ dysfunction; there is no clear evidence in favour of against one or another antihypertensive treatment mode in non‑cardiac surgery, so general drug treatment algorithms apply; continuation of beta‑blockers is nevertheless recommended in hypertensive patients on chronic beta‑blocker treatment because abrupt discontinuation may lead to BP or heart rate rebounds, which may also occur with central agents such as clonidine; while the question has been raised whether RAS blockers should be discontinued before surgery, a large international cohort reported that withholding ACE inhibitors or ARBs 24 h before non‑cardiac surgery was associated with a significant reduction in cardiovascular events and mortality 30 days after the intervention.

### Association of preoperative renin-angiotensin system inhibitors with prevention of postoperative atrial fibrillation and adverse events: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111GPSWE]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Methods

This study was performed in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses reporting guideline for conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis. Each individual study included in the systematic review was approved by their own institutional ethics committee, and the informed consent was obtained by each individual study.

Search Strategies

We identified clinical trials that compared the preoperative use of RASIs (treatment group) with no RASIs (control group) in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. An online search of the published literature was performed using the PubMed database and the Cochrane Library from inception until December 31, 2018. The search was developed by using keywords renin-angiotensin system inhibitors OR angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors OR angiotensin receptor blocker OR aldosterone antagonist AND cardiac surgery. An additional search was performed in the ClinicalTrials.gov website from inception until December 31, 2018, using keywords postoperative atrial fibrillation.

Selection Criteria and Study Outcomes

Randomized and observational studies were included in the initial search. The treatment group comprised patients treated with RASIs, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, or aldosterone antagonists, whereas the control group comprised patients who did not receive any RASIs. The study population consisted of patients undergoing CABG or cardiac valvular surgery. The primary outcome was rate of POAF, the identification of which was based on 12-lead electrocardiographic monitoring during the study period. The rates of stroke and mortality and duration of hospitalization were analyzed as secondary outcomes. The selection criteria were predefined, and the search process was conducted by 2 investigators (S.C. and M.G.K.). Discrepancies were resolved by discussions.

Data Extraction and Quality Assessment

Data extraction and presentation followed the recommendations of the PRISMA statement. The data extracted included study characteristics, patient characteristics, treatment, and outcome data. We assessed the methodological quality of the included studies based on the recommendation of the PRISMA statementand the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. The key items were summarized by using the following queries: (1) randomized study? (2) double-blinded? (3) clear definition of study population? (4) clear definition of study comparison? (5) clear definition of outcome assessment? (6) appropriate statistical method used? (7) no selective loss of data analysis? and (8) important confounders identified? Each yes response scored 1 point, and a study assessed with 6 points or more was considered high quality. Discrepancy regarding study quality was resolved by consensus.

### Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging procedure guideline for diagnosis of renovascular hypertension [^116DeLGA]. SNMMI (2022). High credibility.

ACE inhibitor (ACEI) renography patient preparation — Patients need to be well hydrated before testing; if an oral ACEI is used, patients should drink only water and should not eat a solid meal within 4 h of the study, and one suggested protocol is 7 mL water/kg body weight ingested at a minimum of 30 and preferably 60 min before the study; an intravenous line should be placed in high-risk patients and in those receiving intravenous enalaprilat. The sensitivity of ACEI renography may be reduced in patients receiving ACEIs; short-acting ACEIs, such as captopril, should be withheld for 3 d before the study, and longer acting ACEIs should be withheld for 5–7 d; angiotensin II receptor blockers such as losartan may have an effect comparable to ACE inhibitors, and these drugs also should be discontinued before ACEI renography. When patients have not discontinued therapeutic ACEIs or angiotensin II receptor blocking agents, it is acceptable to proceed with the understanding that there may be a slight loss in sensitivity; most practitioners give the test ACEI (captopril or enalaprilat), and the chances of a hypotensive response are low. Chronic administration of diuretics may lead to volume depletion resulting in a decrease in specificity and may potentiate the effects of ACE inhibition, leading to an increased risk of symptomatic hypotension; if possible, chronic diuretic administration should be stopped several days before the study.

### The risk of hypertension after preoperative discontinuation of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor antagonists in ambulatory and same-day admission patients [^114R3tYA]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The continued use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II subtype I receptor antagonists (ARBs) medications in the preoperative period has been reported to be associated with intraoperative hypotension that can be unresponsive to pressor drugs. As a result, several investigators suggested discontinuation of these medications before scheduled surgery but did not report on unintended consequences that might result from discontinuation. We conducted a prospective, single-blind, randomized trial to observe the effect of the medications on preoperative arterial blood pressure recordings in patients presenting for ambulatory and same-day surgery.

Methods

Six hundred forty-four patients presenting for ambulatory and same-day surgery were enrolled prospectively between 2006 and 2011 and randomly assigned to 2 groups based on continuation or discontinuation of ACEIs and ARBs. An intention-to-treat analysis was performed. The primary outcome was presence of hypertension (HTN) immediately before surgery. Secondary outcomes included surgical cancellations due to HTN, prolongation of hospitalization, adverse clinical events, and HTN in the postoperative period.

Results

Data for 526 patients were analyzed. There were 262 patients in the discontinuation group and 264 patients in the continuation group. Discontinuation of ACEIs and ARBs on the day of surgery was not associated with increased prevalence of preoperative HTN (P = 0.775). The upper bound of a 95% confidence interval for the difference in prevalence of Stage 1 and 2 HTN between study arms indicates that discontinuation of study medication is unlikely to be associated with an increase in Stage 1 HTN of > 4.8 percentage points and in Stage 2 HTN of no > 5.8 percentage points. Discontinuation was not associated with an increase in postoperative HTN, with prolongation of hospitalization or with adverse clinical events.

Conclusions

Discontinuing ACEIs and ARBs in patients on the day of surgery did not result in a substantively increased incidence of pre- or postoperative HTN compared with patients who continued these medications on the day of surgery. The results provide an evidentiary basis for the safety of discontinuing ACEIs and ARBs on the day of surgery without increasing adverse hemodynamic outcomes.

### Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system inhibition is safe in the preoperative period surrounding carotid endarterectomy [^1159zpt5]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

Discontinuation of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) medications before surgery has been suggested because of the potentially deleterious effects of hypotension. We investigated the effect of preoperative ACEI and/or ARB use on early outcomes after carotid endarterectomy (CEA).

Methods

We examined 3752 consecutive CEA patients within the Vascular Study Group of New England from September 2012 to September 2014 and compared outcomes for patients treated (n = 1772) or not treated (n = 1980) with ACEI and/or ARB preoperatively. Outcomes included perioperative need for intravenous vasoactive medication (IVBPmed) for hypotension or hypertension (HTN), major adverse cardiac events (MACEs), and the combined outcome of stroke or death. Adjusted analysis was performed using multivariable logistic regression of the crude cohort and by constructing a propensity score matched cohort (n = 1441).

Results

ACEI and/or ARB users were more likely to be male (64% vs 59%; p = 0.001), with a higher prevalence of diabetes (41% vs 28%; P < .0001), HTN (97% vs 82%; P < .0001), coronary artery disease (31% vs 25%; p = 0.0001), congestive heart failure (10% vs 8%; p = 0.02), and asymptomatic carotid disease (59% vs 54%; p = 0.004). Patients who received ACEI and/or ARB preoperatively were more likely to be treated with aspirin (92% vs 88%; p = 0.0002) and statins (89% vs 85%; p = 0.001) preoperatively. In the unadjusted analysis, no significant differences were identified in hypotension that required IVBPmed (12% vs 11%; odds ratio [OR], 1.1; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.9–1.4; p = 0.22), MACE (3% vs 2%; OR, 1.3; 95% CI, 0.8–1.9; p = 0.32), or stroke or death (3% vs 3%; OR, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.7–1.6; p = 0.89) for preoperative ACEI and/or ARB treated and nontreated patients, respectively. Preoperative ACEI and/or ARB usage was, however, associated with HTN that required IVBPmed (13% vs 10%; OR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.1–1.6; p = 0.01). Analysis of the propensity score matched cohort revealed no significant differences in hypotension that required IVBPmed (12% vs 12%; OR, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.8–1.3; p = 0.86), MACE (3% vs 2%; OR, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.7–1.8; p = 0.62;), or stroke or death (3% vs 3%; OR, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.7–1.6; p = 0.91) for patients treated or not treated with preoperative ACEI and/or ARB, respectively. ACEI and/or ARB remained associated with HTN that required IVBPmed (13% vs 10%; OR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.0–1.7; p = 0.02). Results were similar after adjustment using logistic regression. The incidence of hospital length of stay > 1 day was similar between ACEI and/or ARB treated and not treated patients (29% vs 32%; OR, 0.9; 95% CI, 0.8–1.1; p = 0.21).

Conclusions

Preoperative ACEI and/or ARB use was associated with marginally increased use of IVBPmed for HTN but not for hypotension and was not associated with increased MACE, stroke, or death. On the basis of these metrics, the use of preoperative ACEI and/or ARB appears safe before CEA.

### Preoperative renin-angiotensin system antagonists intake and blood pressure responses during ambulatory surgical procedures: a prospective cohort study [^1166pTLm]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

There is limited evidence to inform the association between the intake of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs)/angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) and intraoperative blood pressure (BP) changes in an ambulatory surgery population.

Methods

Adult patients who underwent ambulatory surgery and were discharged on the same day or within 24 hours of their procedure were enrolled in this prospective cohort study. The primary outcome of the study was early intraoperative hypotension (first 15 minutes of induction). Secondary outcomes included any hypotension, BP variability, and recovery. Hypotension was defined as a decrease in systolic BP of > 30% from baseline for ≥ 5 minutes or a mean BP of < 55 mm Hg. Four exposure groups were compared (no antihypertensives, ACEI/ARB intake < 10 hours before surgery, ACEI/ARB intake ≥ 10 hours before surgery, and other antihypertensives).

Results

Of the 537 participants, early hypotension was observed in 25% (n = 134), and any hypotension in 41.5% (n = 223). Early hypotension occurred in 30% (29 of 98) and 41% (17 of 41) with the intake of ACEI/ARBs < 10 and ≥ 10 hours before surgery, respectively, compared to 30% (9 of 30) with other antihypertensives and 21% (79 of 368) with no antihypertensives (P = 0.02). Those on antihypertensives also experienced any hypotension more frequently than those who were not on antihypertensives (P < .001). After adjusting for age and baseline BP in a regression analysis, antihypertensive exposure groups were observed to be associated only with any intraoperative hypotension (P = 0.012). In the ACEI/ARB subset, there was no evidence of an association between time since the last ACEI/ARB dose, and hypotension or minimum mean or systolic BP. Compared to normal baseline BP, BP ≥ 140/90 mm Hg increased the odds of early and any hypotension (odds ratio [OR], 3.9; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.1–7.1 and OR, 7.7; 95% CI, 3.7–14.9, respectively; P < .001). Intraoperative variability in systolic and diastolic BP demonstrated significant differences with age, baseline BP, and antihypertensive exposure group (P < .001).

Conclusions

Early and any hypotension occurred more frequently in those on antihypertensives than those not on antihypertensives. Unadjusted associations between antihypertensive exposure and intraoperative hypotension were largely explained by baseline hypertension rather than the timing of ACEI/ARBs or type of antihypertensive exposure. Patients with hypertension and on treatment experience more intraoperative BP variability and should be monitored appropriately.

### Comparison of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blocker management strategies before cardiac surgery: a pilot randomized controlled registry trial [^116Pw9xb]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Limitations

First, in this registry‐based RCT, intraoperative hemodynamic variables were not recorded. Multiple previous studies have documented the postinduction risk of hypotension associated with ACEI or ARB continuation, and the purpose of this study was to evaluate postoperative hemodynamic and clinical outcomes. 33, 37 Second, the study was not blinded and perioperative administration of other cardiac medications was left to the discretion of the most responsible physician. Third, given the lack of a consensus definition of vasoplegic shock, we developed a pragmatic definition that requires validation in future studies. Fourth, the study did not collect information on bleeding or hypertensive urgencies, although the incidence and duration of intravenous vasodilators were similar in both treatment arms. Finally, the study primarily enrolled patients undergoing isolated CABG with preserved left ventricular function and kidney function. Recognizing the association among ventricular function, length of cardiopulmonary bypass, and risk of vasoplegia, the study results may not apply to other surgical populations. 17

### The association of withholding or continuing angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin 2 receptor blockers on acute kidney injury after non-cardiac surgery [^116gwfGh]. Anaesthesia (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Withholding or continuing angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin 2 receptor blockers peri-operatively in non-cardiac surgery remains controversial as they may result in intra-operative hypotension and postoperative organ damage.

Methods

We included patients prescribed angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin 2 receptor blockers who underwent surgical procedures > 1h duration under general or spinal anaesthesia from January 2012 to June 2022 in a single centre. We categorised patients by whether these drugs were withheld for 24h before surgery. We evaluated the association of withholding these drugs before non-cardiac surgery with creatinine concentrations that increased ≥ 26.4μmol.l -1 in the first 48 postoperative hours (acute kidney injury). We also analysed changes in creatinine concentrations and estimated glomerular filtration rates.

Results

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin 2 receptor blockers were withheld in 24,285 of 32,933 (74%) patients and continued in 8648 (26%) patients. We used propensity scores for drug discontinuation to match 8631 patient pairs who did or did not continue these drugs: acute kidney injury was recorded for 1791 (21%) patients who continued these drugs vs. 1587 (18%) who did not (OR (95%CI) 1.16 (1.08–1.25), p < 0.001). Intra-operative hypotension was recorded for 3892 (45%) patients who continued drugs vs. 3373 (39%) patients who did not (OR (95%CI) 1.28 (1.21–1.36), p < 0.001). Continuing drugs was independently associated with a mean increase in creatinine of 2.2μmol.l -1 (p < 0.001) and a mean decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate of 1.4ml.min.1.73m -2 (p < 0.001).

Conclusions

Continuing angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin 2 receptor blockers 24h before non-cardiac surgery was associated with intra-operative hypotension and postoperative acute kidney injury.

### Perioperative Quality Initiative (POQI) international consensus statement on perioperative arterial pressure management [^112Qf2zU]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2024). Medium credibility.

Hypotension is common in postoperative patients because of antihypertensive medications, inadequate intravenous fluid administration, adverse effects of some anaesthetic drugs, intraoperative and ongoing blood loss, the inflammatory response to surgery, arrhythmias, and impaired myocardial function. Most hospitals therefore establish guidance on when to alert medical staff, for example, when systolic arterial pressure is < 90 mm Hg. Postoperative hypotension often goes undetected, and lasts longer than intraoperative hypotension.

Large observational studies have identified associations between postoperative hypotension and organ injury, especially acute kidney injury, cardiovascular events, readmission, and mortality. Harm thresholds appear to be an absolute systolic arterial pressure of 90–100 mm Hg or a mean arterial pressure of 60–75 mm Hg. Longer cumulative duration of postoperative hypotension is associated with higher risk.

A challenge is that it has proven difficult to modify postoperative arterial pressures. For example, a delayed restart of chronic antihypertensive medications has no appreciable effect on ward arterial pressures. Trials show that avoiding beta blockersand clonidinereduces the risk of hypotension. Observational analyses suggest that avoiding angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers also reduces hypotension. However, in the SPACE trial, a six-centre trial of 262 patients aged ≥ 60 yr who had elective noncardiac surgery, discontinuing vs continuing angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers did not reduce myocardial injury or hypotension within 48 h of surgery. Beta blockers reduce the risk of myocardial injury but cause hypotension (and strokes). Avoiding clonidine does not reduce organ injury despite less severe hypotension. The effects of avoiding perioperative angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers need to be evaluated in further trials. It thus remains unclear whether postoperative hypotension is causally related to organ injury.

Perioperative and 1‐Year Outcomes Stratified by the Incidence of Postoperative Hypotension

On univariable analysis, patients with preoperative and no RAASIs intake had higher risk of perioperative stroke (6.2% versus 3.5% versus 3%, P < 0.001), death (2.8% versus 0.9% versus 0.5%, P < 0.001), and stroke or death (8% versus 4.1% versus 3.4%, P < 0.001) compared with patients with continuous intake among patients with no postoperative hypotension. When looking at patients with postoperative hypotension, patients with preoperative and no intake had higher risk of perioperative stroke (7.1% versus 5.4% versus 4.2%, P = 0.001), death (4.5% versus 2.8% versus 0.8%, P < 0.001), and stroke or death (10.2% versus 4.8% versus 7.4%, P < 0.001) compared with patients with continuous intake (Table 4). After adjusting for potential confounders, and when looking at patients with no postoperative hypotension, preoperative and no intake were associated with higher odds of postoperative stroke, death, and stroke/death, respectively. At 1 year, preoperative and no intake were associated with higher odds of stroke, death, and stroke/death (Table 5 and Figure 2).

### American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery: postoperative care pathway guidelines for roux-en-Y gastric bypass [^116bbAjL]. Surgery for Obesity and Related Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) — antihypertensive medications should be managed proactively; the need for antihypertensive medications should be evaluated repeatedly and frequently during the active phase of weight loss, as RYGB has been associated with hypertension resolution in a significant proportion of patients with preexisting hypertension and may occur as early as 1 week postoperatively. Frequent monitoring and adjustment of antihypertensive medications to prevent sequelae of hypotension is recommended. Selective guidance specifies that diuretics should be restarted with caution, especially in the early postoperative period; angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) should be continued or restarted early after RYGB, because the discontinuation of ACE inhibitors or ARBs has been found to be independently associated with an increased risk for acute kidney injury; and beta-blockers may be restarted after RYGB, with limited studies showing no difference in the bioavailability of immediate and controlled-release metoprolol after RYGB.

Step 2 treatment

If blood pressure is not controlled by Step 1 treatment, use a CCB in combination with either an ACE inhibitor or an ARB.

If a CCB is not suitable for Step 2 treatment, for example because of oedema or intolerance, or if there is evidence of heart failure or a high risk of heart failure, offer a thiazide‐like diuretic.

For Black patients of African or Caribbean family origin, consider an ARB in preference to an ACE inhibitor, in combination with a CCB.

Step 3 treatment

Before considering Step 3 treatment, check that drugs from Step 2 have been prescribed at optimal doses, or at the maximum tolerated doses. If treatment with three drugs is required, the combination of ACE inhibitor or ARB, CCB and thiazide‐like diuretic should be used.

### Association between angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker use prior to major elective surgery and the risk of acute dialysis [^115Pew9D]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a serious complication of major surgery and severe AKI requires treatment with acute dialysis. Annually 230 million patients undergo major surgery worldwide and around one million major surgeries are complicated by AKI treated with dialysis (AKI-D). The development of AKI is associated with increased morbidity, mortality, and health care expenditures. A patient's risk for developing postoperative AKI is influenced by a variety of clinical factors including pre-existing comorbidities (e.g. chronic kidney disease (CKD), congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, diabetes, hypertension), clinical factors around the time of surgery (e.g. volume depletion, blood loss, hypotension, administration of vasoconstrictors), type of surgery (e.g. cardiac, vascular), and certain medications used in the perioperative period (e.g. antihypertensive medications). Medication use prior to surgery is of particular interest given the possibility of modification prior to planned elective surgeries.

Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) and angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) are frequently prescribed medications. Despite their demonstrated benefits in outpatient settings, their continued use in the perioperative period remains controversial as preoperative ACEi/ARB use may lead to the development of perioperative hypotension and subsequent AKI. However, previous observational studies on the association between preoperative ACEi/ARB use and AKI have had conflicting results, and have focused on milder forms of AKI rather than the most serious renal outcome of AKI-D. We conducted this large retrospective cohort study to test the hypothesis that preoperative ACEi/ARB use compared to non-use associates with a different risk of AKI-D following major elective surgery.

### Continuation versus discontinuation of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors before noncardiac surgery: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^113k77o8]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The optimal management of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RASIs) before noncardiac surgery remains unclear. Continuing RASIs may increase intraoperative hypotension, while discontinuation risks postoperative hypertension and heart failure. Current guidelines suggest withholding RASI 24 hours prior to surgery, but evidence is limited. This meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials aimed to clarify the risks and benefits of continuing versus withholding RASIs in this setting.

Design

A systematic review of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and meta-analysis.

Setting

A comprehensive electronic search conducted in PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane from inception to August 2024.

Participants

Nine clinical trials that collectively enrolled 8,906 patients undergoing noncardiac surgery.

Interventions

A comparison of continuation versus discontinuation of RASIs preoperatively in patients undergoing noncardiac surgery.

Measurements and Main Results

The primary outcomes were intraoperative hypotension, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), and all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes included acute kidney injury (AKI) and postoperative hypertension. Patients who discontinued RASIs had a significantly lower incidence of intraoperative hypotension (risk ratio [RR], 0.66; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.52–0.84) compared to those who continued treatment. No significant differences were observed in all-cause mortality (RR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.40–1.85), MACE (RR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.87–1.17), AKI (RR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.79–1.22), and postoperative hypertension (RR, 1.57; 95% CI, 0.92–2.68).

Conclusions

Continuation of RASIs significantly increased the risk of intraoperative hypotension compared to discontinuation of treatment. Overall, no significant differences were observed in all-cause mortality, MACE, AKI, or postoperative hypertension between patients who continued or discontinued RASIs preoperatively.

Patients scheduled for surgical procedures — perioperative antihypertensive management and surgical timing: In patients with hypertension scheduled for major surgery who have been on BBs chronically, BBs should be continued throughout the perioperative period to assist with BP control (1, B-NR). In patients with hypertension scheduled for elective major surgery, it is reasonable to continue most medications for hypertension throughout the perioperative period (2a, C-EO). In patients with hypertension scheduled for major surgery, discontinuation of ACEI or ARB preoperatively may be considered to prevent hypotension during surgery (2b, B-R). In patients scheduled for elective major surgery with SBP ≥ 180 mm Hg or DBP ≥ 110 mm Hg, deferring surgery may be considered especially in high-risk patients to minimize perioperative complications (2b, C-LD). In patients with hypertension scheduled for surgery, abrupt preoperative discontinuation of BB or clonidine may result in rebound hypertension and is potentially harmful (3: Harm, B-NR). For patients with hypertension scheduled for surgery, BB should not be started on the day of surgery in BB-naive patients because of increased risk of postoperative mortality (3: Harm, B-R).

### Comparison of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blocker management strategies before cardiac surgery: a pilot randomized controlled registry trial [^113xffz4]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

A pragmatic randomized clinical study of preoperative ACEI or ARB continuation or discontinuation in patients undergoing cardiac surgery was feasible, and no differences were observed in the incidence of vasoplegic shock, postoperative intravenous vasopressors or vasodilators requirements, AKI, duration of mechanical ventilation, or CSICU LOS between study arms. These findings suggest that preoperative ACEI/ARB management is not associated with postcardiac surgery hemodynamic outcomes. These findings may serve to inform the design and event rates of a larger future randomized trial.

Regarding medical management for perioperative cardiac risk management for noncardiac surgery, more specifically with respect to management of RAAS inhibitors inhibitors, CCS 2017 guidelines recommend to withhold ACEis/ARBs starting 24 hours before NCS in patients treated chronically with ACEis/ARBs.

Management of Angiotensin-converting Enzyme Inhibitors and Angiotensin Receptor Blockers

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers have been hypothesized to increase the risk for AKI through a variety of mechanisms, including systemic hypotension, renal artery constriction, and interstitial nephritis. Recommendations and practice for the management of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers in the perioperative period are conflicting. The American College of Cardiology (Bethesda, Maryland) and American Heart Association (Dallas, Texas) recommending continuing during noncardiac surgery, while anesthesia groups routinely hold on the day of surgery due to concerns of intraoperative hypotension. Subanalysis of the Vascular events In noncardiac Surgery patIents cOhort evaluatioN (VISION) cohort found that withholding angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers before major noncardiac surgery was associated with a lower risk of death and postoperative vascular events, although this study was not designed to assess renal outcomes. This contrasts with an earlier meta-analysis that did not demonstrate a difference in mortality, morbidity, and complications between patients who continued or held their angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers in the perioperative period. In the largest prospective study to date in major elective noncardiac surgery, conducted by the Student Audit and Research in Surgery (STARSurg) Collaborative, withholding angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers did not protect against the development of postoperative AKI. The POQI-3 consensus statement recommends restarting angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blocker therapy within the first 48 h postoperatively in patients, as long as the patient is hemodynamically stable and not exhibiting signs of postoperative AKI.
