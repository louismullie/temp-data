## Question

Is prednisone an appropriate treatment for eczema?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether prednisone (a systemic corticosteroid) is an appropriate treatment for eczema (atopic dermatitis). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what high-credibility guidelines state about systemic corticosteroids in atopic dermatitis. Then, I should verify any narrowly defined circumstances in which prednisone might be used and the recommended duration. Next, I will review risks, including rebound and systemic adverse effects. After that, I need to compare prednisone to standard first-line therapies and modern systemic options for severe disease. Finally, I will synthesize a decision framework and make a clear recommendation, cross-checking with EuroGuiDerm 2025, European consensus 2018, AAD 2023, and AAAAI/ACAAI 2024 guidance as I go.

> Let me first confirm the top-line stance so I don't jump to conclusions: contemporary guidelines consistently advise against routine use of systemic corticosteroids for atopic dermatitis and restrict their role, at most, to brief rescue of acute flares in exceptional situations, not as maintenance or first-line therapy [^114QAtwa] [^113AYwQb].

> Wait, let me verify the exact language from the European living guideline: the EuroGuiDerm/EDF 2025 update specifies that systemic corticosteroids should be considered only as rescue therapy for acute flares in atopic eczema, which implies nonroutine, time-limited use with a concurrent long-term plan that does not involve systemic steroids [^114QAtwa].

> I need to check the older but still influential European consensus for specifics on duration and patient selection: the 2018 EAACI/EADV/EDF/EFA/ESDaP/ESPD/ETFAD/UEMS guidance advises short-term oral corticosteroids, up to one week, only for treating an acute flare in exceptional cases, and largely limits such use to adults with severe disease, emphasizing restriction rather than repetition [^113AYwQb].

> Hold on, I should review the risk profile because benefit must outweigh harm in any rescue scenario: systemic corticosteroids carry a high risk of rebound exacerbation after discontinuation in atopic dermatitis, and even short courses can cause hyperglycemia, hypertension, mood disturbances, increased infection risk, fractures, and venous thromboembolism, while offering no disease-modifying benefit, which has been reinforced by expert consensus and primary care safety data as well as early termination signals in a prednisolone trial due to flares [^113AYwQb] [^1154T5Jf] [^117JZ6LE].

> Let me consider pediatric use specifically, because I need to ensure age-appropriate recommendations: guidelines caution against systemic corticosteroids in children, with the 2018 European consensus restricting consideration largely to adults, and IEC experts agreeing they should generally be avoided and used even more rarely, if at all, in children, noting that consensus on "never in children" was not fully reached but the weight of opinion is to avoid [^114KmSet] [^1135RnSF] [^1156F5bs].

> Next, I should review what constitutes appropriate first-line care so prednisone is not misused out of convenience: strong recommendations endorse emollients as background therapy, topical corticosteroids as the mainstay for flares, topical calcineurin inhibitors for steroid-sparing and sensitive areas, and proactive intermittent therapy to prevent relapse, with network meta-analyses and modern guidelines supporting the effectiveness of potent TCS and tacrolimus for symptom control [^116sXU2x] [^116gbFE5] [^113CfdL9].

> I will now examine alternatives for severe or refractory disease where someone might otherwise reach for prednisone: modern systemic options such as dupilumab and tralokinumab, and conventional immunomodulators like ciclosporin, methotrexate, or azathioprine, are preferred pathways for sustained control rather than systemic corticosteroids, with randomized and review data supporting efficacy and positioning in treatment paradigms [^1133bUzU] [^1163DNVE].

> But wait, what if a patient presents with a severe, acute flare needing immediate relief or requires a bridge while initiating another systemic therapy? In those exceptional circumstances, limited adult use can be considered as a single, very short course with close follow-up and a definitive long-term plan that does not involve repeated systemic steroid bursts, consistent with European consensus and IEC statements; I should double-check duration: the 2018 consensus says up to one week, while an EADV/ETFAD task force position once described an example methylprednisolone regimen lasting longer, but that example lacked RCT support and conflicts with the stricter " ≤ 1 week" consensus, so I will prioritize the shorter, evidence-aligned ceiling and caution against repeating bursts [^114KmSet] [^113AYwQb] [^1156F5bs].

> In summary, I need to ensure my recommendation is clear and actionable: prednisone is not appropriate for routine treatment of eczema and should be avoided except as rare, short-term rescue for an acute severe flare in adults, ideally as a bridge to effective nonsteroid long-term therapy, with explicit plans for optimized topical regimens and/or modern systemic agents; it should not be used for maintenance, should be avoided in children, and carries substantial rebound and systemic risks that outweigh benefits for chronic management [^114QAtwa] [^114KmSet] [^112Utrqz] [^113AYwQb].

---

No, prednisone is **not appropriate for routine eczema care**. It is only for **short-term rescue** in severe flares when other options are unavailable [^114QAtwa] or as a bridge to safer systemic therapy [^114KmSet]. Prednisone is not for long-term use due to **rebound and adverse effects** [^1154T5Jf]; use topical corticosteroids [^116sXU2x], calcineurin inhibitors [^116wE947], or dupilumab for maintenance [^1133bUzU].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines and expert consensus statements consistently **advise against routine use** of systemic corticosteroids, including prednisone, for eczema [^113yRupp]. The International Eczema Council (IEC) states that systemic corticosteroids should **generally be avoided** and considered only in exceptional circumstances — such as severe acute flares, when other options are unavailable, or as a short-term bridge to systemic therapies or phototherapy [^113yRupp] [^113AYwQb]. The European guideline (EuroGuiDerm, 2025) similarly recommends systemic corticosteroids **only as rescue therapy** for acute flares in patients with atopic dermatitis, emphasizing their limited role and prioritizing alternative treatments [^114QAtwa].

---

## Risks and adverse effects of prednisone in eczema management

Prednisone, like other systemic corticosteroids, carries **significant risks and adverse effects**, particularly with long-term or repeated use [^1154T5Jf]. These include:

- **Rebound flares**: Rapid recurrence or worsening of eczema symptoms upon discontinuation of prednisone, often more severe than the initial flare [^113yRupp].

- **Immunosuppression**: Increased susceptibility to infections, including bacterial, viral, and fungal infections.

- **Metabolic effects**: Hyperglycemia, weight gain, hypertension, and dyslipidemia [^1154T5Jf].

- **Musculoskeletal effects**: Osteoporosis, muscle weakness, and increased risk of fractures [^112YcZPn].

- **Psychiatric effects**: Mood disturbances, anxiety, depression, and insomnia [^1154T5Jf].

- **Dermatologic effects**: Skin atrophy, striae, and delayed wound healing [^112YcZPn].

Given these risks, prednisone is **not recommended for long-term eczema management** and should be limited to short-term courses (typically less than one week) [^114KmSet] in exceptional cases [^1156F5bs].

---

## Alternative treatments for eczema

Current guidelines **recommend several alternatives** for eczema management:

- **Topical corticosteroids**: First-line therapy for acute flares [^114QAtwa] and maintenance treatment, with careful consideration of potency, duration, and application technique [^116sXU2x] [^113CfdL9].

- **Topical calcineurin inhibitors**: Recommended for sensitive skin areas (face, intertriginous sites, anogenital area) [^1121cYzF] and as steroid-sparing agents [^116wE947].

- **Emollients and moisturizers**: Essential for maintaining skin barrier function [^114xj2Qu] and preventing flares [^117XGrw5].

- **Systemic immunomodulatory agents**: Such as methotrexate, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, and cyclosporine, recommended for moderate-to-severe eczema unresponsive to topical therapies [^114KmSet] [^114aHnb3].

- **Biologic therapies**: Dupilumab, an IL-4 receptor antagonist, has demonstrated significant efficacy and safety in moderate-to-severe eczema [^1133bUzU] and is recommended by current guidelines [^114aHnb3].

---

## Clinical scenarios where prednisone may be considered

Prednisone **may be considered** in specific scenarios, including:

- **Severe acute flares**: Short-term use (less than one week) [^114KmSet] in exceptional cases where rapid symptom control is necessary.

- **Bridge therapy**: Temporary use while initiating other systemic therapies or phototherapy [^113yRupp].

- **Lack of alternative options**: When other treatments are contraindicated or unavailable [^113yRupp].

In all cases, prednisone use should be **carefully monitored**, with a long-term plan that avoids systemic corticosteroids [^113yRupp] [^114QAtwa].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Prednisone is **not appropriate for routine management of eczema** because of significant risks, adverse effects, and the potential for rebound flares [^113yRupp]. Its use should be limited to **short-term rescue therapy** in exceptional cases, with careful monitoring and a clear plan for alternative long-term management [^114QAtwa]. Current guidelines strongly recommend topical corticosteroids, topical calcineurin inhibitors, emollients, and systemic immunomodulatory or biologic therapies as safer and more effective alternatives for eczema management.

When making cross-trial comparisons, it is important to consider the following elements of JADE DARE: Because of the lack of a placebo comparator, all patients received active therapy. Therefore, any improvement from baseline might include any potential placebo response in addition to a response to study treatment.

Washout of topical corticosteroids (TCS) prior to treatment initiation was not required. Rescue treatment, which could include high-potency TCS for up to two weeks at a time or systemic corticosteroids for up to ten days, to manage intolerable atopic dermatitis (AD) symptoms was allowed after week four at investigators' discretion.

- **Concomitant TCS use**: This was standardized by the protocol to medium- or low-potency TCS (e.g. triamcinolone acetonide 0.1% cream or fluocinolone acetonide 0.025% ointment), but not provided by the trial sponsor. The frequency and amount used were not reported. Alternatively, topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCI) or phosphodiesterase inhibitors were allowed on areas of thin skin or if TCS were considered unsafe.

- **Data handling**: Non-responder imputation (NRI) was implemented for those patients who used rescue medication or withdrew from the trial. Other missing data were assumed to be missing at random.

- **Placebo-controlled phase III trials**

- **ECZTRA 3 (Tralokinumab)**: ECZTRA 3 (NCT03363854) was a 32-week, phase III, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial comparing tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W + TCS (n = 252) with placebo + TCS (n = 126) for an initial 16-week treatment period in patients aged ≥ 18 years with moderate to severe AD. The initial treatment period was followed by re-randomization for an additional 16-week continuation.

### A clinician's paradigm in the treatment of atopic dermatitis [^112N1UCu]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Successful management of atopic dermatitis requires a multipronged approach that includes skin barrier function care, the use of topical or systemic agents, and the identification and elimination of precipitating or exacerbating factors. Because the origin of atopic dermatitis is multifactorial and trigger factors differ among patients, treatment plans must be specific to the individual patient. This article offers an example of a permutational, or flexible, treatment paradigm.

The approach utilizes four topical regimens as initial therapy in a variety of induction protocols, determined by the severity of a patient's condition and history:

- **High-potency topical corticosteroids**
- **Lowest effective potency topical corticosteroids**
- **Topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCIs)**
- **Topical corticosteroid/TCI combinations**:

The paradigm permits treatment to progress from a chosen induction therapy to maintenance therapy. During the patient's induction therapy, as soon as an acceptable level of clearance is achieved, therapy should be adjusted to a maintenance regimen. This could involve monotherapy with either a TCI or a lowest effective potency topical corticosteroid (the latter used intermittently) or an alternation of the two agents. If there is no clearance or positive response with the initial induction protocol, the clinician should move to one of the alternative regimens.

### Use of systemic corticosteroids for atopic dermatitis: International Eczema Council consensus statement [^116CeFCp]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

The majority (65%) disagreed that nonresponse to topical therapy was an indication for the use of systemic corticosteroids (CS). Consensus was reached that among the appropriate circumstances for the use of systemic CS in atopic dermatitis (AD) were a lack of other viable treatment options, as a bridge to other systemic therapies or phototherapy, acute flares in need of immediate relief, anticipation of a major life event, or in the most severe cases. Furthermore, it was agreed that, if used, systemic CS treatment of severe AD should be limited to short-term use.

Participants, in their responses to open-ended questions, qualified their responses in several ways. Some expressed strong support for the use of systemic CS, while others expressed strong opposition.

- **Sensitivity analysis**: Using less than 20% disagreement as a more stringent cut-off, only five statements would have reached consensus (Box S1; see Supporting Information). Alternatively, in the sensitivity analysis where no more than 30% of voters marked within the left two-thirds of the visual analog scale (VAS), counting more of the 'neutral' range as disagreement, only three statements would have reached consensus (Box S2; see Supporting Information).

### What's new in atopic eczema? An analysis of systematic reviews published in 2015. Part 2: Prevention and treatment [^1158CSEr]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

This review forms part of a series of annual updates that summarize the evidence base for atopic eczema (AE), providing a succinct guide for clinicians and patients. It provides a summary of key findings from 26 systematic reviews published during 2015, focusing on the treatment and prevention of AE. For systematic reviews on the epidemiology and methodological issues, see Part 1 of this update.

Topical corticosteroid withdrawal syndrome, also known as 'steroid addiction', has been evaluated in a high-quality systematic review, which better defines this entity and its risk factors. A Cochrane Review has not demonstrated any association between topical corticosteroid use in pregnancy and adverse outcomes, although very large quantities of potent or very potent topical corticosteroids may be associated with reduced birth weight. House dust mite avoidance strategies do not appear to prevent AE.

Exposure to probiotics prenatally and in early infancy may help prevent AE, but there is no evidence that maternal diet or supplementation has a preventative effect.

### Prednisone [^117CF1AN]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

**Dosage and administration**: The initial dosage of prednisone tablets, USP, may vary from 5 mg to 60 mg per day, depending on the specific disease entity being treated. In situations of less severity, lower doses will generally suffice, while in selected patients, higher initial doses may be required. The initial dosage should be maintained or adjusted until a satisfactory response is noted. If, following a reasonable period of time, there is a lack of satisfactory clinical response, prednisone should be discontinued and the patient transferred to other appropriate therapy. It should be emphasized that dosage requirements are variable and must be individualized based on the disease under treatment and the patient's response. After a favorable response is noted, the proper maintenance dosage should be determined by decreasing the initial drug dosage in small decrements at appropriate time intervals until the lowest dosage that will maintain an adequate clinical response is reached. Constant monitoring is needed regarding drug dosage. Situations requiring dosage adjustments include changes in clinical status due to remissions or exacerbations in the disease process, the patient's individual drug responsiveness, and patient exposure to stressful situations not directly related to the disease entity under treatment. In such situations, it may be necessary to increase the dosage of prednisone for a period of time consistent with the patient's condition.

### Topical anti-inflammatory treatments for eczema: A Cochrane systematic review and network meta-analysis [^114axaz3]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2024). Low credibility.

Eczema is the most burdensome skin condition worldwide, and topical anti-inflammatory treatments are commonly used to control symptoms. However, the relative effectiveness and safety of different topical anti-inflammatory treatments remain uncertain.

A network meta-analysis was performed within a Cochrane systematic review to compare and statistically rank the efficacy and safety of topical anti-inflammatory eczema treatments. Data sources included the Cochrane Skin Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and trial registries up to June 2023.

The trials included in this review were either within-participant or between-participant randomized controlled trials. Participants had eczema that was not clinically infected and was not categorized as contact dermatitis, seborrheic eczema, or hand eczema. The interventions were topical anti-inflammatory treatments, excluding complementary treatments, antibiotics alone, wet wraps, phototherapy, or systemic treatments. Comparators were either no treatment/vehicle or another topical anti-inflammatory.

Among the 291 trials identified, involving 45,846 participants, most were conducted in high-income countries and were industry-funded, with a median treatment duration of 3 weeks. The risk of bias, assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 tool, was high in 89% of trials, primarily due to risk of selective reporting. The network meta-analysis of binary outcomes ranked potent and/or very potent topical steroids, tacrolimus 0.1%, and ruxolitinib 1.5% as some of the most effective treatments for improving patient-reported symptoms and clinician-reported signs.

### Clinical practice guidelines for the management of atopic dermatitis 2018 [^111LeAVZ]. The Journal of Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a disease characterized by relapsing eczema, with pruritus as a primary lesion. Strategies to treat AD in Japan, from the perspective of evidence-based medicine, consist of three primary measures:

- **Main treatment for inflammation**: Use of topical corticosteroids and tacrolimus ointment.
- **Cutaneous barrier dysfunction**: Topical application of emollients.
- **Avoidance strategies**: Avoidance of apparent exacerbating factors, psychological counseling, and advice about daily life.

The guidelines present recommendations to review clinical research articles, evaluate the balance between the advantages and disadvantages of medical activities, and optimize medical activity-related patient outcomes with respect to several important points requiring decision-making in clinical practice.

### Expert perspectives on management of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis: A multidisciplinary consensus addressing current and emerging therapies [^114aHnb3]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2017). Low credibility.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common, chronic, relapsing, inflammatory skin disease that affects children and adults. Until recently, the only Food and Drug Administration-approved systemic treatment option for patients with moderate-to-severe AD was systemic steroids, which are not recommended by guidelines and are commonly associated with disease rebound. Instead, clinicians choose from several off-label immunosuppressants, which can have serious adverse effects. A significant number of these patients go untreated. Research on the immunopathogenesis of AD has paved the way for new, targeted, systemic therapies for moderate-to-severe AD.

In early 2017, the Food and Drug Administration approved dupilumab for adults with moderate-to-severe AD whose disease is not adequately controlled with topical therapies. Although the national guidelines can be very helpful to clinicians, the process for updating them does not allow for timely incorporation of novel therapies. A steering committee of AD experts, including dermatologists, allergists, and a patient advocacy group representative, developed recommendations based on a literature review and expert opinion to help clinicians understand how new therapies fit into the treatment paradigm and to provide practical recommendations for assessing AD severity, treatment response, and treatment failure.

### Qvar [^112i6FFa]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2010). Low credibility.

The transfer of patients from systemic steroid therapy to Qvar may unmask allergic conditions previously suppressed by the systemic steroid therapy, such as rhinitis, conjunctivitis, and eczema.

Persons who are on drugs that suppress the immune system are more susceptible to infections than healthy individuals. Chickenpox and measles, for instance, can have a more serious or even fatal course in non-immune children or adults on corticosteroids. In such children or adults who have not had these diseases or been properly immunized, particular care should be taken to avoid exposure. It is not known how the dose, route, and duration of corticosteroid administration affect the risk of developing a disseminated infection, nor is the contribution of the underlying disease and/or prior corticosteroid treatment known. If exposed to chickenpox, prophylaxis with varicella-zoster immune globulin (VZIG) may be indicated. If exposed to measles, prophylaxis with pooled intramuscular immunoglobulin (IG) may be indicated [refer to the respective package inserts for complete VZIG and IG prescribing information]. If chickenpox develops, treatment with antiviral agents may be considered.

Qvar is not a bronchodilator and is not indicated for the rapid relief of bronchospasm. As with other inhaled asthma medications, bronchospasm, with an immediate increase in wheezing, may occur after dosing. If bronchospasm occurs following dosing with Qvar, it should be treated immediately with a short-acting inhaled bronchodilator. Treatment with Qvar should be discontinued and alternative therapy should be considered.

### Safety and efficacy of topical calcineurin inhibitors in the treatment of childhood atopic dermatitis [^1179zu3p]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Approximately 10–20% of infants in industrialized countries experience atopic dermatitis. In recent decades, topical corticosteroids have been the first-choice therapy for the treatment of flares. However, this form of therapy may induce skin atrophy, especially after application to facial lesions or with long-term use. Thus, the development of new anti-inflammatory topical agents for the treatment of childhood atopic dermatitis was needed.

The topical calcineurin inhibitors, tacrolimus and pimecrolimus, have an effect on various cells of the cutaneous immune system, specifically on T cells, by inhibiting the phosphatase calcineurin and preventing the transcription of proinflammatory cytokines. In several clinical studies involving children and adults with atopic dermatitis, topical calcineurin inhibitors were found to be effective both on the face and the trunk and extremities, in both short- and long-term treatment regimens. Tachyphylaxis or rebound was not observed. In most patients, an improvement in their eczema occurred during the first week of treatment, as measured by subjective and objective clinical signs of atopic dermatitis.

Treatment significantly reduced the incidence of flares and the need for corticosteroids in children and adults. Treatment success, commonly defined as 'excellent improvement' or 'clearing of all lesions', was observed in more than one-third of all children treated with 0.03% or 0.1% tacrolimus or 1% pimecrolimus. The topical application of pimecrolimus and tacrolimus does not lead to significant blood concentrations of these agents in the majority of children.

### What's new in atopic eczema? An analysis of systematic reviews published in 2017. Part 1: Treatment and prevention [^1133bUzU]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

This review forms part of a series of annual updates that summarize the evidence base for atopic eczema (AE). It provides a summary of key findings from 25 systematic reviews that were published or indexed during 2017 and focuses on the treatment and prevention of AE. There is high-quality evidence to demonstrate that dupilumab is better than placebo for the treatment of AE, is not associated with a higher incidence of adverse effects, and does not increase the risk of infection compared with placebo; however, comparison studies with other systemic treatments are necessary. Topical tofacitinib is a promising treatment for mild to moderate AE but currently lacks sufficient evidence from well-designed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing it with other active treatments. Topical doxepin may be effective for pruritus in AE, but available studies have short follow-up periods and longer-term outcomes are needed. Bleach baths were no more effective than water baths alone at reducing AE severity. Topical antibiotics cannot be recommended for infected AE due to insufficient evidence of benefit. There is little comparison of different emollients in RCTs, but overall evidence indicates that they reduce AE severity, are steroid-sparing, and lead to better outcomes in combination with topical corticosteroids (TCS) than TCS alone. No clear benefit was demonstrated for vitamin D, C, or E supplementation in pregnancy for eczema prevention.

### Prednisolone vs. ciclosporin for severe adult eczema. An investigator-initiated double-blind placebo-controlled multicentre trial [^117JZ6LE]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Patients with severe eczema frequently receive systemic glucocorticosteroids. The efficacy of prednisolone and other steroids, however, has never been evaluated appropriately. A meta-analysis indicated that ciclosporin is the best evaluated systemic treatment for eczema.

- **Objectives**: To investigate the comparative efficacy of prednisolone and ciclosporin for severe eczema.

- **Methods**: In an investigator-initiated double-blind randomized multicentre trial, adults with severe eczema (objective SCORAD ≥ 40 and Dermatology Life Quality Index ≥ 10) were randomly allocated to receive prednisolone (initial dose 0.5–0.8 mg/kg daily) for 2 weeks followed by placebo for 4 weeks or ciclosporin (2.7–4.0 mg/kg daily) for 6 weeks and followed for another 12 weeks. Concomitant treatment included a moderately potent topical steroid, emollients, and continuation of antihistamines. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with stable remission, defined as ≥ 50% SCORAD improvement under active treatment and no flare (≥ 75% of baseline SCORAD) during follow-up. Sample size calculation indicated that 66 patients were needed to see clinically relevant differences between groups. Analysis was by intention-to-treat (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00445081).

- **Results**: Due to unexpectedly high numbers of withdrawals caused by significant exacerbations of eczema (n = 15/38), an independent data monitoring and safety board proposed early study termination. Thirty-eight patients were randomized and analysed. Stable remission was achieved in one of 21 patients.

### Consensus statement on the management of chronic hand eczema [^116EXTne]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

The management of chronic hand eczema is often inadequate. There are currently no evidence-based guidelines specifically for its management, and the evidence for established treatments is not of sufficient quality to guide clinical practice. This consensus statement, based on a review of published data and clinical practice in both primary and secondary care, is intended to guide the management of chronic hand eczema. It describes the epidemiology and pathogenesis of hand eczema, its diagnosis, and its effect on patients' quality of life.

- **Management strategies**
- **Skin education programme, lifestyle changes, and use of emollients, barriers, and soap substitutes**.
- **Topical drug therapy**: Includes topical steroids and calcineurin inhibitors.
- **Advanced treatments**: Psoralen ultraviolet A and systemic therapies may be appropriate, although there is no strong evidence of efficacy.

Alitretinoin has been shown to be effective in a randomized controlled trial and is currently the only treatment specifically licensed for the treatment of hand eczema. Recommendations for management are summarized in a treatment algorithm.

### Topical corticosteroids in dermatology [^1135NE3b]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Topical corticosteroids are the most commonly prescribed agents in the treatment of dermatologic conditions. They are used primarily as monotherapy or in combination with other agents for enhanced efficacy. Several stronger preparations are now available since their first introduction. They are also available in various vehicles, altering the potency and giving the option of tailoring them for use based on specific anatomic locations, area of involvement, age of the patient, and, most importantly, severity of the condition.

Several local and systemic side effects have been associated with their inadvertent use. Allergic contact dermatitis to most of the preparations has also been noticed. Judicious use with reinforced patient education lowers such risk for side effects and can be of great use in treating dermatologic conditions.

### Guidelines of care for the management of atopic dermatitis in adults with topical therapies [^116sXU2x]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2023). High credibility.

New evidence has emerged since the 2014 guidelines that further informs the management of atopic dermatitis (AD) with topical therapies. These guidelines update the 2014 recommendations for management of AD with topical therapies.

- **Objective**: To provide evidence-based recommendations related to management of AD in adults using topical treatments.

- **Methods**: A multidisciplinary workgroup conducted a systematic review and applied the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations) approach for assessing the certainty of evidence and formulating and grading recommendations.

- **Results**: The workgroup developed 12 recommendations on the management of AD in adults with topical therapies, including nonprescription agents and prescription topical corticosteroids (TCS), calcineurin inhibitors (TCIs), Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors (PDE-4), antimicrobials, and antihistamines.

- **Limitations**: The pragmatic decision to limit the literature review to English-language randomized trials may have excluded data published in other languages and relevant long-term follow-up data.

- **Conclusions**: Strong recommendations are made for the use of moisturizers, TCIs, TCS, and topical PDE-4 and JAK inhibitors. Conditional recommendations are made for the use of bathing and wet wrap therapy and against the use of topical antimicrobials, antiseptics, and antihistamines.

### Use of systemic corticosteroids for atopic dermatitis: International Eczema Council consensus statement [^115ahS9M]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

The divergence between guidelines discouraging systemic corticosteroids (CS) use and their frequent utilization in routine clinical practice is a concern. Ease of use, rapid response in distressing symptoms, cost, and the familiarity of primary care physicians with systemic CS for other conditions likely contribute to this discrepancy. The divergence between treatments advised in guidelines for hypothetical clinical scenarios and the decisions physicians make when dealing with individual patients in one-to-one consultations has been studied using a behavioral economics approach. Physicians often deviate from agreed best practices when confronted with a distressed patient. Systematic approaches to better understand the implementation gaps between guidelines and practice have been advanced in a recent white paper by the healthcare quality organization Joint Commission International and may be applicable to systemic CS use for atopic dermatitis (AD).

The major strength of our study is the involvement of a large, geographically diverse group of International Eczema Council (IEC) expert AD clinicians and researchers in the consensus process. During the panel discussion preceding the formal consensus survey, it was clear that clinical practice, even among experts, differed significantly from country to country. Given the sparsity of randomized controlled trial (RCT) and high-quality nonrandomized study evidence to support any one viewpoint, keeping an open mind to different practices is important. Despite the diversity of respondents, there was over-representation from some countries, including the United States, which may have biased the results, and we would have benefited from a more balanced representation.

### Use of systemic corticosteroids for atopic dermatitis: International Eczema Council consensus statement [^113AYwQb]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Among a large international group of clinicians and researchers with expertise in atopic dermatitis (AD), we reached consensus on 12 key statements related to the use of systemic corticosteroids (CS) for severe AD. The results provide a framework for clinicians caring for patients with severe AD who are considering systemic CS as a treatment option. Most notably, the group agreed on the statements that, for patients of any age, systemic CS should generally be avoided but may be used rarely, and strongly opposed the statements that systemic CS should be used regularly for severe AD.

While our group agreed that systemic CS use should be limited, consensus was reached on several clinical situations in which systemic CS may be appropriate. These included disease-related factors, such as severe acute flares, as well as patient-related factors, such as important life events. Additionally, 72% of participants agreed that systemic CS could be considered a bridging treatment to other systemic treatments. While ciclosporin acts rapidly for acute AD flares, it may be contraindicated in some patients. Methotrexate, azathioprine, and mycophenolate take several weeks to exert their clinical effects, and so in some circumstances, taking advantage of the rapid onset of action of systemic CS while waiting for a safer long-term alternative to work may be appropriate. There are also some circumstances in which other systemic treatment options are not acceptable; for example, a recent diagnosis of cancer along with a history of alcoholism would be a contraindication to the use of ciclosporin, azathioprine, and mycophenolate.

### Expert perspectives on key parameters that impact interpretation of randomized clinical trials in moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis [^116bApPt]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2022). Low credibility.

Placebo-controlled randomized trials are the gold standard for clinical research and are required for regulatory approval. Considerations around placebo utilization in AD clinical trials and practical suggestions for trial design were recently expertly reviewed. When attempting to compare active agents from independent placebo-controlled trials, attention must be paid to the response rate to placebo in each trial, which may be influenced by background treatments or rescue therapies.

To reflect real-world practice, many clinical trials for moderate-to-severe AD compare placebo and TCS with the experimental drug and TCS, as placebo alone may not meet standard-of-care and may expose participants to a risk of worsening AD and reduced quality of life. However, if background TCS is used on an as-needed basis, participants in the placebo arm may use more TCS than participants in the active treatment arm. This could result in higher levels of AD improvement in the placebo arm and lead to an underestimation of the perceived placebo-adjusted treatment effect of the experimental drug.

Placebo responses may also be influenced by the method by which participants obtain rescue treatment in a trial. Some trials supply TCS directly to participants, which minimizes barriers to use. In such trials, participants may use TCS more consistently and in greater amounts than they would in the real world where a prescription is typically required. Other trials do not supply TCS and require participants to obtain new TCS prescriptions. In some instances, there may be a financial barrier to accessing necessary treatments.

### Does order of application of emollient and topical corticosteroids make a difference in the severity of atopic eczema in children [^116irt5T]? Pediatric Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Atopic eczema (AE) is a common chronic inflammatory skin disorder in children, with emollients and topical corticosteroids (TCSs) commonly prescribed as treatment. There is no published guidance on the correct order of application of emollient and TCS in children with AE.

- **Objective**: The objective of this study was to determine whether the order of application of emollient and TCS makes a difference in the severity of AE in children.

- **Methods**: Forty-six patients aged 4 months to 5 years with moderate to severe AE were randomized to two groups: Group A applied emollient followed by TCS 15 minutes later twice daily, and Group B applied TCS followed by emollient 15 minutes later twice daily for 2 weeks.

- **Results**: There was no statistically significant difference in the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) score, percentage of body surface area (BSA) affected, or itch score between groups A and B (p > 0.05). Group A had statistically significant improvement in the EASI score, percentage BSA affected, and itch score from baseline to weeks 1 and 2; Group B demonstrated statistically significant improvement only in the EASI score from baseline to week 1 and in itch score from baseline to week 2. There was no difference in adverse events between the groups.

- **Conclusion**: This study suggests that the order of application of emollient and TCS does not matter in the treatment of AE in children and that parents can apply topical medications in whichever order they prefer.

### Practical guidelines for the use of steroid-sparing agents in the treatment of chronic pruritus [^113eiStZ]. Dermatologic Therapy (2013). Low credibility.

Chronic pruritus in the adult patient is both an underappreciated and difficult-to-treat condition. In the vast majority of cases, itch is the result of inflammatory skin disease and may respond to systemic anti-inflammatory therapies. Urticarial dermatitis is an under-recognized cause of chronic itch in the adult population. Patients with this disorder are often characterized by prolonged, prednisone-responsive pruritus, frequently occurring in the absence of substantial cutaneous findings.

Skin findings, when present, can range from subtle, persistent urticarial lesions to excoriated papules, often intermixed with urticaria, eczematous changes, and lichenification secondary to chronic scratching. Here, we describe our algorithm for the evaluation and management of adult patients with refractory pruritus (urticarial dermatitis in particular). This includes evaluation for other etiologies of pruritus, pre-immunosuppression workup, and the use of azathioprine and other steroid-sparing agents for the treatment of recalcitrant itch.

### Atopic dermatitis: A new treatment paradigm using pimecrolimus [^111oGPDK]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

Atopic dermatitis (AD), often called eczema, is a disease characterized by intense pruritus, erythema, dry skin, and inflammation. Pimecrolimus is a novel steroid-free treatment for AD. Consistently positive results have been found with pimecrolimus treatment in infants, children/adolescents, and adults. Its safety record is excellent, and studies have found no clinically relevant drug-related systemic adverse events.

- **Review of atopic dermatitis and conventional treatment strategies**: In this article, we first review atopic dermatitis and conventional treatment strategies.

- **Discussion of pimecrolimus**: We discuss various aspects of pimecrolimus, including pharmacologic properties, toxicology, short- and long-term studies, and safety and adverse events.

- **Proposed new treatment strategy**: Finally, we propose a new steroid-sparing treatment strategy for AD.

### Effective prescribing in steroid allergy: Controversies and cross-reactions [^112BuWKp]. Clinics in Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Contact allergy to topical corticosteroids should be considered in all patients who do not respond to or are exacerbated by the use of topical steroids. The incidence of steroid allergy in such patients is reported as 9% to 22% in adult patients and 25% in children. It can often go undiagnosed for an extended period in patients with a long history of dermatologic conditions and steroid use. Although rare, both immediate and delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions have been reported to systemic corticosteroids, with an incidence of 0.3%. Reported reactions range from localized eczematous eruptions to systemic reactions, anaphylaxis, and even death. Delayed-type reactions to systemically administered steroids may present as generalized dermatitis, an exanthematous eruption, or occasionally, with blistering or purpura. This contribution clarifies the issues surrounding the pathogenesis of steroid allergy, covers the importance of cross-reactions, and describes strategies for investigating and managing patients with suspected steroid allergy.

### Topical anti-inflammatory treatments for eczema: A Cochrane systematic review and network meta-analysis [^113CfdL9]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2024). High credibility.

Eczema is the most burdensome skin condition worldwide, and topical anti-inflammatory treatments are commonly used to control symptoms. However, the relative effectiveness and safety of different topical anti-inflammatory treatments remain uncertain.

A network meta-analysis was performed within a Cochrane systematic review to compare and statistically rank the efficacy and safety of topical anti-inflammatory eczema treatments. Data sources included the Cochrane Skin Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and trial registries, up to June 2023.

Included trials were either within-participant or between-participant randomized controlled trials. Participants had eczema that was not clinically infected and was not contact dermatitis, seborrheic eczema, or hand eczema. The interventions were topical anti-inflammatory treatments, excluding complementary treatments, antibiotics alone, wet wraps, phototherapy, or systemic treatments. Comparators included no treatment, vehicle, or another topical anti-inflammatory.

We identified 291 trials with a total of 45,846 participants, mainly from high-income countries. Most trials were industry-funded with a median treatment duration of three weeks. The risk of bias, assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 tool, was high in 89% of trials, primarily due to selective reporting risks. The network meta-analysis of binary outcomes ranked potent and/or very potent topical steroids, tacrolimus 0.1%, and ruxolitinib 1.5% among the most effective treatments for improving patient-reported symptoms and clinician-reported signs (40 trials, all low confidence).

### Dermatologists' knowledge of and preferences regarding topical steroids [^117EovbC]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Topical corticosteroids are the standard-of-care treatment for dermatitis, mild psoriasis, and other inflammatory skin diseases. Prescribing practices rely on knowledge of topical corticosteroid potency, as well as potential side effects, including steroid allergies.

- **Purpose**: The primary aim of this study is to determine how dermatologists classify particular topical corticosteroids according to potency, and which products they prefer when allergenicity is a concern.

- **Methods**: The data were collected and analyzed from 105 US-based dermatologists surveyed at the 2011 Summer American Academy of Dermatology meeting.

- **Results**: The majority of dermatologists were in agreement on the potency ranking of many commonly prescribed topical corticosteroids. Two-thirds of the surveyed dermatologists expressed concern about allergy to topical corticosteroids. In cases of a suspected allergy, desoximetasone was the leading product dermatologists would choose to prescribe.

- **Limitations**: The survey was limited to attendees of an educational conference, possibly leading to an overestimation of dermatologist knowledge of topical steroids.

- **Conclusions**: This study shows that dermatologists are generally knowledgeable about group classifications of corticosteroids in terms of potency and that they can appropriately select a topical product with low potential for allergy.

### Assessment of efficacy and safety outcomes beyond week 16 in clinical trials of systemic agents used for the treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in combination with topical corticosteroids [^112vnCQD]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2023). Low credibility.

When making cross-trial comparisons, the following elements of ECZTRA 3 are important to consider:

- **In the analyses beyond week 16**: No placebo comparator was included, and all patients received active therapy.

- **Response rates presented at week 32**: These are based on a post-hoc analysis conducted by pooling all patients treated with tralokinumab in the initial treatment period (n = 252), irrespective of responses at week 16 and tralokinumab dosing regimen thereafter.

- **A 2-week washout of TCS was required**: Prior to treatment initiation, rescue treatment (higher-potency TCS: Europe class > 3; US class < 4 or systemic drugs) was allowed from the start of the trial to control intolerable AD symptoms at the investigators' discretion.

- **Standardization of concomitant TCS use**: This trial was the only one to standardize concomitant TCS use in the protocol to mometasone furoate 0.1% cream (Europe class 3 [potent]; US class 4 [mid-strength]), and supply this medication to patients in kit sizes of 180–200 g Q2W. Patients returned all used and unused TCS tubes, which were then weighed to determine the amount of medication used. Patients were also allowed to use low-potency TCS or TCI in areas of the body where the use of the supplied TCS was inadvisable.

- **TCS use at week 16 and beyond**: At week 16, patients treated with tralokinumab used approximately 50% less TCS compared with patients treated with placebo; the mean use remained low (around 5–7 g/week) for patients continuing with tralokinumab treatment.

- **NRI implementation**: This was implemented for patients who used rescue medication or withdrew from the trial, as well as for missing data.

### Clinical practice guidelines for the management of atopic dermatitis 2016 [^114TNKe3]. The Journal of Dermatology (2016). High credibility.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a disease characterized by relapsing eczema with pruritus as a primary lesion. Most patients have an atopic predisposition. The definitive diagnosis of AD requires the presence of all three features: (i) pruritus; (ii) typical morphology and distribution of the eczema; and (iii) chronic and chronically relapsing course.

- **Strategies to treat AD in Japan**: The perspective of evidence-based medicine consists of three primary measures: (i) the use of topical corticosteroids and tacrolimus ointment as the main treatment for the inflammation; (ii) topical application of emollients to treat the cutaneous barrier dysfunction; and (iii) avoidance of apparent exacerbating factors, psychological counseling, and advice about daily life.

The guidelines present recommendations to review clinical research articles, evaluate the balance between the advantages and disadvantages of medical activities, and optimize medical activity-related patient outcomes with respect to several important points requiring decision-making in clinical practice.

### Not all topical corticosteroids are created equal! Optimizing therapeutic outcomes through better understanding of vehicle formulations, compound selection, and methods of application [^115GUQfy]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Since the first successful topical glucocorticosteroid, compound F, was applied to human skin to treat eczematous dermatitis approximately 60 years ago, several advances have been made in the development of topical corticosteroid (TC) compounds and vehicle formulations. The ability to apply a TC and improve skin disease revolutionized dermatologic therapy and has proven to be one of the biggest advances in the history of dermatology. The potency of a TC and its vehicle formulation can vary among brand and generic TC compounds, which can sometimes confound the clinical situation, as one brand or generic formulation of a TC may be well tolerated while another generic formulation induces skin irritation or allergenicity in a patient who previously encountered no difficulties.

### Short-term systemic corticosteroids: Appropriate use in primary care [^1154T5Jf]. American Family Physician (2020). Low credibility.

Short-term systemic corticosteroids, commonly referred to as steroids, are frequently prescribed to adults in outpatient settings by primary care physicians. However, there is a lack of supporting evidence for most diagnoses for which steroids are prescribed. Specifically, there is evidence against the use of steroids in patients with acute bronchitis, acute sinusitis, carpal tunnel syndrome, and allergic rhinitis. Furthermore, the evidence is insufficient to support the routine use of steroids for conditions such as acute pharyngitis, lumbar radiculopathy, carpal tunnel syndrome, and herpes zoster. Conversely, there is evidence supporting the use of short-term steroids for treating Bell's palsy and acute gout.

Physicians might assume that short-term steroids are harmless and devoid of the widely known long-term effects associated with steroid use. However, even short courses of systemic corticosteroids are linked to numerous potential adverse effects, including hyperglycemia, elevated blood pressure, mood and sleep disturbances, sepsis, fractures, and venous thromboembolism. This review examines the evidence for the use of short-term steroids for common conditions encountered by primary care physicians.

### Choosing topical corticosteroids [^117ViBdX]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Topical corticosteroids are among the oldest and most useful treatments for dermatologic conditions. Many topical steroids are available, differing in potency and formulation. Successful treatment depends on an accurate diagnosis and consideration of the steroid's delivery vehicle, potency, frequency of application, duration of treatment, and potential side effects. Although the use of topical steroids is common, evidence of effectiveness exists only for select conditions such as psoriasis, vitiligo, eczema, atopic dermatitis, phimosis, acute radiation dermatitis, and lichen sclerosus. Evidence is limited for use in melasma, chronic idiopathic urticaria, and alopecia areata.

### Do people with eczema and their carers understand topical steroid potency? Results of two surveys [^111izKw9]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2024). Low credibility.

Topical corticosteroids (TCSs) are classified into four potencies: mild, moderate, potent, and very potent. Confusion arises from the wide range of products available, none of which have the potency level printed on the tubes or packaging. An online survey of patients and carers of people with eczema showed that only 17% of 984 respondents knew how many potencies there are. In a second survey, 315 respondents provided 1520 assignments of the potency of commonly used TCSs: 55.5% were correct, 21% were underestimates, and 23.5% were overestimates. Some errors were extreme: 12 (8%) of those using a very potent TCS considered it mild, while 9 (27%) using a mild TCS considered it potent or very potent.

Other themes expressed in free-text comments included inadequate and conflicting advice about using TCSs and lack of warnings about long-term adverse effects, particularly topical steroid withdrawal. Ninety-five percent of respondents wanted TCSs to be clearly labelled with potency.

### Assessment of efficacy and safety outcomes beyond week 16 in clinical trials of systemic agents used for the treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in combination with topical corticosteroids [^116pJzSR]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2023). High credibility.

Clinicians interpreting trial results should be aware of several key parameters of clinical trial designs that may influence outcomes. Some of the key parameters identified in the recent review by Silverberg et al. were the comparator (e.g. placebo, active control, head-to-head), the definition of and rules for rescue treatment (e.g. timing for when rescue is permitted), lengths of washout periods for topical and systemic treatments (e.g. 72 hours; 1, 2, or 4 weeks), and inclusion/exclusion criteria (e.g. age, disease severity).

Inconsistent inclusion and exclusion criteria between trials can complicate comparative data interpretation. In our experience, patients with moderate atopic dermatitis (AD) at baseline may be more responsive to treatment and, thus, show increased improvement, whereas those with severe AD may have more refractory disease that is less responsive to treatment. Exclusion criteria can also affect safety outcomes because some trials exclude patients with more complicated medical histories who may be at risk of experiencing adverse events (AEs).

The washout period refers to the time before baseline when a patient does not use medication to ensure that effects of previous treatment are no longer present before initiating the investigational drug. A shorter washout period could affect early trial results due to an unintended enduring effect of the previous treatment. Longer washouts could allow AD to flare up, necessitating the use of rescue treatment early in the trial.

### European S2k guideline on chronic pruritus [^116bj4ra]. Acta Dermato-Venereologica (2019). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for pruritus, more specifically with respect to systemic therapy, EADV/EDF 2019 guidelines recommend considering offering systemic corticosteroids as a short-term treatment in selected patients with refractory chronic pruritus, especially in cases of paraneoplastic pruritus and palliative care.

### Guidelines of care for the management of atopic dermatitis in adults with topical therapies [^116gbFE5]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2023). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for atopic dermatitis, specifically concerning topical corticosteroids, the AAD 2023 guidelines recommend offering intermittent (twice weekly) medium-potent topical corticosteroids as maintenance therapy. This approach aims to reduce disease flares and relapse in adult patients with atopic dermatitis.

### Use of systemic corticosteroids for atopic dermatitis: International Eczema Council consensus statement [^1135RnSF]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Guidelines discourage the use of systemic corticosteroids for atopic dermatitis, yet their usage remains widespread. An international group of experts sought to reach a consensus on this subject. A survey consisting of statements with visual analogue scales, ranging from 'strongly disagree' to 'strongly agree', was distributed to the International Eczema Council. Consensus was achieved if less than 30% of respondents indicated 'strongly disagree'.
Sixty out of seventy-seven members (78%) participated, reaching consensus on twelve statements. Among these was the agreement that systemic corticosteroids should generally be avoided, except in rare severe cases under certain circumstances. These include a lack of other treatment options, serving as a bridge to other systemic therapies or phototherapy, addressing acute flares needing immediate relief, anticipating major life events, or dealing with the most severe cases. If used, the treatment should be short term. Although there was agreement that systemic corticosteroids should never be used in children, consensus on this statement was not reached. The conclusions are limited by a lack of high‐quality published evidence. Under more stringent criteria (e.g. requiring less than 20% toward 'strongly disagree'), fewer statements would have reached consensus.

In summary, based on expert opinions, the routine use of systemic corticosteroids for atopic dermatitis is generally discouraged.

### Use of systemic corticosteroids for atopic dermatitis: International Eczema Council consensus statement [^113yRupp]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

In conclusion, it is the consensus of the IEC that systemic CS have a limited role in the treatment of severe AD in children and adults. Clinicians should limit their use to special circumstances and always consider other treatment options. If they are prescribed, they should be limited to short-term use with a long-term treatment plan not involving systemic CS. We hope that this serves to curb the overprescription of these medications for patients with AD.

### Rapid, successful treatment of atopic dermatitis recalcitrant to topical corticosteroids [^113finou]. Pediatric Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Atopic dermatitis is typically responsive to midpotency topical corticosteroids, which are the mainstay of treatment. However, many patients exhibit disease that is "resistant" to triamcinolone, which is commonly prescribed for outpatient use. Such resistance is often attributed to poor adherence, yet patients and caregivers may insist that the steroid was ineffective and assure the physician that it was applied as recommended.

We describe the case of a young girl with a two-year history of atopic dermatitis resistant to triamcinolone, whose condition rapidly improved with continued use of triamcinolone. This case raises the ethical dilemma of whether physicians should base treatment plans on patient reports or on evidence regarding adherence.

### Use of systemic corticosteroids for atopic dermatitis: International Eczema Council consensus statement [^117CMeH9]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Guidelines discourage the use of systemic corticosteroids for atopic dermatitis (AD), but their use remains widespread.

- **Objectives**: To reach consensus among an international group of AD experts on the use of systemic corticosteroids for AD.

- **Methods**: A survey consisting of statements accompanied by visual analogue scales ranging from 'strongly disagree' to 'neutral' to 'strongly agree' was distributed to the International Eczema Council (IEC). Consensus was reached on a statement if less than 30% of respondents marked to the left of 'neutral' towards 'strongly disagree'.
- **Results**: Sixty of 77 (78%) IEC members participated. Consensus was reached on 12 statements, including that systemic corticosteroids should generally be avoided but can be used rarely for severe AD under certain circumstances. These circumstances include a lack of other treatment options, as a bridge to other systemic therapies or phototherapy, during acute flares in need of immediate relief, in anticipation of a major life event, or in the most severe cases. If used, treatment should be limited to the short term. Most respondents agreed that systemic corticosteroids should never be used in children, but consensus was not reached on that statement. The conclusions of our expert group are limited by a dearth of high-quality published evidence. If more stringent consensus criteria were applied, such as requiring less than 20% of respondents marking towards 'strongly disagree', consensus would have been reached on fewer statements.

- **Conclusions**: Based on expert opinion from the IEC, the routine use of systemic corticosteroids for AD is discouraged.

### Atopic dermatitis (eczema) guidelines: 2023 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology/American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology Joint Task Force on Practice Parameters GRADE- and Institute of Medicine-based recommendations [^114nHgU2]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for atopic dermatitis, more specifically with respect to topical corticosteroids, the AAAAI/ACAAI 2024 guidelines recommend considering offering a time and body area-limited trial (for 4–7 days, minimum 1 hour to maximum overnight, once daily) of occlusive low-to-mid-potency topical corticosteroid (US classes 3–7) therapy. This is suggested in addition to standard topical therapy for patients with localized uncontrolled atopic dermatitis refractory to mid-to-high-potency topical treatment (US classes 2–5 or tacrolimus).

### Topical anti-inflammatory treatments for eczema: Network meta-analysis [^115VUbDH]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). High credibility.

The intervention is topical anti-inflammatory treatments. The following interventions were included:

- **Topical corticosteroids (TCS)**: This includes combinations with antimicrobials (with the caveat that studies limited to clinically infected eczema will not be included) or salicylic acid. TCS were grouped by potency: mild, moderate, potent, and very potent.
- **Topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCI)**: Examples include tacrolimus and pimecrolimus.
- **Topical phosphodiesterase IV (PDE-4) inhibitors**: Such as crisaborole.
- **Topical Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors**: Examples include ruxolitinib or delgocitinib.
- **Topical aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) activators**: Such as tapinarof.
- **Other well-characterised novel anti-inflammatory treatments**.

In general, eligible interventions are listed in the British National Formulary (BNF) as suitable products for treating eczema; however, products not included in the BNF were considered if they were clinically relevant. To ensure the review was focused and relevant, trials of historical topical therapies no longer used worldwide for treating eczema (such as coal tar) were not included, except for trials of discontinued TCS for which the potency of the TCS preparation can be inferred.

### Topical therapy of atopic dermatitis: Controversies from Hippocrates to topical immunomodulators [^1112cTie]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Although atopic dermatitis can be treated efficiently, there is still much controversy about the risk/benefit ratio of both topical corticosteroids and topical immunomodulators. Conflicting data may be found about the usefulness of bathing, diet regulation, and other therapeutic interventions. These controversies result in part from the persistence of Hippocratic doctrines in modern medical thinking. Humoralist and diathetic doctrines, as they pertain to eczema, are reviewed. The paradoxical worsening of oozing and the deadly hazards of hospitalization before the era of antibiotics are brought to mind. We hope that this historical review will improve the understanding of controversies and help dermatologists to manage patients with atopic dermatitis and other chronic skin diseases.

### Use of systemic corticosteroids for atopic dermatitis: International Eczema Council consensus statement [^1156F5bs]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

We were unable to reach a consensus on many issues related to dosing and duration of systemic corticosteroid (CS) use. However, a clear majority of participants (94%) agreed that the use of systemic CS should be limited to short periods, in keeping with clinical practice guidelines. Our group did not reach consensus on a definition of short-term use. The European Task Force on Atopic Dermatitis/European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology task force position statement on the treatment of atopic dermatitis (AD) suggests that a typical regimen of systemic CS might be methylprednisolone 0.5 mg/kg daily for 1–2 weeks, tapered over 1 month, but there is no randomized controlled trial (RCT) evidence for the safety or efficacy of this specific regimen.

Most respondents (but not enough for consensus) agreed that systemic CS should never be used in children. While the circumstances agreed upon for the use of systemic CS in AD can be applied to patients of all ages, they are less applicable for young children. Most children will have fewer comorbidities complicating the use of immunomodulatory agents such as ciclosporin. As such, while systemic CS should be used rarely for severe AD in general, their use should be even more limited in children, particularly given concerns regarding infection, growth delay, and increased rates of obesity.

### Topical anti-inflammatory treatments for eczema: Network meta-analysis [^116a2u2o]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). High credibility.

Eczema (atopic dermatitis) is the most burdensome skin condition worldwide and cannot currently be prevented or cured. Topical anti-inflammatory treatments are used to control eczema symptoms, but there is uncertainty about the relative effectiveness and safety of different topical anti-inflammatory treatments.

- **Objectives**: To compare and rank the efficacy and safety of topical anti-inflammatory treatments for people with eczema using a network meta-analysis.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Skin Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and trial registries on 29 June 2023, and checked the reference lists of included studies.

- **Selection criteria**: We included within-participant or between-participant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in people of any age with eczema of any severity, but excluded trials in clinically infected eczema, seborrhoeic eczema, contact eczema, or hand eczema. We included topical anti-inflammatory treatments used for at least one week, compared with another anti-inflammatory treatment, no treatment, or vehicle/placebo. A vehicle is a 'carrier system' for an active pharmaceutical substance, which may also be used on its own as an emollient for dry skin. We excluded trials of topical antibiotics used alone, complementary therapies, emollients used alone, phototherapy, wet wraps, and systemic treatments.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We used standard Cochrane methods. Primary outcomes were patient-reported eczema symptoms, clinician-reported eczema signs, and investigator global assessment. Secondary outcomes were health-related…

### 2020 European guideline on the management of genital molluscum contagiosum [^115UV9uF]. Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (2021). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of molluscum contagiosum, specifically with respect to eczema management, the EADV 2021 guidelines recommend offering emollients and, if necessary, a topical corticosteroid for the treatment of associated eczema. This is particularly advised when the eczema is itchy to reduce the risk of molluscum auto-inoculation through scratching.

### Leukotriene receptor antagonists for eczema [^114HBu2e]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). High credibility.

Eczema is a common, chronic, inflammatory skin condition that is frequently associated with atopic conditions, including asthma. Leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs) have a corticosteroid-sparing role in asthma, but their role in eczema remains controversial. Currently available topical therapies for eczema are often poorly tolerated, and the use of systemic agents is restricted by their adverse effect profile. Therefore, a review of alternative treatments was warranted.

- **Objectives**: To assess the possible benefits and harms of leukotriene receptor antagonists for eczema.

- **Search methods**: We searched the following databases to September 2017: the Cochrane Skin Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and the GREAT database. We also searched five trial registries and handsearched the bibliographies of all extracted studies for further relevant trials.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials of LTRAs alone or in combination with other (topical or systemic) treatments, compared with other treatments alone such as topical corticosteroids or placebo for eczema in the acute or chronic (maintenance) phase of eczema in adults and children.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. The primary outcome measures were change in disease severity, long-term symptom control, and adverse effects of treatment. Secondary outcomes included change in corticosteroid requirement, reduction of pruritus, quality of life, and emollient requirement. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence for each outcome.

### Chronic urticarial plaques in a young woman [^115vj7rd]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

- **Question 3**: Which of the following is the best treatment for this condition?
A. Prednisone
B. Mepolizumab
C. Omalizumab
D. Canakinumab
E. Dupilumab

- **Answers**:

- **A. Prednisone**: Incorrect. While prednisone may provide symptomatic relief, it is not ideal for long-term management of FCAS due to its significant side-effect profile.

- **B. Mepolizumab**: Incorrect. Mepolizumab is a fully humanized anti-interleukin 5 monoclonal antibody used to treat severe asthma with eosinophilia, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, and hypereosinophilic syndrome. It has neither shown benefit in FCAS nor in CIU.

- **C. Omalizumab**: Incorrect. Omalizumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds the Fc receptor of immunoglobulin E. It is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for asthma and CIU but not for FCAS.

- **D. Canakinumab**: Correct. Canakinumab is a fully human anti-interleukin 1β monoclonal antibody, administered subcutaneously every 8 weeks. It is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of FCAS as well as other periodic fever syndromes, hyperimmunoglobulin D syndrome, systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis, and adult-onset Still disease. Our patient was treated with canakinumab 150 mg administered every 8 weeks and experienced full resolution of symptoms after her first dose.

- **E. Dupilumab**: Incorrect. Dupilumab is a monoclonal antibody to the interleukin 4 receptor α subunit, which binds interleukin 4 and interleukin 13. It is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for atopic dermatitis, asthma, and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps.
