## Question

Causes of isolated elevated alkaline phosphatase

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the causes of isolated elevated alkaline phosphatase and how to evaluate it. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the abnormality and excluding spurious causes. Then, I should verify the source of ALP using GGT and consider isoenzyme fractionation. Next, I will categorize causes by hepatic versus non-hepatic origins, including bone, intestinal, placental, and tumor-derived sources. After that, I should outline a practical, stepwise diagnostic algorithm and highlight special populations and red flags. Finally, I will synthesize the most common etiologies and note what would change my approach if new data emerge.

> Let me first confirm the abnormality and exclude pre-analytical or transient causes, because I need to ensure we are not reacting to a false positive or a transient spike. I should repeat the liver panel, review medications and supplements including over-the-counter and herbal products, and consider recent intercurrent illness, as transient benign hyperphosphatasemia can occur in infants and, less commonly, adults, and mild ALP elevations are common in the general population, so I should not jump to conclusions before verifying persistence and context [^a080bacb] [^b0f49774] [^a9acd0be] [^6ff95011].

> Next, I should review the source of ALP using GGT, and I need to check whether the elevation is hepatobiliary or non-hepatic. GGT is abundant in liver but not in bone, so a concomitant GGT elevation supports a hepatobiliary source, whereas a normal GGT points toward bone or other non-hepatic sources. If uncertainty remains, ALP isoenzyme electrophoresis can separate liver, bone, intestinal, and placental fractions, which can prevent unnecessary imaging or invasive testing [^c1d63df8] [^b59e34c7] [^584fd32f] [^ff84e3bc].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about hepatic causes just because GGT is elevated. I should categorize hepatobiliary etiologies into obstructive or cholestatic, infiltrative, vascular, and drug-induced injury, and I will examine each with the appropriate tests. Obstructive or cholestatic causes include choledocholithiasis, malignant biliary obstruction, primary biliary cholangitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, and intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy. Infiltrative diseases include sarcoidosis, granulomatous hepatitis, tuberculosis, amyloid, lymphoma, and metastatic cancer. Vascular causes include hepatic congestion from right-sided heart failure and ischemic cholangiopathy. And drug-induced cholestasis spans antibiotics, antifungals, antiepileptics, and many others, so I should double-check the medication timeline and use DILI causality frameworks when appropriate [^c1d63df8] [^27744646] [^9c63c613] [^6ff95011].

> Wait, let me verify the autoimmune cholestatic workup when ALP and GGT are elevated. I should order AMA with IgM for primary biliary cholangitis, and consider ANA and SMA if autoimmune overlap is suspected. In suspected PSC, I should confirm with MRCP rather than relying on ALP alone, and I should remember that AMA positivity alone without cholestatic enzymes is insufficient to diagnose PBC, warranting surveillance rather than treatment in most cases [^b67e099e] [^097ab41f] [^11429141] [^4eeb3aec] [^dffa1162].

> I will now examine non-hepatic sources, starting with bone disease, because a normal GGT often redirects me there. Vitamin D deficiency, osteomalacia, Paget's disease, hyperparathyroidism, and bone metastases can all raise ALP via osteoblastic activity. In children and adolescents, rapid growth elevates bone ALP, and in older adults, Paget's disease is a classic cause. I should confirm with 25-hydroxyvitamin D, calcium, phosphate, and PTH when bone disease is suspected, and use bone scan or targeted imaging if Paget's or metastases are on the table [^584fd32f] [^ba09017f] [^3cd48a7b] [^74cfc567].

> But wait, what if the ALP is intestinal in origin. I should consider transient benign hyperphosphatasemia of infancy, which can show marked ALP elevations that resolve spontaneously, and I should remember that intestinal ALP can be elevated after fatty meals or in certain gastrointestinal conditions. In adults, isolated intestinal ALP elevation without liver or bone disease has been reported as a benign biochemical variant, so I need to ensure I do not over-investigate when the clinical context is reassuring [^b0f49774] [^ff84e3bc].

> I need to check for pregnancy-related sources as well. In the third trimester, placental ALP rises and can be markedly elevated, and although this is usually expected, I should confirm there is no concurrent hepatobiliary disease if symptoms or other labs suggest it. Rarely, very high ALP in pregnancy has been linked to placental insufficiency and adverse fetal outcomes, so I should correlate with obstetric evaluation when the elevation is extreme or discordant [^584fd32f] [^e618422a].

> Let me consider tumor-derived ALP, especially in metastatic disease. Prostate cancer with osteoblastic bone metastases often shows elevated ALP from bone formation, and tumor cells themselves can express ALP isoforms. Similarly, pancreatic cancer and other solid tumors may elevate ALP via bone involvement or direct tumor expression, so in the right oncologic context I should integrate ALP with bone scan, cross-sectional imaging, and tumor markers as indicated [^2b031a6e] [^dd4d47cc] [^989614c7].

> Next, I should review a practical diagnostic algorithm and make sure I am not missing steps. First, confirm persistence and exclude spurious causes. Second, obtain GGT to localize the source. Third, if GGT is elevated, obtain right upper quadrant ultrasound to assess ducts and parenchyma. Fourth, if ultrasound is unrevealing and cholestasis persists, pursue autoimmune serologies and consider MRCP or ERCP for suspected PSC or obstruction. Fifth, if GGT is normal, evaluate for bone disease with calcium, phosphate, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, and PTH, and consider isoenzyme analysis if the source remains unclear. Finally, if all noninvasive tests are unrevealing and cholestasis persists beyond 6 months, consider liver biopsy to evaluate for small duct disease or infiltrative processes [^927019e1] [^c1d63df8] [^a080bacb].

> Hold on, I should verify special populations and red flags that modify urgency. In infants and toddlers, transient benign hyperphosphatasemia is common and often follows viral illness, so observation is reasonable if the child is well and other labs are normal. In pregnancy, I should confirm gestational timing and consider obstetric co-evaluation if ALP is extremely high. In older adults, Paget's disease and malignancy move up the differential. And in patients with severe COVID-19 or critical illness, ALP elevations may reflect systemic inflammation or ischemic hepatopathy, so I should interpret in the clinical context and avoid overtesting when the course is self-limited [^b0f49774] [^e618422a] [^3cd48a7b] [^1f310e05] [^c9eba59d].

> Let me synthesize the most common causes to anchor pretest probabilities. In adults with isolated ALP elevation and elevated GGT, intrahepatic cholestasis such as PBC, PSC, NAFLD with cholestatic features, and drug-induced cholestasis are frequent. With normal GGT, vitamin D deficiency, Paget's disease, bone metastases, and transient benign hyperphosphatasemia predominate. In children, physiologic bone turnover and transient benign hyperphosphatasemia are leading causes, whereas in pregnancy, placental ALP is expected. Across ages, medications and infiltrative diseases remain important considerations and should be actively excluded [^584fd32f] [^c1d63df8] [^b0f49774] [^9c63c613].

> I should double-check what would change my approach if new data emerge. If repeat testing shows resolution, I can avoid further workup. If new symptoms, jaundice, or synthetic dysfunction appear, I should escalate to cholangiography or biopsy. And if the clinical picture evolves toward an oncologic or granulomatous process, I should broaden imaging and serologies accordingly, always revisiting the medication history at each step to avoid anchoring bias [^a080bacb] [^927019e1] [^9c63c613].

Isolated elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP) most often reflects **bone disease** (Paget's, osteomalacia, metastases, hyperparathyroidism) [^584fd32f] or **cholestatic liver disease** (PBC, PSC, biliary obstruction) [^c1d63df8] [^4eeb3aec]. Less common causes include **intestinal ALP** (after fatty meals, blood types O/B) [^ff84e3bc], **placental ALP** (third trimester) [^e618422a], and **medications** (anticonvulsants, antibiotics, NSAIDs) [^9c63c613]. Confirm hepatic origin with GGT [^b59e34c7]; if normal, evaluate for bone disease with calcium, phosphate, 25(OH)D, PTH, and bone imaging [^ae5b80c6]. Persistent unexplained ALP > 1.5× ULN warrants targeted imaging and, if unresolved, liver biopsy [^927019e1].

---

## Physiological and benign causes

Physiological or benign causes of isolated ALP elevation include:

- **Growth and pregnancy**: Children and adolescents have higher ALP due to bone turnover; pregnancy raises ALP from placental production [^584fd32f] [^e618422a].

- **Intestinal ALP**: Elevated after fatty meals, in blood types O/B, or with recent eating [^notfound].

- **Transient benign hyperphosphatasemia**: Marked ALP rise in healthy infants/toddlers, often after viral illness, resolving spontaneously [^b0f49774].

---

## Hepatobiliary causes

When ALP is of hepatic origin (confirmed by elevated GGT), consider:

| **Category** | **Specific conditions** |
|-|-|
| Cholestatic liver diseases | - Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) [^b67e099e] <br/> - Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) [^4eeb3aec] <br/> - Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy [^notfound] |
| Biliary obstruction | - Choledocholithiasis <br/> - Benign/malignant strictures <br/> - Pancreatobiliary tumors [^bd82a380] |
| Infiltrative diseases | - Sarcoidosis [^3c389396] <br/> - Granulomatous hepatitis <br/> - Tuberculosis <br/> - Amyloidosis <br/> - Lymphoma <br/> - Metastatic cancer [^27744646] |
| Vascular causes | - Hepatic congestion from right-sided heart failure [^584fd32f] <br/> - Ischemic cholangiopathy [^27744646] |
| Medications | - Anticonvulsants <br/> - Antibiotics <br/> - NSAIDs <br/> - Anabolic steroids [^notfound] |

---

## Bone-related causes

When ALP is of bone origin (normal GGT), consider:

- **Paget's disease**: Characteristic ALP rise from increased bone turnover [^3cd48a7b].

- **Metabolic bone disease**: Osteomalacia, rickets, hyperparathyroidism, and renal osteodystrophy [^ba09017f].

- **Bone metastases**: Prostate, breast, lung, and other primaries [^notfound].

- **Fractures and healing**: Recent fractures elevate bone ALP [^584fd32f].

---

## Diagnostic approach

A **structured approach** is essential:

- **Confirm persistence**: Repeat ALP to verify ongoing elevation [^a080bacb].

- **Determine origin**: Measure GGT; elevation supports hepatobiliary source [^b59e34c7].

- **Hepatic evaluation**: If GGT is elevated, obtain RUQ ultrasound; if unrevealing, consider MRCP/ERCP, autoimmune serologies (AMA, ANA, ASMA), and liver biopsy if unresolved [^927019e1].

- **Bone evaluation**: If GGT is normal, check calcium, phosphate, 25(OH)D, PTH, and bone imaging (X-ray, bone scan) as indicated [^notfound].

- **Special populations**: In children, consider transient benign hyperphosphatasemia; in pregnancy, expect placental ALP in the third trimester [^b0f49774] [^e618422a].

---

## Clinical significance and prognosis

Persistent isolated ALP elevation can signal **significant disease** (e.g. PBC, PSC, malignancy) and warrants evaluation [^097ab41f] [^4eeb3aec]. In PSC, ALP normalization is associated with better outcomes [^124a0da6]. In pregnancy, marked ALP may reflect placental insufficiency or IUGR and merits obstetric assessment [^e618422a].

---

Isolated ALP elevation most often reflects **bone disease** or **cholestatic liver disease**, with other sources (intestinal, placental, drug-induced) less common. Confirm the source with GGT, then tailor evaluation to bone or liver pathways, escalating to imaging or biopsy if unresolved.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^c1d63df8]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Cholestatic liver diseases — evaluation of elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and the role of gamma‑glutamyl transferase (GGT) is outlined as follows: cholestatic liver diseases are associated with elevated alkaline phosphatase, with or without elevated bilirubin, and once alkaline phosphatase has been confirmed to be of hepatic origin, an ultrasound of the liver should be performed to assess the hepatic parenchyma and bile ducts. Biliary dilatation suggests an extrahepatic cause, whereas a non-dilated biliary system suggests that the cause of elevated alkaline phosphatase is intrahepatic; some disease of extrahepatic cholestasis may not be apparent by ultrasound and cholangiography by MR/MRCP or endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography should be undertaken when these disorders are suspected. With isolated alkaline phosphatase elevation, confirmation with GGT, or fractionation of alkaline phosphatase isoenzymes can be used to help differentiate alkaline phosphatase from non-liver sources; however, GGT elevation is not specific for cholestatic liver disease and can be elevated in > 50% of alcoholic patients without obvious evidence of liver disease, so GGT should not be used as a screening test for underlying liver disease in the absence of abnormal liver chemistries. In hospitalized patients with isolated alkaline phosphatase elevations, one study reported that ~80% could be given a clinical diagnosis solely based on history and physical examination, routine labs, and chest X-ray.

### Flecainide (flecainide acetate) [^91e36bbb]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

There have been rare reports of isolated elevations of serum alkaline phosphatase and isolated elevations of serum transaminase levels. These elevations have been asymptomatic and no cause and effect relationship with flecainide has been established. In foreign postmarketing surveillance studies, there have been rare reports of hepatic dysfunction including reports of cholestasis and hepatic failure, and extremely rare reports of blood dyscrasias. Although no cause and effect relationship has been established, it is advisable to discontinue flecainide in patients who develop unexplained jaundice or signs of hepatic dysfunction or blood dyscrasias in order to eliminate flecainide as the possible causative agent.

Incidence figures for other adverse effects in patients with ventricular arrhythmias are based on a multicenter efficacy study, utilizing starting doses of 200 mg/day with gradual upward titration to 400 mg/day. Patients were treated for an average of 4.7 months, with some receiving up to 22 months of therapy. In this trial, 5.4% of patients discontinued due to non-cardiac adverse effects.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^584fd32f]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is produced mainly in the liver (from the biliary epithelium) but is also found in abundance in bone and in smaller quantities in the intestines, kidneys and white blood cells. Levels are physiologically higher in childhood, associated with bone growth, and in pregnancy due to placental production. Pathologically increased levels occur mainly in bone disease (eg, metastatic bone disease and bone fractures) and cholestatic liver disease — for example, primary biliary cholangitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, common bile duct obstruction, intrahepatic duct obstruction (metastases) and drug-induced cholestasis. Furthermore, hepatic congestion secondary to right-sided heart failure can also lead to cholestasis (elevated ALP levels and/or bilirubin).

When ALP is elevated in isolation, the measurement of γ-glutamyltransferase can indicate whether the ALP is of hepatic or non-hepatic origin. While there are no data on the most likely causes of an isolated raised ALP in an asymptomatic population, the the most common cause is likely to be vitamin D deficiency, or normal increase seen in childhood due to rapid growth. Other causes include Paget's disease and bony metastases. If doubt still exists, the use of electrophoresis to separate the isoenzymes of ALP can differentiate hepatic from non-hepatic causes of increased ALP.

AST and ALT are enzymes present in hepatocytes and are released into the blood stream in response to hepatocyte injury or death (hepatitis). Elevations in either of these enzymes are the the most common abnormality seen on liver blood test profiles. Both enzymes are present in many differing types of tissue, but ALT is considered more liver-specific since it is present in low concentrations in non-hepatic tissue, and non-liver related elevations are uncommon. However, AST is abundantly present in skeletal, cardiac and smooth muscle and so may be elevated in patients with myocardial infarction or myositis. Although ALT is considered a more specific indicator of liver disease, the concentration of AST may be a more sensitive indicator of liver injury in conditions such as alcohol-related liver disease and in some cases of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH). In children, creatine kinase measurement may help to determine whether an isolated rise in ALT or AST is due to an underlying skeletal muscle disorder, such as muscular dystrophy.

### Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease presenting with an isolated elevated alkaline phosphatase [^1a5a2edb]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

Goals

To define a subset of patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) with isolated elevations in alkaline phophatase.

Background

NAFLD is a common referral to Gastroenterologists and Hepatologists. We have noted a subset of patients with biopsy proven NAFLD who present with an isolated elevation in alkaline phosphatase instead of the more typical aminotransferase elevations.

Study

A review of the liver biopsy database at Brooke Army Medical Center was performed with the key identifiers of "steatosis" and "steatohepatitis". Patients were separated into 2 groups depending on whether they presented with isolated elevated alkaline phosphatase (group 1), or more typical aminotransferase elevations (group 2). Multiple variables were analyzed to determine any significant differences between these groups.

Results

A total of 297 liver biopsies were evaluated. Of these, 135 biopsies were included in the study. Group 1 consisted of 14 patients and group 2 had 121 patients. Patients in group 1 were more likely to be older females (P < 0.05). Within group 1, those with steatohepatitis were older than those with steatosis (P < 0.05). When analyzed with regard to histopathology, patients with steatosis in group 1 were more likely female than group 2 patients (P = 0.03). Those with steatohepatitis in group 1 were older than group 2 patients (P = 0.001). Five of the 7 patients with steatohepatitis in group 1 had advanced liver disease at the time of biopsy.

Conclusions

Older female patients with isolated elevated alkaline phosphatase and risk factors for NAFLD should be evaluated for evidence of significant steatohepatitis.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^3b965a14]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Clinical pattern recognition for liver blood tests

There are three common patterns of abnormal liver test results whose recognition can aid diagnosis:
Isolated raised bilirubin — most commonly caused by Gilbert's syndrome (affects 5–8% of the population). Consider haemolysis in patients with anaemia. Repeat liver blood tests on a fasting sample with a full blood count and a direct and indirect bilirubin; the total bilirubin should rise further, owing to the indirect component, and there should be no evidence of anaemia. If the patient is anaemic, haemolysis needs to be excluded by requesting reticulocyte count/lactate dehydrogenase/haptoglobin. If the unconjugated bilirubin is more markedly elevated (> 40 μmol/L) then rarer causes such as Crigler-Najjar syndromeshould be considered and genetic testing undertaken.
Cholestatic — predominantly raised ALP and GGT indicate cholestasis. Common causes include primary biliary cholangitis, PSC, biliary obstruction (stones, strictures, neoplasia, etc), hepatic congestion and drug-induced liver injury. In children, additional disorders that may present with cholestasis include biliary tract abnormalities and genetic disorders of bile synthesis and excretion. However, an isolated raised ALP may be caused by vitamin D deficiency and not be liver related, or it may relate to raised values during periods of rapid growth in childhood, and thus the presence of a concomitantly elevated GGT can help confirm the cause of liver disease. In children with specific inherited disorders of bile acid synthesis and transport, however, GGT is characteristically low or normal. In these disorders, cholestasis occurs without GGT elevation.
Hepatitic — predominantly raised ALT and AST indicate hepatocellular liver injury (hepatitis). Common causes include viral hepatitis, NAFLD, ARLD, AIH and drug-induced liver injury. Details of the approach to these liver blood test abnormalities are given in the subsequent section on outcomes and pathways.

Elevation of alkaline phosphatase — Right upper quadrant ultrasound should be performed in the setting of an elevation of alkaline phosphatase; if normal, evaluation for intrahepatic causes.

### Marked elevation in serum transaminases: an atypical presentation of choledocholithiasis [^ef2bfd1f]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Choledocholithiasis causes elevations in levels of alkaline phosphatase out of proportion to aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT). Isolated marked elevation in AST and ALT levels over 1,000 IU/L has been reported infrequently in patients with choledocholithiasis.

Methods

The charts of 18 patients who presented between 1971 and 2002 with documented choledocholithiasis and AST or ALT levels greater than 1,000 IU/L were retrospectively reviewed. An extensive work-up for coexisting disease processes to account for the abnormal AST and ALT levels was negative.

Results

Eighteen patients (16 women, 16 Hispanics, age 38 ± 3 yr) presented with symptoms of choledocholithiasis and marked transaminase elevation. Peak levels of AST and ALT were 1,062 ± 129 and 1,119 ± 90, respectively. Following successful management of gallstone disease, AST and ALT levels fell rapidly to 129 ± 22 and 268 ± 61, respectively, within 3–14 days. There was also a concomitant improvement in the levels of bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase.

Conclusions

In the absence of other hepatobiliary or pancreatic disease, choledocholithiasis can result in elevations in AST and/or ALT greater than 1,000 IU/L. These levels fall markedly once the gallstone disease is appropriately managed.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^d1ade2b6]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Patterns of liver chemistry test elevations — hepatocellular injury is defined as disproportionate elevation of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels as compared with alkaline phosphatase levels, cholestatic injury is defined as disproportionate elevation in alkaline phosphatase level as compared with AST and ALT levels, mixed pattern of injury is defined as elevation of both alkaline phosphatase and AST/ALT levels, and isolated hyperbilirubinemia is defined as elevation of bilirubin with normal alkaline phosphatase and AST/ALT levels; the R ratio is calculated as R = (ALT value÷ALT ULN)÷(alkaline phosphatase value÷alkaline phosphatase ULN), and an R ratio of > 5 is defined as hepatocellular injury, < 2 cholestatic injury, and 2–5 mixed pattern.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^27744646]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Causes of elevated alkaline phosphatase — Listed hepatobiliary and systemic etiologies include bile duct obstruction, choledocholithiasis, malignant obstruction, bile duct flukes, bile duct stricture, ductopenia, AIDS cholangiopathy, cholestatic liver diseases, primary biliary cirrhosis, primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), medications and drug-induced liver injury, infiltrative diseases such as sarcoid, granulomatous hepatitis, tuberculosis, amyloid, metastatic cancer, lymphoma, hepatic abscess, viral hepatitis, cirrhosis, vanishing bile duct syndrome, ischemic cholangiopathy, benign recurrent cholestasis, alcoholic liver disease, intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, benign post-operative or ICU jaundice, total parenteral nutrition (TPN), liver allograft rejection, acute alcoholic hepatitis, sickle cell liver crisis, sepsis, congestive heart failure, and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis; non-hepatic and additional listed associations include bone disease, osteomalacia, Paget's disease, primary bony malignancy, bony metastases, hyperthyroidism, hyperparathyroidism, pregnancy (third trimester), chronic renal failure, extra-hepatic malignancy, childhood growth, infection, inflammation, influx after a fatty meal, blood type O and B, myeloid metaplasia, peritonitis, diabetes mellitus, gastric ulcer, and increasing age, especially women.

### Hepatic tuberculosis: a multimodality imaging review [^e02de648]. Insights Into Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

Clinical features

Hepatobiliary tuberculosis most commonly affects people in the 11– to 50-year-old age group with the peak incidence of the disease reported in the second decade of life. The disease has a 2:1 male preponderance. Isolated hepatic tuberculosis is however more common in the fourth to sixth decades of life.

Generally, the disease remains silent and is often incidentally detected while the patient is being evaluated for a mostly non-specific symptomatology. It may however present in the form of abdominal pain or organomegaly which may or may not be associated with clinical jaundice. Jaundice if present is usually a consequence of extrahepatic biliary obstruction secondary to attendant periportal lymphadenopathy.

Laboratory analysis may reveal altered liver function tests in the form of elevated hepatic enzymes. The elevation of alkaline phosphatase can be seen in jaundiced as well as non-jaundiced patients. In the event of isolated elevation of the alkaline phosphatase the possibility of tubercular hepatic parenchymal involvement must be excluded.

### The significance of isolated elevation of serum aminotransferases in infants and young children [^5098a1e3]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2007). Low credibility.

Introduction

The aim of this study was to assess the clinical significance and prognosis of a prolonged isolated elevation of serum aminotransferases without cholestasis (> 3 months) in infants and young children, investigated for a variety of conditions, and to determine a protocol for their follow-up and investigation.

Methods

A combined prospective-retrospective analysis of apparently healthy babies and young children with isolated elevation of serum aminotransferases of at least 1.5 times above the norm for age which persisted for at least 3 months and whose creatine phosphokinase (CK), gamma glutamyltransferase (GGT), alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin levels remained normal throughout the study duration. The children underwent the following investigations: abdominal ultrasound and infectious, metabolic and/or immunological investigation depending on the duration of the abnormality.

Results

Six children were eliminated following the finding of positive cytomegalovirus (CMV) antigen in the urine. 72 children were investigated (47 males and 25 females). The duration of serum aminotransferases elevation was 3–36 months (average 12.4, median 11.5 months). The initial, maximal and final alanine aminotransferase (ALT) values were 85.5, 140.5 and 39.8 IU/l, respectively. Of seven children who had liver biopsies performed, three (42.8%) were suspected of having a glycogen storage disease which was not confirmed enzymatically. Four biopsies revealed non-specific histological changes.

Conclusions

Isolated elevation of serum aminotransferases in healthy looking young children is mostly a benign condition that usually resolves within a year. If no pathology is found during routine investigation, these children can be followed conservatively. Liver biopsy does not contribute much to the diagnosis and is probably unnecessary.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® abnormal liver function tests [^38621a59]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Liver function tests are commonly obtained in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. Various overlapping lab patterns can be seen due to derangement of hepatocytes and bile ducts function. Imaging tests are pursued to identify underlying etiology and guide management based on the lab results. Liver function tests may reveal mild, moderate, or severe hepatocellular predominance and can be seen in alcoholic and nonalcoholic liver disease, acute hepatitis, and acute liver injury due to other causes. Cholestatic pattern with elevated alkaline phosphatase with or without elevated γ-glutamyl transpeptidase can be seen with various causes of obstructive biliopathy. Acute or subacute cholestasis with conjugated or unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia can be seen due to prehepatic, intrahepatic, or posthepatic causes. We discuss the initial and complementary imaging modalities to be used in clinical scenarios presenting with abnormal liver function tests. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### Guideline review: EASL clinical practice guidelines: drug-induced liver injury (DILI) [^d3006c51]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

HDS-associated liver toxicity appears to be an emerging determinant of DILI, with wide geographical variability. A prospective study in Iceland purported 16% of DILI related to HDS, while the US Drug-Induced Liver Injury Network reported a similar percentage (16%), with an increase from 7% from 2004 to 2005 to 20% in 2013–2014. Further case–control data suggested rates of 4%–5% in studies in Latin Americaand Germany, respectively.

DILI should be classified according to the dominant pattern of liver enzyme derangement; hepatocellular, cholestatic and mixed injury (figure 1).

Initially, alanine transferase (ALT) activity (patients ALT/upper limit of normal (ULN) of ALT) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity (patients ALP/ULN of ALP) is calculated. Then ALT/ALP ratio (R) is determined. Some of the other commonly encountered phenotypes, and characteristic findings and commonly implicated agents are summarised in table 1.

Table 1
Classification of DILI based on liver enzyme derangement

ALT, ALP and bilirubin are the typical indices used to define liver damage, and liver dysfunction in DILI and serial measurements are necessary to portray extent of hepatocellular injury and DILI phase. ALT is sensitive for hepatocyte injury, particularly alongside an elevated bilirubin and this pattern is a reliable biomarker of liver injury in DILI. Elevated aminotransferases do not reflect the extent to which the liver is damaged, particularly in insidious variants of hepatotoxicity such as indolent fibrosis, vascular liver disorders, cirrhosis and microvesicular steatosis secondary to mitochondrial toxicity. Elevated ALP values usually indicate cholestatic damage, which combined with elevated GGT provides evidence the ALP elevation is of hepatic origin. Isolated hyperbilirubinaemia does not qualify as DILI, given possibility of multiple confounding diagnoses. One important consideration is mild transaminase rises that may be apparent in relation to statin therapy, this may simply reflect an adaptive response and does not represent a true DILI. As such, given the benefit of statins in NAFLD(Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease) and cardiovascular disease such therapies should be continued where feasible.

### Does an abnormally elevated maternal alkaline phosphatase pose problems for the fetus? [^e618422a]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

We report a potential association between an abnormally raised pregnancy level of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). There are few reports of women with abnormally high ALP during pregnancy. However, there is work to suggest an association with placental insufficiency, low birth weight and preterm delivery. In conjunction with a rising ALP, fetal IUGR and intermittent absence of umbilical artery end diastolic flow had evolved. A greatly elevated ALP may be a marker for placental insufficiency and IUGR.

### Transient benign hyperphophatasemia [^b0f49774]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2013). Low credibility.

Background and Aim

Sometimes, a temporary increase in alkaline phosphatase level is found in healthy infants and toddlers without evidence of liver or bone disease. The condition is customarily termed transient benign hyperphosphatasemia of infancy and early childhood. Most textbooks do not refer to the condition. The aim of the study was to promote broader awareness of transient benign hyperphosphatasemia.

Methods

We completed a systematic review of the literature using the principles underlying the UK Economic and Social Research Council guidance on the conduct of narrative synthesis and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses statement.

Results

The 142 reports retained for analysis included 813 cases (male:female ratio 1.1:1.0): 80 in subjects older than 18 years and 733 in subjects 18 years or younger. The alkaline phosphatase ratio, calculated by dividing the measured level by the upper limit of normal, was ≥ 5.0 in ≈70% and the duration of the elevation was ≤ 4 months in 80% of the cases. Transient benign hyperphosphatasemia often followed a benign infection, but available data fail to demonstrate a causal link. The prevalence of transient benign hyperphosphatasemia ranged from 1.1% to 3.5% in infants 2 to 24 months of age.

Conclusions

Transient benign hyperphosphatasemia is likely the most common cause of hyperphosphatasemia among healthy infants and toddlers. Sometimes it also occurs in older children and adults, indicating that the traditional term transient benign hyperphosphatasemia of infancy and early childhood may not be correct. The elevation in alkaline phosphatase persists for > 4 months in ≈20% of the cases. Recognition of this benign condition is crucial to avoid unnecessary investigations.

### Increased bone alkaline phosphatase and isolated subcortical bone uptake of technetium-99m hydroxymethylene diphosphonate in the lower extremities in a patient with Graves' disease: a distinctly unusual variant of Graves' acropachy [^1fdd37fb]. Thyroid (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Thyroid acropachy is an extreme manifestation of autoimmune thyroid disease characterized by soft tissue swelling and periosteal bone changes, usually occurring in the fingers, toes, and lower extremities. Here, a patient with a distinctly unusual variant of thyroid acropachy is presented.

Patient Findings

The patient was a 48-year-old woman with Graves' disease and mild ophthalmopathy, who was euthyroid after treatment with Methimazole. Because of a persistently elevated serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) with elevated bone fraction, a bone scan was performed. This showed increased uptake in the subcortical areas of the lower extremity bones. On questioning, she admitted to mild pain in her lower extremities. She had no other features of thyroid acropachy. Secondary causes of increased ALP, such as cancer, liver disease, and vitamin D deficiency, were excluded by appropriate tests. Therefore, and in view of the patient's underlying Graves' disease, a diagnosis of thyroid acropachy was made.

Summary and Conclusions

Periosteal reaction in the long bones of the lower extremities is unusual in thyroid acropachy, and when it occurs, it is more likely to be associated with overt pain or prominent extrathyroidal manifestations of Graves' disease. This patient very likely had a variant of thyroid acropachy. This variant may be underreported because of its generally asymptomatic nature.

Figure 4 — Algorithm for evaluation of elevated serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) delineates two branches. Under "Normal total bilirubin and serum transaminases", proceed with "History and physical exam confirm with serum GGT"; if "GGT normal → evaluate for non-hepatobiliary etiologies", but if "GGT abnormal → obtain right upper quadrant ultrasound, evaluate for potential hepatotoxic medications, check AMA, ANA, and SMA". If the evaluation is negative, then "If evaluation negative and alkaline phosphatase > 2x ULN → consider liver biopsy" or "If evaluation negative and alkaline phosphatase 1-2x ULN → consider observation", and "If AMA positive → evaluate for primary biliary cirrhosis/cholangitis", with persistence prompting "If persistent elevation of serum alkaline phosphatase after 6 months observation → consider liver biopsy". Under "Elevated serum transaminases ± elevated bilirubin", perform "History and physical exam Check right upper quadrant ultrasound"; if "If ductal dilatation → ERCP, MRCP" and if "If no ductal dilatation → check AMA, ANA, SMA". Next, "If AMA positive → evaluate for primary biliary cirrhosis/cholangitis", whereas "If AMA negative and alkaline phosphatase > 2x ULN → consider liver biopsy or MRCP" or "If AMA negative and alkaline phosphatase 1-2x ULN → consider observation", and persistent elevation leads to "If persistent elevation of serum alkaline phosphatase after 6 months observation → consider liver biopsy or MRCP".

WARNING: TOXIC DEATHS, HEPATOTOXICITY, NEUTROPENIA, HYPERSENSITIVITY REACTIONS, and FLUID RETENTION

Treatment-related mortality associated with docetaxel is increased in patients with abnormal liver function, in patients receiving higher doses, and in patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma and a history of prior treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy who receive docetaxel as a single agent at a dose of 100 mg/m [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Avoid the use of docetaxel in patients with bilirubin > upper limit of normal (ULN), or to patients with AST and/or ALT > 1.5 × ULN concomitant with alkaline phosphatase > 2.5 × ULN. Patients with elevations of bilirubin or abnormalities of transaminase concurrent with alkaline phosphatase are at increased risk for the development of severe neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, infections, severe thrombocytopenia, severe stomatitis, severe skin toxicity, and toxic death. Patients with isolated elevations of transaminase > 1.5 × ULN also had a higher rate of febrile neutropenia. Measure bilirubin, AST or ALT, and alkaline phosphatase prior to each cycle of docetaxel [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Do not administer docetaxel to patients with neutrophil counts of < 1500 cells/mm. Monitor blood counts frequently as neutropenia may be severe and result in infection [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

### Adult Paget's disease of bone: a review [^3a0beb85]. Rheumatology (2017). Low credibility.

Adult PD of bone is the second commonest metabolic bone condition after osteoporosis. The condition is characterized by increased bone cell activity, with bone-resorbing osteoclasts often larger and containing more nuclei than normal, and osteoblasts producing increased amounts of disorganized bone. This leads to expanded bone of poor quality possessing both sclerotic and lytic areas. PD of bone has a strong genetic element, with a family history being noted in 10–20% of cases. A number of genetic defects have been found to be associated with the condition. The most common disease-associated variants identified affect the SQSTM1 gene, providing insights into disease aetiology, with the clinical value of knowledge of SQSTM1 mutation status currently under active investigation. The diagnosis may be suggested by an isolated raised total ALP without other identifiable causes. This can be confirmed on plain X-rays and the extent determined by isotope bone scan. The mainstays of treatment are the bisphosphonates, especially i.v. zoledronate, which results in long-term suppression of bone turnover. ALP is the usual means of monitoring the condition, although more specific bone turnover markers can be helpful, especially in coincident liver disease. Patients should be followed up to monitor for biochemical relapse or development of complications, which may require medical or surgical intervention.

Confirmed alkaline phosphatase elevations — primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is described as "an uncommon chronic liver disease" that "is seen more commonly in women than men", with symptoms such as "fatigue and pruritus". Testing highlights cholestasis and characteristic serology: "Lab testing reveals biochemical evidence of cholestasis (elevated alkaline phosphatase with or without elevation of bilirubin), as well as the serologic hallmark for screening and diagnosis: immunoglobulin M and PBC-specific anti-mitochondrial antibodies (AMA) in up to 95% of patients (64)". Histology is selective: "Liver biopsy is not routinely required although may be beneficial in patients with suspected anti-mitochondrial antibody-negative disease and to stage liver fibrosis".

### Alkaline phosphatase: discovery and naming of our favorite enzyme [^2acf770d]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2018). Low credibility.

Alkaline phosphatase can be considered "our favorite enzyme" for reasons apparent to those who diagnose and treat metabolic bone diseases or who study skeletal biology. Few might know, however, that alkaline phosphatase likely represents the most frequently assayed enzyme in all of medicine. Elevated activity in the circulation is universally recognized as a marker for skeletal or hepatobiliary disease. Nevertheless, the assay conditions in many ways are nonphysiological. The term alkaline phosphatase emerged when it became necessary to distinguish "bone phosphatase" from the phosphatase in the prostate that features an acidic pH optimum. Beginning in 1948, studies of the inborn-error-of-metabolism hypophosphatasia would identify the natural substrates and establish the physiological role of alkaline phosphatase, including in biomineralization. Here, we recount the discovery in 1923 and then eventual naming of this enzyme that remains paramount in our field. © 2017 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

Abnormal liver chemistries — bilirubin and cholestasis evaluation: In contrast to indirect hyperbilirubinemia, conjugated (direct) hyperbilirubinemia generally implies the presence of parenchymal liver damage or biliary obstruction. There are two rare inherited conditions associated with direct hyperbilirubinemia: Dubin–Johnson syndrome and Rotor syndrome. An elevated bilirubin should be evaluated by determining conjugated and unconjugated fractions of bilirubin. If there are signs of acute liver failure, urgent hepatology consultation with referral to a liver transplant center should be undertaken immediately. Those who present with an elevation in alkaline phosphatase with normal AST, ALT, and bilirubin levels should have their alkaline phosphatase elevation confirmed with a GGT level and if elevated a right upper quadrant ultrasound of the liver should be ordered. If the imaging is normal, autoimmune markers should be ordered. A liver biopsy may ultimately be required to obtain a diagnosis. Extrahepatic causes such as hemolysis should also be assessed.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^a080bacb]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

ACG Clinical Guideline — initial evaluation steps for abnormal liver chemistries emphasize confirming true abnormalities, medication/supplement review, selective biopsy, and GGT use. Before initiating a workup, repeat the laboratory panel and/or perform a clarifying test to confirm the abnormality. Physicians should ask about prescribed/over‑the‑counter drugs, complementary/alternative medicines, and dietary/herbal supplements that may be associated with drug‑induced liver injury (DILI). A liver biopsy is recommended when serologic testing and imaging fails to elucidate a diagnosis, to stage a condition, or when multiple diagnoses are possible. An elevation of alkaline phosphatase should be confirmed with an elevation in gamma‑glutamyl transferase (GGT), and GGT should not be used as a screening test for underlying liver disease without other abnormal chemistries. All are stated as Strong recommendation, very low level of evidence.

### Persistently elevated alkaline phosphatase [^ff84e3bc]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

A 32-year-old overweight asymptomatic man was found to have a persistently raised serum alkaline phosphatase at 250–300&emsp14; U/l (normal range < 130). Other liver function tests were unremarkable apart from an initial marginally elevated alanine transaminase, which normalised with weight reduction. Abdominal imaging revealed a fatty liver but an extensive serological search for significant hepatobiliary disease was negative. Subsequent isoenzyme electrophoresis revealed normal liver and bone fractions of alkaline phosphatase but a grossly elevated intestinal fraction. Elevated intestinal fraction of alkaline phosphatase should be considered in the investigation of unexplained alkaline phosphatase, particularly when the usual associated hepatobiliary and bony pathologies are not present. Although an elevated intestinal fraction of alkaline phosphatase can be linked to significant gastrointestinal pathology, this case report highlights that it can be a benign biochemical finding.

### Associations of serum alkaline phosphatase with metabolic syndrome and mortality [^adb67f47]. The American Journal of Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Recent data suggest that elevated serum alkaline phosphatase levels are associated with increased mortality, but the mechanisms for this association are unknown. As metabolic syndrome is associated with higher serum alkaline phosphatase levels, we examined the joint association of mortality with metabolic syndrome and serum alkaline phosphatase levels in the US general population.

Methods

Retrospective observational study of 15,234 adult participants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III. Multivariable Cox regression analyses were used to jointly relate mortality risk to serum alkaline phosphatase and indicators of metabolic syndrome.

Results

Prevalence of metabolic syndrome was 14% to 41% among patients in lowest and higher quartiles, respectively, for baseline serum alkaline phosphatase. The mortality hazard ratio for each doubling of serum alkaline phosphatase was 1.52 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.35–1.72) adjusting only for demographic factors, and 1.37 (95% CI, 1.21–1.56) adjusting for both demographic and metabolic syndrome factors in the full cohort, and was 1.83 (95% CI, 1.36–2.46) adjusting for demographic factors in the subgroup without any of the component conditions of metabolic syndrome.

Conclusions

In the US general population, higher levels of serum alkaline phosphatase is a predictor of mortality independent of the baseline prevalence of metabolic syndrome. Further studies are warranted to unravel the mechanisms of this association.

Response to abnormal liver blood tests: outcomes and pathways￼

As indicated in figure 1 the presence of unexplained clinical jaundice or suspicion of possible hepatic or biliary malignancy should lead to an immediate referral. In all other adults with incidentally raised liver enzymes it is important to take a careful history and perform a targeted clinical examination to look for the cause. Liver enzymes can occasionally be raised owing to intercurrent illness, although when liver blood tests were repeated, 84% of tests remained abnormal on retesting after 1 month, and even at 2 years 75% remained abnormal. Thus, in a patient with abnormal liver blood tests it is not recommended to simply repeat the same panel of tests but to determine the cause unless there is a high index of clinical suspicion that it is a transient finding. In children, there should be a low threshold for referral to a paediatrician for further investigation, as the most common causes of liver dysfunction in adults are less common in children, and there is a wider differential diagnosis.

Figure 1
Response to abnormal liver blood tests. This figure details the initial response to abnormal liver blood tests. Boxes in yellow indicate the initial evaluation of the clinical presentation. Patients with marked derangement of liver blood tests, synthetic failure and/or suspicious clinical symptoms/signs should be considered for urgent referral to secondary care (red box). For the remainder, a clinical history alongside evaluation of the pattern of liver blood test derangement will determine choice of pathway and is shown in the grey boxes. A grey box indicates all the tests that should be requested at that stage rather than a hierarchy within it. The presence of metabolic syndrome criteria should be sought to support a diagnosis of NAFLD. For children, the text should be consulted for modification of recommendation. Areas of diagnostic uncertainty are indicated in orange boxes and the decision for repeat testing or referral to secondary care will be influenced by the magnitude of enzyme elevation and clinical context.

Genotype–phenotype correlation

Although XLH seems to be completely penetrant, its severity varies widely, even among family members, with no clear gender difference. A large number of inactivating mutations in PHEX can cause XLH, and a genotype–phenotype correlation is not obvious.

Further patient work-up

Patients should be evaluated for the presence and severity of common and rare complications of XLH depending on their age (Table 1). In young children, dynamic tests or specific investigations, such as hearing evaluation or oral examination, are sometimes not feasible and can be delayed until the child reaches 3–5 years of age.

What constitutes a standard liver blood test panel?

There are remarkably few data to determine what an optimal liver blood test panel should include, although this would be influenced by the clinical setting. The Health Technology Assessment commissioned Birmingham and Lambeth Liver Evaluation Testing Strategies (BALLETS) study reported that ALT and ALP identified the vast majority of adults with necro-inflammatory liver disease. The routine addition of GGT led to a marginal increase in sensitivity but at the cost of a loss of specificity and a higher false-positive rate. But the analysis did not include adults with NAFLD or alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD), which account for 90% of liver mortality, in whom liver blood tests and the follow-on liver aetiology screen are seldom diagnostic. In this setting GGT and AST would aid the sensitivity of detecting such patients. Addition of GGT to a liver blood test panel increases the likelihood of an adult having abnormal liver blood tests from around 15% to 30%and, notably, a raised GGT is associated with increased liver as well as all-cause (including cancer) mortality, with the greatest risk being observed in those with the most significant elevations of GGT. In addition, the routine addition of AST to the initial panel did not improve the detection of specific disease.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^9f945fab]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

ACG Clinical Guideline — abnormal liver chemistries evaluation and interpretation states that serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin are the most common liver chemistries; hepatocellular injury is defined as disproportionate elevation of AST and ALT compared with alkaline phosphatase, whereas cholestatic injury is defined as disproportionate elevation of alkaline phosphatase as compared with AST and ALT. A true healthy normal ALT level ranges from 29 to 33 IU/l for males, 19 to 25 IU/l for females and levels above this should be assessed. Evaluation of hepatocellular injury includes testing for viral hepatitis A, B, and C; assessment for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and alcoholic liver disease; screening for hereditary hemochromatosis, autoimmune hepatitis, Wilson's disease, and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency; and a history of prescribed and over-the-counter medicines should be sought. For alkaline phosphatase elevation determined to be of hepatic origin, testing for primary biliary cholangitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis should be pursued. Total bilirubin elevation can occur from hepatocellular or cholestatic diseases; elevated total serum bilirubin levels should be fractionated to direct and indirect bilirubin fractions, and an elevated serum conjugated bilirubin implies hepatocellular disease or biliary obstruction in most settings. A liver biopsy may be considered when serologic testing and imaging fails to elucidate a diagnosis, to stage a condition, or when multiple diagnoses are possible.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^b59e34c7]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

γ-Glutamyltransferase (GGT) is abundant in the liver and also present in the kidney, intestine, prostate and pancreas but not in bone; therefore it can be useful in confirming that an elevated ALP is of liver and not bony origin.GGT is most commonly elevated as a result of obesity, excess alcohol consumption or may be induced by drugs. Although an elevated GGT has a low specificity for liver disease, it is one of the best predictors of liver mortality. It is particularly useful in children to establish the likelihood of biliary disease when ALP is not a reliable indicator. Predominant causes of cholestasis in children include congenital abnormalities of the biliary tract and genetic disorders affecting bile synthesis and excretion.

What other conditions should be considered in the differential diagnosis of PBC?

The diagnosis of PBC usually causes little confusion because of the specificity and sensitivity of PBC-associated autoantibodies. Care must be taken in autoantibody-negative disease, with the chief differential being small duct PSC. Other differential diagnoses which should be considered include sarcoid, graft-versus-host disease (in appropriately at-risk individuals), idiopathic ductopenia, drug-induced liver injury and variants of genetic cholestatic syndromes. Care must also be taken with patients with 'low titre' AMA because of the danger of autoantibody false positivity in inflammatory conditions, in particular NAFLD, where low level rises in ALP are not infrequent.

How is PBC diagnosed?

Modes and routes of presentation

Increased awareness of the serological associations of PBC and the widespread use of blood test-based screening in the community has led to an evolution of the mode of presentation of PBC in recent years, away from presentation with clinically overt disease (eg, advanced liver disease)towards presentation following identification of liver biochemical abnormality on screening(figure 1). Increasing awareness of PBC as a cause of chronic fatigue and pruritus may have led to an increase in diagnosis following symptomatic presentation. Given the efficacy of UDCA treatment in slowing disease progression, it makes sense that early diagnosis may facilitate better outcomes. Treatment failure is seen more commonly in those presenting with cirrhosis and in the ductopenic variant of PBC. Despite awareness of PBC and its target demographic, occasional patients still present with very advanced disease at the point of needing liver transplantation.

Figure 1
The BSG/UK-PBC consensus care pathway for patients with primary biliary cholangitis (PBC). While care needs always to be personalised to the patient, there are consensus pathways that are important for patients with PBC, which encompass the important 'pillars' of care that are believed to provide optimal management of disease and its complications.

Blood tests

The diagnostic accuracy of the combination of cholestatic serum liver tests and PBC-specific serological markers (> 95% for both sensitivity and specificity) means that blood tests lie at the heart of PBC diagnosis.

Liver biochemistry

PBC is characterised, in its early stages, by elevation in serum ALP and GGT. Multiple studies on the biochemical response to UDCA therapy demonstrate the value of ALP following therapy as a useful prognostic marker. It is unclear at present whether ALP values are markers of response to other emerging forms of therapy in PBC, but recent Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulatory review has suggested there is at least reasonable evidence to consider ALP as a surrogate marker of treatment efficacy in PBC. Elevation in bilirubin and fall in serum albumin are features of advanced disease and are also important prognostic markers. Given the more diverse causes of elevations in GGT, to date the utility of GGT determination in patients with PBC has been to confirm a biliary origin of ALP, and not usually to reach a diagnosis or guide therapy. Further studies need to be performed before GGT can replace ALP with regard to diagnosis and treatment, although in the context of classical cholestasis a strong correlation between the two laboratory markers exists.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^5b449e9b]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Abnormal liver chemistries — bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, albumin, and prothrombin time interpretation includes that an elevated GGT suggests that the alkaline phosphatase elevation is of hepatic origin, alkaline phosphatase levels increase in children and the elderly, especially females over 50 years of age, and the total serum bilirubin is usually < 1.1 mg/dl with an elevated direct bilirubin indicating hepatocellular dysfunction or cholestasis; fractionation of total bilirubin is most helpful when the ALT, AST, and alkaline phosphatase levels are normal or near normal, and if the total bilirubin is elevated and fractionation shows the majority of the elevation is unconjugated bilirubin, hepatocellular disease is unlikely; albumin is a plasma protein exclusively synthesized by the liver with a circulating half-life of 3 weeks, a reduction in albumin (normal ≥ 3.5 g/dl) usually indicates liver disease of more than 3 weeks duration, and prothrombin time may be prolonged in patients with severe liver disease of < 24 h duration.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^f8c52eff]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Clinicians are required to assess abnormal liver chemistries on a daily basis. The most common liver chemistries ordered are serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin. These tests should be termed liver chemistries or liver tests. Hepatocellular injury is defined as disproportionate elevation of AST and ALT levels compared with alkaline phosphatase levels. Cholestatic injury is defined as disproportionate elevation of alkaline phosphatase level as compared with AST and ALT levels. The majority of bilirubin circulates as unconjugated bilirubin and an elevated conjugated bilirubin implies hepatocellular disease or cholestasis. Multiple studies have demonstrated that the presence of an elevated ALT has been associated with increased liver-related mortality. A true healthy normal ALT level ranges from 29 to 33IU/l for males, 19 to 25IU/l for females and levels above this should be assessed. The degree of elevation of ALT and or AST in the clinical setting helps guide the evaluation. The evaluation of hepatocellular injury includes testing for viral hepatitis A, B, and C, assessment for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and alcoholic liver disease, screening for hereditary hemochromatosis, autoimmune hepatitis, Wilson's disease, and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. In addition, a history of prescribed and over-the-counter medicines should be sought. For the evaluation of an alkaline phosphatase elevation determined to be of hepatic origin, testing for primary biliary cholangitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis should be undertaken. Total bilirubin elevation can occur in either cholestatic or hepatocellular diseases. Elevated total serum bilirubin levels should be fractionated to direct and indirect bilirubin fractions and an elevated serum conjugated bilirubin implies hepatocellular disease or biliary obstruction in most settings. A liver biopsy may be considered when serologic testing and imaging fails to elucidate a diagnosis, to stage a condition, or when multiple diagnoses are possible.

### Diagnosis and management of Paget's disease of bone in adults: a clinical guideline [^634b444d]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Treatment of increased metabolic activity or symptoms?

The Paget's Disease, Randomized Trial of Intensive versus Symptomatic Management (PRISM) study compared the effects of a treat to target strategy aimed at normalizing total ALP compared with a strategy aimed at controlling symptoms 54 in 1324 patients with PDB. The average age of participants at entry to the study was about 74 years with an average disease duration of 8 years. About 70% of patients had previously been treated with bisphosphonates; about 47% had elevated total ALP values at baseline, and 46% had bone pain thought to be caused by PDB. There was a poor correlation between presence of bone pain thought to be due to PDB and an elevated ALP value, however. 54 Participants randomized to receive "intensive" bisphosphonate treatment (n = 661) were prescribed bisphosphonates with the aim of maintaining or suppressing total ALP values to within the reference range irrespective of whether bone pain was present. Risedronate sodium was the bisphosphonate of first choice, but any licensed bisphosphonate could be used. In the symptomatic group (n = 663), the therapeutic goal was to control bone pain. This was initially attempted using analgesics, but if the response was inadequate, non‐nitrogen‐containing bisphosphonates or calcitonin were used first followed by nitrogen‐containing bisphosphonates if necessary. The primary endpoint was clinical fracture. Secondary endpoints included fractures through Pagetic bone, orthopedic procedures, quality of life assessed by SF36, HAQ and EQ5D, bone pain, bone deformity, progression of hearing loss in patients with skull involvement assessed by audiometry, and adverse events. PRISM was an event‐driven study, which was stopped when 95 clinical fractures occurred. The average duration or follow‐up was 3 years with a range of 2 to 4 years.

The PRISM‐extension with zoledronic acid study (PRISM‐EZ) employed the same strategy as in PRISM, but zoledronic acid was used as the treatment of first choice in the intensive arm. 113 Patients within PRISM‐EZ maintained the same treatment allocation as they had been randomized to in PRISM. The PRISM‐EZ study followed 270 patients in the intensive group and 232 in the symptomatic group, providing an average total duration of 7.3 years follow‐up since the beginning of the PRISM study. The primary and secondary endpoints were the same in PRISM‐EZ as in PRISM, except that patients did not undergo audiometry in the extension.

### High alkaline phosphatase levels in hemodialysis patients are associated with higher risk of hospitalization and death [^6fdde178]. Kidney International (2008). Low credibility.

We evaluated risks associated with elevated alkaline phosphatase in hemodialysis patients using longitudinal data from the Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study, a prospective observational study of hemodialysis patients in 12 countries. Alkaline phosphatase levels were normalized by the upper limit of the laboratory-reported reference range. Cause-specific hospitalization and mortality risks were evaluated using Cox proportional hazards models, stratified by region and adjusted for phosphorus, calcium, albumin, parathyroid hormone, case mix, and numerous comorbidities. The odds of high normalized alkaline phosphatase were increased twofold in the United States in comparison to Japan. Elevations of normalized alkaline phosphatase were significantly associated with several comorbid conditions, increased fractures, parathyroidectomy, risk of hospitalization due to major adverse cardiac events, higher all-cause cardiovascular, and infection-related mortality risk. Our results also show that elevated serum normalized alkaline phosphatase was associated with higher risks of hospitalization and death in hemodialysis patients, independent of calcium, phosphorus, and parathyroid hormone levels.

### Rhabdomyolysis attributed to terbinafine: a rare occurrence that can be mistaken for terbinafine-induced hepatotoxicity [^3cafe415]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Terbinafine is an oral antifungal agent that can cause hepatotoxicity. Early detection of hepatic dysfunction should prompt immediate discontinuation of this medication. Drug-induced liver injury can result in acute hepatitis, cholestasis, or a mixed picture. Although abnormal liver function test results might vary depending on the type of injury, most cases of terbinafine-induced hepatotoxicity present with elevations in AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyl transferase, and bilirubin. Trivial elevations of < 1.2 times the upper limit of normal for ALT, AST, and bilirubin have occurred in < 10% of cases. Common symptoms of liver injury include jaundice, icterus, flu-like symptoms, dark urine, or pruritus. Our patient presented with an isolated elevation in transaminases with only symptoms of muscle pain and weakness. His clinical picture was not consistent with terbinafine-induced hepatotoxicity; therefore, further investigation was pursued.

Rhabdomyolysis associated with terbinafine use is a rare occurrence. When evaluating a patient on terbinafine with an isolated elevation in aminotransferases, rhabdomyolysis should be considered. In a retrospective study of 215 cases of rhabdomyolysis with a CK ≥ 1000 U/L, the AST was elevated in 93% cases and ALT in 75% of cases. An elevated AST:ALT ratio might also support rhabdomyolysis, as the leakage of intracellular contents from skeletal muscles precipitates a favorable elevation of AST. Patients should be evaluated clinically for symptoms of rhabdomyolysis, including weakness, myalgia, and darkened urine. Additional laboratory testing should be performed to distinguish rhabdomyolysis from drug-induced liver injury. This additional testing should include CK level, urine myoglobin, creatinine, and electrolytes including potassium. Diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis can be made in the presence of an acute neuromuscular illness or dark urine, plus a marked elevation in serum CK. Treatment is largely supportive with correction of electrolyte abnormalities and proper hydration to prevent kidney injury.

### Tumour-derived alkaline phosphatase regulates tumour growth, epithelial plasticity and disease-free survival in metastatic prostate cancer [^989614c7]. British Journal of Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

Alkaline phosphatase activity in serum, a measure of alkaline phosphatase expressed by osteoblasts, has long been used as an indicator of increased bone remodelling, and hence, bone metastatic disease in prostate cancer. Activity is thought to reflect alkaline phosphatase originating from bone, liver and kidney. Our data demonstrate that alkaline phosphatase is expressed in prostate cancer cells, with a significant differential expression in mesenchymal prostate cancer cells compared with their epithelial counterpart. This is supported by our analysis of the Tomlins et al. data set, where expression of alkaline phosphatase in metastatic samples was much higher compared with primary prostate cancer samples. Importantly, this data set was generated from prostate cancer cells isolated by laser capture microdissection from the primary or metastatic site, thus removing the risk of contamination from surrounding stromal cells. The clinical importance of tumour-derived alkaline phosphatase in prostate cancer is evident from the significant decrease in disease-free survival in patients with high expression of alkaline phosphatase in the Taylor et al. data set.

### Evaluation of abnormal liver tests in the adult asymptomatic patient [^37f87728]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Liver blood tests, including bilirubin, aminotransferases, and alkaline phosphatase, are among the most commonly encountered tests in medicine. With roles including the investigation of symptoms, medication monitoring, assessment of chronic disease, and routine assessment, these tests serve many purposes and result in abnormality in up to 40% of patients.

Recent Findings

The toll of liver disease continues to rise and abnormal liver tests offer an opportunity to identify hepatic disease early, when treatment is most effective and before patients suffer the potential downstream consequences of cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and hepatocellular carcinoma. By utilizing diagnostic strategies including detailed history gathering, alcohol use assessment, recognition of metabolic syndrome, and identifying patterns of liver test abnormalities, clinicians can develop a systematic approach to address abnormal liver tests. For these reasons, developing an evidence-based, systematic approach to handling abnormal liver tests is critically important.

Summary

This review seeks to synthesize key elements of the best evidence, presently available guidelines, and expert opinion in drafting a strategy to aid clinicians and patients in the timely and accurate diagnosis of liver disease for the adult asymptomatic patient with abnormal liver tests.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^abd53d51]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries — initial steps should confirm the abnormality and structure history and examination. Before initiation of evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries, one should repeat the lab panel and/or perform a clarifying test (e.g. GGT if serum alkaline phosphatase is elevated) to confirm that the liver chemistry is actually abnormal. The initial history should assess risk factors for liver diseases including viral hepatitis, metabolic liver disease, exposures to toxins, and medications including alcohol and complementary-alternative medicines, associated diseases including inflammatory bowel disease, hematologic diseases, pulmonary disease, and cardiac disease as well as hereditary forms of liver disease. In those who present with jaundice and abdominal pain, obtaining a history of prior hepatobiliary disease including gallstones and inflammatory bowel disease is recommended. The physical examination of a patient with abnormal liver tests is typically normal, but certain findings might help to confirm the presence of chronic liver disease including jaundice, ascites, splenomegaly, palmar erythema, spiders, and hepatic encephalopathy.

### Tumour-derived alkaline phosphatase regulates tumour growth, epithelial plasticity and disease-free survival in metastatic prostate cancer [^6a4e3f56]. British Journal of Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Results

Alkaline phosphatase is expressed by prostate cancer cells and increased in metastatic prostate cancer

Circulating alkaline phosphatase is well known to be elevated in prostate cancer-induced bone disease, indicative of osteoblast-derived alkaline phosphatase resulting in increased bone formation. In contrast, the expression and function of tumour-derived alkaline phosphatase is poorly understood. To determine the expression of alkaline phosphatase specifically in prostate cancer cells, we first examined a panel of prostate cancer cell lines that vary in their in vivo metastatic potential, demonstrating high gene expression in some, but not all, metastatic prostate cancer cell lines (Figure 1A). Low to non-existent expression was observed in the non-tumourigenic normal human prostate epithelium cell lines PNT1A and PNT2, and in MCF-7 breast cancer cells, previously demonstrated to exhibit low basal levels of alkaline phosphatase expression. Using the paired cell lines ARCaPE and ARCaPM, which differ in their metastatic ability, we demonstrated a significant increase in ALPL expression and alkaline phosphatase enzymatic activity in metastatic ARCaPM cells as compared with non-metastatic ARCaPE cells, with prostate cancer cells demonstrating increased alkaline phosphatase activity per mg protein as compared with 2T3 preosteoblasts (Figure 1B–D, Supplementary Data Figure S1). We also observed differences in the ability of ARCaPE and ARCaPM cells to mineralise, with only ARCAPM cells staining positively for Alizarin Red, indicating the presence of calcium deposits and mineralisation (Supplementary Data Figure S2). To determine the clinical relevance of alkaline phosphatase expression in prostate cancer cells, we analysed gene expression data from a publicly available data set in which prostate cancer cells from primary and metastatic sites were isolated by laser capture microdissection. A significant increase in ALPL expression was detected in metastatic prostate cancer cells as compared with localised prostate cancer (Figure 1E).

### Diagnosis and management of Paget's disease of bone in adults: a clinical guideline [^3cd48a7b]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Biochemical markers

The elevations in bone remodeling that are characteristic of active PBD can be detected clinically by measurement of biochemical markers of bone turnover in blood and urine samples. It should be noted, however, that elevations in markers of bone turnover occur in many disease states and cannot be used in isolation for the diagnosis of PDB.

The most widely used biochemical marker for the diagnosis of PDB is serum total alkaline phosphatase (ALP), which is usually performed as part of liver function tests in a routine biochemistry screen. A population‐based study by Eekhof (68) specifically looked at the performance of ALP in detecting PDB in participants of the Rotterdam study in Holland. The researchers selected 105 individuals from a cohort of 4406 subjects who had an elevated total ALP with normal transaminases and matched these subjects with 625 controls who had a normal total ALP. They found that the relative risk for PDB (based on radiographs of the hands, spine, pelvis, and knees) in the presence of a raised total ALP was 10.9 (95% CI 4.8–24.9) in men and women older than 55 years of age. 68 This is the only study that has addressed the accuracy of any biochemical marker for the diagnosis of PDB. It showed that the sensitivity of total ALP was 57.7% (95% CI 38.9–74.5); specificity 88.9% (95% CI 85.9–91.3); positive likelihood ratio 5.19 (95% CI 3.45–7.82); and negative likelihood ratio 0.48 (95% CI 0.30–0.75). It should be noted that the calculated sensitivity may be an underestimate because radiographic assessment of PDB in the study didn't include the skull and some patients with PDB of this site could have been missed. It's also important to emphasize that of 26 patients with radiological features of PDB, only 11 (42%) had elevated total ALP concentrations.

### Primary biliary cirrhosis presented as peripheral eosinophilia in asymptomatic women with or without elevated alkaline phosphatase [^9304f021]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2004). Low credibility.

Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is a chronic cholestatic liver disease characterized by the destruction of biliary epithelial cells, presumably by autoimmune mechanism(s). Although lymphocytes play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of PBC, the possible involvement of eosinophils has also been suggested. Recent studies have shown that eosinophilia possibly occurs in the peripheral blood of PBC patients. We present four cases of asymptomatic middle-aged women with moderate-to-high eosinophilia observed during random investigation. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) was increased in two of them. As a result of clinical and laboratory evaluations the early stages of PBC were diagnosed in all the patients, as attested by the detection of high titres of anti-mitochondrial antibodies and the characteristic lesions on liver biopsies. Liver function tests and eosinophils returned within normal limits after 2 months of treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid, suggesting that its potential immunomodulatory actions may extend to eosinophils. Our report further supports the possibility that eosinophilia may occur in PBC, especially in its early stages. From the clinical point of view, we believe that PBC should be considered in the differential diagnosis of eosinophilia with an otherwise unknown origin. In particular, PBC should be suspected in a patient when other causes of eosinophilia have been excluded, irrespective of the presence or absence of symptoms, or the presence or absence of elevated ALP. In such cases further evaluation for anti-mitochondrial antibodies should be done. These observations might assist the development of future therapeutic concepts in the management of PBC, at least for patients in early stages of the disease.

### Hypophosphatasia-aetiology, nosology, pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment [^2114066b]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2016). Medium credibility.

Hypophosphatasia is the inborn error of metabolism characterized by low serum alkaline phosphatase activity (hypophosphatasaemia). This biochemical hallmark reflects loss-of-function mutations within the gene that encodes the tissue-nonspecific isoenzyme of alkaline phosphatase (TNSALP). TNSALP is a cell-surface homodimeric phosphohydrolase that is richly expressed in the skeleton, liver, kidney and developing teeth. In hypophosphatasia, extracellular accumulation of TNSALP natural substrates includes inorganic pyrophosphate, an inhibitor of mineralization, which explains the dento-osseous and arthritic complications featuring tooth loss, rickets or osteomalacia, and calcific arthopathies. Severely affected infants sometimes also have hypercalcaemia and hyperphosphataemia due to the blocked entry of minerals into the skeleton, and pyridoxine-dependent seizures from insufficient extracellular hydrolysis of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, the major circulating form of vitamin B6, required for neurotransmitter synthesis. Autosomal recessive or dominant inheritance from ~300 predominantly missense ALPL (also known as TNSALP) mutations largely accounts for the remarkably broad-ranging expressivity of hypophosphatasia. High serum concentrations of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate represent a sensitive and specific biochemical marker for hypophosphatasia. Also, phosphoethanolamine levels are usually elevated in serum and urine, though less reliably for diagnosis. TNSALP mutation detection is important for recurrence risk assessment and prenatal diagnosis. Diagnosing paediatric hypophosphatasia is aided by pathognomic radiographic changes when the skeletal disease is severe. Hypophosphatasia was the last type of rickets or osteomalacia to await a medical treatment. Now, significant successes for severely affected paediatric patients are recognized using asfotase alfa, a bone-targeted recombinant TNSALP.

### Clinical practice recommendations for the diagnosis and management of X-linked hypophosphataemia [^ab8d8dcf]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2019). High credibility.

Biochemical characteristics

The biochemical hallmarks of XLH are hypophosphataemia due to renal phosphate wasting, increased alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels and elevated intact FGF23 levels. A positive family history of XLH, elevated ALP levels, decreased serum phosphate concentrations associated with renal phosphate wasting and/or the identification of a PHEX mutation can help to identify affected children within the first weeks of life. Of note, serum levels of phosphate might be in the normal range within the first 3–4 months of life. Renal phosphate wasting should be evaluated by calculating the tubular maximum reabsorption of phosphate per glomerular filtration rate (TmP/GFR)(Table 1). In patients with insufficient phosphate intake, or impaired intestinal absorption (which might be suspected by low urinary levels of phosphate), TmP/GFR can be falsely low until serum levels of phosphate are restored to normal. Although, plasma levels of intact FGF23 are usually elevated, normal levels of FGF23 do not exclude XLH but should be interpreted as inappropriately normal in the setting of hypophosphataemia. FGF23 levels are also influenced by other factors, in particular phosphate intake and vitamin D therapy. Therefore, FGF23 levels are most informative in untreated patients. FGF23 levels are elevated in several other forms of hypophosphataemic rickets (Table 2), and the normal range varies considerably according to the assay used. Serum concentrations of calcium are usually in the lower normal range, and urinary calcium is low owing to impaired 1,25(OH)₂ vitamin D synthesis and consequently decreased intestinal calcium absorption. In contrast to calcipenic rickets, parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels are usually at the upper limit of the normal range or even slightly elevated. Circulating levels of 1,25(OH)₂ vitamin D are low or inappropriately normal in the setting of hypophosphataemia.

Paget's disease of bone — presenting signs and skeletal features include that many patients are asymptomatic and the disease is discovered when a radiograph or bone scan is performed for another indication or when an elevated serum ALP level is found on a multiphasic screening chemistry panel; patients usually have a single bone or several bones affected, with the pelvis, vertebrae, skull, femur, and tibia most frequently involved; a hallmark is skeletal deformity with increased size and/or abnormal shape, increased warmth over an affected bone (usually the tibia) attributed to increased blood flow, and skeletal growth or expansion that becomes clinically obvious when the skull, jaw, clavicle, femur, or tibia are involved.

### Liver function predicts survival in patients undergoing extracorporeal membrane oxygenation following cardiovascular surgery [^0d3f8f3d]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Generally, elevation of alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin is considered as a cholestatic pattern. Cholestasis is defined as a decline of bile flow into the duodenum that may be caused by impaired secretion by hepatocytes or obstruction through intra- or extrahepatic bile ducts. Particularly, adverse effects of medications and systemic sepsis may be the underlying mechanism for elevated cholestatic parameters in the present study cohort. As preoperative bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase levels were in the upper normal range or only slightly elevated in the present study population, significant cholestasis is not suggested to be the sole organic correlate for poor outcome. The commonality of our study population is the severe cardiovascular disease that may itself affect liver function. The pathophysiology of cardiac hepatopathy is, on one hand, impaired arterial perfusion caused by acute heart failure and, on the other hand, passive congestion resulting from an increased central venous pressure due to elevated right ventricular pressure and right-sided heart failure. Mostly, forward and backward failure coexist and aggravate each other in patients with severe heart failure. Furthermore, hepatic derangements are not necessarily caused by primary liver disease, but may be a consequence of severe illness and may represent a surrogate marker of the generalized stress response.

In line with our results, elevated levels of alkaline phosphatase or bilirubin were identified to predict all-cause mortality, cardiovascular death, or hospitalization for heart failure in patients with advanced heart failure. Hemodynamic alterations triggered by heart failure were found to be associated with the development of hypoxic hepatitis. Hypoxic hepatitis is a form of hepatic injury following acute arterial hypoxemia, hypoperfusion with consecutive ischemia, and passive congestion of the liver that significantly affects prognosis and the outcome of critically ill patients. It is tempting to speculate that preoperative determination of alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin levels can detect patients with early-stage hepatocardiac disorders who have a reduced hepatic tolerance to intra- and postoperative hemodynamic changes. Our laboratory findings support this hypothesis, as alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin are expected to be increased while transaminases are often normal or only slightly elevated in patients with cardiac hepatopathy as long as cardiac output is not severely compromised.

### I can feel it in my bones – a case of deranged' liver' function? [^e04544da]. BMJ Case Reports (2010). Medium credibility.

A 55-year-old Asian man was referred to a gastroenterology clinic by his general practitioner following an incidental finding of raised alkaline phosphatase (ALP) on routine blood testing. His ALP was found to be 198 (NR 35–129) with otherwise normal liver function tests. His past medical history consists of essential hypertension, type 2 diabetes and ischaemic heart disease. He was asymptomatic except for an intermittent ache over his left clavicle, which he had put down to angina. His gamma glutamyltransferase (GGT) was normal at 33 (NR 11–50) making bone the most likely source of his raised ALP. Imaging, including x-ray, CT and bone scan, showed an area of abnormality in the left clavicle. The appearances were consistent with fibrous dysplasia. We discuss the interpretation and investigation of deranged 'liver' function tests and suggest a rational and cost-effective diagnostic path to follow.

### Exosomal ALPPL2 and THBS2 as biomarkers for early detection and disease monitoring of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma [^dd4d47cc]. British Journal of Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

In recent years, exosomes, small membranous vesicles ranging from 30 to 150 nm in size, have emerged as a promising source of biomarkers for cancer. These vesicles contain molecular cargos, including proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids, from their cells of origin and are thought to be critical mediators of cell-to-cell communication. Importantly, cancer cells, including those from pancreatic tumors, secrete exosomes that carry unique pathogenic signatures distinct from those of normal cells. Exosomes derived from PDAC tumor tissues or cells have been shown to contain specific proteins and RNA molecules detectable in systemic circulation. These tumor-derived molecular cargos represent a valuable opportunity for developing non-invasive diagnostic tools for the early detection of PDAC. Investigators are actively exploring the profiling of exosomal content, including RNA signatures, proteomic patterns, and lipidomic profiles, to identify highly specific and sensitive markers for PDAC. As such, the study of exosome-based biomarkers represents a promising technique for the early detection of PDAC. Their potential to transform early detection strategies and improve outcomes for patients with this aggressive malignancy is a cause for optimism in the field of oncology and molecular diagnostics.

In our search for exosome-based protein markers for PDAC, we measured the levels of a panel of proteins in circulating exosomes isolated from serum samples of patients with pancreatic cancer. These proteins were previously reported to be overexpressed in pancreatic tumor tissues or cells. We found that two proteins, alkaline phosphatase, placental-like 2 (ALPPL2) and Thrombospondin 2 (THBS2), were highly elevated in serum exosomes isolated from patients with PDAC compared to those from healthy controls. ALPPL2, also known as alkaline phosphatase, germ cell type (ALPG), is a glycosyl phosphatidyl inositol (GPI)-anchored membrane protein that belongs to the alkaline phosphatase (ALP) isozyme family. ALPPL2 has been reported to be overexpressed in multiple tumor types such as mesothelioma, testicular, ovarian, gastric, and pancreatic cancer. THBS2 is a member of the calcium-associated glycoprotein family and is also overexpressed in multiple cancers including PDAC. Here, we report the utility of circulating exosome-based ALPPL2 and THBS2 as biomarkers for PDAC. We demonstrate that the concentrations of ALPPL2 + and THBS2 + exosomes are significantly elevated in the serum samples of patients with PDAC compared to healthy controls and to patients with non-cancerous conditions such as pancreatitis and cystic lesions. Changes in the concentrations of these marker positive exosomes significantly correlated with response (changes in tumor size) to treatment in patients with advanced PDAC.

Biochemistry

Serum alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) at presentation (while sometimes modestly raised, and occasionally normal) are typically about 10 times higher than normal (sometimes even higher). Serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) can be mildly raised in active disease, but marked elevation suggests primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) or primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) variant syndromes (Section N).

AIH presentation might vary between races. African-American patients are (compared with Caucasian patients) younger, with a higher prevalence of cirrhosis and liver failure. Non-Caucasian patients had more cholestatic histological features and a higher rate of non-response to treatment, not fully explained by differences in access to medical care.

Severity assessment

Although no unified severity classification exists for AIH, there are seven distinct patterns. These incorporate current understanding of acute and chronic liver disease and are determined by the severity of the acute (mild, icteric, severe, fulminant) and chronic (mild, fibrosis, and cirrhosis, compensated and decompensated) components of liver injury:

Asymptomatic disease: (a) mild or (b) with fibrosis/cirrhosis

Asymptomatic patients might not have mild disease. While they tend to have lower serum transaminases than symptomatic patients, severity of necro-inflammation and fibrosis are similar, as is death/transplantation rate. Treating asymptomatic patients is associated with improved survival (Section F).

Chronic hepatitis

This is the most common form of AIH, with insidious onset and non-specific symptoms.

Cirrhosis: (a) compensated and (b) decompensated

About one-third of patients with AIH have cirrhosis at diagnosis. Sometimes patients (usually elderly) present with cirrhosis complications. Cirrhosis and decompensation are poor prognostic features.

Acute hepatitis with or without jaundice

Initial severity of inflammation has prognostic implications. Patients with initial serum AST > 10 x ULN are less likely than those with values < 10 x ULN) to present with cirrhosis and/or decompensation, and to die due to (or need transplantation for) liver disease.

Acute on chronic liver failure (ACLF)

ACLF is acute injury developing in patients with (often unrecognised) cirrhosis, and sometimes with extrahepatic organ failure. In patients with AIH, a disease 'flare' might precipitate ACLF. Such patients might benefit from corticosteroids and most treated patients recover (Section F). However, in the UK, a label of ACLF is a potential mechanism to expedite liver transplant.

### Medical treatment of primary sclerosing cholangitis: what have we learned and where are we going? [^57de433a]. Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

THE PROS AND CONS OF ALP IN PSC

An elevated serum ALP level above the upper limit of normal (ULN) is part of the diagnostic criteria of PSC in adults in the EASL, but not in the AASLD clinical practice guidelines. According to the AASLD guidelines, the cholangiographic features of PSC, along with the exclusion of secondary sclerosing cholangitis, is sufficient for making a diagnosis, accounting for the fact that a significant proportion of individuals with PSC may have normal ALP levels. As PSC is increasingly diagnosed at earlier disease stages along with increased attention and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) availability and quality, omission of the elevated ALP criterion of the diagnosis, as now implemented in the AASLD guidelines, may be particularly relevant. High levels of ALP are associated with a more severe disease stratum, while normal levels are associated with a better prognosis. ALP is thus included in several prognostic models for PSC, including the Amsterdam-Oxford score, the UK-PSC score, and the PREsTO score. However, the intraindividual variability of ALP is considerable, and spontaneous normalization of ALP frequently occurs.,

Biology of ALP

ALPs are glycoproteins bound to the plasma membrane and are widely distributed in nature. In humans, zinc and magnesium serve as significant cofactors for their biological activity. ALPs exist in 4 different isoforms: intestinal ALP, placental ALP, germ cell ALP, and liver/bone/kidney (ie, tissue-nonspecific) ALP. Over 80% of the ALPs in serum originate from the liver and bone. Although ALPs are found in numerous tissues, their exact physiological function remains largely unknown. Elevated activity in the circulation is a marker for skeletal remodeling or hepatobiliary disease, but clinical variations in serum ALP levels also commonly occur in endocrine disorders such as thyroid disease, hematological diseases, malnutrition, and vitamin deficiencies. Genetic variation, for instance related to bile acid transport and glycobiology, associates with ALP levels in apparently healthy individuals. It is currently unknown to what extent ALP serves an integral part of cholestatic liver disease pathophysiology or merely represents a marker of biliary injury, altered bile composition, and cholestasis.

Cholestatic evaluation — biliary imaging and pregnancy testing: MRI/MRCP, endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography and/or endoscopic ultrasound can be ordered to better examine the bile duct morphology, pregnancy testing in women of childbearing age should be done to assess for intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, and a liver biopsy may be considered to assess for primary biliary cirrhosis or other infiltrative diseases; other infiltrative disorders may raise the alkaline phosphatase and cause intrahepatic cholestasis including sarcoidosis, atypical fungal infection, or malignancies.

### Association of intestinal alkaline phosphatase with necrotizing enterocolitis among premature infants [^6a2b84d9]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Unlike candidate biomarkers inclusive for all forms of systemic inflammation, can dysfunction in host management of microbiota have a high positive predictive value as a biomarker for necrotizing enterocolitis?

Findings

In this diagnostic study of 136 premature infants, high amounts of intestinal alkaline phosphatase protein in stool and low intestinal alkaline phosphatase enzyme activity were associated with diagnosis of necrotizing enterocolitis. There was no association of intestinal alkaline phosphatase measures with non–gastrointestinal tract infections.

Meaning

Measuring the inability of intestinal alkaline phosphatase to maintain host-microbiota homeostasis can potentially guide decisions for personalized care and treatment when an infant is most susceptible to developing necrotizing enterocolitis.

### Transient benign hyperphosphatasemia due to COVID-19: the first case report [^92b7a7aa]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) rapidly spread worldwide in a few months and was declared as a worldwide pandemic by WHO in March 2020. Transient benign hyperphosphatasemia (THI) is a benign condition associated with marked elevation of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) without any other kidney, bone, and liver pathologies.

Case Presentation

Herein, we report a previously healthy 16-month-old female patient who developed a secondary transient benign hyperphosphatasemia associated with SARS-CoV-2. Patient whole family's SARS-CoV-2 real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results were positive. Since THI is a diagnosis of exclusion, other reasons that may cause ALP elevation should be ruled out. ALP activity decreased and turned to normal ranges within the following month. THI has been reported to be in association with various conditions. Its relationship with many viruses has been reported previously.

Conclusions

If ALP elevation is detected in patients with COVID 19 due to the increasing number of infections, THI should be considered if there is no other accompanying pathology.

### Elevated alkaline phosphatase in infants with parenteral nutrition-associated liver disease reflects bone rather than liver disease [^72dcbfe0]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Elevated serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) in infants with intestinal failure (IF) can be due to parenteral nutrition-associated liver disease (PNALD) or metabolic bone disease (MBD). The purpose of the study was to determine the utility of serum ALP in the diagnostic criteria for PNALD by measuring tissue-specific levels in infants with IF and PNALD.

Methods

A retrospective review of patient data for 15 infants diagnosed with PNALD between December 2012 and August 2013 was performed. PNALD was defined as the presence of 2 consecutive direct bilirubin (DB) levels > 2 mg/dL. Fractionated serum alkaline phosphatase was measured in each patient, while the DB was > 2 mg/dL. Parathyroid hormone (PTH), vitamin D3, calcium, and phosphate levels were recorded where available.

Results

In 15 infants with PNALD, elevation in total ALP was due to marked elevations in bone-specific ALP. The median liver-specific ALP remained within the normal range. PTH, vitamin D3, calcium, and phosphate levels were within normal limits.

Conclusion

While elevated ALP can reflect biliary stasis, the ALP elevation observed in infants with IF and PNALD is predominantly of bone rather than hepatic origin. An elevated unfractionated ALP in infants with PNALD should therefore raise suspicion of underlying bone disease, rather than being attributed to liver disease alone.

### COVID-19 and liver injury: a meta-analysis [^1f310e05]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background/Aims

The number of cases with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has exceeded seven million worldwide. However, the data describing the global prevalence of liver injury associated with COVID-19 is lacking secondary to the novelty of this ongoing pandemic. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis to determine the association between COVID-19 and liver injury.

Methods

A systematic literature search of indexed databases including, PubMed, Medline, and Embase databases from inception to 14 April 2020, was used to identify studies that reported data of liver chemistry in patients diagnosed with COVID 19. The overall prevalence of abnormal liver chemistry and relevant 95% confidence interval was used to estimate the pooled results studies.

Results

Sixty-four studies with 11 245 patients with COVID-19 were included. The pattern of abnormal liver enzymes was notable for higher aspartate aminotransferase (AST) than alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels. The overall global prevalence of elevated AST, ALT, total bilirubin, gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), and alkaline phosphatase was 23.2, 21.2, 9.7, 15.0, and 4.0%, respectively. The prevalence of elevated AST was substantially higher among those with severe cases (45.5%) compared to non-severe cases (15.0%). Co-existing chronic liver disease presented up to 37.6% of patients with COVID-19.

Conclusion

A fourth of COVID-19 patients had elevated liver enzymes and associated with disease severity. Our study may be used as a guide for clinicians and epidemiologists to proactively identify other sources of injury and illness in patients diagnosed with COVID-19. Intensive monitoring for liver injury may be needed in cases with severe COVID-19.

### AASLD practice guidance on drug, herbal, and dietary supplement-induced liver injury [^6ff95011]. Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

Diagnostic approach to drug-induced liver injury (DILI) — DILI is largely a clinical diagnosis of exclusion, and initial laboratory testing includes aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and total and direct bilirubin, with serum albumin and international normalized ratio (INR) as severity markers. Clinically significant DILI is commonly defined as any one of the following: serum AST or ALT > 5× upper limit of normal (ULN) or ALP > 2× ULN (or pretreatment baseline if baseline is abnormal) on two separate occasions at least 24 h apart; total serum bilirubin > 2.5 mg/dl with elevated AST, ALT, or ALP; or INR > 1.5 with elevated AST, ALT, or ALP. Although DILI can present with lower abnormalities, up to 20% of individuals in the general population have mildly increased liver biochemistries due to NAFLD, alcohol, and other common conditions.

Table 5 (continued) — Ischemic liver injury and malignant infiltration clinical features and prognosis — Ischemic liver injury presents acutely, often in the setting of congestive heart failure, sepsis, traumatic injury, or major surgery, with a predominantly hepatocellular pattern and marked AST elevation > 10,000 IU/L; bilirubin and INR may worsen despite improving transaminases, and prognosis is favorable with restoration of hemodynamic stability. Malignant infiltration presents acutely, commonly from lymphoma, leukemia, breast cancer, or colon cancer, with abdominal pain, jaundice, hepatic encephalopathy, and hepatomegaly; labs show a mixed hepatocellular and cholestatic pattern with elevated alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyl transferase and marked transaminase elevation approximately 40× ULN; diagnosis often relies on liver or bone marrow biopsy, and prognosis is poor.

### Alkaline phosphatase normalization is associated with better prognosis in primary sclerosing cholangitis [^124a0da6]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Primary sclerosing cholangitis results in elevated but fluctuating serum alkaline phosphatase levels that occasionally return to normal.

Aims

To investigate the frequency of normalization of alkaline phosphatase in newly diagnosed primary sclerosing cholangitis patients and the subsequent clinical outcomes.

Methods

Records of newly diagnosed primary sclerosing cholangitis patients were examined retrospectively for laboratory values and clinical end points (cholangiocarcinoma, liver transplantation and death) within 10 years of diagnosis. Data from a recent prospective ursodeoxycholic acid treatment trial were also studied.

Results

Eighty-seven patients met the inclusion criteria. Normalization of alkaline phosphatase was seen in 35 (40%) patients. Five (14%) patients with normalization reached an end point whereas 17 (33%) of the patients with persistent elevation reached an end point (P = 0.02). Ursodeoxycholic acid was used similarly by both groups. When the investigative criteria were applied to a prospective trial, there was again a significant relationship between normalization of alkaline phosphatase and survival in patients receiving ursodeoxycholic acid (P < 0.01) and the placebo group (P = 0.02).

Conclusions

Serum alkaline phosphatase was found to normalize in a high proportion of newly diagnosed primary sclerosing cholangitis patients. This was significantly associated with a better prognosis in a retrospective cohort and when data from a prospective treatment trial was evaluated.

### Regulation of BMP-induced transcription in cultured human bone marrow stromal cells [^9928daac]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Adherent bone marrow stromal cells are inducible osteoprogenitors, giving rise to cells expressing osteoblast markers including alkaline phosphatase, osteopontin, osteocalcin, and bone sialoprotein. However, the potency of inducers varies in a species-specific manner. Glucocorticoids such as dexamethasone induce alkaline phosphatase activity in both human and rat mesenchymal stem cells, while mouse bone marrow stromal cells are refractory to dexamethasone-induced alkaline phosphatase activity. In contrast, BMP induces alkaline phosphatase activity in both mouse and rat bone marrow stromal cells, while BMP effects on human bone marrow stromal cells are poorly characterized.

Methods

Bone marrow samples were isolated from patients undergoing hip replacement. Mononuclear marrow cells were cultured and grown to confluence without or with 10⁻⁷ M dexamethasone. Cells from each isolate were passaged into medium containing 100 micro g/mL ascorbate phosphate and treated with dexamethasone, 100 ng/mL BMP, or no inducer. At day 6, alkaline phosphatase activity was assayed, and RNA was prepared for mRNA analyses by real-time polymerase chain reaction.

Results

Bone marrow stromal cells from twenty-four of twenty-six patients showed no significant osteogenic response to BMP-2, 4, or 7 as determined by alkaline phosphatase induction. However, BMPs induced elevated levels of other genes associated with osteogenesis such as bone sialoprotein and osteopontin as well as BMP-2 and noggin. If primary cultures of human bone marrow stromal cells were pretreated with dexamethasone, BMP-2 treatment of first-passage cells induced alkaline phosphatase in approximately half of the isolates, and significantly greater induction was seen in cells from males. Dexamethasone treatment, like BMP treatment, also increased expression of the BMP-binding protein noggin.

Conclusions

Most human femur bone marrow stromal cell samples appear incapable of expressing elevated alkaline phosphatase levels in response to BMPs. Since BMP treatment induced expression of several other BMP-regulated genes, the defect in alkaline phosphatase induction is presumably not due to impaired BMP signaling. We hypothesize that the mechanism by which BMPs modulate alkaline phosphatase expression is indirect, involving a BMP-regulated transcription factor for alkaline phosphatase expression that is controlled differently in humans and rodents.

### Alkaline phosphatase treatment of acute kidney injury-an update [^d0e60d0c]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

The endogenous enzyme ALP has an intricate connection with the host-response to systemic insults and with the preservation of natural barrier tissues. Despite promising in vivo results, clinical trials have yet to conclude if these effects translate to tangible improvement of patient health. Renewed insights into the interaction of exogenous ALP with TLRs and purinergic signalling, and its function in the protection of barrier tissues and the activity of endogenous ALP, can help guide new and ongoing trials.

### Pseudohypoparathyroidism: a rare but important cause of hypocalcaemia [^64e0de22]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

We present a 46-year-old Caucasian lady with symptomatic hypocalcaemia. Investigations revealed markedly raised parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels with vitamin D deficiency. A number of conditions causing secondary hyperparathyroidism were ruled out from her medical history and initial investigations. The main differential diagnoses were vitamin D deficiency and PTH resistance (pseudohypoparathyroidism, PHP). With high-normal serum phosphate and normal alkaline phosphatase, and a lack of symptoms associated with osteomalacia, vitamin D deficiency alone was unlikely to be the cause of hypocalcaemia. Given a normal physical appearance, genetic testing was arranged and confirmed the diagnosis of PHP type Ib. She is currently taking activated vitamin D to maintain calcium homeostasis. PTH resistance is the hallmark of PHP, a rare complex genetic disorder, which can be easily missed resulting in potentially serious consequences.

### Liver alkaline phosphatase: a missing link between choleresis and biliary inflammation [^ea262669]. Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

Several lines of evidence show that serum alkaline phosphatase (AP) is not only a signpost of cholestasis but also a surrogate marker of the severity of primary biliary cirrhosis and primary sclerosing cholangitis. In the present opinion article, we review and discuss the putative role of liver AP in health and in cholestatic diseases. In inflammatory cholestatic conditions, loss of activity of liver AP (resulting from its relocation from canaliculi and the acidic milieu) might promote hyper-adenosine triphosphate-bilia, lipopolysaccharide overload, and subsequent exacerbation and perpetuation of inflammation. Drugs that can restore the polarity of hepatocytes and canalicular export of bile acids or act as bile alkalinity modifiers are predicted to exert anti-inflammatory effects and to benefit both primary biliary cirrhosis and primary sclerosing cholangitis. Oral administration of intestinal AP could be a valid therapeutic intervention that deserves further study under experimental conditions as well as in human diseases. Overall, the key role of the liver microenvironment that might shape the different facets of the inflammatory processes in fibrosing cholangiopathies is highlighted.

### Genome-wide association study of serum liver enzymes implicates diverse metabolic and liver pathology [^0af3fc29]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Liver disease and its most serious complications of acute liver failure, cirrhosis, and liver cancer are leading and rising causes of mortality worldwide. Liver enzymes such as alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) are the most commonly-used laboratory indicators of liver disease and are increased in most common liver diseases. ALT and AST are traditionally considered markers of hepatocellular injury and ALP a marker of cholestasis. Liver enzyme elevations have been associated with greater liver-related mortality – and are used in clinical practice guidelines to direct treatment decisions in liver disease –. Beyond liver disease, the presence of elevated liver enzymes has been associated with increased all-cause mortality and risk of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes.

Liver enzymes are partially genetically-determined, with heritability estimated around 0.5 based on twin studies. Previously-published exome- or genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of genetic variants influencing liver enzyme concentrations identified loci in/near genes affecting bile acid transport, lipid/carbohydrate metabolism, glycobiology, and the immune system. A more detailed understanding of genetic risk factors for liver enzymes may identify further mechanisms and pathways to yield deeper insight into the biology of liver diseases as well as identify those at high risk due to their genome. However, the existing studies on this topic utilized relatively small cohorts.

We aimed to further characterize the genetic architecture of liver disease with a GWAS to identify loci associated with ALT, AST, or ALP, using two cohorts with in total almost ten times as many participants than those of previously-published liver enzyme GWAS. In this work, we identify 378 loci associated with ALT, AST, and/or ALP at genome-wide significance. These loci are implicated in diverse metabolic and liver-related pathology, and are expressed in a wide range of cell types within the liver.

### The natural history of main duct-involved, mixed-type intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm: parameters predictive of progression [^62a2a98e]. Annals of Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

As such, the natural history of MPD-involved IPMN is poorly understood.

Background

The high-risk of malignancy associated with main pancreatic duct (MPD)-involved intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) has been established by surgical series. The International Consensus Guidelines recommend surgical resection of MPD-involved IPMN in fit patients.

Methods

A review of a prospectively collected database (1992–2012) of patients with IPMN undergoing primary surveillance was performed. Invasive progression was defined as invasive carcinoma on pathology and/or positive cytopathology. Analyses included univariate, logistic regression, and receiver operating characteristic curve analyses.

Results

A total of 503 patients with IPMN underwent primary surveillance, 70 for MPD-involved, mixed-type IPMN. Indications for intensive surveillance of these 70 high-risk patients were comorbidities, patient choice, and early/borderline MPD dilation (42%, 51%, and 7%, respectively). Mean follow-up was 4.7 years. Nine patients (13%) progressed at a mean of 3.5 (range, 1–9) years during follow-up. Univariate analyses yielded weight loss, interval (from isolated branch-duct IPMN) to MPD involvement, diffuse MPD dilation, increase of MPD diameter, absence of extra pancreatic cysts, elevated serum CA19-9 levels, and elevated serum alkaline phosphatase levels as significant. Maximum MPD and/or branch-duct diameter were not significant. In logistic regression, diffuse MPD dilation, serum CA19-9 and serum alkaline phosphatase levels, and absence of extra pancreatic cysts were predictors of invasiveness. The receiver operating characteristic curve indicated that the combination of these 4 factors achieved an accuracy of 98% in predicting progression.

Conclusions

Primary surveillance of mixed-type IPMN may be a reasonable strategy in select patients. Diffuse MPD dilation, serum CA19-9, serum alkaline phosphatase, and absence of extrapancreatic cysts predict patients likely to progress during primary surveillance.

### Diagnosis and detection of sarcoidosis. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^3c389396]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Committee conclusions

The evidence suggests that liver laboratory abnormalities will be found in 12% of patients with sarcoidosis who undergo routine liver function testing, most of whom have hepatic granulomas. We did not identify a specific pattern of liver function abnormalities indicative of hepatic sarcoidosis, but some studies suggest that liver granulomas are more often associated with increases of alkaline phosphatase and less frequently with rises in transaminases.

The committee discussed reports that immune suppression and ursodeoxycholic acid reduce transaminitis and cholestasis in patients with related symptoms (pruritus), suggesting that treatment is effective in reducing disease activity in patients with symptomatic hepatic sarcoidosis. However, according to both the committee's clinical experience and the systematic review, it is uncertain whether these effects can be extrapolated to asymptomatic patients with hepatic sarcoidosis. The systematic review found no difference in resolution or improvement of abnormal liver function tests with treatment; however, it was not designed to estimate the effects of treatment of hepatic sarcoidosis, and, therefore, better evidence about treatment may exist. Treatment decisions should not be undertaken carelessly, because death due to cirrhosis or liver failure is uncommon, yet the risks of chronic treatment, especially immune suppression, are significant. The committee also noted that prednisone treatment may confound the assessment, as it can cause transaminitis. The committee agreed that the evidence is too scarce to conclude whether treatment affects progression to cirrhosis or reduces the need for liver transplantation.

Taken together, the evidence suggests that more than 1 out of every 10 patients with sarcoidosis who undergo liver function testing will be identified as having liver involvement, but the implication on treatment is unclear. The committee concluded that there is value in identifying patients with liver involvement at the time of initial diagnosis, and to screen for liver involvement annually even if the initial screen is negative (Table 5), if for no other reason than to avoid hepatotoxic treatments, and to follow such patients more carefully for the development of symptoms that warrant treatment.

Recommendations

1 For patients with sarcoidosis who have neither hepatic symptoms nor established hepatic sarcoidosis, we suggest baseline serum alkaline phosphatase testing to screen for hepatic sarcoidosis (conditional recommendation, very low-quality evidence).
2 For patients with sarcoidosis who have neither hepatic symptoms nor established hepatic sarcoidosis, we make no recommendation for or against baseline serum transaminase testing.

### Tumour-derived alkaline phosphatase regulates tumour growth, epithelial plasticity and disease-free survival in metastatic prostate cancer [^2b031a6e]. British Journal of Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer in men, with an estimated 1.1 million men diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2012 worldwide. Whereas localised prostate cancer has a good prognosis, advanced disease metastasises frequently to the skeleton, and becomes castration resistant. Once prostate cancer has metastasised to distant sites, the disease is ultimately fatal and treatment is purely palliative. The most common metastatic sites are the lymph nodes and the bone, with bone metastases resulting in severe bone pain and fractures. Despite many advances in research, a greater understanding of the metastatic process is required, to identify new therapeutic targets.

Recent evidence suggests that bone-related parameters are the main prognostic factors for overall survival in advanced prostate cancer. These include alkaline phosphatase, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, urinary n -telopepetide, previous skeletal-related events and pain. Alkaline phosphatase, also known as tissue nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP) or mesenchymal stem cell antigen 1, is an enzyme that is expressed by a range of tissues including bone, and also the liver. There are four existing isoforms of alkaline phosphatase, and the ALPL gene encodes for TNAP. Alkaline phosphatase is highly expressed by osteoblasts and a key component of osteoblastic activity, acting to hydrolyse inorganic pyrophosphate resulting in mineralisation. The bone lesions associated with prostate cancer are predominantly osteosclerotic, arising because of an increase in osteoblastic activity and uncontrolled formation of new bone. As such, the elevated circulating levels of alkaline phosphatase seen in advanced prostate cancer are thought to reflect the dysregulated bone formation associated with cancer-induced bone disease.

### Transient rise in alkaline phosphatase activity in adults [^a9acd0be]. BMJ Case Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Benign transient hyperphosphatasia (BTH) is a condition that occurs mainly in infants and children and is characterised by a transient increase of serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity up to several fold the adult upper reference limit (URL). The present report concerns BTH in 2 patients, aged 59 and 52 years old, who showed no evidence of bone or liver disease but had an increase in ALP activity up to 20-fold and 13-fold the adult URL, respectively. The diagnosis of BTH in the first case was made retrospectively, and after excluding liver and bone disease. However, in the second case the diagnosis was made early in the course of the disease, by performing an ALP isoenzyme electrophoresis test. Lengthy and extensive investigations were avoided in the second case. These cases highlight the occurrence of this condition in adulthood as well as in infancy and childhood.

### Diagnosing autoimmune hepatitis in children: is the international autoimmune hepatitis group scoring system useful? [^e468cbd6]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2004). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

In 1999, the International Autoimmune Hepatitis Group (IAIHG) modified a scoring system to differentiate adult patients with definite or probable autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) from those with other forms of chronic liver disease. We assessed the use of the scoring system in children.

Methods

Twenty-eight pediatric patients with AIH and/or sclerosing cholangitis were reviewed. Clinical, laboratory, and histologic data were collected to score patients both before and after standard treatment.

Results

There were 8 boys and 20 girls. The median age at diagnosis was 11 years (range, 2–16 years). Twenty-one of 28 children were diagnosed with AIH, 4 as isolated primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), and 3 as overlap syndrome. At presentation, 18 of 21 (86%) with AIH scored as definite AIH and 3 of 21 (14%) scored as probable. No patient clinically diagnosed as AIH scored as other. Seven of 28 patients had proven PSC. All patients with isolated PSC scored as other. The 3 with overlap syndrome scored as definite AIH. When the gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (GGT) ratio was substituted for the alkaline phosphatase (ALP) ratio, 5 patients were reclassified from definite to probable AIH. Four of these 5 had an incomplete response to therapy, and 2 of 4 have confirmed overlap syndrome.

Conclusions

The IAIHG scoring system has a use in children. Patients who fall into the other category should have cholangiographic imaging. Using the GGT ratio instead of the ALP ratio in the IAIHG score may improve the specificity for children, identifying those likely to have biliary disease. When GGT is used, patients classified as needing probable pretreatment should be considered for biliary imaging.

### Fezolinetant (Veozah) [^108ee777]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.1 Hepatotoxicity

In three clinical trials, elevations in serum transaminase [alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and/or aspartate aminotransferase (AST)] levels > 3 x the upper limit of normal (ULN) occurred in 2.3% [exposure adjusted incidence rate (EAIR) of 2.7 per 100 person-years] of women receiving VEOZAH and 0.9% (EAIR of 1.5 per 100 person-years) of women receiving placebo. No elevations in serum total bilirubin (> 2 x ULN) occurred. Women with ALT or AST elevations were generally asymptomatic. Transaminase levels returned to pretreatment levels (or close to these) without sequelae with dose continuation, and upon dose interruption, or discontinuation. Women with cirrhosis were not studied [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

In the postmarketing setting, cases of drug-induced liver injury with elevations of ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and total bilirubin occurred within 40 days of starting VEOZAH. Patients reported a general sense of feeling unwell and symptoms of fatigue, nausea, pruritus, jaundice, pale feces, and dark urine. The patients' signs and symptoms gradually resolved after discontinuation of VEOZAH [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

Perform baseline hepatic laboratory tests to evaluate for hepatic function and injury [including serum ALT, serum AST, serum ALP, and serum bilirubin (total and direct)] prior to VEOZAH initiation. Do not start VEOZAH if ALT or AST is ≥ 2 x ULN or if the total bilirubin is ≥ 2 x ULN for the evaluating laboratory.

Perform follow-up hepatic laboratory tests monthly for the first 3 months, at 6 months, and 9 months after initiation of therapy.

Advise patients to discontinue VEOZAH immediately and seek medical attention including hepatic laboratory tests if they experience signs or symptoms that may suggest liver injury:

new onset fatigue, decreased appetite, nausea, vomiting, pruritus, jaundice, pale feces, dark urine, or abdominal pain.

Discontinue VEOZAH if:

transaminase elevations are > 5 x ULN.
transaminase elevations are > 3 x ULN and total bilirubin is > 2 x ULN.

If transaminase elevations > 3 x ULN occur, perform more frequent follow-up hepatic laboratory tests until resolution.

Exclude alternative causes of hepatic laboratory test elevations.

### Bone turnover markers: basic biology to clinical applications [^ba09017f]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

BTMs are high in osteomalacia, whatever the cause. High ALP is classically associated with osteomalacia, but high CTX, PINP, uNTX, and OC are also observed. Osteomalacia healing is also associated with increase in BTMs due to accelerated bone mineralization followed by normalization.

Paget's disease

Paget's disease is the second most common metabolic bone disorder after osteoporosis. It is characterized by increased bone activity (increased bone resorption by abnormal osteoclasts followed by disorganized bone formation) and can be monostotic or polyostotic. It most commonly affects men after the age of 40 and the bones usually affected are the femora, spine, skull, sternum, and pelvis. The pathogenesis of the disease involves abnormal bone turnover and so BTMs have been used for the diagnosis, with the most common one being ALP. Bisphosphonates have been used for the management of symptomatic patients with Paget's disease, with 61.7% showing improvement of their bone pain. As a result, BTMs have also been used in the monitoring of the treatment response.

Vitamin D–deficiency rickets — radiographic features and laboratory profile with illustrative treatment response are described as follows: radiographs show metaphyseal widening, splaying, cupping, and fraying with a coarse trabecular metaphyseal pattern; the earliest rachitic change is loss of demarcation between metaphysis and growth plate with loss of the provisional zone of calcification; a 10-point radiographic scoring system was developed to assess severity based on knee and wrist findings; laboratory findings include hypophosphatemia, varying degrees of hypocalcemia, increased alkaline phosphatase and increased PTH, with low 25(OH)-D confirming diagnosis and 1,25(OH)2-D potentially elevated as PTH rises; Table 1 summarizes laboratory findings in the 3 stages of vitamin D–deficiency rickets; an example case shows near-complete radiographic healing 3 months after vitamin D and calcium therapy in a 1-year old.

### Alkaline phosphatase treatment of acute kidney injury-an update [^29b58ee4]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

Through improved insights into the increasing incidence and detrimental effects of acute kidney injury (AKI), its clinical relevance has become more and more apparent. Although treatment strategies for AKI have also somewhat improved, an adequate remedy still does not exist. Finding one is complicated by a multifactorial pathophysiology and by heterogeneity in the patient population. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) has been suggested as a therapy for sepsis-associated AKI because of its protective effects against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation and kidney injury in animals. However, its effectiveness as an AKI treatment has not been demonstrated definitively. Because the anti-inflammatory properties of ALP are likely not reliant on a direct effect on LPS itself, we postulate that other pathways are much more important in explaining the renoprotective properties ascribed to ALP. The re-evaluation of which properties of the ALP enzyme are responsible for the benefit seen in the lab is an important step in determining where the true potential of ALP as a treatment strategy for AKI in the clinic lies. In this review we will discuss how ALP can prevent activation of harmful pro-inflammatory receptors, redirect cell-cell signalling and protect barrier tissues, which together form the basis for current knowledge of the role of ALP in the kidney. With this knowledge in mind and by analysing currently available clinical evidence, we propose directions for new research that can determine whether ALP as a treatment strategy for AKI has a future in the clinical field.

### Resmetirom therapy for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease: October 2024 updates to AASLD practice guidance [^d4c53859]. Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

AASLD MASLD guidance — liver safety during resmetirom: "Regular hepatic function panel testing during resmetirom therapy is recommended to screen for hepatotoxicity". "Resmetirom should be discontinued if clinically significant hepatotoxicity develops as defined per the AASLD drug-induced liver injury practice guidance, specifically: AST or ALT greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal or alkaline phosphatase greater than 2 times the upper limit of normal (or pretreatment baseline if baseline is abnormal) on 2 occasions; or total serum bilirubin greater than 2.5 mg/dL plus elevated AST, ALT, or alkaline phosphatase; or INR greater than 1.5 plus elevated AST, ALT, or alkaline phosphatase".

### ACG clinical guideline: focal liver lesions [^485e9660]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Inflammatory adenomas characteristics — Inflammatory adenomas (I-HCAs) account for up to 44% of cases, and laboratory changes can include elevations in serum alkaline phosphatase or elevated systemic inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein and fibrinogen levels, although presently, there is insufficient evidence to support routinely checking CRP or fibrinogen in these cases. Risk factors for development of I-HCAs include obesity, metabolic syndrome, heavy alcohol consumption, and glycogen storage disease, they can be prone to hemorrhage, and the risk of malignant transformation is low unless there is concomitant presence of the β-catenin mutation.
