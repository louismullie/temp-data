## Question

What is the mechanism by which tranexamic acid works?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how tranexamic acid works, specifically its mechanism of action. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the molecular nature of tranexamic acid and why its lysine-analogue structure matters. Then, I should verify its primary binding targets and affinities within the fibrinolytic system. Next, I will delineate the principal competitive mechanism at the fibrin surface, followed by secondary mechanisms involving tPA and plasmin. After that, I need to translate these molecular effects into physiological and clinical outcomes, including specificity and pharmacodynamics. Finally, I must consider timing effects, especially the evidence for early administration, potential loss of benefit with delay, and then synthesize a concise mechanistic summary that aligns with guidelines and large trials.

> Let me first confirm the molecular identity and relevance. Tranexamic acid (TXA) is a synthetic lysine analogue; that structural mimicry is key because lysine-binding interactions govern plasminogen engagement with fibrin and other components of the fibrinolytic system, which TXA exploits to block fibrin clot breakdown [^111mB93D] [^115bZewv].

> I will now examine the specific binding sites and affinities to ensure accuracy. Plasminogen contains multiple lysine-binding kringle domains, including one high-affinity site with a dissociation constant around 1.1 micromol/L and several low-affinity sites with dissociation constants around 750 micromol/L, and TXA binds reversibly to these sites to disrupt fibrin-associated interactions, which is central to its antifibrinolytic effect [^111mB93D].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should confirm the primary mechanism at the clot interface. The high-affinity lysine-binding site on plasminogen mediates its docking to fibrin, and TXA saturates this site to competitively displace plasminogen from the fibrin surface, thereby preventing its localization and subsequent activation to plasmin where fibrinolysis would otherwise occur [^111mB93D].

> Next, I should review secondary inhibitory mechanisms, but I need to be cautious about overstatement. By blocking plasminogen–fibrin interactions, TXA also inhibits tPA-catalyzed plasmin generation at the clot surface, and by binding lysine-recognition elements on plasmin it may reduce plasmin accumulation on fibrin, though the clinical significance of direct plasmin inhibition by TXA appears limited and context dependent; structural enzymology suggests only weak direct plasmin inhibition by TXA-like moieties, so I should avoid implying a potent active-site effect for TXA itself [^1137vyGB] [^112aY922].

> Let me translate these molecular actions into physiological outcomes. By reducing plasmin generation at the fibrin interface and limiting plasmin–fibrin engagement, TXA preserves the hemostatic fibrin matrix and stabilizes existing clots, which mechanistically explains its consistent ability to reduce bleeding across many surgical and acute bleeding settings without directly enhancing coagulation factor activity or platelet function per se [^111mB93D] [^115bZewv].

> Wait, let me verify the pharmacodynamic and "specificity" claims so I do not misstate anything. Initially, I might say TXA does not significantly affect platelet count, global coagulation time, or coagulation factors up to 10 mg/mL; however, the label actually notes that at 1–10 mg/mL TXA can prolong thrombin time, so I should correct that and state that while platelet counts and most coagulation factors are not materially altered, thrombin time may be prolonged at higher concentrations, with antifibrinolytic concentrations persisting about 17 hours in tissues and up to 7–8 hours in serum, which supports sustained local effect despite relatively shorter serum persistence [^111mB93D].

> I should double-check how timing connects the mechanism to outcomes in clinical contexts. Early administration is crucial in trauma and postpartum hemorrhage, with multiple analyses showing the greatest benefit when given within 3 hours, aligning with the idea that timely blockade of plasminogen recruitment to fibrin prevents the escalation of fibrinolysis; major guidelines and meta-analyses endorse prompt dosing in bleeding trauma and PPH, typically 1 g IV over 10 minutes followed by 1 g over 8 hours in trauma and 1 g IV with a second 1 g if bleeding persists in PPH, reflecting a pharmacologic strategy to saturate binding sites early during active fibrinolysis [^112QkdTC] [^114Pc711] [^115kTKre] [^116MQfLD].

> But wait, what if treatment is delayed or the biology shifts; I need to ensure I capture that nuance. Experimental and translational work suggests that delayed TXA in the face of rising urokinase activity and depletion of α2-antiplasmin may paradoxically facilitate plasmin generation in plasma and propagate coagulopathy, offering a plausible mechanistic explanation for the loss of benefit or potential harm when TXA is given late; context-specific data, such as in acute gastrointestinal bleeding with high-dose, prolonged infusions, show no mortality benefit and a signal for increased venous thromboembolism, underscoring that TXA's mechanistic advantages are setting, dose, and timing dependent [^114ftKFN] [^115dxeuT] [^1127EbmD].

> Let me synthesize and ensure internal consistency. TXA, a lysine analogue, reversibly occupies lysine-binding kringle domains on plasminogen, saturating the high-affinity fibrin-binding site to competitively displace plasminogen from fibrin; as a result, local plasmin generation by tPA at the clot surface is curtailed and plasmin–fibrin engagement is reduced, preserving the fibrin matrix and reducing bleeding, with minimal direct effects on platelets and coagulation factors though thrombin time may be prolonged at higher concentrations; clinically, early administration leverages this mechanism to confer benefit in trauma and PPH, whereas delayed or context-mismatched use may attenuate efficacy or introduce risk, consistent with mechanistic expectations and large trial data [^111mB93D] [^115bZewv] [^112QkdTC] [^1127EbmD] [^116MQfLD].

Tranexamic acid is a synthetic lysine analogue that exerts its antifibrinolytic effect by **competitively binding to lysine sites on plasminogen** [^112aY922], thereby **preventing plasminogen from binding to fibrin** and inhibiting its activation to plasmin [^111mB93D]. This preserves the fibrin matrix and stabilizes clots, reducing bleeding without directly affecting coagulation factors or platelets [^115bZewv]. The antifibrinolytic effect is **dose-dependent and reversible**, with therapeutic concentrations maintained in tissues for about 17 hours and in serum for 7–8 hours [^111mB93D]. TXA does not directly inhibit active plasmin [^112csfm2], so delayed administration (> 3 hours) can be less effective or harmful due to ongoing fibrinolysis [^114ftKFN] and α2-antiplasmin depletion [^1137vyGB].

---

## Molecular mechanism of action

Tranexamic acid is a synthetic lysine derivative that **competitively binds lysine-binding sites on plasminogen** [^111mB93D], preventing plasminogen from binding to fibrin and its activation to plasmin, the enzyme responsible for fibrin degradation [^112aY922]. By blocking plasminogen-fibrin interactions, TXA stabilizes the fibrin matrix and prevents clot dissolution [^112WzGz9].

---

## Pharmacodynamics

TXA's antifibrinolytic effect is **dose-dependent and reversible** [^111mB93D] [^115bZewv]. At 1 and 10 mg/mL, TXA prolongs thrombin time [^111mB93D], indicating inhibition of fibrinolysis. Therapeutic concentrations persist in tissues for approximately 17 hours and in serum for 7–8 hours [^111mB93D]. It does not significantly affect platelet count, coagulation time, or coagulation factors at concentrations up to 10 mg/mL [^111mB93D].

---

## Clinical implications

TXA is widely used to reduce bleeding in trauma [^112QkdTC], surgery [^116c2V6t], and obstetric hemorrhage [^111L9oMy], and its efficacy depends on **early administration** — typically within 3 hours of bleeding onset [^114Pc711] — to maximize antifibrinolytic effects and minimize complications. Conversely, delayed administration (> 3 hours) may be less effective or harmful due to ongoing fibrinolysis [^114ftKFN] and depletion of α2-antiplasmin, a natural plasmin inhibitor [^1137vyGB].

---

## Safety considerations

TXA is generally safe, but high doses or prolonged use can increase the **risk of seizures** [^114SbALE], especially in patients with renal impairment or neurological disorders [^111sGU2U]. It may also cause visual disturbances [^111sGU2U], hypersensitivity reactions, and, rarely, thromboembolic events [^112r4Dqb].

Tranexamic acid is a synthetic lysine analogue that **competitively inhibits plasminogen activation** [^111mB93D], stabilizing fibrin clots and reducing bleeding [^116c2V6t]. Its antifibrinolytic effect is dose-dependent and reversible, with therapeutic concentrations maintained in tissues and serum for several hours [^111mB93D].

### Cyklokapron [^111mB93D]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Mechanism of action**: Tranexamic acid is a synthetic lysine amino acid derivative that diminishes the dissolution of hemostatic fibrin by plasmin. In the presence of tranexamic acid, the lysine receptor binding sites of plasmin for fibrin are occupied, which prevents binding to fibrin monomers and preserves and stabilizes fibrin's matrix structure.

	- The antifibrinolytic effects of tranexamic acid are mediated by reversible interactions at multiple binding sites within plasminogen. Native human plasminogen contains four to five lysine binding sites with low affinity for tranexamic acid (Kd = 750 μmol/L) and one with high affinity (Kd = 1.1 μmol/L). The high-affinity lysine site of plasminogen is involved in its binding to fibrin. Saturation of the high-affinity binding site with tranexamic acid displaces plasminogen from the surface of fibrin. Although plasmin may be formed by conformational changes in plasminogen, binding to and dissolution of the fibrin matrix is inhibited.

- **Pharmacodynamics**: Tranexamic acid, at concentrations of 1 mg/mL and 10 mg/mL, prolongs the thrombin time. An antifibrinolytic concentration of tranexamic acid remains in different tissues for about 17 hours and in the serum for up to 7 or 8 hours.

	- Tranexamic acid in concentrations up to 10 mg/mL in blood has no influence on the platelet count, the coagulation time, or various coagulation factors in whole blood or citrated blood from healthy subjects.

### Increased urokinase and consumption of α-antiplasmin as an explanation for the loss of benefit of tranexamic acid after treatment delay [^114ftKFN]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2019). Low credibility.

We hypothesize that uPA and α 2 ‐antiplasmin are key factors in the mechanism accounting for the loss of efficacy of TXA in controlling bleeding after treatment delay. Hemorrhage associated with trauma, childbirth, and surgical interventions will lead to the activation of clotting and fibrinolysis and the generation of tPA and uPA, and subsequently plasmin. Importantly, ongoing fibrinolysis causes depletion of α 2‐antiplasmin. Application of TXA is very effective at protecting fibrin, but TXA can stimulate plasminogen activation by uPA and protect plasmin in circulation from α 2‐antiplasmin.

Free plasmin can induce coagulopathy by proteolyzing coagulation factors, including fibrinogen, FV, FVIII, and FXIII, and can damage the blood–brain barrier. At the stage where there is overt hyperfibrinolysis, direct inhibition of plasmin by exogenous inhibitors may be necessary. However, more information is needed on the time‐course and magnitude of uPA production in trauma patients, particularly the minority that develop life‐threatening hyperfibrinolysis.

### The current place of aprotinin in the management of bleeding [^112csfm2]. Anaesthesia (2015). Low credibility.

There is a considerable difference between the mechanism of action of the lysine analogues, tranexamic acid and epsilon-aminocaproic acid, and the serine protease inhibitor aprotinin. Aprotinin acts to inactivate free plasmin, with little effect on bound plasmin, whereas the lysine analogues are designed to prevent excessive plasmin formation by fitting into plasminogen's lysine-binding site to prevent the binding of plasminogen to fibrin. Aprotinin is associated with a reduction in bleeding and transfusion requirements following major surgery and has a dose-response profile, compared with no dose-response effect in the one study investigating tranexamic acid in cardiac surgical patients. Following its withdrawal in 2007, which is explained in detail in this review, the regulators have now licensed aprotinin for myocardial revascularisation only, which is relatively low-risk for bleeding.

### The utility and safety of prophylactic tranexamic acid in tonsillectomy: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111tjKyP]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). Low credibility.

An important question that wasn't specifically addressed and answered in this systematic review is whether TXA impacts primary or secondary hemorrhage. From a basic pharmacology standpoint, TXA is a synthetic analogue to the amino acid lysine. It promotes antifibrinolysis by competitively binding to the lysine‐binding site on plasmin and plasminogen and precludes subsequent fibrin clot degradation by plasmin. It seems reasonable then to believe that TXA impacts mainly primary PTH by the preservation of fibrin clot and prevention of its early degradation. We hypothesize, however, that TXA may also reduce secondary PTH by reducing perioperative bleeding and oozing. The proposed pathophysiological mechanism of action is illustrated in Figure 11. This hypothesis remains to be verified in future works.

### The role of tranexamic acid (TXA) on postoperative bleeding in bariatric surgery: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115QZ8Ac]. Obesity Surgery (2025). Low credibility.

Recent research highlights TXA's potential in managing postoperative bleeding in bariatric surgery, prompting us to evaluate its effectiveness for treatment and prophylaxis. PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Central, SciElo, and LILACS were searched for TXA studies in bariatric surgery, excluding those without control groups or with overlapping populations. Outcome analysis focused on postoperative bleeding, length of hospital stay (LOS), TXA side effects, mortality, transfusion needs, and thromboembolic complications. From 93 results, six studies involving 1,121 patients were included.

TXA use significantly decreased the LOS (MD = -0.12; 95% CI, -0.18, -0.06; p < 0.01), operative time (MD = -5.77; 95% CI, -9.98, -1.56; p < 0.01), and postoperative bleeding (OR = 0.57; 95% CI, 0.34, 0.98; p = 0.043). However, TXA did not affect the rate of hematoma formation (OR = 0.39; 95% CI, 0.07, 2.29; p = 0.299), rate of reoperation (OR = 0.46; 95% CI, 0.08, 2.82; p = 0.403), or need for transfusion (OR = 0.25; 95% CI, 0.06, 1.07; p = 0.062). There were no thromboembolic events or mortality. TXA significantly reduces LOS, operative time, and postoperative bleeding in bariatric surgery without affecting reoperation rates. This medication appears to be safe in this population as it did not increase the risk of thromboembolic events.

### Tranexamic acid in neurosurgery: A controversy indication-review [^117GpsSr]. Neurosurgical Review (2021). Low credibility.

Tranexamic acid (TXA) is one of the measures indicated to reduce bleeding and the need for volume replacement; however, data on risks and benefits are controversial. This study analyzes the effectiveness and risks of using tranexamic acid in neurosurgery. Articles published from 1976 to 2019 were selected from PubMed, EMBASE, Science Direct, and The Cochrane Database using the descriptors: "tranexamic acid", "neurosurgery", "traumatic brain injury", "subdural hemorrhage", "brain aneurysm", and "subarachnoid hemorrhage".

TXA can reduce blood loss and the need for blood transfusions in trauma and spinal surgery. Despite the benefits of TXA, moderate-to-high doses are potentially associated with neurological complications such as seizures, transient ischemic attack, and delirium in adults and children. In cases of ruptured intracranial aneurysm, the use of TXA can considerably reduce the risk of rebleeding; however, there is weak evidence regarding its influence on mortality reduction. The use of TXA in brain surgery does not present a benefit, but this conclusion is limited by the scarcity of studies.

TXA in neurosurgeries is a promising method for maintaining hemostasis in affected patients, mainly in traumatic brain injury and spinal surgery; however, there is a lack of evidence in brain and vascular surgeries. Many questions remain unanswered, such as determining the dosage that triggers associated complications or adjusting the dose for patients with chronic kidney disease.

### Effect of tranexamic acid by baseline risk of death in acute bleeding patients: a meta-analysis of individual patient-level data from 28 333 patients [^114jDYKY]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2020). Low credibility.

- **Editor's key points**:
	- This meta-analysis investigated how the effectiveness and safety of tranexamic acid varies by the baseline risk of death as a result of acute bleeding.
	- The study shows that many deaths from bleeding are in patients at low or intermediate risk.
	- The effectiveness of tranexamic acid seems not to vary by the baseline risk of patients.
	- Tranexamic acid should therefore not be limited to the most severely injured or bleeding patients.

The Anti-Fibrinolytic Trials Collaboration previously published a meta-analysis of individual patient data showing that early administration of tranexamic acid safely reduces death from acute severe bleeding. When given soon after bleeding onset, tranexamic acid reduces the relative risk of death as a result of bleeding by about one-third. Early tranexamic acid treatment is widely recommended in treatment guidelines for acute severe bleeding, including postpartum haemorrhage and major trauma.

Many guidelines, especially those for trauma, focus on the use of tranexamic acid in severely injured patients with a high risk of death from bleeding. Although these patients have much to gain from tranexamic acid treatment, they are few in number and many die at the scene. Because there are many more patients with less severe injuries and a lower risk of death from bleeding, if tranexamic acid was similarly effective, prompt treatment of these patients could prevent many deaths. We examined how the effectiveness and safety of antifibrinolytic drugs vary by the baseline risk of death as a result of bleeding.

### Prophylactic tranexamic acid in patients with hematologic malignancy: a placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial [^113ie8n7]. Blood (2022). High credibility.

The antifibrinolytic agent tranexamic acid (TXA) is often used to prevent bleeding in patients with hemorrhagic disorders or platelet dysfunction, and there has been speculation that it might prevent bleeding in patients with thrombocytopenia. Gernsheimer and colleagues report on a randomized double-blind study of TXA versus placebo for patients with hematologic malignancy and treatment-related thrombocytopenia. The authors confirm that TXA does not significantly reduce the risk of WHO grade 2 or higher bleeding, nor does it decrease the need for platelet transfusions.

### Tranexamic acid use in the surgical arena: A narrative review [^117JgdaJ]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2024). Low credibility.

Tranexamic acid (TXA) is a potent antifibrinolytic drug that inhibits the activation of plasmin by plasminogen. While not a new medication, TXA has quickly gained traction across a variety of surgical subspecialties to prevent and treat bleeding. Knowledge of the use of this drug is essential for the modern surgeon to continue to provide excellent care to their patients.

- **Methods**: A comprehensive review of the PubMed database was conducted on articles published within the last 10 years (2014–2024) relating to TXA and its use in various surgical subspecialties. Seminal studies regarding the use of TXA older than 10 years were included from the author's archives.

- **Results**: Indications for TXA are not limited to trauma alone, and TXA is utilized across a variety of surgical subspecialties from neurosurgery to hepatic surgery to control hemorrhage. Overall, TXA is well tolerated with common dose-dependent adverse effects, including headache, nasal symptoms, dizziness, nausea, diarrhea, and fatigue. More severe adverse events are rare and easily mitigated by not exceeding a dose of 50 mg/kg.

- **Conclusions**: The administration of TXA as an adjunct to treat trauma saves lives. The ability of TXA to induce seizures is dose-dependent with identifiable risk factors, making this serious adverse effect predictable. As for the potential for TXA to cause thrombotic events, uncertainty remains. If this association is proven to be real, the risk will likely be small, since the use of TXA is still advantageous in most situations because of its efficacy for a more common concern, bleeding.

### A single preoperative dose of tranexamic acid reduces perioperative blood loss: a meta-analysis [^116c2V6t]. Annals of Surgery (2021). High credibility.

To review the efficacy and safety of a single dose of intravenous tranexamic acid (TXA) given preoperatively, TXA is a synthetic antifibrinolytic used in various surgical disciplines to reduce blood loss, blood transfusions, ecchymosis, and hematoma formation. However, there is no universal standard on the most effective dose and route of TXA administration, which limits its routine use in many centers. This study evaluates the evidence for the efficacy and safety of a single preoperative dose of TXA on surgical blood loss in all surgical disciplines.

With the guidance of a research librarian, and in accordance with the Cochrane Handbook, Medline, Cochrane Central, and Embase were searched in November 2018. Search terms included "Tranexamic Acid" AND "Intravenous", with studies limited to randomized controlled trials in adult humans. Two independent reviewers and an arbitrator assessed articles for inclusion. Criteria included a single preoperative bolus dose of intravenous TXA, surgical patients, and intraoperative blood loss measurement or perioperative blood loss up to 24 hours post-surgery. Quality assessment was done using the Cochrane Collaboration risk-of-bias tool by two reviewers. Statistical analysis was carried out using Cochrane Review Manager 5.3. The primary outcome was surgical blood loss. Secondary outcomes included venous thromboembolic complications, transfusion requirements, and dosing.

A total of 1,906 articles were screened, and 57 met the inclusion criteria. The majority of included studies were of good quality.

### Tranexamic acid for upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^111seujY]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Tranexamic acid reduces hemorrhage through its antifibrinolytic effects. In a previous version of this review, tranexamic acid was found to potentially reduce mortality. This current review includes updated searches of randomized trials on tranexamic acid versus placebo, cimetidine, or lansoprazole.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of tranexamic acid for upper gastrointestinal bleeding.

- **Search methods**: Electronic searches using The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Science Citation Index were combined with manual searches. The last search update was in October 2011.

- **Selection criteria**: Trials in which patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding were randomized to receive either tranexamic acid, placebo, or any anti-ulcer drug were included.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors independently extracted data. All-cause mortality was the primary outcome measure. Random-effects model meta-analyses were performed, and results were presented as relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Subgroup, sensitivity, regression, and sequential analyses were performed to analyze sources of intertrial heterogeneity and the robustness of the overall result.

- **Main results**: Seven double-blind randomized trials on tranexamic acid versus placebo, cimetidine, or lansoprazole were included. One trial offered endoscopic treatment to all randomized patients. Random-effects model meta-analysis found that tranexamic acid reduced mortality compared with placebo (41 of 829 versus 68 of 825 patients; RR: 0.61, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.89). The beneficial effect was not confirmed fully.

### The never ending success story of tranexamic acid in acquired bleeding [^115bZewv]. Haematologica (2020). High credibility.

Tranexamic acid (TXA) is an anti-fibrinolytic agent that acts by inhibiting plasminogen activation and fibrinolysis. Although its first clinical use dates back more than 50 years, this hemostatic agent is still the object of intense clinical and developmental research. In particular, renewed interest in TXA has arisen following evidence that it has a beneficial effect in reducing blood loss in a variety of medical and surgical conditions at increased risk of bleeding. Given this characteristic, TXA is currently considered a mainstay of patient blood management programs aimed at reducing patients' exposure to allogeneic blood transfusion. Importantly, recent large randomized controlled trials have consistently documented that the use of TXA confers a survival advantage in a number of globally critical clinical conditions associated with acute bleeding, including traumatic injury and postpartum hemorrhage, without increasing the thromboembolic risk.

### Tranexamic acid for reducing mortality in emergency and urgent surgery [^11391WMo]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Emergency or urgent surgery, defined as surgery that must be conducted promptly to save life, limb, or functional capacity, is associated with a high risk of bleeding and death. Antifibrinolytic agents, such as tranexamic acid, inhibit blood clot breakdown (fibrinolysis) and can reduce perioperative bleeding. Tranexamic acid has been shown to reduce the need for a blood transfusion in adult patients undergoing elective surgery; however, its effects in patients undergoing emergency or urgent surgery remain unclear.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of tranexamic acid on mortality, blood transfusion, and thromboembolic events in adults undergoing emergency or urgent surgery.

- **Search methods**: We searched the following electronic databases: the Cochrane Injuries Group's Specialised Register (22 August 2012), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (2012, issue 8 of 12), MEDLINE (Ovid SP) 1950 to August Week 2, 2012, PubMed 1 June 2012 to 22 August 2012, EMBASE (Ovid SP) 1980 to 2012 Week 33, ISI Web of Science: Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Science (CPCI-S) 1990 to 22 August 2012, and ISI Web of Science: Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED) 1970 to 22 August 2012. We also searched online trial registries on 22 August 2012 to identify unpublished studies.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials comparing tranexamic acid with no tranexamic acid or placebo in adults undergoing emergency or urgent surgery.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors examined titles, abstracts, and keywords of citations from the electronic databases for eligibility.

### When to use tranexamic acid for the treatment of major bleeding [^112vnCc6]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2024). Low credibility.

Tranexamic acid (TXA) is an antifibrinolytic agent originally developed for the management of bleeding in the setting of postpartum hemorrhage (PPH). Over the last 15 years, there has been accumulating evidence on the use of TXA for the treatment of active bleeding in a variety of clinical contexts. Clinical trials have shown that the efficacy and safety of TXA for the treatment of bleeding differ according to the clinical context in which it is being administered, timing of administration, and dose. Early administration is important for efficacy, particularly in trauma and PPH. Further studies are needed to understand the mechanisms by which TXA provides benefit, optimal modes of administration and dosing, and its effect in some clinical settings, such as spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage.

There is no evidence that TXA increases the risk of thrombotic events in patients with major bleeding overall. However, there is evidence of increased risk of venous thrombosis in patients with gastrointestinal bleeding, as well as an increased risk of seizures with the use of higher doses. This review summarizes the evidence for the use of TXA for patients with active bleeding and highlights the importance of generating evidence of the efficacy and safety of hemostatic interventions specific to the bleeding contexts — as findings from one clinical setting may not be generalizable to other contexts — and that of individual patient assessment for bleeding, thrombotic, and other risks. Additionally, the paper underscores logistical and practical considerations necessary to optimize care.

### Coagulation support during perioperative bleeding management [^112z54Fc]. Intensive Care Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

Multiple trauma trials report the benefit of antifibrinolytic use of tranexamic acid (TXA) with early administration in severely injured patients. However, despite its extensive use, administration for severe (isolated) traumatic brain injury and gastrointestinal bleeding is debated due to the potential for increased thromboembolic risk. In trauma patients, there is concern regarding administering TXA in patients who demonstrate fibrinolytic shutdown, a consideration based on observational data reporting the association of TXA with fibrinolytic shutdown and mortality. However, in European guidelines, TXA is routinely administered.

### Effect of tranexamic acid by baseline risk of death in acute bleeding patients: a meta-analysis of individual patient-level data from 28 333 patients [^112QkdTC]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2020). High credibility.

Tranexamic acid appears to be safe and effective regardless of the baseline risk for patients treated within 3 hours since injury. Because many deaths occur in patients at low and intermediate risk, tranexamic acid use should not be restricted to the most severely injured or bleeding patients. As tranexamic acid is safe, it should be considered as an early preventive measure rather than a treatment for severe coagulopathic bleeding.

### Is topical tranexamic acid effective in treating epistaxis [^112bkp9x]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Low credibility.

Topical tranexamic acid is used to treat epistaxis. We reviewed the evidence for this practice and found, based on the literature, it may be a useful adjunct in managing epistaxis.

### The European guideline on management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following trauma: sixth edition [^114Pc711]. Critical Care (2023). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for transfusion strategies in critical care, more specifically with respect to tranexamic acid, ABC-T 2023 guidelines recommend administering tranexamic acid in patients with trauma who have bleeding or are at risk of significant bleeding as soon as possible, if feasible, en route to the hospital and within 3 hours after injury. This should be at a loading dose of 1 g infused over 10 minutes, followed by an IV infusion of 1 g over 8 hours.

### Safety and efficacy of local tranexamic acid for the prevention of surgical bleeding in soft-tissue surgery: A review of the literature and recommendations for plastic surgery [^1165KoAK]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2022). Low credibility.

- **Local infiltration or topical application**: Although local infiltration may provide higher and longer-lasting levels of tranexamic acid in the tissue, infiltrated tranexamic acid may not reach the raw wound surface to the same extent as free-flowing, topically applied tranexamic acid. Although topical (i.e. intraarticular) application of tranexamic acid has been proven noninferior to intravenous administration in orthopedic surgery, studies assessing infiltration are few and find less effect.

In liposuction, systemic or infiltrative administration are the only options. In larger open surgeries, complete contact between the raw wound surface and tranexamic acid is more easily achieved through moistening than infiltration. In surgeries with smaller wound areas, such as dermal surgeries, rhinoplasties, face lifts, and blepharoplasties, sufficiently large volumes of cocktail solutions may be injected to ensure contact between tranexamic acid and the raw wound, providing a longer-lasting depot effect. Dosing and practicality may guide the mode of administration.

The HALT-IT study, published by HALT-IT Trial Collaborators in 2020 in the journal Lancet, investigated the effects of a high-dose 24-hour infusion of tranexamic acid on death and thromboembolic events in patients with acute gastrointestinal bleeding. This study addressed diseases such as non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding, variceal hemorrhage, and lower gastrointestinal bleeding.

The trial asked: what is the effect of a high-dose 24-hour infusion of tranexamic acid in patients with acute gastrointestinal bleeding? The study design was multi-center, double-blinded, and randomized controlled trial (RCT). The population consisted of 12,009 patients (4,266 females and 7,743 males). Inclusion criteria were adult patients with significant upper or lower gastrointestinal bleeding, defined as at risk of bleeding to death. A key exclusion criterion was the clinician's uncertainty about using an antifibrinolytic agent in specific patients with upper or lower gastrointestinal bleeding.

The interventions included 5,994 patients receiving tranexamic acid (slow intravenous infusion of a 1 g loading dose followed by a maintenance dose of 3 g for 24 hours) and 6,015 patients receiving a placebo (matching intravenous infusion of sodium chloride 0.9%).

- **Primary outcome**: There was no significant difference in the rate of death due to bleeding within five days (3.7% vs. 3.8%; RR 0.99, 99% CI 0.82 to 1.18).

- **Secondary outcomes**
- No significant difference was observed in arterial thromboembolic events (myocardial infarction or stroke) (0.7% vs. 0.8%; RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.6 to 1.39).
- There was a significant increase in venous thromboembolic events (DVT or PE).

### Efficacy of high dose tranexamic acid (TXA) for hemorrhage: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^117ExdE9]. Injury (2023). High credibility.

Standard dose (≤ 1 g) tranexamic acid (TXA) has established a mortality benefit in trauma patients. The role of high dose IV TXA (≥ 2 g or ≥ 30 mg/kg as a single bolus) has been evaluated in the surgical setting; however, it has not been studied in trauma. We reviewed the available evidence of high dose IV TXA in any setting with the goal of informing its use in the adult trauma population.

- **Methods**: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and unpublished sources from inception until July 27, 2022, for studies that compared standard dose with high dose IV TXA in adults (≥ 16 years of age) with hemorrhage. Screening and data abstraction were done independently and in duplicate. We pooled trial data using a random effects model and considered randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational cohort studies separately. We assessed the individual study risk of bias using the Cochrane Risk of Bias for RCTs and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for observational cohort studies. The overall certainty of evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation).

- **Results**: We included 20 studies with a combined total of 12,523 patients. Based on pooled RCT data, and as compared to standard dose TXA, high dose IV TXA probably decreases transfusion requirements (odds ratio [OR] 0.86, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.76 to 0.97, moderate certainty) but with possibly no effect on blood loss (mean difference [MD] 43.31 mL less, 95% CI 135.53 to 48.90 mL less, low certainty) and an uncertain effect on thromboembolic events (OR 1.33, 95% CI 0).

### Intravenous tranexamic acid in gastrointestinal bleeding: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^1157fqk1]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Gastrointestinal bleeding is a critical condition associated with high morbidity and mortality, necessitating effective management strategies. Tranexamic acid (TXA), an anti-fibrinolytic agent, has been proposed as a therapeutic option to reduce bleeding complications. However, recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have produced conflicting results regarding its efficacy and safety.

- **Method**: This systematic review and meta-analysis followed PRISMA guidelines and included RCTs evaluating the use of intravenous TXA in adult patients with gastrointestinal bleeding. Comprehensive searches were conducted in PubMed and Google Scholar, yielding 518 publications, with 7 RCTs meeting inclusion criteria. Data were synthesized using mainly a random-effects model to assess outcomes, including mortality, rebleeding, failure to control bleeding, thromboembolic events, and blood transfusion requirements.

- **Result**: The analysis included 7 RCTs of 13,608 participants, revealing that IV TXA was statistically significant in reducing rebleeding rates (OR 0.64; 95% CI: 0.45–0.91, P = 0.01) and failure to control bleeding (OR 0.55; 95% CI: 0.45–0.91, P = 0.03). However, there was no significant reduction in mortality (OR 0.77; 95% CI: 0.56–1.07, P = 0.12) or blood transfusion requirements (OR 0.94; 95% CI: 0.61–1.43, P = 0.76). While thromboembolic events showed no significant difference in the random-effects model (OR 1.28; 95% CI: 0.51–4.51, P = 0.46), fixed-effect analysis suggested a statistical significance (OR 1.28; 95% CI: 1.07–1.55, P = 0.009).

Intravenous TXA demonstrates effectiveness in specific areas of treatment, though further investigation into its impact on mortality and thromboembolic events is needed.

### Increased urokinase and consumption of α-antiplasmin as an explanation for the loss of benefit of tranexamic acid after treatment delay [^115dxeuT]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2019). Low credibility.

Delayed treatment with tranexamic acid results in the loss of efficacy and poor outcomes. Increasing urokinase activity may account for adverse effects of late tranexamic acid treatment. Urokinase and tranexamic acid together produce plasmin in plasma or blood, disrupting clotting. Consumption of α2-antiplasmin with ongoing fibrinolysis increases plasmin-induced coagulopathy.

Tranexamic acid is an effective antifibrinolytic agent with a proven safety record; however, large clinical trials show it becomes ineffective or harmful if treatment is delayed beyond 3 hours. The mechanism is unknown, but urokinase plasminogen activator has been implicated.

Inhibitory mechanisms were explored in a variety of clot lysis systems using plasma and whole blood. Lysis by tissue plasminogen activator, and plasmin was investigated. Coagulopathy was investigated using activated partial thromboplastin time.

IC50 values for antifibrinolytic activity varied from 1000 μmol L−1, depending on the system, but good fibrin protection was observed in the presence of plasmin. However, in plasma or blood, active plasmin was generated by urokinase and tranexamic acid, leading to coagulopathy and poor clot formation. The extent of coagulopathy was sensitive to available α2-antiplasmin. No clot formed with plasma containing 40% normal α2-antiplasmin after short incubation with urokinase and tranexamic acid. Adding purified α2-antiplasmin progressively restored clotting. Plasmin could be inhibited by aprotinin, with IC50 = 530 nmol L−1, in plasma.

Tranexamic acid protects against fibrinolysis, but the timing and interaction with urokinase can lead to adverse effects if not managed carefully.

### Tranexamic acid in trauma: How should we use it [^117U4KxE]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2015). Low credibility.

Tranexamic acid (TXA) reduces blood loss by inhibiting the enzymatic breakdown of fibrin. It is often used in surgery to decrease bleeding and the need for blood transfusion. In 2011, results from a multi-center, randomized, and placebo-controlled trial (CRASH-2 trial) showed that TXA (1 g loading dose over 10 min followed by an infusion of 1 g over 8 h) safely reduces mortality in bleeding trauma patients. Initiation of TXA treatment within 3 hours of injury reduces the risk of hemorrhage death by about one-third, regardless of baseline risk. Because it does not have any serious adverse effects, TXA can be administered to a wide spectrum of bleeding trauma patients. Limiting its use to the most severely injured or those with a diagnosis of 'hyperfibrinolysis' would result in thousands of avoidable deaths. A clinical trial (CRASH-3 trial) of TXA in patients with traumatic brain injury is now in progress.

### Figo recommendations on the management of postpartum hemorrhage 2022 [^116MQfLD]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2022). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for postpartum hemorrhage, specifically concerning tranexamic acid, FIGO 2022 guidelines recommend administering 1 g (100 mg/mL) tranexamic acid IV at 1 mL/min over 10 minutes. A second dose of 1 g IV should be administered if bleeding continues after 30 minutes or if bleeding restarts within 24 hours of completing the first dose.

### Effect of tranexamic acid on mortality in patients with traumatic bleeding: Prespecified analysis of data from randomised controlled trial [^113VxUxB]. BMJ (2012). Low credibility.

The objectives of this study were to examine whether the effect of tranexamic acid on the risk of death and thrombotic events in patients with traumatic bleeding varies according to baseline risk of death, and to assess the extent to which protocols for treatment with tranexamic acid maximize benefits to patients.

- **Design**: This was a prespecified stratified analysis of data from an international multicentre randomised controlled trial (the CRASH-2 trial), with an estimation of the proportion of premature deaths that could potentially be averted through the administration of tranexamic acid.

- **Participants**: A total of 13,273 trauma patients in the CRASH-2 trial who were treated with tranexamic acid or placebo within three hours of injury, along with trauma patients enrolled in the UK Trauma and Audit Research Network, were stratified by risk of death at baseline (50%).

- **Intervention**: Participants received either tranexamic acid (1 g over 10 minutes followed by 1 g over eight hours) or a matching placebo.

- **Main outcome measure**: Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for death in the hospital within four weeks of injury, deaths from bleeding, and fatal and non-fatal thrombotic events associated with the use of tranexamic acid according to baseline risk of death were measured. Unless there was strong evidence against the null hypothesis of homogeneity of effects (P < 0.001), the overall odds ratio was used as the most reliable guide to the odds ratios in all strata.

Results indicated tranexamic acid was associated with a significant reduction in all-cause mortality and deaths from bleeding. In each stratum of baseline risk, there were fewer deaths among patients treated with tranexamic acid.

### Effect of tranexamic acid on children with traumatic bleeding: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^116ryfAj]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). High credibility.

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tranexamic acid (TXA) in the treatment of traumatic bleeding in children.

- **Methods**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Embase, MEDLINE, and Web of Science for relevant cohort and randomized controlled trials, excluding studies with other anti-bleeding treatments or patients with underlying bleeding disorders. Outcomes included mortality, ICU admission, surgical intervention, transfusions, hospital stay, seizures, and thromboembolic events. Statistical analysis employed odds ratios (OR) in random-effects models.

- **Results**: Ten studies (1 randomized controlled trial, 9 retrospective cohorts; n = 34,144) were included. The pooled results revealed that TXA significantly reduced mortality (OR 0.58; 95% CI, 0.38–0.89), especially with a 1 g initial dose. However, no significant differences were found in other outcomes. TXA use was associated with a slight increase in seizures but no rise in thromboembolic events. The overall safety profile was favorable.

- **Conclusion**: Our study highlights the potential benefits of TXA in reducing mortality in pediatric trauma cases and underscores the need for further research to determine optimal dosing and timing strategies.

### Increased urokinase and consumption of α-antiplasmin as an explanation for the loss of benefit of tranexamic acid after treatment delay [^113teGAz]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2019). Low credibility.

Plasmin generation by uPA and TXA reveals that TXA can protect fibrin from breakdown in various formats when either tPA or uPA acts as an activator or when plasmin is directly applied. By modifying the methods used in Figures 1 and 3, so that plasmin chromogenic substrate was added to preformed clots along with uPA or tPA, it was possible to detect plasmin release from the clot.

- **Results**:
	- Figure 4 (A) shows results from the halo/plasma clot system (no added Alexa Fluor fibrinogen), whereas Figure 4 (B) presents results from another microtiter plate plasma clot lysis system (shown in Figure 1), now including S‐2251.
	- In both formats, active plasmin was released by uPA, but not by tPA, in the presence of TXA. Stimulation begins above 10 μmol L^−1 TXA and peaks around 100 μmol L^−1, followed by a decline in Figure 4 (B). However, this decline is not observed in the halo format, Figure 4 (A).
	- Figure 4 (B) also illustrates that the plasmin inhibitor aprotinin can block plasmin activity generated by uPA and TXA. Calculations on the dose response of aprotinin give an estimated IC₅₀ of 530 (± 119) nmol L^−1 (see Figure 4 B inset).

- **Figure 4 Description**:
	- Shows the generation of plasmin from clots incubated with urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) or tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and tranexamic acid (TXA).
	- Panel A utilized the plasma clot halo system, where plasminogen activator, TXA, and plasmin chromogenic substrate S‐2251 were added to preformed clots. Initial rates of plasmin generation were calculated from plots of absorbance vs. time squared, and the points shown are measured values.

### Tranexamic acid for the prevention and treatment of postpartum haemorrhage [^115UX9sL]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2015). Low credibility.

Postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) is a major cause of maternal mortality, accounting for one-quarter of all maternal deaths worldwide. Uterotonics after birth are the only intervention that has been shown to be effective for PPH prevention. Tranexamic acid (TXA), an antifibrinolytic agent, has therefore been investigated as a potentially useful complement to this for both prevention and treatment, because its hypothesized mechanism of action in PPH supplements that of uterotonics and because it has been proved to reduce blood loss in elective surgery, bleeding in trauma patients, and menstrual blood loss. This review covers evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for PPH prevention after caesarean (n = 10) and vaginal (n = 2) deliveries and for PPH treatment after vaginal delivery (n = 1). It discusses its efficacy and side effects overall and in relation to the various doses studied for both indications. TXA appears to be a promising drug for the prevention and treatment of PPH after both vaginal and caesarean delivery. Nevertheless, the level of evidence supporting its efficacy is insufficient, as are the data about its benefit:harm ratio. Large, adequately powered multicentre RCTs are required before its widespread use for preventing and treating PPH can be recommended.

### Tranexamic acid for upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^113sLVMH]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). High credibility.

Tranexamic acid reduces hemorrhage through its antifibrinolytic effects. In a previous version of the present review, we found that tranexamic acid may reduce mortality. This review includes updated searches and new trials.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of tranexamic acid versus no intervention, placebo, or other anti-ulcer drugs for upper gastrointestinal bleeding.

- **Search methods**: We updated the review by performing electronic database searches in July 2014, including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Science Citation Index.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials, irrespective of language or publication status, were included.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We used the standard methodological procedures of The Cochrane Collaboration. All-cause mortality, bleeding, and adverse events were the primary outcome measures. We performed fixed-effect and random-effects model meta-analyses and presented results as risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). I² was used as a measure of between-trial heterogeneity. We analyzed tranexamic acid versus placebo or no intervention and tranexamic acid versus anti-ulcer drugs separately. Subgroup, sensitivity, and sequential analyses were conducted to analyze sources of heterogeneity and robustness of the overall results.

- **Main results**: We included eight randomized controlled trials on tranexamic acid for upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Additionally, we identified one large ongoing pragmatic randomized controlled trial from which data are not yet available. Control groups were randomly assigned.

### The never ending success story of tranexamic acid in acquired bleeding [^112WzGz9]. Haematologica (2020). High credibility.

Tranexamic acid (TXA) is an anti-fibrinolytic agent that acts by inhibiting plasminogen activation and fibrinolysis. Although its first clinical use dates back more than 50 years, this hemostatic agent is still the object of intense clinical and developmental research. Renewed interest in TXA has arisen following evidence that it has a beneficial effect in reducing blood loss in various medical and surgical conditions with an increased risk of bleeding. Given this characteristic, TXA is considered a mainstay of patient blood management programs aimed at reducing patients' exposure to allogeneic blood transfusion. Importantly, recent large randomized controlled trials have consistently documented that the use of TXA confers a survival advantage in several globally critical clinical conditions associated with acute bleeding, including traumatic injury and postpartum hemorrhage, without increasing the thromboembolic risk.

### The utility and safety of prophylactic tranexamic acid in tonsillectomy: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^113UKRDF]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Our systematic review (SR) has several strengths. We opted for a strong design, including only randomized controlled trials (RCTs), to generate high-quality evidence. Our primary outcome was chosen based on practical considerations, aiming to reduce tonsillectomy-related morbidity. We performed subgroup and sensitivity analyses to address heterogeneity across included studies and to explore the impact of tranexamic acid (TXA) among specific groups of interest, such as adults versus pediatric patients. We also evaluated the certainty of evidence and strength of recommendations using the GRADE system.

We performed a qualitative data analysis to assess the definitions for post-tonsillectomy hemorrhage (PTH) used in each included RCT. Falbe-Hansen et al. defined PTH as bleeding requiring treatment in the operating room (OR). This study was subsequently excluded in the sensitivity analysis. We believe that a broad and inclusive definition for PTH is more appropriate. Any type of PTH needs to be reported, whether it is simply blood-tinged saliva or bleeding that requires intervention in the OR. PTH can be distressing for patients, regardless of its severity, as they have no direct way of visualizing or controlling their bleeding. Bleeding may be recurring, and minor bleeding can be the first sign (sentinel bleed) of more significant, life-threatening bleeding. Some patients, particularly children, may swallow or aspirate blood rather than spitting it out. Therefore, it is crucial to investigate all cases of PTH.

Our study has some limitations. First, there is difficulty in extracting data and combining results from trials that utilize different surgical techniques and protocols.

### Cyklokapron [^115WMAkq]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Available data from published studies, case series, and case reports with tranexamic acid use in pregnant women in the second and third trimesters and at the time of delivery have not clarified whether there is a drug-associated risk of miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There are two (0.02%) infant cases with structural abnormalities that resulted in death when tranexamic acid was used during conception or the first trimester of pregnancy; however, due to other confounding factors, the risk of major birth defects with the use of tranexamic acid during pregnancy is not clear. Tranexamic acid is known to pass the placenta and appears in cord blood at concentrations approximately equal to maternal concentration (see Data).

Reproduction studies performed in mice, rats, and rabbits have not revealed any adverse effects on the fetus due to tranexamic acid administered during organogenesis. Doses examined were multiples of up to three times (mouse), six times (rat), and three times (rabbit) the maximum human dose based on body surface area in the mouse, rat, and rabbit, respectively (see Data).

The estimated background risk for major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2–4% and 15–20%, respectively.

It is not known whether tranexamic acid use in pregnant women may cause a drug-associated risk of miscarriage.

### The utility and safety of prophylactic tranexamic acid in tonsillectomy: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^116VRXoj]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

We evaluated the certainty of evidence and strength of recommendations using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system. The final quality of evidence was classified as high, moderate, low, or very low for each clinical outcome. Two reviewers performed the classification of GRADE independently.

All statistical analyses were conducted using RevMan Web, version 6.4.0. For continuous data, such as blood volume loss, a mean difference and 95% confidence interval (CI) were utilized. For outcomes that were dichotomous, including postoperative hemorrhage (PTH), the need for transfusion, further intervention, and adverse effects, relative risk or risk ratio (RR) with its corresponding 95% CI was used. Random-effect models with inverse variance methods (Der Simonian and Laird method) were applied. We also calculated the number needed to treat (NNT) with tranexamic acid (TXA) to achieve one less PTH. The NNT was calculated using the formula: NNT = 1/[π₀ × (1 − RR)], with an assumed comparator risk (π₀) of 4.5%.

Heterogeneity across individual studies was assessed using the I² index, and heterogeneity was considered significant for an I² value greater than 50%. We assessed publication bias visually using funnel plots. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were conducted based on predefined hypotheses to explain potential statistical heterogeneity, such as the risk of bias of trials, age of patients (adults vs. children, with an adult defined as age ≥ 18 years), indication for surgery, mode of administration of TXA, and dose.

### The never ending success story of tranexamic acid in acquired bleeding [^111L9oMy]. Haematologica (2020). High credibility.

Very recent evidence indicates that tranexamic acid (TXA) usage results in a significant reduction of obstetric bleeding. In the landmark randomized, double-blind World Maternal Antifibrinolytic (WOMAN) trial, more than 20,000 women with postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) following vaginal or Cesarean delivery were assigned to receive either TXA (1 g TXA intravenously as soon as possible, followed by a further 1 g if bleeding continued after 30 minutes or restarted within 24 hours of the initial dose) or a placebo. The trial showed decreased overall mortality due to bleeding in the TXA group (RR 0.81, 95% CI: 0.65–1.00; P = 0.045), and no differences in venous or arterial thromboembolic events were observed between women in the two arms.

Similarly to the CRASH trials, in the WOMAN trial, patients receiving TXA within three hours from delivery had the most marked mortality reduction (89 deaths in the TXA group vs. 127 deaths in the placebo group, RR 0.69, 95% CI: 0.52–0.91; P = 0.008). Thanks to the results of this global trial, a 2017 World Health Organization recommendation for the treatment of PPH states that TXA should be recognized as a life-saving intervention and made readily available for the management of PPH in settings where emergency obstetric care is provided, regardless of the level of healthcare system resources. In addition, the recent Network for the Advancement of Patient Blood Management, Haemostasis and Thrombosis (NATA) consensus statement recommends the administration of TXA (1 g by intravenous route) as soon as possible within the first three hours after PPH onset, with this dose repeated after 30 minutes if bleeding continues (grade 1B recommendation).

All in all, these large trials document…

### Effect of tranexamic acid on surgical bleeding: Systematic review and cumulative meta-analysis [^115wboCE]. BMJ (2012). Low credibility.

Overall, 44 (34%) trials were judged to be at low risk of bias for sequence generation, and five (4%) were at high risk (see the supplementary file for the risk of bias judgments for each methodological quality item for the included trials). The risk of bias in the remaining 80 (62%) trials was unclear due to a lack of information. Allocation was adequately concealed in 36 trials (28%) and inadequately concealed in six (5%), with the other 87 (67%) presenting insufficient information to allow judgment. Of the 95 trials with data on blood transfusion, 69 (73%) were judged at low risk of blinding, four (4%) at high risk, and 22 (23%) were unclear. The risk of bias for blinding was similar for thromboembolic outcomes (myocardial infarction, stroke, deep vein thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism), with about 70% judged to be at low risk, 5% at high risk, and 25% at unclear risk. All 72 trials with mortality outcomes were judged to be at low risk of bias for blinding. Of 115 trials reporting eligible outcome data, 72 (63%) were at low risk of bias for incomplete outcome data, 17 (15%) at high risk, and 26 (23%) did not provide adequate information to permit judgment.

- **Quantitative data synthesis**: Table 1 presents the results of the meta-analysis.

The analysis focuses on the effect of tranexamic acid on blood transfusion, thromboembolic events, and mortality and includes a test for effect.

### Is topical tranexamic acid effective in treating epistaxis [^115RDyhF]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Low credibility.

Review of the relevant literature suggests that topical tranexamic acid (TXA) could potentially be a useful adjunct in the management of anterior epistaxis. However, the evidence is somewhat flawed, and multiple limitations have been identified. Further study is warranted to ascertain the role of topical TXA in the management of epistaxis.

### Tranexamic acid-associated seizures: Causes and treatment [^114SbALE]. Annals of Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) originally approved tranexamic acid (TXA) for treating patients with hemophilia undergoing dental surgery and women experiencing heavy menstrual bleeding. The clinical indications for TXA have rapidly expanded to include multiple off-label uses, such as cardiac, gastrointestinal, and orthopedic surgery, as well as the treatment of postpartum hemorrhage. The World Health Organization (WHO) recently included TXA in its Model List of Essential Medicines, recommending its use to reduce blood loss in patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass procedures, in trauma patients with significant hemorrhage, and in patients with postpartum hemorrhage.

The broad introduction of TXA into surgical care has resulted in a reported increase in seizures, particularly during the early postoperative period after cardiac surgery. Retrospective analyses have shown that the incidence of seizures in postoperative cardiac patients has increased from 0.5–1.0% to 6.4–7.3% with the use of higher doses of TXA. Additionally, several multicenter retrospective studies confirm increased seizures in postoperative patients who received TXA, with an incidence ranging from 0.9% to 2.5%. A single prospective trial found that seizures occurred in 3% (3 of 100 patients) of post-cardiac surgical patients treated with TXA. Although the incidence of TXA-associated seizures after cardiac surgery varies between studies, treatment with TXA was identified as a contributing factor.

### The never ending success story of tranexamic acid in acquired bleeding [^112jUKQf]. Haematologica (2020). Low credibility.

There is a growing body of evidence documenting the efficacy of tranexamic acid (TXA) in preventing bleeding in various major surgical procedures, especially cardiac surgery, within patient blood management (PBM) programs. In a systematic review and meta-analysis, TXA was shown to reduce blood losses in surgical patients by nearly one-third compared to placebo. These results were consistent with those of a Cochrane systematic review, including 129 trials with 10,488 participants, which showed that TXA reduced the probability of receiving a blood transfusion by one-third [relative risk (RR) 0.62, 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 0.58–0.65; P < 0.001].

More recently, TXA has been widely used to minimize bleeding and exposure to allogeneic blood transfusion in major orthopedic surgery. Several large randomized controlled trials (RCT) and meta-analyses have consistently confirmed that the intravenous administration of this medication effectively and safely reduces perioperative blood loss and transfusion requirements during major orthopedic operations such as total hip and knee arthroplasty. Some concerns still remain among users over the hypothetical increased risk of thromboembolic complications following the systemic infusion of this anti-fibrinolytic agent, because orthopedic surgery is associated not only with a high risk of bleeding but also thrombosis. Thus, to refute this unjustified, non-evidence-based perception — which represents the main obstacle to a broader use of TXA in this clinical context — we recently conducted a systematic review.

### Increased urokinase and consumption of α-antiplasmin as an explanation for the loss of benefit of tranexamic acid after treatment delay [^1137vyGB]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2019). Low credibility.

Tranexamic acid (TXA) is a potent antifibrinolytic that has been in common use for many years with an excellent safety record. As a lysine analogue, TXA binds to kringle domains that have an affinity for lysine residues in proteins, and for fibrinolysis, the relevant kringles are in plasminogen and plasmin, and kringle 2 of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). By blocking plasminogen–fibrin interactions (and to a lesser extent tPA–fibrin interactions), TXA inhibits tPA‐catalysed plasmin generation. By binding to plasmin kringles, TXA can inhibit plasmin accumulation by fibrin and directly reduce fibrinolysis.

Antifibrinolytics, including lysine analogues and the direct plasmin inhibitor aprotinin (Trasylol™), have been employed over many years to limit blood loss and reduce volumes of blood and blood product transfusions in a range of surgical procedures, in particular in cardiopulmonary bypass and orthopedic surgery. Lysine analogues can also be taken orally to help in the management of menorrhagia and have been explored as adjuncts to clotting factor replacement therapy to treat hemophilia. Antifibrinolytics have been shown to be effective in the treatment of bleeding and reducing mortality, particularly in two large trials on trauma (CRASH‐2) and post‐partum hemorrhage (WOMAN trial). Subsequent subgroup analysis found early treatment in under 3 hours is most effective and later treatment can be harmful. A recent meta‐analysis of more than 40,000 acute severely bleeding patients provided a model indicating each 15-minute delay…

### Tranexamic acid for the management of obstetric hemorrhage [^114Pxgsv]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Low credibility.

Obstetric hemorrhage remains the most common cause of maternal mortality worldwide. It is believed that increased fibrinolytic activity, secondary to the release and activation of endothelial tissue plasminogen activator, is involved in its pathogenesis. Tranexamic acid (TXA), an antifibrinolytic agent, has been shown to be beneficial in trauma patients if used within 3 hours of injury.

A recent large randomized controlled trial demonstrated that TXA given to hemorrhaging women within 3 hours after delivery was associated with a decreased risk of death resulting from bleeding, with no increase in thromboembolic complications. Limited evidence suggests that prophylactic TXA reduces blood loss at the time of delivery and decreases transfusion rates in the obstetric population. Tranexamic acid appears to be a safe and effective option in the treatment of obstetric hemorrhage.

In addition, the limited available evidence supports the need for a well-designed, adequately powered clinical trial to test its benefit as a prophylactic agent.

### The never ending success story of tranexamic acid in acquired bleeding [^111MWqpL]. Haematologica (2020). High credibility.

Given the efficacy of tranexamic acid (TXA) in various conditions at potential risk of severe bleeding, several groups have evaluated its use in preventing obstetric hemorrhage. Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) is a leading cause of premature maternal mortality globally, accounting for at least 100,000 deaths each year worldwide. A recent Cochrane systematic review evaluated TXA in the prevention of PPH. Within an analysis of 12 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving 3,285 women, TXA was found to decrease postpartum blood loss, prevent PPH, and lower blood transfusion requirements.

We have conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis on the use of TXA for PPH prevention in women undergoing Cesarean delivery. After an in-depth analysis of 18 RCTs involving 4,557 women, it was found that the prophylactic use of TXA significantly reduced the incidence of PPH, total blood loss, and transfusion requirements without increasing the risk of thromboembolic complications, thus supporting its beneficial effect in this critical clinical setting. The most recent multidisciplinary consensus statement on the prevention and treatment of PPH from the Network for the Advancement of Patient Blood Management, Haemostasis and Thrombosis (NATA) recommends the intravenous use of TXA for women at increased risk of PPH (grade 1C recommendation).

On the whole, these multiple and consistent findings show that TXA is effective at preventing bleeding complications in a variety of medical and surgical conditions without increasing the risk of thrombosis.

### Efficacy and safety of tranexamic acid in prevention of postpartum hemorrhage: a systematic review and meta-analysis of 18,649 patients [^111RfdYQ]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). High credibility.

In recent years, TXA has gained attention as an effective treatment for PPH. Several studies have investigated the efficacy and safety of TXA in PPH. The WOMAN trial, a large randomized controlled trial involving over 20,000 women from 21 countries, found that TXA reduced the risk of death due to bleeding by 31% when given within three hours of birth. Another study conducted in Nigeria also showed that TXA reduced the need for blood transfusion and hysterectomy in women with PPH.

While some studies have shown promising results for TXA, limited studies have provided a full understanding of its effectiveness and potential side effects. Therefore, this meta-analysis aims to update clinical evidence and determine the clinical efficacy and safety of TXA in the prevention of PPH. We collected up-to-date studies on both caesarean birth (CB) and vaginal birth (VB), which will assist physicians in deciding whether to include TXA in their routine preoperative prophylaxis for PPH.

### Hemoptysis? Try inhaled tranexamic acid [^113krbwe]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Tranexamic acid (TXA) is a synthetic anti-fibrinolytic agent used to prevent and treat various bleeding complications. In many studies, investigators have evaluated its utility and safety when used orally, intravenously, and topically. However, few studies have described the potential benefits of nebulized TXA.

- **Case report**: We present a case of massive hemoptysis treated with nebulized TXA in the emergency department (ED), which led to the cessation of bleeding and avoidance of endotracheal intubation.

- **Why should an emergency physician be aware of this?** In massive hemoptysis, rapidly available nebulized TXA may be considered a therapeutic option, serving either as primary therapy or as a bridge until other definitive therapies can be arranged.

### The effect of tranexamic acid on blood transfusion in lower gastrointestinal bleeding-a double blind prospective randomised controlled trial [^113XSicj]. World Journal of Surgery (2024). High credibility.

Acute gastrointestinal bleeding is a common emergency. Tranexamic acid (TXA) reduces clot breakdown by inhibiting the action of plasmin and has been shown to reduce the need for blood transfusion in trauma, surgical procedures, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. This study examined the efficiency of intravenous TXA in patients with acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding.

- **Methods**: Eighty-one patients aged over 18 years with lower GI hemorrhage, presenting as active rectal bleeding and anemia (hemoglobin lower than 11 g/dL or a decrease of 2 g/dL from the patient's base level), were enrolled in this single-center, double-blind prospective research. Patients were randomly assigned to receive intravenous TXA or placebo from admission until colonoscopy took place. The need for transfusion of packed red blood cells (PRBC) and the number of units was recorded and compared between the two groups.

- **Results**: Eighty-one patients were randomized in this study, thirty-nine in the TXA arm, and forty-two in the placebo arm. Patient characteristics did not differ between the groups. Forty-three out of the 81 patients received blood transfusions; twenty-two were in the placebo arm and twenty-one in the TXA arm (p = 0.89). Twenty-nine patients required 2 or more units, 14 in the TXA arm and 15 in the placebo arm (p = 0.98).

- **Conclusions**: Intravenous TXA has no significant effect on blood requirement in patients with lower GI bleeding. There was no difference in the consumption of PRBC units among the patients in the placebo and TXA groups. It seems that tranexamic acid has no significant impact on blood transfusion needs in this context.

### X-ray crystal structure of plasmin with tranexamic acid-derived active site inhibitors [^112aY922]. Blood Advances (2017). Low credibility.

The zymogen protease plasminogen and its active form, plasmin, perform key roles in blood clot dissolution, tissue remodeling, cell migration, and bacterial pathogenesis. Dysregulation of the plasminogen/plasmin system results in life-threatening hemorrhagic disorders or thrombotic vascular occlusion. Accordingly, inhibitors of this system are clinically important. Currently, tranexamic acid (TXA), a molecule that prevents plasminogen activation by blocking recruitment to target substrates, is the most widely used inhibitor for the plasminogen/plasmin system in therapeutics. However, TXA lacks efficacy on the active form of plasmin, highlighting the need to develop specific inhibitors that target the protease active site.

Here, we report the crystal structures of plasmin in complex with the novel YO (trans-4-aminomethylcyclohexanecarbonyl-l-tyrosine-n-octylamide) class of small molecule inhibitors. We found that these inhibitors form key interactions with the S1 and S3' subsites of the catalytic cleft. The TXA moiety of the YO compounds inserts into the primary (S1) specificity pocket, suggesting that TXA itself may function as a weak plasmin inhibitor, a hypothesis supported by subsequent biochemical and biophysical analyses. Mutational studies reveal that F587 of the S' subsite plays a key role in mediating the inhibitor interaction. Taken together, these data provide a foundation for the future development of small molecule inhibitors to specifically regulate plasmin function in a range of diseases and disorders.

### Tranexamic acid for safer surgery: The time is now [^112r4Dqb]. The British Journal of Surgery (2022). High credibility.

There are about 310 million major surgical procedures performed each year worldwide, with more than 4 million deaths within 30 days postoperatively. In the UK, nearly 8 million surgical procedures are conducted annually. Although surgical mortality appears to be decreasing in Britain, approximately 85,000 people die within 30 days, escalating to 178,000 deaths within 90 days. Major bleeding is strongly associated with 30-day mortality, accounting for the largest share (16 percent) of deaths. Major bleeding, primarily occurring on the day of surgery, is more common than sepsis. Consequently, the compelling evidence that tranexamic acid substantially reduces the risk of surgical bleeding holds significant importance for anaesthetists, surgeons, patients, and healthcare systems.

Tranexamic acid reduces bleeding by inhibiting the plasmin-mediated proteolysis of fibrin blood clots. For a decade, evidence supporting tranexamic acid's efficacy in preventing surgical bleeding, thus reducing the need for blood transfusions and reoperation due to bleeding, has been available. However, uncertainty about the risk of thromboembolic events has limited its use. Large randomized trials in trauma (20,211 patients) and postpartum hemorrhage (20,060 patients) demonstrate that tranexamic acid significantly reduces bleeding deaths without increasing the risk of thrombosis. Recent meta-analyses of randomized trials indicate no increased risk of thromboembolic events with tranexamic acid (risk ratio (RR) = 1.00; 95 percent confidence interval 0.93–1.08). Although these analyses included clinical trial data on more than 100,000 patients, many trials were small, limiting their reliability.

### Safety and efficacy of tranexamic acid to minimise perioperative bleeding in hepatic surgery: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1149WVdR]. World Journal of Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Perioperative bleeding poses a major risk during liver surgery, which can result in increased transfusion requirements, morbidity, and mortality. Tranexamic acid (TXA) effectively reduces perioperative bleeding and transfusion requirements in trauma patients; however, there remains a lack of evidence of its use in liver surgery. This meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials evaluated the efficacy and safety of TXA in liver resection and transplantation.

- **Method**: A comprehensive search of Medline, Embase, CENTRAL, and Clinicaltrials.gov databases was conducted to identify studies from January 1947 to September 2021. The outcomes of the need for blood transfusion, thromboembolic events, and mortality were extracted from the included studies. Quantitative pooling of data was based on the random effects model.

- **Results**: Six studies reporting on 429 patients were included. TXA reduced the need for perioperative blood transfusion in liver resection and transplantation (OR 0.09; 95% CI 0.01 to 0.72). More importantly, TXA did not increase the incidence of thromboembolic events (OR 2.22; 95% CI 0.47 to 10.43) and mortality (OR 0.60; 95% CI 0.13 to 2.76).

- **Conclusion**: TXA safely reduces the need for blood transfusion in patients undergoing liver resection and transplantation.

### Tranexamic acid for preventing postpartum haemorrhage after caesarean section [^115nFsYd]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). High credibility.

Tranexamic acid (TXA) is an antifibrinolytic drug that inhibits fibrinolysis by blocking the interaction between plasmin and fibrin. Since it was first identified in the early 1960s, TXA has primarily been used for heavy menstrual bleeding and for reducing bleeding during surgical procedures in high‐risk patients. More recently, early treatment with TXA has been shown to be effective in patients with life‐threatening haemorrhage caused by trauma and childbirth.

In the CRASH 2 Trial, TXA given within one hour reduced mortality by 32%; given between one and three hours, by 21%; and beyond three hours, TXA increased mortality by 44% (P = 0.004). The mechanism for this increase in mortality is unclear. TXA has multiple pharmacological effects. A pharmacovigilance study found a 32.6‐fold increase in adverse renal vascular and ischaemic conditions in women of childbearing age.

The World Maternal Antifibrinolytic (WOMAN) trial assessed the effects of intravenous TXA in 20,060 participants with a clinical diagnosis of PPH. The results showed that TXA reduces the risk of bleeding to death after PPH by one‐third (risk ratio 0.69, 95% confidence interval 0.52 to 0.91; P = 0.008) when given within three hours of birth, with no apparent increase in adverse events. As a result, the WHO recommends early intravenous TXA as a treatment for established PPH. However, neither the overall risk of death nor the risk of hysterectomy (the predefined primary outcome) was reduced.

Many deaths from PPH occur on the day of birth.

### Tranexamic acid for preventing postpartum haemorrhage [^114wFbC9]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) is a common and potentially life-threatening complication of labour. Several options for preventing PPH are available, but further advances in this field are important, especially the identification of safe, easy-to-use, and cost-effective regimens. Tranexamic acid (TA), an antifibrinolytic agent widely used to prevent and treat haemorrhage, merits evaluation to assess whether it meets these criteria.

- **Objectives**: To determine, from the best available evidence, whether TA is effective and safe for preventing PPH in comparison to placebo or no treatment (with or without uterotonic co-treatment), or to uterotonic agents.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (as of 28 January 2015) and reference lists of retrieved studies.

- **Selection criteria**: All published, unpublished, and ongoing randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the use of TA alone or in addition to uterotonics in the third stage of labour or during caesarean section (CS) to prevent PPH.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently assessed for inclusion all potential studies identified as a result of the search strategy. We entered the data into Review Manager software and verified accuracy.

- **Main results**: Twelve trials involving 3,285 healthy women at low risk of excessive bleeding undergoing elective CS (nine trials, 2,453 participants) or spontaneous birth (three trials, 832 participants) satisfied inclusion criteria and contributed data to the analysis. All participants received…

### Does tranexamic acid increase venous thromboembolism risk among trauma patients? A prospective multicenter analysis across 17 level I trauma centers [^111VCc9i]. Injury (2023). High credibility.

The early use of tranexamic acid (TXA) has demonstrated benefits among some trauma patients in hemorrhagic shock. The association between TXA administration and thromboembolic events, including deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), and pulmonary thrombosis (PT), remains unclear. This study aimed to characterize the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) subtypes among trauma patients receiving TXA and to determine whether TXA is associated with VTE risk and mortality.

We analyzed prospective, observational, multicenter cohort data from the Consortium of Leaders in the Study of Traumatic Thromboembolism (CLOTT) study group. The study was conducted across 17 US level I trauma centers between January 1, 2018, and December 31, 2020. We studied trauma patients ages 18–40 years who were admitted for at least 48 hours with a minimum of one VTE risk factor and followed until hospital discharge or 30 days. We compared TXA recipients to non-recipients for VTE and mortality using inverse probability weighted Cox models. The primary outcome was the presence of documented venous thromboembolism (VTE). The secondary outcome was mortality. VTE was defined as DVT, PE, or PT.

Among the 7,331 trauma patients analyzed, 466 (6.4%) received TXA. Patients in the TXA group were more severely injured than patients in the non-TXA group (ISS 16+: 69.1% vs. 48.5%, p < 0.001), and a higher percentage underwent a major surgical procedure (85.8% vs. 73.6%, p < 0.001). Among TXA recipients, 12.5% developed VTE (1.3% PT, 2.4% PE, 8.8% DVT) with 5.6% mortality.

Finally, we would like to outline the safety aspects that emerge from an overall analysis of the various RCTs. The risk of thromboembolic events — including pulmonary embolism, deep-vein thrombosis, myocardial infarction, and stroke — did not differ between the TXA and placebo groups. These data provide definitive strong evidence demonstrating the safety of TXA and render any residual concern unjustified.

### The role of tranexamic acid in plastic surgery: Review and technical considerations [^117BuJc1]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Minimizing blood loss during surgery is critical, and many modalities have been used to decrease unwanted surgical bleeding. Among these methods, the use of pharmacologic agents such as antifibrinolytic drugs has been shown to significantly reduce blood loss and the rates of postoperative blood transfusion in many articles. Tranexamic acid is an antifibrinolytic agent that has been widely used in other surgical specialties, especially in cardiac, orthopedic, and trauma surgery.

Despite its known benefits, the use of tranexamic acid in plastic surgery is extremely limited. This is primarily because most plastic surgery procedures do not involve the extent of blood loss that can lead to anemia and the need for blood transfusions, as is common in major orthopedic and cardiac surgery procedures. Nevertheless, there are significant benefits to be gained from the use of antifibrinolytic drugs in the full range of plastic surgery. In this article, the authors introduce the benefits, dosages, and technical considerations of using tranexamic acid in plastic surgery procedures.

### Efficacy and possible mechanisms of topical tranexamic acid in melasma [^114wio8p]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Tranexamic acid (TA) has been suggested as an effective treatment for melasma. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects and mechanisms of action of topical TA in the treatment of melasma.

In this study, 23 participants with melasma applied a 2% TA formulation to the whole face for 12 weeks. Clinical effects were evaluated using the modified Melasma Area and Severity Index (mMASI) and a chromameter. Skin biopsies were obtained from 10 participants to evaluate pigmentation, vascularity, and the expression levels of possible paracrine factors contributing to the effect of TA.

Most of the participants had mild melasma, with mMASI scores of less than 5. The mMASI scores significantly improved in 22 of 23 participants after application. The L* values increased, and the a* values decreased in both lesional and perilesional normal skin. Fontana-Masson staining showed a significant decrease in melanin content in the epidermis. The number of CD31-positive vessels and the expression of the vascular endothelial growth factor both tended to decrease. Endothelin (ET)-1 was found to be downregulated with TA.

In conclusion, topical TA is effective for treating melasma. This immunohistochemical study found that the suppression of ET-1 could be one of the mechanisms of action of TA on melasma.

### Prophylactic tranexamic acid in patients with hematologic malignancy: a placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial [^114Z1GUU]. Blood (2022). High credibility.

Evidence of the effectiveness of prophylactic use of tranexamic acid (TXA) in thrombocytopenia is lacking. To determine whether TXA safely reduces bleeding incidence in patients undergoing treatment for hematologic malignancies, a randomized, double-blind clinical trial was conducted from June 2016 through June 2020. Of 3,120 screened adults, 356 patients were eligible and enrolled; 337 patients (mean age, 53.9; 141 [41.8%] women) were randomized to receive either 1,300 mg TXA orally or 1,000 mg TXA intravenously (n = 168) versus placebo (n = 169) thrice daily for a maximum of 30 days. Three hundred thirty patients were activated when their platelet counts fell below 30,000 per µL; 279 (83%) had complete outcome ascertainment. World Health Organization (WHO) grade ≥ 2 bleeding was observed in the 30 days following activation in 50.3% (73/145) and 54.2% (78/144) of patients in the TXA and placebo groups, with an adjusted odds ratio of 0.83 (95% confidence interval, 0.50–1.34; p = 0.44). There was no statistically significant difference in the mean number of platelet transfusions (mean difference, 0.1; 95% CI, -1.9 to 2.0), mean days alive without grade ≥ 2 bleeding (mean difference, 0.8; 95% CI, -0.4 to 2.0), thrombotic events (6/163 [3.7%] TXA, 9/163 [5.5%] placebo), or deaths due to serious bleeding.

- **Adverse events**: The most common adverse events included diarrhea (116/164 [70.7%] in the TXA group and 114/163 [69.9%] in the placebo group); febrile neutropenia (111/164 [67.7%] TXA, 105/163 [64.4%] placebo); fatigue (106/164 [64.6%] TXA, 109/163 [66.9%] placebo); and nausea (104/164 [63.4%] TXA, 97/163 [59.5%] placebo).

### SPL drug information for tranexamic acid [^111sGU2U]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of tranexamic acid IV (also known as Lysteda, Cyklokapron):

- **Arterial thromboembolism, VTE**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as tranexamic acid is associated with an increased risk of arterial and VTE, including DVT, PE, and retinal vascular occlusions.

- **Exacerbation of dizziness**: Use caution when taken concomitantly with other medications that may cause dizziness, as this could exacerbate the effect. Advise patients to refrain from driving or operating machinery until they understand how the drug impacts them.

- **Hypersensitivity reactions**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as tranexamic acid may increase the risk of hypersensitivity reactions, ranging from mild pruritus to severe conditions such as angioedema, wheezing, hypotension, and anaphylactic shock.

- **Myoclonus, seizures**: Use extreme caution in patients undergoing cardiovascular surgery, females, individuals over 70 years old, those in poor health, patients with renal impairment, or those with prior neurological or cardiovascular disorders, including a history of stroke.

- **Visual impairment, vision loss, conjunctivitis**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as tranexamic acid is associated with visual disturbances and retinal vascular occlusions. Patients expected to be treated for over 3 months should undergo regular visual acuity and optical coherence assessments. If visual disturbances or ocular symptoms occur, refer the patient to an ophthalmologist for a comprehensive evaluation, including a dilated retinal examination.
