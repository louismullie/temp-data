## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which pharmacologic agent a 45-year-old man with a mechanical mitral valve replacement should receive regularly after surgery, given options including warfarin, amiodarone, ciprofloxacin, and digoxin. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core issue of lifelong anticoagulation for mechanical valves. Then, I should verify the specific INR target for a mechanical mitral valve. Next, I will consider whether any of the other options are indicated routinely. Finally, I will confirm guideline concordance and choose the best answer with supporting references.

> Let me first confirm the fundamental principle: all patients with mechanical heart valves require lifelong anticoagulation with a vitamin K antagonist to prevent valve thrombosis and thromboembolism, and this is a Class I recommendation in contemporary guidelines, so warfarin is indicated here unless contraindicated [^72ebab6e] [^84d1ee27] [^816afd91].

> Wait, let me verify the INR target for a mechanical mitral valve. I initially thought a target of 2.5 might suffice, but hold on, I should double-check because mitral-position mechanical valves carry higher thrombotic risk than aortic-position valves. The ACC/AHA guideline specifies an INR goal of 3.0 with an acceptable range of 2.5–3.5 for mechanical mitral valves, and ACCP similarly recommends a target of 3.0 for mechanical mitral valves, so I should correct my initial thought and align with 3.0 as the target [^9d7c49b5] [^dcf6bac0] [^84d1ee27].

> I need to ensure the other options are not routinely indicated. Amiodarone is an antiarrhythmic and is not indicated for prophylaxis in a patient without arrhythmia; digoxin is for rate control or heart failure management and is not part of routine post–mechanical valve care; ciprofloxacin is an antibiotic and would only be used if there is a specific infection, not for chronic prophylaxis after valve surgery, so these are not appropriate regular therapies in this scenario.

> Hold on, I should verify whether any adjunctive antiplatelet therapy is routinely recommended. ACCP suggests adding low-dose aspirin to VKA in patients with mechanical valves at low bleeding risk, but this is a suggestion rather than a universal requirement, and the question asks for the agent that should be received regularly by all such patients; thus, the mandatory, guideline-directed therapy is VKA anticoagulation with warfarin, with aspirin considered case-by-case rather than as a routine for everyone [^c8e797bf] [^49eb9170].

> Let me reconsider the clinical context to ensure I'm not missing anything. The patient is stable with normal echocardiography, so there is no indication for antiarrhythmics, inotropes, or chronic antibiotics; the only universally required long-term therapy for a mechanical mitral valve is warfarin anticoagulation, which directly addresses the high risk of valve thrombosis and thromboembolism inherent to mechanical prostheses [^72ebab6e] [^84d1ee27].

> Final answer: Anticoagulant therapy with warfarin is the pharmacologic agent that should be received regularly after mechanical mitral valve replacement, with a target INR of 3.0 and an acceptable range of 2.5–3.5, and none of the other listed options are routinely indicated in this setting [^9d7c49b5] [^dcf6bac0] [^72ebab6e].

---

The correct answer is **anticoagulant therapy (warfarin)** [^72ebab6e] because all patients with mechanical heart valves require lifelong vitamin K antagonist therapy to prevent valve thrombosis and thromboembolism [^816afd91]. The target INR for a mechanical mitral valve is **2.5–3.5** [^dcf6bac0], and direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are contraindicated in mechanical valves [^a680ae06]. Antiarrhythmics, antibiotics, and digoxin are not indicated unless there is a specific clinical indication.

---

## Rationale for anticoagulant therapy

Mechanical heart valves are inherently thrombogenic [^1ba7d4a8], and without anticoagulation, patients face a high risk of valve thrombosis and thromboembolic events, including stroke and systemic embolization [^84d1ee27]. Lifelong anticoagulation with a vitamin K antagonist (warfarin) is **mandatory** for all patients with mechanical valves to mitigate these risks [^72ebab6e] [^816afd91].

---

## Recommended anticoagulation regimen

- **Agent**: Warfarin (vitamin K antagonist) [^72ebab6e].
- **Target INR**: 2.5–3.5 for mechanical mitral valves [^dcf6bac0] [^5c14d770].
- **Duration**: Lifelong therapy [^72ebab6e] [^816afd91].
- **Monitoring**: Regular INR checks to maintain therapeutic levels and minimize bleeding risk [^84d1ee27].

---

## Consequences of inadequate anticoagulation

Inadequate anticoagulation in patients with mechanical valves can lead to **valve thrombosis**, causing acute valve obstruction, heart failure, and even death [^1ba7d4a8]. It also increases the risk of thromboembolic events, including stroke and systemic embolization, which can result in significant morbidity and mortality [^84d1ee27].

---

## Why other options are not indicated

- **Anti-arrhythmic therapy (amiodarone)**: Not indicated unless the patient has documented arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation or ventricular arrhythmias.
- **Antibiotic therapy (ciprofloxacin)**: Not indicated for prophylaxis after valve replacement. Antibiotics are only used if there is active infection or specific prophylactic indications (e.g. dental procedures) [^14c96b83].
- **Cardioactive drugs (digoxin)**: Not indicated unless there is heart failure or atrial fibrillation requiring rate control.

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current clinical guidelines from the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) and the European Society of Cardiology/European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery (ESC/EACTS) **strongly recommend lifelong anticoagulation with warfarin** for all patients with mechanical heart valves [^72ebab6e] [^816afd91]. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are contraindicated in patients with mechanical valves due to increased risk of valve thrombosis and thromboembolic events [^a680ae06].

---

## Patient-specific considerations

While warfarin is the standard of care, **individual patient factors** such as age, comorbidities, bleeding risk, and lifestyle should be considered. Regular INR monitoring, patient education, and adherence to therapy are critical to ensure optimal outcomes and minimize complications [^84d1ee27].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

The correct answer is **anticoagulant therapy (warfarin)** [^72ebab6e]. Lifelong anticoagulation with warfarin is essential for patients with mechanical heart valves to prevent valve thrombosis and thromboembolic events [^816afd91]. The target INR for mechanical mitral valves is 2.5–3.5, and regular monitoring is necessary to maintain therapeutic levels and minimize bleeding risk [^dcf6bac0].

Health care–associated PVE was present in 203 of the overall cohort. Seventy-one percent of health care–associated PVE occurred within the first year of valve implantation, and the majority of cases were diagnosed after the early period. Surgery was performed in 272 patients during the index hospitalization. P = 0. 02), S aureus infection, and complications of PVE, including heart failure, is an uncommon but potentially lethal complication of heart valve replacement surgery. Table 1 shows the clinical characteristics of individuals with PVE in comparison to NVIE.

Patients with PVE were significantly older, less likely to use injection drugs, and more likely to have health care–associated infection and intracardiac abscess. In-hospital mortality was significantly higher among PVE cases despite similar rates of complications and surgical intervention. For 384 patients for whom time from valve implantation was available, the microbiology of early and late PVE are also shown. During the index hospitalization, surgical therapy was used in 272 patients with PVE and 879 patients with NVIE. Possible explanations for the time course of health care–associated PVE include greater exposure to health care contact and lack of complete endothelialization of the prosthetic valve early after implantation.

Heart failure, one of the strongest predictors of in-hospital mortality in the current study, has been found to predict 6-month mortality in NVIE40 and may identify a subgroup of patients for whom cardiac surgery is associated with a significant survival benefit. 41 Our previous study demonstrated that hospital survival rates were similar between complicated PVE treated with surgery and uncomplicated PVE after adjustment for those characteristics associated with surgical intervention, 4 but additional studies are needed to define more clearly the role, timing, and effect of surgery in PVE.

Prosthetic valve endocarditis is a catastrophic complication of cardiac valve replacement, associated with high mortality rates. Medical treatment is effective in a few instances of endocarditis involving the leaflets alone in bioprostheses. However, accurate diagnosis, better myocardial protection, and improved surgical strategies have led to better survival in patients undergoing surgery after failed conservative therapy. This comprehensive review addresses various issues involved in the management of this complication.

Infective endocarditis (IE) is an uncommon infection of cardiac valves associated with bacteremia. It increasingly affects elderly patients with chronic disease and artificial cardiac devices. The presentation, however, remains subtle and varied, with nonspecific symptoms ranging from those resembling a mild viral infection to septic shock and multiorgan failure. IE carries potential to cause significant morbidity and mortality through its impact on cardiac function and from embolic complications. Blood cultures prior to antibiotics and obtaining prompt echocardiography are key diagnostic steps, followed by proper selection of empiric antibiotics and, in many cases, collaboration with infectious disease, cardiology, and cardiothoracic surgery specialists.

### Mechanical mitral valve thrombosis secondary to Tinzaparin as an anticoagulation bridging Strategy [^66aaa4aa]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

For patients with mechanical heart valves, oral vitamin K antagonists effectively reduce the risk of valve thrombosis. Bridging strategies that use intravenous unfractionated heparin or subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) are required when reversal of anticoagulation is needed for invasive procedures or bleeding complications. There is limited data comparing anticoagulation efficacy between subtypes of LMWH and dosing regimens in this context. This report describes the case of a 45-year-old man with acute mechanical mitral valve thrombosis and suggests that the use of once daily dosing of subcutaneous tinzaparin may be an inappropriate anticoagulation bridging strategy.

### The changing face of infective endocarditis [^fde4d5b1]. Heart (2006). Low credibility.

Infective endocarditis (IE) is an evolving disease with a persistently high mortality and morbidity, even in the modern era of advanced diagnostic imaging, improved antimicrobial chemotherapy, and potentially curative surgery. Despite these improvements in health care, the incidence of the disease has remained unchanged over the past two decades and may even be increasing. Chronic rheumatic heart disease is now an uncommon antecedent, whereas degenerative valve disease of the elderly, mitral valve prolapse, intravenous drug misuse, preceding valve replacement, and vascular instrumentation have become increasingly common, coinciding with an increase in staphylococcal infections and those caused by fastidious organisms. The current understanding of this difficult condition is reviewed and recent developments in medical and surgical management are updated.

### How did we get here? a historical review and critical analysis of anticoagulation therapy following mechanical valve replacement [^07672838]. Circulation (2019). Medium credibility.

Managing severe valvular heart disease with mechanical valve replacement necessitates lifelong anticoagulation with a vitamin K antagonist. Optimal anticoagulation intensity for patients with mechanical valves remains uncertain; current recommendations are inconsistent across guideline bodies and largely based on expert opinion. In this review, we outline the history of anticoagulation therapy in patients with mechanical heart valves and critically evaluate current antithrombotic guidelines for these patients. We conclude that randomized trials evaluating optimal anticoagulation intensity in patients with mechanical valves are needed, and that future guidelines must better justify antithrombotic treatment recommendations.

### Endocarditis… [^14c96a83]. JAMA Network (2018). Excellent credibility.

Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below. Infective endocarditis is an infection of the inner layer of the heart, usually involving the heart valves. Causes of Infective Endocarditis. Infective endocarditis occurs when a bacterial or fungal pathogen enters the blood and attaches to the inner lining of the heart, usually a heart valve. The organisms that cause the infection can enter blood through the gums or intestines; by health care–related procedures such as intravenous catheter placement, surgery, or hemodialysis; or through the skin because of intravenous drug abuse. People who have artificial heart valves or congenital heart abnormalities or who have had endocarditis in the past have a high risk of developing endocarditis. Symptoms Infective endocarditis causes fever in most but not all patients.

Other symptoms may be fatigue, shortness of breath, swelling of hands or feet, painful lesions on the fingers or toes, and even having a stroke. A doctor might check for a new or worsening heart murmur, heart failure, an enlarged spleen, stroke, or abnormal spots on the hands or feet. Diagnosis A blood sample may be taken to check for pathogens. An echocardiogram may be used to detect infection of the heart valves. Sometimes it may be necessary to pass a scope into the esophagus through the mouth to view the heart using an ultrasound device. Treatment Infective endocarditis is treated with antibiotics that targeted the bacteria or fungus causing the infection. Patients usually receive a long course of these antibiotics, usually 4 to 6 weeks. Some patients require surgical repair or replacement of the infected heart valve, particularly if mechanical complications in the infected valve cause heart problems.

Poor oral hygiene or gum disease increases the risk of bacteria entering the blood and development of endocarditis. Patients who have a high risk of developing endocarditis should make sure to brush their teeth regularly and get regular dental care. At-risk patients also may need to receive antibiotics before they have any kind of procedure that might cause bacteria to get into the bloodstream.

### Medically managed prosthetic valve endocarditis caused by… [^e28d07f7]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Infective endocarditis is associated with morbidity and mortality even when appropriately treated. It can be more complicated to treat when prosthetic material is present, often necessitating surgical revision as well as antimicrobial therapy. Endocarditis caused by gram-negative bacilli is a rare occurrence, with some literature and expert opinion suggesting superior outcomes with combined surgery and antibiotics when a prosthetic valve is involved. In cases where the prosthetic valve is well-functioning and undamaged, or cardiothoracic surgery represents a significant operative risk, it can be unclear how best to proceed. This report documents a case of Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar enteritidis endocarditis of a mechanical mitral valve. The patient was managed with 6weeks of intravenous antibiotics followed by suppressive oral antibiotic therapy. They remain in good health at 24 months.

### 2020 ACC / AHA guideline for the management of patients with valvular heart disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^2633ad21]. Circulation (2021). High credibility.

Infective endocarditis complications and indications for repeat imaging: Heart failure, paravalvular extension, and embolic events represent the 3 most frequent and severe complications of IE and are the 3 main indications for early surgery, which is performed in almost 50% of cases. If signs or symptoms of these complications exist, there should be a very low threshold for repeat imaging; a single negative TEE cannot rule out underlying IE, and a repeat TEE should be performed when persistence of infection is suspected or if complications ensue. Conversely, without clinical deterioration or new signs and symptoms, routine follow-up echocardiography is probably of only limited clinical utility. During therapy, increasing vegetation size is a risk factor for new embolic events, whereas unchanged or reduced vegetation size under therapy may be more difficult to interpret.

### Infective endocarditis: it takes a team [^de80bb7c]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Infective endocarditis (IE) was first described in the 18th century in an era when autopsy was the primary method of diagnosis. Although the diagnosis and treatment of this disease has since markedly improved, IE remains associated with significant mortality and morbidity. The current epidemiology of IE has shifted to affect patients who have significant comorbidities, are frail, inject drugs, or who have underlying structural heart disease and cardiovascular devices, often in the setting of healthcare-related infections. Moreover, the prevalence of IE due to Staphylococcus aureus, a virulent pathogen associated with worse outcomes, has increased.

The multi-disciplinary team-based approach has become the standard of care for patients with complex cardiovascular disease, including IE, which frequently affects multiple organ systems with protean clinical manifestations. Integration of diverse expertise from multiple areas of care ensures that patients with IE receive coordinated, standardized, and comprehensive care especially, particularly given the relatively rare nature of the disease. Owing to limited evidence and wide variability in disease presentation, management decisions are often based upon expert consensus. Endocarditis teams (ET) provide a platform for expert case-by-case discussions, with increased recognition of their importance over the last decade. Several ET models have demonstrated improved outcomes, yet their diversity highlights that there is no one-size-fits-all approach. The aims of this paper are to review the rationale for a multi-disciplinary team-based approach to the diagnosis and management of IE, to highlight steps and components that are essential to successful ET implementation and to suggest methods to increase their adoption.

Case presentation

We report on a 55 year old male patient with a history of severe aortic valve stenosis, ectasia of the aorta ascendens (48 mm) and reduced left ventricular function. He underwent prosthetic valve replacement with a mechanical valved conduit (St. Jude Medical Conduit CAVG 29 mm) in 2003. Anticoagulation was started with phenprocoumon. Implantation of a cardiac pacemaker (Medtronic Kappa KDR 503) due to atrioventricular block III° was necessary five days after initial heart surgery.

The patient presented to the emergency department in 03/2013 with a new sleep-onset weakness of the left arm and difficulties to speak. Emergency cranial computed-tomography (CCT) revealed ischemic brain lesions in the territory of the right middle cerebral artery. Neither atrial fibrillation nor valvular lesions or carotid artery stenoses were detected, when the patient was evaluated for causative mechanisms. Rehabilitation was finally completed with minimal residual neurological symptoms. Five months later, the patient was readmitted with fatigue, febrile temperatures, headache, nausea and progressive left-sided weakness and dysarthria. CCT scans after readmission showed signs of the preceding ischemic stroke in the territory of the right middle cerebral artery and new signs of progressive embolisation in the territory of the left middle cerebral artery with haemorrhage. C-reactive protein (CRP) was now 59 mg/l (ref. < 5 mg/l) and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was 45 mm/h (ref. 0–30 mm/h). Sequentially obtained blood culture samples (5 of 5 sets) were positive for Staphylococcus epidermidis resistant to oxacillin (MRSE) (see Table 1). In line with additional minor DUKE criteria, predisposition, febrile temperatures and septic emboli, the definitive diagnosis of infective prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE) was made. Antiinfective treatment with vancomycin plus rifampicin was started and the patient was transferred to a tertiary university medical center providing immediate facilities for cardiosurgical and neurosurgical interventions. The initial bedside transthoracic echocardiography on admission revealed no signs of valvular masses suggestive for vegetations, a moderate mitral regurgitation was noted. Evaluation via transesophageal echocardiography 48 h later showed a filiforme (7x4mm) mass at the prosthetic aortic valve and a perivalvular dehiscence of the mechanical valved conduit. Fortunately, at this time no surgical intervention was required.

### Management of mechanical prosthetic heart valve thrombosis: JACC review topic of the week [^1ba7d4a8]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Mechanical prosthetic heart valves, though more durable than bioprostheses, are more thrombogenic and require lifelong anticoagulation. Mechanical valve dysfunction can be caused by 4 main phenomena: 1) thrombosis; 2) fibrotic pannus ingrowth; 3) degeneration; and 4) endocarditis. Mechanical valve thrombosis (MVT) is a known complication with clinical presentation ranging from incidental imaging finding to cardiogenic shock. Thus, a high index of suspicion and expedited evaluation are essential. Multimodality imaging, including echocardiography, cine-fluoroscopy, and computed tomography, is commonly used to diagnose MVT and follow treatment response. Although surgery is oftentimes required for obstructive MVT, other guideline-recommended therapies include parenteral anticoagulation and thrombolysis. Transcatheter manipulation of stuck mechanical valve leaflet is another treatment option for those with contraindications to thrombolytic therapy or prohibitive surgical risk or as a bridge to surgery. The optimal strategy depends on degree of valve obstruction and the patient's comorbidities and hemodynamic status on presentation.

Abstract

Infective endocarditis (IE) is a relatively rare but life-threatening systemic infection, which remains associated with high morbidity and mortality. The epidemiology of IE has shifted to involve an increasing numbers of older patients with both cardiovascular and other types of prosthetic devices, multiple comorbid conditions often requiring invasive procedures, increasingly virulent pathogens, in particular Staphylococcus aureus, or that can harbour anti-microbial resistance, and an escalation of injection drug use in many areas of the world. In parallel, advancements in diagnostic and therapeutic options have led to complex strategies in patients' management. Despite these epidemiologic shifts, clinical trials have been rare and most of the evidence guiding IE management derives from expert consensus or analysis of large registries. Because of this, a multi-disciplinary IE team-based approach has been recommended as the standard of care. The aim of this review is to explore the rationale for a multi-disciplinary team-based approach to the management of IE. This approach has proved to be potentially beneficial based on multiple investigations that have evaluated patient outcomes.

### A not very NICE case of endocarditis [^236e28cf]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

A 69-year-old man, previously independent and with a pre-existing metallic aortic valve, presented with a history of fevers, confusion and malaise and was diagnosed with prosthetic valve endocarditis. Blood cultures taken on presentation grew Streptococcus sanguinis and vegetations were confirmed on transoesophageal echocardiogram. He had had a dental procedure 10 days before presentation but had not received prophylactic antibiotics; he had been receiving antibiotic prophylaxis for dental treatment up until the change in NICE guidelines in 2008. He was treated with high dose antibiotics and was referred for cardiothoracic surgery, but developed a cerebrovascular event, thought to be embolic, and deteriorated and died. Given that the patient had a metallic aortic valve and poor dentition, and therefore was at increased risk of infective endocarditis, should the new guidelines have been followed so rigidly, particularly as American and European guidelines still recommend the use of antibiotic prophylaxis in this patient group?

### Current features of infective endocarditis in elderly patients… [^da2bac97]. JAMA Network (2008). Excellent credibility.

Among the acquired predisposing cardiac conditions, mitral regurgitation and nonrheumatic aortic stenosis were significantly more common in elderly IE patients. In contrast, congenital heart disease, mostly bicuspid aortic valve and ventricular or atrial septal defects, was significantly less frequent. Within the 6 months before IE onset, elderly patients reported significantly more often at least 1 invasive procedure. In addition, elderly IE patients were significantly more likely to have a pacemaker or an automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator. Mitral regurgitation was the predominant form of valve dysfunction in elderly IE patients, whereas aortic and tricuspid disease prevailed in younger patients.

Significantly more mitral and less aortic and tricuspid vegetations were found in the elderly patients compared with the younger patients. Elderly patients had lower rates of complications and in particular fewer strokes and significantly less peripheral emboli, despite exclusion of patients with IE on prosthetic devices who underwent long-term anticoagulation. Elderly IE patients underwent cardiac surgery less often than their younger counterparts. Severe embolism, valve regurgitation, and large vegetations less often represented the reason for surgery, and intraoperatively elderly patients showed fewer vegetations or valve perforation. As previously observed, 8, 18 vascular manifestations of IE, such as embolic events, are less common in elderly patients, despite higher rates of mitral valve involvement19 and independent of other variables.

Factors that may account for this phenomenon may include a more widespread use of both antiplatelet and anticoagulant medications and, possibly, a less pronounced acute-phase response, 18 correlating with lower rates of immune-mediated manifestations.

### Bioprosthetic vs mechanical mitral valve replacement for infective endocarditis in patients aged 50 to 69 years [^61624a39]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

Despite the evolution of antimicrobial therapy and sepsis prevention, infections affecting the mitral valves continuously causing significant morbidity and mortality, leading to valvular malfunction, embolism, cerebrovascular events, and congestive heart failure. The surgery of mitral valve endocarditis is primarily determined by disease severity and valvular and annular destruction. For the lesion only limited to valve leaflets, mitral valve repairs is the preferred option since it shows better preservation of left ventricular function and low incidence of prosthesis‐related complications. 13 However, IE with advanced valvular defects and paravalvular abscesses or fistulas require complete excision and MVR with artificial valve prosthesis. 14

The dilemma about prosthesis selection will arise immediately once when patients decide to replace the destructed mitral valve. 15 The choice of valve type is determined by balancing the risk of anticoagulation‐related and thromboembolic complications with mechanical valves vs the risk of structural failure and reoperation with bioprosthetic valves. Since there is no agreement on the optimal valve prosthetic choice in the setting of infective endocarditis, in most cases we need to refer to the consensus guidelines for the management of valvular heart disease. 16, 17, 18 In general, the current guidelines on MVR (such as the American Heart Association (AHA)/American College of Cardiology (ACC) or the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and the European Association for Cardio‐Thoracic Surgery (EACTS) guidelines) recommend using mechanical valve in for patients younger than 50 year and bioprosthesis for those who are older than 70 year. 7, 8, 19 However, the choice of mechanical or bioprosthetic valve in mitral position for patients aged 50 to 69 years is an uncharted territory in current guidelines. 15, 20

### Fulminant thrombosis of mechanical mitral valve prosthesis [^6e5251a2]. Heart (2001). Low credibility.

In patients with prosthetic heart valves non-cardiac surgery may require temporary discontinuation of oral anticoagulation. Although the risk of valve related thromboembolic complications may generally be only slightly increased during the short perioperative period, in the presence of certain risk factors, replacement of oral anticoagulation with heparin is recommended. In the presented patient, unusually fulminant and finally fatal thrombosis of a mechanical mitral valve prosthesis developed within only 48 hours after non-cardiac surgery despite heparin treatment. The thrombosis was triggered by clinical conditions favouring a hypercoagulable state. This report dramatically shows that despite improvements in prosthetic heart valve design and in the management of anticoagulation, thrombosis remains one of the most dangerous complications after valve replacement with a mechanical prosthesis.

Conclusions

There is clear consensus that MDTs should drive the care of patients with IE, despite a paucity of high-quality evidence to guide these recommendations (with most studies at serious or critical risk of bias). The infrequent nature of IE means that clinical decision making should be guided by clinicians who gain and share their experience of the care of these patients. More evidence is needed to guide the development of optimal models of care delivery, clinical training, patient information and follow-up.

### Intracerebral haemorrhage, anticoagulation and mechanical heart valves: what should I do next? [^503df292]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Life-long oral anticoagulant therapy is recommended to all patients with mechanical heart valves to reduce the incidence of thromboembolic events. However, intracerebral haemorrhage is the fatal complication associated with anticoagulation, with an estimated 6-month mortality of 67%. (1) The incidence of cerebral bleeding while on anticoagulation is 0.3–0.7%/year, with as many as 85% of survivors left with permanent neurological deficits. (2) Difficulties in management arise when anticoagulation is temporarily discontinued as mechanical valves, particularly mitral, are exposed to significant thromboembolic and valve dysfunction risk. The decision on when to appropriately restart anticoagulation needs to be balanced with the risk of precipitating further cerebral haemorrhage. There are currently no guidelines on the optimal time to start anticoagulation. We describe a case of the management approach implemented in a patient with a mechanical valve presenting to the emergency department with an acute intracerebral haemorrhage.

Case report

A 50-year-old man presented to our hospital with one month of dyspnea on exertion and lower extremity edema. Two weeks prior to admission, he was hospitalized at another institution with decompensated heart failure, severe mitral regurgitation, and possible pneumonia. He received diuretics and antibiotics and his symptoms improved. He was referred to our hospital to evaluate his mitral valvulopathy.

Past medical history included heart failure due to mitral valve regurgitation, atrial fibrillation, pulmonary thromboembolism, and inflammatory polyarthritis. Two years prior to admission, he underwent mitral valve revision complicated by recurrent mitral regurgitation and new tricuspid regurgitation requiring bioprosthetic mitral valve replacement and tricuspid valve repair. Histopathology of the extracted mitral valve revealed fibrosis, no evidence of endocarditis, and no other findings to suggest a specific diagnosis. Valvular tissue cultures were not obtained.

He complained of arthralgias that were controlled on colchicine and also epigastric abdominal pain. He denied fever, weight loss, or diarrhea. Other medications included carvedilol, furosemide, and warfarin. He had no medication allergies. There was no foreign travel, illicit drug, alcohol, or tobacco use. He was a retired welder.

Physical examination revealed a well-developed, well-nourished man who appeared fatigued in moderate respiratory distress. Temperature 37.3 °C, blood pressure 98/86 mmHg, heart rate 115, respiratory rate 25, and oxygen saturation 95% on 3 L of oxygen via nasal cannula. He had increased jugular venous distension, bilateral basilar crackles, grade III/VI holosystolic murmur in the mitral area, and bilateral lower extremity edema. There were no cutaneous stigmata of endocarditis. The remainder of his exam was normal.

### Large mitral valve aneurysm with infective endocarditis [^17ea873b]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

A 63-year-old man with infective endocarditis (IE) was admitted to our hospital after experiencing acute heart failure. A two-dimensional transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography revealed vegetation attached to both aortic and mitral valves, a very large mitral valve aneurysm, a severe mitral regurgitation jet issuing from a mitral valve perforation and severe aortic regurgitation. Three days after admission, both the aortic and mitral valves were replaced. The patient received antibiotic therapy for 6 weeks postoperatively and recovered with no neurological complications. Although the patient was discharged without recurrence of IE, his transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography showed periprosthetic mitral regurgitation, requiring him to receive close follow-up monitoring. This case report exemplifies the rather unusual, but important, complications of aortic valve IE, and suggests some suitable forms of intervention.

### Treatment of endocarditis: a decade of experience [^75c4e4a6]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Endocarditis represents a small proportion of cardiovascular disease but is associated with high mortality. Previous studies have reported a range of outcomes, and determinants of mortality remain poorly defined.

Methods

The goal of this retrospective study was to identify independent variables for early and late mortality in 364 consecutive patients with endocarditis over a 10-year period.

Results

The mean age of patients was 48.2 years, 35% had a history intravenous drug use, 19.8% were reoperative, and 93% had native valve endocarditis. Fever (68%) and fatigue (36%) were the most common presenting symptoms, and congestive heart failure (52%), embolization (45%), and uncontrolled sepsis (36%) were the most common indications for surgery. Overall survival at discharge, 1, 5, and 10 years was 87%, 76%, 55%, and 31%, respectively. Survival at discharge, 5, and 10 years was 91%, 69%, and 41% for surgical patients and 85%, 60%, and 31% for medically treated patients, respectively. Surgery was associated with improved short-term and long-term survival (p < 0.0.01). Independent predictors of early death were hemodynamic instability (p = 0.013) and age older than 55 years (p < 0.025). Medical treatment (p = 0.005), age older than 55 years (p = 0.032), institution (p < 0.001), New York Heart Association functional class III or IV (p = 0.002), and hemodynamic instability (p = 0.044) were predictive of late death.

Conclusions

Short-term and long-term mortality from endocarditis remains high, although surgically treated patients had improved survival. Differing outcomes from two geographically similar institutions highlight the limitations of extrapolating risk factors between disparate patient populations.

The 2014 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines for valvular heart disease were released to help guide the clinician in caring for patients with this ever more prevalent and complex group of diseases and have been instrumental in providing a foundation of knowledge for the management of patients with valvular heart disease. However, there are many caveats in applying the guidelines to individual patients. As clinicians, we wish to outline important aspects to be considered by other clinicians, including the integration of the echocardiogram with the history and physical examination, recognition of discordant data within an echocardiographic examination, and proper interpretation of the cutoff measurements applied to timing of intervention. Decisions regarding management should be individualized to the institution, particularly when recommending early operation for an asymptomatic patient. Finally, all decisions should be individualized to each patient by not only recognizing specific comorbidities, but also understanding the patient's needs and preferences.

Transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (TEER) is used extensively in patients with symptomatic severe mitral regurgitation and high surgical risk. While prosthetic valve endocarditis is well documented, infective endocarditis (IE) after TEER is a rare occurrence. To date, no study has been conducted on this complication. We report the case of an 85-year-old man who developed IE 3 months after undergoing TEER, and we systematically review 26 previously published cases of this complication. Our review findings indicate that discussion within the heart team is essential for the decision-making process and treatment strategy determination.

Over recent decades, the proportion of bioprosthetic valves employed in younger demographics has risen in the UK. This increase is likely due to the anticoagulation burden associated with mechanical valve implantation. Such coagulopathic adverse events have been demonstrated to increase postoperative readmission rates compared with bioprosthetic mitral prosthesis choice. However, in non-elderly patients, the increased rate of valve degeneration associated with bioprosthetic valves has been demonstrated to increase the requirement for valvular reoperation and subsequently increase operative risk and long-term mortality. Mechanical mitral valve replacement should be considered in patients of age < 65 years without a contraindication to anticoagulation. The choice of valve prosthesis should be determined on a case-by-case basis, considering the associated risks of life-long anticoagulation, the potential requirement of reoperation, and the patient's wishes following extensive counseling. Current data suggest that IE should not influence the choice of prosthetic valve implantation beyond standard patient assessment of age and comorbidities.

WARNING

Cardiac Valvulopathy and Fibrotic Complications

Cardiac Valvulopathy

The use of pergolide has been shown to increase the risk of cardiac valvular disease involving one or more valves. Some patients have required valve replacement, and deaths have been reported. Cases have been reported after exposures to pergolide ranging from several months to several years. The histopathology of explanted valves is similar to that of other drug-induced valvulopathies. Precise risk estimates of pergolide-induced cardiac valvular disease are not available.

Specific risk factors predisposing patients to developing cardiac valvular disease with pergolide have not been identified. Cardiac valvulopathy has been reported with all doses of pergolide; however, available data suggest that the risk may be greater with higher doses. Doses of pergolide above 5 mg/day are not recommended (see DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION).

Pergolide is not recommended for use in patients with a history of cardiac valvulopathy.

Before initiating treatment with pergolide, all patients should undergo a cardiovascular evaluation, including an echocardiogram, to determine whether valvular disease is present and to provide a baseline for subsequent monitoring. Although the risk of disease progression in patients with asymptomatic valvular disease is unknown, pergolide ordinarily should not be initiated if valvulopathy is detected at screening.

ACC/AHA 2020 valvular heart disease — mechanical valve anticoagulation states that all patients with mechanical valves require life-long anticoagulant therapy with a vitamin K antagonist (VKA), and therapy with an oral VKA at an INR goal appropriate for the patient and prosthesis is required to decrease thromboembolism; VKA is protective against valve thrombosis (OR: 0.11; 95% CI: 0.07–0.2) and thromboembolic events (OR: 0.21; 95% CI: 0.16–0.27). It is preferable to specify a single INR target for each patient and to recognize that the acceptable range includes 0.5 INR units on each side of this target, and fluctuations in INR are associated with an increased incidence of complications in patients with prosthetic heart valves.

Valvular heart disease — top take-home messages (items 1–5) state that disease stages in patients with valvular heart disease "should be classified (Stages A, B, C, and D) on the basis of symptoms, valve anatomy, the severity of valve dysfunction, and the response of the ventricle and pulmonary circulation". In evaluation, history and physical examination findings "should be correlated with the results of noninvasive testing (ie, ECG, chest x-ray, transthoracic echocardiogram)", and if discordance exists, clinicians should "consider further noninvasive (computed tomography, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, stress testing) or invasive (transesophageal echocardiography, cardiac catheterization) testing to determine optimal treatment strategy". For patients with valvular heart disease and atrial fibrillation (except those with rheumatic mitral stenosis or a mechanical prosthesis), the anticoagulation decision "with either a vitamin K antagonist or a non–vitamin K antagonist anticoagulant, should be made in a shared decision-making process based on the CHA2DS2-VASc score", and those with rheumatic mitral stenosis or a mechanical prosthesis and atrial fibrillation "should receive oral anticoagulation with a vitamin K antagonist". Patients with severe valvular heart disease being considered for valve intervention "should be evaluated by a multidisciplinary team, with either referral to or consultation with a Primary or Comprehensive Valve Center". For severe aortic stenosis, treatment "with either a transcatheter or surgical valve prosthesis should be based primarily on symptoms or reduced ventricular systolic function", and "earlier intervention may be considered if indicated by results of exercise testing, biomarkers, rapid progression, or the presence of very severe stenosis".

Mechanical heart valves — We recommend early bridging of mechanical valve patients to VKA therapy with unfractionated heparin (IV dosing) or low-molecular-weight heparin. We recommend long-term VKA therapy for all mechanical valves with target INR 2.5 for aortic and 3.0 for mitral or double valve, and in patients with mechanical valves at low bleeding risk, we suggest the addition of low-dose aspirin (50–100 mg/d). In valve repair patients, we suggest aspirin therapy.

Recommendation-specific supportive text for severe primary MR emphasizes mechanism and timing: Primary MR is a mechanical problem of the leaflet coaptation that has only a mechanical solution — that of mitral valve mechanical intervention, and the onset of symptoms that results from severe MR worsens prognosis even when LV function appears to be normal; thus, the onset of symptoms is an indication for prompt mitral valve surgery, and the ideal time for mitral valve surgery is when the patient's LV approaches but has not yet reached the parameters that indicate systolic dysfunction (LVEF ≤ 60% or LVESD ≥ 40 mm), with imaging surveillance used because symptoms do not always coincide with LV dysfunction.

Middle-aged patients (AVR) trade-offs — Uncertainty and debate continue about which type of AVR is appropriate for patients 50 to 65 years of age. The risks of bleeding and thromboembolism with mechanical prostheses are low, especially in compliant patients with appropriate INR monitoring. Several studies have shown a survival advantage with a mechanical prosthesis in this age group; alternatively, large retrospective observational studies have shown similar long-term survival rates in patients 50 to 69 years of age undergoing mechanical versus bioprosthetic valve replacement. In general, patients with mechanical valves experience a higher risk of bleeding caused by anticoagulation, whereas individuals who receive bioprosthetic valves experience a higher rate of reoperation because of structural deterioration of the prosthesis.
