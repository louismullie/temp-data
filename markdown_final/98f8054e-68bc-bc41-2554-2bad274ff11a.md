## Question

Conplications from eczema herpeticum

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the complications of eczema herpeticum. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical entity and baseline risk. Then, I should categorize complications by organ system and severity. Next, I will quantify risks where possible and identify high-risk phenotypes. After that, I should review recurrence and chronicity. Finally, I will integrate prevention and management implications, including how therapies modify risk, and close with a concise synthesis of the most consequential complications.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity and baseline risk so I don't jump to conclusions. Eczema herpeticum is a disseminated herpes simplex virus infection superimposed on atopic dermatitis, with an estimated prevalence around 3% in AD and a mortality historically cited near 10% in severe cases, though contemporary pediatric series show low mortality with prompt therapy, which underscores the importance of early recognition and treatment [^ed78b25a] [^1d7ec89e] [^673a1ec0].

> I will now examine cutaneous complications, since these are most common and often drive morbidity. Secondary bacterial superinfection is frequent, with Staphylococcus aureus identified in roughly 30–47% of hospitalized cases, and can worsen disease, prolong healing, and contribute to scarring; lesions may also evolve to punched-out erosions, hemorrhagic crusting, and confluent ulcerations, particularly on the face and flexural sites, and can resemble impetigo early on, complicating diagnosis and delaying antivirals [^673a1ec0] [^c8529311] [^87d42b08] [^ad468ceb].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about systemic spread. I should confirm the risk of viremia and visceral dissemination. HSV viremia can occur and, in immunocompromised hosts or severe cases, may lead to hepatitis, pneumonitis, or multiorgan involvement; although rare in immunocompetent children, case reports document HSV DNAemia even outside active treatment windows, reinforcing the need for vigilance when systemic symptoms are present [^d50bf3d8] [^4e0d7298].

> Next, I should review neurologic complications, which are among the most feared. HSV encephalitis is a life-threatening complication with substantial morbidity and mortality if unrecognized; patients may present with altered mental status, seizures, or focal deficits, and early antiviral therapy is critical to outcomes, so any neurologic red flags mandate urgent evaluation and intravenous acyclovir [^ad468ceb] [^d50bf3d8].

> I need to check ocular complications carefully because they can be sight-threatening. Herpetic keratitis and keratoconjunctivitis are well-described, with dendritic epithelial defects and corneal scarring risk; ocular involvement is reported in about 10% of pediatric cases in some series, and any eye pain, photophobia, or visual symptoms should prompt urgent ophthalmology involvement and systemic antivirals [^14f02ccf] [^57d15651].

> Let me consider respiratory complications, which, while less common, can be severe. HSV pneumonia has been reported, particularly in disseminated disease or immunocompromised hosts, and should be suspected with dyspnea, hypoxia, or infiltrates on imaging, prompting escalation to intravenous therapy and supportive care [^ad468ceb] [^d50bf3d8].

> I should confirm hematologic and systemic inflammatory complications. Bacteremia and sepsis, including MRSA, occur in a minority but carry significant risk; in a large pediatric cohort, bloodstream infection occurred in about 3.9% and was associated with longer length of stay, and adults with AD have markedly elevated odds of serious cutaneous infections, including eczema herpeticum, highlighting the systemic vulnerability in this population [^673a1ec0] [^698e0028].

> But wait, what about recurrence and chronicity. I need to ensure I capture that risk. Recurrent EH is common, with reports ranging from about 9% within 1 month to 16% over longer follow-up, and prior EH is a strong predictor of repeat episodes; phenotype studies show that patients with EH history have more severe, type 2–skewed AD, higher IgE, eosinophilia, and more S. aureus colonization, all of which plausibly sustain vulnerability to HSV dissemination [^14f02ccf] [^08013f99] [^977cae5a].

> Next, I should review how therapies modify risk, because this affects counseling and prevention. Topical calcineurin inhibitors carry FDA warnings for increased HSV risk, and case reports link tacrolimus to EH, so active HSV should be treated before restarting these agents; conversely, dupilumab reduces EH risk in pooled analyses, likely via restoration of barrier function and dampening of type 2 inflammation, and is preferred in patients with prior EH when systemic therapy is indicated; JAK inhibitors increase HSV events, and although EH rates are low, vigilance and prophylaxis are reasonable in high-risk patients with frequent HSV recurrences [^ee0b0e12] [^6249bdf0] [^886f0bdb] [^db5753da] [^886f0bdb] [^68d9baee].

> Hold on, I should verify management-linked outcomes that reflect complication burden. Delayed initiation of acyclovir is consistently associated with longer hospitalization in children with EH, and early systemic antivirals are recommended by multiple guidelines; empiric antibiotics do not shorten stay unless there is proven bacterial coinfection, reinforcing the need to diagnose and treat HSV promptly while reserving antibiotics for confirmed bacterial disease [^673a1ec0] [^57d15651] [^420c98ed] [^9b60c2fe].

> Let me synthesize the most consequential complications so I don't miss the forest for the trees. The most clinically significant complications of eczema herpeticum are secondary bacterial superinfection, HSV viremia with potential visceral dissemination, HSV encephalitis, herpetic keratitis and keratoconjunctivitis, HSV pneumonia, bacteremia and sepsis, and high recurrence rates with chronic AD morbidity; early recognition and immediate systemic antivirals are the cornerstone of preventing these sequelae, and risk stratification for recurrence should guide long-term AD management choices [^ad468ceb] [^d50bf3d8] [^673a1ec0] [^2ffdaae9].

Eczema herpeticum is a **disseminated HSV infection** in atopic dermatitis that can cause **life-threatening complications** if not treated promptly [^ed78b25a]. The most serious complications include **secondary bacterial infection** (notably MRSA) [^c8529311], **HSV viremia with systemic dissemination** (hepatitis, pneumonia, encephalitis) [^4e0d7298], and **ocular involvement** (keratitis, conjunctivitis, vision loss) [^14f02ccf] [^e4809208]. Other risks include **scarring, permanent skin changes, and recurrence** [^14f02ccf]; mortality is rare but can reach 10% in severe or untreated cases [^1d7ec89e]. Early recognition and **immediate systemic acyclovir** are critical to reduce morbidity and mortality [^673a1ec0] [^57d15651].

---

## Cutaneous complications

- **Secondary bacterial infection**: Commonly Staphylococcus aureus (including MRSA) [^c8529311], causing impetiginization, cellulitis, abscesses, and sepsis [^notfound].

- **Scarring and pigmentary changes**: Disseminated vesicles and erosions can heal with scarring, hypopigmentation, or hyperpigmentation, especially on the face and neck [^notfound].

- **Chronic skin changes**: Recurrent EH can cause lichenification, atrophy, and chronic pruritus, worsening AD control [^notfound].

---

## Systemic complications

- **HSV viremia and dissemination**: HSV can spread hematogenously to viscera, causing hepatitis, pneumonia, and encephalitis, particularly in immunocompromised hosts [^4e0d7298] [^ad468ceb].

- **Encephalitis**: A rare but severe complication with neurological sequelae or death if untreated [^ad468ceb].

- **Sepsis**: Secondary bacterial sepsis can occur, especially with MRSA or Gram-negative organisms [^notfound].

---

## Ocular complications

Ocular complications include **keratitis and conjunctivitis**, which can cause corneal scarring, vision loss, or blindness if not treated promptly [^14f02ccf] [^e4809208]. Uveitis and retinitis are rare but serious complications that can threaten vision [^notfound].

---

## Recurrence and chronicity

Recurrence is common, with **repeat episodes in 16% of patients** and early recurrence within 1 month in 8.9% [^14f02ccf]. Chronic AD is often worsened by repeated EH flares, leading to persistent inflammation and barrier dysfunction [^notfound].

---

## Mortality

Mortality is rare but can reach **up to 10% in severe or untreated cases**, particularly with systemic dissemination or encephalitis [^1d7ec89e] [^ece42320].

---

## Factors influencing severity and complications

Severity of AD correlates with higher risk of **severe EH and complications** [^08013f99]. Immunocompromised status increases the risk of dissemination and severe outcomes [^4e0d7298]. Delayed antiviral therapy is associated with longer hospitalization and worse outcomes [^673a1ec0].

---

## Prevention and management strategies

- **Early recognition and prompt antiviral therapy**: Immediate systemic acyclovir or valacyclovir reduces morbidity and mortality [^573a1ec0] [^57d15651].

- **Control of underlying AD**: Effective topical and systemic AD therapy reduces EH risk and severity [^09a69469] [^977cae5a].

- **Monitoring for complications**: Regular assessment for bacterial coinfection, ocular involvement, and systemic symptoms is essential [^87d42b08].

---

Eczema herpeticum can cause **severe cutaneous, systemic, and ocular complications**, with mortality up to 10% if untreated [^1d7ec89e]. Early diagnosis and **immediate systemic antiviral therapy** are critical to prevent these outcomes [^573a1ec0].

Eczema herpeticum is an easily missed entity most commonly seen in the pediatric population and carries the risk of systemic compromise and a 10% mortality rate. Clinicians should maintain high clinical suspicion when encountering children or young adults with a history of atopic dermatitis or other erosive dermatoses and who present with vesicular lesions, punched-out erosions, and systemic symptoms. We present 3 severe cases of eczema herpeticum that were potentially overlooked and demonstrate the need for elevated awareness to avoid potential pitfalls.

### The infectious complications of atopic dermatitis [^10a5ed47]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that is complicated by an increased risk for skin and systemic infections. Preventive therapy for AD is based on skin barrier improvement and anti-inflammatory treatments, whereas overt skin and systemic infections require antibiotics or antiviral treatments. This review updates the pathophysiology, diagnosis, management, controversy of antibiotic use, and potential treatments of infectious complications of AD.

Data Sources

Published literature obtained through PubMed database searches and clinical pictures.

Study Selections

Studies relevant to the mechanisms, diagnosis, management, and potential therapy of infectious complications of AD.

Results

Skin barrier defects, type 2 inflammation, Staphylococcusaureus colonization, and cutaneous dysbiosis are the major predisposing factors for the increased infections in AD. Although overt infections require antibiotics, the use of antibiotics in AD exacerbation remains controversial.

Conclusion

Infectious complications are a comorbidity of AD. Although not common, systemic bacterial infections and eczema herpeticum can be life-threatening. Preventive therapy of infections in AD emphasizes skin barrier improvement and anti-inflammatory therapy. The use of antibiotics in AD exacerbation requires further studies.

Eczema herpeticatum is well known as a complication associated with atopic dermatitis. We previously reported 2 cases that developed in adult patients during treatment of their atopic dermatitis with tacrolimus ointment. 1 In a 1-year open study in adult patients with atopic dermatitis who were treated with tacrolimus ointment, eczema herpeticatum was observed at low frequencies, but the data were insufficient to establish a causal relationship. 2 Nevertheless, prevention is important, as the complication is potentially serious and may compromise a promising treatment alternative in a patient with atopic dermatitis.

### Eczema herpeticum: clinical and pathophysiological aspects [^ed78b25a]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is the most common chronic inflammatory skin disease in the world. AD is a complex pathology mainly characterized by an impaired skin barrier, immune response dysfunction, and unbalanced skin microbiota. Moreover, AD patients exhibit an increased risk of developing bacterial and viral infections. One of the most current, and potentially life-threatening, viral infection is caused by herpes simplex virus (HSV), which occurs in about 3% of AD patients under the name of eczema herpeticum (EH). Following a first part dedicated to the clinical features, virological diagnosis, and current treatments of EH, this review will focus on the description of the pathophysiology and, more particularly, the presently known predisposing factors to herpetic complications in AD patients. These factors include those related to impairment of the skin barrier such as deficit in filaggrin and anomalies in tight and adherens junctions. In addition, low production of the antimicrobial peptides cathelicidin LL-37 and human β-defensins; overexpression of cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-4, IL-13, IL-25, IL-33, and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP); or downregulation of type I to III interferons as well as defect in functions of immune cells such as dendritic, natural killer, and regulatory T cells have been involved. Otherwise, genetic polymorphisms and AD topical calcineurin inhibitor treatments have been associated with an increased risk of EH. Finally, dysbiosis of skin microbiota characterized in AD patients by Staphylococcus aureus colonization and toxin secretion, such as α-toxin, has been described as promoting HSV replication and could therefore contribute to EH.

### Algorithms in allergy: diagnosis and treatment of atopic dermatitis complicated by eczema herpeticum [^ad468ceb]. Allergy (2025). Medium credibility.

Eczema herpeticum (EH), first described by Moritz Kaposi in 1887 and therefore also known as Kaposi's varicelliform eruption, is a severe disseminated herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection primarily affecting individuals with atopic dermatitis (AD). EH can lead to significant morbidity and potentially life‐threatening complications such as encephalitis, pneumonia, and bacterial superinfection of the skin lesions. Early diagnosis and prompt management are critical. Although EH is considered a clinically relevant complication in patients with moderate‐to‐severe AD, robust global epidemiological data are lacking. Prevalence estimates are currently limited to national cohort studies, such as the TREATgermany registry, which reported a prevalence of EH in approximately 22% of patients with moderate‐to‐severe AD.

EH typically manifests with widespread, non‐grouped vesicular eruptions and/or erosions on eczematous or, more rarely, on unaffected skin of AD patients. Accompanying systemic symptoms often include fever, malaise, and lymphadenopathy. Secondary bacterial skin infections may further complicate the clinical picture.

Patients at highest risk are those with moderate‐to‐severe AD, which is also equivalent to insufficiently treated AD, and, particularly, patients with early onset of AD, allergic comorbidities, and/or a history of recurrent HSV infections. Predisposing factors contributing to a disruption of skin barrier function include filaggrin loss‐of‐function mutations, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in specific genes including, for instance, Claudin‐1, TSLP, and COL23A1, and type 2 immune polarization, which suppresses antiviral responses, notably interferon‐γ production. These are risk factors for increased susceptibility in a subset of AD patients culminating in the clinical presentation of recurrent EH, which is reported by 54.9% of EH patients. Complications of EH include encephalitis, herpes keratitis, erythema multiforme, and HSV pneumonia and, as mentioned above, secondary bacterial infection of EH lesions. According to the current guidelines, awareness on both sides, the treating physicians and the patients, for example, supported by participation in therapeutic patient education programs, is a prerequisite for sufficient treatment for the earliest possible intervention to further prevent morbidity and improve outcomes in affected patients.

### The clinical spectrum and therapeutic challenge of eczema herpeticum [^6867aa63]. Pediatric Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

We present 5 cases of eczema herpeticum in patients with severe recalcitrant atopic dermatitis to illustrate the range of possible clinical findings and supporting laboratory data that can obscure the diagnosis and complicate treatment. Major issues include: the need for aggressive laboratory evaluation (molecular diagnostics, viral cultures, skin biopsy, serology); the possibility of recurrent or chronic infection; the value of empiric antiviral therapy; the possibility of infection with thymidine-kinase resistant strains; and the importance of achieving control over the dermatitis with nonmyelosuppressive immunomodulating agents such as intravenous immunoglobulin or interferon gamma for dermatitis that requires systemic treatment.

FIGURE 1
Diagnostic Criteria and Treatment Algorithm for Eczema herpeticum. AD, Atopic dermatitis; EH, Eczema herpeticum; GFR, Glomerular Filtration Rate; i.v. intravenous; JAK, Januskinase; p.o. per os; TID, Three times a day.

The management of EH involves both systemic antiviral and topical antiseptic treatment and further supportive care depending on the overall severity and complications. While mild EH can be defined as circumscribed vesicular eruptions on controlled AD lesions, moderate‐to‐severe EH would be seen as disseminated EH eruptions on uncontrolled AD lesions, potentially combined with further severity criteria such as presence at > 1 body region, clinical or laboratory signs for systemic inflammation such as fever, malaise, lymphadenopathy, or laboratory signs of organ dysfunction, and neurological symptoms including changes in consciousness, confusion, or neck stiffness indicating meningitis and encephalitis. These indicators also serve as criteria for hospitalization. An antiviral therapy for moderate/severe EH consists of intravenous acyclovir (5–10 mg/kg, three times daily) for 7 days, adjusted for renal function. For mild EH, oral valacyclovir (1 g, three times daily) or acyclovir applied in a dosage as used for the indication of herpes zoster are viable alternatives. Higher bioavailability of oral valacyclovir compared to oral acyclovir should be taken into account. Acyclovir‐resistant HSV strains can be treated intravenously with foscarnet (dosage for adults: 40 mg/kg TID [three times a day]). Additionally, novel drugs, such as pritelivir, a helicase‐primase inhibitor, are currently being tested in clinical trials, particularly for the treatment of acyclovir‐resistant HSV lesions. Adjunctive care includes treatment of secondary bacterial infections with topical disinfection treatment combined with systemic antibiotics when indicated. While topical corticosteroids in addition to valacyclovir have demonstrated potential faster healing in localized HSV infections in AD patients, there is currently no evidence supporting their efficacy in the management of EH. While no specific follow‐up after successful treatment of an EH episode is suggested, patients should be thoroughly educated about the risk of recurrent EH and the importance of consistent and effective management of their underlying AD.

### Viral infections in atopic dermatitis: pathogenic aspects and clinical management [^de49c7d1]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2003). Low credibility.

A number of different widespread and disseminated viral infections can occur in patients with atopic dermatitis. Eczema molluscatum is troublesome but not dangerous. Although eczema vaccinatum is rare, it is life-threatening and of increased concern as smallpox vaccinations are reintroduced as a response to possible bioterrorism. There is little information on the course of smallpox itself in atopic dermatitis. Eczema herpeticum is the most common member of this group; recent advances in understanding its pathogenesis might contribute to a more successful management of this serious complication.

### American Academy of Dermatology guidelines: awareness of comorbidities associated with atopic dermatitis in adults [^09a69469]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2022). High credibility.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) in adults — skin infections include staphylococcal skin infections that are well known and included in some AD diagnostic criteria; herpes superinfection (eczema herpeticum) is a more severe complication, and a United Kingdom cohort found HSV infections to be more than twice as common among people with AD compared to general population controls; United States hospitalization data show AD associated with serious cutaneous infections (OR, 4.62; 95% CI, 4.51–4.74); bacterial skin infections and eczema herpeticum are more likely with poorly controlled dermatitis, and successful treatment may decrease their incidence.

### Inpatient management of atopic dermatitis [^679b34d7]. Dermatologic Therapy (2011). Low credibility.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common chronic inflammatory skin disease that is generally managed on an outpatient basis. However, a significant percentage of patients may develop complications severe enough to require inpatient treatment. The most common complications of AD that may require hospital admission include erythroderma, eczema herpeticum, and systemic bacterial infection. Hospital admission can also be useful for chronic and severe disease that has not responded to standard therapy or in situations where nonadherence is suspected as the cause of treatment failure. In these cases, inpatient treatment can offer an opportunity for caretaker education and allow for an objective evaluation of a patient's response to a structured treatment plan. This article will review the indications for inpatient management of AD and the therapies that can be used to acutely manage severe disease and associated complications.

### Outpatient and inpatient management of infants and Children with eczema herpeticum diagnosed in the emergency department [^617cd50f]. Pediatric Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

There are no universally established guidelines for when pediatric EH warrants hospitalization or intravenous (IV) acyclovir over oral therapy. To address this lack of consensus, this study aimed to describe outcomes of outpatient oral acyclovir treatment in pediatric EH cases, including rates of disease exacerbation, hospitalizations, and complications.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective cohort review of pediatric patients under age 7 diagnosed with EH who presented to the pediatric emergency department (ED) between January 1, 2008, and December 31, 2022. Cases were identified via electronic medical record (EMR) query using ICD-9/ICD-10 diagnosis codes for EH, 054.0 and B00.0, respectively. All encounters were manually reviewed to confirm diagnosis, assess disease severity, identify complications, and document treatment. The primary outcome was clinical deterioration (e.g., return visits, hospitalization, or new complications). Secondary outcomes included length of stay and treatment modality. Descriptive statistics and subgroup comparisons were performed to assess associations with disposition.

Results

A total of 97 encounters among 87 unique patients were identified. Mean age was 2.05years. Of 27 patients discharged from the ED, only one returned for hospitalization due to EH. Among 70 hospitalized patients, no intensive care, resuscitation, or deaths occurred. Hospitalization was more common in patients with more severe skin findings, concurrent cellulitis, and younger age. No systemic complications or keratitis were observed.

Conclusion

In this cohort, oral acyclovir outpatient management was not followed by disease progression or serious complications. These findings support that some mild EH cases may be managed without hospitalization, but further prospective studies are needed.

### Recurrent herpes simplex infection in multiple locations in an otherwise healthy boy [^f3b52980]. Pediatric Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

An 8-year-old boy developed vesicular lesions on the skin in different parts of the body, occurring four to six times a year. He had a history of eczema herpeticum as a young child. We confirmed a diagnosis of multifocal herpes simplex infection, and hypothesize that this was a result of his previous eczema herpeticum, an unusual complication, in an otherwise healthy and immunocompetent child.

4.2.3 Eczema herpeticum

Eczema herpeticum (EH) is a life‐threatening viral infection, which occurs acutely and is due to HSV in patients with a history of AD. Nearly a third of children who are hospitalized for AD infectious complications were related to EH. It can manifest with skin pruritus or pain and presence of vesicles, punched‐out erosions, or haemorrhagic crusts that can become more extensive. A local skin infection may progress to disseminated vesicles with skin breakdown. Systemic EH infection may present with fever, malaise, viremia, and complications including kerato‐conjunctivitis, encephalitis, and septic shock. Patients with AD who develop EH tend to have more severe AD, earlier‐onset AD, high total serum immunoglobulin E/peripheral eosinophils, and presence of other atopic diseases such as food allergies and asthma, as compared to their AD counterparts without EH.

It may be confused with impetigo, especially in patients with a history of severe AD (EH incognito) or in the early stages with AD itself. Bacterial positivity on skin culture does not exclude EH. The diagnosis can be confirmed by PCR or Tzank smear.

4.2.4 Eczema coxsackium

Coxsackium eczema (EC) is due to coxsackievirus A6 and frequently presents as EH‐like with a greater prevalence of haemorrhagic vesicles over dermatitis, thus casting diagnostic doubt with AD, which is often associated. Some patients with EC may also have symptoms of the hand‐foot‐mouth disease, such as oral sores and papules involving hands and feet. Other possible symptoms include fever, sore throat, and poor appetite.EC should be considered also as a differential diagnosis for EH because it can present with extensive vesicles and skin erosion. However, contrast to EH, EC is not life‐threatening and can be managed with standard AD treatments. The diagnosis is supported by PCR.

4.2.5 Viral exanthem

Viral exanthems (e.g. hand‐foot and mouth disease, unilateral laterothoracic exanthema, Gianotti‐Crosti syndrome) are a heterogeneous group of disorders with cutaneous manifestations that may occasionally resemble AD. However, the sudden, symmetrical mode of onset with small, well‐demarcated plaques allow them to be distinguished from AD, in addition to the presence of other systemic symptoms.

### Recurrent herpes labialis in the pediatric population: prevalence, therapeutic studies, and associated complications [^3a0e466a]. Pediatric Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Recurrent herpes labialis (RHL) is an incredibly common condition, though the medical literature evaluating pediatric aspects is limited. This paper assesses prevalence and therapeutic studies of pediatric RHL as well as disease complications. A comprehensive literature search of English-language citations based on PubMed queries of selected terms was performed, with exclusion if methodology was not discussed, or if studies had 10 or fewer patients. RHL prevalence in pediatrics has been assessed by measures of point and periodic prevalence, though methodologic limitations may under- or over-estimate the true prevalence of RHL. Studies have been conducted to evaluate therapeutic safety, tolerability, and efficacy of antivirals in the pediatric population. Pediatric RHL point prevalence ranges from 0.72% to 5.2% depending on the population study and the methodologies used. Pediatric RHL carries a significant public health burden and is often implicated in patients with eczema herpeticum, erythema multiforme, reactive infectious mucositis eruptions, and hypersensitivity reactions. There are few studies that evaluate the rates of occurrence of these sequelae associated with pediatric RHL.

### Fifteen-minute consultation: eczema herpeticum in a child [^7c3410e1]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2015). Low credibility.

Eczema herpeticum (EH) occurs when there is secondary skin infection with herpes simplex virus in an atopic patient. The patient may not have unusually severe or active eczema. It is thought that the abnormal skin barrier function predisposes to infection, which can spread rapidly. Viraemia and secondary septicaemia can occur, and the condition can be life-threatening. The first episode of herpes infection is usually the worst and requires systemic treatment. Early recognition is vital. The presentation may be difficult to distinguish from secondary bacterial infection, which is common in eczema. A useful clinical clue is the presence of many very similar shaped and sized eroded lesions. Intact blisters may not be seen due to scratching. A rapid deterioration in eczema in a child who is systemically unwell should prompt consideration of EH.

### Characterization of children with recurrent eczema herpeticum and response to treatment with interferon-gamma [^2c4476ce]. Pediatric Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Background/Objectives

Interferon gamma (IFN-γ) has been used treat severe atopic dermatitis, with equivocal results. Recurrent eczema herpeticum is an underappreciated, therapeutically challenging complication of severe atopic dermatitis. Defects in IFN-γ and other cytokine pathways have been identified in individuals with confirmed eczema herpeticum. This suggests possible benefit from IFN-γ treatment for confirmed eczema herpeticum. The objective of the current study was to evaluate immunologic and microbial parameters and response to IFN-γ treatment in children with confirmed eczema herpeticum.

Methods

We performed a retrospective review of medical records from eight children with confirmed eczema herpeticum and two children with severe atopic dermatitis without a history of eczema herpeticum treated with subcutaneous IFN-γ.

Results

Our cohort of children with confirmed eczema herpeticum was predominantly male and had high total serum immunoglobulin E, evidence of insufficient toll-like receptor responses, and streptococcal skin and pharyngeal colonization. The duration of IFN-γ administration was 4.5–25 months. Five children had initial control and then relapse. Three had interval flares. Two had no improvement. Injections were well tolerated, without significant adverse effects. Treatment was associated with an increase in total immunoglobulin E. Poor adherence complicated therapy in five patients. All 10 discontinued IFN-γ for poor perceived efficacy.

Conclusion

Children with confirmed eczema herpeticum have evidence of impaired innate and adaptive immunity. IFN-γ did not result in dramatic improvement in either subset. Specific evaluation for IFN-γ production, function, or receptor defects may help predict response.

### Infections in patients with atopic dermatitis and the influence of treatment [^e62dcb7c]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Patients with AD are at increased risk of developing skin infections due to impaired skin barrier function and a dysregulated immune system; extracutaneous and systemic infections may also represent a concern. Recurrent bacterial infections can favour disease chronicisation and cause disease flares with significant morbidity, and possible mortality (in the case of eczema herpeticum), in patients with AD. For the management of infections in patients with AD, it is important to identify and treat the underlying infection, optimise AD treatment to improve skin barrier function and immune system regulation and implement infection prevention strategies. The risk of infection should also be considered when selecting topical or systemic immunosuppressive therapies, as some of these agents can increase the risk of viral infections.

### Eczema herpeticum in atopic dermatitis [^977cae5a]. Allergy (2021). Medium credibility.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is one of the most common chronic inflammatory skin diseases leading to pruritic skin lesions. A subset of AD patients exhibits a disseminated severe HSV infection called eczema herpeticum (EH) that can cause life-threatening complications. This review gives an overview of the clinical picture, and characteristics of the patients as well as the diagnosis and therapy of EH. A special focus lies on the pathophysiological hallmarks identified so far that predispose for EH. This aspect covers genetic aberrations, immunological changes, and environmental influences displaying a complex multifactorial situation, which is not completely understood. Type 2 skewing of virus-specific T cells in ADEH + patients has been implicated in immune profile abnormalities, along with impaired functions of dendritic cells and natural killer cells. Furthermore, aberrations in interferon pathway-related genes such as IFNG and IFNGR1 have been identified to increase the risk of EH. IL-4, IL-25, and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) are overexpressed in EH, whereas antimicrobial peptides like human β-defensins and LL-37 are reduced. Concerning the epidermal barrier, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in skin barrier proteins such as filaggrin were identified in ADEH + patients. A dysbalance of the skin microbiome also contributes to EH due to an increase of Staphylococcus aureus, which provides a supporting role to the viral infection via secreted toxins such as α-toxin. The risk of EH is reduced in AD patients treated with dupilumab. Further research is needed to identify and specifically target risk factors for EH in AD patients.

### Replicated methylation changes associated with eczema herpeticum and allergic response [^e6254c9b]. Clinical Epigenetics (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Atopic dermatitis (AD), a complex chronic skin disease, affects up to 30% of children. It often persists into adulthood. A primary symptom of AD is incessant pruritus which typically has an intermittent course with flares and remissions. Eczema herpeticum (EH) is a rare but serious complication of AD. The primary predisposing factor for EH is HSV-1 exposure (in 2005–2010, 54% of persons in the USA aged 14–49 had HSV-1 infection). In spite of HSV-1 infection being the primary environmental risk factor in the development of EH, only a small subset (less than 3%) of patients with AD have a history of EH (ADEH+). ADEH+ patients typically represent the severe end of the disease spectrum, with more severe skin disease. They have reduced interferon responses and are highly allergic with increased serum tIgE levels and eosinophilia. Yet, the factors contributing to ADEH+ are unclear. To date, there is considerable evidence for genetic determinants associated with viral dissemination and outcomes associated specifically with risk of ADEH+ and disease severity.

DNA methylation, an epigenetic mechanism by which gene expression is regulated without alterations in nucleotide sequence, has been shown to contribute to the risk of complex diseases, notably autoimmune disorders and diseases of inflammation. Risk of AD has been shown to be correlated with changes in genomic DNA methylation patterns in lesional versus non-lesional AD skin. However, no study has examined patterns of methylation specific to ADEH+. Common contributors to both ADEH− and ADEH+ are skin barrier abnormalities and immune dysregulation while risk factors for ADEH+ are early-onset and persistent severe AD. In spite of these known risks, the pathophysiology of ADEH+ still is not completely understood. In addition to identifying a methylation-specific signature for ADEH+, a goal of the current study was to determine whether an easily accessible tissue such as whole blood can be the source of a biomarker which might facilitate the early diagnosis of patients with AD prone to disseminated viral infections, and whether or not methylation changes in the blood can distinguish between ADEH+ and ADEH−.

### Algorithms in allergy: diagnosis and treatment of atopic dermatitis complicated by eczema herpeticum [^886f0bdb]. Allergy (2025). Medium credibility.

In patients with a history of EH the indication for systemic treatment for AD requires careful evaluation of risks and benefits (Figure 2). Dupilumab, an interleukin‐4 receptor antagonist, has proven efficacy in reducing EH risk by enhancing epidermal barrier integrity and counteracting type 2 inflammation. Whether this is also applicable to IL‐13 inhibitors (tralokinumab, lebrikizumab) has not yet been investigated. Therefore, the use of dupilumab (or other type 2 directed biologics) is preferred for biologic‐naïve individuals with moderate‐to‐severe AD and EH in the past, especially for those with recurrent EH. Conversely, JAK inhibitors (JAKi), including selective JAK1/2i, should be used with caution due to their potential to increase the risk for virus reactivation, particularly including HSV. For EH‐high‐risk patients requiring JAK inhibitors or conventional systemic immunosuppression, a detailed assessment of recurrent HSV reactivation prior to treatment is essential. In case of recurrent HSV infections in the patient's history (≥ 3–6×/year), stand‐by antiviral therapies (e.g. valacyclovir 2 g BID [twice‐daily] for 1 day) can be considered as part of an integrated management plan. In case of insufficient HSV control, prophylactic treatment with valacyclovir 500 mg per day concomitantly to JAKi treatment over 6–12 months can be given in accordance the approved labeling. Close monitoring and thorough patient education are crucial to reducing recurrence and ensuring optimal outcomes.

Systemic Treatment of patients with atopic dermatitis and a history of Eczema herpeticum (EH). AD, Atopic dermatitis; EH, Eczema herpeticum; JAKi, Januskinase inhibitor; OD, once daily; p.o. per os; TID, Three times a day.

EH represents a critical complication of AD, requiring rapid diagnosis and immediate intervention. Advances such as biologics like dupilumab offer significant potential to mitigate EH risk in predisposed AD populations. Further research should focus on identifying biomarkers for high‐risk individuals that would profit from preventive, targeted therapy.

### Infections in patients with atopic dermatitis and the influence of treatment [^cfec6b9e]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a T helper 2-mediated chronic inflammatory skin disease that affects children and adults. Patients with AD are prone to recurrent infections of the skin and other organs, which can severely worsen the disease course. This review summarises the current evidence on the aetiology, pathogenesis, treatment and prevention of infections in patients with AD. PubMed was searched for English-language research articles, systematic reviews, meta-analyses and guidelines published until February 2023 using the key term "atopic dermatitis" and terms relevant to infections. Patients with AD have an increased risk of bacterial, viral and fungal infections of the skin, mainly due to impaired barrier function, altered immune response and frequent scratching. The most common pathogens are Staphylococcus aureus and herpes simplex virus, which can cause impetigo, folliculitis, abscesses, eczema herpeticum and other complications. They also appear to increase susceptibility to systemic infections, including respiratory and urinary tract infections and sepsis. Certain systemic treatments for AD, such as mycophenolate mofetil and Janus kinase inhibitors, increase the risk of viral infections. Prevention and treatment of recurrent infections in patients with AD require a multifaceted approach that includes topical and systemic antimicrobials, skin care and effective control of AD symptoms (to break the itch-scratch cycle). Preventing and limiting the development of infections are important considerations in choosing an AD treatment.

### The genetics of eczema herpeticum [^363682bf]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

Eczema herpeticum (EH) is a viral skin infection caused by herpes simplex virus (HSV) superimposed on eczematous skin lesions in atopic dermatitis (AD). Though the pathogenesis of EH has yet to be fully elucidated, the fact that EH is relatively rare despite a majority of adults showing serologic evidence of HSV exposure points to a genetic component predisposing to the disease. A number of genetic variants have been isolated in EH which may help distinguish a subgroup of patients susceptible to developing the condition. These unique genetic characteristics include deficiencies in skin barrier function and hydration, as well as at the level of the immune system. In this review, we summarize the genetic findings associated with EH identified to date. Isolating genetic markers in EH will be instrumental in stratifying patients at risk for EH and will have significant implications in the development and tailoring of targeted therapies.

### Pathological case of the month… [^ece42320]. JAMA Network (1999). Excellent credibility.

Eczema herpeticum, also known by its eponym Kaposi varicelliform eruption, is a potentially fatal, widespread cutaneous infection caused by human herpesvirus 1. Eczema herpeticum is characterized clinically by clusters of umbilicated vesicles and eventually pustules in areas of previously abnormal skin. The most common predisposing cutaneous disorder is atopic dermatitis. Other less commonly reported risk factors for developing EH include Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, Darier disease, pemphigus foliaceus, benign familial chronic pemphigus, and chronic irritant contact dermatitis. 1 Cases that arise from healing second-degree burns, 2 autografted skin, 3 and staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome4 have been reported. Abnormal skin is the virus' portal of entry, but the eruption rapidly spreads to previously normal and uninvolved skin. The vesicles evolve into pustules and then the classic punched out erosions, which may become confluent with subsequent hemorrhagic crusting.

Patients are typically febrile and appear to have had a toxic reaction. 5 Visceral dissemination of HHV-1 and subsequent mortality have been estimated at 1% to 9%. 6 Secondary bacterial infection often complicates the course of illness and contributes to morbidity and mortality. The most common secondary pathogen is Staphylococcus aureus.
5. Herein, we report the occurrence of EH 5 days after vaccination with a live, attenuated varicella vaccine. Initial evaluations raised concern whether the clinical findings were related to this. Results of the Tzanck test revealed multinucleated giant cells; however, this test cannot distinguish between HHV-1 or varicella-zoster infection. The HHV-1 infection was ultimately confirmed by conducting a viral culture. Bacterial cultures taken from the skin grew S aureus. Our patient promptly recovered after a parenteral injection of acyclovir and antistaphylococcal therapy.

Pediatric patients with chronic cutaneous disorders are at increased risk of developing severe varicella infections, and active immunization with the varicella vaccine is not contraindicated. 12 A high clinical suspicion for EH should be maintained in children with atopic dermatitis who have a vesicular eruption, even in the setting of recent varicella vaccination.

### Eczema vaccinatum [^838a866b]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Eczema vaccinatum (EV) is a complication of smallpox vaccination that can occur in persons with eczema/atopic dermatitis (AD), in which vaccinia virus disseminates to cause an extensive rash and systemic illness. Because persons with eczema are deferred from vaccination, only a single, accidentally transmitted case of EV has been described in the medical literature since military vaccination was resumed in the United States in 2002. To enhance understanding of EV, we review its history during the era of universal vaccination and discuss its relationship to complications in persons with other diseases or injuries of the skin. We then discuss current concepts of the pathophysiology of AD, noting how defective skin barrier function, epidermal hyperplasia, and abnormal immune responses favor the spread of poxviral infection, and identify a number of unanswered questions about EV. We conclude by considering how its occurrence might be minimized in the event of a return to universal vaccination.

### Recent insights into atopic dermatitis and implications for management of infectious complications [^3cde5bd0]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2010). Low credibility.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common complex disease that frequently follows a chronic relapsing course and affects the quality of life of patients and families in a significant manner. New insights into the pathophysiology of AD point to an important role of structural abnormalities in the epidermis combined with immune dysregulation. Patients with AD have a unique predisposition to colonization or infection by a number of microbial organisms, most notably Staphylococcus aureus and herpes simplex virus. A multipronged approach directed at healing or protecting the skin barrier and addressing the immune dysregulation is necessary to improve the likelihood of successful outcomes.

### Eczema herpeticum in pregnancy and neonatal herpes infection [^36e78fbb]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Eczema herpeticum is caused by herpes simplex infection of atopic dermatitis. The infection typically causes a vesiculopustular rash, but can disseminate and be life threatening.

Case

A primigravida with a history of eczema and hypogammaglobulinemia presented at 28 weeks of gestation with preterm labor, fever, and extensive rash. After failed tocolysis, she delivered vaginally. Prompt treatment with parenteral acyclovir was initiated for both patients based on a clinical diagnosis of maternal eczema herpeticum. Cultures confirmed the diagnosis of eczema herpeticum and rectal swab of the infant was positive for herpes simplex virus. The mother and infant did well.

Conclusion

Early diagnosis and treatment of eczema herpeticum is necessary to prevent poor outcomes in pregnancy. Prophylactic acyclovir may help prevent eczema herpeticum in pregnancy.

### Increased risk of cutaneous and systemic Infections in atopic dermatitis – A cohort study [^71185b9a]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

In summary, we found increased risks of all infectious outcomes examined, which include both cutaneous and noncutaneous infections caused by bacteria, viruses, and fungi. This observation raises numerous questions about the nature of immunological defects in AD. One study found that subjects with AD in whom eczema herpeticum develops have more severe T helper type 2 cell-polarized disease, more atopic comorbidities, and more cutaneous infections. Our study adds epidemiologic evidence suggesting that AD patients may additionally be at risk of noncutaneous infections. A significant body of functional and genotype/phenotype data has been developed for filaggrin, and there is a need for similar work linking immunological defects to clinical phenotypes.

Determining if individuals with AD are at increased risk of infections is important to guide the development of screening and prevention programs to reduce the morbidity associated with AD. Moreover, a baseline understanding of infectious risk is particularly important in the context of the introduction of the many new biologic therapies now in the pipeline for AD.

### Treatment of mucocutaneous presentations of herpes simplex virus infections [^e20e8550]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

Infections by herpes simplex virus (HSV) types I and II are diverse and quite frequent. After primary infection, the virus establishes a life-long latency in the sensory ganglia and recrudescences may occur at an unpredictable rate. Recurrent labial and genital herpes infections represent the majority of clinical manifestations of HSV infections. Their management is currently well established using evidence-based medicine data. Primary labial herpes is generally not treated with antivirals in otherwise healthy children, although intravenous aciclovir may be offered in severe primary infections, particularly in the immunocompromised patient. The decision whether or not to treat recurrent labial herpes should be evaluated individually and depends on the frequency and severity of relapses, the impairment of the quality of life, and the cost of therapy. Patients with mild disease may benefit from topical therapy, and those with severe and frequent recurrences may be considered for intermittent or long-term oral antiviral therapy. Primary genital herpes is treated with oral or intravenous antivirals, depending on the severity of the infection and associated symptoms. Recurrent genital herpes can be managed with episodic short courses of oral antivirals in patients whose recurrences are moderate to severe and rare, and have a clear prodrome. Patients with > 5 episodes/year, severe recurrences or unrecognisable prodromes may be best managed with long-term suppressive antiviral prophylaxis. HSV is also responsible for a variety of other clinical manifestations, including herpetic whitlow, neonatal infection, disseminated and atypical cutaneous infections, traumatic herpes, eczema herpeticum, and HSV-associated erythema multiforme. HSV infection may also represent a complication following cosmetic procedures of the oro-facial region, surgical and dental interventions, sun exposure and burns. Precise treatment guidelines for these HSV infections are not firmly established.

### Eczema herpeticum: making the diagnosis in the emergency department [^cc4f6c73]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Eczema herpeticum (EH), a form of Kaposi's varicelliform eruption, is the dissemination of herpes simplex virus in the setting of preexisting eczema. We discuss the case of an 18-year-old woman with underlying atopic dermatitis (AD) who presented to an Emergency Department complaining of malaise, fever, and a spreading, burning, vesiculopapular facial rash. She was treated for both presumed impetigo and a flare of her underlying AD with cephalexin, bacitracin ointment, topical steroids, and diphenhydramine. Her condition worsened, and she was seen 3 days later by her primary care physician, who recognized the superimposition of a herpetic infection on her underlying AD and revised the diagnosis to EH. An oral regimen of acyclovir led to prompt resolution of the patient's rash and symptoms. Recognition of EH in the acute care setting is essential for the provision of timely and specific treatment and to avoid the serious sequelae of this condition.

### Delayed acyclovir and outcomes of children hospitalized with eczema herpeticum [^673a1ec0]. Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe the epidemiology and outcomes of children hospitalized with eczema herpeticum and to determine the association with delayed acyclovir on outcomes.

Patients and Methods

This was a multicenter retrospective cohort study conducted between January 1, 2001, and March 31, 2010, of 1331 children aged 2 months to 17 years with eczema herpeticum from 42 tertiary care children's hospitals in the Pediatric Health Information System database. Multivariable linear regression models determined the association between delayed acyclovir therapy and the main outcome measure: hospital length of stay (LOS).

Results

There were no deaths during the study period. Staphylococcus aureus infection was diagnosed in 30.3% of the patients; 3.9% of the patients had a bloodstream infection. Fifty-one patients (3.8%) required ICU admission. There were 893 patients (67.1%) who received acyclovir on the first day of admission. The median LOS increased with each day delay in acyclovir initiation. In multivariable analysis, delay of acyclovir initiation by 1 day was associated with an 11% increased LOS (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3%-20%; P = 0.008), and LOS increased by 41% when acyclovir was started on day 3 (95% CI: 19%-67%; P < .001) and by 98% when started on day 4 to 7 (95% CI: 60%-145%; P < .001). Use of topical corticosteroids on day 1 of hospitalization was not associated with LOS.

Conclusions

Delay of acyclovir initiation is associated with increased LOS in hospitalized children with eczema herpeticum. Use of topical corticosteroids on admission is not associated with increased LOS. The mortality rate of hospitalized children with eczema herpeticum is low.

### Atopic dermatitis: update on skin-directed management: clinical report [^79742f98]. Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Viral infections in pediatric atopic dermatitis (AD) — molluscum contagiosum (MC), eczema herpeticum, and eczema coxsackium — are characterized as follows: MC "is 5 times more prevalent in patients with AD vs those without eczema" and "may persist from weeks to years"; eczema herpeticum "can rarely lead to life-threatening disseminated herpes simplex virus infection", and "In patients who require hospitalization, early recognition and treatment with systemic antivirals shortens hospitalization"; "Treatment of underlying AD with topical corticosteroids does not prolong hospitalization, and therefore, should not be withheld during eczema herpeticum"; and eczema coxsackium "is characterized by polymorphous vesicles and bullae, distributed in areas previously or currently involved with AD, as well as an acral distribution (cheeks, buttocks, hands, and feet)", with "Supportive care and treatment of the underlying AD often leads to resolution in 1 to 2 weeks without sequelae".

### Whole genome sequencing identifies novel genetic mutations in patients with eczema herpeticum [^051029de]. Allergy (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Eczema herpeticum (EH) is a rare complication of atopic dermatitis (AD) caused by disseminated herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection. The role of rare and/or deleterious genetic variants in disease etiology is largely unknown. This study aimed to identify genes that harbor damaging genetic variants associated with HSV infection in AD with a history of recurrent eczema herpeticum (ADEH+).

Methods

Whole genome sequencing (WGS) was performed on 49 recurrent ADEH+ (≥ 3 EH episodes), 491 AD without a history of eczema herpeticum (ADEH-) and 237 non-atopic control (NA) subjects. Variants were annotated, and a gene-based approach (SKAT-O) was used to identify genes harboring damaging genetic variants associated with ADEH+. Genes identified through WGS were studied for effects on HSV responses and keratinocyte differentiation.

Results

Eight genes were identified in the comparison of recurrent ADEH+to ADEH-and NA subjects: SIDT2, CLEC7A, GSTZ1, TPSG1, SP110, RBBP8NL, TRIM15, and FRMD3. Silencing SIDT2 and RBBP8NL in normal human primary keratinocytes (NHPKs) led to significantly increased HSV-1 replication. SIDT2-silenced NHPKs had decreased gene expression of IFNk and IL1b in response to HSV-1 infection. RBBP8NL-silenced NHPKs had decreased gene expression of IFNk, but increased IL1b. Additionally, silencing SIDT2 and RBBP8NL also inhibited gene expression of keratinocyte differentiation markers keratin 10 (KRT10) and loricrin (LOR).

Conclusion

SIDT2 and RBBP8NL participate in keratinocyte's response to HSV-1 infection. SIDT2 and RBBP8NL also regulate expression of keratinocyte differentiation genes of KRT10 and LOR.

### Delgocitinib (Anzupgo) [^273d15f7]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Serious Infections

ANZUPGO may increase the risk of infections. Eczema herpeticum was observed in a subject treated with ANZUPGO [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Serious and sometimes fatal infections due to bacterial, mycobacterial, invasive fungal, viral, or other opportunistic pathogens have been reported in patients receiving oral or topical JAK inhibitors [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Avoid use of ANZUPGO in patients with an active or serious infection.

Consider the risks and benefits of treatment prior to initiating ANZUPGO in patients:

with chronic or recurrent infection
who have been exposed to tuberculosis
with a history of a serious or an opportunistic infection
with underlying conditions that may predispose them to infection.

Closely monitor patients for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with ANZUPGO. A patient who develops a new infection during treatment with ANZUPGO should undergo prompt and complete diagnostic testing; appropriate antimicrobial therapy should be initiated; and the patient should be closely monitored. Interrupt treatment with ANZUPGO if a patient develops a serious infection. Do not resume ANZUPGO until the infection resolves or is adequately treated.

Viral Reactivation

Viral reactivation, including cases of herpes virus reactivation (e.g., herpes zoster), were reported in clinical trials with ANZUPGO. If a patient develops herpes zoster, consider interrupting ANZUPGO treatment until the episode resolves.

The impact of ANZUPGO on chronic viral hepatitis reactivation is unknown. Patients with active hepatitis B or C infection were excluded from clinical trials with ANZUPGO. Consider viral hepatitis screening and monitoring for reactivation in accordance with clinical guidelines before starting therapy and during therapy with ANZUPGO. If signs of reactivation occur, consult a hepatitis specialist. ANZUPGO is not recommended for use in patients with active hepatitis B or hepatitis C.

5.2 Non-melanoma Skin Cancers

Non-melanoma skin cancers including basal cell carcinoma have been reported in subjects treated with ANZUPGO. Periodic skin examinations of the application sites are recommended for all patients, particularly those with risk factors for skin cancer. Advise patients to avoid sunlamps and minimize exposure to sunlight by wearing sun-protective clothing or using broad-spectrum sunscreen.

### A corneal dendritic lesion with a skin eruption: eczema herpeticum, an important differential diagnosis [^e4809208]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Eczema herpeticum is a rare and potentially life-threatening viral infection. We present the case of a 54-year-old man who presented to the emergency eye clinic with a dendritic ulcer and a facial rash. An initial diagnosis of herpes zoster ophthalmicus was suspected. On follow-up, the rash had begun to rapidly disseminate and was no longer respecting dermatome boundaries. A diagnosis of eczema herpeticum was made and appropriate treatment started. This case highlights the importance of a comprehensive history and close inspection of skin lesions in patients with herpetic eye disease.

### Empiric antibiotics and outcomes of children hospitalized with eczema herpeticum [^9b60c2fe]. Pediatric Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Although patients with eczema herpeticum often receive antibiotics for presumed bacterial coinfection, the effect of empiric antibiotic therapy is unknown. Our objective therefore was to determine the association between empiric antibiotics and outcomes in children hospitalized with eczema herpeticum. We conducted a multicenter retrospective cohort study of 1,150 children ages 2months to 17years admitted with eczema herpeticum between January 1, 2001, and March 31, 2010, to 42 tertiary care children's hospitals in the Pediatric Health Information System. All patients received antibiotics during the hospitalization. Multivariable linear regression models determined the association between empiric antibiotic therapy and the main outcome measure: hospital length of stay (LOS). There were no deaths during the study period. Receipt of empiric antibiotics was not associated with a change in the LOS on unadjusted or multivariable analysis. The class of empiric antibiotic was not associated with the LOS except for receipt of vancomycin, which was associated with a longer LOS (21% adjusted longer LOS, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 8–35%; p = 0.001). When restricted to patients with a bloodstream infection, receipt of empiric antibiotics was associated with a 51% adjusted shorter LOS (95% CI = -24 to -68%; p = 0.002). In children hospitalized with eczema herpeticum, empiric antibiotic therapy was not associated with a shorter LOS overall, but was associated with a shorter LOS in patients with a bloodstream infection. These findings highlight the importance of early recognition of systemic bacterial illness in children with eczema herpeticum. Empiric antibiotics did not affect mortality, which is low.

### Eczema herpeticum and clinical criteria for investigating smallpox [^12e7fc8b]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

After the 2001 anthrax bioterrorism incidents, public health officials became concerned about bioterrorist threats of smallpox. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), along with interested partners, developed a clinical algorithm for rapid evaluation of patients with acute generalized vesiculopustular rash illness (AGVPRI). In a surveillance system designed to detect an index case of smallpox, high specificity is critical to minimize false-positive reports of a disease that no longer exists in nature.

CDC's algorithm emphasizes 3 major clinical features of smallpox: febrile prodrome, typical appearance of characteristic lesions, and uniform lesion morphology (Table). The algorithm stratifies AGVPRI cases into high, moderate, and low likelihood of smallpox. Passive and active surveillance has stratified no case to high risk. We describe a patient whose illness fulfilled CDC's high-risk criteria for smallpox, although he actually had eczema herpeticum.

### Predisposing factors and clinical features of eczema herpeticum: a retrospective analysis of 100 cases [^6a5cc8ff]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Eczema herpeticum (EH) is a widespread herpes simplex virus infection of inflamed skin, most often occurring in patients with atopic dermatitis (AD). A monomorphic eruption of dome-shaped blisters and pustules in the eczematous lesions along with severe systemic illness lead to the clinical diagnosis, but atypical variants with disseminated slits may also occur. Topical use of corticosteroids is alleged to be a pathogenetic factor for EH, but predisposing factors for EH are largely unknown. Objective and methods We sought to characterize the clinical features and predisposing factors for EH. A retrospective analysis of 100 patients with EH seen from 1980 through 1996 and of 105 control patients with AD was performed.

Results

Fever and lymphopenia were associated with EH, whereas an increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate was frequently seen in patients with EH and control patients who were impetiginized. In 100 patients with EH, primary herpes simplex virus infection was likely in 20 patients, and a secondary herpes simplex virus infection was suggestive in 26 patients. In all, 13 patients had a second EH, whereas 3 patients had a third EH. Patients with EH had a significantly earlier onset of AD and a significantly higher total serum IgE level than the control patients. More than 75% of the patients with EH had not received corticosteroid treatment in the 4 weeks before onset of EH.

Conclusions

The characteristics of patients with EH are those associated with severe manifestations of AD. The majority of EH occurs in patients with untreated AD, arguing against a role for topical corticosteroids in the development of EH.

### Topical corticosteroids and hospital length of stay in children with eczema herpeticum [^ab7e46c1]. Pediatric Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

There is concern that the use of topical corticosteroids in patients with eczema herpeticum may facilitate dissemination of herpes simplex virus and worsen disease. Our primary aim therefore was to determine whether topical corticosteroid use in children hospitalized with eczema herpeticum is associated with longer hospital length of stay (LOS). We performed a multicenter retrospective cohort study of 1,331 children ages 2months to 17years admitted with a diagnosis of eczema herpeticum between January 1, 2001, and March 31, 2010, to 42 tertiary care children's hospitals in the Pediatric Health Information System database. Multivariable linear regression models determined the association between receipt of topical corticosteroid therapy on the first day of hospitalization and the main outcome measure: LOS. Receipt of topical corticosteroid therapy on day 1 of hospitalization was not associated with a longer LOS on unadjusted or multivariable analysis (p = 0.75). Receipt of topical calcineurin inhibitors during the hospitalization was also not associated with a longer LOS (p = 0.12). Receipt of systemic corticosteroids was associated with an 18% adjusted longer LOS (95% confidence interval 2%-36%; p = 0.03). Further study is needed to identify which children with eczema herpeticum may benefit from topical corticosteroids, but their use during active infection is not associated with poorer outcomes, although the use of systemic corticosteroids was associated with a longer LOS and should be avoided in patients with eczema herpeticum pending future prospective study.

### Filaggrin mutations that confer risk of atopic dermatitis confer greater risk for eczema herpeticum [^6397e49a]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Loss-of-function null mutations R501X and 2282del4 in the skin barrier gene, filaggrin (FLG), represent the most replicated genetic risk factors for atopic dermatitis (AD). Associations have not been reported in African ancestry populations. Atopic dermatitis eczema herpeticum (ADEH) is a rare but serious complication of AD resulting from disseminated cutaneous herpes simplex virus infections.

Objective

We aimed to determine whether FLG polymorphisms contribute to ADEH susceptibility.

Methods

Two common loss-of-function mutations plus 9 FLG single nucleotide polymorphisms were genotyped in 278 European American patients with AD, of whom 112 had ADEH, and 157 nonatopic controls. Replication was performed on 339 African American subjects.

Results

Significant associations were observed for both the R501X and 2282del4 mutations and AD among European American subjects (P = 1.46 x 10(-5), 3.87 x 10(-5), respectively), but the frequency of the R501X mutation was 3 times higher (25% vs 9%) for ADEH than for AD without eczema herpeticum (EH) (odds ratio [OR], 3.4; 1.7–6.8; P = 0.0002). Associations with ADEH were stronger with the combined null mutations (OR, 10.1; 4.7–22.1; P = 1.99 x 10(-11)). Associations with the R501X mutation were replicated in the African American population; the null mutation was absent among healthy African American subjects, but present among patients with AD (3.2%; P = 0.035) and common among patients with ADEH (9.4%; P = 0.0049). However, the 2282del4 mutation was absent among African American patients with ADEH and rare (< 1%) among healthy individuals.

Conclusion

The R501X mutation in the gene encoding filaggrin, one of the strongest genetic predictors of AD, confers an even greater risk for ADEH in both European and African ancestry populations, suggesting a role for defective skin barrier in this devastating condition.

### Eczema herpeticum and clinical criteria for investigating smallpox [^81dbf801]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Eczema herpeticum, described by Kaposi in 1887, is most common in patients with atopic dermatitis but can occur in other conditions that disrupt epidermal integrity. In eczema herpeticum, lesions are typically monomorphic vesicles that evolve into pustules. Fever, malaise, lymphadenopathy, and tender skin may accompany cutaneous eruption. The histopathologic features noted in our biopsy are classic for herpetic skin lesions.

Fever is a well-recognized sign of infection; however, hypothermia can also signal serious disease, including bacterial sepsis or viral encephalitis, and may be more dire than fever in severely ill hospitalized patients. We propose that our patient's hypothermic temperature dysregulation is equivalent to fever, thus serving as a major diagnostic criterion.

This case shows the importance of Tzanck smears to rule out smallpox. When a patient with AGVPRI is evaluated for possible smallpox, rapid laboratory tests are necessary. Viral culture does not yield results quickly enough to avert infection control measures expected with a smallpox case. Indeed, CDC reports 7 incidents when patients with AGVPRI prompted emergency department diversions or hospital closures. Also, rapid confirmation of nonvariola etiology can help avert public panic, a potential problem in a suspected smallpox outbreak and a probable intended consequence of a terrorist attack.

The Tzanck smear must be performed by someone experienced in using the technique and interpreted by someone who can confidently and correctly distinguish herpesvivus nuclear inclusions from poxvirus cytoplasmic inclusions. DFA for HSV and VZV is relatively rapid, but in our case, the DFA result was positive for VZV, although viral culture and immunohistochemical staining later showed that the patient's infection was due to HSV-2. Had we been unable to confirm a nonvariola etiology, we would have proceeded to poxvirus testing. With no commercially available tests for smallpox, the algorithm advises close coordination among local, state, and federal public health authorities. Some state and federal reference laboratories can provide confirmatory tests, including PCR, for orthopoxviruses such as smallpox and monkeypox. Although not performed in this case, we recommend such testing if a simultaneous infection with an orthopoxvirus cannot be ruled out.

There was no increase in overall, serious, or severe infections in dupilumab-treated patients across all age groups in this analysis. Clinically important herpetic infections (eczema herpeticum and herpes zoster) were uncommon in all dupilumab trials. Oral herpes accounted for most of the herpetic infections reported in dupilumab-treated patients, with incidence rates slightly higher versus placebo in 16-week studies but with rates similar to placebo in the 52-week RCT. EAIRs of herpetic infections in the adult OLE and PED-OLE were generally similar to the corresponding RCTs, confirming that the incidence of herpes viral infections does not increase with long-term dupilumab treatment. Opportunistic infections, eczema herpeticum, herpes zoster, hematologic AEs, and cardiovascular AEs were only infrequently reported with dupilumab, both in the clinical studies described here and in real-world studies. Rigorous long-term additional surveillance will be needed to confirm the incidence of SAEs with Janus kinase inhibitors (JAKi) in patients with AD; these studies have been required by health authorities.

### Eczema herpeticum in children: clinical features and factors predictive of hospitalization [^14f02ccf]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe the clinical characteristics of pediatric patients with eczema herpeticum and to determine the predictors of hospitalization, and recurrence and repeat episodes.

Study Design

A retrospective cohort study of patients 0–18 years of age diagnosed with eczema herpeticum between May 2000 and April 2009 was carried out at a tertiary pediatric care center in Canada. Seventy-nine patients were included. The primary outcome was hospitalization; secondary outcomes were recurrent and repeat episodes of eczema herpeticum.

Results

At presentation, 76% of 79 patients with eczema herpeticum had a generalized eruption, 56% had fever, 37% had systemic symptoms, and 10% had eye involvement (keratoconjunctivitis). Forty-five patients (57%) were hospitalized. Predictors for hospitalization included male sex (OR = 3.09; 95% CI, 1.20–7.95, P = 0.017), fever (OR = 5.75; 95% CI, 2.17–15.26, P < .001), systemic symptoms (OR = 2.84; 95% CI, 1.06–7.62, P = 0.035), and age < 1 year (OR = 7.17; 95% CI, 2.17–23.72, P = 0.001). Recurrence rate (< 1 month) was 8.9% and rate of repeat episodes (> 1 month) was 16%. Hospitalized patients were more likely to have a repeat episode (OR = 8.25; 95% CI, 0.99–68.69, P = 0.05). Patients with a previous history of eczema herpeticum had increased likelihood of early recurrence (OR = 6.80; 95% CI, 0.99–46.62, P = 0.05) and repeat episodes (OR = 9.43; 95% CI, 1.52–55.9, P = 0.01).

Conclusions

Predictors of hospitalization in this cohort included male sex, age < 1 year, fever, and systemic symptoms at presentation. Hospitalized patients may be at risk for repeat episodes of eczema herpeticum.

### Exaggerated IDO1 expression and activity in Langerhans cells from patients with atopic dermatitis upon viral stimulation: a potential predictive biomarker for high risk of eczema herpeticum [^fa4dd5e7]. Allergy (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a heterogenous and highly complex disease characterized by an increased microbial colonization. For unknown reasons, a subgroup of patients with AD develops Eczema herpeticum (EH), a severe viral complication due to spreading of herpes simplex virus (HSV). Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO1) is a tryptophan (Trp)-catabolizing enzyme which is assumed to be instrumental in the antibacterial and antiviral defence mechanisms.

Methods

Comparative investigation of the IDO1 expression and activity in freshly isolated monocytes, plasmacytoid DC (pDC) and in vitro-generated Langerhans cells (LC) obtained from AD patients with HSV infections and EH and nonatopic controls.

Results

We demonstrate an increase in Trp degradation in the serum of patients during acute EH episodes. Circulating pDC from patients with history of EH display an increased IDO1 expression. An increased Trp degradation is detected in the supernatants of circulating monocytes from AD patients with acute EH. Mature LC from AD patients with history of EH and with acute EH display an increased IDO1 expression and activity, respectively. In LC from patients with history of EH, viral signals induce an exaggerated IDO1 expression and activity.

Conclusion

IDO1 expression and activity in LC seem to be involved in the pathophysiology of EH in AD and could represent a predictive biomarker for patients with risk to develop EH and other viral complications.

### Algorithms in allergy: diagnosis and treatment of atopic dermatitis complicated by eczema herpeticum [^49892602]. Allergy (2025). Medium credibility.

EH is primarily diagnosed clinically. Confirmatory diagnostics primarily include HSV polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which is the gold standard for HSV detection (Figure 1). Other diagnostic methods, such as histology and antigen detection via immunofluorescence, can be utilized if HSV PCR is unavailable. Clinical differential diagnoses include bacterial superinfection of eczema, impetigo, eczema coxsackium caused by coxsackie virus, and varicella zoster virus infections. While EH typically presents with monomorphic, non‐grouped vesicles on eczematous skin, eczema coxsackium often shows polymorphic vesiculobullous lesions, typically including acrofacial involvement optionally leading to acral desquamation. In unclear cases, PCR testing for both HSV and enteroviruses is recommended to distinguish between the two entities. Although impetigo may occasionally be associated with systemic symptoms, this is uncommon. Moreover, although initial skin lesions may include small superficial blisters, they typically lack the monomorphic vesicular eruption characteristic of EH. Varicella may also cause disseminated vesicular eruptions; however, the lesions are typically polymorphic, resembling Heubner's "celestial chart" and frequently involve the scalp and oral cavity, distinguishing it from the more monomorphic and localized presentation of eczema herpeticum.

### Infections in patients with atopic dermatitis and the influence of treatment [^68d9baee]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Baricitinib In an integrated safety analysis of data from baricitinib RCTs, the adjusted incidence rate of HSV infection with baricitinib 2 mg and 4 mg was 12.4 and 21.3 per 100 PY, respectively, compared with 9.4 per 100 PY with placebo. The incidence of HSV infection was highest in the first 16 weeks of treatment and declined thereafter. In the placebo-controlled dataset, the adjusted incidence rate of herpes zoster infection was 2.8 per 100 PY with baricitinib 2 mg (no herpes zoster events occurred with baricitinib 4 mg) and 1.0 per 100 PY with placebo, compared with 3.8 and 1.8 per 100 PY in the extended dataset with baricitinib 2 mg and 4 mg, respectively, and 2.3 per 100 PY in the dataset containing all baricitinib doses (1 mg, 2 mg and 4 mg). The adjusted incidence rate for eczema herpeticum was 0.2 and 1.4 per 100 PY in the baricitinib 2 mg and 4 mg groups, respectively, compared with 0.4 per 100 PY in the placebo group. An integrated analysis of eight RCTs in adults with AD found that the rate of serious infections with baricitinib 2 and 4 mg was 1.4 and 2.7 per 100 PY, respectively; the rate in the placebo group was 2.1 per 100 PY. The most common serious infections in the overall baricitinib group were eczema herpeticum (0.3 per 100 PY), cellulitis (0.2 per 100 PY), erysipelas, pneumonia and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia (0.1 per 100 PY each). In a baricitinib 2–4 mg-extended data analysis set, among patients reporting skin infections that required antibiotic treatment, the incidence rate was lower in the 4-mg (2.5) versus the 2-mg (4.5) group and the more common PTs included skin infection, folliculitis, cellulitis and impetigo. The available RCT, long-term extension and real-world evidence suggests that no clinically relevant or consistent dose-dependent response is associated with the 4 mg versus the 2 mg dose of baricitinib for AEs of special interest, except for infections, including herpes zoster, nor for the occurrence of venous thromboembolism, for which an imbalance between baricitinib and placebo has been observed during the placebo-controlled study periods in rheumatoid arthritis clinical trials. In a RCT of children with AD, the incidence of infections (most commonly respiratory tract infections) was similar in those receiving baricitinib 2 or 4 mg or placebo for 16 weeks; no serious infections were reported.

### Association between atopic dermatitis and serious cutaneous, multiorgan and systemic infections in US adults [^698e0028]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is associated with barrier disruption, immune dysregulation, and immunosuppressing treatments that can increase the association with an unusual number of infections.

Objective

To determine whether adults with AD have an unusually large number of serious infections and related outcomes.

Methods

Data from the 2002 to 2012 National Inpatient Sample were analyzed, including an approximately 20% sample of all US hospitalizations (n = 72,108,077 adults). Prevalence of serious infections in hospitalized patients with vs without AD, length of stay, cost of care, and inpatient mortality secondary to serious infections were determined.

Results

The prevalence of serious infections expressed as a percentage (95% confidence interval) was higher in adults hospitalized with than in those without AD (42.1% [41.6–42.6] vs 25.4% [25.2–25.6]; P = 0.0002). In logistic regression models with multiple predictors (multivariable logistic regression models), AD was associated with 32 of 38 infections examined. Associated cutaneous infections included eczema herpeticum (odds ratio [95% confidence interval] adjusted for other predictors: 67.93 [47.93–96.28]), erysipelas (11.15 [9.47–13.1]), and cellulitis (4.53 [4.42–4.64]). Associated respiratory infections included aspergillosis (1.51 [1.21–1.88]) and tuberculosis (1.57 [1.41–1.76]). AD was associated with extracutaneous, multiorgan, and systemic infections, including infectious arthropathy (2.01 [1.84–2.20]), endocarditis (1.25 [1.12–1.39]), encephalitis (1.65 [1.40–1.96]), and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections (3.29 [3.17–3.42]). Patients with AD hospitalized with vs without any serious infection had an increased geometric mean cost of inpatient care ($8,273 [8,126–8,423] vs $7,179 [7,052–7,307]) and length of stay (5.3 days [5.2–5.3] vs 3.9 [3.9–4.0]; P = 0.0002), with $11 to $228 million excess annual costs from hospitalization with serious infections in adults with AD.

Conclusion

Adults with AD had increased cutaneous, respiratory, multiorgan, and systemic infections, which were associated with a considerable cost burden.

### Atopic dermatitis and the medications used for its management: impact on ocular health [^a8b891e0]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Atopic Dermatitis (AD) is one of the most common inflammatory skin conditions. AD is generally characterized by eczematous and pruritic skin lesions, although it can present differently between individuals. There are multiple comorbidities for AD, including asthma, food allergies, and ocular disorders such as conjunctivitis. Common treatments for AD include topical corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors, and injectable biologic medications. However, all these medications pose risks that may deter some patients. Ocular risks are associated with use of both topical corticosteroids and biologics, which presents an interesting challenge as ocular risks are also comorbidities for AD itself. We present a case of one patient&rsquo; s history with severe AD and ocular disorders. Since ocular disorders were of great concern to her, she chose to treat her eczema conservatively with non-steroidal topical medications. Her eczema remained poorly controlled, and she subsequently developed eczema herpeticum. Once recovered from eczema herpeticum, she decided to initiate biologic treatment. With dupilumab therapy, her eczema cleared promptly and revealed to her how much her eczema had compromised her quality of life now that she had accepted the treatment that frightened her for many years.

### Ankyrin repeat domain 1 regulates innate immune responses against herpes simplex virus 1: a potential role in eczema herpeticum [^21f1cf8d]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common inflammatory skin disease. A subset of patients with AD are susceptible to disseminated herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection, a complication termed eczema herpeticum (ADEH+). The immune mechanisms causing ADEH+ remain elusive. Using RNA sequencing, we recently found that ankyrin repeat domain 1 (ANKRD1) was significantly induced in human PBMCs upon HSV-1 stimulation, and its induction in patients with ADEH+ was significantly reduced compared with that seen in AD patients without a history of eczema herpeticum (ADEH-).

Objective

We sought to validate ANKRD1 gene expression in nonatopic (NA) subjects, patients with ADEH-, and patients with ADEH+ and to delineate the biological function of ANKRD1 and the signaling pathway or pathways involved.

Methods

Purification of human PBMCs, monocytes, B cells, dendritic cells, T cells, and natural killer cells; RNA extraction and quantitative RT-PCR; small interfering RNA technique; co-immunoprecipitation; and Western blot assays were used.

Results

ANKRD1 expression was significantly reduced in PBMCs from patients with ADEH+ after HSV-1 stimulation compared with PBMCs from patients with ADEH-. We found that the induction of ANKRD1 by HSV-1 and multiple pattern recognition receptor agonists are mediated by inflammatory cytokines. Silencing ANKRD1 gene expression in antigen-presenting cells led to increased viral load and reduced IFNB1 and IL29 production. Using co-immunoprecipitation methods, we demonstrated that ANKRD1 formed protein complexes with interferon regulatory factor (IRF) 3 and IRF7, which are important transcription factors regulating signaling transduction of pattern recognition receptors. Overexpression of ANKRD1 enhanced the IRF3-mediated signaling pathways.

Conclusion

ANKRD1 is involved in IRF3-mediated antiviral innate immune signaling pathways. Its reduced expression in patients with ADEH+ might contribute to the pathogenesis of ADEH+.

### Bacterial infections are common among eczema herpeticum inpatients in a cross-sectional analysis of the 2016 kids' inpatient database [^c8529311]. Pediatric Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Eczema herpeticum (EH) is a cutaneous infection with herpes simplex virus, typically in the context of atopic dermatitis. Pediatric hospitalizations for EH have increased over the past several decades, yet few studies have investigated comorbidities or epidemiology of pediatric EH inpatients. We searched the 2016 Kids' Inpatient Database and recorded demographics, comorbidities, and associated costs for patients with EH. We found bacterial infections were a common comorbidity which affected nearly half (47.4%) of hospitalized patients, suggesting the importance of regular monitoring of pediatric EH inpatients for bacterial coinfection.

### Filaggrin deficiency promotes the dissemination of cutaneously inoculated vaccinia virus [^ab7d744e]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Eczema vaccinatum is a life-threatening complication of smallpox vaccination in patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) characterized by dissemination of vaccinia virus (VV) in the skin and internal organs. Mutations in the filaggrin (FLG) gene, the most common genetic risk factor for AD, confer a greater risk for eczema herpeticum in patients with AD, suggesting that it impairs the response to cutaneous viral infections.

Objective

We sought to determine the effects of FLG deficiency on the response of mice to cutaneous VV inoculation.

Methods

VV was inoculated by means of scarification of unsensitized skin or skin topically sensitized with ovalbumin in FLG-deficient flaky tail (ft/ft) mice or wild-type (WT) control mice. The sizes of primary and satellite skin lesions were measured, and hematoxylin and eosin staining was performed. VV genome copy numbers and cytokine mRNA levels were measured by using quantitative PCR.

Results

VV inoculation in unsensitized skin of ft/ft mice, independent of the matted hair mutation, resulted in larger primary lesions, more abundant satellite lesions, heavier viral loads in internal organs, greater epidermal thickness, dermal cellular infiltration, and higher local Il17a, Il4, Il13, and Ifng mRNA levels than in WT control mice. VV inoculation at sites of topical ovalbumin application amplified all of these features in ft/ft mice but had no detectable effect in WT control mice. The number of satellite lesions and the viral loads in internal organs after cutaneous VV inoculation were significantly reduced in both unsensitized and topically sensitized ft/ftxIl17a(-/-) mice.

Conclusion

FLG deficiency predisposes to eczema vaccinatum. This is mediated primarily through production of IL-17A.

### Tacrolimus (Protopic) [^2792cfec]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

While patients with atopic dermatitis are predisposed to superficial skin
infections including eczema herpeticum (Kaposi's varicelliform eruption),
treatment with PROTOPIC Ointment may be independently associated with an
increased risk of varicella zoster virus infection (chicken pox or shingles),
herpes simplex virus infection, or eczema herpeticum.

Patients with Lymphadenopathy

In clinical studies, 112/13494 (0.8%) cases of lymphadenopathy
were reported and were usually related to infections (particularly of the skin)
and noted to resolve upon appropriate antibiotic therapy. Of these 112 cases,
the majority had either a clear etiology or were known to resolve. Transplant
patients receiving immunosuppressive regimens (e.g., systemic tacrolimus) are at
increased risk for developing lymphoma; therefore, patients who receive PROTOPIC
Ointment and who develop lymphadenopathy should have the etiology of their
lymphadenopathy investigated. In the absence of a clear etiology for the
lymphadenopathy, or in the presence of acute infectious mononucleosis, PROTOPIC
Ointment should be discontinued. Patients who develop lymphadenopathy should be
monitored to ensure that the lymphadenopathy resolves.

Sun Exposure

During the course of treatment, patients should minimize or avoid
natural or artificial sunlight exposure, even while PROTOPIC is not on the skin.
It is not known whether PROTOPIC Ointment interferes with skin response to
ultraviolet damage.

### Tacrolimus ointment 0.1% (tacrolimus) [^ee0b0e12]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

While patients with atopic dermatitis are predisposed to superficial skin infections including eczema herpeticum (Kaposi's varicelliform eruption), treatment with tacrolimus ointment may be independently associated with an increased risk of varicella zoster virus infection (chicken pox or shingles), herpes simplex virus infection, or eczema herpeticum.

Patients with Lymphadenopathy

In clinical studies, 112/13,494 (0.8%) cases of lymphadenopathy were reported and were usually related to infections (particularly of the skin) and noted to resolve upon appropriate antibiotic therapy. Of these 112 cases, the majority had either a clear etiology or were known to resolve. Transplant patients receiving immunosuppressive regimens (e.g., systemic tacrolimus) are at increased risk for developing lymphoma; therefore, patients who receive tacrolimus ointment and who develop lymphadenopathy should have the etiology of their lymphadenopathy investigated. In the absence of a clear etiology for the lymphadenopathy, or in the presence of acute infectious mononucleosis, tacrolimus ointment should be discontinued. Patients who develop lymphadenopathy should be monitored to ensure that the lymphadenopathy resolves.

Sun Exposure

During the course of treatment, patients should minimize or avoid natural or artificial sunlight exposure, even while tacrolimus ointment is not on the skin. It is not known whether tacrolimus ointment interferes with skin response to ultraviolet damage.

Immunocompromised Patients

The safety and efficacy of tacrolimus ointment in immunocompromised patients have not been studied.

Renal Insufficiency

Rare post-marketing cases of acute renal failure have been reported in patients treated with tacrolimus ointment. Systemic absorption is more likely to occur in patients with epidermal barrier defects especially when tacrolimus ointment is applied to large body surface areas. Caution should also be exercised in patients predisposed to renal impairment.

### Bacterial and viral infections in atopic dermatitis: a comprehensive review [^476d28c1]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2016). Low credibility.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is the most common allergic skin disease in the general population. It is a chronic inflammatory skin disease complicated by recurrent bacterial and viral infections that, when left untreated, can lead to significant complications. The current article will review immunologic and molecular mechanisms underlying the propensity of AD patients to microbial infections. These infections include Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) skin infections, eczema herpeticum, eczema vaccinatum, and eczema coxsackium. Previous studies have shown that skin barrier defects, a decrease in antimicrobial peptides, increased skin pH, or Th2 cytokines such as IL-4 and IL-13 are potential contributing factors for the increased risk of skin infections in AD. In addition, bacterial virulence such as methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) produces significantly higher number of superantigens that increase their potential in causing infection and more severe cutaneous inflammation in AD patients. More recent studies suggest that skin microbiome including Staphylococcus epidermidis or other coagulase-negative staphylococci may play an important role in controlling S. aureus skin infections in AD. Other studies also suggest that genetic variants in the innate immune response may predispose AD patients to increased risk of viral skin infections. These genetic variants include thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), type I interferon (α, ß, ω), type II interferon (γ), and molecular pathways that lead to the production of interferons (interferon regulatory factor 2). A common staphylococcal toxin, α-toxin, may also play a role in enhancing herpes simplex virus skin infections in AD. Further understanding of these disease processes may have important clinical implications for the prevention and treatment of skin infections in this common skin disease.

### Infectious complications in atopic dermatitis [^2a047409]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Atopic dermatitis is characterized by the interplay of skin barrier defects with the immune system and skin microbiome that causes patients to be at risk for infectious complications. This article reviews the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis and the mechanisms through which patients are at risk for infection from bacterial, viral, and fungal pathogens. Although these complications may be managed acutely, prevention of secondary infections depends on a multipronged approach in the maintenance of skin integrity, control of flares, and microbial pathogens.

Varicella vaccine — expected rashes, timing, and atopic dermatitis: varicella vaccine can cause vaccine-induced illness with varicella lesions; reactions occur at the injection site in approximately 3% of recipients and are more generalized in another 3%, and the rash typically appears within 3 weeks of vaccination. A zoster-type rash can rarely appear, and the vaccine can be safely administered to children with atopic dermatitis without an increased risk of complications.

### Atypical mucocutaneous manifestations of MPOX: a systematic review [^dfd81a0f]. The Journal of Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

6.4 Eczema monkeypoxicum

Eczema monkeypoxicum was first described during the recent outbreak in 2022. It is a rare complication that mainly affects patients with atopic dermatitis caused by disruption of the skin barrier, with similar pathogenesis to eczema herpeticum or coxsackium, in which the virus invades the eczema lesions. Clusters of lesions are present, and perilesional edema may be a key sign to identify them. This rash may be accompanied by locoregional lymphadenopathy and systemic symptoms, in addition to the characteristic skin lesions in eczema‐affected areas. Generalized papules following viremia may be the diagnostic clue. Unlike the typical presentation of MPOX, sexual contact does not seem to be involved in these cases, which usually occur after occupational exposure or without a clear history of exposure.

6.5 Vaccinated patients and reinfection

The presence of MPOX has been detected by serological evidence and PCR‐positive samples in asymptomatic patients. This is much more frequent among patients vaccinated with the modified vaccinia Ankara vaccine. In addition, the possibility of reinfection with the virus has been increasingly reported, with similar severity but a shorter duration. Screening and vaccination strategies play a vital role in shortening the chain of transmission and mitigating the severity of infection.

6.6 Scars

Information on scarring is scarce in the current literature. Recent studies indicate an elevated risk of 40% to 50% for scarring in patients with MPOX. The risk has been related to clinical onset with skin manifestations as well as the presence of superinfection and abscesses. Depressed and atrophic scars are frequently seen, but hypertrophic scars and areas of scarring alopecia in the perioral area have been identified. A case of a patient with generalized anetoderma after infection has also been documented.

### Integrated safety analysis of abrocitinib for the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis from the phase II and phase III clinical trial program [^d87ac90c]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

These pooled data allowed for an assessment of the potential impact of JAK1 selectivity on infections and hematologic changes. Serious and opportunistic infections and viral reactivation are associated with JAK inhibition. This analysis of abrocitinib in patients with AD found no dose-response relationship for serious infections or an excess of events compared with placebo. The most frequent serious infections were herpetic in nature, and a dose-related increase in herpes zoster infections was observed, which is consistent with the viral reactivation seen with other JAK inhibitors. This was anticipated, as JAK1 inhibitors block signaling of type 1 and type 2 interferons and cytokines via the gamma chain of the IL-2 receptor and are important in lymphocyte development. Unlike with tofacitinib and baricitinib, an increased rate of herpes zoster in Asian patients was not observed. There were no opportunistic events of tuberculosis, fungal infections (including invasive fungal infections), mycobacterial infections, or infections with other intracellular bacteria. Differing results may be due to age of enrolled patients, as older patients are more at risk for infections. Additionally, JAK inhibitor selectivities are different. JAK1-selective inhibitors are expected to preserve signaling of IL-12 and IL-23, cytokines thought to be important in protecting against opportunistic infections. Although this suggests preserved protection with JAK1 inhibition, monitoring for tuberculosis prior to the initiation of abrocitinib will be important.

One aspect that may be unique to the AD population is the relationship between herpes simplex and eczema herpeticum. Patients with AD have a propensity to develop herpes simplex, and in a minority of patients, these events may develop into eczema herpeticum. In this analysis, there was a dose-related increase in herpes simplex events; however, eczema herpeticum events were more frequent in the placebo and abrocitinib 100-mg groups. This suggests that, although herpes simplex is more frequent with abrocitinib 200 mg, these herpes simplex infections do not tend to become disseminated eczema herpeticum. Patients who develop eczema herpeticum have more severe AD, as defined by the Eczema Area and Severity Index, and a more T helper 2-polarized disease, with higher concentrations of immunoglobulin E and eosinophils. Effects of JAK inhibition on eczema herpeticum may be related to improvement in skin barrier function and immunologic abnormalities.

### Safety of tralokinumab in adult patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis: pooled analysis of five randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase II and phase III trials [^d3149fba]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Safety areas of interest

Skin infections requiring systemic treatment and eczema herpeticum occurred less frequently with tralokinumab vs. placebo, in 2.6% vs. 5.5% (9.7 vs. 22.8 events per 100 PYE; RR 0.4, 95% CI 0.3–0.7) and 0.3% vs. 1.5% (1.2 vs. 5.2 events per 100 PYE; RR 0.2, 95% CI 0.1–0.7), respectively (Figure 2; and Tables S11 and S12; see Supporting Information).

Figure 2
Initial treatment period, event rates for safety areas of interest in the atopic dermatitis pool, safety analysis set. Adverse events collected during the exposure time in the initial treatment period are shown. The rate is calculated as the number of events divided by the patient‐years of exposure (PYE) multiplied by 100. Adjusted rates were calculated using Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel weights. AESI, adverse event of special interest; HLT, high‐level term; q2w, every 2 weeks; SMQ, standardized MedDRA query.

Severe infection; serious infection; any infection requiring parenteral antibiotics; any infection requiring oral antibiotics, antivirals or antifungals > 2 weeks; and any opportunistic infection occurred at lower rates with tralokinumab vs. placebo (Table S13; see Supporting Information). Most opportunistic infections in both treatment groups were herpes virus infections, which occurred in fewer patients in the tralokinumab vs. placebo groups (Table S14; see Supporting Information).

Eye disorder AESIs classified by the investigator as conjunctivitis, keratoconjunctivitis or keratitis occurred in more patients receiving tralokinumab than placebo, in 7.9 and 3.4%, respectively (31.1 and 12.9 events per 100 PYE; RR 2.6, 95% CI 1.7–4.1) (Tables S11 and S15; see Supporting Information). The most frequent eye disorder AESI overall was conjunctivitis. Most eye disorder AESIs (98%) were mild or moderate (Figure 2), none were serious and the majority resolved during the study; however, two eye disorder events led to permanent discontinuation of tralokinumab (Table S11). Previous literature presents a detailed analysis of conjunctivitis events.

### Baricitinib: a review in moderate to severe atopic dermatitis [^d7452f98]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Adverse Events of Special Interest

In general, the pattern of AEs of special interest (AESIs) with baricitinib therapy was similar between the AD and RA populations.

Owing to a defective skin barrier, and immunological dysregulation (Sect. 1), patients with AD have an increased risk of bacterial and viral infections (both cutaneous and non-cutaneous). Moreover, via its inhibitory effect on the JAK–STAT pathway (Sect. 2), baricitinib is surmised to increase the risk of infection. In the placebo-controlled dataset, treatment-emergent infections (most were mild or moderate in severity) occurred in 31.5% of baricitinib 4 mg recipients, 29.8% of baricitinib 2 mg recipients and 24.2% of placebo recipients. Baricitinib 4 mg and 2 mg were both associated with a low incidence of serious infections (0.6% and 0.4% vs 0.6% with placebo) and opportunistic infections (excluding tuberculosis) [0% and 0.1% vs 0.1%]. There was also a low incidence of eczema herpeticum (based on a cluster containing the preferred terms eczema herpeticum and Kaposi's varicelliform eruption) [0.2–1.4% across baricitinib 4 mg or 2 mg and placebo recipients] and herpes zoster (0–0.8%). Herpes simplex (based on a cluster of preferred terms) was reported in 6.1% of baricitinib 4 mg recipients, 3.6% of baricitinib 2 mg recipients and 2.7% of placebo recipients and skin infections requiring antibacterial therapy in 3.4%, 4.8% and 4.4% of patients, respectively. There were no cases of tuberculosis reported.

Concomitant viral infection

Several nonbacterial infections can occur concomitantly with bacterial skin infection and can resemble bacterial infections, requiring consideration in the differential diagnosis. For instance, eczema herpeticum (EH) is caused by the local spread of herpes simplex virus, which favours AD lesional skin and is commonly observed in the context of an AD flare. 27 Early in the course of EH the characteristic skin lesions are superficial clusters of dome‐shaped vesicles and/or small, round, punched‐out erosions (Fig. 2 a, b). 27 As the disease progresses, lesions may become superficially infected with S. aureus and may develop an impetiginized scale (Fig. 2 c, d). 12 EH typically arises in involved AD skin, most frequently on the face, neck, upper trunk and antecubital/popliteal areas with AD, and is often accompanied by fever, malaise and lymphadenopathy. 28, 29 Moderate‐to‐severe AD, filaggrin loss‐of‐function mutation, a history of S. aureus skin infection, greater allergen sensitization and type 2 immunity are important risk factors for EH. 30, 31, 32 Staphylococcal α‐toxin and reductions in the tight junction protein claudin‐1 result in greater epidermal spread of herpes simplex virus in vitro. 33, 34 This infection can spread rapidly and, in severe cases, may lead to keratoconjunctivitis and encephalitis.

Herpes Simplex and Eczema Herpeticum

Events of herpes simplex were dose-related, with higher incidence with abrocitinib than placebo; however, no dose–response relationship was observed for eczema herpeticum events (there were none in the abrocitinib 200-mg group; Table 4). When eczema herpeticum and herpes simplex events were considered together, there was no dose response in the abrocitinib 200-mg and 100-mg groups (16.21 and 16.05/100 PY, respectively), but these IRs were higher than in the placebo group (9.88/100 PY). Similar dose–response relationships were observed in the all-abrocitinib cohort.

There were 23 total cases of eczema herpeticum observed in abrocitinib-treated patients. Four events were serious (all in the 100-mg group); 91.7% resolved and five led to study discontinuation (in one patient [0.1%] in the 200-mg group and four [0.5%] in the 100-mg group). Using multivariate analysis, the most significant risk factors for herpes simplex or eczema herpeticum included having medical history of herpes simplex or eczema herpeticum and region other than the United States, Canada, or Australia (Table S6, see ESM). Events of eczema herpeticum in the all-abrocitinib cohort were less frequent in patients with IGA of 0 or 1 (Table S7, see ESM) when events were stratified by IGA score before or immediately after the event start day. Among the 23 events of eczema herpeticum, 21 (91.2%) occurred in patients with uncontrolled AD (IGA > 1).

Eczema herpeticum in atopic dermatitis (AD) — clinical and genetic associations indicate high IgE, Staphylococcus aureus colonization, and specific variants linked to risk. These patients frequently have serum IgE levels of greater than 100 IU/mL and are colonized with S aureus, while less than 5% of patients with AD have EH. A dramatic 10-fold odds ratio for EH has been conferred by filaggrin-null mutations, targeted deep sequencing has identified rare loss-of-function variants in IFNGR1 for AD complicated by EH, and S aureus has been shown to enhance viral replication in keratinocytes.

### Umbilicated papules in an immunocompetent patient [^450c5304]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 39-year-old man presented with a pruritic eruption characterized by diffuse fissured lichenified patches, erythematous and edematous eyelids, conjunctival erythema, and fevers (Fig 1, A). The patient received prednisone in the emergency department and started receiving empiric intravenous vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. On hospital day 5, the patient developed an acute eruption of umbilicated papules with crust involving the face, chest, and extremities (Fig 1, B), and a punch biopsy was performed (Fig 2).

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Contact dermatitis
B. Staphylococcus aureus cutaneous infection
C. Chronic actinic dermatitis (CAD)
D. Eczema herpeticum (EH)
E. Eczema molluscatum

Answers:
A. Contact dermatitis – Incorrect. Although it is possible for the patient to have an underlying contact allergy, contact dermatitis is not usually associated with fever and should improve temporarily with prednisone.
B. Staphylococcus aureus cutaneous infection – Incorrect. Although patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) have a predisposition for secondary Staphylococcus aureus infections and could have fever as a result of a disseminated infection, the unsuccessful treatment with empiric antibiotics makes this choice unlikely. The primary morphology of the lesions present is also more strongly suggestive of a herpesvirus infection.
C. CAD – Incorrect. Pruritic eczematous lesions and lichenified plaques on sun-exposed areas such as the face and hands are concerning for CAD; however, CAD classically spares the eyelids, occurs in men over the age of 50 years, does not present with fever, and would improve with steroid use.
D. EH – Correct. EH, a disseminated cutaneous infection of herpes simplex virus (HSV), presents as clusters of dome-shaped vesicular lesions that rupture to form tiny punched-out ulcers overlying an erythematous base. Systemic symptoms of fever, malaise, and lymphadenopathy may also be present. Because EH occurs as a result of a disrupted epidermis allowing viral entry, preexisting skin conditions such as AD are critical to the pathogenesis.
E. Eczema molluscatum – Incorrect. Although molluscum superinfection can also present with umbilicated papules on a background of AD, pathologic analysis would show more characteristic intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies (Henderson-Patterson bodies). Patients with this condition are also less systemically ill.

### Psoriasis coxsackium [^a6ee5e33]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In 1887, Moritz Kaposi coined the phrase "Kaposi's varicelliform eruption" defining a viral-induced rash in patients with an underlying dermatosis. The most classic presentation is when patients with atopic dermatitis develop eczema herpeticum secondary to herpes simplex virus; however, other viruses have also been implicated, including coxsackievirus A16. There are sparse reports of Kaposi varicelliform eruption in patients with psoriasis, and none in association with coxsackievirus. Herein, we report what is possibly the first known case of psoriasis complicated by coxsackievirus, which we termed "psoriasis coxsackium".

### Antibiotic choice and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus rate in children hospitalized for atopic dermatitis [^2298330f]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Systemic antibiotics are commonly used in hospitalized patients with severe atopic dermatitis (AD) exacerbation. However, the antibiotic prescribing patterns are unclear.

Objective

To compare the prescribing patterns of antibiotics for children who were hospitalized for AD exacerbation and infectious complications.

Methods

Electronic medical records were reviewed for patients younger than 18 years who were hospitalized for AD exacerbation or infectious complications based on International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification and International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification codes from 2003 to 2018. The following information was obtained: history, physical examination findings, physician discharge summary, antibiotic treatments, serum tests, and wound cultures. The t test was used to compare clinical and laboratory features.

Results

A total of 174 patients with AD were included. Seventy patients had AD exacerbation and 104 had infectious complications, including cellulitis, abscesses, invasive infections, and eczema herpeticum. The differences between these 2 groups of patients were further verified by length of stay, serum total IgE level, and inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate). A total of 56 of 70 patients (80%) with AD exacerbation were treated with a systemic antibiotic. Clindamycin and vancomycin together accounted for 88% of antibiotics on admission for both groups, whereas clindamycin and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim were prescribed at similar rates for both groups at discharge. Wound culture results showed that the methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) rate was significantly lower in children with AD exacerbation (22%) vs infectious complications (39%).

Conclusion

Children were treated with a high frequency of anti-MRSA antibiotics for inpatient AD exacerbation and infectious complications. However, the rate of MRSA was significantly lower in children with AD exacerbation. Thus, empiric antibiotic choice for infectious complications may not be appropriate for AD exacerbation.

### Atopic dermatitis complicated by eczema herpeticum is associated with HLA B7 and reduced interferon-γ-producing CD8 + T cells [^1ea69b28]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The increased susceptibility of patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) to disseminated viral skin infections such as eczema herpeticum (ADEH+) is poorly understood.

Objectives

The primary goal of the current study was to determine whether ADEH+ subjects have identifiable defects in cell-mediated immunity that reduce their ability to control viral infections.

Materials and Methods

In this study, we evaluated cytokine expression by various subsets of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from ADEH+ (n = 24) compared with AD without a history of viral infections (ADEH-) (n = 20) before and after treatment with herpes simplex virus (HSV).

Results

We found that interferon (IFN)-γ expression after HSV treatment was lower in the CD8+ T cells and monocytes from patients with ADEH+ compared with patients who are ADEH- or nonatopic. Given the induction of CD8+ T cells as the result of antigen presentation by human leucocyte antigen (HLA) class I, consistent with the findings described above we also found that the HLA B7 allele was significantly associated with risk of the ADEH+ phenotype (odds ratio = 1.91, P = 0.02, 125 ADEH+ and 161 ADEH- subjects).

Conclusions

These data suggest that defects in viral-induced IFN-γ from CD8+ T cells contribute to the ADEH+ phenotype.

### Infections in dupilumab clinical trials in atopic dermatitis: a comprehensive pooled analysis [^2ffdaae9]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Immunomodulatory agents, such as anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) agents, anti-IL-23, anti-IL-17, and Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, increase the risk of infections. However, in clinical trials with dupilumab, there was no evidence of an increase in overall infection rates, nor was there evidence of increased risk of serious or opportunistic infections in dupilumab-treated patients. Moreover, in clinical trials of dupilumab in patients with moderate-to-severe AD, dupilumab-treated patients have shown trends toward lower rates of bacterial and other non-herpetic skin infections and lower rates of the clinically important herpesviral infections eczema herpeticum and herpes zoster, but slightly higher rates of herpes simplex viral infections (i.e. non-eczema herpeticum or herpes zoster) compared with placebo.

Because pooling data from multiple clinical trials increases the likelihood of identifying and confirming signals from individual studies, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of pooled data from randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, phase II and phase III clinical trials with treatment periods of 12–52 weeks to further evaluate the incidence of infections in studies of dupilumab in patients with AD. The objective of this pooled analysis was to assess infection rates for two regimens of dupilumab (SC 300 mg weekly [qw] or 300 mg q2w), compared with placebo, in adult patients with moderate-to-severe AD.

### Infections in dupilumab clinical trials in atopic dermatitis: a comprehensive pooled analysis [^db5753da]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Systemic or invasive infections were uncommon; of note, one patient in the dupilumab q2w group had, by MedDRA PT, bacterial sepsis, two patients in the placebo group had sepsis (including one who also had bacterial endocarditis and septic embolus, which led to treatment discontinuation, as noted above), and one patient in the placebo group had a moderate cytomegalovirus infection that led to treatment discontinuation, as noted above. There were no cases of endoparasitic (e.g. helminthic) infections.

Overall rates of herpesviral infections did not differ significantly between placebo and dupilumab groups when assessed as the number of patients with at least one event per 100 PY, but when assessed as the number of events per 100 PY, they were slightly more common in the dupilumab q2w group and the dupilumab groups combined than in the placebo group (Table 1; and Table E3 in the ESM). The clinically important herpesviral infections eczema herpeticum and herpes zoster were both uncommon; eczema herpeticum was significantly more common in the placebo group than in the dupilumab qw or dupilumab combined groups, whether assessed as patients per 100 PY or events per 100 PY (Table 1; and Table E3 in the ESM). The incidence of herpes zoster infection was numerically higher in the placebo group compared with the dupilumab groups (Table 1; and Table E3 in the ESM). However, the combined rate of the clinically important herpesviral infections eczema herpeticum and herpes zoster was significantly higher in the placebo group than in the dupilumab qw group (RR 0.16, p = 0.003) or the dupilumab groups combined (RR 0.31, p = 0.004; Table 1; and Table E3 in the ESM).

### Frequency and clinical features associated with eczema herpeticum in hospitalized children with presumed atopic dermatitis skin infection [^7f86e081]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Atopic dermatitis (AD) predisposes to viral skin infections, such as eczema herpeticum (EH), and to bacterial skin infections, such as those caused by Staphylococcus aureus (SA) and group A streptococcus (GAS). This study evaluated clinical features of EH and its frequency of codetection with SA or GAS in children hospitalized for presumed AD skin infection.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed clinical data for children ≤ 18 years of age admitted to a large hospital system for AD with presumed skin infection from January 2004 to December 2018. Those with an alternate primary diagnosis or missing microbiologic data were excluded. Encounters with herpes simplex virus testing were identified as AD with EH (ADEH+) or without (ADEH-). Encounters with bacterial skin culture growth were identified as SA or GAS.

Results

Among 180 AD encounters with suspected skin infection, 133 (74%) were tested for herpes simplex virus. Clinical findings associated with ADEH+ status (n = 61) included fever on admission (59% vs. 32% in ADEH-; P = 0.002), rash on the neck (30% vs. 13%; P = 0.015) and vesicular rash (70% vs. 49%; P = 0.011). Encounters in the ADEH+ group had a longer hospital length of stay compared with encounters in the ADEH- group [median 4 days (interquartile range 3–5 days) vs. 3 days (interquartile range 2–3 days); P < 0.001]. GAS was identified in only 1 ADEH+ encounter (2%) versus 15 ADEH- encounters (26%), P < 0.001.

Conclusions

Providers should maintain a high index of suspicion for EH in children admitted for presumed AD skin infection. GAS was more commonly associated with ADEH- encounters.

### The role of bacterial skin infections in atopic dermatitis: expert statement and review from the international eczema council skin infection group [^12a6a80a]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Untreated bacterial skin infection in AD may become systemic and lead to life‐threatening complications including sepsis, endocarditis and bone and joint infections. 20, 21, 22 Despite the significant morbidity caused by bacterial skin infection in AD, there is a lack of consensus on how to define and treat associated bacterial colonization and infection. Although there are many diagnostic criteria for AD itself, there are no validated diagnostic criteria for infected AD. 23

The International Eczema Council, a group of approximately 100 experts in AD worldwide, has recently initiated a taskforce to define the role of bacterial skin infections and their management in AD through consensus statements in an effort to provide level D evidence. It is hoped that input from clinical experts will contribute to better defining the wide‐ranging clinical presentations of S. aureus infection in AD and, more importantly, to identify better those who may benefit from existing or novel antimicrobial treatments. Based on a systematic search of the literature, including terms for AD and 'infection', 'bacteria', 'staphylococcus aureus' and 'microbiome' (detailed search strategy available on request), this narrative review defines the clinical features of bacterial infection in AD and our current understanding of the host and bacterial factors that influence microbial colonization and virulence.

Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2024). High credibility.

Comorbidities and complications of atopic dermatitis (AD) include both atopic and nonatopic conditions, infections, ocular disease, skeletal risk, and cardiometabolic associations. The guideline states that "Several comorbid atopic (food allergy, asthma, allergic rhinitis) and nonatopic (depression, anxiety, neurocognitive impairment, skin infections, and adverse effects of treatment) health problems occur in patients with AD", and that "AD severity is associated with developing such comorbidities and may be due to uncontrolled disease, systemic inflammation, and disturbed sleep". It notes "Complications of skin traumatization in AD include bacterial, viral, and fungal infection, lichen simplex chronicus, and prurigo nodularis. Severe exacerbations can present as erythroderma". Ophthalmic issues are highlighted: "Ophthalmic and ocular diseases, some potentially sight-threatening, occur as comorbidities and complications of AD, such as recurrent keratoconjunctivitis, keratoconus, and anterior subcapsular cataracts", and "Conjunctivitis, for example, can occur after treatment with dupilumab, tralokinumab, or lebrikizumab". Additional risks include bone and systemic disease: "AD is associated with increased fracture incidence… which may be due to decreased physical activity, increased systemic inflammation, and excessive use of certain treatments such as potent topical and systemic corticosteroids", and "Shared mechanisms may also promote AD's possible association with cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, including obesity, hypertension, myocardial infarction, stroke, and heart failure".

### Dupilumab (Dupixent) [^50b37ee6]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Eczema Herpeticum and Herpes Zoster

The rate of eczema herpeticum was similar in the placebo and DUPIXENT groups in the AD trials. The rates remained stable through 260 weeks in the long-term OLE trial (AD-1225).

Herpes zoster was reported in < 1% of the DUPIXENT groups (1 per 100 patient-years) and in < 1% of the placebo group (1 per 100 patient-years) in the 16-week AD monotherapy trials. In the 52-week DUPIXENT + TCS AD trial, herpes zoster was reported in 1% of the DUPIXENT + TCS group (1 per 100 patient-years) and 2% of the placebo + TCS group (2 per 100 patient-years). During the long-term OLE trial with data through 260 weeks (AD-1225), 2.0% of DUPIXENT-treated subjects reported herpes zoster (0.94 per 100 patient-years of follow up). Among asthma subjects the frequency of herpes zoster was similar between DUPIXENT and placebo. Among subjects with CRSwNP or EoE there were no reported cases of herpes zoster or eczema herpeticum.

Among subjects with PN, herpes zoster and ophthalmic herpes zoster were each reported in < 1% of the DUPIXENT group (1 per 100 patient-years) and 0% of the placebo group.

Among subjects with COPD, herpes zoster was reported in 0.9% of the DUPIXENT group and 0.2% of the placebo group. Ophthalmic herpes zoster was reported in 0.1% of the DUPIXENT group and 0.2% of the placebo group.

Among subjects with CSU in the pooled safety population, herpes zoster was reported in < 1% of the DUPIXENT and placebo groups (1 per 100 patient-years). There were no cases of eczema herpeticum reported in the CSU development program.

Among subjects with BP, herpes zoster was reported in 4% of the DUPIXENT group and 0% of the placebo group.

Hypersensitivity Reactions

Hypersensitivity reactions were reported in < 1% of DUPIXENT-treated subjects. These included anaphylaxis, AGEP, serum sickness or serum sickness-like reactions, generalized urticaria, rash, erythema nodosum, and erythema multiforme [see Contraindications (4), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.6)].

### Infections in dupilumab clinical trials in atopic dermatitis: a comprehensive pooled analysis [^99d217e9]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

In contrast to other biologics, dupilumab targets the activity of IL-4 and IL-13, cytokines important in type 2 immune pathways, which are not crucial to host defense mechanisms against most infectious agents, except endoparasites, specifically intestinal helminths. This analysis of pooled data from dupilumab studies revealed no parasitic infections other than one case each of ectoparasitic infection (acarodermatitis) in the placebo group and the dupilumab qw group; none of the studies included in this analysis reported tuberculosis infections or reactivations. Of note, dupilumab did not have an impact on T-cell- and B-cell-mediated (or non-T-cell-mediated) antibody response in a clinical trial using two non-live vaccines (tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis vaccine; and quadrivalent meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine). Direct evidence supporting the safety of administering live vaccines in patients treated with dupilumab is not yet available.

The overall incidence of total herpesviral infections was low in all groups. Herpesviral infection incidence rates overall were slightly higher in the dupilumab groups than in the placebo group, but the difference was small (< 1%). Oral herpes (herpes labialis) accounted for most of the herpesviral infections. The molecular basis of herpes simplex viral reactivation is poorly understood, but the external triggers are fairly well characterized (e.g. sun exposure, stress). Notably, the incidences of eczema herpeticum and herpes zoster were higher in the placebo group than in the dupilumab groups. The higher rate of eczema herpeticum in the placebo group reflects the increased risk of this clinically important and dangerous herpesviral infection in patients with AD, an infection reported to occur in approximately 3% of patients with AD. Patients affected by eczema herpeticum tend to have type 2-dominant disease, and the smaller number of events of this infection in the dupilumab groups is consistent with the mechanism of action of dupilumab, which inhibits signaling of IL-4 and IL-13, key drivers of type 2 immune diseases.

### Infections in patients with atopic dermatitis and the influence of treatment [^86cb037e]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Viral Infections

Antiviral drugs for the treatment of eczema herpeticum include acyclovir, valacyclovir, famciclovir and foscarnet for acute infections; acyclovir and valacyclovir are also used for long-term suppressive therapy. Foscarnet is the recommended therapy for acyclovir-resistant HSV infections. The treatment for eczema coxsackium is similar to that of AD treatment, including skin hydration and moisturisation and use of TCS. As molluscum contagiosum is usually benign, observation is generally recommended, but topical cantharidin or 5% potassium hydroxide solution can be used in paediatric patients.

Fungal Infections

The antifungal ketoconazole is an imidazole derivative that exhibits anti-inflammatory effects as well as anti-erythema and anti-oedema properties. In a Swedish study, treatment with oral ketoconazole 200 mg/day for 2 months and 200 mg twice a week for another 3 months improved clinical AD severity and reduced the levels of total IgE, anti- Malassezia IgE and anti- C. albicans IgE. Antifungal imidazoles with a more favourable safety profile include itraconazole and fluconazole. Terbinafine can be safely used in dermatophyte infections.

### Phenotype of atopic dermatitis subjects with a history of eczema herpeticum [^08013f99]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

A subset of subjects with atopic dermatitis (AD) are susceptible to serious infections with herpes simplex virus, called eczema herpeticum, or vaccina virus, called eczema vaccinatum.

Objective

This National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases-funded multicenter study was performed to establish a database of clinical information and biologic samples on subjects with AD with and without a history of eczema herpeticum (ADEH(+) and ADEH(-) subjects, respectively) and healthy control subjects. Careful phenotyping of AD subsets might suggest mechanisms responsible for disseminated viral infections and help identify at-risk individuals.

We analyzed the data from 901 subjects (ADEH(+) subjects, n = 134; ADEH(-) subjects, n = 419; healthy control subjects, n = 348) enrolled between May 11, 2006, and September 16, 2008, at 7 US medical centers.

Results

ADEH(+) subjects had more severe disease based on scoring systems (Eczema Area and Severity Index and Rajka-Langeland score), body surface area affected, and biomarkers (circulating eosinophil counts and serum IgE, thymus and activation-regulated chemokine, and cutaneous T cell-attracting chemokine) than ADEH(-) subjects (P < .001). ADEH(+) subjects were also more likely to have a history of food allergy (69% vs 40%, P < .001) or asthma (64% vs 44%, P < .001) and were more commonly sensitized to many common allergens (P < .001). Cutaneous infections with Staphylococcus aureus or molluscum contagiosum virus were more common in ADEH(+) subjects (78% and 8%, respectively) than in ADEH(-) subjects (29% and 2%, respectively; P < .001).

Conclusion

Subjects with AD in whom eczema herpeticum develops have more severe T(H)2-polarized disease with greater allergen sensitization and more commonly have a history of food allergy, asthma, or both. They are also much more likely to experience cutaneous infections with S. aureus or molluscum contagiosum.

### When does atopic dermatitis warrant systemic therapy? Recommendations from an expert panel of the international eczema council [^524d1500]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Although most patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) are effectively managed with topical medication, a significant minority require systemic therapy. Guidelines for decision making about advancement to systemic therapy are lacking.

Objective

To guide those considering use of systemic therapy in AD and provide a framework for evaluation before making this therapeutic decision with the patient.

Methods

A subgroup of the International Eczema Council determined aspects to consider before prescribing systemic therapy. Topics were assigned to expert reviewers who performed a topic-specific literature review, referred to guidelines when available, and provided interpretation and expert opinion.

Results

We recommend a systematic and holistic approach to assess patients with severe signs and symptoms of AD and impact on quality of life before systemic therapy. Steps taken before commencing systemic therapy include considering alternate or concomitant diagnoses, avoiding trigger factors, optimizing topical therapy, ensuring adequate patient/caregiver education, treating coexistent infection, assessing the impact on quality of life, and considering phototherapy.

Limitations

Our work is a consensus statement, not a systematic review.

Conclusion

The decision to start systemic medication should include assessment of severity and quality of life while considering the individual's general health status, psychologic needs, and personal attitudes toward systemic therapies.

### The safety data of dupilumab for the treatment of moderate ‑ to ‑ severe atopic dermatitis in infants, children, adolescents, and adults [^01354949]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Adjudicated non-herpetic skin infections occurred in a higher proportion of patients receiving placebo than dupilumab in all age groups (Table 3). EAIRs of adjudicated non-herpetic skin infections were similar in the adult OLE and in dupilumab-treated patients in the 52-week RCT (4.6 and 4.1–6.1 nP/100PY, respectively; Table 4), while EAIRs in the PED-OLE for the child and adolescent cohorts were 10.9 and 8.5 nP/100PY, respectively (Table 4 of the ESM).

In the 16-week RCTs, the incidence of herpes viral infections (MedDRA HLT) was slightly lower in infants/children in dupilumab versus placebo groups, but rates in adolescents/adults were slightly higher in dupilumab versus placebo groups (Table 3). In contrast, herpes viral infections in the 52-week RCT occurred at similar rates across treatment groups. In the adult OLE, the EAIR of herpes viral infections at 5 years was lower than in dupilumab-treated patients in the 52-week RCT (6.6 vs 7.7–8.2 nP/100PY; Table 4). The MedDRA PTs eczema herpeticum and herpes zoster each occurred in < 1% of patients in the 16-week RCTs and were less frequent in dupilumab-treated patients than patients receiving placebo across all ages (Table 3). In the 52-week RCT, these infections were more frequent in the placebo + TCS group (1.9% and 1.6% of patients, respectively) than in the dupilumab + TCS groups (< 1%; Table 3). In the adult OLE and PED-OLE, eczema herpeticum rates were low and similar to the respective age groups in the comparable RCTs, while herpes zoster EAIRs were higher in the adult OLE than in the 52-week RCT (Table 4; Tables 3 and 4 of the ESM). In the few dupilumab-treated patients who developed eczema herpeticum, these events resolved during treatment and did not lead to treatment discontinuation or hospitalization.

### Infections in patients with atopic dermatitis and the influence of treatment [^a7f178e1]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

AD constitutes a risk factor for the colonisation and transmission of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA); patients with AD have ten-fold higher rates of MRSA colonisation compared with the general population. MRSA is mostly transmitted through close contact with other family members, especially in children, but it can also be transmitted through shared items such as soap, towels, toilet handles, doorknobs, kitchen sinks or even household pets. Compared with methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA), MRSA produces more superantigens and causes significantly more SSTI infections.

Viral Infections

Recurrent viral infections are also prevalent in AD lesions but are relatively less common than bacterial infections. Common causative viruses include HSV, varicella zoster virus, cytomegalovirus and Epstein–Barr virus. Patients with AD may be predisposed to viral skin infections due to genetic variations in selected innate immune response molecules including thymic stromal lymphopoietin, interferon (IFN) α, β, γ and ω and IFN regulatory factor 2. Activation of the STAT6 gene also increases viral replication in patients with AD.

One of the most common viral infections in patients with AD is HSV infection, which causes eczema herpeticum, mostly as a simultaneous occurrence with S. aureus infection. Eczema herpeticum mostly arises in AD lesions on the face, neck, upper trunk and antecubital/popliteal areas, and is often accompanied by fever, malaise, lymphadenopathy, keratoconjunctivitis and potentially encephalitis and septic shock, which can be fatal. Risk factors include moderate-to-severe AD, early onset AD, presence of FLG LOF mutations, a history of S. aureus skin infection, presence of other allergic diseases, greater allergen sensitisation (i.e. high total serum IgE or peripheral eosinophils) and a Th2 immune response. Mechanisms of eczema herpeticum development involve downregulation of IFN-γ and receptors for IFN-α, β, γ and ω, and S. aureus α-toxin-induced replication of HSV.

Molluscum contagiosum is a common skin condition caused by a poxvirus belonging to the Molluscipoxvirus subfamily. In patients with AD, molluscum contagiosum can spread either in a diffuse manner or along the AD distribution. Less common viral infections of the skin include eczema coxsackium and eczema vaccinatum (Table 1).

### Chemotherapy-mediated complications of wound healing: an understudied side effect [^584eaae6]. Advances in Wound Care (2024). Medium credibility.

MEK inhibitors are associated with an increased risk of inflammatory skin rash characterized by papulopustular eruptions and dermatitis acneiform. A rash, or folliculitis, is a typical response to systemic treatment. It occurs in 43% to 85% of patients treated with targeted systemic therapies. Xerosis cutis, a condition characterized by abnormally dry skin, may develop in 35% of patients, even several weeks after systemic therapy. Such a strong drying, in the event of an exacerbation, can cause asteatotic eczema.

It may be complicated by secondary Staphylococcus aureus or Herpes simplex infections. Xerosis cutis and the resulting eczema are often correlated with the patient's age and the tendency to develop atopic dermatitis. Very dry hand skin causes a feeling of pain in the fingers or the formation of fissures on the dorsal sides of the interphalangeal joints. Chemotherapy can also cause other discomforts to the skin and epidermis, leading to reactions such as transient erythema, discoloration, nail changes, and hand–foot syndrome. Immunosuppression is one of the side effects of chemotherapeutics. The inhibition of inflammatory response in the early stages of wound healing impairs the healing process. Reduced activity of neutrophils and macrophages increases the risk of wound infection and delays the removal of dead tissue through phagocytosis. This can often lead to a chronic wound. Chronic wounds are defined as those that do not heal for three months or more.

The most severe complication is hand–foot syndrome. This condition is initially characterized by numbness in the hands and feet, tingling, or burning pain. In the advanced stage, it can cause ulceration and blisters, mainly affecting the palmar and plantar surfaces. It is related to the use of capecitabine and other 5-fluorouracil derivatives. The pathophysiology is not yet well characterized. However, the existing damage to the epithelial cells of the eccrine ducts suggests that basal keratinocytes may be affected.

Some chemotherapy drugs induce venous irritation. These drugs are commonly known as blistering agents. They can cause severe tissue damage, leading to a nonhealing necrotizing ulcer. This kind of toxicity is demanding and requires long treatment. The characteristic symptoms include significant pain and disfigurement. In extreme cases, the condition is associated with nerve damage, which may lead to the loss of limb functionality or even amputation.

A complication affecting the nails is paronychia, an inflammatory reaction of the nail folds resulting from epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors. It is challenging to treat and leads to infections.

### Eczema monkeypoxicum: report of monkeypox transmission in a patient with atopic dermatitis [^7c9bb4bf]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cases of West African clade monkeypox (WACM) have been increasing since May 2022. As of July 28, 2022, case counts were 4639 cases in the United States and 20,638 internationally. Human-to-human transmission is thought to be driving this outbreak, with many early cases reported in the men who have sex with men (MSM) community. Close contact with respiratory droplets, monkeypox lesion material, and diseased animals are currently known mechanisms of transmission.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) compromises the skin barrier, occasionally leading to superimposed infection. Several known viral examples include eczema herpeticum (EH), eczema coxsackium, and eczema vaccinatum. In particular, EH is a well-described phenomenon in which herpes simplex virus may cause disseminated infection, encephalitis, hepatitis, and death even in immunocompetent patients. The causative virus in this case can be spread via direct contact or reactivation. Patients with EH tend to display earlier-onset AD, stronger type 2 immune responses, and decreased levels of the expression of antimicrobial peptides, which may contribute to increased susceptibility. The pathogenesis of EH can thus provide a framework with which to understand monkeypox transmission in patients with AD.

Here, we present the first described case of WACM associated with eczema. We urge practitioners to keep monkeypox in the differential for not only the MSM community, but also the general population and those with dermatoses that cause barrier compromise.

### Rosacea fulminans herpeticum: rosacea fulminans with superimposed herpetic infection [^3d0eb7ca]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Rosacea fulminans (RF) follows an explosive clinical course with progression of centrofacial plaques and interconnecting sinuses within 1–2 weeks. Onset is often reported after a trigger, including hormonal shifts such as pregnancy, emotional stress, medications, or, as in our case, alcohol consumption. Rosacea fulminans is distinguished from severe acne by lack of comedones among the erythematous papules and nodules associated with the eruption in most cases. Further, 92% of RF cases occur in women, and 80% of cases report a prior history of flushing or rosacea. Although it does not feature in the National Rosacea Society classification at present, it appears likely that RF is an extremely inflammatory variant of rosacea.

Treatment of RF has developed greatly over time. Currently, a combination of systemic corticosteroids and/or isotretinoin is recommended. Withdrawal of systemic corticosteroids can lead to flaring of symptoms; therefore, a slow taper over 2–3 weeks is advised. Oral antibiotics, such as tetracyclines, macrolides, and dapsone, have been used but are often ineffective as monotherapy. Erythromycin is preferred in pregnant patients but rarely leads to resolution of symptoms. Isotretinoin is initiated in many cases after delivery to facilitate the resolution.

So far, rosacea fulminans herpeticum has not been reported in the literature. However, Kaposi varicelliform eruption is a well-documented phenomenon and refers to a disseminated cutaneous infection of HSV 1 or 2, coxsackievirus A16, or vaccinia virus in association with an underlying dermatosis. Eczema herpeticum is specific to atopic dermatitis with superimposed HSV. Most commonly seen in the setting of atopic dermatitis, both Eczema herpeticum and Kaposi varicelliform eruption have been reported in patients with psoriasis, keratosis follicularis, bullous pemphigoid, contact dermatitis, second degree burns, and skin grafts among others. Skin barrier impairment is the greatest risk factor for development of Eczema herpeticum and Kaposi varicelliform eruption, and with the added pervasiveness of latent HSV infection, recognition of those at risk is critically important.

### Delgocitinib (Anzupgo) [^2be0e035]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

MEDICATION GUIDE

ANZUPGO®(an zup goe)

(delgocitinib) cream

Important: ANZUPGO is for use on the skin (topical use) only. Do not use ANZUPGO in or on your eyes, mouth, or vagina.

What is the most important information I should know about ANZUPGO?

ANZUPGO may cause serious side effects, including:

Serious Infections. ANZUPGO may increase your risk of infections. ANZUPGO contains delgocitinib. Delgocitinib belongs to a class of medicines called Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors. JAK inhibitors are medicines that affect your immune system. JAK inhibitors can lower the ability of your immune system to fight infections. Some people have had serious infections while taking JAK inhibitors by mouth or applying on the skin, including tuberculosis (TB), and infections caused by bacteria, fungi, or viruses that can spread throughout the body. Some people have been hospitalized or died from these infections. Before starting ANZUPGO, tell your healthcare provider if you: After starting ANZUPGO, call your healthcare provider right away if you have any symptoms of an infection.

ANZUPGO can make you more likely to get infections or make worse any infections that you have. If you get a serious infection, your healthcare provider may stop your treatment with ANZUPGO until your infection is controlled.
ANZUPGO should not be used in people with an active, serious infection. You should not start using ANZUPGO if you have any kind of infection unless your healthcare provider tells you it is okay. You may be at a higher risk of developing shingles (herpes zoster) or eczema herpeticum (a blistery, painful skin rash) during treatment with ANZUPGO.
are being treated for an infection
have an infection that does not go away or that keeps coming back
have TB or have been in close contact with someone with TB
have had shingles (herpes zoster)
have had hepatitis B or C
think you have an infection or have symptoms of an infection such as:
fever, sweating, or chills
muscle aches
cough or shortness of breath
blood in your phlegm
weight loss
warm, red, or painful skin or sores on your body
diarrhea or stomach pain
burning when you urinate or
urinating more often than usual
feeling very tired
Non-melanoma skin cancer. ANZUPGO may increase your risk of certain non-melanoma skin cancers. Your healthcare provider will regularly check your skin during your treatment with ANZUPGO.
Avoid sunlamps and limit the amount of time you spend in the sunlight. Wear protective clothing when you are in the sun or use a broad-spectrum sunscreen.
Tell your healthcare provider if you have ever had any type of cancer.
Potential risks from Janus kinase (JAK) inhibition. It is not known whether using ANZUPGO has the same risks as taking other oral or topical JAK inhibitors. Increased risk of death (all causes) has happened in people who were 50 years of age and older with at least 1 heart disease (cardiovascular) risk factor who were taking a JAK inhibitor used to treat rheumatoid arthritis (RA) compared to people taking another medicine in a class of medicines called TNF blockers. ANZUPGO is not for use in people with RA. Other oral or topical JAK inhibitors have also caused increased cholesterol.

### Identification of novel gene signatures in patients with atopic dermatitis complicated by eczema herpeticum [^562c5f79]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

A subset of patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) is prone to disseminated herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection (ie, atopic dermatitis with a history of eczema herpeticum [ADEH+]). Biomarkers that identify ADEH+ are lacking.

Objective

We sought to search for novel ADEH+ gene signatures in PBMCs.

Methods

An RNA-sequencing approach was applied to evaluate global transcriptional changes by using PBMCs from patients with ADEH+ and patients with atopic dermatitis without a history of eczema herpeticum (ADEH-). Candidate genes were confirmed by means of quantitative PCR or ELISA.

Results

PBMCs from patients with ADEH+ had distinct changes to the transcriptome when compared with those from patients with ADEH- after HSV-1 stimulation: 792 genes were differentially expressed at a false discovery rate of less than 0.05 (ANOVA), and 15 type I and type III interferon genes were among the top 20 most downregulated genes in patients with ADEH+. We further validated that IFN-α and IL-29 mRNA and protein levels were significantly decreased in HSV-1-stimulated PBMCs from patients with ADEH+ compared with those from patients with ADEH- and healthy subjects. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis demonstrated that the upstream regulators of type I and type III interferons, interferon regulatory factor (IRF) 3 and IRF7, were significantly inhibited in patients with ADEH+ based on the downregulation of their target genes. Furthermore, we found that gene expression of IRF3 and IRF7 was significantly decreased in HSV-1-stimulated PBMCs from patients with ADEH+.

Conclusions

PBMCs from patients with ADEH+ have a distinct immune response after HSV-1 exposure compared with those from patients with ADEH-. Inhibition of the IRF3 and IRF7 innate immune pathways in patients with ADEH+ might be an important mechanism for increased susceptibility to disseminated viral infection.

### Infections in dupilumab clinical trials in atopic dermatitis: a comprehensive pooled analysis [^539cd119]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

c MedDRA HLT

d Excluding herpesviral infections; data not available for R668-AD-1117

e Includes all infections other than those listed in the MedDRA HLT skin structures and soft tissue infections

Overall, a higher proportion of patients in the placebo group than in the dupilumab group discontinued for any reason (18.3% vs. 8.0%, placebo vs. dupilumab combined; 42.59 vs. 18.48 patients per 100 PY, respectively; p < 0.0001). Very few patients permanently discontinued study treatment because of infections (five patients in the placebo group and three in the dupilumab groups combined), and there were no significant differences in discontinuation rates between treatment groups (Table 1 and Fig. 1 a; and Table E3 in the ESM). Infections that led to treatment discontinuation in the placebo group were, by MedDRA PT, cytomegalovirus infection, infected dermatitis, eczema herpeticum, bacterial endocarditis, molluscum contagiosum, sepsis, and septic embolus (one case each; one patient who discontinued had three infectious TEAEs [bacterial endocarditis, sepsis, and septic embolus]). Infections that led to treatment discontinuation in the dupilumab groups were conjunctivitis, eczema impetiginous, and folliculitis (one case each).

### Kaposi varicelliform eruption in a patient with epidermolysis bullosa simplex generalized severe [^4b6ed43d]. JAAD Case Reports (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

This case report is an original presentation of Kaposi varicelliform infection in a patient with generalized EB. HSV is highly prevalent and endemic throughout the world. Kaposi varicelliform eruptions are potentially life-threatening infections caused by HSV infection over a preexisting dermatosis. These eruptions often manifest as febrile eruptions of dome-chapped blisters and hemorrhagic crusting but may also present as erosions without vesicles or pustules and worsening of a preexisting dermatosis. The upper body is the most common site of infection, with a predilection for the head and neck. In some cases, the infection may progress to a fulminating, life-threatening stage and can have severe sequelae, including herpes keratitis, disseminated infection with visceral involvement, and death. The most common form is eczema herpeticum on atopic dermatitis. Although eczema herpeticum is rare, a subset of patients with atopic dermatitis seems to have a predisposition for HSV infection because of defects in specific proteins critical for skin barrier functionand innate immunity. Other cases have been described in conjunction with Grover's disease, bullous pemphigoid, Darier disease, Hailey-Hailey disease, burns, and Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome.

To our knowledge, only 1 other article reported a case of herpetic infection in a child affected with EB. The patient presented a gingival-stomatitis in a dystrophic EB.

In a multicenter observational study of hospitalized children with eczema herpeticum, the delayed initiation of acyclovir therapy was associated with increased length of stay. This study's findings emphasize the importance of early acyclovir therapy for children with eczema herpeticum. Our patient was hospitalized for 12 days, and acyclovir therapy was initiated after 5 days of hospitalization. The case highlights the importance of the diagnosis of herpetic infection of EB lesions in the case of an unclear source of fever because the best prognosis is correlated with early diagnosis and prompt treatment. However, a prompt diagnosis of an infectious blistering disease on top of a mechanical blistering disease can be tricky to discern.

### Clinical guidance for smallpox vaccine use in a postevent vaccination program [^e221207b]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

CDC smallpox vaccine guidance — evidence base and development process states that the primary evidence base came from literature searches of PubMed, manual searches of experts' libraries, and communication with manufacturers and researchers; nonsystematic searches used standard engines with terms including "ACAM2000", "Imvamune", "Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA)", and "Aventis Pasteur Smallpox Vaccine (APSV)". Identified publications were screened against predefined criteria, including randomized clinical trials involving ACAM2000, Imvamune, or APSV; surveillance data from the historic use of Dryvax in the United States from the 1960s; and cohort studies, survey studies, case series, and case reports of vaccine complications among persons with atopic dermatitis (eczema), persons with HIV infection, pregnant women, and pediatric populations, while exclusions were publications without abstracts, non‑English articles, policy guidelines, editorials, and review articles. Panel members reviewed a literature summary and were asked to apply professional experience and clinical judgment in assessing the quality of evidence and evaluating the risks and benefits of each vaccine. Draft recommendations were developed by CDC and select expert panel members before the workshop, then revised based on workshop input and distributed for broader review; the final CDC recommendations represent the current state of knowledge on smallpox vaccines and their recommended use and will be updated as more data on vaccine safety and efficacy become available.
