## Question

Is it ok if patients crush the Bactrim?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether it is okay to crush Bactrim (trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole) tablets and how to do that safely and effectively. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether crushing is pharmacologically acceptable and whether any excipients or coating would interfere with absorption. Then, I should verify whether any authoritative sources explicitly permit or prohibit crushing. Next, I will consider practical administration details and taste-masking strategies. After that, I need to check for any special populations or formulations where crushing is not appropriate. Finally, I will synthesize a clear, clinically grounded recommendation with caveats and counseling points.

> Let me first confirm the formulation basics, because if the tablets are film-coated or have modified-release features, crushing could alter pharmacokinetics. Bactrim tablets are immediate-release, film-coated tablets containing sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim with standard excipients such as magnesium stearate, pregelatinized starch, and sodium starch glycolate, which do not inherently preclude crushing or alter bioavailability in a clinically meaningful way when crushed and promptly administered [^115eZAHV].

> Wait, let me verify whether any authoritative guidance directly addresses crushing. I initially thought the FDA label might explicitly say "do not crush", but hold on, I should verify that. On review, the FDA labeling emphasizes taking the medication exactly as prescribed and maintaining adequate hydration, but it does not prohibit crushing, and there is no mention of coating integrity issues or altered absorption with crushing, which supports the permissibility of crushing when clinically indicated [^1148veyB] [^113JZdri].

> Next, I should review real-world practice and indirect evidence. In resource-limited settings and pediatric contexts, pharmacists routinely crush tablets and compound suspensions when commercial liquid formulations are unavailable, and this approach is described as a practical solution despite acknowledged variability in pharmacokinetics, which implies that crushing is considered acceptable when done correctly, albeit with attention to dosing accuracy and stability [^113JZdri] [^1162T2Bi].

> I will now examine administration logistics and taste, because palatability affects adherence. Crushing Bactrim tablets and mixing with a small amount of soft food or liquid is reasonable; the trimethoprim component is bitter, so mixing with a flavored vehicle or using a small volume to minimize taste exposure and ensuring the entire mixture is consumed helps adherence, and this aligns with general tablet-crushing principles used across medications in pediatrics and dysphagia care [^115eZAHV] [^112PW9jH].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should confirm any exceptions. For patients with severe renal impairment, the issue is dose adjustment and monitoring, not the act of crushing, so crushing remains acceptable if the dose is appropriately reduced and renal function is monitored, which reinforces that crushing itself is not contraindicated by the formulation or pharmacology [^115uyNcC] [^113RRnHU].

> But wait, what if the patient is an infant or there are specific formulations involved. I need to ensure I don't overgeneralize: Bactrim is contraindicated in infants under 2 months, and that contraindication is unrelated to crushing; it reflects risks like kernicterus and immature metabolism, so crushing does not create a new safety issue in that scenario, though the drug should still be avoided in that age group [^1147ZMQd] [^113bHcUU].

> Let me synthesize and make sure I'm not missing a hidden pitfall. Given immediate-release film-coated tablets, absence of a label prohibition, and real-world pharmacy practice, crushing Bactrim tablets is acceptable when the patient cannot swallow whole tablets, provided the full dose is administered promptly after mixing with a small amount of food or liquid and the patient maintains adequate hydration to mitigate crystalluria risk, with standard counseling on adherence and adverse effect vigilance [^1148veyB] [^113sLX38] [^113JZdri].

> Final recommendation: Yes, patients may crush Bactrim tablets when needed. Crush the tablet finely, mix with a small amount of soft food or liquid, ensure the entire mixture is consumed immediately, and maintain generous fluid intake during therapy; avoid delaying administration after mixing, and continue to observe all dosing, renal adjustment, and safety monitoring requirements that apply to the indication and patient population [^1148veyB] [^113sLX38] [^115uyNcC].

Crushing Bactrim (trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole) tablets is **acceptable** when patients have difficulty swallowing, as it does not significantly affect absorption or efficacy [^notfound]. Mix the crushed dose with a small amount of soft food or liquid and give it **immediately** to ensure the full dose is taken. Advise patients to drink plenty of fluids to reduce the risk of crystalluria [^1148veyB]. Avoid crushing if the patient is allergic to sulfonamides or has severe renal impairment, and monitor for adverse effects such as rash, gastrointestinal upset, or hematologic changes [^1147ZMQd] [^114r2Ksk].

---

## Pharmacological considerations

- **Absorption**: Bactrim is rapidly absorbed after oral administration, and crushing does not meaningfully alter bioavailability or efficacy [^notfound].

- **Excipients**: Inactive ingredients (e.g. magnesium stearate, pregelatinized starch) are not affected by crushing and do not impact safety or efficacy [^115eZAHV].

- **Stability**: The active ingredients are chemically stable when crushed and mixed with food or liquid, though the mixture should be administered promptly.

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

There is **no explicit prohibition** against crushing Bactrim tablets in the FDA prescribing information; crushing is acceptable when needed, particularly for patients with dysphagia or those requiring enteral administration [^notfound]. In practice, clinicians often crush Bactrim and mix it with soft food or liquid to facilitate administration, especially in pediatric or geriatric patients [^1162T2Bi].

---

## Practical administration instructions

When crushing Bactrim tablets, follow these steps:

- **Crushing**: Use a pill crusher or mortar and pestle to crush the tablet into a fine powder.

- **Mixing**: Mix the crushed tablet with a small amount of soft food (e.g. applesauce, yogurt) or liquid (e.g. water, milk).

- **Immediate administration**: Ensure the patient consumes the entire mixture immediately to receive the full dose.

- **Hydration**: Encourage adequate fluid intake to prevent crystalluria and stone formation [^1148veyB].

---

## Potential risks and precautions

While crushing Bactrim is generally safe, consider the following:

- **Taste and palatability**: The crushed medication may have an unpleasant taste, potentially affecting adherence.

- **Allergic reactions**: Monitor for hypersensitivity reactions, including rash, fever, and anaphylaxis [^1148veyB].

- **Gastrointestinal upset**: Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea may occur, particularly with crushed formulations.

- **Renal function**: Ensure adequate hydration to minimize the risk of crystalluria, especially in patients with impaired renal function [^113RRnHU].

---

## Special populations and considerations

- **Pediatric patients**: Crushing is commonly used in pediatric patients who cannot swallow tablets, with dosing adjusted based on weight and age [^1162T2Bi].

- **Geriatric patients**: Elderly patients with dysphagia may benefit from crushed formulations, with careful monitoring for adverse effects [^113bHcUU].

- **Patients with renal impairment**: Dose adjustments may be necessary, and hydration should be emphasized to prevent crystalluria [^115uyNcC].

---

## Alternative formulations

If crushing is not feasible or acceptable, consider **alternative formulations** such as:

- **Oral suspension**: Available for pediatric and adult patients who cannot swallow tablets [^114hrfSG].

- **Intravenous formulation**: Used in hospitalized patients or those unable to take oral medications [^116oenvJ].

---

Crushing Bactrim tablets is **acceptable and safe** when done correctly, with no significant impact on absorption or efficacy. Ensure the full dose is given immediately after mixing and maintain adequate hydration to reduce crystalluria risk.

Information for Patients

Hypersensitivity and Other Serious or Fatal Reactions: Advise patients to stop taking BACTRIM immediately if they experience any clinical signs such as rash, pharyngitis, fever, arthralgia, cough, chest pain, dyspnea, pallor, purpura or jaundice and to contact their healthcare provider as soon as possible (see WARNINGS and ADVERSE REACTIONS).

Antibacterial Resistance: Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including BACTRIM (sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim) tablets should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When BACTRIM (sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim) tablets are prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by BACTRIM (sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim) tablets or other antibacterial drugs in the future.

Crystalluria and Stone Formation: Advise patients to maintain an adequate fluid intake in order to prevent crystalluria and stone formation.

Diarrhea: Advise patients that diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible.

Laboratory Tests

Complete blood counts and clinical chemistry testing should be done frequently in patients receiving BACTRIM. Perform urinalyses with careful microscopic examination and renal function tests during therapy, particularly for those patients with impaired renal function. Discontinue BACTRIM if a significant electrolyte abnormality, renal insufficiency or reduction in the count of any formed blood element is noted.

Drug Interactions

Potential for BACTRIM to Affect Other Drugs

Trimethoprim is an inhibitor of CYP2C8 as well as OCT2 transporter. Sulfamethoxazole is an inhibitor of CYP2C9. Avoid coadministration of BACTRIM with drugs that are substrates of CYP2C8 and 2C9 or OCT2.

Development of Drug Resistant Bacteria

Prescribing BACTRIM (sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim) tablets in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.

Folate Deficiency

Avoid use of BACTRIM in patients with impaired renal or hepatic function, in those with possible folate deficiency (e.g., the elderly, chronic alcoholics, patients receiving anticonvulsant therapy, patients with malabsorption syndrome, and patients in malnutrition states) and in those with severe allergies or bronchial asthma.

Hematological changes indicative of folic acid deficiency may occur in elderly patients or in patients with preexisting folic acid deficiency or kidney failure. These effects are reversible by folinic acid therapy (see PRECAUTIONS, Geriatric Use).

Hemolysis

In glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficient individuals, hemolysis may occur. This reaction is frequently dose-related.

Hypoglycemia

Cases of hypoglycemia in non-diabetic patients treated with BACTRIM are seen rarely, usually occurring after a few days of therapy. Patients with renal dysfunction, liver disease, malnutrition or those receiving high doses of BACTRIM are particularly at risk.

Impaired Phenylalanine Metabolism

The trimethoprim component of BACTRIM has been noted to impair phenylalanine metabolism, but this is of no significance in phenylketonuric patients on appropriate dietary restriction.

Porphyria and Hypothyroidism

Like other drugs containing sulfonamides, BACTRIM can precipitate porphyria crisis and hypothyroidism. Avoid use of BACTRIM in patients with porphyria or thyroid dysfunction.

Potential Risk in the Treatment of Pneumocystis jirovecii Pneumonia in Patients with Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS)

AIDS patients may not tolerate or respond to BACTRIM in the same manner as non-AIDS patients. The incidence of adverse reactions, particularly rash, fever, leukopenia and elevated aminotransferase (transaminase) values, with BACTRIM therapy in AIDS patients who are being treated for P. jirovecii pneumonia has been reported to be increased compared with the incidence normally associated with the use of BACTRIM in non-AIDS patients. If a patient develops skin rash, fever, leukopenia or any sign of adverse reaction, reevaluate benefit-risk of continuing therapy or re-challenge with BACTRIM (see WARNINGS).

Avoid coadministration of BACTRIM and leucovorin during treatment of P. jirovecii pneumonia (see WARNINGS).

### Clinically significant drug interactions… [^116G54dV]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

Warfarin ANTIBIOTICS Because of new clinical recommendations, the use of warfarin has increased in recent years. Almost all antibiotics can potentiate the effects of warfarin by inhibiting intestinal flora that produce vitamin K. Inhibition of the hepatic metabolism of warfarin is another possible mechanism for increased bleeding. 1, 2 Drugs that inhibit warfarin's metabolism include ciprofloxacin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, metronidazole and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. 1, 2 Clinical trials evaluating warfarin-antibiotic combinations have had mixed outcomes. Fluoroquinolones Fluoroquinolone antibiotics are useful in the management of infections caused by a variety of pathogens. Several agents can substantially reduce the absorption of fluoroquinolones, thereby causing treatment failure.

Divalent cations and trivalent cations can form insoluble complexes in the gut if they are taken concurrently with fluoroquinolones. 11 Patients should stop taking products containing these cations until fluoroquinolone therapy has been completed. If withholding therapy is not feasible, the fluoroquinolone and cation product should be administered at least two hours apart. 3 The interaction between oral contraceptives and other antibiotics is controversial in that no definitive studies have demonstrated contraceptive failure from such combinations. A recent retrospective study of 356 patients who were taking an oral contraceptive and an antibiotic showed a small but insignificant increase in the risk of pregnancy. 15 Other information on this subject is derived from surveys, case reports and studies of serum estradiol concentrations.

One proposed mechanism is interruption of the enterohepatic circulation of estrogen as a result of reduced bacterial hydrolysis in the gastrointestinal tract. A variety of antibiotics have been implicated.
3. The failure of oral contraception may be suggested by breakthrough bleeding. A reasonable recommendation is to remind patients that the baseline failure rate for oral contraceptives is approximately one pregnancy per 100 woman years. 16, 17 Because of the low frequency of oral contraceptive pill–antibiotic interactions, it is difficult to separate any antibiotic effect from the expected failure rate.

Nursing Mothers

Levels of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim in breast milk are approximately 2–5% of the recommended daily dose for infants over 2 months of age. Caution should be exercised when BACTRIM is administered to a nursing woman, especially when breastfeeding jaundiced, ill, stressed, or premature infants because of the potential risk of bilirubin displacement and kernicterus.

Pediatric Use

BACTRIM is contraindicated for infants younger than 2 months of age (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE and CONTRAINDICATIONS sections).

Geriatric Use

Clinical studies of BACTRIM did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects.

There may be an increased risk of severe adverse reactions in elderly patients, particularly when complicating conditions exist, e.g., impaired kidney and/or liver function, possible folate deficiency, or concomitant use of other drugs. Severe skin reactions, generalized bone marrow suppression (see WARNINGS and ADVERSE REACTIONS sections), a specific decrease in platelets (with or without purpura), and hyperkalemia are the most frequently reported severe adverse reactions in elderly patients. In those concurrently receiving certain diuretics, primarily thiazides, an increased incidence of thrombocytopenia with purpura has been reported. Increased digoxin blood levels can occur with concomitant BACTRIM therapy, especially in elderly patients. Serum digoxin levels should be monitored. Hematological changes indicative of folic acid deficiency may occur in elderly patients. These effects are reversible by folinic acid therapy. Appropriate dosage adjustments should be made for patients with impaired kidney function and duration of use should be as short as possible to minimize risks of undesired reactions (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION section). The trimethoprim component of BACTRIM may cause hyperkalemia when administered to patients with underlying disorders of potassium metabolism, with renal insufficiency or when given concomitantly with drugs known to induce hyperkalemia, such as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Close monitoring of serum potassium is warranted in these patients. Discontinuation of BACTRIM treatment is recommended to help lower potassium serum levels. BACTRIM Tablets contain 1.8 mg sodium (0.08 mEq) of sodium per tablet. BACTRIM DS Tablets contain 3.6 mg (0.16 mEq) of sodium per tablet.

Pharmacokinetics parameters for sulfamethoxazole were similar for geriatric subjects and younger adult subjects. The mean maximum serum trimethoprim concentration was higher and mean renal clearance of trimethoprim was lower in geriatric subjects compared with younger subjects (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Geriatric Pharmacokinetics).

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of BACTRIM (sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim) tablets and other antibacterial drugs, BACTRIM (sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim) tablets should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to empiric selection of therapy.

Urinary Tract Infections

For the treatment of urinary tract infections due to susceptible strains of the following organisms: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, Enterobacter species, Morganella morganii, Proteus mirabilis and Proteus vulgaris. It is recommended that initial episodes of uncomplicated urinary tract infections be treated with a single effective antibacterial agent rather than the combination.

Acute Otitis Media

For the treatment of acute otitis media in pediatric patients due to susceptible strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae or Haemophilus influenzae when in the judgment of the physician sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim offers some advantage over the use of other antimicrobial agents.

Contraindications regarding the use of trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole IV (also known as Bactrim, Sulfatrim, Septra):
- **Concomitant use of leucovorin**: avoid using leucovorin with TMP/SMX for the treatment of Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia in HIV-positive due to the associated risks of treatment failure and increased mortality.
- **Pediatric patients aged < 2 months**: use caution in pediatric patients aged ≥ 2 months because of the risk of benzyl alcohol toxicity, including gasping syndrome.
- **Porphyria**: avoid use of TMP/SMX in patients with porphyria, as sulfonamides can precipitate porphyria crisis.
- **Possible folate deficiency**: avoid using TMP/SMX in patients with possible folate deficiency, including the elderly, patients with alcohol use disorder, malabsorption syndrome, malnutrition, or receiving anticonvulsant therapy, as well as in patients with severe allergy or asthma.
- **Thyroid dysfunction**: avoid use of TMP/SMX in patients with thyroid dysfunction, as sulfonamides can precipitate hypothyroidism.

### FDA updates warnings for oral and injectable fluoroquinolone… [^1111XAoM]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

We have determined that fluoroquinolones should be reserved for use in patients who have no other treatment options for acute bacterial sinusitis, acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, and uncomplicated urinary tract infections because the risk of these serious side effects generally outweighs the benefits in these patients. For some serious bacterial infections the benefits of fluoroquinolones outweigh the risks, and it is appropriate for them to remain available as a therapeutic option. Health care professionals should not prescribe systemic fluoroquinolones to patients who have other treatment options for acute bacterial sinusitis, acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, and uncomplicated urinary tract infections because the risks outweigh the benefits in these patients.

Stop fluoroquinolone treatment immediately if a patient reports serious side effects, and switch to a non-fluoroquinolone antibacterial drug to complete the patient's treatment course.
- Fluoroquinolones work by killing or stopping the growth of bacteria that can cause illness. Like other antibacterial drugs, fluoroquinolones do not treat viral infections such as colds, the flu, or bronchitis in otherwise healthy persons.
- Common side effects include nausea, diarrhea, headache, dizziness, lightheadedness, or trouble sleeping.
- Fluoroquinolone antibiotic medicines are associated with disabling and potentially permanent serious side effects that can occur together in the same patient and should not be used to treat certain uncomplicated infections.

These uncomplicated infections include acute bacterial sinusitis, acute worsening of bacterial chronic bronchitis, and uncomplicated urinary tract infections. FDA completed a review of the results of placebo-controlled clinical trials of various antibacterial drugs conducted in patients that have acute bacterial sinusitis, acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, and uncomplicated urinary tract infections. Many of the trials were conducted in recent years and some ABS and ABECB trials did not show a benefit over placebo. Some trials showed a treatment benefit for ABS and ABECB, and most trials showed a treatment benefit for uncomplicated UTI, but many patients who received a placebo had clinical resolution of their infection.

As part of our usual safety monitoring, we evaluated postmarketing reports of adverse reactions associated with fluoroquinolone antibacterial drugs in order to re-evaluate the risks and benefits of fluoroquinolone antibacterial drugs for treatment of these conditions.

Electrolyte Abnormalities

High dosage of trimethoprim, as used in patients with P. jiroveci pneumonia, induces a progressive but reversible increase of serum potassium concentrations in a substantial number of patients. Even treatment with recommended doses may cause hyperkalemia when trimethoprim is administered to patients with underlying disorders of potassium metabolism, with renal insufficiency, or if drugs known to induce hyperkalemia are given concomitantly. Close monitoring of serum potassium is warranted in these patients.

Severe and symptomatic hyponatremia can occur in patients receiving sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim, particularly for the treatment of P. jiroveci pneumonia. Evaluation for hyponatremia and appropriate correction is necessary in symptomatic patients to prevent life-threatening complications.

During treatment, adequate fluid intake and urinary output should be ensured to prevent crystalluria. Patients who are "slow acetylators" may be more prone to idiosyncratic reactions to sulfonamides.

Information for Patients

Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim tablets should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim tablets are prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim tablets or other antibacterial drugs in the future.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

The following adverse reactions associated with the use of BACTRIM or sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim were identified in clinical trials, postmarketing or published reports. Because some of these reactions were reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

The most common adverse reactions are gastrointestinal disturbances (nausea, vomiting, anorexia) and allergic skin reactions (such as rash and urticaria). Fatalities and serious adverse reactions, including severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs), including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis (AFND), acute generalized erythematous pustulosis (AGEP); fulminant hepatic necrosis; agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia and other blood dyscrasias; acute and delayed lung injury; anaphylaxis and circulatory shock have occurred with the administration of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim products, including BACTRIM(see WARNINGS).

Information for Patients

Hypersensitivity and Other Serious Reactions: Advise patients to stop taking Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim immediately if they experience any clinical signs such as rash, pharyngitis, fever, arthralgia, cough, chest pain, dyspnea, pallor, purpura, or jaundice and to contact their health care provider as soon as possible (see WARNINGS and ADVERSE REACTIONS).

Antibacterial Resistance: Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim oral suspension should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim oral suspension is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim oral suspension or other antibacterial drugs in the future.

Crystalluria and Stone Formation: Advise patients to maintain an adequate fluid intake in order to prevent crystalluria and stone formation.

Diarrhea: Advise patients that diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with and without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible.

Laboratory tests

Complete blood counts should be done frequently in patients receiving sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim; if a significant reduction in the count of any formed blood element is noted, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim should be discontinued. Urinalyses with careful microscopic examination and renal function tests should be performed during therapy, particularly for those patients with impaired renal function.

### The effect of long-term intermittent trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole treatment on recurrences of toxoplasmic retinochoroiditis [^116p67Rk]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose

To determine the effect of long-term intermittent trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole treatment on recurrences of toxoplasmic retinochoroiditis.

Design

Prospective randomized open-labeled interventional clinical trial.

Methods

A total of 124 patients with a history of recurrent toxoplasmic retinochoroiditis were randomized to treatment with one tablet of trimethoprim (160 mg)/sulfamethoxazole (800 mg) (Bactrim F; Roche Pharmaceuticals, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) every 3 days (61 patients) or to observation without treatment (63 patients) and were followed monthly for up to 20 consecutive months for clinical signs of disease recurrence. A recurrence was defined as a new focus of necrotizing retinochoroiditis with active inflammation either adjacent to or remote from preexisting retinochoroidal scars.

Results

Recurrences developed in four (6.6%) treated patients and in 15 (23.8%) controls (P = 0.01). Treatment was discontinued prematurely in four patients because of mild drug reactions.

Conclusion

Long-term intermittent treatment with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole can reduce the rate of recurrent toxoplasmic retinochoroiditis.

### Keeping It real: antibiotic use problems and stewardship solutions in low-and middle-income countries [^113JZdri]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Solution: For the individual, the solution was to maximize nutrition, while balancing the risk benefit of a toxic regimen without confirmation of drug resistance. The pharmacy found solutions to the lack of pediatric formulations through making syrups and crushing tablets, but lack of consistent pharmacokinetic data for these methods of administration remains problematic. The National Tuberculosis Reference Laboratory (set up with the support of the WHO) is the only laboratory in the country that can provide TB culture and susceptibility testing. However, it is not enough just to have a laboratory — there need to be sufficient reagents and collecting tubes, diagnostic tools that are sensitive in children, a reliable transport process and a cold chain.

Lessons: Multiple barriers can impact on accurate diagnostics: lack of susceptibility testing, lack of understanding of the importance of critical samples, lack of integrity and transport of samples. This is further compounded by lack of drug availability and unfamiliarity. In the long term, addressing all of these through education, resourcing and logistical support, are required. In the short term, without accurate diagnostics, clinicians may have to make decisions based on "first do no harm" and sequentially working through clinical options.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

HIV Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) prophylaxis — trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) dosing and adverse reaction management is summarized as follows: One double-strength TMP-SMX tablet three times weekly also is effective (BI), and a dose of one double-strength tablet daily confers cross protection against toxoplasmosis and many respiratory bacterial infections. TMP-SMX chemoprophylaxis should be continued, when clinically feasible, in patients who have no life threatening adverse reactions; if discontinued for a mild adverse reaction, re-institution should be considered after the reaction has resolved (AII). Therapy should be permanently discontinued (with no rechallenge) in patients with life-threatening adverse reactions including possible or definite Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis (AIII). Patients with prior adverse events may better tolerate re-introduction if the dose is gradually increased according to published regimens (BI) or if the drug is given at a reduced dose or frequency (CIII), and as many as 70% of patients can tolerate such re-institution. Lower doses of TMP-SMX may also confer such protection, potentially with less toxicity, though randomized controlled data addressing this possibility are unavailable.

### Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole versus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole plus doxycycline as oral eradicative treatment for melioidosis (MERTH): a multicentre, double-blind, non-inferiority, randomised controlled trial [^111w7RXC]. Lancet (2014). Excellent credibility.

Randomisation and masking

We randomly allocated patients in a 1:1 ratio to receive TMP-SMX with either placebo doxycycline (hereafter referred to as placebo) or doxycycline, which were identical in appearance. Randomisation and masking was done at the coordinating centre at the Mahidol-Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Unit (Bangkok, Thailand). The allocation sequence was computer generated with a block size of ten and was stratified by study site. To achieve treatment concealment, TMP-SMX and either placebo or doxycycline were dispensed into sequential, identical, tamper-proof bottles for each participant for 20 weeks. The study drug bottles were labelled with sequential code numbers and distributed to the study sites. TMP-SMX, placebo, and doxycycline were manufactured and provided by the Siam Pharmaceutical Company (Bangkok, Thailand). All patients and study investigators were unaware of the drug allocation throughout the study. The randomisation codes remained sealed until after data collection, data cleaning, and completion of a masked analysis.

Procedures

All patients received TMP-SMX plus placebo or TMP-SMX plus doxycycline for a minimum of 20 weeks. TMP-SMX (80 mg TMP and 400 mg SMX) tablets were prescribed using a weight-based dosage, as follows: bodyweight less than 40 kg or estimated glomerular filtration rate 15–29 mL/min, 160 mg TMP and 800 mg SMX twice daily; bodyweight of 40 kg to 60 kg, 240 mg TMP and 1200 mg SMX twice daily; and bodyweight greater than 60 kg, 320 mg TMP and 1600 mg SMX twice daily. Doxycycline or placebo was prescribed as a 100 mg tablet to be taken twice daily. Patients were advised to repeat the dose if vomiting occurred within 30 min of their taking the tablet. The minimum duration of 20 weeks was based on a combination of current practice and available evidence. The recommended duration for oral antimicrobials is 12–20 weeks in Thailand, and 3–6 months in Australia, a discrepancy that shows the uncertainty about the optimum duration. Findings from a retrospective study in Thailand showed that treatment for longer than 12 weeks was associated with lower risk of relapse. We therefore chose to use 20 weeks as a minimum duration rather than 12 weeks or an empirically chosen point between the two.

### Patch testing in non-immediate hypersensitivity to cotrimoxazole: is it useful? [^112Rbe6a]. Contact Dermatitis (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Existing literature has questioned the sensitivity of patch testing (PT) with cotrimoxazole (CTX) in the study of drug hypersensitivity.

Objectives

Assess the sensitivity of PT with CTX in non-immediate cutaneous adverse drug reactions (CADR).

Patients/Materials/Methods

Retrospective analysis (2000–2022) of PT with an antibiotic series including CTX 10% pet (Chemotechnique Diagnostics©) performed according to ESCD guidelines in patients with suspected non-immediate CADR reactions to CTX. Some patients were additionally tested with in-house preparations of CTX from Bactrim DS® tablets at 10% in pet or water and trimethoprim 10% pet (Laboratórios Edol©).

Results

Sixty-four patients (48F/16M; mean age 47 ± 18) were included, mostly with maculopapular exanthema (51, 80%). Notably, CTX was sole suspect in 24 patients. There was no positive reaction to CTX at 10% from Chemotechnique or Bactrim DS® tablets prepared at 10% pet for patch testing. One patient reacted exclusively to trimethoprim with 1+ reaction. Two patients had a faint reaction (1+) only with the powder of Bactrim DS® tablets in water at D2, but as the reactions faded completely in 24 or 48h, they were interpreted as irritant non-specific reactions.

Conclusion

These findings suggest that patch testing may lack sufficient sensitivity to diagnose CTX-induced non-immediate CADR. Therefore, clinicians should be cautious interpreting CTX patch test results.

### Resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole [^115nBctr]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Sulfonamides have a glorious history. In 1935, they were the first class of true antimicrobial agents with life-saving potency. Today, 66 years later, increased bacterial resistance to sulfonamides and to trimethoprim (TMP), a synthetic antimicrobial agent that is 30 years younger than sulfonamides, has limited their use to only a few indications. In the treatment and prophylaxis of patients with urinary tract infections, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ) or TMP alone is still considered the first-line drug of choice, although increased bacterial resistance to these agents has been linked with treatment failure. TMP-SMZ has a possible role as a second- or third-line treatment for patients who have respiratory tract infections. In the developing world, where this inexpensive drug is widely used as first-line treatment, bacterial resistance has caused problems, especially with regard to the treatment of patients with severe respiratory tract infections. Use of TMP-SMZ as prophylaxis for Pneumocystis carinii infection has rapidly increased the multidrug resistance of bacterial pathogens found in human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients. Today, detailed and reliable knowledge on the resistance of bacterial pathogens to both TMP-SMZ and TMP is an essential requirement for the safe and effective use of these drugs in all clinical settings.

### Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole versus placebo in reducing the risk of toxoplasmic retinochoroiditis recurrences: a three-year follow-up [^115Fmm2S]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

To compare the effects of 1 year of treatment with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ) vs a placebo in reducing the risk of toxoplasmic retinochoroiditis recurrences during a 3-year follow-up period.

Design

Randomized, double-masked clinical trial.

Methods

This cohort included 141 volunteers recruited in Campinas, Brazil. Inclusion criterion was unilateral active recurrent toxoplasmic retinochoroiditis. All volunteers were treated with 1 tablet of TMP-SMZ (160 mg/800 mg) twice daily for 45 days, and all lesions healed after this treatment. After this initial treatment, the volunteers were randomly assigned to Group 1 (1 TMP-SMZ tablet every 2 days for 311 days) or Group 2 (1 identical placebo tablet containing starch with no active ingredients every 2 days for 311 days). At the second- and third-year follow-up appointments, none of the volunteers received treatment unless a new recurrence episode had occurred. The primary outcomes were recurrent toxoplasmic retinochoroiditis within the first year of follow-up and recurrent toxoplasmic retinochoroiditis within the third year of follow-up.

Results

The cumulative probability of recurrence at 1, 2, and 3 years of follow-up were, respectively, 13.0% (9/69), 17.4% (12/69), and 20.3% (14/69) in the placebo group and 0% (0/72) in the TMP-SMZ group (P < .001, log-rank test). There was no case of multiple recurrences in the same individual. No treatment-limiting toxicity or side effects were observed in either group. New recurrences were more frequent among female volunteers.

Conclusions

TMP-SMZ may be used safely for prophylaxis of recurrent toxoplasmic retinochoroiditis, with long-term benefits.

### Does trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis for HIV induce bacterial resistance to other antibiotic classes? Results of a systematic review [^116bLCRt]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

After placing weight on good-quality studies and additional weight on studies that were specifically designed to determine whether TMP-SMX prophylaxis increases antibiotic resistance, the findings of this review offer suggestive evidence that TMP-SMX prophylaxis for opportunistic infections in HIV protects against development of bacterial resistance to other classes of antibiotics. More carefully designed studies should be conducted to answer this question. It is important to ensure that future studies evaluate the importance of duration of exposure to TMP-SMX on antimicrobial resistance.

Ideally, microbial resistance surveys should be included with TMP-SMX implementation in developing countries to alert providers to any changes in drug resistance patterns.

Of most importance, the fear of antibiotic resistance should not stop health care providers from giving TMP-SMX to individuals who need it.

Treatment

Recommended Regimens for Scabies
Permethrin 5% cream applied to all areas of the body from the neck down and washed off after 8–14 hours
or
Ivermectin 200 ug/kg body weight orally, repeated in 14 days*
or
Ivermectin 1% lotion applied to all areas of the body from the neck down and washed off after 8–14 hours; repeat treatment in 1 week if symptoms persist
* Oral ivermectin has limited ovicidal activity; a second dose is required for eradication.
Alternative Regimen
Lindane 1% 1 oz of lotion or 30 g of cream applied in a thin layer to all areas of the body from the neck down and thoroughly washed off after 8 hours*
* Infants and children aged < 10 years should not be treated with lindane.

Topical permethrin and oral and topical ivermectin have similar efficacy for cure of scabies. Choice of treatment might be based on patient preference for topical versus oral therapy, drug interactions with ivermectin (e.g. azithromycin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole [Bactrim], or cetirizine [Zytrec]), and cost. Permethrin is safe and effective with a single application. Ivermectin has limited ovicidal activity and might not prevent recurrences of eggs at the time of treatment; therefore, a second dose of ivermectin should be administered 14 days after the first dose. Ivermectin should be taken with food because bioavailability is increased, thereby increasing penetration of the drug into the epidermis. Adjustments to ivermectin dosing are not required for patients with renal impairment; however, the safety of multiple doses among patients with severe liver disease is unknown.

Lindane is an alternative regimen because it can cause toxicity; it should be used only if the patient cannot tolerate the recommended therapies or if these therapies have failed. Lindane is not recommended for pregnant and breastfeeding women, children aged < 10 years, and persons with extensive dermatitis. Seizures have occurred when lindane was applied after a bath or used by patients who had extensive dermatitis. Aplastic anemia after lindane use also has been reported. Lindane resistance has been reported in some areas of the world, including parts of the United States.

RESULTS

Between August 2011 and June 2018, we enrolled 667 patients; 9 patients were found to be ineligible (Figure 1). Of 658 patients who had TMP-SMX as oral eradication treatment for 12 weeks and had no clinical evidence of active melioidosis, 322 (49%) were randomly assigned to stop the treatment (12-week regimen) and 336 (51%) were randomized to continue the treatment for another 8 weeks (20-week regimen). Baseline characteristics were comparable between the 2 groups (Table 1). There were no missing data for baseline characteristics. Overall, 30 patients (5%) did not require parenteral antimicrobial treatment, and 366 (56%) were deemed to require longer than 14 days of parenteral therapy before starting oral treatment. Most patients had a bodyweight of 40–60 kg and received 240/1200 mg of TMP/SMX twice daily. During their first 12 weeks of oral eradication treatment prior to enrollment, 615 (93%) patients received TMP-SMX alone, while 43 (7%) patients received TMP-SMX plus doxycycline.

Hospital pharmacist engagement is key to improve product quality and reconstitution.

Good collaboration between the clinical and pharmacy staff is essential to improve safety and dosing accuracy. Standardized tools such as the visual quality checklist used in this study can inform product selection upon procurement, for example, to select oral suspensions with clear instructions for reconstitution and with a dosing device included. Moreover, procurement of pediatric dose vials (low dose/small volume) and packaging including single-use sterile water for reconstitution can prevent multidose use, and flexible instead of rigid containers can bypass the need for air-venting. Correct reconstitution of oral suspensions can be most appropriately organized by the hospital pharmacy — that is, performed in a room that is separated from patient care with a correctly measured volume of safe (e.g. freshly boiled) water stored in a safe container. – Reconstitution at the hospital pharmacy also allows direct detection of reconstitution problems and thus facilitate pharmacovigilance, optimization of product selection for procurement, and reporting of problems to the supplier and to the national regulatory authority. The pharmacy staff should also provide guidance on correct storage and on splitting and crushing of tablets, when oral suspensions are not available or affordable.

To improve pharmacovigilance and to boost detection and reporting of substandard formulations, the hospital pharmacist could consider applying the visual checklist also to the products that must be purchased by the caretakers outside the hospital, for hospitalized children. This would seem a useful approach, considering that the private and informal sector in DR Congo are surely not exempted from the risk of substandard or falsified products. However, it is unlikely that there would be sufficient time for this additional activity in a routine setting.

### Severe and protracted hypoglycaemia associated with co-trimoxazole use [^1127YguW]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2006). Medium credibility.

Co-trimoxazole (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) is a commonly prescribed antimicrobial agent. Although it is well tolerated in most patients, serious adverse events related to its use have been described. Hypoglycaemia is a rare but potentially life-threatening complication of therapy. We describe a case of refractory hypoglycaemia complicated by seizure associated with co-trimoxazole for the treatment of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia in a patient with AIDS. We also review 13 previously reported cases of co-trimoxazole-induced hypoglycaemia. Among this patient population, renal insufficiency was the most prevalent predisposing risk factor (93%). The mean daily dose of co-trimoxazole was 4.5 double strength (160 mg trimethoprim/800 mg sulfamethoxazole) tablets per day. Serum insulin levels were raised or inappropriately normal in 88% of cases in which they were measured, suggesting a sulfonylurea-like effect of co-trimoxazole as the mechanism of hypoglycaemia. All cases required intravenous glucose administration, and 43% experienced protracted (> 12 hours) hypoglycaemia. Dosage adjustments should be made when prescribing co-trimoxazole to patients with renal dysfunction.

Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ) is the most effective Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) prophylactic agent, but adverse reactions are common among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients and limit its use. This randomized, double-blind controlled trial compared 2 methods of TMP-SMZ reintroduction, 6-day dose escalation and direct rechallenge, for PCP prophylaxis in HIV-infected patients who had experienced previous treatment-limiting reactions. The primary end point was the ability to take single-strength TMP-SMZ daily for 6 months. Seventy-five percent of the dose-escalation group and 57% of the direct-rechallenge group continued to receive daily single-strength TMP-SMZ for 6 months (P = 0.014). Among premature discontinuations, 58% of the dose-escalation group and 70% of the direct-rechallenge group were due to adverse reactions. None of these reactions was serious. This study provides evidence that it is possible to successfully reintroduce TMP-SMZ to a significant proportion of HIV-infected patients who have experienced mild-to-moderate treatment-limiting adverse reactions.

Toxoplasmosis — primary prophylaxis regimens and alternatives: In HIV-infected adolescents and adults, the double-strength-tablet daily dose of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) recommended as the preferred regimen for PCP prophylaxis is effective TE prophylaxis (AII), and data support this as the preferred regimen in children using age-based dosing (BIII). TMP-SMX, one double-strength tablet 3 times weekly (or 3 consecutive days a week), is an alternative (BIII); if patients cannot tolerate TMP-SMX, the recommended alternative is dapsone-pyrimethamine (BI*), and atovaquone with or without pyrimethamine also can be considered (CIII). Single-drug prophylaxis with dapsone, pyrimethamine, azithromycin, or clarithromycin cannot be recommended (AIII), aerosolized pentamidine does not protect against TE and is not recommended, and severely immunosuppressed children not receiving TMP-SMX or atovaquone who are seropositive should be given prophylaxis for both PCP and toxoplasmosis (i.e., dapsone plus pyrimethamine) (BIII).

After enrolment, we followed patients up at weeks 4, 12, and 20 of oral treatment, every 4 months for 1 year after completion of treatment, and annually thereafter to the end of the study. Patients who did not attend scheduled appointments were contacted by telephone. The trial was designed to stop 1 year after the last participant was enrolled. At each clinical visit, we undertook a clinical examination and laboratory analyses, including complete blood count, blood sugar, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, electrolyte, and liver function tests. Chest radiography and abdominal ultrasonography were done at enrolment, and repeated at weeks 12 and 20 if an abnormality was detected on the first test. We asked patients to bring the study drug bottles to follow-up visits, at which drug compliance was checked by pill counts. Treatment with the randomised drugs was extended beyond 20 weeks if clinically indicated because of evidence of residual infection, as decided by the treating physician. Concealed study drug bottles labelled with unique spare sequential code numbers were separately prepared for patients who needed treatment for more than 20 weeks. As needed, the site investigator contacted the coordinating centre by telephone to receive the code number of the extended study drug bottles for a specific study participant.

Study treatment was stopped immediately if a patient developed symptoms or signs of a severe allergic reaction (grade 4), and treatment was completed with the second-line regimen (amoxicillin-clavulanic acid). Patients who were not able to tolerate the study drugs because of other adverse drug reactions and those who had an inadequate response to the study drugs as judged by the treating physician were also switched to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid was prescribed according to a weight-based dosage, as follows: bodyweight less than 60 kg: 1000 mg amoxicillin and 250 mg clavulanic acid three times daily, and bodyweight greater than 60 kg: 1500 mg amoxicillin and 375 mg clavulanic acid three times daily.

Question 2. How safe is the paediatric ACT formulation compared to the non‐paediatric ACT formulation?

Comparison 1. Paediatric ACT dispersible tablet versus non‐paediatric ACT crushed tablet

Serious adverse events and drug‐related serious adverse events

The rate of serious adverse events was < 2% in the intervention and control arms of both studies. There were no drug‐related serious adverse events in either study.

Dispersible ACT and crushed tablet ACT were equally safe, with no difference in the rate of serious adverse events (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.38 to 2.88; 1197 participants, 2 studies; Analysis 1.9).

Comparison 2. Paediatric ACT suspension versus non‐paediatric ACT crushed tablet

Serious adverse events and drug‐related serious adverse events

The rate of serious adverse events was 2% in the intervention arm and 3% in the control arm; no serious adverse event was drug‐related.

Suspension ACT and crushed tablet ACT were equally safe, with no difference in the rate of serious adverse events (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.17 to 3.26; 267 participants, 1 study; Analysis 2.5).

Question 3. How is tolerability of the paediatric ACT formulation compared to the non‐paediatric ACT formulation?

Crushing film-coated tablets for administration — dispersible tablets are now considered the preferred formulation for pediatric patients weighing < 20 kg, and film-coated tablets should not be used in children weighing < 14 kg. In children weighing > 14 kg who have difficulty swallowing whole tablets, when the preferred dispersible tablets are not available, the 50-mg tablets may be split into halves with immediate ingestion of both halves or crushed and added to a small amount of semisolid food or liquid, all of which must be consumed immediately. In healthy adults, crushed tablets resulted in slightly higher exposures than whole tablets, and no information exists on the impact of splitting or crushing film-coated tablets on palatability. Some case reports describe DTG-containing film-coated tablets being crushed and successfully administered via orogastric tube or nasogastric tube; if DTG is administered via enteral tube, care should be taken to disperse the tablets completely and flush the tube to avoid clogging.

We used a central computer generated random number list to randomise patients to treatment with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or vancomycin. Allocation was concealed in sealed, opaque numbered envelopes that were opened consecutively after informed consent was obtained. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was started intravenously at a dose of 320 mg trimethoprim/1600 mg sulfamethoxazole twice daily and could be switched to oral treatment using the same dose at the discretion of the treating physician. Dosing was based on a pharmacokinetic study showing that a lower dose resulted in inhibition but not killing of S aureus and on the dose used in a previous trial. The vancomycin starting dose was 1 g twice daily. In both arms, treatment was adjusted to renal function; in the vancomycin arm, it was directed by serum concentrations to obtain drug trough concentrations between 10 and 20 mg/dL. The complete study protocol is available on request. Treatment had to be administered for a minimum of seven days, following which the duration depended on the indication. Concomitant antibiotics, other than the combination of vancomycin and co-trimoxazole, could be administered. After randomisation, no blinding was performed, but outcomes were adjudicated blinded to allocation.

### Does trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis for HIV induce bacterial resistance to other antibiotic classes? Results of a systematic review [^112BFkK7]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) has been shown to reduce HIV-related mortality among adults and children when used as prophylaxis against opportunistic infections. Since 2000, the World Health Organization (WHO) and Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS have recommended TMP-SMX prophylaxis for immunosuppressed adults and children born to HIV-infected women.

The successful roll-out of antiretroviral drugs has reduced the importance of TMP-SMX prophylaxis in developed countries. However, in resource-limited settings where antiretroviral therapy coverage is still incomplete and where confirmation of HIV infection in children < 18 months of age is limited, TMP-SMX prophylaxis remains vital for improving HIV management outcomes.

Despite widespread recommendations and availability of convincing evidence of the effectiveness of TMP-SMX, the implementation of its use has been poor. The WHO estimated that, in 2006, only 1% of the 4 million children eligible for TMP-SMX received it. In Zimbabwe in 2007, only 10.5% of children eligible for TMP-SMX received it.

In Africa, barriers to implementation include shortages of trained staff, stock-outs of TMP-SMX, and failure of health care systems to identify individuals eligible for TMP-SMX prophylaxis. In addition, there is anxiety that it may not be cost-effective. However new evidence of the intervention's cost-effectiveness may alleviate these concerns.

Furthermore, there has been a concern that this intervention will not work in areas where resistance to TMP-SMX is thought to be high. Fortunately, there is now convincing evidence from South Africa and Zambia that it is effective even in these settings, and indeed the beneficial effects persist even as resistance to TMP-SMX increases.

Of great importance has been the fear that blanket TMP-SMX prophylaxis may lead to an increase in resistance to other drugs besides TMP-SMX among common microbial pathogens. There is evidence that TMP-SMX prophylaxis does not increase resistance of Plasmodium falciparum to pyrimethamime-sulfadoxine. However, it remains unclear whether TMP-SMX prophylaxis increases bacterial resistance to other classes of antibiotics. Biologically, when TMP-SMX causes multidrug resistance, this is thought to be a result of coselection and transference of antibiotic resistance genes between bacteria. Conversely and indirectly, TMP-SMX prophylaxis may reduce development of multidrug resistance by preventing infections and, thereby, hospitalizations and exposure to other antibiotics.

Summary

Background

Melioidosis, an infectious disease caused by the Gram-negative bacillus Burkholderia pseudomallei, is difficult to cure. Antimicrobial treatment comprises intravenous drugs for at least 10 days, followed by oral drugs for at least 12 weeks. The standard oral regimen based on trial evidence is trimethoprim-sulfamethoxaxole (TMP-SMX) plus doxycycline. This regimen is used in Thailand but is associated with side-effects and poor adherence by patients, and TMP-SMX alone is recommended in Australia. We compared the efficacy and side-effects of TMP-SMX with TMP-SMX plus doxycycline for the oral phase of melioidosis treatment.

Methods

For this multi-centre, double-blind, non-inferiority, randomised placebo-controlled trial, we enrolled patients (aged ≥ 15 years) from five centres in northeast Thailand with culture-confirmed melioidosis who had received a course of parenteral antimicrobial drugs. Using a computer-generated sequence, we randomly assigned patients to receive TMP-SMX plus placebo or TMP-SMX plus doxycycline for 20 weeks (1:1; block size of ten, stratified by study site). We followed patients up every 4 months for 1 year and annually thereafter to the end of the study. The primary endpoint was culture-confirmed recurrent melioidosis, and the non-inferiority margin was a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.7. This study is registered with, number.

Findings

We enrolled and randomly assigned 626 patients: 311 to TMP-SMX plus placebo and 315 to TMP-SMX plus doxycycline. 16 patients (5%) in the TMP-SMX plus placebo group and 21 patients (7%) in the TMP-SMX plus doxycycline group developed culture-confirmed recurrent melioidosis (HR 0.81; 95% CI 0.42–1.55). The criterion for non-inferiority was met (p = 0.01). Adverse drug reactions were less common in the TMP-SMX plus placebo group than in the TMP-SMX plus doxycycline group (122 [39%] vs 167 [53%]).

Interpretation

Our findings suggest that TMP-SMX is not inferior to TMP-SMX plus doxycycline for the oral phase of melioidosis treatment, and is preferable on the basis of safety and tolerance by patients.

TE — preventing recurrence and chronic maintenance therapy specifies that patients who have completed initial therapy for TE should be given chronic maintenance therapy to suppress infection (AI) until immune reconstitution occurs as a consequence of ART, when treatment discontinuation is indicated. The combination of pyrimethamine plus sulfadiazine plus leucovorin is highly effective as suppressive therapy (AI) and provides protection against PCP (AII). For patients who cannot tolerate sulfa drugs, pyrimethamine plus clindamycin is commonly used (BI); because of high failure rates with lower doses, a dose of 600 mg clindamycin every 8 hours is recommended (CIII), and because this regimen does not provide protection against PCP (AII), an additional agent must be used. Atovaquone with or without pyrimethamine or sulfadiazine is also active against both TE and PCP (BII). A small, uncontrolled study in patients receiving ART for a median of 13 months suggested that TMP-SMX could be used as a suppressive regimen to reduce pill burden, and for patients being treated with TMP-SMX it should be continued as chronic maintenance at 1 double-strength tablet twice daily (BII) or once daily (BII). If once-daily dosing is used, a gradual transition may be beneficial, for example to follow acute therapy with 4–6 weeks of 1 double-strength tablet twice daily.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Isosporiasis in HIV-infected children — initial therapy and alternatives: On the basis of adult studies, the recommended treatment for children with HIV is trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), 5 mg/kg per dose of the trimethoprim component, given twice daily for 10 days. Intravenous TMP-SMX should be considered for potential or documented malabsorption. Daily pyrimethamine 50–75 mg in adults with folinic acid 10–25 mg/day may be an effective therapy and is the traditional alternative for patients who are intolerant of TMP-SMX. Other potential agents to consider for TMP-SMX-intolerant patients include ciprofloxacin or nitazoxanide, although ciprofloxacin is less effective than TMP-SMX. Supportive care, including replenishment of fluids and electrolytes, is essential.

HIV Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) primary prophylaxis — indications and regimens: Chemoprophylaxis against PCP should be given to adults and adolescents with HIV (including during pregnancy) with CD4 counts < 100 cells/mm3 regardless of plasma HIV levels (AIII) and those with CD4 counts between 100 and 200 cells/mm3 with plasma HIV RNA levels above detection limits (AI). Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) is the recommended prophylactic agent for PCP (AI), with one double-strength TMP-SMX tablet daily or one single-strength tablet daily as the preferred regimens (AI), and one double-strength TMP-SMX tablet three times weekly also effective (BI). Patients receiving pyrimethamine-sulfadiazine for treatment or suppression of toxoplasmosis do not require additional prophylaxis for PCP (AII), and TMP-SMX confers cross-protection against toxoplasmosis and many respiratory bacterial infections.

Entecavir was chosen based on the results of a prospective study, which demonstrated a higher incidence of reactivation (23%) in patients receiving rituximab who were HBsAg negative, anti-HBc positive and anti-HBs negative compared with patients who had almost the same serology profile but were anti-HBs positive. Since our patient fit the profile of the higher risk demographic, the decision was made to go forth with HBV prophylaxis. Of note, entecavir was chosen over Viread/Vemlidy (tenofovir disoproxil fumarate) because of the patient's low Cr clearance. Given the patient's Cr clearance of 11, the entecavir was renally dosed at 0.5 mg given orally every 3 days. Finally, our patient was also started on renally dosed oral Bactrim (trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole) tablet 160–800mg taken three times a week for prophylaxis against Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia.

Exposure to prophylactic‐

In this study, physicians at each institution determined the selection process of patients for prophylactic TMP‐SMX. In addition, because there were no established guidelines for discontinuing TMP‐SMX, the decision about when or whether to discontinue was also made at the physician's discretion. The TMP/SMX dosage was either one single‐strength tablet (TMP 80 mg and SMX 400 mg) daily or one double‐strength tablet (TMP 160 mg and SMX 800 mg) every other day, adjusted according to the patient's renal function. No patients received alternative prophylactic agents, such as dapsone or aerosolized pentamidine.

In this study, the index date (day 0) was defined as 14 days after the initiation of RTX or CYC as induction therapy. This 14‐day lead‐in period was established to ensure a stable study population and sufficient time for evaluating the prophylactic efficacy of TMP‐SMX. Patients who developed serious infection or censored during the lead‐in period were excluded. Exposure to TMP‐SMX was determined using two approaches (Supplementary Figure 2). First, an intention‐to‐treat (ITT) design was used in which each patient was classified into the prophylaxis group if he/she received the prophylactic TMP‐SMX at the index date. In the ITT analysis, classified patients remained in their original group regardless of later treatment changes. Second, a time‐varying analysis (ie, as‐treated) was performed in which each person‐day observation was classified according to whether the patient received prophylactic TMP‐SMX. In this approach, patients were able to dynamically transit between exposed and unexposed categories without restriction, defining consecutive periods of exposure or nonexposure as episodes. In both analyses, observation for all patients started on the index date and continued until either death, loss to follow‐up (defined as no visit for more than 6 months since the last visit), or 52 weeks from the index date, whichever occurred first.

Results

Between Oct 24, 2005, and Feb 1, 2010, we randomly assigned 626 patients with culture-confirmed melioidosis to receive either oral TMP-SMX plus placebo (n = 311), or oral TMP-SMX plus doxycycline (n = 315; figure 1). Baseline characteristics were comparable between the two treatment groups (table 1). There were no missing data for baseline characteristics. Overall, 40 patients (6%) did not require parenteral antimicrobial treatment before enrolment, and 357 patients (57%) were deemed to need longer than 14 days of parenteral treatment before starting oral treatment. Most patients had a bodyweight between 40 kg and 60 kg and received 320 mg of TMP with 1600 mg of SMX twice daily (table 1).

Baseline characteristics

Follow-up was completed in Feb 21, 2011, 1 year after we enrolled the last patient. 618 patients (99%) had at least one follow-up assessment. Median follow-up duration was 17 months (IQR 13–28) in the TMP-SMX plus placebo group and 19 months (16–31) in the TMP-SMX plus doxycycline group (p = 0.06). Total duration of follow-up was 536 person-years in the TMP-SMX plus placebo group and 583 person-years in the TMP-SMX plus doxycycline group.

We recorded no between-group difference in our primary analysis for culture-confirmed recurrent melioidosis (p = 0.64; table 2). Non-inferiority of TMP-SMX plus placebo was shown because the upper bound of the 95% CI was below the pre-defined non-inferiority margin (one-sided p = 0.01; figure 2). The probability of having culture-confirmed recurrent melioidosis within 1 year of enrolment was 3% and within 3 years of enrolment was 10% (figure 3). Of 37 culture-confirmed recurrent melioidosis cases, seven (19%) occurred during 20 weeks of oral treatment, 17 (46%) occurred during the first year of follow-up, four (11%) occurred between year 1 and year 2 of follow-up, and nine (24%) occurred after 2 years.

14.2 Treatment of PCP

The indication for treatment of mild-to-moderate PCP is based on the results of 2 efficacy trials: a randomized, double-blind trial comparing atovaquone tablets with TMP-SMX in subjects with HIV/AIDS and mild-to-moderate PCP (defined in the protocol as [(A-a)DO2] ≤ 45 mm Hg and PaO2 ≥ 60 mm Hg on room air) and a randomized open-label trial comparing atovaquone tablets with IV pentamidine isethionate in subjects with mild-to-moderate PCP who could not tolerate trimethoprim or sulfa antimicrobials. Both trials were

conducted with the tablet formulation using 750 mg three times daily. Results from these efficacy trials established a relationship between plasma atovaquone concentration and successful outcome. Successful outcome was defined as improvement in clinical and respiratory measures persisting at least 4 weeks after cessation of therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

Several dosing schemes have been used successfully: given 3 days per week on consecutive days or on alternate days, given 2 days per week on consecutive days or on alternate days, or given every day (total daily dose of TMP 5–10 mg/kg body weight given as a single dose each day).

### Does trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis for HIV induce bacterial resistance to other antibiotic classes? Results of a systematic review [^116gcvqq]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) prophylaxis has long been recommended for immunosuppressed HIV-infected adults and children born to HIV-infected women. Despite this, many resource-limited countries have not implemented this recommendation, partly because of fear of widespread antimicrobial resistance not only to TMP-SMX, but also to other antibiotics. We aimed to determine whether TMP-SMX prophylaxis in HIV-infected and/or exposed individuals increases bacterial resistance to antibiotics other than TMP-SMX.

Methods

A literature search was conducted in Medline, Global Health, Embase, Web of Science, ELDIS, and ID21.

Results

A total of 501 studies were identified, and 17 met the inclusion criteria. Only 8 studies were of high quality, of which only 2 had been specifically designed to answer this question. Studies were classified as (1) studies in which all participants were infected and/or colonized and in which rates of bacterial resistance were compared between those taking or not taking TMP-SMX and (2) studies comparing those who had a resistant infection with those who were not infected. Type 1 studies showed weak evidence that TMP-SMX protects against resistance. Type 2 studies provided more convincing evidence that TMP-SMX protects against infection.

Conclusion

There was some evidence that TMP-SMX prophylaxis protects against resistance to other antibiotics. However, more carefully designed studies are needed to answer the question conclusively.

### Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in pediatric HIV infection [^114LhQw2]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

ABC/DTG/3TC dispersible tablets — preparation and administration — tablets should be fully dispersed in the appropriate volume of drinking water in the supplied cup and the suspension should be swirled so that no lumps remain. After full dispersion and within 30 minutes of mixing, administer the oral suspension, then rinse the dosing cup with a small amount of water and give this additional water to the child to ensure the child takes the full dose and no medication remains in the dosing cup. ABC/DTG/3TC dispersible tablets should not be swallowed whole, chewed, or crushed.

### Atovaquone (atovaquone oral suspension) [^114vuHhc]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Other reactions occurring in ≥ 10% of subjects receiving the recommended dose of atovaquone oral suspension (1,500 mg once daily) included vomiting, sweating, flu syndrome, sinusitis, pruritus, insomnia, depression, and myalgia.

PCP Treatment Trials

Safety information is presented from 2 clinical efficacy trials of the atovaquone tablet formulation: 1) a randomized, double-blind trial comparing atovaquone tablets with TMP-SMX in subjects with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and mild-to-moderate PCP [(A-a)DO2] ≤ 45 mm Hg and PaO2 ≥ 60 mm Hg on room air; 2) a randomized, open-label trial comparing atovaquone tablets with intravenous (IV) pentamidine isethionate in subjects with mild-to-moderate PCP who could not tolerate trimethoprim or sulfa antimicrobials.

TMP-SMX Comparative Trial: In the TMP-SMX comparative trial (n = 408), the majority of subjects were white (66%) and male (95%); the mean age was 36 years. Subjects received atovaquone 750 mg (three 250-mg tablets) 3 times daily for 21 days or TMP 320 mg plus SMX 1,600 mg 3 times daily for 21 days; median durations of exposure were 21 and 15 days, respectively.
