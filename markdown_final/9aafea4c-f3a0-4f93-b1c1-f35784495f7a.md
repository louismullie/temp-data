## Question

How can esophageal dysphagia be distinguished from oropharyngeal dysphagia?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to distinguish esophageal dysphagia from oropharyngeal dysphagia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how history localizes the problem by timing and perceived location. Then, I should consider food consistency patterns to infer structural versus motility etiologies. Next, I will review associated symptoms and red flags. After that, I need to examine which physical exam elements truly add value. Then, I will select initial tests based on suspected localization and outline complementary testing for equivocal cases. Finally, I will integrate findings, watch for overlap syndromes, and define escalation pathways for alarm features.

> Let me first confirm the key historical discriminator of timing and location. Difficulty initiating a swallow with immediate symptoms in the mouth or throat, coughing, choking, or nasal regurgitation points toward oropharyngeal dysphagia, whereas a sensation of food "sticking" seconds after a successful swallow with retrosternal localization suggests esophageal dysphagia, although perceived location can be misleading and should not anchor the evaluation too early [^113LqLSq].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about pathophysiology before I check consistency patterns. Solids-only dysphagia that later progresses to include liquids strongly suggests an esophageal structural process, while dysphagia to solids and liquids from onset raises concern for an esophageal motility disorder such as achalasia, whereas oropharyngeal dysphagia typically impairs bolus formation and initiation and often affects both consistencies early; I almost said solids-only could signal motility, but wait, that pattern more reliably indicates fixed obstruction rather than propulsion failure [^116qiid3].

> I will now examine associated symptoms and red flags to refine localization and urgency. Wet or gurgly voice after swallowing, recurrent aspiration or pneumonia, and concomitant neurologic signs favor oropharyngeal causes, while heartburn or regurgitation, food impaction, progressive weight loss, odynophagia, and noncardiac chest pain point to esophageal disease and should lower the threshold for urgent endoscopy to exclude malignancy or severe inflammation [^113LqLSq] [^114dCSRZ] [^115yiHSc].

> Next, I should review what the physical exam can and cannot tell me. A targeted cranial nerve exam with attention to tongue strength, palatal elevation, laryngeal function, and broader neurologic screening adds meaningful information for suspected oropharyngeal dysphagia, whereas the exam is often unrevealing for isolated esophageal disease; I need to ensure I do not overinterpret a normal exam when history is compelling for esophageal pathology [^113w18D7].

> Let me verify the first-line tests based on suspected localization. If oropharyngeal dysphagia is suspected, FEES and VFSS are complementary, with FEES showing higher sensitivity for aspiration and pharyngeal residue, and VFSS providing dynamic oral and pharyngeal phase imaging; test selection should be individualized by availability and clinical question, acknowledging operator dependence and the need for objective metrics where possible [^115ZPxmF] [^113E5Qu8] [^11165WLq].

> If esophageal dysphagia is suspected, I should confirm that upper endoscopy with biopsies is preferred first-line to identify and treat mucosal or structural disease and to diagnose eosinophilic esophagitis, while a barium esophagram is appropriate when endoscopy is unavailable, contraindicated, or when subtle rings, webs, or postoperative anatomy require delineation; I should double-check that biopsy sampling is pursued even with a normal-appearing esophagus when EoE is on the table [^113LqLSq] [^114dCSRZ] [^112McHs8].

> Wait, let me verify the role of manometry and timed barium in equivocal cases or suspected motility disorders. After structural disease is excluded, high-resolution manometry is the gold standard to diagnose achalasia and other motility disorders, with adjunctive timed barium esophagram to quantify esophageal emptying and support diagnosis or track treatment response when manometric results are borderline [^111mQvQ5] [^112DbcVP] [^114jrk6Q].

> Hold on, I should also confirm crossover testing strategies to avoid missed lesions. If oropharyngeal studies are negative but symptoms persist, proceed to EGD to evaluate the esophagus, and conversely, if endoscopy is unrevealing in a patient with initiation difficulties or aspiration symptoms, obtain FEES or VFSS to identify overlooked oropharyngeal dysfunction and aspiration risk [^117EBUvH] [^113E5Qu8] [^114dCSRZ].

> Let me think about overlap and special contexts so I do not oversimplify. Neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's can affect both oropharyngeal and esophageal phases, and connective tissue disease can similarly blur boundaries, so multidisciplinary input from gastroenterology, otolaryngology, and speech-language pathology is often necessary to integrate history, imaging, and manometry into a coherent diagnosis and plan [^112KUEK4] [^115FpQA9] [^1153PJYZ].

> I need to ensure escalation for alarm features and avoid anchoring bias. Progressive dysphagia with weight loss, iron-deficiency anemia, or odynophagia warrants expedited endoscopic evaluation for malignancy, and throat-localized obstructive symptoms can originate from distal esophageal disease, so I should reconsider localization if initial studies are discordant with the clinical picture [^114dCSRZ] [^113LqLSq] [^115yiHSc].

> Finally, to synthesize: start with careful history emphasizing timing and consistency, add a focused cranial nerve and oral exam if oropharyngeal disease is suspected, choose FEES or VFSS for pharyngeal phase assessment and EGD or barium esophagram for esophageal evaluation, progress to high-resolution manometry and timed barium when structural disease is excluded but motility is suspected, and integrate data across modalities while maintaining vigilance for overlap syndromes and red flags that necessitate urgent intervention [^1153PJYZ] [^113E5Qu8] [^111mQvQ5].

### Accuracy of endoscopic and videofluoroscopic evaluations of swallowing for oropharyngeal dysphagia [^115ZPxmF]. The Laryngoscope (2017). Low credibility.

A systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature was conducted to compare the accuracy with which flexible endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES) and videofluoroscopic swallowing study (VFSS) assessed oropharyngeal dysphagia in adults.

Data sources included PubMed, Embase, and the Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS) database.

A review of published studies was conducted in parallel by two groups of researchers. We evaluated the methodological quality, homogeneity, threshold effect, and publication bias. The results are presented as originally published, then with each test compared against the other as a reference and both compared against a composite reference standard, and then pooled using a random effects model. Software used consisted of Meta-DiSc and SPSS.

The search yielded 5,697 articles. Fifty-two articles were reviewed in full text, and six articles were included in the meta-analysis. FEES showed greater sensitivity than VFSS for aspiration (0.88 vs. 0.77; p = 0.03), penetration (0.97 vs. 0.83; p = 0.0002), and laryngopharyngeal residues (0.97 vs. 0.80; P < .0001). Sensitivity to detect pharyngeal premature spillage was similar for both tests (VFSS: 0.80; FEES: 0.69; p = 0.28). The specificities of both tests were similar (range, 0.93–0.98). In the sensitivity analysis, there were statistically significant differences between the tests regarding residues but only marginally significant differences regarding aspiration and penetration.

In conclusion, FEES had a slight advantage over VFSS to detect aspiration.

- **Pathophysiology**: Esophageal dysphagia is caused by structural or inflammatory abnormalities (strictures, rings, webs, malignancy, reflux esophagitis, eosinophilic esophagitis) and motility disorders (achalasia, ineffective esophageal motility, esophageal spasm, esophagogastric junction outflow obstruction).

- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations of esophageal dysphagia include difficulty swallowing solids and liquids, intermittent or progressive dysphagia, food bolus impaction, food regurgitation, heartburn, weight loss, anorexia, respiratory distress, hypotension, and atypical chest pain.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Annual mortality associated with GERD is 0.46 per 100,000 individuals.

### Dysphagia: Evaluation and collaborative management [^113LqLSq]. American Family Physician (2021). Low credibility.

Dysphagia is common but may be underreported. Specific symptoms, rather than their perceived location, should guide the initial evaluation and imaging. Obstructive symptoms that seem to originate in the throat or neck may actually be caused by distal esophageal lesions. Oropharyngeal dysphagia manifests as difficulty initiating swallowing, coughing, choking, or aspiration, and it is most commonly caused by chronic neurologic conditions such as stroke, Parkinson's disease, or dementia. Symptoms should be thoroughly evaluated because of the risk of aspiration. Patients with esophageal dysphagia may report a sensation of food getting stuck after swallowing. This condition is most commonly caused by gastroesophageal reflux disease and functional esophageal disorders. Eosinophilic esophagitis is triggered by food allergens and is increasingly prevalent; esophageal biopsies should be performed to make the diagnosis. Esophageal motility disorders such as achalasia are relatively rare and may be overdiagnosed. Opioid-induced esophageal dysfunction is becoming more common. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy is recommended for the initial evaluation of esophageal dysphagia, with barium esophagography as an adjunct. Esophageal cancer and other serious conditions have a low prevalence, and testing in low-risk patients may be deferred while a four-week trial of acid-suppressing therapy is undertaken. Many frail older adults with progressive neurologic disease have significant but unrecognized dysphagia, which significantly increases their risk of aspiration pneumonia and malnourishment.

### The dysphagia stress test for rapid assessment of swallowing difficulties in esophageal conditions [^115XqLpL]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2019). Low credibility.

Esophageal dysphagia is a common symptom in gastroenterology practice. Rapid assessment tools are generally limited to oropharyngeal dysphagia and do not translate well to esophageal conditions. We aim to create a novel tool, the dysphagia stress test (DST), to evaluate swallowing in patients with esophageal disease characterized by dysphagia.

- **Methods**: Adults with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), achalasia, and dysphagia not otherwise specified (NOS) participated. Patient controls with non-esophageal diagnoses and healthy controls were also recruited. Participants completed the DST with five bolus challenges: water, applesauce, rice, bread, and a barium tablet, and they rated their swallowing difficulty and pain. A study clinician observed and documented water use and the refusal of any challenges. Participants also completed measures of esophageal symptoms, hypersensitivity, and symptom anxiety to evaluate the DST's validity. Collinearity of bolus challenges guided item reduction.

- **Key Results**: A total of 132 subjects participated. Both control groups and GERD patients exhibited the best swallowing ability, while achalasia, EoE, and dysphagia NOS scored poorer. About 90% of patients were able to attempt or pass each of the bolus challenges, suggesting high acceptability. Construct validity of the DST is evidenced by modest negative correlations with symptom severity, hypersensitivity, and anxiety. The DST does not appear to be influenced by brain-gut processes. Applesauce, rice, and bread demonstrated collinearity; thus, the DST was reduced accordingly.

### Effect of thickened fluids on swallowing function in oropharyngeal dysphagia: Impact of shear rheology and disorder subtype [^116nBbqh]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2025). Low credibility.

The formulation of thickened drinks is an essential therapeutic strategy for many patients presenting with dysphagia symptoms. Fluid thickeners reduce airway penetration-aspiration, an effect shown to be viscosity-dependent. Thickened fluids, however, require optimization on a case-by-case basis, as improvements in safety may be counteracted by reduced palatability.

Fluid rheology influences how swallowed boluses behave during transit through the pharyngo-esophageal segment during deglutition. The different components of the swallow motor response impose different shear forces on the bolus. A thickened fluid bolus, when subjected to these shear forces, exhibits non-Newtonian shear-thinning flow behavior; thus, viscosity decreases during the swallowing process. The magnitude of these effects can be estimated through laboratory rheological testing at different shear rates, such as 50 s⁻¹ and 300 s⁻¹, representing the forces being notionally applied to the bolus domain during the oral and hypopharyngeal phases of bolus transport.

### Can the repetitive saliva swallow test predict airway invasion in all cause dysphagia [^113QUopf]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Low credibility.

Oropharyngeal dysphagia (OD) is a prevalent condition affecting up to 50% of individuals in rehabilitation centers and nursing homes. Despite its high prevalence, OD is often underdiagnosed and underreported. Early detection is crucial due to troublesome symptoms and severe complications associated with this condition. Notably, Hinchey et al. demonstrated that formal screening for OD can significantly reduce the incidence of pneumonia.

- **Instrumental assessment**: The gold standard for the diagnosis of OD involves instrumental assessment, such as video fluoroscopy (VFS) and fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES). Instrumental swallowing assessments focus on evaluating and quantifying the safety of the swallow (i.e. airway invasion) and the efficiency of the swallow (i.e. pharyngeal residue).

- **Penetration–aspiration scale (PAS)**: The PAS is an ordinal scale with eight distinct levels that score airway invasion during instrumental swallowing evaluations. Its score ranges from no penetration of material into the airway (PAS = 1) to material passing through the vocal cords with no attempt to eject it (PAS = 8). Typically, in the literature, scores are categorized between PAS 1 and 2 versus PAS 3 and 8. A PAS score of 3 indicates the invasion of material into the airway without ejection.

While instrumental testing provides reliable diagnoses for OD, it is relatively expensive and requires a high level of expertise to execute and interpret.

### Subjective assessment of videofluoroscopic swallow studies [^11165WLq]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

The videofluoroscopic swallow study (VFSS) is the gold standard diagnostic tool to evaluate oropharyngeal dysphagia. Although objective measurements on VFSS have been described, there is no universal method of analysis, and the majority of clinicians rely solely on subjective interpretation. This investigation aimed to evaluate the accuracy of subjective VFSS analysis through a double-blinded experiment conducted in a tertiary care laryngology center.

Seventy-six de-identified videos from VFSS evaluations of patients with dysphagia were presented individually to blinded, experienced speech-language pathologists and laryngologists. Evaluators rated each video as normal or abnormal concerning hyoid elevation (HE), pharyngeal area (PA), pharyngeal constriction ratio (PCR), and pharyngoesophageal segment opening (PESo). A blinded investigator assessed the evaluators' inter- and intrarater agreement and compared their responses to objectively measured results to examine accuracy.

Evaluators correctly classified only 61.5% of VFSS videos as normal or abnormal, with moderate interrater agreement (κ = 0.48, P < .0001). Intrarater agreement was highly variable (κ = 0.43–0.83). Accuracy was greatest for PCR (71.6%), with poorer performance for HE (61.3%), PESo (59.2%), and PA (45.3%). Interrater agreement was moderate for all parameters, with greater concordance for PCR (κ = 0.59) and PESo (κ = 0.54) and less for HE (κ = 0.40) and PA (κ = 0.44). Evaluators unanimously agreed on a correct interpretation of a VFSS only 28% of the time.

### How to effectively use and interpret the barium swallow: Current role in esophageal dysphagia [^111qABDy]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2023). Low credibility.

The barium swallow is a commonly performed investigation, though recent decades have seen major advances in other esophageal diagnostic modalities.

- **Purpose**: The purpose of this review is to clarify the rationale for components of the barium swallow protocol, provide guidance on interpretation of findings, and describe the role of the barium swallow in the diagnostic paradigm for esophageal dysphagia in relation to other esophageal investigations. The barium swallow protocol, interpretation, and reporting terminology are subjective and non-standardized. Common reporting terminology and an approach to their interpretation are provided.

- **Assessment and comparison**: A timed barium swallow (TBS) protocol provides more standardized assessment of esophageal emptying but does not evaluate peristalsis. The barium swallow may have higher sensitivity than endoscopy for detecting subtle strictures. Although the barium swallow has lower overall accuracy than high-resolution manometry for diagnosing achalasia, it can help secure the diagnosis in cases of equivocal manometry. TBS has an established role in the objective assessment of therapeutic response in achalasia and helps identify the cause of symptom relapse.

- **Specific uses**: The barium swallow plays a role in evaluating manometric esophagogastric junction outflow obstruction, sometimes helping to identify where it represents an achalasia-like syndrome. It should be performed in dysphagia following bariatric or anti-reflux surgery to assess for both structural and functional post-surgical abnormalities. The barium swallow remains a useful investigation in esophageal dysphagia diagnostics.

### The incidence of oropharyngeal dysphagia in infants with GERD-like symptoms [^1179NJKJ]. JPEN. Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2013). Low credibility.

Symptoms of infantile gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) may overlap with oropharyngeal dysphagia, but the evaluation and treatment of these conditions vary greatly. In this investigation, the incidence of oropharyngeal dysphagia in infants with GERD-like symptoms is determined.

- **Materials and methods**: A retrospective chart review was performed on infants referred to a pediatric gastroenterology clinic for GERD-like symptoms. A feeding screen was performed in all infants. Standardized bedside swallow evaluation and modified barium swallow (MBS) studies were then performed when clinically indicated. A similarly aged cohort of normal participants also underwent a standard bedside swallow evaluation for group comparison.

- **Results**: The study population included 67 infants. A swallow evaluation was recommended in 39 of 67 infants, with abnormalities noted in all. Swallowing abnormalities were more frequent and clustered in infants with GERD-like symptoms compared to controls. MBS was abnormal in 16 of 17 qualifying infants. Characteristics of at-risk infants included extreme prematurity, developmental delay, or symptoms refractory to antireflux medications.

- **Conclusion**: Oropharyngeal dysphagia is prominent in infants with GERD-like symptoms.

### Pharyngo-esophageal modulatory swallow responses to bolus volume and viscosity across time [^113Cw7zC]. The Laryngoscope (2022). Low credibility.

Oropharyngeal swallowing is a highly complex process requiring adequate neuro-regulation and modulation to safely transfer the bolus from the mouth to the esophagus. Afferent sensory information from the mouth and oropharynx is important for the accommodation of the swallow motor response to a specific bolus. Bolus properties like volume, viscosity, taste, and temperature serve as peripheral sensory input to the brainstem. This information is integrated with input from cortical areas and may influence the central pattern generator neurons within the brainstem, resulting in a motor output of the swallow response adjusted for sensory feedback.

The effect of modification of bolus textures and volumes is commonly used in dysphagia management and is an established compensatory technique. Thickened liquids increase the safety of swallowing by reducing the prevalence of penetration and aspiration, although the prevalence of post-swallow residue may increase. Additionally, it has been shown that sensory-stimulating liquids (i.e. sour, cold, and carbonated liquids, and capsaicinoids) induce biomechanical changes of the swallow and increase swallow safety in patients with dysphagia. Sensory stimulation may therefore also be of importance as a dysphagia intervention.

Some studies show that patients with oropharyngeal dysphagia or aspiration have an altered response to changes in bolus volume and viscosity. For instance, a decreased pharyngeal delay with increasing bolus volumes was found in stroke patients, with most of them having mild swallow abnormalities, but not in healthy individuals.

### Effect of a gum-based thickener on the safety of swallowing in patients with poststroke oropharyngeal dysphagia [^1132hE1L]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2019). Low credibility.

Oropharyngeal dysphagia (OD) is a motility disorder characterized by difficulty forming or moving the alimentary bolus from the mouth to the esophagus and can include aspiration. Poststroke OD (PSOD) is classified in the ICD under the code: 438.82 (ICD‐9) and I69.391 (ICD‐10). OD is a prevalent complaint following a stroke, with a high incidence (45%) on hospital admission. It is associated with a poor short‐ and long‐term prognosis and several complications, such as malnutrition, dehydration, and aspiration pneumonia, which increase the risk of mortality in comparison with poststroke patients without OD. It is an independent risk factor for prolonged hospital stay and institutionalization after discharge, and it correlates with poorer functional capacity and increased mortality three months following a stroke. While some patients recover spontaneously, 50% assessed six months poststroke were found to have chronic OD.

The pathophysiology of PSOD is characterized by several motor impairments in the kinematics of the swallow response, including delayed laryngeal vestibule closure (LVC) and decreased bolus propulsion forces. Additionally, patients affected by unilateral stroke showed a disrupted pattern of sensory cortical activation after pharyngeal stimulation as a distinctive marker of abnormal sensory integration of swallowing pathways in PSOD.

Thickening agents increase the viscosity of fluids and thin liquids, enhancing the safety of swallowing by avoiding aspirations and their associated complications, as stated in a review by the European Society for Swallowing Disorders.

### Diagnosis and management of pediatric dysphagia: A review [^114YaS5T]. JAMA Otolaryngology–Head & Neck Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Awareness of swallowing dysfunction in the pediatric population is growing. As many as 50% of parents report that their otherwise healthy children have a feeding problem. Dysphagia is increasingly common in the pediatric population, especially as advances in health care improve the survival of extremely premature infants and children with complex congenital anomalies. Symptoms of dysphagia and aspiration prompt referral to otolaryngologists.

- **Observations**: Dysfunction can exist at any of the four phases of the physiologic swallow. Dysphagia manifests differently in children at each age in their development. It can present in otherwise healthy children but is more common in patients with a history of prematurity, neuromuscular disorders, cardiopulmonary disorders, anatomic anomalies of the upper aerodigestive tract, and gastrointestinal tract disorders. Workup involves clinical feeding evaluations, imaging studies, and endoscopic evaluations. Appropriate management depends on the cause of dysphagia.

- **Conclusions and relevance**: The causes of dysphagia in children are varied and often multifactorial. Evaluation by a multidisciplinary team can facilitate accurate diagnosis and guide management.

### The American Broncho-Esophagological Association position statement on swallowing fluoroscopy [^113E5Qu8]. The Laryngoscope (2023). High credibility.

To develop an expert consensus statement on the clinical use of swallowing fluoroscopy in adults, the objective is to reduce practice variation and identify opportunities for quality improvement in the care of patients suffering from swallowing impairment. A search strategist reviewed data sources, including PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, Web of Science, and Scopus, to gather evidence for an expert development group to compose statements, focusing on areas of controversy regarding swallowing fluoroscopy. Candidate statements underwent two iterations of a modified Delphi protocol to reach consensus.

A total of 2,184 publications were identified for title and abstract review, with 211 publications meeting the criteria for full-text review. Of these, 148 articles were included for further review. Additionally, 116 publications were included after reviewing the references of the full-text publications from the initial search. These 264 references guided the authors to develop 41 candidate statements in various categories. Forty statements, encompassing patient selection, fluoroscopic study choice, radiation safety, clinical team dynamics, training requirements, videofluoroscopic swallow study and esophagram techniques, and interpretation of swallowing fluoroscopy, met the criteria for consensus. One statement on esophagram technique reached near-consensus.

These 40 statements pertaining to the comprehensive use of swallowing fluoroscopy in adults can guide the development of best practices, improve the quality and safety of care, and influence policy in both the outpatient and inpatient settings.

### Diagnostic approach to patients with suspected motility disorders: one size does not fit all [^111rmcwL]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

- **Summary box**:

- **What is already known**: Dysphagia and retrosternal chest pain are considered typical manifestations of major esophageal motility disorders. Although in many patients with non-typical symptoms, motility disorders are suspected as the origin of their symptoms. High-resolution manometry (HRM) is the gold standard for the diagnosis of motility disorders. There are insufficient data regarding the findings of endoscopy and barium studies in patients with non-typical esophageal symptoms referred for HRM.

- **What the new findings are**: In the absence of typical symptoms, a lack of compatible endoscopic and timed-barium swallow findings almost completely rules out a diagnosis of major esophageal motility disorders (mEMD). More than half of the patients referred for HRM will be diagnosed with mEMD, and the rate will be higher when typical symptoms are reported. Achalasia, especially type II achalasia, is the most commonly diagnosed major motility disorder, even among patients with non-typical esophageal symptoms.

### The relationship between upper esophageal sphincter manometry function and esophageal motility disorders [^111BkxXF]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). Low credibility.

For a bolus to pass from the pharynx into the esophagus, the upper esophageal sphincter (UES) must open. This opening requires coordinated relaxation, among other events, during the transition from the oropharyngeal to esophageal phases of deglutition. This study demonstrates that higher lower esophageal sphincter (LES) pressure is correlated with increased UES relaxation time and relaxation duration, suggesting that aberrant LES pressure is closely related to prolonged UES relaxation and, thus, an altered ability to open the UES. This suggested relationship is supported by the finding that among patients with disorders of the LES, like achalasia, many have impaired UES relaxation as well.

Altered UES relaxation may be clinically significant given that UES relaxation permits UES opening, which allows for a bolus to enter the esophagus. It follows that impaired UES relaxation can impair hypopharyngeal and oropharyngeal bolus clearance by diminishing the ability of the UES to open, leading to failed swallows. As mentioned, the directionality of the relationship between LES and UES dysfunction is unclear. However, it is possible that UES dysfunction occurs as a response to LES pathology, as evidenced by studies that found that treatment of LES pathology results in improved UES function. As it pertains to the results of this study, UES relaxation (or opening) may be prolonged in individuals with LES dysfunction as a product of maladaptive response to an already dysfunctional esophagus. Ultimately, further studies are needed to determine how the function of the LES impacts the function of the UES, and vice versa.

### Dysphagia profiles among inpatients with dementia referred for swallow evaluation [^114V41Bf]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2022). Low credibility.

Oropharyngeal dysphagia, or swallowing dysfunction, is a condition that affects more than 16 million individuals in the United States and results in serious health consequences, including pneumonia, malnutrition, and death. Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) commonly lead to oropharyngeal dysphagia. In fact, pneumonia due to dysphagia-related aspiration is the most commonly cited complication leading to death in older individuals with ADRD. Hospitalized patients with ADRD are particularly vulnerable to developing comorbid dysphagia as a result of their diagnosis. One study observed that patients with comorbid ADRD and dysphagia are at increased risk for malnutrition, aspiration pneumonia, mechanical ventilation, and increased length of hospital stay compared to those without dysphagia.

Despite the serious consequences of dysphagia, prevalence estimates for its occurrence in individuals with ADRD range widely across studies from 7 to 87%. These differences are due to variations in the method of dysphagia measurement, such as patient-reported outcome measures (PROs), screening tools, bedside clinical evaluations, and instrumental assessments. The definition of dysphagia, dementia subtype (e.g. Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia), stage of dementia progression, and study setting (home, hospital, institution) also contribute to these variations. Despite the serious consequences of dysphagia in hospitalized patients, these variations in prevalence estimates limit the understanding of dysphagia and development of optimal treatment for patients with ADRD compared to other populations.

### Effect of thickened fluids on swallowing function in oropharyngeal dysphagia: Impact of shear rheology and disorder subtype [^116tmGWg]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2025). High credibility.

In conclusion, measures derived from P‐HRM‐I swallowing assessments align with bolus rheology at shear rates relevant to the pharyngeal phase and are modified by swallowing dysfunctions that impair normal pharyngo-esophageal bolus transport. We believe these observations to be clinically relevant. Understanding rheology-based effects on swallowing parameters in appropriately subtyped patients may help to guide the development of therapeutic interventions for dysphagia management. This study opens the door to undertake further investigations to establish whether P‐HRM‐I assessment may have a complementary role in optimizing fluid thickener interventions.

### Esophageal motility disorders: Current approach to diagnostics and therapeutics [^113BuZFS]. Gastroenterology (2022). Low credibility.

Dysphagia is a common symptom with a significant impact on quality of life. Our diagnostic armamentarium was primarily limited to endoscopy and barium esophagram until the advent of manometric techniques in the 1970s, which provided the first reliable tool for assessing esophageal motor function. Significant advances have been made over the last three decades in understanding various esophageal motility disorders due to improvements in diagnostics with high-resolution esophageal manometry. High-resolution esophageal manometry has improved the sensitivity for detecting achalasia and enhanced our understanding of spastic and hypomotility disorders of the esophageal body. This review discusses the approach to the diagnosis and therapeutics of various esophageal motility disorders.

### Pharyngeal and upper esophageal sphincter manometry in the evaluation of dysphagia [^115RF55X]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

Use of esophageal manometry seems to be increasing, but the utility of pharyngeal and upper esophageal sphincter (UES) manometry is not widely recognized. This article is intended to clarify this subject. Initially, we review the anatomy and physiology of this area. Most studies indicate that the manometry of the UES and pharynx provides useful information primarily in patients who have symptoms of oropharyngeal dysfunction. Oropharyngeal dysphagia has high morbidity, mortality, and cost. It occurs in one-third of all stroke patients and is common in the chronic care setting; up to 60% of nursing home occupants have feeding difficulties, a substantial portion of whom have dysphagia.

For patients with oropharyngeal dysphagia, as for those with esophageal dysphagia, a barium swallow study and manometry are complementary. Their combined use permits us to enhance the understanding of the pathophysiological process that causes the patient's symptoms. Abnormalities have been noted in a variety of diseases, such as Parkinson's disease, oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy, achalasia, and scleroderma. Thus, it is possible to determine the primary pathology causing the patient's dysphagia by analyzing the manometry results. Pharyngeal and UES manometry also has value in evaluating patients who are candidates for myotomy or dilatation, as it can help identify patients with a prospective good outcome.

Esophageal dysphagia can be associated with various conditions, including:

- **Autoimmune and inflammatory conditions**: scleroderma, eosinophilic esophagitis

- **Symptoms and physical manifestations**: cough, dysphagia, hoarseness, weight loss, regurgitation of undigested food, heartburn, drooling

### Approach to the patient with dysphagia [^114VKEvY]. The American Journal of Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Dysphagia is a fascinating symptom. It is ostensibly simple when defined by trouble swallowing, yet its subtleties in deciphering and variations in pathophysiology almost mandate a thorough knowledge of medicine itself. With patience and careful questioning, a multitude of various disorders may be suggested before an objective test is performed. Indeed, the ability to diligently and comprehensively explore the symptom of dysphagia is not only rewarding but also a real test for a physician who prides themselves on good history taking.

### Esophageal visualization as an adjunct to the videofluoroscopic study of swallowing [^112RvPht]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Complaints of dysphagia for solids lead to speech-language pathology (SLP) referral. Yet many of these patients are later diagnosed with esophageal rather than oropharyngeal dysphagia. Fluoroscopic screening involving the oropharynx alone fails to identify these patients. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of esophageal abnormalities in an SLP-led videofluoroscopic study of swallowing (VFSS) clinic.

- **Study design**: Prospective, observational study.

- **Setting**: Radiology suite, public hospital.

- **Subjects and methods**: In total, 111 consecutive mixed-etiology patients referred to the clinic by otorhinolaryngology (ORL) (59) or by a speech-language pathologist (52) were recruited. A VFSS was performed according to protocol, and at completion, esophageal visualization (in anterior-posterior plane) was performed by administration of a large liquid barium bolus and a barium capsule. All VFSS recordings were analyzed using objective digital measures of timing and displacement.

- **Results**: Sixty-eight percent of patients had an abnormal esophageal transit. One-third of those referred presented exclusively with esophageal abnormalities, while one-third had both oropharyngeal and esophageal abnormalities. Oral abnormalities, reduced pharyngoesophageal segment maximum opening (PESmax), and increasing age were significantly associated with esophageal abnormalities.

- **Conclusion**: Fluoroscopic evaluation of the pharynx alone, without esophageal review, risks incomplete diagnosis of patients with esophageal disorders. Using esophageal visualization allows timely recognition and comprehensive assessment of swallowing disorders.

### Relationship between esophageal contraction patterns and clearance of swallowed liquid and solid boluses in healthy controls and patients with dysphagia [^116PoHPx]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2012). Low credibility.

Non-obstructive dysphagia patients prove to be a difficult category for clinical management. Esophageal high-resolution manometry (HRM) is a novel method used to analyze dysphagia. However, it is not yet clear how findings on HRM relate to bolus transport through the esophagus.

- **Methods**: Twenty healthy volunteers and 20 patients with dysphagia underwent HRM and videofluoroscopy in a supine position. Each subject swallowed five liquid and five solid barium boluses. Esophageal contraction parameters and bolus transport were evaluated with HRM and videofluoroscopy.

- **Key results**: Stasis of liquid and solid barium boluses occurred in patients and healthy volunteers in 64% and 41%, and 84% and 82% of the swallows, respectively. Overall, 70% of the liquid and 72% of the solid bolus swallows were followed by a peristaltic contraction, the difference not being statistically significant. Statistically significant associations were found for transition zone length of liquid and solid boluses and for DCI and distal contraction amplitudes for liquid stasis. No correlation was found between the degree of stasis and other manometric parameters.

- **Conclusions and inferences**: Stasis of both liquid and solid boluses occurs frequently in patients and controls and can be regarded as physiological. Motility patterns can predict the effectiveness of bolus transit and level of stasis to some degree. However, the relationship between esophageal motility and transit is complex and far from perfect. Esophageal manometry is therefore currently deemed unfit to be used for the p

### High-resolution manometry improves the diagnosis of esophageal motility disorders in patients with dysphagia: A randomized multicenter study [^115ovKH6]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

High-resolution manometry (HRM) might be superior to conventional manometry (CM) in diagnosing esophageal motility disorders. We aimed to compare the diagnosis performed with HRM and CM, confirmed at 6 months in a multicenter randomized trial.

- **Methods**: Patients with unexplained dysphagia were randomized to undergo either CM or HRM. Motility disorders were diagnosed using the Castell and Spechler classification for CM and the Chicago classification for HRM. Diagnosis confirmation was based on clinical outcomes and response to treatment following a 6-month follow-up. The initial diagnosis and percentage of confirmed diagnoses were compared between the two arms (CM and HRM).

- **Results**: In total, 247 patients were randomized and 245 analyzed: 122 in the CM arm and 123 in the HRM arm. A manometric diagnosis was more frequently initially achieved with HRM than with CM (97% vs. 84%; P < 0.01). Achalasia was more frequent in the HRM arm (26% vs. 12% in the CM arm; P < 0.01), while normal examinations were more frequent in the CM arm (52% vs. 28% in the HRM arm; P < 0.05). After follow-up, the initial diagnosis was confirmed in 89% of patients in the HRM arm vs. 81% in the CM arm (P = 0.07). Finally, overall procedure tolerance was better with CM than with HRM (P < 0.01).

- **Conclusions**: This randomized trial demonstrated an improved diagnostic yield for achalasia with HRM compared with CM. Diagnoses tended to be more frequently confirmed in patients who underwent HRM, suggesting that esophageal motility disorders could be identified earlier with HRM than with CM.

### Diagnostic evaluation of dysphagia [^1153PJYZ]. Nature Clinical Practice: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2008). Low credibility.

Taking a careful history is vital for the evaluation of dysphagia. The history will yield the likely underlying pathophysiologic process and the anatomic site of the problem in most patients, and it is crucial for determining whether subsequently detected radiographic or endoscopic 'anomalies' are relevant or incidental. Although the symptoms of pharyngeal dysphagia can be multiple and varied, the typical features of neurogenic pharyngeal dysphagia are highly specific and can accurately distinguish pharyngeal from esophageal disorders. The history will also dictate whether the next diagnostic procedure should be endoscopy, a barium swallow, or esophageal manometry. In some difficult cases, all three diagnostic techniques may need to be performed to establish an accurate diagnosis. Stroke is the most common cause of pharyngeal dysphagia. A videoradiographic swallow study is vital in such cases to determine the extent and timing of aspiration and the severity and mechanics of dysfunction as a prelude to therapy.

### Management of gastrointestinal symptoms in Parkinson's disease: A comprehensive review of clinical presentation, workup, and treatment [^112KUEK4]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2024). Low credibility.

- **Esophageal dysphagia**: Dysphagia is among the most common GI symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD). Studies of dysphagia prevalence in this population have largely focused on oropharyngeal dysphagia, the management of which has been thoroughly reviewed elsewhere. The etiology of esophageal dysphagia is not yet well-understood but has long been thought to involve defective coordination of the esophageal musculature due to the involvement of the dorsal nuclear vagus of the brainstem. However, like other GI symptoms, dysphagia has been known to occur before motor manifestations of PD, and patients with PD demonstrate marked histopathologic abnormalities of the esophageal enteric nervous system (ENS).

	- Postmortem studies of patients with PD have revealed increased Lewy bodies in the mid- and especially distal esophagus at the level of the myenteric plexus. However, the correlation of esophageal Lewy pathology with dysphagia symptom severity or with esophageal manometric pattern has not been established. Regardless, esophageal dysphagia remains an important entity to address, both in terms of the nutritional and symptomatic needs of patients, and to reduce the risk of aspiration pneumonia, a common cause of death in PD. Dysphagia is also associated with an increased risk of malnutrition among patients with PD, and accounts for about 50% of referrals for percutaneous gastrostomy tube placements in this population. In addition, dysphagia is associated with higher levels of depression and lower quality of life.

	- **Esophageal motility disorders**: According to the Chicago classification criteria, these disorders are present in about one-third of patients with PD.

### Sensitivity and specificity of the eating assessment tool and the volume-viscosity swallow test for clinical evaluation of oropharyngeal dysphagia [^1162H4Qb]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2014). Low credibility.

Oropharyngeal dysphagia (OD) is a gastrointestinal motility disorder that involves difficulty or inability to safely move the alimentary bolus from the mouth to the esophagus, potentially including tracheobronchial aspirations. OD is highly prevalent, affecting 37–78% of patients following a stroke and 23–47.5% of different elderly phenotypes. It is explicitly classified as a digestive condition by the World Health Organization in the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-9 and ICD-10). OD is a major contributor to malnutrition, a prevalent condition among hospitalized patients, which leads to extended hospital stays, prolonged rehabilitation, and diminished quality of life. OD can also result in respiratory infections and aspiration pneumonia, with associated mortality rates of up to 50%. Despite its high prevalence and severe complications, OD is often not systematically explored and detected, leaving most patients undiagnosed and untreated.

### Oesophageal dysphagia: A stepwise approach to diagnosis and management [^115yiHSc]. The Lancet Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

Dysphagia is a common symptom in the general population, with incidence varying depending on the specific definition used. A thorough medical history is crucial for distinguishing true oesophageal dysphagia from oropharyngeal dysphagia or other causes. Oesophageal dysphagia is considered a red flag alarm symptom that necessitates oesophagogastroduodenoscopy. However, even after investigations such as oesophagogastroduodenoscopy (with biopsy), barium swallow, and oesophageal manometry, no obstructive cause may be identified. This review suggests an algorithm involving history-taking and investigation to identify the causes of non-obstructive dysphagia, including functional dysphagia. It subsequently discusses management strategies and outcomes for functional dysphagia.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines for oesophageal manometry and oesophageal reflux monitoring [^112McHs8]. Gut (2019).

- **Summary of all recommendations**:

	- **Oesophageal manometry, including high resolution manometry**

		1.1 In patients undergoing evaluation for dysphagia, high resolution manometry (HRM) is superior to standard manometry in terms of reproducibility, speed of performance, and ease of interpretation. GRADE evidence: High. Strength recommendation: Strong.

		1.2 The addition of impedance to HRM can be a helpful adjunct to 'visualise' bolus movement and peristalsis effectiveness; however, its utility in clinical practice and impact on therapeutic decision-making is not yet clear. GRADE evidence: Moderate. Strength recommendation: Conditional/weak.

		1.3 Normal values for HRM are manufacturer and catheter specific. GRADE evidence: High. Strength recommendation: Strong.

		1.4 Adjunctive testing (e.g. larger volumes of water, solid/viscous swallows or a test meal) can provide additional information and unmask pathology not seen with standard water swallows, as they are more representative of normal swallowing behaviour and more likely to induce symptoms, thereby improving diagnostic yield. GRADE evidence: High. Strength recommendation: Strong.

	- **Patients with dysphagia**

		1.5 Patients with dysphagia should preferably have an endoscopy with oesophageal biopsies to rule out and treat mucosal and structural disorders prior to manometry. Barium swallow should be considered where endoscopy is not possible and/or where structural disorders require further scrutiny. GRADE evidence: Moderate. Strength recommendation: Strong.

- **Patients with achalasia**

### Do children with dysphagia and normal esophageal motility according to Chicago classification always have "normal" esophageal motility [^116uPknU]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2025). Low credibility.

Internationally adopted Chicago Classification (CC) criteria, based on adult normative data, have been used to diagnose children with esophageal motility disorders undergoing high-resolution esophageal manometry (HREM). The aim of this study was to compare HREM parameters of children without dysphagia and children with dysphagia and normal findings according to CC.

- **Methods**: HREM metrics of 41 children (13.2 years, range 9–18; 20 female) without dysphagia and 41 children (13.7 years, range 8–18; 30 female) with dysphagia and normal diagnosis according to CC were compared. Analyzed data included resting and integrated relaxation pressures (IRP) of the upper (UES) and lower (LES) esophageal sphincters, esophageal peristaltic contractile integrals, transition zone (TZ) gaps, distal latency (DL), and manometric esophageal length to height ratio (MELH). The 95th percentile normative cutoffs were calculated from the cohort without dysphagia.

- **Key results**: Proximal contractile integral (PCI), UES, and LES mean resting and IRP were not significantly different between the cohorts (p > 0.3). On the contrary, distal contractile integral (DCI), TZ gap, and MELH were notably different, with p-values of 0.0002, 0.027, and 0.033, respectively. According to the 95th percentile normative cutoffs of DCI, TZ gap, and MELH, in the cohort with dysphagia, 27%, 15%, and 22% of patients, respectively, were not normal.

- **Conclusion & inferences**: This is the first study to compare HREM parameters of children without dysphagia to those with dysphagia. A considerable proportion of children with dysphagia may be underdiagnosed according to the adult criteria.

### Screening of dysphagia in geriatrics [^114qA2gh]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Low credibility.

The accumulation of food can be interpreted through the findings of Turley and Cohen, who stated that oropharyngeal dysphagia in older people is related to impaired swallow efficacy and/or safety due to weak tongue propulsion and a prolonged and delayed oropharyngeal swallow response (OSR). Impaired swallow efficacy is associated with reduced bolus propulsion caused by weak muscular tongue force related to sarcopenia, leading to the accumulation of different consistencies in the oral cavity and an increased risk of aspiration pneumonia.

Voice changes in aging individuals can be attributed to the structural and physiological changes that occur during old age across all systems, including those responsible for voice production, namely the respiratory and vocal tract systems. Voice changes were noted in the context of the bedside evaluation, particularly after oral intake of food and fluids. In this context, voice changes serve as a symptom of laryngeal penetration and thus represent a major symptom of severe dysphagia.

The changes due to calcification and ossification of cartilages, muscle and vocal fold atrophy, vocal fold bowing, reduced mucosal wave, and alterations in pulmonary lung pressures, volumes, and elasticity have an impact on voice production and quality.

To confirm the presence of dysphagic symptoms and signs in this study, the EAT-10, a valid self-perceived questionnaire, was administered to all subjects, while FEES was performed only for suspected cases. The results obtained from the EAT-10 revealed that 12.5% to 17.5% of the subjects studied had difficulty.

### Pediatric aerodigestive medicine: Advancing collaborative care for children with oropharyngeal dysphagia [^1174B7XB]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2023). Low credibility.

Aerodigestive disorders encompass various pathological conditions affecting the lungs, upper airway, and gastrointestinal tract in children. While advanced care has primarily occurred in specialty centers, many children first present to general pediatric gastroenterologists with aerodigestive symptoms necessitating awareness of these conditions. At the 2021 Annual North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition meeting, the aerodigestive special interest group held a full-day symposium entitled Pediatric Aerodigestive Medicine: Advancing Collaborative Care of Children with Aerodigestive Disorders. The symposium aimed to underline the significance of a multidisciplinary approach to achieve better outcomes for these complex patients.

- **Methods**: The symposium brought together leading experts to highlight the growing aerodigestive field, promote new scientific and therapeutic strategies, share the structure and benefits of a multidisciplinary approach in diagnosing common and rare aerodigestive disorders, and foster multidisciplinary discussion of complex cases while highlighting the range of therapeutic and diagnostic options. In this article, we showcase the diagnostic and therapeutic approach to oropharyngeal dysphagia (OPD), one of the most common aerodigestive conditions, emphasizing the role of a collaborative model.

- **Conclusions**: The aerodigestive field has made significant progress and continues to grow due to a unique multidisciplinary, collaborative model of care for these conditions.

### Brief resolved unexplained events symptoms frequently result in inappropriate gastrointestinal diagnoses and treatment [^113PpTTf]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

The objective of this study was to determine associations between presenting symptoms and oropharyngeal dysphagia diagnoses, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) diagnoses, and treatment with acid suppression medication in infants with brief resolved unexplained event (BRUE).

The study design involved a prospective cohort study of infants with BRUE to review presenting symptoms and their potential impact on testing and treatment. Videofluoroscopic swallow study (VFSS) results and explanatory diagnoses were obtained from medical record review, and acid suppression use was determined by parental survey. Binary and multivariable logistic regression models were used to evaluate associations between presenting symptoms and obtaining VFSS, VFSS results, GERD diagnoses, and acid suppression medication.

The results showed varied presenting symptoms in 157 subjects enrolled at 51.0 ± 5.3 days of age, with many symptoms potentially related to GERD or dysphagia. Of these, 28% underwent VFSS, with 71% having abnormal results. Overall, 42% had their BRUE attributed to GERD, and 33% were treated with acid suppression during follow-up. Presenting symptoms were significantly associated with the decision to obtain VFSS but not with abnormal VFSS results. Presenting symptoms were also associated with the provision of GERD explanatory diagnoses. Both presenting symptoms and GERD explanatory diagnoses were associated with acid suppression use (aOR 2.3, 95% CI 1.03–5.3, P = 0.04).

In conclusion, presenting symptoms may play a role in clinicians' decisions on which BRUE patients undergo VFSS, but they are unreliable for making a diagnosis of oropharyngeal dysphagia.

### Airway closure delay: The predominant pathophysiology in reflux-associated dysphagia [^111RTqc5]. Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

Reflux disease is common in patients with oropharyngeal dysphagia, but the impact of reflux on oropharyngeal swallowing physiology is not well understood. This study employs objective measures of swallowing function from modified barium swallow studies to describe the pathophysiology of dysphagia in a group of patients whose only associated condition is reflux.

- **Study design**: Retrospective chart review.
- **Setting**: Tertiary care voice and swallowing clinic.
- **Subjects and methods**: The Swallowing Database at the University of Utah was queried for patients with a diagnosis of reflux without additional conditions known to affect swallowing function. Pharyngeal transit time (TPT), distance of hyoid elevation (H max), maximum opening size of the upper esophageal sphincter (UES max), area of the pharynx at maximum constriction (PA max), airway closure timing relative to the arrival of the bolus at the UES, and penetration/aspiration (Pen/Asp) score were assessed.

- **Results**: Of the 122 patients who met inclusion criteria for the study, 42% had normal pharyngeal swallowing function, 57% had at least one abnormal swallowing measure, and 47.5% demonstrated a delay in airway closure relative to the arrival of the bolus at the UES on at least one swallow. The incidences of prolonged TPT, diminished H max, poor UES max, and enlarged PA max were 2.5%, 8%, 4%, and 11.5%, respectively. Sixty percent of those with a delay in airway closure had a normal Pen/Asp score.

- **Conclusion**: A delay in airway closure relative to the arrival of the bolus at the UES is the most common abnormality of swallowing function found.

### The anatomy and physiology of normal and abnormal swallowing in oropharyngeal dysphagia [^112CoX6h]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2017). Low credibility.

Eating and drinking are enjoyable activities that positively impact an individual's quality of life. The ability to swallow food and fluid is integral to the process of eating. Swallowing occupies a dual role, being both part of the enjoyment of eating and a critically important utilitarian activity to enable adequate nutrition and hydration. Any impairment to the process of swallowing can negatively affect a person's perception of their quality of life.

Swallowing is highly complex and involves muscles in the mouth, pharynx, larynx, and esophagus. The oropharynx is the anatomical region encompassing the oral cavity and the pharynx. Food must be masticated, formed into a bolus, and transported to the pharynx by the tongue, whereas fluids are usually held within the mouth before being transported ab-orally. The bolus must then be transported through the pharynx to the esophagus without any matter entering the larynx.

The muscles needed for all these steps are coordinated by swallowing centers within the brainstem, which are supplied with sensory information by afferent nerve fibers from several cranial nerves. The swallowing centers also receive modulatory input from higher centers within the brain. Hence, a swallow has both voluntary and involuntary physiologic components. The term dysphagia is given to difficult swallowing, while oropharyngeal dysphagia refers to difficult swallowing due to pathology within the oropharynx. Problems affecting any point along the complex swallowing pathway can result in dysphagia.

### Esophageal dysfunction in different stages of Parkinson's disease [^115FpQA9]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2017). Low credibility.

Dysphagia is a clinically relevant symptom in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), leading to a pronounced reduction in quality of life and other severe complications. Parkinson's disease-related dysphagia may affect the oral and pharyngeal phases, as well as the esophageal phase of swallowing.

- **Methods**: To examine the nature and extent of esophageal dysphagia in different stages of PD and their relation to oropharyngeal dysfunction, we examined 65 PD patients (mean age 66.3 ± 9.7 years, mean disease duration 7.9 ± 5.8 years, mean Hoehn & Yahr [H&Y] stage 2.89 ± 0.91). These patients were divided into three groups: early (H&Y I+II; n = 21), intermediate (H&Y III; n = 25), and advanced stages (H&Y IV+V; n = 19). We used esophageal high-resolution manometry (HRM) to detect esophageal motor disorders, while oropharyngeal impairment was assessed using fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing.

- **Key results**: Major esophageal motor disorders were detected in nearly one-third of the PD patients. Minor impairment of the esophageal body was present in 95% of participants across all disease stages, with pathological findings especially in peristalsis and intrabolus pressure (IBP). The IBP was found to significantly increase in the advanced stages. Although dysfunction of the upper and lower esophageal sphincters was observed in individual patients, alterations in these segments did not reveal statistical significance compared with normative data. No clear association was found between the occurrence of oropharyngeal dysphagia and esophageal impairment.

### Expert consensus statement: Management of dysphagia in head and neck cancer patients [^116GhMF3]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2023). High credibility.

The objective of the study was to develop an expert consensus statement (ECS) on the management of dysphagia in head and neck cancer (HNC) patients. This ECS aims to address controversies and offer opportunities for quality improvement. Dysphagia in HNC is defined as swallowing impairment in patients with cancers of the nasal cavity, paranasal sinuses, nasopharynx, oral cavity, oropharynx, larynx, or hypopharynx.

Development group members with expertise in dysphagia followed established guidelines for developing ECS. A professional search strategist systematically reviewed the literature, and the best available evidence was used to compose consensus statements targeted at providers managing dysphagia in adult HNC populations. The development group prioritized topics where there was significant practice variation and those that would improve the quality of HNC patient care if consensus were possible.

The development group identified 60 candidate consensus statements, based on 75 initial proposed topics and questions, focusing on the following high-yield topics: risk factors, screening, evaluation, prevention, interventions, and surveillance. After two iterations of the Delphi survey and the removal of duplicative statements, 48 statements met the standardized definition for consensus; 12 statements were designated as having no consensus.

Expert consensus was achieved for the 48 statements pertaining to risk factors, screening, evaluation, prevention, intervention, and surveillance for dysphagia in HNC patients. Clinicians can use these statements to enhance patient care and improve clinical outcomes.

### Pharyngeal dysphagia: What the radiologist needs to know [^115aA56H]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2008). High credibility.

Dysphagia is defined as difficulty in swallowing. Oropharyngeal dysphagia is defined as difficulty in moving the bolus from the mouth to the esophagus. The best initial evaluation of suspected oropharyngeal dysphagia is a barium study, which can evaluate motility of the oropharynx and hypopharynx and provide double-contrast views that may identify structural or mucosal abnormalities.

Pharyngeal diverticula, such as Zenker's and Killian-Jamieson diverticula, and pharyngeal pouches are readily identified on these studies. Zenker's diverticula are the most common diverticulum implicated in pharyngeal dysphagia and typically occur in the setting of cricopharyngeal dysfunction. The radiologist must not only diagnose these diverticula but also understand the normal postoperative appearance after diverticulotomy, which can often be confusing for the uninitiated imager.

Cervical webs are a common finding in pharyngeal dysphagia and should not be mistaken for a normal postcricoid defect. Other potentially challenging diagnostic issues include the correct identification of lingual hyperplasia, which mimics lymphoma, and the detection of squamous carcinoma, which is more mass-like but sometimes difficult to see among the complex anatomic lines of the pharynx. All of the above abnormalities are easily differentiated from the retention cyst, the most common "mass" in the pharynx. Pathology extrinsic to the pharynx, such as tumors and cervical osteophytes, can result in secondary symptoms from mass effect. This article discusses the various radiographic findings in normal and abnormal states of the pharynx.

### Can the repetitive saliva swallow test predict airway invasion in all cause dysphagia [^112rJDgc]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Low credibility.

However, no studies at the time of writing have specifically examined the RSST's diagnostic properties across an all‐cause dysphagia population, leaving a critical knowledge gap. This is important because, in clinical practice, the etiology of OD is often unclear at the time of screening. The pathophysiology, severity, and symptoms of OD can differ widely depending on the underlying cause, which may influence the performance of screening tools like the RSST. Therefore, evaluating the RSST in a broader population that includes a variety of dysphagia etiologies will provide valuable insights into its generalizability and utility across different patient groups.

When considering the utility of the RSST as a screening tool for OD, the normative values and how much they are affected by non‐dysphagia–related factors also need to be considered. In a previous study, we investigated the normal values of RSST in the healthy population across various age groups. The mean RSST score was 7. The study demonstrated an inverse relationship between age and RSST scores. Additionally, a lower RSST score was associated with higher BMI (body mass index), female gender, and a greater number of prescribed medications.

Our study aimed to determine the diagnostic properties of the RSST in predicting airway invasion in patients with all‐cause OD using FEES as a gold standard test. We hypothesized that the RSST would be a valid tool to predict airway invasion; however, it would be slightly less accurate in the all‐cause dysphagia population compared to the neurogenic dysphagia population.

### British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines for oesophageal manometry and oesophageal reflux monitoring [^117PtdyN]. Gut (2019). Low credibility.

Patients with dysphagia should preferably have an endoscopy with oesophageal biopsies to rule out and treat mucosal and structural disorders prior to manometry. Barium swallow should be considered where endoscopy is not possible and/or where structural disorders require further scrutiny.

- **GRADE evidence**: Moderate
- **Strength recommendation**: Strong

Oesophago-gastro-duodenoscopy (OGD) is the preferred investigation in patients with oesophageal dysphagia, as it allows direct visual inspection of the oesophagus and histological sampling. Fifty-four percent of a sample of 1649 patients presenting with dysphagia had a major abnormality at OGD, with a higher yield in men aged over 40 years who experienced heartburn, odynophagia, and weight loss in association with dysphagia. Patients with dysphagia should undergo OGD and biopsy at two levels in the oesophagus to exclude eosinophilic oesophagitis when no mucosal or structural cause for their symptoms is found.

Contrast radiology is a useful adjunct to endoscopic examination in diagnosing patients with dysphagia. In countries with limited healthcare resources or in situations where patients are unable or unwilling to undergo endoscopic examination, a contrast study can outline irregularities in the oesophageal lumen and diagnose the majority of stricturing lesions within the oesophagus.

### Clinical practice guidelines for the assessment of uninvestigated esophageal dysphagia [^115bCeDa]. Journal of the Canadian Association of Gastroenterology (2018). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for esophageal dysphagia — more specifically concerning the barium esophagram — CAG 2018 guidelines recommend considering a barium esophagram in some patients if local access to endoscopy is limited. This helps assess significant structural lesions and facilitates timely referral to urgent endoscopy and specialist consultation.

### Effects of effortful swallow on esophageal function in healthy adults [^116eDmQo]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2012). Low credibility.

Treatment for esophageal dysmotility is currently limited to primarily pharmacologic intervention, which has questionable utility and frequently associated negative side effects. A potential behavioral intervention for esophageal dysmotility is the effortful oropharyngeal swallow. A previous pilot study using water perfusion manometry found an increase in distal esophageal amplitudes during effortful vs. non-effortful swallowing. The study sought to duplicate the previous study with improvements in methodology.

- **Methods**: The effects of swallow condition (effortful vs. non-effortful), sensor site, and gender on esophageal amplitude, duration, velocity, and bolus clearance were examined for 18 adults (nine males and nine females, mean age = 29.9 years) via combined solid-state manometry and intraluminal impedance.

- **Key results**: The effortful swallow condition yielded significantly higher esophageal amplitudes across all sensor locations (P < 0.05). Further, effortful swallowing decreased the risk of incomplete bolus clearance compared with non-effortful swallowing (OR: 0.51; 95% CI: 0.30–0.86).

- **Conclusions & inferences**: With improved manometric instrumentation, larger participant numbers, and methodology that controlled for potential confounding factors, this study confirms and advances the results of the previous pilot study: Volitional manipulation of the oropharyngeal phase of swallowing using the effortful swallow indeed affects esophageal physiology. Thus, the effortful swallow offers a behavioral manipulation of the esophageal phase of swallowing.

### A multinational consensus on dysphagia in Parkinson's disease: Screening, diagnosis and prognostic value [^111tppaZ]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

Oro-pharyngo-esophageal scintigraphy (OPES) is a useful tool for the early detection of dysphagia, but its diagnostic role in Parkinson's disease (PD) remains to be ascertained as only a single study has been carried out in this patient population. Although only preliminary evidence is available, swallowing evaluation with high-resolution manometry (HRM) represents another interesting diagnostic tool, capable of showing subtle swallowing changes in the early stages of PD even in the absence of swallowing changes on videofluoroscopic swallow study (VFSS).

The electro-kinesiologic swallowing study (EKSS) represents an additional useful diagnostic tool to explore the pathophysiological mechanisms of oropharyngeal dysphagia and provide clues for treatment selection. For example, electromyography of the cricopharyngeal muscle (i.e. the main component of the upper esophageal sphincter, UES) helps to clarify whether failure in UES opening during the pharyngeal phase of swallowing is due to persistent sphincter hyperactivity or to reduced elevation of the pharyngeal-laryngeal structures. In the former case, botulinum toxin injection into the cricopharyngeal muscle may be beneficial. However, very few centers use UES electromyography routinely; thus, this examination cannot currently be considered as a standard test for dysphagia.

Gastroenterological investigations including esophageal manometry, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, acid- and reflux-related tests, and/or radiological investigations such as a barium swallow should always be carried out in the presence of esophageal symptoms (e.g. dysphagia for solid foods, regurgitation).

### Oropharyngeal dysphagia: Manifestations and diagnosis [^115g3c5M]. Nature Reviews Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2016). Low credibility.

Swallowing disorders (dysphagia) have been recognized by the WHO as a medical disability associated with increased morbidity, mortality, and costs of care. With increasing survival rates and an ageing population, swallowing disorders and their role in causing pulmonary and nutritional pathologies are becoming exceedingly important. Over the past two decades, the study of oropharyngeal dysphagia has been approached from various disciplines, leading to considerable progress in understanding its pathophysiology. This review describes the most frequent manifestations of oropharyngeal dysphagia and the clinical, as well as instrumental, techniques available to diagnose patients with dysphagia. However, the clinical value of these diagnostic tests and their sensitivity to predict outcomes is limited. Despite considerable clinical research efforts, conventional diagnostic methods for oropharyngeal dysphagia have limited proven accuracy in predicting aspiration and respiratory disease. We contend that the incorporation of measurable objective assessments into clinical diagnoses is needed and might be key in developing novel therapeutic strategies.

### Oropharyngeal dysphagia and nutritional management [^112XieM6]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

The purpose of this review is to highlight the management of oropharyngeal dysphagia, which has garnered increasing attention recently. Specialists from various disciplines are involved, and the results of developments in dysphagia management are published in an array of journals. This review focuses on recent advancements in the diagnosis and clinical management of dysphagia.

Recent findings include the development of new instruments for diagnosis. Clinical observations have been made that promise a better understanding of the various deficits involved in dysphagia. Deficiencies in both recognizing and managing dysphagia have been highlighted in recent reviews.

New techniques for quantifying the type and degree of dysphagia in patients are described. Prospective studies have emphasized that dysphagia often remains imperfectly diagnosed; some newer and less expensive techniques may enhance diagnosis. The benefits of using multidisciplinary teams for the effective management of dysphagia have been emphasized by numerous investigators. Quality of life issues in dysphagia are gaining wider recognition, and recommendations to improve patients' quality of life have been made, including enhancements in nutrition and the use of psychological counseling. Cochrane reviewers have identified shortcomings in the dysphagia knowledge base and have stressed the necessity for more properly controlled and randomized clinical trials.

### Eaaci food allergy and anaphylaxis guidelines: Diagnosis and management of food allergy [^113ZwPEH]. Allergy (2014). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for esophageal dysphagia, specifically in relation to esophageal biopsy, the EAACI 2014 guidelines recommend performing an esophageal biopsy with 2–4 samples taken from both the proximal and distal esophagus for the diagnosis of eosinophilic esophagitis. It is advised to perform the biopsy after administering double-dose PPI therapy for at least 6 weeks to rule out esophageal eosinophilia caused by GERD and to exclude PPI-responsive esophageal eosinophilia.

### Oesophageal dysphagia: manifestations and diagnosis [^113w9xGR]. Nature Reviews Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

Oesophageal dysphagia is a common symptom that might be related to severe oesophageal diseases such as carcinomas. Therefore, it is crucial to rule out an organic process through endoscopy in all patients presenting with dysphagia symptoms. The most prevalent obstructive aetiologies include oesophageal cancer, peptic strictures, and eosinophilic oesophagitis. Eosinophilic oesophagitis is a significant cause of dysphagia in both adults and children, justifying the necessity of obtaining oesophageal biopsy samples from all patients with unexplained dysphagia.

With the advent of standardized high-resolution manometry and specific metrics for characterizing oesophageal motility, the Chicago classification has become a gold-standard algorithm for the manometric diagnosis of oesophageal motor disorders. Additionally, sophisticated investigations and analysis methods that combine pressure and impedance measurements are currently in development. In the future, these techniques might be able to detect subtle pressure abnormalities during bolus transport, which could further elucidate pathophysiology and symptoms. The degree to which novel approaches will help distinguish dysphagia caused by motor abnormalities from functional dysphagia still needs to be determined.

### An oropharyngeal pH monitoring device to evaluate patients with chronic laryngitis [^117Ns17E]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2013). Low credibility.

Diagnostics for gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD) are suboptimal because of limited sensitivity. We performed in vitro and in vivo studies to systematically assess the performance characteristics of an oropharyngeal pH probe.

- **Methods**: In vitro studies compared the oropharyngeal probe with a standard pH catheter in liquid and aerosolized solutions, ranging from pH 1–7. The accuracy of measurements, deviation from target pH, and time to equilibrium pH were determined. Simultaneous distal esophageal pH measurements were obtained in 11 patients with GERD. Oropharyngeal and distal esophageal reflux parameters were measured for controls (n = 20), patients with GERD (n = 17), and patients with chronic laryngitis (n = 10).

- **Key results**: In the liquid phase, at pH 4–5, the oropharyngeal probe had less deviation from the target value than the standard catheter; deviation in the vapor phase was similar (0.4 pH units). Median (interquartile) time to reach equilibrium pH was significantly faster (P < 0.001) with the oropharyngeal than the standard probe. In comparing simultaneous distal esophageal pH characteristics, 96% of recordings with the new and standard probes were in agreement to within ± 1.0 pH unit; 71% of recordings were in agreement within ± 0.5 pH units. Patients with chronic laryngitis had significantly higher levels of oropharyngeal acid exposure at pH < 4, < 5, and < 6, in the upright position than patients with GERD or controls (P < 0.001).

- **Conclusions & inferences**: Oropharyngeal pH monitoring appears to be more sensitive than traditional pH monitoring in evaluation.
