## Question

What is the first diagnostic test to do for muscle weakness

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the first diagnostic test should be for muscle weakness and how to justify that choice with references. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming true weakness and differentiating it from fatigue or pain-limited performance. Then, I should verify which elements of history and examination are most informative to guide testing. Next, I will review the first-line objective tests to obtain and why they come first. After that, I need to check what not to do first, and correct any premature testing impulses. Finally, I will outline how subsequent tests follow in a tiered manner once the initial assessment narrows the differential.

> Let me first confirm the core principle: muscle weakness evaluation must start with a thorough history and physical examination to distinguish true loss of strength from fatigue, asthenia, or pain-limited movement, because this distinction shapes the entire diagnostic pathway and prevents unnecessary testing. Wait, let me verify that both primary care and specialty sources converge on this point; yes, multiple authoritative sources emphasize history and exam first, and recommend objective grading of strength to establish baseline severity and patterns of weakness before ordering ancillary tests [^116VvQJy] [^114rs1Wt] [^111wBuXL].

> I need to check which history elements are most informative. The first test, in effect, is a structured interview capturing onset and tempo, distribution, associated symptoms, medication and toxin exposures, family history, and functional impact. Hold on, I should verify that medication and toxin review is specifically highlighted; the AAFP explicitly recommends a medication and toxin review in patients with muscle weakness, which is critical given statins, steroids, and endocrine or metabolic drugs as contributors. I should also confirm that distinguishing symmetric proximal weakness from distal, focal, or bulbar patterns guides the localization and narrows the differential to myopathic, neuropathic, or neuromuscular junction etiologies [^112N2b4P] [^114rs1Wt] [^111LS3gC].

> Next, I should review the physical examination. I will now examine for objective strength testing with a validated scale, typically the Medical Research Council Manual Muscle Testing, to quantify severity and track change. Wait, I should double-check that this is endorsed as a first step; yes, AAFP recommends objective grading and a neurologic survey to localize deficits and identify patterns such as proximal versus distal, symmetric versus asymmetric, and upper versus lower motor neuron signs. I need to ensure I also assess for extramuscular clues like skin changes, joint involvement, or respiratory signs that suggest inflammatory myopathies or systemic disease, and I should remember that sarcopenia frameworks emphasize grip strength and gait speed as practical bedside measures when relevant [^114rs1Wt] [^116VvQJy] [^113sSfm8].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about ordering tests yet. I should confirm that no ancillary test should precede this clinical foundation, because premature testing without localization risks low yield and misinterpretation. The AAFP guidance explicitly states that history and physical examination guide subsequent laboratory testing, imaging, EMG, and muscle biopsy, reinforcing that the first "test" is the clinical assessment itself, not a lab or imaging order [^116VvQJy] [^114rs1Wt].

> Now, I need to identify the first-line objective tests to obtain after the clinical assessment narrows the field. Let me think about which simple, high-yield labs best screen for systemic, endocrine, inflammatory, and myopathic causes. The recommended initial laboratory panel typically includes creatine kinase to screen for muscle injury, thyroid-stimulating hormone for endocrine contributors, and basic electrolytes with renal and hepatic indices, with ESR or CRP and ANA added when inflammatory myopathy is suspected. Wait, I should verify CK's role and caveats; CK is a sensitive marker of muscle injury but can be elevated by exercise, medications, and other non-myopathic causes, so results must be interpreted in clinical context and with awareness of population reference ranges and preanalytical factors [^114rs1Wt] [^111wBuXL] [^1158bzqN].

> But wait, what if I was tempted to order EMG first because it seems "objective"? Hmm, wait a minute, I should correct that impulse. EMG and nerve conduction studies are indicated when the diagnosis remains unclear after history, examination, and targeted labs, or when specific entities like ALS, myasthenia gravis, neuropathy, or radiculopathy are suspected. I should confirm that guidelines place EMG after the initial clinical-laboratory screen; AAFP recommends EMG when the diagnosis is unclear after the initial steps, and electrodiagnostic testing is most informative when it extends a well-constructed clinical hypothesis rather than replaces it [^1142UJuE] [^114rs1Wt] [^114KJxd4].

> Next, I should review the subsequent tier. If CK is elevated or the clinical picture suggests a primary muscle disorder, I need to ensure I consider muscle MRI to characterize inflammation versus atrophy and to guide biopsy site selection, and I should reserve muscle biopsy for cases with objective weakness, elevated CK, or abnormal EMG/MRI when the etiology remains uncertain. Hold on, I should verify that biopsy is not a first test; yes, biopsy comes after the initial clinical-laboratory screen and adjunct imaging or EMG, consistent with guideline-based stepwise care [^115tgyVz] [^114rs1Wt].

> I should also consider special contexts. In suspected ICU-acquired weakness, bedside strength testing with MRC scoring or handgrip dynamometry is the appropriate initial diagnostic approach, with electrophysiology reserved for selected or uncooperative patients. In suspected Pompe disease, a blood-based GAA enzyme assay is the optimal initial test rather than biopsy, which can be falsely negative. In suspected statin-associated muscle symptoms, guidelines support CK testing when weakness is present, aligning with the principle of matching the first test to the leading clinical hypothesis after the initial assessment [^115mp21j] [^111qm6cr] [^113gkg8n].

> Let me reconsider the overall flow to ensure internal consistency. The first diagnostic "test" is a comprehensive history and physical examination to confirm true weakness, characterize its pattern, and identify red flags. The first-line objective tests after that are targeted laboratory studies, typically CK, TSH, electrolytes with renal and hepatic function, and inflammatory markers or ANA when indicated, chosen to efficiently screen for common systemic, endocrine, and myopathic causes. EMG, imaging, and biopsy follow selectively based on persistent diagnostic uncertainty or specific suspected entities, maintaining a tiered, hypothesis-driven approach that maximizes yield and minimizes unnecessary testing [^116VvQJy] [^114rs1Wt] [^1142UJuE].

---

The first diagnostic test for muscle weakness is a **focused history and physical examination** to confirm true weakness, characterize its pattern, and guide subsequent testing [^116VvQJy] [^114rs1Wt]. This step distinguishes weakness from fatigue or pain, identifies red flags, and narrows the differential before ordering labs or imaging [^111wBuXL]. If the cause remains unclear after the initial evaluation, **order creatine kinase (CK)** and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) as the first laboratory tests to screen for myopathy and endocrine causes [^114rs1Wt] [^114vPAEM]. Reserve **EMG** for cases with persistent diagnostic uncertainty or suspected neuromuscular junction, neuropathic, or radiculopathic etiologies [^1142UJuE] [^112VpJVz].

---

## Initial clinical evaluation

### History

During history-taking, confirm **true weakness** by distinguishing it from fatigue, asthenia, or pain-related motor impairment [^114rs1Wt]. Characterize the **pattern** — acute vs chronic, proximal vs distal, symmetric vs asymmetric, and any bulbar or respiratory involvement [^111LS3gC]. Screen for **red flags** such as rapid progression, respiratory or bulbar symptoms, sensory loss, or systemic signs (fever, weight loss, rash) [^notfound]. Review medications, toxins, and family history for hereditary neuromuscular disorders [^112N2b4P].

---

### Physical examination

- **Strength testing**: Use the Medical Research Council (MRC) scale to objectively grade strength [^114rs1Wt] [^115mp21j].

- **Neurologic survey**: Assess reflexes, tone, coordination, and sensory function to localize the lesion [^111LS3gC].

- **Pattern recognition**: Identify patterns such as proximal weakness (myopathy), distal weakness (neuropathy), or mixed patterns [^111LS3gC].

---

## First-line diagnostic tests

After the initial clinical evaluation, the **first-line diagnostic tests** include:

| **Test** | **Indication** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Creatine kinase (CK) | Suspected myopathy or muscle injury | Elevated CK suggests muscle damage (e.g. inflammatory myopathies, muscular dystrophies, rhabdomyolysis) [^1148TsSJ] [^111Hvba3] [^114yd8g7] |
| Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) | Suspected endocrine myopathy | Hypo- or hyperthyroidism can cause muscle weakness [^notfound] |
| Electrolytes (Na, K, Ca, Mg) | Suspected electrolyte imbalance | Abnormalities can cause neuromuscular symptoms [^111wBuXL] |
| Glucose | Suspected metabolic myopathy | Hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia can cause weakness [^notfound] |

---

## Indications for further diagnostic testing

If the initial evaluation and first-line tests are inconclusive, **further testing** is guided by clinical suspicion:

- **Electromyography (EMG) and nerve conduction studies (NCS)**: Indicated for suspected neuropathy, radiculopathy, or neuromuscular junction disorders (e.g. ALS, myasthenia gravis) [^114rs1Wt].

- **Muscle biopsy**: Considered when CK is elevated, EMG is abnormal, or a specific myopathy is suspected (e.g. inflammatory myopathies, metabolic myopathies) [^115tgyVz].

- **Genetic testing**: Indicated for suspected hereditary myopathies or neuromuscular disorders [^113DzCAY].

- **Imaging (MRI)**: Useful for suspected inflammatory myopathies, muscle infiltrative diseases, or to guide biopsy [^115zqN2Q].

---

## Special considerations

- **ICU-acquired weakness**: Diagnosis relies on clinical assessment (MRC scale) and electrophysiological studies (EMG/NCS) [^115mp21j] [^115esycN].

- **Functional neurological disorder**: Requires careful clinical examination to distinguish from organic weakness [^115TkwXT].

- **Pediatric patients**: CK is useful for screening myopathies, and genetic testing is often indicated for hereditary disorders [^114vPAEM] [^113DzCAY].

---

The first diagnostic test for muscle weakness is a **focused history and physical examination**, followed by **CK and TSH** if the cause remains unclear. This approach efficiently narrows the differential and guides further testing.

In cooperative patients, muscle strength should be assessed at the bedside using the MRC scale, handgrip dynamometry (HGD), or both. MRC sum score (MRCss) should be assessed as soon as the patient awakens and at ICU discharge at the very minimum, while handgrip dynamometry can be used as a quick screening tool throughout the ICU stay (Fig. 1). Critical care nurses may also identify signs and symptoms of severe weakness using a subjective assessment tool, and their findings should also be considered during interprofessional rounds.

Adapted from Parry SM, et al.

The term CIW condenses various neurophysiological and neuropathological entities with different prognoses into one single clinical entity. Therefore, if weakness persists, electrophysiological investigations of peripheral nerves and muscles and, in selected cases, muscle biopsy (Fig. 2) will eventually be required to define the specific pathological diagnosis and tailor the treatment plan. In the era of "precision critical care medicine", a more specific diagnosis may inform long-term prognosis (Table 1) and may hopefully enable targeted pharmacological treatments in the near future, as it is for other neuromuscular disorders with axonal nerve transport dysfunction or muscle electrical excitability alterations.

American Thoracic Society guideline — use of electrophysiological testing in diagnosing intensive care unit–acquired weakness (ICUAW) shows that 28 (2,248 patients) studies used electromyography (EMG) and 26 (1,813 patients) used nerve conduction studies (NCS); 15 studies found varying diagnostic thresholds, and five studies (191 patients) of direct muscle stimulation reported variability in muscles tested and diagnostic thresholds. Studies of EMG or NCS in uncooperative patients tended to perform the tests early during their ICU stay (e.g. Day 2–10), whereas studies in cooperative patients with abnormal MMT tended to perform them only if the abnormalities persisted (e.g., 2–7 d).

### Electrodiagnosis in neuromuscular disease [^114KJxd4]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Electromyography (EMG) is an important diagnostic tool for the assessment of individuals with various neuromuscular diseases. It should be an extension of a thorough history and physical examination. Some prototypical characteristics and findings of EMG and nerve conduction studies are discussed; however, a more thorough discussion can be found in the textbooks and resources sited in the article. With an increase in molecular genetic diagnostics, EMG continues to play an important role in the diagnosis and management of patients with neuromuscular diseases and also provides a cost-effective diagnostic workup before ordering a battery of costly genetic tests.

### Pearls&Oy-sters: use of muscle ultrasound as a clinical tool in INPP5K-related muscular dystrophy: a case report [^115ASLxM]. Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Biallelic pathogenic variants in INPP5K have been associated with a rare congenital muscular dystrophy that presents with muscle weakness, short stature, intellectual disability, and early-onset cataracts. A characteristic pattern of muscle involvement has been identified on muscle MRI in a small case series, including involvement of the vasti, anterior tibialis, and peronei with relative sparing of the rectus femoris, sartorius, and gracilis muscles. This case describes a patient who initially presented in infancy with hypotonia, motor delays, and short stature. She was eventually diagnosed at almost 3 years with INPP5K -related muscular dystrophy after extensive workup that included multiple subspecialist evaluations, genetic testing for non-neuromuscular disorders, and a muscle biopsy. Muscle ultrasound (MUS) was performed at the end of this diagnostic journey, which demonstrated characteristic features that supported the diagnosis, including notable involvement of the vasti muscles with sparing of the rectus femoris. This case highlights how MUS can be a useful tool in the evaluation of children for neuromuscular disorders. MUS can help refine the differential and guide further steps in evaluation when performed early in the diagnostic process and may help clarify interpretation of genetic testing results when performed later.

### The diagnostic journey of patients being investigated for myopathy in a tertiary centre in england [^114naB4W]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Myopathies are heterogenous and can provide a diagnostic puzzle. Many patients investigated for myopathy will go on to other diagnoses. An overall understanding of how patients are investigated for suspected myopathy is lacking. Our aim was to understand how patients were investigated for myopathy in our tertiary centre and the timeline of their diagnostic journey. Through local database searches over a 5-year period (2015–2019), we identified a final total of 770 patients investigated for myopathy. Of these, 29.7% went on to a diagnosis of myopathy. The top non-myopathy diagnoses were neuropathy, spinal pathology and ataxia. Both the myopathy and non-myopathy groups had symptoms for an extended period before reaching specialist services (both groups 104 weeks). Following a first hospital visit, median time to diagnosis was not significantly different (myopathy 46.9 weeks, non-myopathy 40.7 weeks, p > 0.05). Data on the diagnostic journey for specific myopathies was also collected, with inflammatory myopathies diagnosed most quickly and muscular dystrophies most slowly. Muscle MRI and biopsy had the best positive predictive values (82.7% and 83.1%, respectively), while EMG had the best negative predictive value (89.3%). A combination of CK, EMG and neuroaxis MRI (brain and spinal cord) yielded at least one correct test result with respect to final diagnosis in 98.9% of cases. In conclusion, patients in whom a muscle disease is considered experience significant diagnostic delay. The first step in the diagnostic journey should be able to identify both myopathy and non-myopathy cases.

### A stronger approach to weakness in the intensive care unit [^1155wPaZ]. Critical Care (2004). Low credibility.

ICU-acquired limb and respiratory muscle weakness is a common, serious ICU syndrome, increasing in frequency with prolonged ICU stay and sepsis. A systematic approach facilitates precise localization of the problem within central or peripheral nervous system. Most cases relate to critical illness polyneuropathy or myopathy or a combination of both (critical illness neuromyopathy). Within the latter entity, the relative contribution of neuropathy versus myopathy varies considerably among affected patients. Muscle enzyme testing, electromyography-nerve conduction and muscle biopsy are valuable investigative tests. Nerve biopsy is less commonly needed, but is useful when vascultis is suspected.

### How to do it: investigate exertional rhabdomyolysis (or not) [^111Xh7su]. Practical Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Rhabdomyolysis is the combination of symptoms (myalgia, weakness and muscle swelling) and a substantial rise in serum creatine kinase (CK) > 50 000 IU/L; there are many causes, but here we specifically address exertional rhabdomyolysis. The consequences of this condition can be severe, including acute kidney injury and requirement for higher level care with organ support. Most patients have 'physiological' exertional rhabdomyolysis with no underlying disease; they do not need investigation and should be advised to return to normal activities in a graded fashion. Rarely, exertional rhabdomyolysis may be the initial presentation of underlying muscle disease, and we review how to identify this much smaller group of patients, who do require investigation.

### Diagnostic accuracy of electrodiagnostic testing in the evaluation of weakness [^112VpJVz]. Muscle & Nerve (2002). Low credibility.

Electrodiagnostic testing is often used in the evaluation of patients presenting with weakness, but the diagnostic accuracy of the test in this setting is unknown. We prospectively identified 100 patients presenting to our electromyography (EMG) laboratory with the chief complaint of weakness, and compared their referring diagnosis with the electrophysiological diagnosis reached after electrodiagnostic testing. We reviewed each patient's medical record 9 months after EMG to yield a final diagnosis. Electrodiagnostic testing led to a single diagnosis in 79% of the cases; in 31%, this diagnosis was unsuspected by the referring clinician. Adequate follow-up was available for 79% of the patients. The electrodiagnostic testing resulted in a single, correct diagnosis in 73% of the patients and provided more than one possible diagnosis, one of which was correct, in an additional 18%, for an overall diagnostic accuracy of 91% in this group of patients presenting with weakness.

### Clinical reasoning: a woman with subacute progression of distal upper extremity weakness [^115fdbe3]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

A 65-year-old woman presented with 3 months of progressive hand weakness, initially with distal-predominant symptoms. EMG was notable for diminished amplitudes in bilateral radial nerves without evidence of conduction block and with normal sensory nerve action potentials. Anti-acetylcholine receptor and antistriated muscle antibodies were positive, but subsequent EMG did not reveal abnormalities on repetitive nerve stimulation. Muscle biopsy was performed, revealing extensive inflammatory infiltrates with significant associated fibrosis. This case discusses the approach to localization within the motor pathway and the use of serologic studies, imaging, and electrodiagnostic testing to supplement history and examination.

### The value of multiple tests of respiratory muscle strength [^116f4Qzr]. Thorax (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Respiratory muscle weakness is an important clinical problem. Tests of varying complexity and invasiveness are available to assess respiratory muscle strength. The relative precision of different tests in the detection of weakness is less clear, as is the value of multiple tests.

Methods

The respiratory muscle function tests of clinical referrals who had multiple tests assessed in our laboratories over a 6-year period were analysed. Thresholds for weakness for each test were determined from published and in-house laboratory data. The patients were divided into three groups: those who had all relevant measurements of global inspiratory muscle strength (group A, n = 182), those with full assessment of diaphragm strength (group B, n = 264) and those for whom expiratory muscle strength was fully evaluated (group C, n = 60). The diagnostic outcome of each inspiratory, diaphragm and expiratory muscle test, both singly and in combination, was studied and the impact of using more than one test to detect weakness was calculated.

Results

The clinical referrals were primarily for the evaluation of neuromuscular diseases and dyspnoea of unknown cause. A low maximal inspiratory mouth pressure (Pimax) was recorded in 40.1% of referrals in group A, while a low sniff nasal pressure (Sniff Pnasal) was recorded in 41.8% and a low sniff oesophageal pressure (Sniff Poes) in 37.9%. When assessing inspiratory strength with the combination of all three tests, 29.6% of patients had weakness. Using the two non-invasive tests (Pimax and Sniff Pnasal) in combination, a similar result was obtained (low in 32.4%). Combining Sniff Pdi (low in 68.2%) and Twitch Pdi (low in 67.4%) reduced the diagnoses of patients with diaphragm weakness to 55.3% in group B. 38.3% of the patients in group C had expiratory muscle weakness as measured by maximum expiratory pressure (Pemax) compared with 36.7% when weakness was diagnosed by cough gastric pressure (Pgas), and 28.3% when assessed by Twitch T10. Combining all three expiratory muscle tests reduced the number of patients diagnosed as having expiratory muscle weakness to 16.7%.

Conclusion

The use of single tests such as Pimax, Pemax and other available individual tests of inspiratory, diaphragm and expiratory muscle strength tends to overdiagnose weakness. Combinations of tests increase diagnostic precision and, in the population studied, they reduced the diagnosis of inspiratory, specific diaphragm and expiratory muscle weakness by 19–56%. Measuring both Pimax and Sniff Pnasal resulted in a relative reduction of 19.2% of patients falsely diagnosed with inspiratory muscle weakness. The addition of Twitch Pdi to Sniff Pdi increased diagnostic precision by a smaller amount (18.9%). Having multiple tests of respiratory muscle function available both increases diagnostic precision and makes assessment possible in a range of clinical circumstances.

### Sarcopenia: revised European consensus on definition and diagnosis [^113sSfm8]. Age and Ageing (2019). Medium credibility.

Summary and call-to-action

Sarcopenia, i.e. muscle failure, is a muscle disease rooted in adverse muscle changes that accrue across a lifetime; sarcopenia is common among adults of older age but can also occur earlier in life. Sarcopenia is defined by low levels of measures for three parameters: (1) muscle strength, (2) muscle quantity/quality and (3) physical performance as an indicator of severity.

Although research findings over the last decade have answered many questions, other findings raised more areas for researchers to address in the future. Thus, a clear definition of sarcopenia, as well as clear diagnostic criteria, are necessary to guide both clinical practice and research design for the future.

For screening and diagnosis of sarcopenia, EWGSOP recommends following the pathway: Find cases-Assess-Confirm-Severity (F-A-C-S).

Find-cases: To identify individuals at risk for sarcopenia, EWGSOP advises use of the SARC-F questionnaire or clinical suspicion to find sarcopenia-associated symptoms.

Assess: To assess for evidence of sarcopenia, EWGSOP recommends use of grip strength or a chair stand measure with specific cut-off-points for each test. For special cases and for research studies, other methods for measurement of strength (knee flexion/extension) can be used.

Confirm: To confirm sarcopenia by detection of low muscle quantity and quality, DXA is advised in clinical practice, and DXA, BIA, CT or MRI in research studies.

Determine Severity: Severity can be evaluated by performance measures; gait speed, SPPB, TUG and 400-m walk tests can be used.

### Postpolio syndrome and the late effects of poliomyelitis. part 1. pathogenesis, biomechanical considerations, diagnosis, and investigations [^112Aqave]. Muscle & Nerve (2018). Low credibility.

Postpolio syndrome (PPS) is characterized by new muscle weakness and/or muscle fatigability that occurs many years after the initial poliomyelitis illness. Many theories exist regarding the pathogenesis of PPS, which remains incompletely understood. In contrast, the late effects of poliomyelitis are often a consequence of biomechanical alterations that occur as a result of polio-related surgeries, musculoskeletal deformities, or weakness. Osteoporosis and fractures of the polio-involved limbs are common. A comprehensive clinical evaluation with appropriate investigations is essential to fulfilling the established PPS diagnostic criteria. PPS is a diagnosis of exclusion in which a key clinical feature required for the diagnosis is new muscle weakness and/or muscle fatigability that is persistent for at least 1 year. Electromyographic and muscle biopsy findings including evidence of ongoing denervation cannot reliably distinguish between patients with or without PPS. Muscle Nerve 58:751–759, 2018.

### Value of MRI in diagnostics and evaluation of myositis [^115zqN2Q]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review aims at covering the role of muscle MRI in supporting the diagnosis of myositis, in aiding to differentiate it from other muscle disorders, and in monitoring myositis patients over time by assessing response to treatment and by discriminating between muscle inflammation and chronic damage.

Recent Findings

MRI can assist in 'pattern recognition' of muscle involvement across numerous myopathies, including myositis. Novel applications of magnetic resonance such as cardiac MRI, MR elastography and blood oxigenation level-dependent magnetic resonance can shed light on different aspects of myositis and usefully complement conventional MRI in assessing patients with myositis.

Summary

MRI can guide therapy by determining whether muscle weakness is related to edema (active inflammation) or muscle atrophy/fat replacement (chronic damage). There is a need to better standardize the assessment of MRI findings in myositis to provide defined outcome measures for use in clinical trials. VIDEO ABSTRACT.

### Consensus disease definitions for neurologic immune-related adverse events of immune checkpoint inhibitors [^112JeLmi]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

Immune-related myopathy (irMyopathy)

Subtypes, evaluation and definitions of irMyopathy syndromes are presented in table 7. The rationale for common, possible and uncommon disease-specific testing is outlined.

Table 7
irMyopathy

Common

Diagnostic evaluation for irMyopathy includes CK to assess for muscle breakdown. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) are typically elevated along with CK. Gammaglutamyl transferase (GGT) evaluates for liver-specific injury and is normal when AST/ALT elevations are due to muscle disease. EDX evaluate for muscle membrane irritability (indicated by fibrillation potentials and positive sharp waves), which can be seen in inflammatory or necrotizing myopathy, and for myopathic motor unit potentials (characterized by short duration, with or without low amplitude and/or early recruitment). EMG should include needle examination of clinically weak muscles and thoracic paraspinals. Of note, abnormalities in motor unit potentials may be patchy or subtle, and recruitment is often normal, particularly in the acute setting. EDX are often performed with repetitive nerve stimulation of proximal nerve-muscle combinations to test for an overlapping neuromuscular junction disorder. Troponin-I, EKG, and echocardiogram may be used for initial screening for concurrent myocarditis. While troponin-T may beelevated with myositis, troponin-I is more specific for cardiac injury.

### An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline: the diagnosis of intensive care unit-acquired weakness in adults [^115A7wnB]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

ICU-acquired weakness (ICUAW) diagnosis — test limitations and emphasis on strength assessment is described as follows: The diagnostic tests used to identify ICUAW are limited by reproducibility, narrow application windows, and lack of a validated gold standard, and volitional testing is challenging; despite this, no more reliable test has emerged. The document states that the assessment of strength is emphasized as a primary way to identify patients, while acknowledging that electrophysiology has aided understanding and may help determine response to interventions; if so, the assumption that electrophysiology should be secondary to physical signs of weakness may need to change in diagnostic approaches.

### Clinical practice guideline for diagnostic testing for adult obstructive sleep apnea: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^1131aLbT]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Adult obstructive sleep apnea diagnostic testing — Recommendations define the roles of polysomnography (PSG) and home sleep apnea testing (HSAT) and limit the use of clinical tools. The guideline states: "We recommend that clinical tools, questionnaires or prediction algorithms not be used to diagnose OSA in adults, in the absence of PSG or HSAT". It further states: "We recommend that PSG, or HSAT with a technically adequate device, be used for the diagnosis of OSA in uncomplicated adult patients presenting with signs and symptoms that indicate an increased risk of moderate to severe OSA". It adds: "We recommend that if a single HSAT is negative, inconclusive or technically inadequate, PSG be performed for the diagnosis of OSA". For specific comorbidities and risks, it specifies: "We recommend that PSG, rather than HSAT, be used for the diagnosis of OSA in patients with significant cardiorespiratory disease, potential respiratory muscle weakness due to neuromuscular condition, awake hypoventilation or suspicion of sleep related hypoventilation, chronic opioid medication use, history of stroke or severe insomnia". Diagnostic protocols include: "We suggest that, if clinically appropriate, a split-night diagnostic protocol, rather than a full-night diagnostic protocol for PSG be used for the diagnosis of OSA". and "We suggest that when the initial PSG is negative, and there is suspicion for OSA, a second PSG be considered for the diagnosis of OSA".

### What are the normal serum creatine kinase values for skeletal muscle? A worldwide systematic review [^1158bzqN]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Creatine kinase (CK) has been recognized as an essential marker for muscle disease since 1959. It is universally utilized in the diagnostic evaluation of neuromuscular disorders; however, high CK levels often appear in oligo‐symptomatic or asymptomatic individuals. Oligosymptomatic individuals may experience nonspecific muscle symptoms, including myalgia, stiffness, fatigue, or muscle cramps. Such symptoms were common in individuals with either normal CK or hyperCKemia in the Tromsø study, the largest epidemiologic study of hyperCKemia in the general population. The prevalence of hyperCKemia in the Tromsø study, which included 12,828 individuals, was 1.3%. Although CK is a marker of primary muscle disease, various non‐myopathic causes can result in oligo/asymptomatic hyperCKemia. These include strenuous exercise, certain medications (especially statins), as well as cardiac, endocrine, and metabolic conditions, trauma, intramuscular injections, and alcohol, among others. Similarly, normal values are influenced by gender, race, and age. Therefore, establishing an appropriate normal range for CK is crucial before deciding to investigate a patient further, especially if they are oligo/asymptomatic. This decision is especially relevant today, as next‐generation sequencing can offer a prompt and precise diagnosis. The accepted approach to managing muscle disease that presents with oligo/asymptomatic hyperCKemia is to diagnose and treat it early and, when appropriate, provide genetic counseling for the family. The significance of establishing normal CK levels was emphasized by the EFNS Guideline group task force, which discussed the diagnostic approach to oligo/asymptomatic hyperCKemia. We conducted a systematic review to better estimate the normal values of total CK in different racial groups. In the study, the total CK is referred to as CK.

### An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline: the diagnosis of intensive care unit-acquired weakness in adults [^111UPV7S]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

American Thoracic Society guideline — manual muscle testing (MMT) for diagnosing intensive care unit–acquired weakness (ICUAW) was evaluated in Twenty-six studies (2,318 patients), with Thirteen of those studies (887 patients) using a composite MRC score and Nine of the studies (669 patients) stating an MRC threshold; Seven of these studies (494 patients) used less than 80% of the maximum score to diagnose ICUAW, and Only four studies quantified cooperation before MMT. MMT was correlated with EMG/NCS in 12 studies, with in the aggregate (214 patients) showing that 80% of subjects with abnormal EMG/NCS studies had moderate to severe weakness, the frequency of clinical weakness not varying by MRC threshold (77% in MRC thresholds vs. 84% in other definitions of weakness, P = 0.2), and the frequency of EMG abnormalities (> 95%) not varying with use of MRC.

### Expert perspective: diagnostic approach to differentiating juvenile dermatomyositis from muscular dystrophy [^116nxYtw]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

A child presenting with proximal muscle weakness has a broad differential diagnosis, which requires a thoughtful, detailed work‐up to arrive at a specific diagnosis. In our case report patient, diagnosis was delayed by 6 months because of an initial presumed diagnosis of MD. When genetic testing did not reveal a clear cause of myopathy, the diagnosis was reconsidered. To more quickly differentiate between JDM and MD, which can present very similarly, and improve time to diagnosis and treatment, we have presented a proposed diagnostic work‐up algorithm to aid in clinical assessment and decision‐making when a child presents with weakness and no definite rash of JDM (Figure 1). We highlight a few key decision points that can aid in more quickly arriving at a definitive diagnosis of JDM: (1) NFC, (2) MSA testing, and (3) muscle biopsy.

NFC is a fast, noninvasive imaging tool that can be paired with initial diagnostic examination to reveal clues as to whether a patient has an underlying systemic inflammatory process or vasculopathy. Next, if there is a high index of suspicion for JDM based on clinical features, MSA testing can be ordered with the initial laboratory tests. If positive, MSAs facilitate diagnostic clarity and assist in clinical phenotyping to further direct urgency of screening for other major organ involvement. Finally, obtaining a pretreatment muscle biopsy can provide invaluable insight into tissue‐specific changes to differentiate an inflammatory from noninflammatory myopathy and can also provide prognostic information. Moreover, muscle biopsies can be stored, with anticipated later application of novel technologies to guide personalized medical care, such as single‐cell RNA‐sequencing. In looking to the future in JDM diagnosis, we anticipate not only advances in the utility of NFC, MSA testing, and biopsy but also the development of novel biomarker signatures to guide care based on precision medicine.

### How to use: creatine kinase [^114vPAEM]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2020). Medium credibility.

Creatine kinase (CK) remains an essential tool for assessment of muscular weakness and pain in children despite the advent of advanced diagnostic tests in this field. It is also useful in diagnosing and monitoring various other conditions. This article will explore the physiology of CK and clinical situations where the estimation of CK can help the clinicians' decision-making process with the diagnosis and management of these conditions. Some clinical scenarios are used to highlight how the tests can be used in different clinical situations. The role of CK as a biomarker of myocardial injury has been purposefully omitted in this article.

Her joint and neurovascular findings are normal. Testing reveals a 1: 40 antinuclear antibody titer and a weakly positive rheumatoid factor titer of 22 IU per mL. What diagnostic tests, if any, should be ordered next. Mixed Connective Tissue Disease Mixed connective tissue disease is an overlap syndrome of SLE, myositis, and scleroderma. Patients classically present with the Raynaud phenomenon, pulmonary hypertension, arthritis, and myositis. When mixed connective tissue disease is suspected, an ANA titer is the best initial screening test; if results are positive, further testing should include antiribonucleoprotein antibodies. Although these antibodies are present in several connective tissue disorders, their sensitivity for diagnosing mixed connective tissue disease is 71% to 100%, and the specificity is 84% to 100%.
18.

Scleroderma Scleroderma is a clinical syndrome characterized by tight skin, interstitial lung disease, pulmonary hypertension, and diffuse organ fibrosis. Although this condition is rare, antibody testing can help with the diagnosis. Initial testing should include an ANA titer; if results are positive, further testing should include anticentromere and anti-Scl 70 antibodies, which are present in patients with limited and diffuse scleroderma, respectively. The presence of anti-Scl 70 antibodies is associated with increased mortality and a greater incidence of interstitial lung disease. Dermatomyositis and Polymyositis The inflammatory muscle diseases dermatomyositis and polymyositis should be suspected in patients who have muscle weakness with elevated levels of muscle enzymes such as creatine kinase, myopathic changes on electromyography, and characteristic muscle pathology. Approximately 80% of patients with dermatomyositis or polymyositis have a positive ANA titer.

Rheumatoid Arthritis RHEUMATOID FACTOR Rheumatoid arthritis is a symmetric small-joint arthropathy affecting the hands, wrists, and feet and is associated with joint pain and morning stiffness. Autoantibody testing can be helpful in establishing the diagnosis. RF is an autoantibody produced from polyclonal β cell activation. Testing is typically for immunoglobulin M RF. A positive RF titer in a patient with joint pain increases the probability of rheumatoid arthritis. The higher the titer, the more likely the patient will have erosive joint disease, extra-articular manifestations, and a poor outcome.

### Electrodiagnostic approach to patients with weakness [^111vcD4e]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Electrodiagnosis has a key role in the evaluation of patients presenting with weakness. The electrodiagnostician should maintain a broad inclusive differential diagnosis and tailor the examination using a sound conceptual framework. A clear understanding of what is normal provides the proper foundation upon which to judge electrodiagnostic findings. Many peripheral neuromuscular conditions manifest themselves in characteristic ways on NEE and nerve conduction testing, making them identifiable to the skilled electrodiagnostic medicine consultant.

### Diagnostic evaluation for myositis and their pitfalls [^114sLT6P]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Myositis is a systemic autoimmune disorder that affects multiple organ systems, including the skeletal muscles, lungs, skin, and joints. The clinical presentation can vary significantly, and physicians must tailor the diagnostic evaluation for each patient, reflecting a personalized approach rather than relying on a standardized routine order set. Each diagnostic test has its own advantages, limitations, and pitfalls, requiring careful interpretation of results to make appropriate clinical decisions. In this article, we discuss the clinical applications of laboratory tests, myositis antibodies, imaging, electromyography, and muscle histopathology with key points to consider when interpreting the results.

### Diagnostic criteria for late-onset (childhood and adult) Pompe disease [^116zqoRQ]. Muscle & Nerve (2009). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of late-onset (childhood and adult) Pompe disease can often be challenging, as it is a rare disease and the heterogeneous clinical presentation can mimic the presentation of other neuromuscular disorders. The objective was to develop a consensus-based algorithm for the diagnosis of late-onset Pompe disease. A systematic literature search was conducted, and an expert panel composed of neuromuscular specialists and individuals with expertise in Pompe disease reviewed the literature and convened for consensus development. An algorithm for the diagnosis of late-onset Pompe disease was created. Patients presenting with either a limb-girdle syndrome or dyspnea secondary to diaphragm weakness should undergo further testing, including evaluations of muscle strength, motor function, and pulmonary function. A blood-based acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA) enzyme activity assay is the recommended tool to screen for GAA enzyme deficiency. The diagnosis should be confirmed by a second test: either a second GAA enzyme activity assay in another tissue or GAA gene sequencing.

### A conceptual framework: the early and late phases of skeletal muscle dysfunction in the acute respiratory distress syndrome [^111pihqU]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of intensive care unit-acquired weakness

Since the original report by MacFarlane and Rosenthal, muscle wasting associated with critical illness has been called acute quadriparetic myopathy, thick filament myopathy, critical illness myopathy, critical illness polyneuropathy, and ICU-acquired paresis, among other terms. These names reflect the varying associated pathologic and electrophysiologic characteristics. The nomenclature has recently been simplified, and the term ICUAW signifies clinically measureable weakness in a critically ill patient without other known precipitating factors causing nerve or muscle injury.

The diagnosis of ICUAW is made by using either manual muscle testing (MMT) or grip strength meters and by using specified cutoff values to denote weakness. Unfortunately, MMT is effort-dependent and insensitive and likely under-represents the degree of muscle dysfunction present in these patients. MMT, grip strength meters, and hand-held dynamometers also all lack the ability to clearly discern muscle fatigability, which may contribute to the long-term functional impairments in ICU survivors. Other functional tests - such as the short physical performance battery, six-minute walk distance, or walk speeds - may provide more information about global function, although these composite functional tests can be affected by factors other than muscle dysfunction and require a cooperative, engaged patient.

ICU-acquired weakness (ICUAW) diagnostic context emphasizes that early rehabilitation is not the only reason to identify ICUAW; a diagnosis prevents unnecessary testing for alternative diagnoses and improves the accuracy of counseling about the anticipated duration of mechanical ventilation and the appropriate timing for transition from intensive to rehabilitative care. There is no consensus approach to the diagnosis of ICUAW, including how or when it can be made, and it is also uncertain how electrophysiological studies should be used. To address such uncertainties, a panel was convened in March of 2009.

### A practical guide to assessing functional motor weakness: a review of validated techniques [^115ZHG99]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Interpretation and limitations

Motor inconsistency is present when a patient, who initially cannot perform a specific task, such as moving a limb against gravity or using a particular muscle group during the baseline assessment, demonstrates these abilities when transitioning from supine to sitting at the edge of the bed, standing, or walking.

The validation study for motor inconsistency, like give-way weakness, does not provide a detailed description of the standardized exam used. This makes both the examination and the interpretation of motor inconsistency difficult to attribute clinically. Furthermore, given motor inconsistency was only tested in 7 study participants with FLW and reported a sensitivity of only 13%, this sign likely has a low reliability of ruling out FLW, despite its 98% specificity.

This test may be best used to assess patients with severe weakness, as compensatory maneuvers by complementary muscle groups may be present to help the patient overcome mild weakness when completing complex movements.

### Sarcopenia: revised European consensus on definition and diagnosis [^111tZ3Ym]. Age and Ageing (2019). Medium credibility.

Filling the gaps for sarcopenia awareness, care and research design

Many aspects of the epidemiology and pathophysiology of sarcopenia are better understood today than 10 years ago. Researchers have identified links between muscle pathology and adverse health outcomes, and studies have also provided evidence that certain treatment strategies can help prevent or delay adverse consequences.

Such new insights led EWGSOP2 to review, 'What is new?' and 'How can we use this knowledge to improve care for people with sarcopenia and to guide future research studies?' These insights include:
First, sarcopenia has long been associated with ageing and older people, but the development of sarcopenia is now recognised to begin earlier in life, and the sarcopenia phenotype has many contributing causes beyond ageing. These insights have implications for interventions that prevent or delay development of sarcopenia.
Second, sarcopenia is now considered a muscle disease (muscle failure), with low muscle strength overtaking the role of low muscle mass as a principal determinant. This change is expected to facilitate prompt identification of sarcopenia in practice.
Third, sarcopenia is associated with low muscle quantity and quality, but these parameters are now used mainly in research rather than in clinical practice. Muscle mass and muscle quality are technically difficult to measure accurately.
Fourth, sarcopenia has been overlooked and undertreated in mainstream practice, apparently due to the complexity of determining what variables to measure, how to measure them, what cut-off points best guide diagnosis and treatment, and how to best evaluate effects of therapeutic interventions. To this end, EWGSOP2 aims to provide clear rationale for selection of diagnostic measures and cut-off points relevant to clinical practice.

To enhance awareness and care for sarcopenia, the EWGSOP2 has updated its definition and diagnostic strategies in 2018. Specific goals for the updates were to: (1) build a sarcopenia definition that reflects recent advances in scientific, epidemiological, and clinical knowledge about skeletal muscle, (2) identify variables that best detect sarcopenia and predict outcomes, and determine best tools for measuring each variable, (3) advise cut-off points for measured variables and (4) recommend an updated screening and assessment pathway that is easy to use in clinical practice.

### Sarcopenia: revised European consensus on definition and diagnosis [^111rh8JM]. Age and Ageing (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

in 2010, the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People (EWGSOP) published a sarcopenia definition that aimed to foster advances in identifying and caring for people with sarcopenia. In early 2018, the Working Group met again (EWGSOP2) to update the original definition in order to reflect scientific and clinical evidence that has built over the last decade. This paper presents our updated findings.

Objectives

to increase consistency of research design, clinical diagnoses and ultimately, care for people with sarcopenia.

Recommendations

sarcopenia is a muscle disease (muscle failure) rooted in adverse muscle changes that accrue across a lifetime; sarcopenia is common among adults of older age but can also occur earlier in life. In this updated consensus paper on sarcopenia, EWGSOP2: (1) focuses on low muscle strength as a key characteristic of sarcopenia, uses detection of low muscle quantity and quality to confirm the sarcopenia diagnosis, and identifies poor physical performance as indicative of severe sarcopenia; (2) updates the clinical algorithm that can be used for sarcopenia case-finding, diagnosis and confirmation, and severity determination and (3) provides clear cut-off points for measurements of variables that identify and characterise sarcopenia.

Conclusions

EWGSOP2's updated recommendations aim to increase awareness of sarcopenia and its risk. With these new recommendations, EWGSOP2 calls for healthcare professionals who treat patients at risk for sarcopenia to take actions that will promote early detection and treatment. We also encourage more research in the field of sarcopenia in order to prevent or delay adverse health outcomes that incur a heavy burden for patients and healthcare systems.

### Illness weakness, polyneuropathy and myopathy: diagnosis, treatment, and long-term outcomes [^111VdwAe]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Severe weakness associated with critical illness (CIW) is common. This narrative review summarizes the latest scientific insights and proposes a guide for clinicians to optimize the diagnosis and management of the CIW during the various stages of the disease from the ICU to the community stage.

Main Body

CIW arises as diffuse, symmetrical weakness after ICU admission, which is an important differentiating factor from other diseases causing non-symmetrical muscle weakness or paralysis. In patients with adequate cognitive function, CIW can be easily diagnosed at the bedside using manual muscle testing, which should be routinely conducted until ICU discharge. In patients with delirium or coma or those with prolonged, severe weakness, specific neurophysiological investigations and, in selected cases, muscle biopsy are recommended. With these exams, CIW can be differentiated into critical illness polyneuropathy or myopathy, which often coexist. On the general ward, CIW is seen in patients with prolonged previous ICU treatment, or in those developing a new sepsis. Respiratory muscle weakness can cause neuromuscular respiratory failure, which needs prompt recognition and rapid treatment to avoid life-threatening situations. Active rehabilitation should be reassessed and tailored to the new patient's condition to reduce the risk of disease progression. CIW is associated with long-term physical, cognitive and mental impairments, which emphasizes the need for a multidisciplinary model of care. Follow-up clinics for patients surviving critical illness may serve this purpose by providing direct clinical support to patients, managing referrals to other specialists and general practitioners, and serving as a platform for research to describe the natural history of post-intensive care syndrome and to identify new therapeutic interventions. This surveillance should include an assessment of the activities of daily living, mood, and functional mobility. Finally, nutritional status should be longitudinally assessed in all ICU survivors and incorporated into a patient-centered nutritional approach guided by a dietician.

Conclusions

Early ICU mobilization combined with the best evidence-based ICU practices can effectively reduce short-term weakness. Multi-professional collaborations are needed to guarantee a multi-dimensional evaluation and unitary community care programs for survivors of critical illnesses.

### Clinical features that distinguish PLS, upper motor neuron-dominant ALS, and typical ALS [^114PU4z4]. Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine how clinical features at the first evaluation and in follow-up can be used to suggest a diagnostic outcome for patients with only upper motor neuron (UMN) signs at disease onset.

Methods

We reviewed the records of 34 patients (9 primary lateral sclerosis [PLS], 15 UMN-dominant amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [ALS], and 10 randomly selected control patients with ALS) seen in 1984–2007. Analysis of variance F tests for continuous variables and chi2 tests for categorical variables analyzed differences in baseline data among the diagnostic categories. Linear and generalized mixed effects models assessed the relation between examination data and diagnostic group over time.

Results

At first examination, the lowest score of the weakest muscle (p < 0.001), the site of onset (p = 0.041), and time to evaluation (p = 0.05) discriminated between eventual diagnostic group; patients with PLS were stronger, slower in progressing, and more likely to have limb onset than the other groups. Strength ≤ 4 on any muscle was associated with the diagnosis of ALS (p = 0.0001), but not PLS. Across all visits, muscle strength (p = 0.003), ALS Functional Rating Scale score (p = 0.009), and vital capacity (p = 0.026) predicted group assignment. UMN-dominant and ALS groups had more weight loss (p = 0.004), even when controlled for dysphagia (p = 0.021) and muscle atrophy (p = 0.009), and patients with ALS were more likely to have hyporeflexia (p = 0.001).

Conclusions

Features at baseline most suggestive of eventual lower motor neuron signs were focal muscle weakness or bulbar onset. Later, weight loss, reduced forced vital capacity, and limb weakness predicted lower motor neuron dysfunction. We suggest that patients with only upper motor neuron signs have periodic evaluations of strength, weight, forced vital capacity, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale score, and EMG, because a change in any can signal the imminent development of lower motor neuron signs.

### Muscle weakness with a hidden cause [^113tYoWg]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

According to guidelines, glucocorticoids with an initial dose (prednisone equivalent) of 1 mg/kg body weight per day, combined with azathioprine or methotrexate, are sufficient in most cases on the new diagnosis of DM. As other cases with severe clinical courses benefitted from high-dose glucocorticoid regimens, we opted for the same approach, which later necessitated a second-line therapy with IVIG due to symptom exacerbation under first-line therapy.

Learning points

In idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM), a comprehensive clinical evaluation — including diagnostic investigations such as laboratory parameters and antibody profiling — is essential for accurate diagnosis.
Both clinical and laboratory findings can provide valuable insights into the risk of an underlying malignancy.
Cancer screening should be guided by risk stratification to avoid missing a malignancy and to ensure appropriate causal treatment.
A thorough search for rarely associated malignancies is warranted.

### Manual muscle testing: does it meet the standards of an adequate screening test? [^112Gt8AN]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and diagnostic accuracy of manual muscle testing.

Design

Secondary analysis of cross-sectional strength data.

Setting

Acute rehabilitation unit.

Participants

Convenience sample of 107 consecutive qualifying rehabilitation inpatients.

Intervention

Not applicable.

Main Outcome Measures

Knee extension forces measured by manual muscle testing and hand-held dynamometry.

Results

The ability of manual muscle testing to detect 15, 20, 25 and 30% between-side differences and deficits in knee extension force was described. Although the specificity of manual muscle testing was acceptable (mostly > 80%), its sensitivity to differences between sides and to deficits relative to normal never exceeded 75%. Its diagnostic accuracy was never greater than 78%.

Conclusion

The results of this study cast doubt on the suitability of manual muscle testing as a screening test for strength impairments.

### Exercise in clinical reasoning: getting a foothold on lower extremity weakness [^112FKN8v]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Revisiting the patient's presentation with new data allows one to shift the differential of common neurological and muscular causes of motor weakness to the suspicion of a glomerular disease that could cause motor weakness. Common causes of motor weakness have been excluded and now rare presentations of glomerulonephritis should be considered.

The clinician has reframed the patient's problem representation which allows the focus to shift the evaluation and differential from proximal motor weakness and acute kidney injury to glomerulonephritis. The case now has a diagnostic clue of which can suggest a new path forward: glomerulonephritis. This disease process serves as a diagnostic foothold. 11 An analogy to a diagnostic foothold to a clinician is like a base camp for a mountain explorer. Having a logical position to "start" the work up allows one to branch out and explore (or in this case, vasculitis syndromes that can present with glomerulonephritis).

By using glomerulonephritis as a diagnostic foothold, the clinician can review the most common forms of glomerulonephritis and compare the patient's presentation to illness scripts of different types of GN.

ANA was positive with a 1:160 titer with an atypical speckled pattern. Perinuclear ANCA was positive with a 1:320 titer. Anti-GBM was negative. Complement levels were normal. HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C tests were negative. A muscle biopsy and kidney biopsy were obtained.

The constellation of symptoms and labs raises the concern of a vasculitis causing glomerulonephritis and myopathy. The patient's presentation and ANCA positivity suggest that the patient has a small-vessel vasculitis. A literature review revealed case reports of a proximal muscle weakness as the presenting symptoms for an ANCA vasculitis. Myopathy can be the initial manifestation of vasculitis and is often unrecognized. Most patients present with proximal predominant weakness with normal CK and elevated aldolase levels. Furthermore, certain medications (Table 1) and malignancies are associated with vasculitis. On review of his medications and past medical history, the patient was recently started on hydralazine, which has been associated with ANCA vasculitis. Further immunoassay testing of the positive ANCA can further help delineate the cause as drug induced vs. idiopathic (Table 2).

### A new two-tier strength assessment approach to the diagnosis of weakness in intensive care: an observational study [^116f8gkH]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Key messages

There is a difference between isometric and through-range techniques for assessing manual muscle strength and the isometric technique is the preferred technique for assessing manual muscle strength (with higher accuracy and reliability).
A cutoff score of 24 out of 36 was identified for the four-point scoring system.
Handgrip dynamometry is a valid and reliable surrogate tool for diagnosing ICU-AW.
Two-tier approach to muscle strength testing is recommended (1) handgrip testing and (2) thorough manual muscle strength testing if below the handgrip cutoff levels.

### Predictive value for weakness and 1-year mortality of screening electrophysiology tests in the ICU [^11161Bnn]. Intensive Care Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

Muscle weakness in long-stay ICU patients contributes to 1-year mortality. Whether electrophysiological screening is an alternative diagnostic tool in unconscious/uncooperative patients remains unknown. We aimed to determine the diagnostic properties of abnormal compound muscle action potential (CMAP), sensory nerve action potential (SNAP), and spontaneous electrical activity (SEA) for Medical Research Council (MRC)-defined weakness and their predictive value for 1-year mortality.

Methods

Data were prospectively collected during the EPaNIC trial (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00512122). First, sensitivity, specificity, positive (PPV) and negative predictive values (NPV) of abnormal CMAP, SNAP, and SEA for weakness were determined. Subsequently, association between 1-year mortality and abnormal findings on electrophysiological screening was assessed by univariate and multivariate analyses correcting for weakness and other risk factors and the prediction model involved only a development phase.

Results

A total of 730 patients were electrophysiologically screened of whom 432 were tested for weakness. On day 8, normal CMAP excluded weakness with a high NPV (80.5%). By day 15, abnormal SNAP and the presence of SEA had a high PPV (91.7 and 80.0%, respectively). Only a reduced CMAP on day 8 was associated with higher 1-year mortality [35.6 vs 15.2% (p < 0.001)]. This association remained significant after correction for weakness and other risk factors [OR 2.463 (95% CI 1.113–5.452), p = 0.026]. Also among conscious/cooperative patients without weakness, reduced CMAP was independently associated with a higher likelihood of death occurring during 1 year [HR 2.818 (95% CI 1.074–7.391), p = 0.035].

Conclusions

The diagnostic properties of electrophysiological screening vary over time. Abnormal CMAP documented early during critical illness carries information about longer-term outcome, which should be further investigated mechanistically.

### Evaluation of the patient with muscle weakness [^111wBuXL]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Muscle weakness is a common complaint among patients presenting to family physicians. Diagnosis begins with a patient history distinguishing weakness from fatigue or asthenia, separate conditions with different etiologies that can coexist with, or be confused for, weakness. The pattern and severity of weakness, associated symptoms, medication use, and family history help the physician determine whether the cause of a patient's weakness is infectious, neurologic, endocrine, inflammatory, rheumatologic, genetic, metabolic, electrolyte-induced, or drug-induced. In the physical examination, the physician should objectively document the patient's loss of strength, conduct a neurologic survey, and search for patterns of weakness and extramuscular involvement. If a specific cause of weakness is suspected, the appropriate laboratory or radiologic studies should be performed. Otherwise, electromyography is indicated to confirm the presence of a myopathy or to evaluate for a neuropathy or a disease of the neuromuscular junction. If the diagnosis remains unclear, the examiner should pursue a tiered progression of laboratory studies. Physicians should begin with blood chemistries and a thyroid-stimulating hormone assay to evaluate for electrolyte and endocrine causes, then progress to creatine kinase level, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and antinuclear antibody assays to evaluate for rheumatologic, inflammatory, genetic, and metabolic causes. Finally, many myopathies require a biopsy for diagnosis. Pathologic evaluation of the muscle tissue specimen focuses on histologic, histochemical, electron microscopic, biochemical, and genetic analyses; advances in technique have made a definitive diagnosis possible for many myopathies.

### How to do it: investigate exertional rhabdomyolysis (or not) [^114yd8g7]. Practical Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Rhabdomyolysis is the combination of symptoms (myalgia, weakness and muscle swelling) and a substantial rise in serum creatine kinase (CK) > 50000 IU/L; there are many causes, but here we specifically address exertional rhabdomyolysis. The consequences of this condition can be severe, including acute kidney injury and requirement for higher level care with organ support. Most patients have 'physiological' exertional rhabdomyolysis with no underlying disease; they do not need investigation and should be advised to return to normal activities in a graded fashion. Rarely, exertional rhabdomyolysis may be the initial presentation of underlying muscle disease, and we review how to identify this much smaller group of patients, who do require investigation.

### Diagnostic odyssey of patients with myotonic dystrophy [^113UJLKo]. Journal of Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

The onset and symptoms of the myotonic dystrophies are diverse, complicating their diagnoses and limiting a comprehensive approach to their clinical care. This report analyzes the diagnostic delay (time from onset of first symptom to diagnosis) in a large sample of myotonic dystrophy (DM) patients enrolled in the US National Registry [679 DM type 1 (DM1) and 135 DM type 2 (DM2) patients]. Age of onset averaged 34.0 ± 14.1 years in DM2 patients compared to 26.1 ± 13.2 years in DM1 (p < 0.0001). The most common initial symptom in DM2 patients was leg weakness (32.6%) compared to grip myotonia in DM1 (38.3%). Pain was reported as the first symptom in 11.1% of DM2 and 3.0% of DM1 patients (p < 0.0001). Reaching the correct diagnosis in DM2 took 14 years on average (double the time compared to DM1) and a significantly higher percentage of patients underwent extended workup including electromyography, muscle biopsies, and finally genetic testing. DM patients who were index cases experienced similar diagnostic delays to non-index cases of DM. Further evaluation of how to shorten these diagnostic delays and limit their impact on burdens of disease, family planning, and symptom management is needed.

### An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline: the diagnosis of intensive care unit-acquired weakness in adults [^112wjLGi]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

American Thoracic Society ICUAW guideline — key outcomes, testing downsides, and evidence review methods are summarized as follows: "Critical beneficial outcomes (i.e., outcomes that alone are sufficient to warrant diagnostic testing) included improved survival or reduced recovery time, with the latter indicated by a shorter duration of mechanical ventilation, reduced length of stay in the ICU or hospital, and/or discharge home rather than to a rehabilitation or long-term care facility". "Less important beneficial outcomes included reduced patient or family anxiety due to incorrect expectations about recovery, more accurate estimates of forthcoming needs for ventilation and rehabilitative services (10, 11, 19), and less unnecessary testing to determine the cause of delayed ventilation liberation or perceived coma (28)". Identified downsides were, "For manual muscle testing (MMT), the burden of performing a more extensive physical examination and the possibility of inconclusive results from patient or practitioner factors were the identified downsides", and "For electrophysiological testing, potential downsides included incorrect prognostic expectations for false-positive results and both unnecessary diagnostic uncertainty and delayed initiation of therapy for false-negative results". The systematic review methods note, "The search strategy shown in Table E2 was initially performed in March of 2009 and then was periodically updated during the development of the guideline", with inclusion criteria: "(1) randomized clinical trial, observational study, or case series (enrolling three or more patients); (2) exclusive enrollment of patients aged 18 years or older; and (3) explicit reporting of diagnostic testing for ICUAW". Recommendation development "was considered based on the balance of beneficial versus adverse outcomes, quality of evidence, burdens, costs, and patient preferences", and "If it was unclear whether a particular course of action was favorable or unfavorable even after weighing these factors collectively, a recommendation was made for further research".

### Respiratory management of patients with neuromuscular weakness: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline and expert panel report [^116cxAeh]. Chest (2023). High credibility.

Study selection, risk of bias, and data analysis — the search for the PICO questions screened 6,761 records and included 108 unique studies, with updates in September 2020 and July 2021 that screened Seven hundred thirty-five and One hundred sixty-three records and included 18 additional studies and two studies, respectively; searches were restricted to English-language publications and not limited by study design or publication date. Screening used independent, duplicate review with disagreement resolution by discussion and forms created in DistillerSR; structured tables were used for data abstraction and second-person review. Because the limited available homogeneous evidence precluded pooling, study findings were described by outcome of interest and presented in evidence tables.

### An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline: the diagnosis of intensive care unit-acquired weakness in adults [^114t247E]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

American Thoracic Society guideline — ICU-acquired weakness (ICUAW) diagnostic testing practices and rationale: Even though evidence that making a diagnosis improves outcomes is very low, many members of the guideline development committee "routinely test high-risk ICU patients for ICUAW (i.e., patients with severe sepsis, difficulty being liberated from mechanical ventilation, or receiving prolonged mechanical ventilation)" and "perform routine diagnostic testing to identify patients with ICUAW". The approach is based on "unsystematic clinical observations" of potential benefits, "including the prevention of unnecessary testing for alternative diagnoses, earlier initiation of physical and occupational therapy, and increased accuracy of counseling" about recovery. Members who test routinely argue the "potential, albeit unproven, benefit of early physical and occupational therapy is sufficient to warrant diagnostic testing", because therapy can be performed "without harm to the patient and with minimal burden to providers". For modality choice, "MMT is performed in cooperative patients and electrophysiological testing in uncooperative patients", and one stated reason for testing is that "ICUAW is associated with worse clinical outcomes".

### A practical guide to assessing functional motor weakness: a review of validated techniques [^115TkwXT]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Functional neurological symptom disorder, specifically, functional limb weakness, is a commonly seen condition in clinical neurological practice and requires careful examination for diagnosis. Specific and detailed examination techniques have been developed and validated over the past 100 years to help clinicians differentiate functional limb weakness from objective neurological weakness. These techniques vary in sensitivity, specificity, clinical application, and limitations. However, over time, the studied and/or validated forms of these exam techniques may have been lost and often not performed or taught in the way it was originally studied, thus decreasing the reliability of the examiner's findings. With many new examination techniques for functional limb weakness having been studied in recent years, it is important to not only review the form of each of these examination techniques, but also discuss the clinical applications, limitations, and utility of each. To date, there has been no comprehensive review demonstrating the exact form of all the studied and/or validated examination techniques for functional limb weakness and their proposed clinical utility. This review analyzes 9 examination techniques for functional limb weakness that have been studied for validity and provides readers with the exact technique of examination used to study each. It also outlines their sensitivity, specificity, clinical applications, and limitations to help clinicians accurately diagnose functional limb weakness.

### Muscle weakness in adults: evaluation and differential diagnosis [^114rs1Wt]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Although the prevalence of muscle weakness in the general population is uncertain, it occurs in about 5% of U.S. adults 60 years and older. Determining the cause of muscle weakness can be challenging. True muscle weakness must first be differentiated from subjective fatigue or pain-related motor impairment with normal motor strength. Muscle weakness should then be graded objectively using a formal tool such as the Medical Research Council Manual Muscle Testing scale. The differential diagnosis of true muscle weakness is extensive, including neurologic, rheumatologic, endocrine, genetic, medication- or toxin-related, and infectious etiologies. A stepwise approach to narrowing this differential diagnosis relies on the history and physical examination combined with knowledge of the potential etiologies. Frailty and sarcopenia are clinical syndromes occurring in older people that can present with generalized weakness. Asymmetric weakness is more common in neurologic conditions, whereas pain is more common in neuropathies or radiculopathies. Identifying abnormal findings, such as Chvostek sign, Babinski reflex, hoarse voice, and muscle atrophy, will narrow the possible diagnoses. Laboratory testing, including electrolyte, thyroid-stimulating hormone, and creatine kinase measurements, may also be helpful. Magnetic resonance imaging is indicated if there is concern for acute neurologic conditions, such as stroke or cauda equina syndrome, and may also guide muscle biopsy. Electromyography is indicated when certain diagnoses are being considered, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, myasthenia gravis, neuropathy, and radiculopathy, and may also guide biopsy. If the etiology remains unclear, specialist consultation or muscle biopsy may be necessary to reach a diagnosis.

### Evaluation of the patient with muscle weakness… [^111LS3gC]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

Physical Examination The physical examination begins with an objective confirmation of the subjective severity and distribution of muscle weakness. In addition to individual muscles, the physician should survey functional activities such as standing and writing to determine whether the weakness is proximal, distal, or both. Next, a thorough neurologic survey should accompany motor testing. The physician should note patterns and relations among defects and narrow the differential by determining whether the deficits are referable to the central or peripheral nervous system. The pattern is important. A neurologic examination that shows deficits in a single nerve or radicular distribution indicates a possible mononeuritis, entrapment neuropathy, or radiculopathy, and calls for a different workup than that required for a limb paresis in a patient with cerebrovascular risk factors.

If the neurologic examination is unrevealing, a more general physical examination, searching for extramuscular signs, is warranted. Pulmonary testing may reveal the crackles of a restrictive lung defect, found in some inflammatory and rheumatologic myopathies. Laboratory and Radiologic Evaluation The sequence and timing of the ancillary investigations varies with the clinical scenario. In a patient whose muscle weakness is suggestive of neurologic disease, early neuroimaging or lumbar puncture is indicated. If infectious disease is suspected, appropriate titers or cultures should be obtained. When a specific class or type of myopathy is suspected, appropriate testing should be performed.

If the cause of muscle weakness is unclear, serum chemistries should be obtained, as well as a thyroid-stimulating hormone assay to evaluate for electrolyte and endocrine myopathies. If an endocrinopathy is suspected, more specific assays can be performed based on clinical suspicion. In addition to CK, an erythrocyte sedimentation rate and an antinuclear antibody assay may help determine if a rheumatologic myopathy exists. If either ESR or ANA assay is positive, additional studies may be obtained, including rheumatoid factor; anti–double-stranded DNA or antiphospholipid antibodies; or anticentromere antibodies.

### Guidance for assessment of the muscle mass phenotypic criterion for the global leadership initiative on malnutrition diagnosis of malnutrition [^116s8MhF]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2022). High credibility.

Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM) phenotypic criterion — muscle function assessment and when to investigate muscle mass: When "low muscle function is detected or becomes apparent in a person of any age or under any clinical circumstances, especially in persons with overweight or obesity, we recommend that skeletal muscle mass should be investigated, and GLIM criteria implemented". Because muscle function "may be adversely impacted by nonnutrition factors and, therefore, should not replace muscle mass assessment in the malnutrition diagnostic process", evaluation of skeletal muscle function "should continue to be included in the assessment of patients at risk or with malnutrition" and is "an integral part of nutrition and functional assessment of patients, even though not required for the diagnosis of malnutrition". Suggested complementary methods include "handgrip test, or knee-extension" and "repeated sit-to-stand or 4-meter walking test".

Give-way weakness/collapsing weakness

The evaluation of give-way weakness is predicated on known neurophysiological properties of muscle power and the inconsistencies of a patient's strength exam with these known properties. In cases of FLW, the examined limb can exhibit abrupt fluctuations in force when resistance is applied. In contrast, ONW will demonstrate sustained resistance without abrupt changes in force.

Technique

Unfortunately, no studies examining give-way weakness have explained the exact technique in which it was or should be tested, however, each study does describe at least one method of testing. These studies describe an examination during which the patient maintains an isometric contraction (a contraction of variable force without a change in muscle length) of the examined upper or lower limb, while the examiner applies progressively more resistance to a specific, isolated muscle group. In patients demonstrating give-way weakness, there is a sudden cessation of isometric contraction, rather than a gradual failure to oppose resistance by the examiner. Given the constant properties of gravity, limbs held up isometrically against gravity may be the most accurate position for evaluation.

For example, when examining unilateral LE weakness, the examiner should first have the patient lie supine and lift their affected LE 1–2 feet off the bed. Positioned at the side of the bed nearest the affected LE, the examiner places their hand on the lifted LE and slowly provides progressively greater resistance downward against the lifted LE.

Interpretation and limitations

The test is considered positive if, at any point during the application of a reasonable amount of limb resistance, the patient's limb exhibits a complete cessation of resistance, such as abrupt falling of the limb to the bed. Give-way weakness is not observed if the limb constantly opposes resistance throughout its range of motion though it may gradually fail to resist the examiner's force. Additionally, give-way weakness can be exhibited in patients that appear to provide full strength during examination, but as the affected limb meets progressively more resistance, it fails to oppose resistance in exhibits a rachet-like manner, exhibiting significant variation in limb strength.

Because give-way weakness is poorly described in terms of proper technique though it report to have a high pooled sensitivity of 97% and a relatively low pooled specificity of only 63%, exam finding should be interpreted with caution as a means of "ruling in" FLW. Additionally, given the exact technique these validation studies used is unclear, it is impossible to attribute their validating results to our clinical findings on exam.

American Thoracic Society intensive care unit–acquired weakness (ICUAW) diagnostic testing — research and value statements include: "We recommend well-designed, adequately powered and executed randomized controlled trials comparing physical rehabilitation or other alternative treatments with usual care in patients with ICUAW that measure and report patient-important outcomes. (strong recommendation, very low-quality evidence)". "We recommend clinical research to determine the role of prior patient disability in the development of and recovery from ICUAW. (strong recommendation, very low-quality evidence)". "We recommend clinical research that determines whether or not patients would want to know if they have ICUAW even though no specific therapy currently exists and how patient preferences influence medical decision making or the perception of prognosis. (strong recommendation, very low-quality evidence)". The remarks state, "The recommendations are strong because the guideline development committee is certain that additional research is necessary to prove whether physical rehabilitation or other interventions improve outcomes in patients with ICUAW, and such evidence is necessary before deciding whether or not routine diagnostic testing for ICUAW is indicated". Values and preferences note, "These recommendations place a higher value on avoiding potentially burdensome diagnostic testing if it will not lead to improved outcomes and a lower value on an uncertain improvement in the rate of discharges home rather than to a rehabilitative facility".

Implementation stance for ICU-acquired weakness — In the absence of clarity, the authors state they are unable to explicitly advocate for a systematic identification approach; instead, ICU clinicians can only leverage evidence for early rehabilitation in broadly defined critically ill patients to prevent or ameliorate disability. They add that this process can and should be revised once more rigorous intervention and diagnostic comparison studies are available, and note that while standard case identification can quantify the problem and focus limited resources, true benefit needs to be proven first.

### Clinical and organizational factors in the initial evaluation of patients with lung cancer: diagnosis and management of lung cancer, 3rd ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^1158E9PB]. Chest (2013). Medium credibility.

Ectopic Cushing syndrome (CS) in small cell lung cancer (SCLC) — epidemiology, clinical features, and Endocrine Society diagnostic approach: Ectopic CS is typically caused by ectopic production of adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) and is commonly associated with bronchial carcinoid and SCLC, is associated with poor prognosis in SCLC, is clinically apparent in 1.6% to 4.5% of SCLCs, and biochemical abnormalities suggestive of ectopic CS may be found in 30% to 50% of SCLCs. Paraneoplastic CS should be suspected in patients with lung cancer if concurrent clinical features are present, including moon facies, acne, purple striae, proximal muscle weakness, peripheral edema, hypertension, and metabolic alkalosis with hypokalemia; although weight gain is common in CS, weight loss occurs in about 10% of CS associated with SCLC. If these features are present, it is important first to exclude iatrogenic CS; the Endocrine Society indicates this strong recommendation is based on high-quality evidence that failure to exclude exogenous glucocorticoid use is associated with unnecessary testing and consequences without benefit. Once iatrogenic disease is excluded, the Endocrine Society clinical practice guidelines recommend initial testing with one of the following: 24-h urinary free cortisol (more than one measurement), late-night salivary cortisol (more than one measurement), or dexamethasone suppression testing (1 mg overnight or 2 mg/d for 2 days); these strong recommendations are based on very-low-quality evidence because data linking specific diagnostic strategies to patient outcomes are limited. If initial testing is normal and the pretest probability is low or moderate, CS is unlikely; if one test is abnormal and if patients have normal test results but a high clinical suspicion of CS, the guidelines recommend further evaluation by an endocrinologist.

### Clinical practice guideline for diagnostic testing for adult obstructive sleep apnea: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^112J4Mu5]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

This guideline establishes clinical practice recommendations for the diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in adults and is intended for use in conjunction with other American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) guidelines on the evaluation and treatment of sleep-disordered breathing in adults.

Methods

The AASM commissioned a task force of experts in sleep medicine. A systematic review was conducted to identify studies, and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) process was used to assess the evidence. The task force developed recommendations and assigned strengths based on the quality of evidence, the balance of benefits and harms, patient values and preferences, and resource use. In addition, the task force adopted foundational recommendations from prior guidelines as "good practice statements", that establish the basis for appropriate and effective diagnosis of OSA. The AASM Board of Directors approved the final recommendations.

Recommendations

The following recommendations are intended as a guide for clinicians diagnosing OSA in adults. Under GRADE, a STRONG recommendation is one that clinicians should follow under most circumstances. A WEAK recommendation reflects a lower degree of certainty regarding the outcome and appropriateness of the patient-care strategy for all patients. The ultimate judgment regarding propriety of any specific care must be made by the clinician in light of the individual circumstances presented by the patient, available diagnostic tools, accessible treatment options, and resources. Good Practice Statements: Diagnostic testing for OSA should be performed in conjunction with a comprehensive sleep evaluation and adequate follow-up. Polysomnography is the standard diagnostic test for the diagnosis of OSA in adult patients in whom there is a concern for OSA based on a comprehensive sleep evaluation. Recommendations: We recommend that clinical tools, questionnaires and prediction algorithms not be used to diagnose OSA in adults, in the absence of polysomnography or home sleep apnea testing. (STRONG). We recommend that polysomnography, or home sleep apnea testing with a technically adequate device, be used for the diagnosis of OSA in uncomplicated adult patients presenting with signs and symptoms that indicate an increased risk of moderate to severe OSA. (STRONG). We recommend that if a single home sleep apnea test is negative, inconclusive, or technically inadequate, polysomnography be performed for the diagnosis of OSA. (STRONG). We recommend that polysomnography, rather than home sleep apnea testing, be used for the diagnosis of OSA in patients with significant cardiorespiratory disease, potential respiratory muscle weakness due to neuromuscular condition, awake hypoventilation or suspicion of sleep related hypoventilation, chronic opioid medication use, history of stroke or severe insomnia. (STRONG). We suggest that, if clinically appropriate, a split-night diagnostic protocol, rather than a full-night diagnostic protocol for polysomnography be used for the diagnosis of OSA. (WEAK). We suggest that when the initial polysomnogram is negative and clinical suspicion for OSA remains, a second polysomnogram be considered for the diagnosis of OSA. (WEAK).

Validating the four-point scoring system for MMT

A cutoff score of 24 out of 36 was identified for the four-point scoring system (Figure 1) using an isometric testing procedure with excellent discriminative ability (area under the ROC curve (95%CI) = 0.92 (0.83 to 1.0) and excellent diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity (95%CI) = 0.84 (0.64 to 0.96); specificity (95%CI) = 1.0 (0.9 to 1.0); positive predictive value (95%CI) = 1.0 (0.84 to 1.0); and negative predictive value (95%CI) = 0.90 (0.76 to 0.98)).

Figure 1
Determining cutoff score for the four-point scoring system from coordinates of the receiver operating curve for highest sensitivity and specificity. The graph on the right is called a receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC curve). It is a plot of the true positive rate (y-axis) against the false positive rate (x-axis) for the different possible cut-points of a diagnostic test. The closer the curve is to the left-hand border and top border of the ROC space the more accurate the test. Accuracy is measured by the area under the curve. An area of 1 = perfect test; an area of 0.5 = inadequate test. The ROC curve analysis resulted in an area under the curve of 0.92 (95%CI 0.83 to 1.0), which is almost perfect and demonstrates excellent diagnostic accuracy. The table on the left outlines each individual plotted cut-point. At 23.5 the sensitivity was 0.84, with specificity of 1.0, and at 25 the sensitivity was 0.96, and specificity was 0.86. A cutoff point of 24 would therefore result in high sensitivity and specificity. 95%CI, ninety-five percent confidence interval.

### Diagnosis of Pompe disease: muscle biopsy vs blood-based assays [^111qm6cr]. JAMA Neurology (2013). Medium credibility.

The diagnosis of Pompe disease (acid maltase deficiency, glycogen storage disease type II) in children and adults can be challenging because of the heterogeneous clinical presentation and considerable overlap of signs and symptoms found in other neuromuscular diseases. This review evaluates some of the methods used in the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of late-onset Pompe disease. Muscle biopsy is commonly used as an early diagnostic tool in the evaluation of muscle disease. However, experience has shown that relying solely on visualizing a periodic acid-Schiff-positive vacuolar myopathy to identify late-onset Pompe disease often leads to false-negative results and subsequent delays in identification and treatment of the disorder. Serum creatine kinase level can be normal or only mildly elevated in late-onset Pompe disease and is not very helpful alone to suggest the diagnosis, but in combination with proximal and axial weakness it may raise the suspicion for Pompe disease. A simple blood-based assay to measure the level of α-glucosidase activity is the optimal initial test for confirming or excluding Pompe disease. A timely and accurate diagnosis of late-onset Pompe disease likely will improve patient outcomes as care standards including enzyme replacement therapy can be applied and complications can be anticipated. Increased awareness of the clinical phenotype of Pompe disease is therefore warranted to expedite diagnostic screening for this condition with blood-based enzymatic assays.

### The diagnostic journey of patients being investigated for myopathy in a tertiary centre in england [^114FQaLW]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

What is clear is that a better diagnostic pathway is needed for this cohort of patients. The data indicate that a means of improving both the recognition of patients requiring specialist centre input (to reduce the time from symptom onset to hospital review) and a more streamlined diagnostic approach once in secondary/tertiary care (to reduce the time to diagnosis once in the specialist system) are required. Regarding the latter, pathways comprising initial tests that can effectively identify both myopathy and non-myopathy diagnoses appear to be of value. These can then, where necessary, inform further testing and help patients get to their underlying diagnosis as efficiently as possible. In muscle disease, this is particularly important if therapeutic developments are going to be leveraged effectively. Our analysis suggests that a combination of CK, EMG and MRI neuroaxis has a high chance of moving forward towards both myopathy and non-myopathy diagnoses. By contrast, tests that only diagnose one side of the myopathy/not myopathy conundrum may fair less well, e.g. CK and biopsy (myopathy only) had the lowest percentage success rate (Table 4). Whether test combinations were done together, or sequentially, would depend upon the clinical and healthcare context and, of course, be for the clinician to decide. However, our data indicate that both myopathy and non-myopathy patients suffer diagnostic delay and thus early consideration of how to investigate both types of diagnosis may need to be given early consideration if timelines are to be reduced.

There are limitations to our investigation. As a single-centre study, the applicability of the findings to other centres and healthcare systems is uncertain. However, as noted above, the duration of symptoms, diagnostic performance of investigations, conditions encountered and time to diagnosis are similar to prior reports from a range of countries. There are no previous reports on large cohorts of patients in other healthcare systems, so perhaps our findings will stimulate others to look at their own diagnostic pathways. In doing so, the international neuromuscular community would be able to learn from systems that appear to provide a faster diagnostic approach, or reconsider how neuromuscular training is delivered in order to improve things for the future. Either way, our attempt to draw attention to the diagnostic odyssey of patients being investigated for myopathy has implications for the those working in neuromuscular neurology.

### Advances in the diagnosis of neuromuscular junction disorders [^117GLyBw]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2005). Low credibility.

Disorders of the neuromuscular junction have a wide range of clinical presentations, which frequently poses a diagnostic challenge to evaluating clinicians. This article describes the tests used in the diagnosis of diseases of the neuromuscular junction, reviews the evidence supporting the use of each test, and proposes guidelines for their efficient utilization. A focused review of the literature was employed. Reports from four main categories of diagnostic tests (pharmacologic, electrodiagnostic, immunologic, and miscellaneous tests) were reviewed, and the sensitivity and specificity of each test in the diagnosis of specific neuromuscular junction diseases were examined. The clinical presentation determines which diagnostic tests should be utilized in individual cases of suspected neuromuscular junction disease. However, knowledge of the sensitivity and specificity of each test can help to focus the diagnostic evaluation and maximize the diagnostic yield of each test.

### Motor delays: early identification and evaluation [^117LXUFK]. Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Pediatricians often encounter children with delays of motor development in their clinical practices. Earlier identification of motor delays allows for timely referral for developmental interventions as well as diagnostic evaluations and treatment planning. A multidisciplinary expert panel developed an algorithm for the surveillance and screening of children for motor delays within the medical home, offering guidance for the initial workup and referral of the child with possible delays in motor development. Highlights of this clinical report include suggestions for formal developmental screening at the 9-, 18-, 30-, and 48-month well-child visits; approaches to the neurologic examination, with emphasis on the assessment of muscle tone; and initial diagnostic approaches for medical home providers. Use of diagnostic tests to evaluate children with motor delays are described, including brain MRI for children with high muscle tone, and measuring serum creatine kinase concentration of those with decreased muscle tone. The importance of pursuing diagnostic tests while concurrently referring patients to early intervention programs is emphasized.

### Orthopnea secondary to brachial plexitis with bilateral diaphragmatic paralysis [^111tdQbo]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic evaluation of suspected diaphragm paralysis starts with a comprehensive history and physical examination. After inquiring about positional dyspnea, further evaluation should include asking about the history of childhood poliomyelitis, infections including Lyme, syphilis, and infection with human immunodeficiency viruses, remote history of neck or cardiothoracic surgery or trauma, history of associated neurological symptoms such as muscle weakness or numbness. The physical examination can be misleading; however, specific findings can help support potential causes. Upper extremities weakness or numbness in cases of brachial plexus or cervical spine pathology, lymphadenopathy in cases of underlying occult tumors, and scars of previous surgeries. The principal causes of diaphragmatic weakness are further mentioned in Table 2.

Table 2
Principal causes of diaphragmatic paralysis

A chest radiograph showing elevated hemidiaphragm is sensitive but not specific for unilateral diaphragmatic paralysis and can be pseudo-normal in case of bilateral paralysis. In our patient, the chest radiograph did not display any elevated hemi-diaphragm or small lung volumes. The fluoroscopic sniff test is easy to perform and is the initial test of choice to diagnose diaphragmatic weakness. In cases of unilateral diaphragm paralysis, the sniff test is positive (absence of downward movement of the diaphragm) in over 90% of the cases. In bilateral paralysis, however, the sniff test may be falsely negative. This happens because the accessory inspiratory muscles result in the upward movement of the ribs, resulting in the false appearance of the downward movement of the diaphragm. Spirometry findings may also be misleading. If respiratory muscle weakness is suspected, including maximal voluntary ventilation, maximal respiratory pressures, and supine-forced vital capacity should be ordered. The respiratory muscles' contribution to tidal breathing varies depending on the body position. In an erect position, the intercostals can contribute around 30% to the tidal breath; however, their impact becomes significantly diminished in a supine position, and the diaphragm's contribution goes over 90%. In a study of 50 individuals with normal lung function, a delta FVC (difference between erect and supine) ≥ 25% in patients was an indicator of possible underlying diaphragm dysfunction. In another study, a decrease in vital capacity ≥ 30% in the supine posture, compared to an erect posture, indicated bilateral diaphragm weakness. In our patient, the positional drop in the FVC is secondary to absent bilateral phrenic nerve responses as per the nerve conduction study leading to bilateral diaphragmatic paralysis.

### Expert perspective: diagnostic approach to differentiating juvenile dermatomyositis from muscular dystrophy [^116EJdx5]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

In JDM, family history of autoimmune disease is variable, but it can be supportive of a diagnosis if present. Family history of MD is supportive, but de novo mutations do occur (for example, one‐third of DMD is from de novo variants), so a lack of family history does not rule out MD.

Physical and musculoskeletal examination

The physical examination is a critical part of clinical assessment in a child with reported muscle weakness to establish the (1) presence, severity, and pattern of weakness and (2) presence of other organ involvement and/or inflammation, such as in the skin or lungs, which might aid in the differential diagnosis. The initial musculoskeletal evaluation should include an assessment of strength, range of motion, joint mobility, gait, flexibility, balance, and functional mobility (ie, skipping, jumping, and squatting). In JDM, initial muscle weakness appears in the quadriceps, biceps, neck flexor, and abdominal muscles. Joint range of motion can be limited secondary to both muscle and joint inflammation; this is more frequently observed in the elbows, wrists, fingers, knees, and ankles. Patients with JDM typically present with functional mobility deficits, including difficulty with tasks such as supine to sit, sit to stand, reaching overhead, lifting head from supine, and stair negotiation.

Standardized muscle assessments have been tested and validated in the evaluation of muscle disease for JDM and should be performed whenever possible. We standardly perform Manual Muscle Testing (MMT‐8) and the Childhood Myositis Assessment Scale (CMAS) at initial evaluation and then follow the scores over time to assess response to therapy and guide changes in treatment plan. The MMT‐8 evaluates a set of eight muscles tested unilaterally or bilaterally in addition to axial (neck flexor) testing (the highest score is 80 [unilateral] or 150 [bilateral]). Our case report patient's MMT‐8 score at diagnosis was 95 of 150. The CMAS is a 14‐item observational, performance‐based instrument with a maximum total score of 52 that was developed to evaluate muscle strength, physical function, and endurance and has been validated for those aged 4–18 years.

### A practical guide to assessing functional motor weakness: a review of validated techniques [^1135Wzgi]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

There are several validated examination techniques that can be used to distinguish FLW from ONW. Here, we have reviewed not only the exact validated exam maneuvers, but also provided guidance on how clinicians should interpret their exam findings given these results. Though many techniques have been reliably validated, some remain unclear in terms of the exact technique that should be used. By examining weakness using the techniques described in these validation studies, as well as utilizing multiple underlying principles of motor reflex and strength, clinicians may be able to reduce diagnostic uncertainty, and, in turn, improve the care of their patients.

### Acute neuromuscular weakness in the intensive care unit [^116FEyRc]. Critical Care Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Introduction

Patients in the intensive care unit develop generalized weakness due to a number of factors. Neuromuscular weakness is a common cause of failure to wean from the ventilator and decreased limb movements. A rational approach to evaluation of weakness will help to identify most of the common causes of neuromuscular weakness in the intensive care unit.

Aims

This review provides an analysis of neuromuscular weakness and a practical algorithm to assist in diagnostic evaluation.

Conclusions

The most common acquired causes of weakness in the critically ill patient in the intensive care unit are critical illness polyneuropathy and critical illness myopathy. In the intensive care unit setting, electrophysiological studies, biopsies, and imaging studies are often necessary to complement the clinical impression.

### Guidelines for genetic testing of muscle and neuromuscular junction disorders [^113DzCAY]. Muscle & Nerve (2021). Medium credibility.

Despite recent advances in the understanding of inherited muscle and neuromuscular junction diseases, as well as the advent of a wide range of genetic tests, patients continue to face delays in diagnosis of sometimes treatable disorders. These guidelines outline an approach to genetic testing in such disorders. Initially, a patient's phenotype is evaluated to identify myopathies requiring directed testing, including myotonic dystrophies, facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy, oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy, mitochondrial myopathies, dystrophinopathies, and oculopharyngodistal myopathy. Initial investigation in the remaining patients is generally a comprehensive gene panel by next-generation sequencing. Broad panels have a higher diagnostic yield and can be cost-effective. Due to extensive phenotypic overlap and treatment implications, genes responsible for congenital myasthenic syndromes should be included when evaluating myopathy patients. For patients whose initial genetic testing is negative or inconclusive, phenotypic re-evaluation is warranted, along with consideration of genes and variants not included initially, as well as their acquired mimickers.

### Weakness and elevated creatinine kinase as the initial presentation of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [^1163SH7q]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

COVID-19 is a global public health emergency with more than one million positive cases across the globe. COVID-19 has a multifaceted presentation. We are herein to report two cases of SARS-CoV-2 induced rhabdomyolysis with an initial presentation of weakness and elevated creatinine kinase (CK). Both patients had no respiratory symptoms, they only complained of generalized weakness and were found to have elevated CK. Routine chest X-ray showed bilateral infiltrates in both cases and subsequently reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 was positive. To the best of our knowledge, there was only one literature to date documented SARS-CoV-2 induced rhabdomyolysis as a late complication of COVID-19 patient. Our cases showed that elevated CK and rhabdomyolysis can be the sole initial presentation of patients with COVID-19 and total CK should be ordered in every patient on admission.

### An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline: the diagnosis of intensive care unit-acquired weakness in adults [^112sbRPx]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Rationale

Profound muscle weakness during and after critical illness is termed intensive care unit-acquired weakness (ICUAW).

Objectives

To develop diagnostic recommendations for ICUAW.

Methods

A multidisciplinary expert committee generated diagnostic questions. A systematic review was performed, and recommendations were developed using the Grading, Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.

Measurement and Main Results

Severe sepsis, difficult ventilator liberation, and prolonged mechanical ventilation are associated with ICUAW. Physical rehabilitation improves outcomes in heterogeneous populations of ICU patients. Because it may not be feasible to provide universal physical rehabilitation, an alternative approach is to identify patients most likely to benefit. Patients with ICUAW may be such a group. Our review identified only one case series of patients with ICUAW who received physical therapy. When compared with a case series of patients with ICUAW who did not receive structured physical therapy, evidence suggested those who receive physical rehabilitation were more frequently discharged home rather than to a rehabilitative facility, although confidence intervals included no difference. Other interventions show promise, but fewer data proving patient benefit existed, thus precluding specific comment. Additionally, prior comorbidity was insufficiently defined to determine its influence on outcome, treatment response, or patient preferences for diagnostic efforts. We recommend controlled clinical trials in patients with ICUAW that compare physical rehabilitation with usual care and further research in understanding risk and patient preferences.

Conclusions

Research that identifies treatments that benefit patients with ICUAW is necessary to determine whether the benefits of diagnostic testing for ICUAW outweigh its burdens.

3.1 Literature Search and Assessment for Eligibility

The literature search results are summarized in a PRISMA flowchart in Figure 1. After removing duplicates, we screened for eligibility, which included 1996 titles and abstracts and 76 full texts. The main reasons for exclusion were as follows: only abstracts were available (primarily conference abstracts), differing aims, including laboratory manuals or statistical methods for measuring CK, opinion papers, or insufficient information on the population studied or measurements inconsistent with our scope (children only, non‐healthy participants, assessment of CK after exercise). Ultimately, 20 papers were considered eligible for inclusion in our review. No additional studies were identified from the references of the included documents or the updated search conducted after finalizing the manuscript.

American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) guideline — recommendations for diagnosing obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in adults — include the following. We recommend that clinical tools, questionnaires and prediction algorithms not be used to diagnose OSA in adults, in the absence of polysomnography or home sleep apnea testing. (STRONG) We recommend that polysomnography, or home sleep apnea testing with a technically adequate device, be used for the diagnosis of OSA in uncomplicated adult patients presenting with signs and symptoms that indicate an increased risk of moderate to severe OSA. (STRONG) We recommend that if a single home sleep apnea test is negative, inconclusive, or technically inadequate, polysomnography be performed for the diagnosis of OSA. (STRONG) We recommend that polysomnography, rather than home sleep apnea testing, be used for the diagnosis of OSA in patients with significant cardiorespiratory disease, potential respiratory muscle weakness due to neuromuscular condition, awake hypoventilation or suspicion of sleep related hypoventilation, chronic opioid medication use, history of stroke or severe insomnia. (STRONG) We suggest that, if clinically appropriate, a split-night diagnostic protocol, rather than a full-night diagnostic protocol for polysomnography be used for the diagnosis of OSA. (WEAK) We suggest that when the initial polysomnogram is negative and clinical suspicion for OSA remains, a second polysomnogram be considered for the diagnosis of OSA. (WEAK)

### A new two-tier strength assessment approach to the diagnosis of weakness in intensive care: an observational study [^111gASJX]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Intensive care unit-acquired weakness (ICU-AW) is a significant and prevalent problem for individuals who survive the initial insult of a critical illness. Timely and accurate diagnosis is important in order for clinicians to target rehabilitation resources and select appropriate exercise modalities to minimise further muscle wasting. It is important that muscle strength testing for diagnosis is reliable, valid and easily performed by different members of the multidisciplinary team.

Manual muscle testing (MMT) using the six-point Medical Research Council sum score (MRC-SS) is currently the recommended method for diagnosing ICU-AW. There is criticism within the literature of this scoring system, particularly in its ability to discriminate between strength categories at the upper end of the scale (for example, between Grades 4 to 5 on the Oxford grading system). Whilst there is high inter-rater reliability for MRC-SS, the agreement levels reported for diagnosing ICU-AW have varied from poor to good in previous studies. Worldwide there is variability in the testing technique utilised by clinicians, as strength testing can be assessed either isometrically (at one point in the range) or whilst moving through a joint's range of motion.

Recently, a modified four-point scoring system with a transformed maximum sum score of 36 was developed in an attempt to improve the MRC grading system accuracy and to restore the ordered threshold requirements for ordinal categories. This four-point scale was derived from the original six-point scoring system for muscle strength testing. The validity of this new scoring system has not been established in the intensive care unit (ICU) setting.

Thorough MMT requires clinicians to be adequately trained in the assessment procedures and it can take up to 30 minutes to test six muscle groups bilaterally. To reduce the time taken for assessment, handgrip dynamometry (HGD) has been recommended as a simple and easy surrogate measure for diagnosing ICU-AW. Ali and colleagues developed cutoff scores for HGD based on gender (for males < 11 kilograms (kg) and for females < 7 kg is considered to be indicative of ICU-AW). However, uptake of HGD as a diagnostic assessment tool in clinical practice has been inconsistent with no published external validation of these previously developed cutoff scores.

### The diagnostic value of the short physical performance battery for sarcopenia [^11688aQi]. BMC Geriatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Highly sensitive tests have been proposed as ideal tools for screening purposes, allowing for the early identification and initiation of treatment. Meanwhile, high specificity has been reported as the key diagnostic factor for a disease, with a combination of high sensitivity/low specificity and low sensitivity/high specificity test an ideal method to address false positives. Using this model, the SPPB displays high sensitivity and represents the ideal screening tool for sarcopenia. Alternately, the SARC-F tool has consistently shown high specificity in numerous studies and may therefore facilitate the diagnostic process. This combined approach represents an area for further research given the potential to enhance clinical care.

Sarcopenia in its current form includes the assessment of muscle strength, mass, and physical performance. However, whilst measures of strength and physical performance have shown links to adverse outcomes of sarcopenia, the same relationship is not observed with ALM. Our findings corroborate previous studies which have shown the disconnect between measures of muscle strength and physical performance and muscle mass. This is represented by the poor to acceptable AUC when using the SPPB as an independent diagnostic tool. However, a combination of SPPB with ALM/h 2 resulted in increased AUC, matching well with both initial and revised EWGSOP sarcopenia criteria, with the highest diagnostic value evident using the sit to stand test combined with ALM/h 2 and either gait speed or SPPB. This was somewhat expected given both the sit to stand test and gait speed are already components of the SPPB. However, it was surprising to observe that the combination of SPPB and ALM/h 2 yielded an increased AUC for all the other diagnostic criteria proposed by EWGSOP2. Given the SPPB is a tool which can be easily implemented into the routine care of patients without a need for specialized equipment, this finding may provide useful in clinical practice.
