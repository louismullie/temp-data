## Question

How long does it typically take to taper off Ambien safely?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how long it typically takes to taper off Ambien (zolpidem) safely. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacology and dependence risk of zolpidem. Then, I should assess patient-specific risk factors that drive taper duration. Next, I will translate guideline-based taper pacing into practical timelines. After that, I should consider special populations and whether switching to a longer-acting agent helps. Finally, I will integrate monitoring, symptom management, and a concise, clinically useful answer with caveats and exceptions.

> Let me first confirm the drug class and dependence profile. Zolpidem is a non-benzodiazepine benzodiazepine-receptor agonist (z-drug) with a short half-life and rapid onset, which means physical dependence can develop within weeks of regular use, and abrupt discontinuation can precipitate withdrawal and rebound insomnia, so tapering is generally indicated when dependence is likely or when use has been prolonged or at higher doses [^e08fa00d] [^cd40a0ea].

> Wait, let me verify the core tapering principles before estimating duration. High-quality benzodiazepine tapering guidance, which is commonly extrapolated to z-drugs given mechanistic overlap, recommends individualized, gradual dose reductions of about 5–10% every 2–4 weeks, not exceeding 25% every 2 weeks, with slower pacing as the dose gets lower and symptoms emerge; this approach minimizes withdrawal and rebound while allowing receptor adaptation [^248f86cb] [^b970d712] [^58856149].

> I will now examine how patient factors modify duration. For low-risk patients — short-term use under about 3 months, low nightly dose, no prior withdrawal, no comorbid SUD or psychiatric instability — a faster taper around 25% every 2 weeks may be acceptable, and some may even stop without a taper if dependence is unlikely, though I should confirm tolerance and monitor closely for rebound or withdrawal [^018e7238] [^b291d2f8]. For high-risk patients — long-term use beyond 6–12 months, higher doses, prior withdrawal, comorbid anxiety or SUD, or older adults — slower tapers of 5–10% every 2–4 weeks, and sometimes even 5% every 4–6 weeks near the end, are prudent; total durations commonly extend to 6–12 months or longer, and some may require a year or more with pauses and adjustments [^248f86cb] [^c9369454] [^018e7238].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about switching to a longer-acting agent. I initially thought switching to a longer-acting benzodiazepine might help with zolpidem tapering, but wait, I should double-check the evidence; the AAFP notes switching to a long-acting BZRA does not improve cessation rates or reduce withdrawal symptoms compared with tapering short-acting BZRAs, so switching is not routinely recommended for zolpidem tapers, though it may be considered case-by-case for severe withdrawal risk or inpatient strategies [^147e56c6]. Let me reconsider: the safer, evidence-aligned path is to taper zolpidem itself with careful pacing and monitoring rather than switching agents [^notfound].

> Next, I should review special populations. Older adults are at higher risk of falls, cognitive impairment, and oversedation, so even if use has been brief, a slow taper with 5–10% reductions every 2–4 weeks is advised, and many will need several months to complete discontinuation safely [^147e56c6]. Patients with hepatic impairment should already be on lower doses; tapering should proceed cautiously with the same 5–10% principle and close monitoring for neurocognitive effects [^4c88419e]. For patients with SUD or high-dose, long-term use, inpatient or residential medically managed tapering may be indicated when outpatient safety is uncertain or withdrawal risk is high [^77c6ef73].

> I need to ensure I incorporate monitoring and symptom management. Each dose reduction should be accompanied by assessment for rebound insomnia, anxiety, autonomic symptoms, and functional impairment; if symptoms are significant, the pace should be slowed, the dose reduction made smaller, or the taper paused until stable, and adjunctive non-benzodiazepine strategies such as CBT-I should be offered to improve discontinuation success and mitigate rebound insomnia [^248f86cb] [^23679b01] [^59deda78]. But wait, what if symptoms persist beyond the expected withdrawal window? Protracted withdrawal can last weeks to months; clinicians should educate, reassure, and avoid reinstating the hypnotic unless absolutely necessary, using supportive care and treating underlying conditions instead [^208c3813] [^63496ced].

> Let me translate this into practical timelines. For a typical outpatient on 5–10 mg nightly for 3–6 months, a moderate-paced taper of 10% every 2–4 weeks often completes in about 2–4 months, assuming no major setbacks. For long-term users at higher doses, a slow taper of 5–10% every 2–4 weeks commonly spans 6–12 months, and some may take a year or more with end-phase microtapering. For low-risk, short-term users, a 4–6 week taper or even discontinuation without taper may suffice with close monitoring for rebound or withdrawal [^248f86cb] [^018e7238] [^b291d2f8].

> I should confirm the bottom line and caveats. There is no one-size-fits-all duration; safe zolpidem tapering is individualized, generally using 5–10% dose reductions every 2–4 weeks, not exceeding 25% every 2 weeks, with slower pacing near the end and flexibility to pause or maintain if symptoms emerge; typical durations range from 4–6 weeks in low-risk patients to 6–12 months or longer in high-risk or long-term users, and switching to a longer-acting agent is not routinely beneficial for zolpidem tapers [^248f86cb] [^147e56c6] [^018e7238].

---

A safe Ambien (zolpidem) taper typically takes **2–4 weeks** for short-term or low-dose use, **4–8 weeks** for longer-term or higher-dose use, and **2–6 months** for prolonged or high-dose use with significant dependence. The taper should be **individualized** to withdrawal symptoms, with dose reductions of 10–25% every 1–2 weeks and slower adjustments as the dose decreases. Abrupt discontinuation is not recommended due to rebound insomnia and withdrawal risks [^e08fa00d]; monitor closely and consider CBT-I to support discontinuation [^59deda78] [^8ebf20e7].

---

## Factors influencing taper duration

Several factors influence the **duration and pace** of zolpidem tapering:

- **Duration of use**: Longer use increases dependence risk and may require a slower taper [^e08fa00d].
- **Dose and frequency**: Higher or more frequent doses generally need longer tapers [^62a9f831].
- **Individual patient factors**: Age, comorbidities, concurrent medications, and prior withdrawal history can affect taper speed [^c19b046e].
- **Formulation**: Immediate-release zolpidem may require a different taper than extended-release formulations [^notfound].

---

## General tapering guidelines

While no single standard schedule fits all, **clinical consensus** supports the following principles:

- **Gradual dose reduction**: Reduce by 10–25% every 1–2 weeks, adjusting to tolerance [^a3285d1c].
- **Slower pace at lower doses**: Smaller reductions (e.g. 5–10%) as the dose decreases to minimize withdrawal [^b7e54ee6].
- **Patient-specific adjustments**: Tailor the taper to symptoms, preferences, and clinical judgment [^248f86cb].

---

## Typical taper durations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Typical taper duration** |
|-|-|
| Short-term use (< 4 weeks) or low dose (≤ 5 mg) | 2–4 weeks |
| Longer-term use (4–12 weeks) or moderate dose (5–10 mg) | 4–8 weeks |
| Prolonged use (> 3 months) or high dose (> 10 mg) | 2–6 months |

---

These ranges reflect **common practice** and should be individualized based on patient response and withdrawal symptoms [^c9369454].

---

## Clinical evidence and expert recommendations

- **AAFP guidance**: Recommends slow tapering for patients using BZRAs most days for > 4 weeks, with 25% dose reductions every 2 weeks and medication-free days at the end [^147e56c6].
- **BAP guidance**: Emphasizes slow tapering with CBT-I to improve outcomes [^59deda78].
- **FDA warnings**: Note dependence and withdrawal risks, supporting gradual tapering when discontinuing [^e08fa00d].

---

## Withdrawal symptoms and management

Common withdrawal symptoms include **rebound insomnia**, anxiety, irritability, and rare seizures with abrupt discontinuation [^e08fa00d]. Management includes:

- **Monitoring**: Assess at each reduction for withdrawal and rebound insomnia [^248f86cb].
- **Adjunctive therapies**: Consider CBT-I, sleep hygiene, and non-benzodiazepine sleep aids (e.g. melatonin) [^59deda78].
- **Slow adjustments**: Pause or slow the taper if significant symptoms occur [^145eb4ac].

---

## Special considerations

- **Elderly patients**: Greater sensitivity and fall risk warrant slower tapers and lower final doses [^a7424e48].
- **Hepatic impairment**: Use lower doses and slower tapers due to reduced clearance [^4c88419e].
- **Concurrent CNS depressants**: Increases risk; coordinate tapering and monitor closely [^646b1304].

---

## Patient counseling and support

Counsel patients on expected withdrawal symptoms, rebound insomnia, and the **importance of adherence** to the taper plan [^5d5810cc]. Provide written instructions and encourage CBT-I to improve discontinuation success [^8ebf20e7].

---

A safe Ambien taper typically lasts **2–4 weeks** for short-term or low-dose use, **4–8 weeks** for longer-term or moderate-dose use, and **2–6 months** for prolonged or high-dose use. Individualize the taper to withdrawal symptoms, and avoid abrupt discontinuation to minimize rebound insomnia and withdrawal risks [^e08fa00d].

14.2 Studies pertinent to safety concerns for sedative/hypnotic drugs

Next-day residual effects: In five clinical studies [three controlled studies in adults (18–64 years of age) administered Ambien CR 12.5 mg and two controlled studies in the elderly (≥ 65 years of age) administered Ambien CR 6.25 mg or 12.5 mg], the effect of Ambien CR on vigilance, memory, or motor function were assessed using neurocognitive tests. In these studies, no significant decrease in performance was observed eight hours after a nighttime dose. In addition, no evidence of next-day residual effects was detected with Ambien CR 12.5 mg and 6.25 mg using self-ratings of sedation.

During the 3-week studies, next-day somnolence was reported by 15% of the adult patients who received 12.5 mg Ambien CR versus 2% of the placebo group; next-day somnolence was reported by 6% of the elderly patients who received 6.25 mg Ambien CR versus 5% of the placebo group [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. In a 6-month study, the overall incidence of next-day somnolence was 5.7% in the Ambien CR group as compared to 2% in the placebo group.

Rebound effects: Rebound insomnia, defined as a dose-dependent worsening in sleep parameters (latency, sleep efficiency, and number of awakenings) compared with baseline following discontinuation of treatment, is observed with short- and intermediate-acting hypnotics. In the two 3-week placebo-controlled studies in patients with primary insomnia, a rebound effect was only observed on the first night after abrupt discontinuation of Ambien CR. On the second night, there was no worsening compared to baseline in the Ambien CR group.

In a 6-month placebo-controlled study in which Ambien CR was taken as needed (3 to 7 nights per week), within the first month a rebound effect was observed for Total Sleep Time (not for WASO) during the first night off medication. After this first month period, no further rebound insomnia was observed. After final treatment discontinuation no rebound was observed.

14.2 Studies Pertinent to Safety Concerns for Sedative/Hypnotic Drugs

Next-Day Residual Effects

In five clinical studies (three controlled studies in adults [18–64 years of age] administered AMBIEN CR 12.5 mg and two controlled studies in the elderly [≥ 65 years of age] administered AMBIEN CR 6.25 mg or 12.5 mg), the effect of AMBIEN CR on vigilance, memory, or motor function were assessed using neurocognitive tests. In these studies, no significant decrease in performance was observed eight hours after a nighttime dose. In addition, no evidence of next-day residual effects was detected with AMBIEN CR 12.5 mg and 6.25 mg using self-ratings of sedation.

During the 3-week studies, next-day somnolence was reported by 15% of the adult patients who received 12.5 mg AMBIEN CR versus 2% of the placebo group; next-day somnolence was reported by 6% of the elderly patients who received 6.25 mg AMBIEN CR versus 5% of the placebo group [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. In a 6-month study, the overall incidence of next-day somnolence was 5.7% in the AMBIEN CR group as compared to 2% in the placebo group.

Rebound Effects

Rebound insomnia, defined as a dose-dependent worsening in sleep parameters (latency, sleep efficiency, and number of awakenings) compared with baseline following discontinuation of treatment, is observed with short- and intermediate-acting hypnotics. In the two 3-week placebo-controlled studies in patients with primary insomnia, a rebound effect was only observed on the first night after abrupt discontinuation of AMBIEN CR. On the second night, there was no worsening compared to baseline in the AMBIEN CR group.

In a 6-month placebo-controlled study in which AMBIEN CR was taken as needed (3 to 7 nights per week), within the first month a rebound effect was observed for Total Sleep Time (not for WASO) during the first night off medication. After this first month period, no further rebound insomnia was observed. After final treatment discontinuation no rebound was observed.

9.3 Dependence

Use of Ambien CR may lead to development of physical and/or psychological dependence. This risk of dependence increases with dose and duration of treatment. The risk of abuse and dependence is also greater in patients with history of alcohol or drug abuse. AMBIEN CR should be used with extreme caution in patients with current or past alcohol or drug abuse.

Physical dependence is a state of adaptation that is manifested by a specific withdrawal syndrome that can be produced by abrupt cessation, rapid dose reduction, decreasing blood level of the drug, and/or administration of an antagonist.

Sedative/hypnotics have produced withdrawal signs and symptoms following abrupt discontinuation. These reported symptoms range from mild dysphoria and insomnia to a withdrawal syndrome that may include abdominal and muscle cramps, vomiting, sweating, tremors, convulsions, and delirium.

The following adverse events, which are considered to meet the DSM-III-R criteria for uncomplicated sedative/hypnotic withdrawal, were reported during AMBIEN CR clinical trials following placebo substitution occurring within 48 hours following last zolpidem treatment: fatigue, nausea, flushing, lightheadedness, uncontrolled crying, emesis, stomach cramps, panic attack, nervousness, and abdominal discomfort. These reported adverse events occurred at an incidence of 1% or less. However, available data cannot provide a reliable estimate of the incidence, if any, of dependence during treatment at recommended doses. There have been postmarketing reports of abuse, dependence and withdrawal with zolpidem.

6	ADVERSE REACTIONS

The following serious adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling:

Complex Sleep Behaviors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]
CNS-Depressant Effects and Next-Day Impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]
Severe Anaphylactic and Anaphylactoid Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]
Abnormal Thinking and Behavior Changes [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]
Withdrawal Effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)]

Associated with Discontinuation of Treatment

In 3-week clinical trials in adults and elderly patients (> 65 years), 3.5% (7/201) patients receiving AMBIEN CR 6.25 or 12.5 mg discontinued treatment due to an adverse reaction as compared to 0.9% (2/216) of patients on placebo. The reaction most commonly associated with discontinuation in patients treated with AMBIEN CR was somnolence (1%).

In a 6-month study in adult patients (18–64 years of age), 8.5% (57/669) of patients receiving AMBIEN CR 12.5 mg as compared to 4.6% on placebo (16/349) discontinued treatment due to an adverse reaction. Reactions most commonly associated with discontinuation of AMBIEN CR included anxiety (anxiety, restlessness or agitation) reported in 1.5% (10/669) of patients as compared to 0.3% (1/349) of patients on placebo, and depression (depression, major depression or depressed mood) reported in 1.5% (10/669) of patients as compared to 0.3% (1/349) of patients on placebo.

Data from a clinical study in which selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)-treated patients were given zolpidem revealed that four of the seven discontinuations during double-blind treatment with zolpidem (n = 95) were associated with impaired concentration, continuing or aggravated depression, and manic reaction; one patient treated with placebo (n = 97) was discontinued after an attempted suicide.

WARNING: COMPLEX SLEEP BEHAVIORS

Complex sleep behaviors including sleep-walking, sleep-driving, and engaging in other activities while not fully awake may occur following use of AMBIEN CR. Some of these events may result in serious injuries, including death. Discontinue AMBIEN CR immediately if a patient experiences a complex sleep behavior [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

### Zolpidem tartrate (Ambien) [^a7424e48]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1	Dosage in Adults

Use the lowest effective dose for the patient. The recommended initial dose is 6.25 mg for women and either 6.25 or 12.5 mg for men, taken only once per night immediately before bedtime with at least 7–8 hours remaining before the planned time of awakening. If the 6.25 mg dose is not effective, the dose can be increased to 12.5 mg. In some patients, the higher morning blood levels following use of the 12.5 mg dose increase the risk of next-day impairment of driving and other activities that require full alertness [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. The total dose of AMBIEN CR should not exceed 12.5 mg once daily immediately before bedtime. AMBIEN CR should be taken as a single dose and should not be readministered during the same night.

The recommended initial doses for women and men are different because zolpidem clearance is lower in women.

Treatment with AMBIEN CR should be as short as possible. Extended treatment should not take place without re-evaluation of the patient's status, since the risk of abuse and dependence increases with duration of treatment [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3)].

2.2 Special Populations

Elderly or debilitated patients may be especially sensitive to the effects of zolpidem tartrate. The recommended dose of AMBIEN CR in these patients is 6.25 mg once daily immediately before bedtime [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.5)].

Patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment do not clear the drug as rapidly as normal subjects. The recommended dose of AMBIEN CR in these patients is 6.25 mg once daily immediately before bedtime. Avoid AMBIEN CR use in patients with severe hepatic impairment as it may contribute to encephalopathy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8), Use in Specific Populations (8.7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

2.3 Use with CNS Depressants

Dosage adjustment may be necessary when AMBIEN CR is combined with other CNS-depressant drugs because of the potentially additive effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.7)].

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^b291d2f8]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Benzodiazepine tapering — short-duration use and short-taper option: Although many patients who have been taking BZDs for a short period of time (e.g., less than a month) are able to discontinue the medication without a taper, clinicians can consider a short taper, and a short taper may be indicated if clinicians have concerns for clinically significant withdrawal or patients express concerns about discontinuing the medication.

---

### Supporting patients through benzodiazepine tapering: a new joint clinical practice guideline [^97f8227d]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

The Guideline further highlights the importance of managing expectations of both clinicians and patients. The process of tapering long-term benzodiazepine therapy is often slow and non-linear. Although some patients may have no trouble with a relatively fast taper (e.g. 25% daily dose reduction every 2–4 weeks), others may experience significant challenges even with a much slower taper (e.g. 5% daily dose reduction every 4–6 weeks); patient tolerance of the pace of the taper can also change during the process (e.g. with minimal symptoms at the beginning of the taper (i.e. at higher dose), and substantial challenges at the end of the process, at the "tail-end" of tapering). For some patients, especially those who have been taking benzodiazepines for a long time, the tapering process may last for more than a year. They may need to pause at certain points along the way to adjust to the reduced dose. Sometimes, when withdrawal or other symptoms are intolerable, the patient may need to be maintained on a lower, safer dose of benzodiazepines (or, sometimes, even on the original dose) for an extended period or indefinitely.

A panel of patients with lived experience with tapering benzodiazepine medications were engaged throughout the Guideline development process, providing input on the key clinical questions and outcomes of interest for the systematic review, as well as on the Guideline recommendations and narrative discussion. They emphasized the importance of clinician awareness of heterogeneity in patient response to benzodiazepine tapering, and education on how to manage challenges that may arise. In particular, the patient-advisors expressed the hope that clinicians:
Have awareness of the broad range of potential symptoms of benzodiazepine withdrawal and the risk for protracted withdrawal symptoms, which can last for months or years after the medication has been discontinued;,
Know how to support patients who require very slow tapers, for example, by using "microdosing" (or "microtapering") strategies with liquid benzodiazepine formulations when needed;
Understand, and help patients understand, the importance of giving time for the brain's GABA receptors to return to homeostasis (e.g. avoiding the use of alcohol and sedatives, including other benzodiazepine medications and z-drugs (zolpidem, zopiclone, and zaleplon)).

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^ebf383b3]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Benzodiazepine tapering versus abrupt discontinuation — comparative evidence and guidance: "If patients are at risk of withdrawal, the medication should be tapered rather than abruptly discontinued". In limited evidence, "the systematic review identified two RCTs with 70 participants that compared a BZD taper to abrupt cessation"; "Both RCTs had an unclear risk of bias", and although labeled gradual "the taper duration was only 7–8 days". There was "no difference in the rate of complete BZD discontinuation, return to BZD use after a period of discontinuation, delirium, or study completion", but the taper group had "significantly less severe BZD withdrawal and insomnia symptoms after 4 days, and up to 4 weeks". The CCG agreed that benefits of tapering are "likely to outweigh the risks of abrupt discontinuation, especially when using more gradual tapering strategies".

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^e9f41277]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Benzodiazepine tapering — risk–benefit rationale and duration guidance: In 2020, the FDA updated the required Boxed Warning for BZD medications to describe the risks of physical dependence, withdrawal, and BZD use disorder. Long-term BZD use is often associated with more risks than benefits, with risks including oversedation, cognitive impairment, falls, motor vehicle accidents, and fatal and nonfatal overdose. Short-term BZD use is associated with decreased anxiety and insomnia, with duration of use typically recommended to not exceed 4 weeks, and therapeutic effects diminished within days to weeks.

Comparators were "alternative interventions, treatment as usual, placebo, or active control condition," and outcomes included "BZD cessation or dose reduction, BZD withdrawal severity, recurrence or rebound of BZD-indicated conditions (e.g., insomnia, anxiety), sleep problems, cognition, mood, quality of life and patient satisfaction, global functioning, study attrition, other substance use, and adverse events."

5.3 Abnormal thinking and behavioral changes

A variety of abnormal thinking and behavior changes have been reported to occur in association with the use of sedative/hypnotics. Some of these changes may be characterized by decreased inhibition (e.g. aggressiveness and extroversion that seemed out of character), similar to effects produced by alcohol and other CNS depressants. Visual and auditory hallucinations have been reported as well as behavioral changes such as bizarre behavior, agitation and depersonalization. In controlled trials, < 1% of adults with insomnia who received zolpidem reported hallucinations. In a clinical trial, 7.4% of pediatric patients with insomnia associated with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), who received zolpidem reported hallucinations [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].

Complex behaviors such as "sleep-driving" (i.e., driving while not fully awake after ingestion of a sedative-hypnotic, with amnesia for the event) have been reported with sedative-hypnotics, including zolpidem. These events can occur in sedative-hypnotic-naive as well as in sedative-hypnotic-experienced persons. Although behaviors such as "sleep-driving" may occur with Ambien CR alone at therapeutic doses, the use of alcohol and other CNS depressants with Ambien CR appears to increase the risk of such behaviors, as does the use of Ambien CR at doses exceeding the maximum recommended dose. Due to the risk to the patient and the community, discontinuation of Ambien CR should be strongly considered for patients who report a "sleep-driving" episode. Other complex behaviors (e.g., preparing and eating food, making phone calls, or having sex) have been reported in patients who are not fully awake after taking a sedative-hypnotic. As with "sleep-driving", patients usually do not remember these events. Amnesia, anxiety and other neuro-psychiatric symptoms may occur unpredictably.

In primarily depressed patients, worsening of depression, including suicidal thoughts and actions (including completed suicides), have been reported in association with the use of sedative/hypnotics.

It can rarely be determined with certainty whether a particular instance of the abnormal behaviors listed above is drug induced, spontaneous in origin, or a result of an underlying psychiatric or physical disorder. Nonetheless, the emergence of any new behavioral sign or symptom of concern requires careful and immediate evaluation.

METHODOLOGY

ASAM's Quality Improvement Council (QIC) and Clinical Practice Guideline Methodology and Oversight Committee (CPG-MOS) oversaw the development of this Guideline. The FDA provided guidance on the content and development of the Guideline but did not dictate the content. The QIC, working with partner professional societies and the FDA, oversaw the appointment of a Clinical Guideline Committee (CGC) comprised of clinicians representing ten medical and professional societies with broad subject matter expertise across medicine, psychiatry, and pharmacology. A panel of individuals who have lived experience with BZD tapering (the Patient Panel) provided input during the development of the Guideline.

The following key clinical questions were addressed in the systematic literature review:
What is the efficacy and/or safety of tapering strategies for BZDs?
What factors influence the outcomes of BZD tapering and should be monitored?
How can shared decision-making and patient-centered health care be utilized to support the effectiveness and safety of BZD tapering?

These questions were used to develop a Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome (PICO) framework for identifying relevant research literature to answer each of the key clinical questions.
Population: Adults who have been using one or more BZD medication for at least 2–4 weeks, including those with benzodiazepine use disorder
Intervention: two types of interventions were considered: Interventions that promote the successful discontinuation of BZD use Interventions that manage withdrawal symptoms when discontinuing BZDs
Comparator: alternative interventions, treatment as usual, placebo, or active control condition
Outcome: BZD cessation or dose reduction, BZD withdrawal severity, recurrence or rebound of BZD-indicated conditions (e.g. insomnia, anxiety), sleep problems, cognition, mood, quality of life and patient satisfaction, global functioning, study attrition, other substance use, and adverse events

Tapering Versus Discontinuation

If the clinician determines, in the context of the risk/benefit assessment and shared decision-making, continuing the BZD prescription is no longer appropriate, they need to first determine if patients are likely to be physically dependent on the medication, and therefore at risk of withdrawal. The risk of severe withdrawal syndrome following regular use of therapeutic doses of BZD has been recognized since the 1960 s. Factors including use of shorter acting BZD, higher dose, and longer duration of treatment contribute to a higher likelihood of physical dependence and risk of severe withdrawal.

If patients are at risk of withdrawal, the medication should be tapered rather than abruptly discontinued. While limited evidence was found comparing tapering strategies, the systematic review identified two RCTs with 70 participants that compared a BZD taper to abrupt cessation. Both RCTs had an unclear risk of bias. Although labeled "gradual," the taper duration was only 7–8 days. There was no difference in the rate of complete BZD discontinuation, return to BZD use after a period of discontinuation, delirium, or study completion between groups. However, patients in the tapering group reported significantly less severe BZD withdrawal and insomnia symptoms after 4 days, and up to 4 weeks, compared to patients who abruptly stopped their BZD use. In discussing these studies, the CGC agreed that benefits of tapering are likely to outweigh the risks of abrupt discontinuation, especially when using more gradual tapering strategies. See Table 1 in Supplementary Material 5 for the full Evidence to Decision Table comprising these studies.

Outpatient taper management — algorithm directs clinicians first to ask, "Would the patient benefit from transitioning to a longer-acting BZD?", and if yes to "Transition to longer-acting BZD" by "Estimate equivalent dose," "Transition one dose at a time, over 1–2 weeks," and "Adjust dose based on patient response"; otherwise "Determine initial dose reduction," with "Typical initial dose reduction: 5–10% every 2–4 weeks; Generally not more than 25% every 2 weeks," then "Monitor withdrawal symptoms," use the branch "No or mild withdrawal symptoms" to "Consider similar pace for next dose reduction," and employ supportive steps including "Offer adjunctive interventions/medications as appropriate," "Consider switching to a longer-acting BZD," "Consider maintaining on lower dose if further dose reductions are not tolerated," and "If paused, consider slower taper when ready to resume," while ensuring to "Engage in shared decision making process with the patient (and care partner[s]) whenever possible."

Benzodiazepine tapering — determining whether and where to taper outlines an algorithm that begins by asking, "Do the risks of continued prescribing outweigh the benefits?" while noting "Risks associated with BZD tapering should also be considered"; if the patient is not "likely to have physical dependence?," "Discontinuation or a short taper is recommended. Monitor withdrawal symptoms and adjust approach as needed." If "Tapering is recommended," clinicians then assess, "Can the patient be safely treated in an outpatient setting?" to determine care setting.

Benzodiazepine tapering — care coordination, consolidation, and assessment advise that prior to initiating a BZD taper, clinicians should attempt to coordinate care with a patient's other BZD prescribers and clinicians managing co-occurring conditions, and clinicians managing the taper should ideally assume management of all of a patient's BZD prescriptions. If patients have been taking different BZDs, clinicians should convert and consolidate the medications to an equivalent dose of a single BZD prior to beginning the taper. A mutually agreed upon tapering rate between patients and clinicians that avoids a very prolonged taper duration can be an effective strategy for BZD discontinuation. Clinicians should consider the likelihood of a given patient developing withdrawal symptoms during the taper and the anticipated severity of those symptoms, noting that BZD withdrawal symptoms can range from anxiety and sleep problems to seizures and delirium.

FINAL THOUGHTS

Many of the topics discussed in this Guideline lacked controlled studies. Our systematic review found no trials comparing BZD tapering strategies or other important aspects of managing patients who are taking prescribed BZDs and likely to have developed physical dependence. Further research into best practices for BZD tapering strategies that support patient safety and optimal outcomes is urgently needed.

Benzodiazepine tapering — management when stopping without a taper: If the BZD medication is discontinued without a taper in patients who are unlikely to be physically dependent, clinicians should counsel patients to report the emergence of withdrawal and/or rebound symptoms (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation). If significant symptoms emerge, clinicians can consider using medications for symptom management or restarting the BZD medication and initiating a taper (Clinical Consensus, Conditional Recommendation).

5.2 CNS-Depressant Effects and Next-Day Impairment

AMBIEN CR is a CNS depressant and can impair daytime function in some patients even when used as prescribed. Prescribers should monitor for excess depressant effects, but impairment can occur in the absence of subjective symptoms, and may not be reliably detected by ordinary clinical exam (i.e. less than formal psychomotor testing). While pharmacodynamic tolerance or adaptation to some adverse depressant effects of AMBIEN CR may develop, patients using AMBIEN CR should be cautioned against driving or engaging in other hazardous activities or activities requiring complete mental alertness the day after use.

Additive effects occur with concomitant use of other CNS depressants (e.g., benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants, alcohol), including daytime use [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. Downward dose adjustment of AMBIEN CR and concomitant CNS depressants should be considered [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

The use of AMBIEN CR with other sedative-hypnotics (including other zolpidem products) at bedtime or the middle of the night is not recommended.

The risk of next-day psychomotor impairment is increased if AMBIEN CR is taken with less than a full night of sleep remaining (7 to 8 hours); if higher than the recommended dose is taken; if coadministered with other CNS depressants or alcohol; or coadministered with other drugs that increase the blood levels of zolpidem. Patients should be warned against driving and other activities requiring complete mental alertness if AMBIEN CR is taken in these circumstances [see Dosage and Administration (2), Clinical Studies (14.2)].

Vehicle drivers and machine operators should be warned that, as with other hypnotics, there may be a possible risk of adverse reactions including drowsiness, prolonged reaction time, dizziness, sleepiness, blurred/double vision, reduced alertness, and impaired driving the morning after therapy. In order to minimize this risk a full night of sleep (7–8 hours) is recommended.

Because AMBIEN CR can cause drowsiness and a decreased level of consciousness, patients, particularly the elderly, are at higher risk of falls.

Benzodiazepine tapering implementation — level of care and follow-up: Tapering initiated in an inpatient or residential medically managed level of care may be continued in a less intensive level of care once it is safe to do so. When tapering with very long-acting agents, discharge planning should include an outpatient follow-up appointment, ideally within 7 days. Clinicians should assess patients for ongoing signs or symptoms related to discontinuation of the BZD, including re-emergence of symptoms for which the BZD was originally prescribed, and should consider medications and/or behavioral interventions to address ongoing signs or symptoms related to discontinuation of the BZD.

Key takeaways — tapering approach and setting: Clinicians should consider approaches to BZD tapering in collaboration with patients and care partners using shared decision‑making strategies, and clinicians should not discontinue BZDs abruptly in patients who are likely to be physically dependent and at risk of withdrawal symptoms; physical dependence can develop within weeks and is heterogeneous across patients; although most patients can complete tapering in outpatient settings, clinicians should consider inpatient or medically managed residential care when significant risk cannot be safely managed as an outpatient; clinicians should design the taper to minimize harms, with an initial pace generally including dose reductions of 5 to 10% every 2–4 weeks, and the taper should typically not exceed 25% every 2 weeks; a boxed caution also states BZDs should not be discontinued abruptly and dosage should be tapered gradually over time under clinical supervision.

Benzodiazepine tapering — post-discontinuation follow-up states that a patient's adjustment to benzodiazepine discontinuation and need for clinician support may last well beyond the time it takes for the drug to be eliminated; although gradual dose reductions and slow tapers may help prevent protracted withdrawal, clinicians should follow up after discontinuation to monitor for and manage symptoms; patients with long-term use may struggle to avoid returning to use and may benefit from ongoing monitoring; clinicians should educate patients with protracted withdrawal symptoms and reassure them that symptoms are likely to resolve as their brains adjust, which may take months; psychosocial support may be helpful; clinicians should avoid reinstating the benzodiazepine but can consider prescribing non-benzodiazepine medications for symptom management when patients are unable to tolerate withdrawal management.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^cd40a0ea]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Benzodiazepine withdrawal risk and determining physical dependence: when discontinuation is appropriate, clinicians "need to first determine if patients are likely to be physically dependent on the medication, and therefore at risk of withdrawal". The risk of severe withdrawal has "been recognized since the 1960 s", and factors increasing risk include "use of shorter acting BZD, higher dose, and longer duration of treatment". Many patients using BZDs for a short time "(e.g., less than a month)" may stop without withdrawal, but those using low doses for an intermediate time "(e.g., 6 weeks)" may not be dependent. For alprazolam, which has "a very short half-life, rapid onset of action, and no active metabolites", dependence can occur more rapidly; therefore, "a taper may be appropriate" even for daily use of short duration "(e.g., 2–4 weeks)". If dependence is uncertain, clinicians "should elicit information from patients" about concerns and preferences, and strict thresholds are difficult because risk is influenced by multiple patient and drug factors.

Box 2 note of caution — avoid misapplication of this Guideline explains that clinical practice guidelines can have unintended impacts on clinical decision-making and that misapplication of the 2016 CDC opioid recommendations led some prescribers to abruptly discontinue pain medications without first developing a plan for safe tapering, putting patients at risk of withdrawal and potential transition to illegally obtained opioids. It warns that abrupt discontinuation of BZDs confers similar and additional risks: rapid BZD dose reduction can cause life-threatening withdrawal symptoms such as seizures and delirium and potential destabilization of existing mental health conditions, especially in those taking long-term BZDs and at higher doses. It states that BZDs should not be discontinued abruptly in patients who are likely to have developed physical dependence and that clinicians and healthcare systems should carefully consider how to meet the needs of patients requiring BZD tapering, including those who experience significant challenges during the tapering process.

### Comparative effectiveness of interventions to facilitate deprescription of benzodiazepines and other sedative hypnotics: systematic review and meta-analysis [^1a7562a3]. BMJ (2025). Excellent credibility.

Methods

We developed a protocol for this systematic review and meta-analysis, which was reviewed and approved by the BE SAFE collaborators in February 2023 and registered online on Open Science Framework. We report our study according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) checklist.

Eligibility criteria

Eligible studies randomised adult patients using BSH for insomnia to interventions aimed at deprescribing or discontinuation of BSH, strategies to implement these interventions, or standard care or placebo. Examples of eligible interventions include, but are not limited to, supervised tapering with or without drug support, education of patients about the harms of BSH, education of healthcare providers, behavioural interventions such as cognitive behavioural therapy, and system level interventions such as implementing new protocols or services in healthcare facilities. BSH drugs include but are not limited to benzodiazepines (for example, diazepam, alprazolam) and non-benzodiazepine "z-drugs" (for example, zolpidem, zaleplon). We did not restrict eligibility on the basis of duration of BSH use.

We anticipated that some trials would recruit patients who used BSH for a mix of different conditions and that some trials may not report the primary reason for which patients were using BSH. We included such trials unless explicit evidence showed that 60% or more of patients were using BSH for conditions other than insomnia. However, we did subgroup analyses investigating differences in results between trials in which patients were explicitly using BSH for insomnia and other trials in which the reason for using BSH was not reported.

Eligible designs included parallel, cluster, or crossover-by-cluster randomised trials. We excluded crossover trials because successful discontinuation of BSH in the first phase of the trial would render patients ineligible for subsequent phases of crossover. We did not restrict eligibility on the basis of language or time of publication. We excluded observational studies; systematic, scoping, or narrative reviews; trials that investigated interventions that only targeted discontinuation of non-BSH drugs; and trials that investigated the effectiveness of societal interventions (for example, messaging in the media).

We also excluded trials with fewer than 20 patients per arm. We anticipated that smaller trials would contribute little to meta-analyses, be at higher risk of publication bias, and more often include unrepresentative samples and trial arms that were prognostically imbalanced.

Benzodiazepine tapering — risk factors for severe withdrawal and implications for taper pace — "The development of more severe BZD withdrawal symptoms is associated with use of BZDs with a shorter half-life and fewer active metabolites (e.g., alprazolam), daily use, higher total daily dose, longer duration of use, and history of severe withdrawal." Accordingly, "A slower initial pace of BZD tapering is likely to be safer and more effective for patients who have a high likelihood of physical dependence and significant risk of withdrawal," and "patients should be involved in determining the initial and ongoing tapering pace with clinicians, with the pace ideally agreed upon in a shared decision-making process." The guideline also notes that psychiatric comorbidity complicates tapering: "The presence of certain psychiatric symptoms has been associated with an increased likelihood of experiencing more severe withdrawal symptoms," with examples including "higher levels of anxiety" and personality disorder traits that "often experience considerable difficulty discontinuing BZDs."

Scope of Guideline

This Guideline focuses on whether and how to taper BZD medications, exploring considerations for assessing risks and benefits of continued prescribing, partnering with patients, level of care considerations, and tapering strategies, including management of withdrawal symptoms. It pertains to patients who have been taking BZDs regularly and are at risk of physical dependence and withdrawal. This Guideline also addresses population-specific considerations, including for patients co-prescribed BZDs and opioids, patients with SUD, patients with other psychiatric disorders, older adults, and pregnant and lactating patients.

This Guideline is not applicable to patients who are prescribed BZDs but are not taking them regularly (Box 2). It is also not applicable to patients who are prescribed BZDs for a short period of time (e.g. for under 2 weeks for the management of agitation, acute anxiety, or alcohol withdrawal). Considerations related to initiation of BZDs, ongoing management of BZD prescriptions, and management of underlying conditions are beyond the scope of this Guideline. Additionally, although non-BZD sedative–hypnotic medications such as barbiturates and Z-drugs (i.e. eszopiclone, zaleplon, and zolpidem) have similar mechanisms of action to BZDs and may pose similar risks, they are beyond the scope of this Guideline. Finally, considerations for BZD tapering in children and adolescents (i.e. < 18 years old) are beyond the scope of this Guideline.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).

Inform patients and their families about the benefits and risks of treatment with Zolpidem Tartrate Tablets. Inform patients of the availability of a Medication Guide and instruct them to read the Medication Guide prior to initiating treatment with Zolpidem Tartrate Tablets and with each prescription refill. Review the Zolpidem Tartrate Tablets Medication Guide with every patient prior to initiation of treatment. Instruct patients or caregivers that Zolpidem Tartrate Tablets should be taken only as prescribed.

Complex Sleep Behaviors

Instruct patients and their families that Zolpidem Tartrate Tablets may cause complex sleep behaviors, including sleep-walking, sleep-driving, preparing and eating food, making phone calls, or having sex while not being fully awake. Serious injuries and death have occurred during complex sleep behavior episodes. Tell patients to discontinue Zolpidem Tartrate Tablets and notify their healthcare provider immediately if they develop any of these symptoms [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]

CNS-Depressant Effects and Next-Day Impairment

Tell patients that Zolpidem Tartrate Tablets have the potential to cause next-day impairment, and that this risk is increased if dosing instructions are not carefully followed. Tell patients to wait for at least 8 hours after dosing before driving or engaging in other activities requiring full mental alertness. Inform patients that impairment can be present despite feeling fully awake. Advise patients that increased drowsiness and decreased consciousness may increase the risk of falls in some patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]

Although factors that increase the risk of withdrawal are known, no established way to accurately predict which patients may have more difficulty with the taper currently exists. Many patients who have been taking BZDs for less than a month, particularly at low doses, are unlikely to be physically dependent and typically able to discontinue the medication without a taper. However, physical dependence can develop within weeks and is heterogeneous across patients. As a result, determining whether a patient is at risk of withdrawal is not always clear (see Table 3). Depending on the specific BZD medication and patient characteristics, some patients who have been taking prescribed BZDs daily or near daily for less than a month may benefit from tapering. One of the most significant challenges the CGC faced in writing this Guideline was developing tapering recommendations that apply broadly in the context of this patient heterogeneity. The recommendations in this Guideline provide flexibility and encourage close patient monitoring to account for the heterogeneity of patient responses.

The CGC noted that patient support is a key factor in the success of a taper, particularly given the heterogeneity in responses to BZD tapering. It is important to educate patients on what to do if they experience concerning symptoms and how to contact their clinicians, if necessary, before the next scheduled visit. This can help patients feel more confident and in control of a process that is often associated with some level of apprehension.

Prior to initiating a BZD taper, clinicians should attempt to coordinate care with a patient's other BZD prescribers, if applicable, and clinicians managing co-occurring conditions that may be impacted by the taper. In addition, clinicians managing the taper should ideally assume management of all of a patient's BZD prescriptions. If patients have been taking different BZDs, clinicians should convert and consolidate the medications to an equivalent dose of a single BZD prior to beginning the taper (see Appendix B for BZD dose equivalents). A mutually agreed upon tapering rate between patients and clinicians that avoids a very prolonged taper duration can be an effective strategy for BZD discontinuation.

Management of protracted withdrawal after benzodiazepine (BZD) discontinuation — Some patients may experience protracted symptoms of withdrawal after BZD discontinuation, which may result from a combination of physical and psychological BZD dependence and the neurological effects of BZDs. Longer-term BZD use and use of high-dose, rapid-acting BZDs increase the risk of protracted withdrawal, although these post-acute symptoms can also occur after discontinuation of low-dose BZDs. Protracted symptoms persist beyond the expected elimination of the BZD (e.g., 4–6 weeks), and some patients experience symptoms for months or years; in a convenience sample of 1,200 individuals more than 50% reported feeling dependent when taking benzodiazepines, and a large survey estimated that 54% sought medical services after BZD discontinuation. Although limited research exists, the CCG agreed protracted withdrawal causes significant harms for a subset of patients, and current guidance suggests gradual dose reductions and slow tapers may reduce the risk of protracted withdrawal symptoms.

5.1 Complex Sleep Behaviors

Complex sleep behaviors, including sleep-walking, sleep-driving, and engaging in other activities while not fully awake, may occur following the first or any subsequent use of Zolpidem Tartrate Tablets. Patients can be seriously injured or injure others during complex sleep behaviors. Such injuries may result in a fatal outcome. Other complex sleep behaviors (e.g., preparing and eating food, making phone calls, or having sex) have also been reported. Patients usually do not remember these events. Postmarketing reports have shown that complex sleep behaviors may occur with Zolpidem Tartrate Tablets alone at recommended doses, with or without the concomitant use of alcohol or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants [see Drug Interaction (7.1)]. Discontinue Zolpidem Tartrate Tablets immediately if a patient experiences a complex sleep behavior [see Contraindications (4)].

### Masked taper with behavioral intervention for discontinuation of benzodiazepine receptor agonists: a randomized clinical trial [^de876d8a]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

The study SWITCH (insomnia) was published by Constance H Fung and colleagues in 2024 in the journal JAMA Intern Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Insomnia. In the SWITCH (insomnia) study, the trial question was: what is the role of masked taper of BZRA plus CBT-augmented program in patients with current or prior insomnia? In the SWITCH (insomnia) study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the SWITCH (insomnia) study, the population was: 188 patients (65 female, 123 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients aged ≥ 55 years who had used lorazepam, alprazolam, clonazepam, temazepam, and/or zolpidem for current or prior insomnia, at doses of < 8 mg diazepam-equivalent ≥ 2 nights/week for at least 3 months. The key exclusion criteria were high risk for withdrawal complications; poor candidate for CBT-I; discontinuation of BZRA inappropriate; unstable housing. In the SWITCH (insomnia) study, the interventions were: n = 92 masked taper (masked taper plus augmented CBT-I) n = 96 supervised gradual taper (unmasked gradual taper CBT-I). In the SWITCH (insomnia) study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in successful BZRA discontinuation at 6 months (73.4% vs. 58.6%; OR 1.95, 95% CI 1.03 to 3.7). In the SWITCH (insomnia) study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in the rate of successful BZRA discontinuation 1 week after treatment (88.4% vs. 67.4%; HR 3.68, 95% CI 1.67 to 8.12) No significant difference in Insomnia Severity Index score at 6 months (-6.41 points vs. -6.57 points; AD 0.16 points, 95% CI -1.89 to 2.2) No significant difference in Insomnia Severity Index score 1 week after treatment (-6.43 points vs. -7.81 points; AD 1.38 points, 95% CI -0.52 to 3.29). In the SWITCH (insomnia) study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in adverse events. In the SWITCH (insomnia) study, the conclusion was: in adult patients aged ≥ 55 years who had used lorazepam, alprazolam, clonazepam, temazepam, and/or zolpidem for current or prior insomnia, at doses of < 8 mg diazepam-equivalent ≥ 2 nights/week for at least 3 months, masked taper was superior to supervised gradual taper with respect to successful BZRA discontinuation at 6 months.

Tapering Strategies

BZDs should not be discontinued abruptly in patients who are likely to have developed physical dependence and are at risk of significant withdrawal symptoms (see Table 3). Most existing clinical guidance documents emphasize the importance of gradual dose reductions to discontinue BZD use in these patients. Clinicians can suggest a trial dose reduction for patients who are extremely reluctant or anxious about tapering rather than asking them to commit to a tapering plan. This approach may increase patients' motivation, self-efficacy, and willingness to continue with tapering. However, clinicians should clearly communicate any concerns for patients' safety with ongoing BZD use.

Several BZD tapering strategies have been described in the literature. Evaluated tapering schedules vary from a faster pace of reductions of 10 to 25% every 1–2 weeks to a slower pace of 5 to 10% every 2–4 weeks, with even more gradual reduction at lower doses when approaching discontinuation. Clinical trials that reduced doses at a faster pace tended to have high patient dropout rates. Schweizer et al.noted that 25% weekly dose reductions was too fast for about half of the participants. Oude Voshaar et al.evaluated the same pace and found that nearly a quarter of participants dropped out. Guidelines that outline specific tapering protocols generally recommend limiting dose reductions to no more than 25% every 2 weeks. The CGC highlighted the importance of considering a patient's BZD dose, frequency, and duration of use when determining an approach to tapering.

Clinicians should take each patient's risk–benefit balance into account when developing tapering strategies. A more rapid taper may be indicated for patients who have significant imminent safety risks associated with continued BZD use that will not be mitigated sufficiently with smaller dose reductions. If risks are not imminent, clinicians should consider patient preferences more heavily when developing tapering strategies and seek to minimize risks associated with tapering, including withdrawal symptoms.

Feasibility issues may influence the tapering strategy. When patients are taking the lowest available dose for a given BZD, reducing the dose by 5% or 10% can be challenging. Although some tablets can be accurately cut in half or even quarters with a pill splitter, smaller dose reductions are more difficult to achieve. Clinicians can consider converting the prescription to lower strengths of the same medication as an initial step to facilitate the tapering process. The availability of a greater range of low-dose formulations for commonly prescribed BZDs would help facilitate BZD tapering.

Benzodiazepine tapering — managing mild to moderate withdrawal symptoms — "Most patients (but not all) will experience mild to moderate withdrawal symptoms during the BZD taper." When symptoms are challenging, "the CGC recommends first pausing or slowing the tapering schedule per Recommendation 11 and incorporating adjunctive psychosocial interventions per Recommendation 10." If those measures are unsuccessful, "clinicians and patients may decide through a shared decision-making approach to explore adjunctive pharmacological interventions."

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^1c333120]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Description

The American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) has partnered with nine other medical societies and professional associations representing a wide range of clinical settings and patient populations to provide guidance on evidence-based strategies for tapering benzodiazepine (BZD) medication across a variety of settings.

Methods

The guideline was developed following modified GRADE methodology and clinical consensus process. The process included a systematic literature review as well as several targeted supplemental searches. The clinical practice guideline was revised based on external stakeholder review.

Recommendations

Key takeaways included the following: Clinicians should engage in ongoing risk–benefit assessment of BZD use/tapering, clinicians should utilize shared decision-making strategies in collaboration with patients, clinicians should not discontinue BZDs abruptly in patients who are likely to be physically dependent and at risk of withdrawal, clinicians should tailor tapering strategies to each patient and adjust tapering based on patient response, and clinicians should offer patients adjunctive psychosocial interventions to support successful tapering.

Benzodiazepine tapering — adjusting strategy and handling interruptions describes that tapering strategies should be adjusted when patients experience significant symptoms related to the taper, with options including slowing the pace, making smaller dose reductions, and/or pausing; clinicians should generally avoid going back up to a previous dose but can consider resuming the previous dose until patients stabilize; the guideline defines pausing (remain at the current dose until symptoms stabilize, then continue reductions) and maintaining (adjust to a lower dose and remain on that lower dose as a partial taper) when the risks of continuing taper outweigh benefits; the dose should be maintained at the reduced level and dose increases avoided unless absolutely necessary, noting that the harms of benzodiazepines are dose-dependent and that maintaining at a lower dose may reduce current risk such that risks no longer outweigh benefits.

5.3 Need to Evaluate for Comorbid Diagnoses

Because sleep disturbances may be the presenting manifestation of a physical and/or psychiatric disorder, symptomatic treatment of insomnia should be initiated only after a careful evaluation of the patient. The failure of insomnia to remit after 7 to 10 days of treatment may indicate the presence of a primary psychiatric and/or medical illness that should be evaluated. Worsening of insomnia or the emergence of new thinking or behavior abnormalities may be the consequence of an unrecognized psychiatric or physical disorder. Such findings have emerged during the course of treatment with sedative/hypnotic drugs, including zolpidem.

5.4 Severe Anaphylactic and Anaphylactoid Reactions

Cases of angioedema involving the tongue, glottis or larynx have been reported in patients after taking the first or subsequent doses of sedative-hypnotics, including zolpidem. Some patients have had additional symptoms such as dyspnea, throat closing or nausea and vomiting that suggest anaphylaxis. Some patients have required medical therapy in the emergency department. If angioedema involves the throat, glottis or larynx, airway obstruction may occur and be fatal. Patients who develop angioedema after treatment with zolpidem should not be rechallenged with the drug.

5.5 Abnormal Thinking and Behavioral Changes

Abnormal thinking and behavior changes have been reported in patients treated with sedative/hypnotics, including AMBIEN CR. Some of these changes included decreased inhibition (e.g., aggressiveness and extroversion that seemed out of character), bizarre behavior, agitation and depersonalization. Visual and auditory hallucinations have been reported.

In controlled trials, < 1% of adults with insomnia reported hallucinations. In a clinical trial, 7% of pediatric patients treated with Ambien 0.25 mg/kg taken at bedtime reported hallucinations versus 0% treated with placebo [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]. There have been postmarketing reports of delirium with zolpidem use [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

It can rarely be determined with certainty whether a particular instance of the abnormal behaviors listed above is drug induced, spontaneous in origin, or a result of an underlying psychiatric or physical disorder. Nonetheless, the emergence of any new behavioral sign or symptom of concern requires careful and immediate evaluation.

The Tapering Process

Recommendations for the Tapering Process

6 Clinicians should generally consider dose reductions of 5 to 10% when determining the initial pace of the BZD taper. The pace of the taper should typically not exceed 25% every 2 weeks (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation).
7 Clinicians can consider transitioning patients without contraindications to a comparable dose of a longer-acting BZD medication for the taper (Clinical Consensus, Conditional Recommendation).
8 Clinicians should tailor tapering strategies to each individual patient and adjust the taper based on a patient's response (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation).
9 Clinicians should evaluate patients undergoing tapering for signs and symptoms related to the BZD taper with each dose reduction (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation).

Implementation Considerations
Prior to beginning a taper, clinicians should conduct a thorough medication and health review, with particular attention to other psychoactive medications and conditions that may be impacted during the taper.
Clinicians should design the overall tapering strategy to minimize harms, considering the risk of harm related to continued BZD use and the risk of harms related to tapering the BZD (e.g. withdrawal symptoms, recurrence of symptoms for which the BZD was originally prescribed).
Clinicians should consider the lower end of the dose reduction range (i.e. 5%) for the first reduction to assess a patient's initial response, unless there are imminent safety concerns.
For patients who are likely to have strong physical dependence (e.g. those who have been taking a high dose for more than a year), clinicians should consider a slower taper. For the first reduction, consider the lower end of the dose reduction range (e.g. 5%). For further reductions, clinicians should adjust based on patients' initial response, considering reduction of 5 to 10% every 6–8 weeks, or slower as appropriate.
Clinicians can consider the higher end of the dose reduction range (i.e. 10–25%) for patients who are unlikely to have significant physical dependence (i.e. patients who have been taking a lower dose of BZD for a shorter period of time [e.g. less than 3 months]) but for whom tapering is indicated.
When developing tapering strategies, clinicians should consider patients' current BZD dose and half-life, frequency and duration of BZD use, co-occurring physical and mental health conditions, and responses to previous missed doses and any prior BZD tapering attempts. Clinicians should also consider patient concerns and anxiety around tapering.
When patients are taking multiple doses of BZDs each day, clinicians should carefully consider which dose to reduce first. For example, first reducing earlier doses may be appropriate if insomnia is a greater concern, whereas first reducing later doses may be more appropriate if daytime anxiety is a greater concern.
Tapering strategies, including dosing frequency, should account for the pharmacokinetic properties of the BZD to avoid sharp declines in BZD receptor occupancy.
Clinicians should monitor patients for symptoms of withdrawal and recurrence with each dose reduction. Virtual or telephonic check-ins can be leveraged for this purpose.
Clinicians should monitor patients for post-acute signs and symptoms of withdrawal for 2–4 weeks after full discontinuation of the BZD. Clinicians should manage any ongoing symptoms, as appropriate (see " Management of Protracted Withdrawal "), and regularly monitor patients until symptoms are resolved. Telehealth, including audio-only check-ins, may help facilitate monitoring.
Clinicians should consider pausing or slowing the pace of the taper and/or making smaller dose reductions for patients experiencing significant symptoms related to the BZD taper.
The BZD tapering process can be more difficult for patients as they approach the point of discontinuation. Clinicians should proactively consider smaller dose reductions and/or slowing the pace of dose reductions as the taper progresses.
If patients are unable to tolerate further BZD dose reductions, clinicians can consider — in partnership with patients, their care partners, and other members of the care team — maintaining patients on the lower BZD dose with regular risk–benefit assessments consistent with Recommendation 1.
In some limited instances when patients are experiencing intolerable symptoms, returning to the prior BZD dose and pausing the taper until symptoms stabilize may be appropriate.
In limited instances when necessary for patient safety, inpatient and medically managed residential settings may use more rapid tapering strategies (see "Tapering with Very Long-Acting Agents").

Associated with Discontinuation of Treatment

Approximately 4% of 1,701 patients who received Zolpidem at all doses (1.25 to 90 mg) in U.S. premarketing clinical trials discontinued treatment because of an adverse reaction. Reactions most commonly associated with discontinuation from U.S. trials were daytime drowsiness (0.5%), dizziness (0.4%), headache (0.5%), nausea (0.6%), and vomiting (0.5%).

Approximately 4% of 1,959 patients who received Zolpidem at all doses (1 to 50 mg) in similar foreign trials discontinued treatment because of an adverse reaction. Reactions most commonly associated with discontinuation from these trials were daytime drowsiness (1.1%), dizziness/vertigo (0.8%), amnesia (0.5%), nausea (0.5%), headache (0.4%), and falls (0.4%).

Data from a clinical study in which selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)-treated patients were given Zolpidem revealed that four of the seven discontinuations during double-blind treatment with Zolpidem (n = 95) were associated with impaired concentration, continuing or aggravated depression, and manic reaction; one patient treated with placebo (n = 97) was discontinued after an attempted suicide.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^77c6ef73]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Benzodiazepine (BZD) tapering — level of care considerations — BZD tapering can typically be managed in outpatient settings; however, clinicians should consider inpatient care for BZD tapering when patient presentation indicates an imminent risk of significant harm related to continued use that is unlikely to be rapidly mitigated by the initial dose reduction of the BZD taper (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation), when patient symptoms and/or co-occurring physical or mental health conditions are anticipated to complicate BZD tapering in a way that cannot be safely managed in an outpatient setting (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation), or when the patient is experiencing or imminently anticipated to experience severe or complicated BZD withdrawal (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation).

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^450bb661]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Benzodiazepine tapering — heterogeneity and withdrawal risk indicates that although factors that increase the risk of withdrawal are known, no established way to accurately predict which patients may have more difficulty with the taper currently exists. Many patients who have been taking BZDs for less than a month, particularly at low doses, are unlikely to be physically dependent and typically able to discontinue the medication without a taper; however, physical dependence can develop within weeks and is heterogeneous across patients, making it not always clear whether a patient is at risk of withdrawal. Depending on the specific BZD medication and patient characteristics, some patients who have been taking prescribed BZDs daily or near daily for less than a month may benefit from tapering. The recommendations in this Guideline provide flexibility and encourage close patient monitoring to account for the heterogeneity of patient responses, and the CGC noted that patient support is a key factor in the success of a taper. It can be helpful for clinicians and patients to discuss what to expect with the taper, how to manage withdrawal symptoms, and how to contact clinicians before the next scheduled visit to help patients feel more confident and in control.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^7250da58]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Benzodiazepine tapering — schedule options and feasibility indicate that evaluated tapering schedules vary from a faster pace of reductions of 10 to 25% every 1–2 weeks to a slower pace of 5 to 10% every 2–4 weeks, and guidelines that outline specific tapering protocols generally recommend limiting dose reductions to no more than 25% every 2 weeks. Clinical trial experience notes that 25% weekly dose reductions was too fast for about half of the participants. When patients are taking the lowest available dose for a given benzodiazepine (BZD), reducing the dose by 5% or 10% can be challenging, and although some tablets can be accurately cut in half or even quarters with a pill splitter, smaller dose reductions are more difficult to achieve. Clinicians should take each patient's risk–benefit balance into account when developing tapering strategies and should also consider patients' underlying conditions or symptoms for which BZDs are being used to manage when developing tapering strategies; for example, if BZDs have been used to manage anxiety with insomnia, clinicians can recommend tapering the morning dose first.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^018e7238]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Benzodiazepine tapering — patient-specific strategy and goals: Patients who have been taking lower doses for a relatively short period of time (e.g., < 3 months) may be able to taper more quickly, and the goal of tapering may be discontinuing the benzodiazepine (BZD) medication or reducing the BZD dose to the point where the risks no longer outweigh the benefits. Clinicians should tailor tapering strategies to each individual patient and adjust tapering based on patient response; clinicians can consider transitioning patients without contraindications to a comparable dose of a longer-acting BZD medication for the taper, should monitor for the emergence of BZD withdrawal signs and symptoms with each dose reduction and, if significant signs or symptoms emerge, the taper should be slowed or paused, and because some patients experience significant withdrawal symptoms even with gradual tapering, they should be offered slower tapering as needed, with some cases allowing maintenance on a lower dose if this reduces current risks such that they no longer outweigh the benefits. Clinicians should consider adjunctive psychosocial interventions as part of the comprehensive BZD tapering strategy, including evidence-based interventions for BZD discontinuation such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I); they should provide concurrent treatment for any co-occurring physical health conditions and psychiatric disorders, including substance use disorders (SUDs); and should employ harm reduction strategies such as providing opioid overdose reversal medication (e.g., naloxone) to those concomitantly taking opioids or otherwise at risk of opioid overdose, connecting patients to local resources, and providing patient education based on each individual patient's risks. It may take months to years to fully taper off BZDs, particularly if patients have been taking a high dose for an extended period of time.

### Deprescribing benzodiazepine receptor agonists for insomnia in adults… [^147e56c6]. AAFP (2019). Medium credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- A slow taper of BZRAs is recommended in patients 18 to 64 years of age who use these most days of the week for more than four weeks.
- Patients 65 years and older taking a BZRA for any duration should be recommended to taper off slowly.
- A slow taper with a 25% dose reduction every two weeks and medication-free days at the end of the taper is suggested. CBT combined with tapering improved BZRA cessation when compared with tapering alone. CBT for insomnia includes education regarding sleep, regulating stimulation, limiting sleep, sleep hygiene, and relaxation, and is associated with improved sleep and long-term benefits. Tapering should be recommended to all patients taking BZRAs. Harms, waning effectiveness, rate and length of tapering, monitoring, and the possibility of withdrawal symptoms should be discussed.

Based on low-quality evidence, patients 18 to 64 years of age who use BZRAs most days of the week for longer than four weeks and patients 65 years and older taking a BZRA for any duration should have dosing tapered slowly. Figure 1 is an algorithm for deprescribing BZRAs. It should be noted that switching to a long-acting BZRA does not improve cessation rates or reduce withdrawal symptoms compared with tapering short-acting BZRAs. Although the systematic review did not compare different tapering schedules, a very slow taper with a 25% dose reduction every two weeks and medication-free days at the end was used in several trials. Options include 50% reduction and switching to lorazepam or oxazepem during final tapering if the patient's current dosage does not allow tapering in 25% increments.

Various behavioral management strategies may be considered for patients who experience a recurrence of insomnia during attempts to taper BZRAs. In the primary care setting, these strategies include recommending that the patient go to bed only when tired; use the bed only for sleep or intimacy; leave the bed if not asleep within 30 minutes, even if awakened in the night one or more times; maintain consistency in waking up at the same time every day; avoid naps; avoid consuming caffeine in the afternoon; and avoid physical activity, nicotine, alcohol, and eating a large amount of food two hours before going to bed.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^b652617c]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Implementation Considerations
When considering the risks and benefits of continued BZD prescribing, clinicians should screen patients for non-prescription use of BZDs and use of other substances that may interact with BZDs or impact the tapering process.
When the risks of BZD medication outweigh the benefits, clinicians should initiate a conversation with patients about tapering (or discontinuation if patients are unlikely to be physically dependent). Clinicians should elicit information from patients about their expectations and concerns about the tapering process and discuss them. Clinicians should discuss alternatives for managing the underlying condition(s) for which the BZD was initially prescribed that may be more effective and carry less risk compared to BZDs (e.g. selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and/or CBT for anxiety disorders, CBT-I for primary insomnia).
The goal of tapering may be discontinuing the BZD medication or reducing the BZD dose to the lowest effective dose where the risks no longer outweigh the benefits. Clinicians should reassess risks and benefits throughout the tapering process to inform decision-making.
Although many patients who have been taking BZDs for a short period of time (e.g. less than a month) are able to discontinue the medication without a taper, clinicians can consider a short taper. A short taper may be indicated if clinicians have concerns for clinically significant withdrawal (e.g. due to the pharmacological properties of the BZD, patient age, comorbidities, other substance use, prior history of withdrawal) or patients express concerns about discontinuing the medication.
Many healthcare systems may not be able to manage the volume of patients who would benefit from BZD tapering. As such, clinicians and healthcare systems may need to triage patients, prioritizing those at higher risk of harm related to continued BZD use. See " Implementing this Guideline " for further discussion.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^456dc6d2]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Some available guidance points to the availability of liquid formulations for some BZD medications (e.g. diazepam oral solution concentrate) and the use of compounding pharmacies for custom dosage tablets. However, these options come with a higher cost, and not all patients have access to them. In addition, measuring out liquid doses can be challenging for some patients. These strategies are discussed in detail in The Maudsley Deprescribing Guidelines. See Appendix 7 for resources on managing challenging dosage reductions with available formulations.

Patients who have been taking lower doses of BZDs for shorter periods of time may desire or be able to taper from the medication more quickly than recommended in this Guideline. Clinicians can reasonably consider if a faster taper may be indicated or if a taper is necessary for patients whose presentation and history suggest a low risk of significant physical dependence and withdrawal.

Clinicians should also consider patients' underlying conditions or symptoms for which BZDs are being used to manage when developing tapering strategies. For example, if BZDs have been used to manage anxiety with insomnia, clinicians can recommend tapering the morning dose first. See Appendix 3 for case descriptions and associated sample tapering strategies.

The CGC emphasized that clinicians should engage patients as active partners in a shared decision-making approach to develop and dynamically adjust individualized tapering strategies that reflect a given patient's goals, needs, and preferences. The FDA also underscored the importance of developing individualized tapering strategies in a 2020 Drug Safety Communication (2):

To reduce the risk of acute withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to reduce the dosage or to discontinue benzodiazepines. No standard benzodiazepine tapering schedule is suitable for all patients; therefore, create a patient-specific plan to gradually reduce the dosage, and ensure ongoing monitoring and support as needed to avoid serious withdrawal symptoms or worsening the patient's medical condition.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^15b44cfb]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Despite potential harms, long-term use of BZDs (i.e. ≥ 120 days) is common. Long-term BZD use is associated with an increased risk of physical dependence and withdrawal and ongoing risk of adverse events such as falls, motor vehicle accidents, and cognitive impairment.– Evidence also suggests that use of BZDs is associated with increased suicide risk, although the mechanism for this association is not well understood. The risk–benefit balance for continued BZD use may shift over time, and stopping can be challenging because physical dependence develops with regular use. It should be noted that physical dependence is an expected outcome associated with the use of prescribed BZDs and is distinct from substance use disorders (SUDs; see Box 1). Older adults (i.e. ≥ 65 years old) have the highest BZD prescription rates and are at higher risk of experiencing adverse events related to BZD use. Some older adults have taken BZDs continuously for decades. In some instances, use has been so prolonged that the original reason for the BZD prescription may be unclear.

Box 1
Physical Dependence Versus Substance Use Disorder

Safe tapering of BZDs can be clinically complex because rapid dosage reductions may precipitate acute withdrawal, which can be life-threatening. Patients are also at risk of recurrence and exacerbation of the symptoms for which BZDs were initially prescribed (e.g. anxiety, seizures, insomnia) and destabilization. This Guideline was motivated, in part, by patients reporting harms associated with too rapid tapering/discontinuation of BZD medications. Inadequate tapering strategies may push patients to the illegal drug market, where counterfeit pills laced with fentanyl and other highly potent synthetic opioids (HPSOs) are common, presenting an increased risk of overdose and overdose death. This Guideline aims to help clinicians in diverse practice settings determine whether and how to taper BZD medications.

Intersection with the Opioid Overdose Epidemic

Co-prescribing of BZDs and opioids quadrupled between 2003 and 2015 in ambulatory care settings, with data from 2014 to 2016 indicating over one-third of BZD prescriptions were co-prescribed with opioids. In addition, some individuals may concomitantly take BZDs and opioids to augment the effects of both substances.

Given that both BZDs and opioids cause CNS depression, concomitant use increases the risk of adverse events, including fatal and nonfatal overdose. – In 2021, 13.7% of overdose deaths in the USA involving opioids also involved BZDs, and nearly 88% of overdose deaths involving BZDs also involved opioids.

CONSIDERATIONS FOR TAPERING BENZODIAZEPINES

Determining Whether to Taper

Recommendations for Considerations for Tapering Benzodiazepines
Clinicians should ideally assess the risks and benefits of ongoing BZD prescribing at least every 3 months for each patient taking BZD medications (see Tables 2 and 3; Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation). a At a minimum, clinicians should assess the risks and benefits with each new BZD prescription or BZD prescription renewal (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation). b Clinicians should review the information in the relevant prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMPs) as part of the risk–benefit assessment (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation).
Clinicians should consider discontinuation or a short taper for patients who are unlikely to be physically dependent when the risks of BZD medication outweigh the benefits (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation). Tapering is indicated for patients who are likely to be physically dependent when the risks of BZD medication outweigh the benefits (Low Certainty, Strong Recommendation). Clinicians should consider discontinuation or a short taper for patients who are unlikely to be physically dependent when the risks of BZD medication outweigh the benefits (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation).
If the BZD medication is discontinued without a taper in patients who are unlikely to be physically dependent, clinicians should counsel patients to report the emergence of withdrawal and/or rebound symptoms (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation). a If significant symptoms emerge, clinicians can consider using medications for symptom management or restarting the BZD medication and initiating a taper (Clinical Consensus, Conditional Recommendation).

### Supporting patients through benzodiazepine tapering: a new joint clinical practice guideline [^e8e5d907]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Benzodiazepines are often prescribed for a variety of indications, including anxiety and sleep disorders. Although available clinical guidelines generally recommend avoiding the use of benzodiazepines for more than 4 weeks, long-term use is common.

The effectiveness of benzodiazepine medications may decrease over time as tolerance develops, but risks persist or, in the case of physical dependence and withdrawal, increase over time. While there are some limited indications for longer-term use, such as treatment-resistant anxiety or certain sleep disorders, particularly those associated with abnormal movement, for many patients, the risks may quickly begin to outweigh the benefits.

Tapering benzodiazepines can be very challenging, and clinicians across specialties often struggle to help patients reduce the dose or discontinue benzodiazepines without compromising the patient's wellness or quality of life. It can be particularly difficult in the primary care setting, which has limited capacity for ongoing patient monitoring or providing additional support, such as case management or behavioral treatment. Lack of clear guidance on when to consider tapering and how to approach it has only compounded this issue, limiting some clinicians' willingness to take on this challenge. Far too often, these combined factors have led to inertia, with patients maintained on benzodiazepine medications long after they stop providing a clinical benefit or begin contributing to harm.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^b970d712]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Benzodiazepine tapering strategies — recommendations for the tapering process specify initial dose-reduction pacing, optional transition to longer-acting medication, individualized adjustments, and monitoring. Clinicians should generally consider dose reductions of 5 to 10% when determining the initial pace of the BZD taper, and the pace of the taper should typically not exceed 25% every 2 weeks (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation). Clinicians can consider transitioning patients without contraindications to a comparable dose of a longer-acting BZD medication for the taper (Clinical Consensus, Conditional Recommendation). Clinicians should tailor tapering strategies to each individual patient and adjust the taper based on a patient's response (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation). Clinicians should evaluate patients undergoing tapering for signs and symptoms related to the BZD taper with each dose reduction (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation).

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^c19b046e]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Although many patients who have been taking BZDs for a short period of time (e.g. less than a month) are able to discontinue the medication without a taper, some will experience significant withdrawal symptoms. Similarly, some patients who have been taking BZDs at a low dose for an intermediate amount of time (e.g. 6 weeks) may not be physically dependent. Defining strict thresholds for the risk of physical dependence and withdrawal is difficult because many factors beyond the dose and duration of BZD use impact risk, including age, co-occurring physical and mental health conditions, the pharmacological properties of the given BZD, other medication and substance use, and prior history of withdrawal, among others.

Table 3 summarizes the risk of withdrawal by dose, duration, and frequency of BZD use. While no direct evidence was found for predicting risk of withdrawal, the CGC agreed that these factors were most salient in the determination. Clinicians should consider this information in the context of each patient's presentation when determining if patients are likely to be physically dependent and tapering is indicated. It should be noted that alprazolam — which is unique in having a very short half-life, rapid onset of action, and no active metabolites — tends to be associated with a more rapid onset of physical dependence. Therefore, a taper may be appropriate for patients taking this medication daily, even for a short duration (e.g. 2–4 weeks).

If physical dependence is difficult to determine, clinicians should elicit information from patients regarding any concerns about discontinuation or preferences for tapering. Clinicians should gather information about each patient's likelihood for physical dependence and risk of withdrawal, including asking if they have experienced withdrawal symptoms following missed doses in the past. Clinicians should also ask patients about any past experiences with withdrawal symptoms associated with tapering or discontinuing BZDs, especially adverse events such as seizures. Determining use of alcohol is also important, particularly if patients engage in ongoing daily alcohol use or have experienced severe withdrawal from alcohol or other substances in the past; slower and/or alternate tapering strategies may be indicated in these situations. If SUD may be present, clinicians should consider consulting addiction specialists, when possible.

If physical dependence is unlikely and the decision is made to discontinue the BZD without a taper, clinicians should educate patients about potential withdrawal and/or rebound symptoms that may occur and encourage patients to report these symptoms. If patients report significant symptoms, clinicians can consider initiating a taper.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^6a5d96f9]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Benzodiazepine (BZD) tapering — dose reduction strategies and pacing specify that clinicians should proactively consider smaller dose reductions and/or slowing the pace of dose reductions as the taper progresses. If patients are unable to tolerate further BZD dose reductions, clinicians can consider maintaining patients on the lower BZD dose with regular risk–benefit assessments consistent with Recommendation 1, and in some limited instances when patients are experiencing intolerable symptoms, returning to the prior BZD dose and pausing the taper until symptoms stabilize may be appropriate. In limited instances when necessary for patient safety, inpatient and medically managed residential settings may use more rapid tapering strategies. Clinical trials evaluating BZD tapering strategies typically used relatively fast schedules (e.g., 25% every 1–2 weeks) with inflexible dose reductions and often had high patient dropout. Recommended BZD dose reductions can target a goal of reducing the BZD by 20% over 4 weeks using options such as reducing the BZD dose by 5% per week, by 10% every other week, by 20% and maintaining at that lower dose for 4 weeks, or reducing the number of pills consumed (for example, for a 5 mg diazepam twice daily prescription, reducing pills from 60 to 48 for 4 weeks). Smaller, consistent dose reductions may be best for patients who are experiencing significant withdrawal symptoms, while providing patients with options can help increase patient buy-in and agency in the tapering process.

Adjunctive interventions during benzodiazepine tapering — clinicians should offer patients undergoing BZD tapering behavioral interventions tailored to their underlying conditions or provide them with referrals to access these interventions (Low Certainty, Strong Recommendation), and clinicians should first consider pausing or slowing the pace of the BZD taper when symptoms significantly interfere with the taper; however, clinicians can also consider use of adjunctive medications (Clinical Consensus, Conditional Recommendation).

### Supporting patients through benzodiazepine tapering: a new joint clinical practice guideline [^886bddd6]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

As we saw after the release of the CDC Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain in 2016, Guidelines can have unintended consequences. There may be a large population of patients for whom benzodiazepine tapering is indicated. Clinicians should prioritize those who are at the highest risk of harm. Benzodiazepine medications should not be abruptly discontinued in patients who are physically dependent. Alternative strategies for managing benzodiazepine withdrawal risk (e.g. tapering with very long-acting agents) may be used when there are compelling reasons for more rapid taper or discontinuation and are also discussed in the Guideline. This Guideline should not be used as a reason to abandon patients who require a benzodiazepine taper or continued long-term benzodiazepine therapy.

While considerations for initiating benzodiazepine were outside of the scope of this Guideline, it is clear we need to think carefully about when to start these medications and particularly when to continue with subsequent prescriptions. It is critical that we educate patients on these risks at the outset to support truly informed consent.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^c538e993]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Rationale

There is significant heterogeneity in patient response to BZD tapering. In the CGC's experience, some patients who have been taking moderate BZD doses for months experience minimal challenges when tapering at a rate of 10 to 25% every 4 weeks. Other patients — even some who have been taking low BZD doses for a relatively short time (e.g. weeks) — may experience significant withdrawal symptoms, even when tapering at a slower rate. Clinical trials evaluating BZD tapering strategies, which typically have relatively fast (e.g. 25% every 1–2 weeks) and inflexible dose reduction schedules, often have high patient dropout. – While no direct evidence was found comparing various tapering strategies, the CGC considered results of these studies, existing guidance, and their own experience in recommending these tapering strategies.

Recommended BZD dose reductions can be achieved in many ways. For example, a goal of reducing the BZD by 20% over 4 weeks could be achieved by any of the following or a combination of the following strategies:
Reducing the BZD dose by 5% per week
Reducing the BZD dose by 10% every other week
Reducing the BZD dose by 20% and maintaining at that lower dose for 4 weeks
Reducing the number of pills consumed — as an example, clinicians could reduce the number of pills for a 5 mg diazepam twice daily prescription from 60 to 48 for 4 weeks, and patients can decide which pills to skip and when

Smaller, consistent dose reductions may be best for patients who are experiencing significant withdrawal symptoms. However, providing patients with options can help increase patient buy-in and agency in the tapering process.

### Masked taper with behavioral intervention for discontinuation of benzodiazepine receptor agonists: a randomized clinical trial [^8ebf20e7]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Placebo effects are commonly observed in benzodiazepine receptor agonist hypnotic clinical trials. Clinical guidelines recommend discontinuing benzodiazepine receptor agonist hypnotics (particularly in older adults) and administering cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTI) as first-line therapy for insomnia. It is unknown whether a novel intervention that masks the daily dose of benzodiazepine receptor agonist during tapering and augments CBTI with novel cognitive and behavioral exercises targeting placebo effect mechanisms improves benzodiazepine receptor agonist discontinuation.

Objective

To compare a masked benzodiazepine receptor agonist taper plus augmented CBTI vs an unmasked taper plus standard CBTI.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This randomized clinical trial conducted at an academic medical center and a Department of Veterans Affairs medical center included adults aged 55 years or older who had used lorazepam, alprazolam, clonazepam, temazepam, and/or zolpidem for current or prior insomnia, at doses of less than 8-mg diazepam-equivalent 2 or more nights per week for at least 3 months. Data were collected between December 2018 and November 2023. Data analyses were conducted between November 2023 and July 2024.

Interventions

Masked taper plus cognitive behavioral therapy-augmented program (MTcap); standard CBTI plus supervised (unmasked) gradual taper (SGT).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary efficacy outcome was percentage achieving benzodiazepine receptor agonist discontinuation 6 months after treatment ended (6-month; intention-to-treat) measured with 7-day self-reported medication logs and for a subset, urine tests. Secondary outcomes were Insomnia Severity Index scores at 1 week posttreatment and 6 months posttreatment, percentage of participants that have discontinued benzodiazepine receptor agonist use at 1 week posttreatment, and benzodiazepine receptor agonist dose and the Dysfunctional Beliefs About Sleep-Medication subscale at 1 week and 6 months posttreatment.

Results

Of 338 participants who underwent in-depth screening, 188 participants (mean [SD] age, 69.8 [8.3] years, 123 male [65.4%] and 65 female [35.6%]) were randomly assigned to MTcap (n = 92) or SGT (n = 96). Compared with SGT, MTcap resulted in greater benzodiazepine receptor agonist discontinuation at 6 months (MTcap = 64 [73.4%], SGT = 52 [58.6%]; odds ratio [OR], 1.95; 95% CI 1.03–3.70; P = 0.04) and 1 week posttreatment (MTcap = 76 [88.4%], SGT = 62 [67.4%]; OR, 3.68; 95% CI, 1.67–8.12; P = 0.001) and reduced frequency of benzodiazepine receptor agonist use (nights/week) at 1 week posttreatment (-1.31; 95% CI, -2.05 to -0.57; P < .001). Insomnia Severity Index improved with no significant between-group difference at follow-up (baseline to 1 week posttreatment, 1.38; P = 0.16; baseline to 6 months, 0.16; P = 0.88).

Conclusions and Relevance

This randomized clinical trial found that a program combining masked tapering with novel cognitive and behavioral exercises targeting placebo mechanisms improved the percentage of long-term benzodiazepine receptor agonist discontinuation compared with standard CBTI plus an unmasked taper.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^13e11895]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Benzodiazepine tapering — implementation considerations: When considering the risks and benefits of continued BZD prescribing, clinicians should screen patients for non-prescription use of BZDs and use of other substances that may interact with BZDs or impact the tapering process. When the risks of BZD medication outweigh the benefits, clinicians should initiate a conversation with patients about tapering (or discontinuation if patients are unlikely to be physically dependent) and discuss alternatives for managing the underlying condition(s) that may be more effective and carry less risk (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and/or CBT for anxiety disorders, CBT-I for primary insomnia). The goal of tapering may be discontinuing the BZD medication or reducing the BZD dose to the lowest effective dose where the risks no longer outweigh the benefits.

### Intractable nausea caused by zolpidem withdrawal: a case report [^5755277d]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

First launched in France in 1988, zolpidem (Ambien®) is a short-acting hypnotic agent. Early studies reported that that the development of physical dependence and tolerance to sedative-hypnotic drugs, such as the depressant and anticonvulsant effects evidenced with benzodiazepines, is not found with zolpidem. Direct to consumer advertising by the manufacturer continues to state that the risk for dependency is low; however, recent publications seem to contradict this. Additionally, adverse drug reactions affecting the central nervous system, gastrointestinal tract, and respiratory system have been reported. Other studies have examined the interactions of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and zolpidem as a possible cause of hallucinations. With continued physician marketing efforts touting the safety and efficacy of zolpidem, there is a high likelihood to overlook the risk of dependency and the symptoms related to zolpidem withdrawal. We report a case of a 41-year-old female who developed a dependency to zolpidem, who on her own decided to decrease her dosage, resulting in intractable nausea requiring hospitalization. Reported cases of zolpidem withdrawal have occurred with doses in excess of 160 mg per day, none of these have reported with intractable nausea as the sole symptom. In our reported case, although exceeding recommended dosage withdrawal phenomenon seemed to be severe after withdrawal from a comparatively low dose of zolpidem. Before zolpidem is prescribed, patient education should include warnings about the potential problems associated with dependency and abrupt discontinuation. Education about this common and likely underrecognized clinical phenomenon will help prevent future episodes and minimize the risk of misdiagnosis.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^05fd2368]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Safety concerns for inherited patients — assumption of prescribing, referrals, and non-abandonment indicate that clinicians sometimes inherit patients who have been prescribed high-dose and/or long-term BZDs. Clinicians can attempt to consult with prior prescribers and other relevant physical and mental health providers, and clinicians should follow the recommendations in this Guideline when assuming responsibility for new patients, including assessing the risks and benefits of continued BZD prescribing. Patients may require extra time to understand the rationale behind a recommendation for tapering and buy into the tapering plan. If clinicians are not comfortable assuming responsibility for these prescriptions, they can consider referring these patients to another provider or a more intensive level of care, as appropriate, with a bridging prescription to prevent abrupt discontinuation of the BZD medication. It is critical that patients at risk of BZD withdrawal are not abandoned, and alternatively, clinicians may consider initiating a taper without patient agreement.

### Zolpidem tartrate (zolpidem) [^4c88419e]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Dosage in Adults

Use the lowest effective dose for the patient. The recommended initial dose is 5 mg for women and either 5 or 10 mg for men, taken only once per night immediately before bedtime with at least 7–8 hours remaining before the planned time of awakening. If the 5 mg dose is not effective, the dose can be increased to 10 mg. In some patients, the higher morning blood levels following use of the 10 mg dose increase the risk of next-day impairment of driving and other activities that require full alertness [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. The total dose of Zolpidem Tartrate Tablets should not exceed 10 mg once daily immediately before bedtime. Zolpidem Tartrate Tablets should be taken as a single dose and should not be readministered during the same night.

The recommended initial doses for women and men are different because Zolpidem clearance is lower in women.

Long-term use of Zolpidem Tartrate Tablets is not recommended. Treatment should be as short as possible. Extended treatment should not take place without re-evaluation of the patient's status because the risk of abuse and dependence increase with the duration of treatment [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3)]

2.2 Special Populations

Elderly or debilitated patients may be especially sensitive to the effects of Zolpidem tartrate. The recommended dose of Zolpidem Tartrate Tablets in these patients is 5 mg once daily immediately before bedtime [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.5)].

Patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment do not clear the drug as rapidly as normal subjects. The recommended dose of Zolpidem Tartrate Tablets in these patients is 5 mg once daily immediately before bedtime. Avoid Zolpidem Tartrate Tablets use in patients with severe hepatic impairment as it may contribute to encephalopathy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8), Use in Specific Populations (8.7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

2.3 Use with CNS Depressants

Dosage adjustment may be necessary when Zolpidem Tartrate Tablets is combined with other CNS-depressant drugs because of the potentially additive effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.7)].

2.4 Administration

The effect of Zolpidem Tartrate Tablets may be slowed by ingestion with or immediately after a meal.

See FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).

Inform patients and their families about the benefits and risks of treatment with Edluar. Inform patients of the availability of a Medication Guide and instruct them to read the Medication Guide prior to initiating treatment with Edluar and with each prescription refill. Review the Edluar Medication Guide with every patient prior to initiation of treatment. Instruct patients or caregivers that Edluar should be taken only as prescribed.

Complex Sleep Behaviors

Instruct patients and their families that Edluar may cause complex sleep behaviors, including sleep-walking, sleep-driving, preparing and eating food, making phone calls, or having sex while not being fully awake. Serious injuries and death have occurred during complex sleep behavior episodes. Tell patients to discontinue Edluar and notify their healthcare provider immediately if they develop any of these symptoms [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

CNS-depressant Effects and Next-Day Impairment

Tell patients that Edluar has the potential to cause next-day impairment, and that this risk is increased if dosing instructions are not carefully followed. Tell patients to wait for at least 8 hours after dosing before driving or engaging in other activities requiring full mental alertness. Inform patients that impairment can be present despite feeling fully awake. Advise patients that increased drowsiness and decreased consciousness may increase the risk of falls in some patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

### Current strategies for tapering psychiatric drugs: differing recommendations, impractical doses, and other barriers [^6e70009b]. Psychiatry Research (2023). Medium credibility.

While effective ways to prevent withdrawal symptoms from psychiatric drugs remain unclear, a highly accepted clinical approach for treatment discontinuation is to gradually reduce doses over time. The objective of this review is to gather the current strategies for tapering of psychiatric drugs described in the literature and guidelines in an attempt to identify the most promising one. Literature review and search for practice guidelines provided by government agencies and medical organizations were performed. Different strategies for tapering were found: linear tapering, hyperbolic tapering (by exponential dose reduction and pre-established dose-response curves), extended dosing, and substitution for a long half-life drug. The use of guidelines offers support for patients and prescribers, increasing the likelihood of achieving effective drug discontinuation. Nevertheless, the lack of standardization found among the guidelines makes any attempt to reduce or stop the drug very difficult for prescribers. Hyperbolic tapering by exponential dose reduction appears to be the most promising strategy for psychiatric drug discontinuation. Yet, we still face a constant challenge: how to safely obtain flexible doses for the discontinuation of drugs, particularly during the last steps in which lower doses are required. Further studies are needed to reduce the barriers associated with psychiatric drug discontinuation.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^44267ac5]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Key Takeaways

This Guideline aims to assist clinicians in helping patients who have developed physical dependence safely taper BZDs while minimizing withdrawal symptoms and associated risks. The recommendations in this Guideline address considerations for tapering, level of care, tapering strategies, withdrawal management, and specific patient populations.

Due to the paucity of evidence addressing BZD tapering strategies, the majority of the recommendations in this Guideline are based on clinical consensus. Three recommendation statements are based on low-quality evidence from ten studies (see " Summary of Recommendations ").

The following are ten key takeaways of this Guideline for adult patients who have been taking BZDs regularly and may be at risk of physical dependence:
Clinicians should base clinical recommendations regarding continued BZD prescribing on ongoing assessment of the risks and benefits of continued BZD use as well as those of tapering/discontinuation (see Table 2). Tapering is generally indicated when the risks of continuing BZD medication outweigh the benefits. Clinicians should conduct more frequent risk–benefit assessments of continued BZD prescribing for patients who: i. Are concomitantly taking opioid medication ii. Have an SUD iii. Have additional risk factors for adverse effects, such as co-occurring physical conditions (e.g. obstructive sleep apnea) or mental health conditions (e.g. bipolar spectrum disorder) Clinicians should use caution if utilizing urine drug screen immunoassays for BZDs due to known limitations. Clinicians should consider the maternal–fetal dyad when assessing the risks and benefits of continued BZD prescribing in patients who are pregnant. Clinicians should taper BZDs in most older adults (i.e. ≥ 65 years) unless there are compelling reasons for continuation.
Clinicians should consider approaches to BZD tapering in collaboration with patients and their care partners utilizing shared decision-making strategies.
Clinicians should not discontinue BZDs abruptly in patients who are likely to be physically dependent and at risk of withdrawal symptoms (see Recommendation 2 " Rationale " and associated evidence summary). Physical dependence can develop within weeks and is heterogeneous across patients(see Table 3).
Although most patients can complete BZD tapering in outpatient settings, clinicians should consider inpatient or medically managed residential care when patient presentation indicates significant risk that cannot be safely managed in outpatient care.
Clinicians should design the tapering strategy to minimize harms from both continued BZD use and the tapering process, such as withdrawal symptoms and recurrence of symptoms for which the BZD was originally prescribed. The initial pace of the BZD taper should generally include dose reductions of 5 to 10% every 2–4 weeks. The taper should typically not exceed 25% every 2 weeks. Patients who have been taking lower doses for a relatively short period of time (e.g. < 3 months) may be able to taper more quickly. The goal of tapering may be discontinuing the BZD medication or reducing the BZD dose to the point where the risks no longer outweigh the benefits.
Clinicians should tailor tapering strategies to each individual patient and adjust tapering based on patient response. Clinicians can consider transitioning patients without contraindications to a comparable dose of a longer-acting BZD medication for the taper (see Appendix B). Clinicians should monitor patients for the emergence of BZD withdrawal signs and symptoms with each dose reduction. If significant signs or symptoms emerge, the taper should be slowed or paused. Some patients experience significant withdrawal symptoms, even with gradual tapering, and should be offered slower tapering as needed. In some cases, maintaining a patient on a lower dose may be sufficient to reduce the current risks such that they no longer outweigh the benefits.
Clinicians should offer patients undergoing BZD tapering adjunctive psychosocial interventions (e.g. cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I)) to support successful tapering (see Recommendation 10 " Rationale" and associated evidence summary).
Clinicians should provide concurrent treatment for any co-occurring physical health conditions and psychiatric disorders, including SUDs, that could interfere with the BZD taper.
Clinicians should employ harm reduction strategies — such as providing opioid overdose reversal medication (e.g. naloxone) to those concomitantly taking opioids or otherwise at risk of opioid overdose, connecting patients to local resources, and providing patient education — based on each individual patient's risks.
It may take months to years to fully taper off BZDs, particularly if patients have been taking a high dose for an extended period of time.

Substance use disorder (SUD) and unregulated benzodiazepine exposure management indicates that some patients with SUD may report nonmedical use of prescribed BZDs or use of nonprescribed BZDs, making daily dose determination difficult; the CGC recommends that clinicians refer these patients for assessment of potential SUD, and unless contraindicated, these patients should typically be transitioned to a long-acting agent due to the uncertainty regarding the strength of the BZDs they are taking.

Adjusting the Taper Strategy

Tapering often does not proceed at the same pace over the entire process; rather, pacing should be flexibly adjusted based on patient response. Although clinicians and patients can prepare for the BZD tapering process by setting realistic expectations around the potential withdrawal and/or rebound symptoms a given patient may be likely to experience, accurately predicting the extent and severity of symptoms that may manifest once tapering is underway is difficult. For this reason, clinicians should monitor patients for signs and symptoms of withdrawal with each dose reduction and counsel them to report any concerning symptoms. Clinicians should discuss this inherent uncertainty with patients so that, together, they can adjust planned tapering strategies as necessary.

Some patients may interpret the emergence of symptoms as evidence that BZD medication is necessary to manage their underlying condition. Clinicians should help patients understand that these symptoms commonly reflect physical dependence. Chronic BZD use leads to changes in BZD receptor expression and response. As the BZD dose is reduced, the BZD receptors slowly adjust. Symptoms should resolve as the receptors return to homeostasis. Clinicians should reassure patients that tapering strategies can be adjusted to address significant symptoms that may occur.

Symptoms can also reflect the reduction in BZD-induced sedation. For example, patients who are taking high doses of BZDs may have increased sleep duration above their age-appropriate sleep needs. As the BZD is tapered, they may return to age-appropriate sleep needs. Patients may be concerned that this reduced sleep indicates insomnia, but it may instead be evidence of previous oversedation with the BZD.

In general, tapering strategies should be adjusted when patients experience significant symptoms related to the taper. Adjustments could include slowing the pace of the taper, making smaller dose reductions, and/or pausing the taper. The CGC noted that clinicians should generally avoid going back up to a previous dose as this can undermine the goal of resetting BZD receptor levels in the brain. However, if patients are experiencing intolerable symptoms that are not addressed adequately by the above strategies, clinicians can consider resuming the previous dose until patients stabilize and are able to continue with the taper.

Benzodiazepine (BZD) taper — adjunctive medications and protracted withdrawal — emphasizes that "the primary clinical strategy for supporting an effective taper is going slow and adjusting based on the patient's response," with guidance to first pause or slow the taper if symptoms emerge and to minimize polypharmacy; if symptoms persist despite a slower taper, medications may be indicated with specialist consultation. The CGC agreed that "no single medication had enough data to support recommending it." The Patient Panel noted that some with protracted withdrawal have trouble tolerating adjunctive psychoactive medication and that agents "that act directly or indirectly on GABA receptors (e.g. SSRIs, gabapentin, magnesium) can exacerbate and extend the duration of protracted withdrawal symptoms." Clinicians "should first consider whether patients' symptoms are likely to be primarily attributable to BZD withdrawal or underlying conditions," with symptoms that change in parallel with BZD dosage or resolve rapidly after pausing the taper more likely related to BZD withdrawal; distinct neurological or sensory symptoms "may be related to protracted withdrawal," warranting more frequent monitoring and possible specialist consultation. Although evidence for medications to treat BZD withdrawal is lacking, treating underlying conditions can be effective (e.g. SSRIs for GAD); clinicians "should attempt to optimize evidence-based treatment" prior to or, if clinically indicated, concurrent with tapering and "should attempt to minimize the risks of polypharmacy whenever possible" when selecting adjunctive medications.

Integrating SUD treatment with BZD tapering — if tapering is indicated, clinicians should manage the underlying SUD in parallel, should refer to an appropriate level of care, and some SUD programs may take over BZD tapering; patients with OUD should typically be initiated and stabilized on medications for OUD (MOUD) prior to a BZD taper and the MOUD dose should be kept stable; clinicians should provide psychosocial interventions alongside pharmacotherapy; benzodiazepines and other sedative–hypnotics should not be a reason to withhold or suspend methadone or buprenorphine; and monitoring during and after tapering is a key aspect of successful discontinuation with strategies that include ongoing treatment of underlying SUDs and co‑occurring conditions.
