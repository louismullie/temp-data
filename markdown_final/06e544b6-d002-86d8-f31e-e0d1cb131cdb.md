## Question

Are cognitive decline and dementia common consequences of chronic small vessel ischemia in the brain?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether cognitive decline and dementia are common consequences of chronic small vessel ischemia in the brain. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about definitions and scope, including what constitutes chronic small vessel ischemia and how we define cognitive decline and dementia in this context. Then, I should verify the epidemiologic burden and prevalence estimates. Next, I will examine mechanistic plausibility and the cognitive phenotype. After that, I need to review longitudinal and neuropathology data to assess causality and mixed pathology. Finally, I will consider modifiers such as age, sex, and reserve, and synthesize a cautious, clinically useful conclusion with appropriate caveats and references.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entities. Chronic small vessel ischemia in the brain corresponds to cerebral small vessel disease, encompassing arteriolosclerosis, lipohyalinosis, and cerebral amyloid angiopathy, with imaging manifestations including white matter hyperintensities, lacunes, microbleeds, enlarged perivascular spaces, and cortical microinfarcts. These lesions reflect ischemic injury to subcortical white matter and deep gray matter and are highly prevalent with aging and vascular risk factors [^325a1219] [^525b24c0] [^4d7087bd]. I should confirm that the cognitive outcomes span vascular cognitive impairment from mild deficits to vascular dementia, often with a dysexecutive/processing-speed pattern, and frequently overlapping with Alzheimer's disease in mixed pathologies [^6dfeae53] [^cf49abac].

> Next, I should review the epidemiologic burden. Wait, let me verify the magnitude. Multiple high-quality sources indicate that cerebral small vessel disease contributes to roughly 15–45% of all dementia cases, either as pure vascular dementia or mixed with Alzheimer's pathology, and is the leading vascular contributor to cognitive impairment in older adults [^d9eacbbf] [^31b24a6f] [^25a5f583]. I initially thought the estimate might be as high as 45–50% of all dementias, but I should double-check; yes, some summaries cite 45–50%, whereas others frame SVD-related dementia as 15–45% depending on cohorts and definitions, so I will present the range to reflect this heterogeneity [^d9eacbbf] [^25a5f583]. Hold on, I should also note that SVD accounts for about 20–30% of ischemic strokes and is tightly linked to vascular cognitive impairment even without overt stroke, reinforcing its clinical significance beyond stroke syndromes [^5f8deefb] [^91ac9513].

> I will now examine mechanistic plausibility. Chronic small vessel disease disrupts white matter tracts and subcortical–cortical circuits, producing a predilection for impaired processing speed, executive dysfunction, and attention deficits. This profile is consistently observed and mechanistically coherent with the distribution of SVD lesions and network disruption seen on imaging and postmortem studies [^cf49abac] [^fac82d88]. Let me consider additional mechanisms: blood–brain barrier dysfunction, impaired cerebrovascular reactivity, and perivascular clearance failure are implicated and may interact with neurodegenerative processes, suggesting that SVD both directly injures brain tissue and amplifies other pathologies, which helps explain why SVD-related cognitive decline can be progressive even when individual lesions are small [^6f361bb7] [^fa49fd27].

> Next, I should review longitudinal and causal evidence. Long-term cohorts show that baseline SVD burden, especially white matter hyperintensities and lacunes, independently predicts future cognitive decline and dementia, and progression of WMH correlates with worsening cognition over time, supporting a causal contribution rather than mere association [^5bfba791] [^ccf56454]. But wait, what if mixed pathology explains everything? Even in populations with minimal Alzheimer's pathology, cerebrovascular disease alone is associated with higher odds of cognitive impairment and faster decline, indicating that pure vascular cognitive impairment is a real and clinically meaningful entity, albeit frequently coexisting with neurodegeneration in older adults [^ba8f1692]. I should also confirm that incident lacunes and expanding WMH track with executive dysfunction and dementia risk, which is supported by longitudinal neuroimaging studies [^a36893cb] [^21a16539].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about "pure" vascular dementia being the norm. I need to check the extent of mixed pathology. Autopsy and biomarker studies consistently show that most older adults with dementia harbor both vascular and neurodegenerative changes, with SVD frequently coexisting with Alzheimer's disease; this mixed biology lowers the threshold for clinically manifest dementia and accelerates decline, which is why estimates of SVD's contribution vary with how strictly "pure" vascular dementia is defined [^f731c4a5] [^34cf7308]. Let me reconsider the clinical implication: this means SVD is both a direct cause of cognitive decline and a key modifier that worsens expression of other dementias, so its public health impact is larger than implied by "pure VaD" percentages alone [^25a5f583].

> I should confirm the cognitive phenotype and its clinical relevance. The typical pattern in SVD is slowed processing speed, impaired executive function, and reduced attention, with relative sparing of episodic memory early on; however, memory can be affected in more advanced or mixed cases, so I need to avoid overgeneralizing [^cf49abac] [^420a546b]. Let me verify that this profile aligns with imaging: diffusion tensor imaging demonstrates widespread white matter microstructural injury even in normal-appearing white matter, correlating with executive and processing-speed deficits, which reinforces the mechanistic link between SVD and this cognitive signature [^78a28194].

> Next, I should review modifiers that influence risk and expression. Age is the strongest risk factor, with SVD prevalence rising from about 5% at age 50 to near-universality beyond 90, and vascular risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, and smoking amplify both SVD burden and cognitive decline. Female sex may carry higher risk in some analyses, though findings vary and warrant cautious interpretation [^a6dfa3b3] [^6835953c]. I need to ensure I account for cognitive reserve and lesion location: higher educational attainment and premorbid intelligence mitigate clinical expression, while strategic infarcts in frontal white matter and thalamus disproportionately impair executive function and processing speed, explaining variability in symptom severity at similar imaging burdens [^83549522] [^ba8f1692].

> Let me synthesize and answer the question directly. Yes, cognitive decline and dementia are common consequences of chronic small vessel ischemia in the brain. SVD is among the most frequent causes of vascular cognitive impairment and contributes substantially to the global dementia burden, with estimates ranging from roughly 15% to as high as 45–50% depending on definitions and cohorts, and it is the leading vascular mechanism of cognitive decline in older adults [^d9eacbbf] [^25a5f583] [^31b24a6f]. I should double-check that this holds across settings: population-based and clinic-based studies converge on a high attributable burden, and longitudinal data demonstrate that SVD markers predict incident dementia independent of other factors, supporting causality in many cases [^5bfba791] [^ba8f1692].

> Finally, I need to ensure the clinical implications are clear. Because SVD is common, modifiable, and often progresses silently, aggressive control of vascular risk factors — especially blood pressure — is the cornerstone of prevention, and emerging evidence suggests that targeting SVD mechanisms may reduce cognitive decline even if disease-modifying drugs are not yet available. Clinicians should anticipate executive dysfunction and processing-speed slowing in SVD and consider mixed pathology when memory is prominently affected, tailoring assessment and counseling accordingly [^6f309df9] [^00c6795c] [^cf49abac].

Chronic small vessel ischemia in the brain is a **major cause of cognitive decline and dementia** [^91ac9513], accounting for about 15–30% of dementia cases [^f731c4a5] and contributing to many more through mixed pathology [^d9eacbbf]. It causes **subcortical vascular cognitive impairment** [^6dfeae53] with prominent executive dysfunction, slowed processing, and memory deficits, and is strongly linked to white matter hyperintensities, lacunes, and microinfarcts [^a36893cb]. Risk rises with age, hypertension, and diabetes, and progression is common [^21a16539]; however, strict vascular risk control can slow or prevent decline [^6f309df9] [^00c6795c].

## Pathological mechanisms linking chronic small vessel ischemia to cognitive decline

Chronic small vessel ischemia impairs cognition through **multiple mechanisms**:

- **White matter injury**: Demyelination and axonal loss from chronic hypoperfusion disrupt fronto-subcortical circuits, causing executive dysfunction and slowed processing [^9cf8c9dc] [^cf49abac].

- **Lacunar infarcts**: Small subcortical infarcts disrupt strategic pathways, impairing attention, processing speed, and executive function [^a36893cb].

- **Microinfarcts**: Numerous cortical/subcortical microinfarcts, often invisible on MRI, cumulatively damage networks and correlate with dementia risk [^78d4665b].

- **Blood–brain barrier dysfunction**: Endothelial injury and BBB leakage promote neuroinflammation, edema, and protein accumulation, accelerating neurodegeneration [^2aea11cf] [^fa49fd27].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting the association

Robust clinical and epidemiologic data show that chronic small vessel ischemia is a **leading cause of vascular cognitive impairment (VCI)** [^91ac9513] and dementia:

- **Prevalence**: SVD accounts for ~15–30% of dementia cases and contributes to many more via mixed pathology [^f731c4a5] [^d9eacbbf].

- **Cognitive profile**: SVD-related VCI features executive dysfunction, slowed processing, and memory deficits, distinct from Alzheimer's disease [^cf49abac].

- **Progression**: SVD lesions progress over time [^21a16539], with WMH burden and lacunes predicting faster cognitive decline and dementia [^5bfba791] [^ec903881].

- **Mixed pathology**: SVD frequently coexists with Alzheimer's pathology, lowering the threshold for dementia and worsening decline [^34cf7308] [^1de33090].

## Risk factors and predictors of cognitive decline in chronic small vessel ischemia

Several factors **increase the risk and rate of cognitive decline** in SVD:

| **Risk factor** | **Association with cognitive decline** |
|-|-|
| Age | Strongly associated with increased risk and severity of cognitive impairment [^a6dfa3b3] |
| Hypertension | Major risk factor for WMH, lacunes, and cognitive decline [^c8d4461d] [^6f309df9] |
| Diabetes mellitus | Increases risk of SVD and cognitive impairment [^f731c4a5] |
| Smoking | Associated with increased SVD burden and cognitive decline [^8344fe35] |
| Baseline WMH burden | Predicts faster cognitive decline and dementia [^5bfba791] [^ccf56454] |
| Number of lacunar infarcts | Independently predicts cognitive decline and dementia [^ec903881] [^a36893cb] |

---

## Preventive and therapeutic strategies

Given the lack of disease-modifying drugs, **management focuses on vascular risk reduction and supportive care**:

- **Blood pressure control**: Strict hypertension control reduces stroke, WMH progression, and cognitive decline [^6f309df9] [^00c6795c].

- **Lifestyle interventions**: Exercise, diet, smoking cessation, and weight control improve vascular health and may slow cognitive decline [^8344fe35].

- **Antithrombotic therapy**: Not routinely recommended for preventing cognitive decline in SVD without stroke, given limited benefit and bleeding risk [^474fbcef].

- **Cognitive rehabilitation**: May improve executive function and daily living in VCI [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion

Chronic small vessel ischemia in the brain is a **major cause of cognitive decline and dementia**, driven by white matter injury, lacunar infarcts, microinfarcts, and BBB dysfunction. It accounts for a substantial share of dementia cases and often coexists with Alzheimer's pathology. Risk is modifiable, and aggressive vascular risk control can slow or prevent progression, underscoring the need for early detection and intervention.

Cognitive impairment in cerebrovascular diseases

Cerebrovascular diseases include a variety of medical conditions that affect the blood vessels of the brain and the cerebral circulation. These include conditions that may cause acute interruption of cerebral circulation and subsequent acute neuronal damage, such as ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke, and disorders that may cause chronic pathological changes in small vessels and neurological dysfunction, such as cerebral small vessel diseases. Patients with cerebrovascular diseases, both acute and chronic, usually have multidimensional functional impairments to the brain and an increased risk of cognitive impairment and dementia.

Globally, approximately one in four adults will develop stroke in their lifetime from the age of 25 years onwards.Functional impairments to the brain due to stroke vary, but physical disability, aphasia, and dysphagia are common and have received the most attention from stroke specialists to date. However, many patients who survive stroke go on to experience cognitive decline, including vascular cognitive impairment and other dementias, and these aspects have received less attention from either stroke specialists or dementia specialists. This is unfortunate, as incident stroke is associated with an acute decline in cognitive function, especially in global cognition and executive function.The incidence of post-event dementia at one year in patients with the mildest stroke symptoms (that is, transient ischaemic attack and minor stroke) ranges from 5-8% to 19% but may reach more than 34% in those with severe stroke, nearly 50 times higher than in the general population.Cognitive decline also accelerates and persists over many years,and it could be as high as 44% at three years after a minor stroke and be the main factor preventing independence or return to work.

### Association of small vessel disease with tau pathology [^b4555eb7]. Acta Neuropathologica (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) is one of the most common causes of vascular cognitive impairment and dementia. SVD is an umbrella term which refers to the spectrum of pathological changes affecting small vessels (arteries, arterioles, venules, and capillaries), as well as the diverse vascular tissue injuries impacting both gray and white matter structures in the brain. There has been longstanding recognition of vascular dysfunction in multiple neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Alzheimer’s disease. We and others have shown that majority of older persons diagnosed with Alzheimer’s dementia have one or more vascular pathologies, highlighting a central role of cerebrovascular disease in cognitive aging pathogenesis. Complicating matters further, a large proportion of older persons (80%) have co-existing neurodegenerative proteinopathies with vascular pathology, with the most common being AD mixed with vascular pathologic changes. Despite this large burden of comorbidity in the aging brain, the pathobiologic interplay between vascular and neurodegenerative mechanisms remains poorly understood.

Cerebral Aβ plaques and pathologic tau indicate specific neuropathologic changes that define AD pathology. There is a longstanding literature examining the association between SVD with β-amyloid, with more recent studies suggesting a refined relationship between SVD and tau. However, much of the evidence for the latter is derived from animal models, with limited data from human-based studies. One hypothesis suggests that small vessel disease may accelerate the pathological process underlying AD via chronic cerebral hypoperfusion. Notably, cerebral hypoperfusion is a well-established phenotype in patients with AD, a predictor of cognitive decline, and emerging as a candidate biomarker for dementia risk. While it remains unclear whether hypoperfusion in AD is a cause or consequence of disease pathogenesis, accumulating evidence suggests an intertwined relationship between cerebral blood flow, β-amyloid, and tau.

Watershed border zones are located between two or more arterial territories and supplied by the most terminal arterioles in the brain. We and others have shown that these brain regions are particularly vulnerable to hypoperfusion, vasculature changes, and ischemic-tissue injury ; thus, making watershed brain regions ideal to shed light on the role of the vasculature in AD. In this study, we leverage neuropathologic, ex-vivo MRI, and proteomic data to systematically examine the association between SVD and AD pathological changes.

### Update on vascular cognitive impairment associated with subcortical small-vessel disease [^f63078f5]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2018). Low credibility.

INTRODUCTION AND CLASSIFICATION

Since the 17th century, stroke has been recognized as a cause of age-associated cognitive impairment. However, until early in the 20th century, the prevailing concept of age-associated cognitive impairment causation was the impairment of cerebral blood flow (CBF) resulting from partial blockage of the vessels that supply the brain; thus, arteriosclerotic dementia resulting in global brain hypoperfusion was considered the most common form of major cognitive disorder in the elderly. Early neuropathologists recognized subcortical ischemic white matter injury and lacunes as typical lesions resulting from small-vessel disease. During the 1970s, amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles were identified as critical components of the neurodegenerative process occurring in demented elderly patients. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) became recognized as the most common form of major cognitive disorder and the notion of chronic brain ischemia as an explanation of progressive cognitive impairment was abandoned. The claim that vascular disease could lead to cognitive disorders not by means of CBF-related energy deficiency but by repeated stroke episodes resulting in cerebral tissue lesions led to the concept of multi-infarct dementia (MID). Although limited by scarce neuropathological support, the diagnosis of MID grew popular and was applied to a larger group of patients than originally proposed. The demonstration that vascular-related white matter damage (Binswanger disease) contributes to cognitive impairment in the elderly began questioning multiple infarcts as the most important cause of vascular cognitive impairment (VCI). Aging of the population, along with changes in the panorama of cerebrovascular disease (CVD) in terms of reduced stroke mortality, have led to reevaluation and renewal of concepts in this area. Moreover, the role of CVD—particularly small-vessel disease—in the clinical expression and pathogenesis of AD has been increasingly recognized.

### Pre-clinical models of human cerebral small vessel disease: utility for clinical application [^c854d4a9]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2012). Low credibility.

Small vessel disease (SVD) is a frequent cause of vascular cognitive impairment (VCI), encompassing vascular dementia. SVD is characterised by vasculopathy in deep penetrating arteries, diffuse white matter lesions (seen radiologically as leukoaraiosis) and focal, lacunar infarcts. Risk factors are age and hypertension but the pathogenic mechanism is unknown. Recent systematic reviews assessed experimental models of SVD or VCI. Chronically hypertensive animals (e.g. stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats) display some features of SVD vasculopathy, such as vessel wall thickening. White matter lesions are seen in chronic hypoperfusion states (e.g. carotid occlusion/stenosis models). Small focal infarcts are induced by targeted ischemic challenge (surgical occlusion of a small artery, or stereotaxic endothelin-1 injection). Some degree of cognitive impairment is detectable in most cerebrovascular models, probably reflecting the broad neuroanatomical mapping of cognitive function. Important confounds to be considered in animal models of VCI are somatosensory impairment and hippocampal damage. Advances in clinical understanding will come from targeting specific questions on some aspect of SVD (e.g. vasculopathy, white matter damage) to the appropriate model in vivo. In vivo models of SVD are likely to benefit experimental studies of pathological processes, interactions with other brain disease states (such as Alzheimer disease), and therapeutic strategies.

### Cerebral small vessel disease-related dementia: more questions than answers [^f00147c6]. Stroke (2023). Medium credibility.

Cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) has emerged as a common factor driving age-dependent diseases, including stroke and dementia. CSVD-related dementia will affect a growing fraction of the aging population, requiring improved recognition, understanding, and treatments. This review describes evolving criteria and imaging biomarkers for the diagnosis of CSVD-related dementia. We describe diagnostic challenges, particularly in the context of mixed pathologies and the absence of highly effective biomarkers for CSVD-related dementia. We review evidence regarding CSVD as a risk factor for developing neurodegenerative disease and potential mechanisms by which CSVD leads to progressive brain injury. Finally, we summarize recent studies on the effects of major classes of cardiovascular medicines relevant to CSVD-related cognitive impairment. Although many key questions remain, the increased attention to CSVD has resulted in a sharper vision for what will be needed to meet the upcoming challenges imposed by this disease.

### New horizons in cognitive and functional impairment as a consequence of cerebral small vessel disease [^cb202a97]. Age and Ageing (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD) is an umbrella term for alterations in the function or structure of the arteriolar, capillary and venular vessels. cSVD frequently occurs in the brain of older persons and can be indirectly visualised on brain imaging through markers such as cerebral white matter hyperintensities (WMH), microbleeds and lacunar infarcts. These vascular alterations are mostly due to a cumulative exposure to detrimental internal and external influences, such as genetic profiles and cardiovascular risk factors. Consequently, cSVD is highly prevalent with ageing, affecting almost all older adults above the age of 90 years. The clinical consequences, however, vary greatly between individuals. When cSVD leads to cognitive impairment, it is labelled part of the spectrum of vascular cognitive impairment (VCI), which ranges in severity from mild cognitive impairment to dementia, and can reflect pure VCI or a mixed phenotype with for example Alzheimer’s disease (AD) or Lewy body pathology. In others, cSVD may lead to mood disorders, stroke or gait disturbances and consequent functional decline. Yet, a large number of individuals with substantial cSVD on brain imaging does not experience symptoms at all. It remains undetermined how and in which stage or form these vascular alterations lead to cognitive and functional deterioration in some persons and not in others, since those with more extensively affected brains are not necessarily the ones with the most clinical symptoms. In this review, we aim to describe the latest developments and new horizons with respect to the diagnosis of cSVD and its implications for cognitive and functional impairment. How can we assess cSVD accurately? How do we identify the contribution of cSVD to cognitive impairment in individual patients? And how do we determine which patients with cSVD have the greatest risk of further cognitive and functional deterioration? In order to discuss these points, we will focus on new horizons in those tools that are already available and used in a standard clinical setting: neuroimaging techniques, neuropsychological assessment and subsequently the potential functional impact of cSVD in older adults with cognitive impairment.

### Microembolism, silent brain infarcts and dementia [^1585cdb0]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2012). Low credibility.

Cognitive decline becomes more prevalent than ever in parallel with the increasing life expectancy of the population. Alzheimer' disease (AD) and cerebral vascular lesions are common in the elderly and represent, with increased age, the most frequent contributors to cognitive decline. It is now believed that these pathologies frequently coexist in the same brain. The border discriminating vascular dementia from AD is blurred and challenges our understanding of these clinical entities. Further research, at both basic and clinical levels, is mandatory in order to better understand the interactions of vascular ischemic injury and primary degenerative physiopathologies of the brain, in order to prevent and better manage patients with cognitive decline. We review recent published clinical evidence of silent brain ischemia as a contributor to cognitive decline and dementia. Microemboli, from both cardiac and vascular origins, have been shown to be associated with structural changes in the brain. The role of transcranial Doppler as an objective tool for detecting and quantifying microemboli is discussed in light of recent clinical evidence.

Figure 1 
The triangle of vascular cognitive impairment due to cSVD.

In addition, a substantial burden of all-cause dementia and depression is attributable to cSVD. Apathy and fatigue are common after stroke and there is increasing evidence that these manifestations are also frequently found in individuals with cSVD. Also delirium is associated with severity of cSVD suggesting that individuals with underlying small vessel disease have more frail brains, in which areas of vascular dysfunction can be more susceptible to acute impairment following systemic inflammatory insults. The awareness that these manifestations are common in patients with cSVD could prompt clinicians to seek out and monitor these symptoms in individuals with cardiovascular risk factors and therefore at risk for cSVD. Eventually, in older adults, a higher burden of cSVD has been associated with frailty and progression of frailty.

Whilst neurodegenerative diseases are chronic and currently incurable, the length of time between diagnosis and complete functional dependency can be many years. Therefore, the assessment of functional status in multimorbid, frail older patients with cSVD is of paramount importance and needs to become an essential component of the comprehensive assessment. Different scales based on interviews with the patient or the caregiver of the patient can be used to objectively measure decline in everyday functional skills, whereas physical performance and mobility skills can be assessed by the short physical performance battery.

### Cerebral small vessel disease: how does it progress? [^662580ed]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2005). Low credibility.

Small vessel disease (SVD), or microangiopathy, of the cerebral white and central grey matter is an important subtype of vascular dementia (VD). SVD-dementia is characterised by a "dysexecutive" type of cognitive impairment, neurological deficits including imbalance and voiding dysfunction, and emotional disturbances. SVD is also frequent among clinically healthy subjects and patients with mild cognitive impairment. It is easily visualised by imaging techniques, but difficult to distinguish from mixed SVD/Alzheimer Disease. SVD has an inherent tendency to progress, but data on its natural course are sparse, and there are almost no drug trials dedicated to it. This article reviews the evidence on the speed and predictors of progression of SVD in regard to cognitive deficits, functional decline and white matter lesions, as derived from epidemiological, clinical and imaging studies and the placebo branches of VD drug trials. Based on the available data, we make suggestions for future research and outcome measures.

### New horizons in cognitive and functional impairment as a consequence of cerebral small vessel disease [^09df99a3]. Age and Ageing (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD) is a frequent finding in imaging of the brain in older adults, especially in the concomitance of cardiovascular disease risk factors. Despite the well-established link between cSVD and (vascular) cognitive impairment (VCI), it remains uncertain how and when these vascular alterations lead to cognitive decline. The extent of acknowledged markers of cSVD is at best modestly associated with the severity of clinical symptoms, but technological advances increasingly allow to identify and quantify the extent and perhaps also the functional impact of cSVD more accurately. This will facilitate a more accurate diagnosis of VCI, against the backdrop of concomitant other neurodegenerative pathology, and help to identify persons with the greatest risk of cognitive and functional deterioration. In this study, we discuss how better assessment of cSVD using refined neuropsychological and comprehensive geriatric assessment as well as modern image analysis techniques may improve diagnosis and possibly the prognosis of VCI. Finally, we discuss new avenues in the treatment of cSVD and outline how these contemporary insights into cSVD can contribute to optimise screening and treatment strategies in older adults with cognitive impairment and multimorbidity.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS

Recent research has taught us that cognitive decline in the elderly is driven by interacting neurodegenerative and vascular pathways, with significant contribution from SVD. Reports of declining incidence of dementia in high-income countries, together with recent positive trials on multifactorial interventions and BP control, are encouraging and highlight the importance of further investigating the impact of vascular risk-factors on cognition. Although there is a challenging path ahead in the quest for disease-modifying interventions, a better understanding of pathological mechanisms underlying SVD could lead to identifying new potential therapeutic targets. Novel neuroimaging markers are promising tools for clinical trials in the field and may act as surrogate markers for cognitive endpoints. As vascular disease is considered the most preventable component of cognitive decline in the elderly, tackling cardiovascular risk-factors remains the cornerstone therapeutic approach.

Neurological Dysfunction

Cerebral microvascular disease

Cerebral small-vessel disease can present clinically as stroke, microinfarct, or a cognitive syndrome.It encompasses a range of vascular pathologies, including arteriosclerosis, small-vessel atheroma, and cerebral amyloid angiopathy,and is the vascular source of cognitive impairment and dementia seen more commonly in women versus men.

Neuropathological and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies suggest that decreased vascular density occurs with aging and Alzheimer's disease, and these changes precede the onset of cognitive dysfunction and neurodegeneration.There is also a decline in cerebrovascular angiogenesis, which may inhibit recovery from hypoxia-induced capillary loss. Cerebral blood flow may then be further inhibited by tortuous arterioles and deposition of excessive collagen in the veins and venules.

Loss of perfusion due to capillary loss appears to precede cell loss in leukoaraiosis, and cerebral blood flow is also reduced in the apparently normal white matter. In patients with Alzheimer's disease, chronic cerebral hypoperfusion and glucose hypometabolism may occur for many decades before cognitive decline is clinically evident. This hypoperfusion may induce white matter lesions, which are commonly seen in brain MRI. Other MRI markers of subclinical vascular brain disease—microinfarcts, microbleeds, demyelinization, and axonal damage—are strongly associated with atherosclerotic calcifications, and are increasingly seen in people with Alzheimer's disease.

Recent data have shown that two-thirds of patients diagnosed with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease are women.The ways in which coronary microvascular disease impacts expression of Alzheimer's disease in women is an area of intense interest. These conditions may share and synergistically activate inflammation that upregulates cerebrovascular pathology through proinflammatory cytokines, ET-1, and NO.

Purpose Of Review

We present recent developments in the field of small vessel disease (SVD)-related vascular cognitive impairment, including pathological mechanisms, updated diagnostic criteria, cognitive profile, neuroimaging markers and risk factors. We further address available management and therapeutic strategies.

Recent Findings

Vascular and neurodegenerative pathologies often co-occur and share similar risk factors. The updated consensus criteria aim to standardize vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) diagnosis, relying strongly on cognitive profile and MRI findings. Aggressive blood pressure control and multidomain lifestyle interventions are associated with decreased risk of cognitive impairment, but disease-modifying treatments are still lacking. Recent research has led to a better understanding of mechanisms leading to SVD-related cognitive decline, such as blood-brain barrier dysfunction, reduced cerebrovascular reactivity and impaired perivascular clearance.

Summary

SVD is the leading cause of VCI and is associated with substantial morbidity. Tackling cardiovascular risk factors is currently the most effective approach to prevent cognitive decline in the elderly. Advanced imaging techniques provide tools for early diagnosis and may play an important role as surrogate markers for cognitive endpoints in clinical trials. Designing and testing disease-modifying interventions for VCI remains a key priority in healthcare.

### Cerebral small vessel disease: from pathogenesis and clinical characteristics to therapeutic challenges [^325a1219]. The Lancet: Neurology (2010). Medium credibility.

The term cerebral small vessel disease refers to a group of pathological processes with various aetiologies that affect the small arteries, arterioles, venules, and capillaries of the brain. Age-related and hypertension-related small vessel diseases and cerebral amyloid angiopathy are the most common forms. The consequences of small vessel disease on the brain parenchyma are mainly lesions located in the subcortical structures such as lacunar infarcts, white matter lesions, large haemorrhages, and microbleeds. Because lacunar infarcts and white matter lesions are easily detected by neuroimaging, whereas small vessels are not, the term small vessel disease is frequently used to describe the parenchyma lesions rather than the underlying small vessel alterations. This classification, however, restricts the definition of small vessel disease to ischaemic lesions and might be misleading. Small vessel disease has an important role in cerebrovascular disease and is a leading cause of cognitive decline and functional loss in the elderly. Small vessel disease should be a main target for preventive and treatment strategies, but all types of presentation and complications should be taken into account.

Cerebrovascular disease (CVD) manifests through a broad spectrum of mechanisms that negatively impact brain and cognitive health. Oftentimes, CVD changes (excluding acute stroke) are insufficiently considered in aging and dementia studies which can lead to an incomplete picture of the etiologies contributing to the burden of cognitive impairment. Our goal with this focused review is 3-fold. First, we provide a research update on the current magnetic resonance imaging methods that can measure CVD lesions as well as early CVD-related brain injury specifically related to small vessel disease. Second, we discuss the clinical implications and relevance of these CVD imaging markers for cognitive decline, incident dementia, and disease progression in Alzheimer disease, and Alzheimer-related dementias. Finally, we present our perspective on the outlook and challenges that remain in the field. With the increased research interest in this area, we believe that reliable CVD imaging biomarkers for aging and dementia studies are on the horizon.

### Incident infarcts in patients with stroke and cerebral small vessel disease: frequency and relation to clinical outcomes [^442c3132]. Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) causes dementia, lacunar stroke, and intracerebral hemorrhage and is associated with other diverse clinical features including neuropsychiatric symptoms, impaired mobility, functional decline, and mortality.Structural SVD features visible on MRI include recent small subcortical infarcts and cortical microinfarcts.Our understanding of SVD mechanisms has advanced recently: SVD lesions can regress and progress, ; evidence for interlesional interactions is growing, ; and wide-ranging vascular impairments are linked to SVD including blood-brain barrier failure,, impaired cerebrovascular reactivity,, and increased intracranial pulsatility. Moreover, preclinical developmentsare establishing the pathophysiologic basis for SVD, and finally, potential treatments are starting to emerge.

To build on these developments, we need better insight into the temporal nature of SVD lesion formation. Most studies have focused on chronic SVD lesion progression, using interscan intervals of 1 or more years,, although a few have described SVD lesion evolution over daysand weeks-monthsin relatively healthy populations. Increased use of MRI diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) in SVD studies has highlighted that small DWI+ve lesions can occur without overt stroke symptoms, and these “incident infarcts” are a growing area of interest.It is not clear how frequently incident infarcts, visible on DWI or other sequences, of which many are clinically “covert,” occur following a stroke, and how these incident infarcts translate to clinical outcomes. Previous studies assessing incident infarcts after stroke,not SVD-specific, have recruited modest-sized populations with minor stroke (n < 100), with most attending 2 follow-up scans. Our understanding of incident infarct etiology, that is, how incident infarct subtype relates to index stroke subtype, for example, lacunar stroke, is limited. Although several studies, using Trial of ORG 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment (TOAST) classification, have suggested that large-vessel index stroke subtypes carry the highest risk of developing incident infarcts,,, data on incident infarct subtypes, and thus index-incident etiologic associations, are rarely reported.Moreover, it is unclear how incident infarcts relate to vascular risk factors, guideline-based secondary prevention, and clinical outcomes.

We aimed to determine the frequency and timing of incident infarcts in the year after a minor lacunar or cortical stroke, to characterize incident infarct subtypes, and to assess how incident infarcts relate to baseline imaging features and vascular risks. Moreover, we aimed to determine whether incident infarcts were associated with recurrent stroke and 1-year cognitive and functional outcomes.

### A new dawn of preventing dementia by preventing cerebrovascular diseases [^d9eacbbf]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Another form of cerebrovascular disease that has received less attention from neurological specialists is chronic damage to the small vessels in the brain. The features of cerebral small vessel diseases seen on brain imaging include lacunas, white matter hyperintensity, and cerebral microbleeds, as well as various other features. A population based study showed that more than 70% of people aged 50 years or older presented with at least one kind of cerebral small vessel disease.Cerebral small vessel disease is not fully understood, but it is associated with chronic damage to small vessels that may lead to blockage or leakage of small vessels in the brain.As the chronic damage accumulates, patients with cerebral small vessel disease can present with acute stroke syndromes, mild cognitive impairment or dementia, gait and balance problems, mood disorders, and urinary incontinence, depending on the location of the lesions.Cerebral small vessel disease is one of the most common causes of vascular dementia and is also frequently found alongside Alzheimer’s disease pathology.Cerebral small vessel disease is estimated to contribute 45-50% of all cases of dementia.

The cognitive consequences of cerebrovascular disease may substantially affect patients’ quality of life and cause a considerable disease burden for patients and their families.Compared with other brain dysfunctions such as movement disorders, cognitive impairment and dementia due to cerebrovascular diseases are neglected by both patients and physicians in all countries, but especially in low income and developing countries such as China.

### Towards defining the neuropathological substrates of vascular dementia [^0dd8fbf0]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2004). Low credibility.

Cerebrovascular disease is highly heterogeneous but can culminate in vascular cognitive impairment or vascular dementia (VaD). As much as the clinical diagnosis warrants scrutiny, the neuropathological substrates of VaD also need to be better defined. Atherosclerosis and small vessel disease are the main causes of brain infarction. Lacunar infarcts or multiple microinfarcts in the basal ganglia, thalamus, brainstem and white matter are associated with more than half of VaD cases consistent with subcortical ischaemic VaD. White matter changes including regions of incomplete infarction are usually widespread in VaD, but their contribution to impairment is not explicit. Other pathologies including hippocampal injury and Alzheimer type of lesions may also modify the course of dementia. Similar to other common dementias consensus criteria for VaD need unambiguous definition to impact on preventative and treatment strategies and are critical for selective recruitment to clinical trials.

### Vascular cognitive impairment [^3e7f2f7b]. Nature Clinical Practice: Neurology (2006). Medium credibility.

Cognitive impairment commonly accompanies clinical syndromes associated with vascular disease of the brain. Because of evolving definitional criteria, however, the frequency of cognitive impairment attributable to cerebrovascular disease is difficult to determine. Dementia occurs in up to one-third of elderly patients with stroke, a subset of whom have Alzheimer's disease (AD) rather than a pure vascular dementia syndrome. In fact, pure vascular dementia has been shown to be uncommon in most large autopsy series. A mixed etiology of AD and cerebrovascular disease is thought to become more common with increasing age, although no clinical criteria for the diagnosis of AD with cerebrovascular disease are currently available. Epidemiological studies have implicated subcortical small-vessel disease as a risk factor for cognitive impairment and dementia, but the cognitive expression and clinical significance of MRI white matter changes in individual patients is difficult to establish. The frequency of specific neuropathologic features of vascular cognitive impairment depends largely on study inclusion criteria. Cerebral meningocortical microangiopathies with distinctive clinicopathological profiles are associated with dementia in both sporadic cases and familial syndromes. In patients with AD, the contribution of amyloid-beta protein to the degree of cognitive impairment has not been clearly defined.

### What is new in vascular dementia? [^ff635dff]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Any damage to the brain may affect cognition. However, although the effects of vascular changes have been known for years, involvement of such changes is becoming increasingly better recognized. In particular the effects of comorbid vascular disease to primary neurodegenerative processes adds to the complexity of the issue. An attempt to clarify the problems needed specific attention to different points, which led to Consensus Reports on several of them.

### New horizons in cognitive and functional impairment as a consequence of cerebral small vessel disease [^78608434]. Age and Ageing (2023). Medium credibility.

Key Points

Currently used tools to quantify the consequences of cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD) still seem insufficient to capture the complete clinical spectrum of vascular cognitive impairment (VCI).
Advances in imaging may improve specificity of cSVD features for underlying aetiology as well as functional consequences.
Assessment of cognitive impairment in cSVD should include novel sensitive and qualitative measures.
The contribution of vascular causes in cognitive deficits should be interpreted in context of imaging and functional markers.
A multidimensional assessment is needed to plan interventions in patients with VCI.

### Cerebral small vessel disease in sporadic and familial Alzheimer disease [^1de33090]. The American Journal of Pathology (2021). Medium credibility.

The most common cause of age-related dementia is the multifactorial Alzheimer disease (AD). Although <5% of biologically defined AD is thought to be familial in nature, even this proportion exhibits high phenotypic variability that can be modified by lifestyle or environmental factors. Late-onset AD is pathologically confirmed by the presence of extracellular amyloid β (Aβ) plaques, intracellular hyperphosphorylated tau, and neuron (or synaptic) loss.Early-onset or familial AD bears similar biological features, although typically, the hallmark pathology accrues considerably before 65 years of age. Clinical AD patients predominantly present with an insidious progressive irreversible amnesia and global cognitive decline in the absence of overt vascular disease. However, numerous post-mortem studies show that vast majority of patients diagnosed with AD dementia invariably have cerebral vascular pathology above and beyond normally aging healthy individuals.Many of the brain vascular changes are attributed to covert or silent cerebral small vessel disease (SVD). SVD features involving intracranial vessels <1 mm in diameter may be acquired subsequent to the initial clinical diagnosis of AD but most likely result from long-standing hypertensive or other vascular disease, or from age-related intracranial microvascular pathology.

Though cerebral SVD independently contributes to morbidity, disability, and mortality, several studies have confirmed that SVD also adds to or modifies progression to dementia such that the threshold for impairment is reached earlier. For example, in the Nun study, SVD type of pathology in the form of lacunar infarcts in the basal ganglia, thalamus, or deep white matter (WM) was described to be associated with a higher prevalence of dementia.The presence of small vessel changes in clinically diagnosed and pathologically confirmed AD is not necessarily denied,but deciphering whether vascular brain injury occurs prior to or concomitantly with neurodegenerative changes, has become a burning issue in AD research.

This review discusses the current evidence of SVD in early- and late-onset AD, and evaluate its contribution in the spectrum of AD. It also appraises whether early-onset AD cases support the proposal that prior vascular dysfunction is part of the biomarker profile of AD. This is timely because it is strikingly clear that reducing brain Aβ overload via any treatment intervention has not had a substantial impact on improving cognition,but lowering the severity or risk of vascular disease seems the worthwhile option to reduce the incidence of AD dementia.

### Mechanisms of sporadic cerebral small vessel disease: insights from neuroimaging [^58fbbd57]. The Lancet: Neurology (2013). Medium credibility.

The term cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) describes a range of neuroimaging, pathological, and associated clinical features. Clinical features range from none, to discrete focal neurological symptoms (eg, stroke), to insidious global neurological dysfunction and dementia. The burden on public health is substantial. The pathogenesis of SVD is largely unknown. Although the pathological processes leading to the arteriolar disease are associated with vascular risk factors and are believed to result from an intrinsic cerebral arteriolar occlusive disease, little is known about how these processes result in brain disease, how SVD lesions contribute to neurological or cognitive symptoms, and the association with risk factors. Pathology often shows end-stage disease, which makes identification of the earliest stages difficult. Neuroimaging provides considerable insights; although the small vessels are not easily seen themselves, the effects of their malfunction on the brain can be tracked with detailed brain imaging. We discuss potential mechanisms, detectable with neuroimaging, that might better fit the available evidence and provide testable hypotheses for future study.

### Cerebral small vessel disease and vascular cognitive impairment: from diagnosis to management [^6dfeae53]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL CLASSIFICATION

Several classification systems have been proposed over the years to guide clinical diagnosis of VCI, reflecting methodological and diagnostic challenges [,–]. When using these classifications, it is important to be aware of the broad overlap between neurodegenerative and vascular diseases in clinical and pathological levels, acknowledging the great heterogeneity in the cognitive impact of such diseases at an individual level.

The clinical diagnosis of VCI relies strongly on cognitive profile and neuroimaging findings. According to the most recent diagnostic guidelines, from the Vascular Impairment of Cognition Classification Consensus Study (VICCCS), VCI's definition aligns with the terminology of DSM-V and encompasses a broad clinical spectrum that ranges from mild to major VCI, and incorporates mixed-disease cases (Table 1). Subcortical ischemic vascular dementia (SIVaD) refers to cases in which SVD is the primary mechanism underlying cognitive decline, and the most common brain lesions are white matter hyperintensities (WMH) and lacunar infarcts. Importantly, according to VICCCS guidelines, individuals with neuroimaging signs of SVD may qualify for SIVaD, post-stroke dementia or mixed-dementia, depending on temporal associations and comorbidities.

### Small vessel disease, a marker of brain health: what the radiologist needs to know [^4d7087bd]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Small vessel disease, a disorder of cerebral microvessels, is an expanding epidemic and a common cause of stroke and dementia. Despite being almost ubiquitous in brain imaging, the clinicoradiologic association of small vessel disease is weak, and the underlying pathogenesis is poorly understood. The STandards for ReportIng Vascular changes on nEuroimaging (STRIVE) criteria have standardized the nomenclature. These include white matter hyperintensities of presumed vascular origin, recent small subcortical infarcts, lacunes of presumed vascular origin, prominent perivascular spaces, cerebral microbleeds, superficial siderosis, cortical microinfarcts, and brain atrophy. Recently, the rigid categories among cognitive impairment, vascular dementia, stroke, and small vessel disease have become outdated, with a greater emphasis on brain health. Conventional and advanced small vessel disease imaging markers allow a comprehensive assessment of global brain heath. In this review, we discuss the pathophysiology of small vessel disease neuroimaging nomenclature by means of the STRIVE criteria, clinical implications, the role of advanced imaging, and future directions.

### Antithrombotic therapy to prevent cognitive decline in people with small vessel disease on neuroimaging but without dementia [^474fbcef]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Cerebral small vessel disease is a progressive disease of the brain's deep perforating blood vessels. It is usually diagnosed based on lesions seen on brain imaging. Cerebral small vessel disease is a common cause of stroke but can also cause a progressive cognitive decline. As antithrombotic therapy is an established treatment for stroke prevention, we sought to determine whether antithrombotic therapy might also be effective in preventing cognitive decline in people with small vessel disease.

Objectives

To assess the effects of antithrombotic therapy for prevention of cognitive decline in people with small vessel disease on neuroimaging but without dementia.

Search Methods

We searched ALOIS, the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Review Group's Specialised Register, and the Cochrane Stroke Group's Specialised Register; the most recent search was on 21 July 2021. We also searched MEDLINE, Embase, four other databases and two trials registries. We searched the reference lists of the articles retrieved from these searches. As trials with a stroke focus may include relevant subgroup data, we complemented these searches with a focussed search of all antithrombotic titles in the Cochrane Stroke Group database.  SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCT) of people with neuroimaging evidence of at least mild cerebral small vessel disease (defined here as white matter hyperintensities, lacunes of presumed vascular origin and subcortical infarcts) but with no evidence of dementia. The trials had to compare antithrombotic therapy of minimum 24 weeks' duration to no antithrombotic therapy (either placebo or treatment as usual), or compare different antithrombotic treatment regimens. Antithrombotic therapy could include antiplatelet agents (as monotherapy or combination therapy), anticoagulants or a combination.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened all the titles identified by the searches. We assessed full texts for eligibility for inclusion according to our prespecified selection criteria, extracted data to a proforma and assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane tool for RCTs. We evaluated the certainty of evidence using GRADE. Due to heterogeneity across included participants, interventions and outcomes of eligible trials, it was not possible to perform meta-analyses.

Main Results

We included three RCTs (3384 participants). One study investigated the effect of antithrombotic therapy in participants not yet on antithrombotic therapy; two studies investigated the effect of additional antithrombotic therapy, one in a population already taking a single antithrombotic agent and one in a mixed population (participants on an antithrombotic drug and antithrombotic-naive participants). Intervention and follow-up durations varied from 24 weeks to four years. Jia 2016 was a placebo-controlled trial assessing 24 weeks of treatment with DL-3-n-butylphthalide (a compound with multimodal actions, including a putative antiplatelet effect) in 280 Chinese participants with vascular cognitive impairment caused by subcortical ischaemic small vessel disease, but without dementia. There was very low-certainty evidence for a small difference in cognitive test scores favouring treatment with DL-3-n-butylphthalide, as measured by the 12-item Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive subscale (adjusted mean difference -1.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.02 to -0.12), but this difference may not be clinically relevant. There was also very low-certainty evidence for greater proportional improvement measured with the Clinician Interview-Based Impression of Change-Plus Caregiver Input (57% with DL-3-n-butylphthalide versus 42% with placebo; P = 0.01), but there was no difference in other measures of cognition (Mini-Mental State Examination and Clinical Dementia Rating) or function. There was no evidence of a difference in adverse events between treatment groups. The SILENCE RCT compared antithrombotic therapy (aspirin) and placebo during four years of treatment in 83 participants with 'silent brain infarcts' who were on no prior antithrombotic therapy. There was very low-certainty evidence for no difference between groups across various measures of cognition and function, rates of stroke or adverse events. The Secondary Prevention of Subcortical Stroke Study (SPS3) compared dual antiplatelet therapy (clopidogrel plus aspirin) to aspirin alone in 3020 participants with recent lacunar stroke. There was low-certainty evidence of no effect on cognitive outcomes as measured by the Cognitive Abilities Screening Instruments (CASI) assessed annually over five years. There was also low-certainty evidence of no difference in the annual incidence of mild cognitive decline between the two treatment groups (9.7% with dual antiplatelet therapy versus 9.9% with aspirin), or the annual stroke recurrence rate (2.5% with dual antiplatelet therapy versus 2.7% with aspirin). Bleeding risk may be higher with dual antiplatelet therapy (hazard ratio (HR) 2.15, 95% CI 1.49 to 3.11; low certainty evidence), but there may be no significant increase in intracerebral bleeding risk (HR 1.52, 95% CI 0.79 to 2.93; low-certainty evidence). None of the included trials assessed the incidence of new dementia.

Authors' Conclusions

We found no convincing evidence to suggest any clinically relevant cognitive benefit of using antithrombotic therapy in addition to standard treatment in people with cerebral small vessel disease but without dementia, but there may be an increased bleeding risk with this approach. There was marked heterogeneity across the trials and the certainty of the evidence was generally poor.

### Cerebral small vessel disease: early-life antecedents and long-term implications for the brain, aging, stroke, and dementia [^50162c45]. Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) refers to a syndrome of clinical and neuroimaging findings in the white and subcortical gray matter resulting from pathologies in the small perforating cerebral arterioles, capillaries, and venules, manifesting on computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging or pathology examination as white matter hyperintensities (WMHs), small subcortical infarcts, lacunes, enlarged perivascular spaces, microbleeds, and atrophy. Clinically, SVD presents as ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, gait and balance dysfunction, and behavioral and neuropsychiatric symptoms. It is the leading cause of vascular cognitive impairment (VCI), responsible for up to 45% of dementias either as vascular or mixed with Alzheimer disease(AD), affecting all major cognitive domains.

SVD is often attributed to common vascular risk factors, particularly hypertension, smoking, and diabetes,but the proportion of variance of SVD lesion burden explained by these risk factors combined is small (≈2%),and risk factor modification clinical trials have so far had limited effects on preventing recurrent stroke, cognitive decline, and WMH progression (eg, the Secondary Prevention of Small Subcortical Strokes Trial [SPS3] trial). Furthermore, although WMHs are considered a primary pathology in VCIwith a dose-dependent effect on cognition, risk of cognitive decline in those with WMHs varies considerably,suggesting other factors contribute to SVD pathology and associated cognitive decline and dementia.

Growing evidence about protective factors for SVD, stroke, and dementia emphasizes a life-course model with a key role for early-life factors. The World Health Organization identified a life-course approach as a priority for policy action in the Health 2020 frameworkand in their intersectional global action plan for optimizing brain health across the life course.In 2020, reports by the World Health Organization–United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) –Lancet Commission and the Lancet Commission on Dementia Prevention highlighted the lifelong, intergenerational benefits of investment in children’s health and early development including reducing preterm birth, poor nutrition and growth, prioritizing education for all, and reducing deprivation and inequality. The Lancet Commission advocated for an approach to dementia prevention focused on enhancing cognitive resilience in later life by building cognitive reserve earlier in life.

Introduction

Chronic injury to the small vessels of the brain (‘small vessel disease’) is associated with acute lacunar stroke,progressive cognitive decline,late-onset refractory depression,functional impairment in daily livingand increased mortality.Despite accounting for approximately 30% of strokes and 40% of dementia,the underlying mechanism of small vessel injury is unclear. White matter hyperintensities are highly prevalent in the population, affecting the majority of patients over the age of 65.However, even patients with advanced imaging changes can remain functionally independent,indicating a pre-clinical stage where intervention may prevent progression of SVD and resulting morbidity. Development of treatments to prevent progression of SVD, particularly in ‘at risk’ patients with non-embolic strokes, is vital to reduce the resulting morbidity in the population.

### Frequency and underlying pathology of pure vascular cognitive impairment (...) [^ba8f1692]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

In mixed-effects models including all the pathologies, only macroinfarcts were associated with a faster cognitive decline rate in the vascular subgroup. Further analyses identified macroinfarcts in the frontal white matter to be associated with faster cognitive decline rate when macroinfarcts of cortical and subcortical brain regions were examined in a single model. Participants were observed for a mean of 8. 4 years prior to death, which enabled examining cognitive decline rate and the associated pathologies in the 3 pathology subgroups. In a mixed-effects model including terms for the subgroups, cognitive decline was fastest in the mixed subgroup, followed by the neurodegenerative and vascular subgroups. Global cognition is composed of cognitive functions. We examined whether macroinfarcts were associated with decline rate in specific cognitive functions.

In 5 separate mixed-effects models, we replaced global cognition with 5 cognitive functions. Macroinfarcts were associated with a faster decline rate in all the cognitive functions except visuospatial ability. In a cohort of 1767 older adults, 369 were without significant neurodegenerative brain pathologies. In this subgroup, we found that cerebrovascular disease pathologies, specifically macroinfarcts, were associated with higher odds of cognitive impairment and dementia and a faster rate of cognitive decline. By examining brain regions, we found that the main associates of pure VCI were macroinfarcts in white matters that possibly resulted in cognitive impairment and dementia by interruption of communication between cortical and subcortical brain regions.

Our findings indicate that it is mainly white matter disruptions in the frontal and, to a lower extent, parietal lobe that is associated with cognitive decline in pure VCI, findings supported by imaging studies that reported strategic locations of brain infarcts and disrupted white matter tracts. 24, 32 As these brain regions are specifically associated with executive functions and processing speed, our findings are also in line with prior research that identified processing speed impairment as a prominent manifestation of cerebrovascular disease pathologies. 33 The mechanism linking cerebrovascular disease pathologies with frontal white matter disruption in not clear. An observational study using patients’ registries found a lower risk of dementia in patients with atrial fibrillation treated with anticoagulants. 44.

### White matter lesion progression: a surrogate endpoint for trials in cerebral small-vessel disease [^1e37ffd4]. Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

There is neuropathologic evidence that confluent MRI white matter lesions in the elderly reflect ischemic brain damage due to microangiopathy. The authors hypothesize that measuring changes in the progression of white matter lesions as shown by MRI may provide a surrogate marker in clinical trials on cerebral small-vessel disease in which the currently used primary outcomes are cognitive impairment and dementia. This hypothesis is based on evidence that confluent white matter lesions progress rapidly as shown in a recent follow-up study in community-dwelling subjects. The mean increase in lesion volume was 5.2 cm(3) after 3 years. Based on these data in a clinical trial, 195 subjects with confluent lesions would be required per treatment arm to demonstrate a 20% reduction in the rate of disease progression over a 3-year period. Like any other MRI metric, the change in white matter lesion volume cannot be considered preferable to clinical outcomes unless it has been demonstrated that it matters to the patient in terms of function.

### Cerebral small vessel disease burden and longitudinal cognitive decline from age 73 to 82: the lothian birth cohort 1936 [^31b24a6f]. Translational Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) is a major cause of cognitive impairment in older adults. It causes ~25% of all strokes and is the second most common cause of dementia after Alzheimer’s disease, either on its own or through mixed pathologies. Caused by dysfunction of the brain’s arterioles, capillaries and venules, the downstream effects of SVD are visible on neuroimaging as white matter hyperintensities (WMH) and lacunes of presumed vascular origin, cerebral microbleeds and visible perivascular spaces (PVS; see Fig. 1). In most individuals, these radiological markers do not result in overt clinical symptoms; however, their presence doubles the risk of stroke, and increases the risk of dementia and death in the general population. Despite its contribution to cognitive decline and to the development of associated co-morbidities, the precise nature of the associations between the radiological burden of SVD and decline in domain-specific cognitive abilities remains unclear.

### New horizons in cognitive and functional impairment as a consequence of cerebral small vessel disease [^3fcaff81]. Age and Ageing (2023). Medium credibility.

In contrast to prognostic purposes, aetiological diagnosis and subsequent (personalised) treatment are best served by specific (and therefore individual) markers of underlying pathology. The development of effective treatments against VCI may well depend on the ability of neuroimaging to detect the specific target pathologies, such as cerebral amyloid angiopathy. This applies to treatment efficacy as well as harm. With the availability of novel monoclonal antibodies for treatment of AD, identifying through neuroimaging subjects who are at risk of side effects (e.g. amyloid-related imaging abnormalities) due to concomitant vascular pathology will become increasingly important. In older patients with cognitive impairment, in whom vascular pathology commonly coincides with other neuropathology, measures of vascular injury might help to select patients in whom the potential benefit of targeted treatment outweighs its risk of harm.

With respect to the current role of imaging within the diagnostic work-up of cognitive complaints, structural imaging serves primarily to identify potential underlying causes for cognitive decline when clinical uncertainty exists about the neurodegenerative nature of complaints. In particular cases, there may be need for imaging to inform a nosological diagnosis. Whilst such decisions are informed by the needs of patients and physicians, the clinical implications of potential findings, either for prognosis or treatment, should be leading in the use of any diagnostic tool. Thus, should we offer neuroimaging to all patients presenting with cognitive complaints to assess cSVD? At this stage, the answer would be a clear ‘no’. As endorsed in most clinical guidelines, this may well change in the face of aforementioned disease modifying therapies and validation of novel imaging tools whilst current prognostic value and (lack of) targeted treatment often limit the implications of brain imaging.

Neurovasculome—microinfarcts and gray-matter hypoperfusion are linked to cognitive impairment, as hypoperfusion in the gray matter may cause microinfarcts that are small (on average, ≈200 μm on postmortem examination), are twice as frequent in individuals with dementia, and can number in the thousands with effects on connectivity and neurovascular function beyond their borders that can adversely affect brain networks subserving cognition.

### Global burden of small vessel disease-related brain changes on MRI predicts cognitive and functional decline [^5bfba791]. Stroke (2020). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose- Cerebral small vessel disease is characterized by a wide range of focal and global brain changes. We used a magnetic resonance imaging segmentation tool to quantify multiple types of small vessel disease-related brain changes and examined their individual and combined predictive value on cognitive and functional abilities. Methods- Magnetic resonance imaging scans of 560 older individuals from LADIS (Leukoaraiosis and Disability Study) were analyzed using automated atlas- and convolutional neural network-based segmentation methods yielding volumetric measures of white matter hyperintensities, lacunes, enlarged perivascular spaces, chronic cortical infarcts, and global and regional brain atrophy. The subjects were followed up with annual neuropsychological examinations for 3 years and evaluation of instrumental activities of daily living for 7 years. Results- The strongest predictors of cognitive performance and functional outcome over time were the total volumes of white matter hyperintensities, gray matter, and hippocampi ( P <0.001 for global cognitive function, processing speed, executive functions, and memory and P <0.001 for poor functional outcome). Volumes of lacunes, enlarged perivascular spaces, and cortical infarcts were significantly associated with part of the outcome measures, but their contribution was weaker. In a multivariable linear mixed model, volumes of white matter hyperintensities, lacunes, gray matter, and hippocampi remained as independent predictors of cognitive impairment. A combined measure of these markers based on Z scores strongly predicted cognitive and functional outcomes ( P <0.001) even above the contribution of the individual brain changes. Conclusions- Global burden of small vessel disease-related brain changes as quantified by an image segmentation tool is a powerful predictor of long-term cognitive decline and functional disability. A combined measure of white matter hyperintensities, lacunar, gray matter, and hippocampal volumes could be used as an imaging marker associated with vascular cognitive impairment.

### METACOHORTS for the study of vascular disease and its contribution to cognitive decline and neurodegeneration: an initiative of the joint programme for neurodegenerative disease research [^4f67588d]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2016). Low credibility.

1 Introduction

Worldwide, nearly 36 million people are estimated to be living with dementia. This is expected to triple by 2050. Cerebrovascular disease causes up to 45% of all dementias alone or in conjunction with Alzheimer's disease (AD),. Despite vascular risk factor reduction being an achievable target for public health intervention in many countries, and some recent evidence of success in preventing dementia, knowledge about vascular contributions to dementia remains modest.

Many studies, from the early 1990s onward, have demonstrated that cognitive impairment and dementia are both common and under-recognized after stroke. The concept of “vascular cognitive impairment” was introduced in 1994, covering a spectrum of cognitive impairment after stroke to cognitive impairment in association with otherwise asymptomatic cerebrovascular disease. The most common vascular contributor to dementia is cerebral small vessel disease (SVD), a condition that affects perforating vessels, thence white and gray matter, and accelerates neurodegenerative processes. Vascular dementia reflects the global effects of vascular disease on the brain, not just of multiple individual infarcts.It results in stroke, cognitive decline and dementia, plus neuropsychiatric symptoms, gait, balance,, and continence problems, necessitating a larger framework for targeted, comprehensive studies.

In 2006, the National Institute for Neurological Disorders and Stroke and the Canadian Stroke Network convened a multidisciplinary research group to recommend standards for the study of vascular cognitive impairment. In 2013 the Alzheimer's Association convened an expert working group, which summarized the state of vascular cognitive impairment science and identified areas where new knowledge is needed. However, despite strong and unanimous evidence for the major burden of vascular cognitive impairment on both patients and their caregivers, most dementia research largely overlooks vascular disease as a cause. In part, this reflects that clinicians and researchers working on dementia, stroke, physical, or psychiatric manifestations are still too often segregated. “Stroke” and “dementia” (both syndromes, not pathological diagnoses) present to different clinical specialists (Fig. 1); stroke specialists under-recognize the cognitive impact of stroke, whereas dementia specialists under-recognize vascular inputs to dementia pathophysiology. This separation also affects research and funding initiatives, for example, vascular disease was rarely mentioned in a report on 169 European studies considered relevant to neurodegenerative disease research. Better diagnostic criteria for the different cognitive profiles of vascular and AD are also needed.

1 BACKGROUND

Cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) refers to a group of brain pathologies resulting from partial or complete occlusion of small‐diameter cerebral arteries, typically those measuring less than 400 microns.These vascular changes lead to structural brain injury manifesting on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as white matter hyperintensities (WMHs), lacunes, and cerebral microbleeds (CMBs).

Imaging markers of CSVD are observed frequently during the clinical evaluation of individuals with strokeor cognitive decline.Because the prevalence of cerebrovascular disease increases with age,CSVD‐related neuroimaging markers are more commonly seen in adults age 65 or older, and are considerably less prevalent in younger individuals.This lower prevalence results in poor representation of young adults in CSVD research cohorts, and the poorly understood relationship of vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and vascular cognitive decline (VCI) in this age group.

The current study aimed to assess the contribution of CSVD markers in individuals presenting with cognitive complaints to a memory clinic, representing a real‐world clinical population. In particular, the study aimed to compare CSVD between early and late age at onset cognitive decline and dementia (EO and LO, respectively), with EO traditionally defined as symptom onset before the age of 65.Given the paucity of research in EO, our hypothesis was derived not only from the established role of CSVD in cognitive impairment, but also from the need to address this underexplored population. We hypothesized that EO would exhibit greater vulnerability for CSVD than LO, consistent with observations of increased susceptibility to co‐morbid neurodegenerative pathology in this group.

### Role of neuroimaging in multidisciplinary approach towards non-Alzheimer's dementia [^e43a8ac3]. Insights Into Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

Vascular dementia (VaD)

Binswanger and Alzheimer first described VaD and recognized the role of multiple infarctions and chronic ischemia in its etiopathogenesis. VaD is the most common cause of non-Alzheimer dementia in the aging population and often contributes to cognitive impairment in AD and other forms of so-called “mixed dementias”. Unlike AD, there are no pathological criteria for the diagnosis of VaD. The clinical criteria are poorly understood and validated. It’s a heterogeneous syndrome rather than a distinct disorder, in which the underlying cause is cerebrovascular disease in some form and its ultimate manifestation is dementia. Three common forms of ischemic lesions can result in VaD: 1) Large artery infarcts involving the cortex and subcortical regions due to thromboembolic occlusion of major intracranial arteries; 2) Small artery infarctions or lacunes attributed to arteriolosclerosis involving the penetrating arteries and affecting the thalamus, basal ganglia, internal capsule, brain stem and cerebellum; 3) Periventricular white matter disease resulting from chronic subcortical ischemia of small arteries affecting the neurons, oligodedrocytes and astrocytes. Multiple studies have shown that in nearly 6 to 32 % of cases with lobar and lacunar ischemic stroke, one can show post stroke cognitive impairment and dementia. The presence of microbleeds, a manifestation of small vessel disease, is also associated with cognitive decline. The number of infarcts and anatomic distribution of ischemic stroke, rather than the volume, determines the development of VaD. The more vulnerable areas are the hippocampus, angular gyrus, cingulate gyrus, frontal lobe or deep gray and white matter (thalamus, fornix, basal forebrain, caudate, globus pallidus, and the genu or anterior limb of the internal capsule). Advanced age, increased severity of the stroke, recurrent strokes, white matter disease, cortical atrophy (particularly in the temporal lobe), hypertension, obesity, elevated homocysteine, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus are the common associated risk factors. The clinical presentation varies depending on cortical or subcortical ischemic lesions. Cortical lesions tend to be sudden onset with more focal neurodeficits, whereas subcortical lacunar infarcts and white matter disease have more gradual or stepwise decline of cognitive functions.

Inflammation in other age-related cerebrovascular diseases

Inflammation in vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID) with aging

VCID is a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by cognitive deficits secondary to cerebrovascular pathology. Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion is important in the onset of VCID. After AD, VCID is the second most common cause of dementia and accounts for ~15% of all dementia cases when it occurs as a single dementia diagnosis. Many dementia patients have mixed dementia (i.e.VCID and AD pathologies). The risk of dementia after a cardiovascular event varies by its severity and the incidence of VCID increases with age.

People over the age of 65 are at the highest risk for VCID. A stroke patient has two-fold increased risk of developing dementia compared with an individual with no history of stroke. This risk is highest within the 6 months after stroke; however, an increased risk prevails for at least a decade, even after controlling for known dementia risk factors. Although there are no treatments for post-stroke dementia, recent evidence has improved our understanding of the mechanisms that contribute to cognitive decline. What molecular mechanisms govern high risk of dementia incidence in stroke survivors are not identified; however, growing evidence from clinical and pre-clinical studies suggests that there exists a connection between neuroinflammation and cognitive decline. Thus, chronic brain inflammation caused by defective elimination of harmful substances and exacerbated and extended immune response may contribute to post-stroke dementia. The role of immunosenescence and inflammaging in cerebral small vessel disease has been recently reviewed.

### Regional white matter hyperintensities and Alzheimer's disease biomarkers among older adults with normal cognition and mild cognitive impairment [^9cf8c9dc]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2023). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology is present in a subset of older individuals who are cognitively normal. Older adults without cognitive impairment also commonly have evidence of small vessel cerebrovascular disease (CVD). Whereas the pathological hallmarks of AD are plaques and tangles (primarily consisting of the accumulation of amyloid-β 42 (Aβ 42) and phosphorylated tau, respectively), the most common manifestation of CVD are white matter hyperintensities (WMH) on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. WMH appear as bright, hyperintense regions in white matter on T2-weighted MR images. WMH are commonly thought to reflect demyelination and axonal loss resulting from chronic ischemia (i.e. reduced blood supply) due to the narrowing or occlusion of small vessels in the white matter. WMHs increase in prevalence with age, are associated with vascular risk factors, and contribute to cognitive decline and impairment.

Although WMHs most commonly have a vascular origin, some evidence suggests that there may also be an AD-specific pathway contributing to WMH, particularly to WMH in the parietal lobe. For example, pre-symptomatic carriers of autosomal dominant AD genetic mutations without appreciable vascular risk have elevated WMH volumes, in addition to abnormal AD biomarkers, several years before expected symptom onset, particularly in parietal and occipital regions. Similarly, prior studies have reported greater posterior WMHs (adjusting for global WMH burden) among participants with AD-dementia compared to older controls (e.g.). Additional evidence linking AD to ischemic damage comes from recent genetic and molecular work demonstrating that expression of many of the top AD risk genes is enriched in human brain vascular and perivascular cell types and that these cell types are selectively vulnerable to AD.

### Impact of small vessel disease progression on long-term cognitive and functional changes after stroke [^21e8f124]. Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

This study found that the key components of the dementia syndrome, combined decline in cognition and independence, are associated with the presence and progression of WMH in the year after a stroke. One-year, but not baseline, WMH volumes are strongly associated with contemporaneous cognitive scores, superseding other clinical factors. This suggests that dynamic WMH in the weeks after a stroke do not reflect permanent brain damage, but by 1 year, perhaps when any modifiable component of WMH such as interstitial oedema has cleared,, WMH volumes may more closely represent the underlying permanent damage and hence better correlate with cognition. Studies evaluating patients for as long as possible after stroke, that is, to 3 years and beyond, are needed to capture the full long-term implications.

These results call for an acceleration of research into processes driving SVD-related cognitive decline. The emergence of a WMH-cognitive association 1 year after a stroke represents a short but achievable therapeutic window for halting SVD progression and potentially preserving cognitive ability and independence after stroke.

It would be useful to determine whether a combined, covarying cognitive and mRS score outcome could predict conversion to incident dementia in the longer term. We should encourage consistent analysis of levels of independence alongside cognitive ability in stroke research. A more detailed spatial analysis assessing patterns with persisting WMH vs WMH that dynamically appear and disappear would give more precise insights into the influence of SVD on the clinical course after a stroke. Moreover, an analysis of whether WMH lesions behave differently adjacent to vs remote from the stroke lesion, whether this affects lesion evolution, and whether this influences outcomes after stroke is required.

Despite secondary prevention, vascular risk factors were not associated with change in cognitive scores in our study. This reinforces the finding that alternative treatment approaches to target the underlying pathophysiology of SVD are particularly important.

We need to closely track the natural history of dementia after stroke and to determine whether clinically and radiologically distinct dementia subtypes emerge over time. Identifying subgroups will allow future triage of clinical presentations to appropriate services, the development of disease-specific management strategies, and targeted entry into future research trials.

### Is vascular cognitive impairment a useful concept? [^49534b6c]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2010). Low credibility.

Dementia and milder degrees of cognitive impairment are common in older age. Many causes of dementia have been described, which can be broadly divided into primary neurodegenerative, such as Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia or dementia with Lewy bodies, and those in which brain changes are secondary to trauma, stroke or infection. This dichotomous separation is conceptually sound. However, the majority of patients with dementia occurring in old age, actually suffer from a combination of neurodegenerative and vascular changes. Attempting to divide the dementia disorder dichotomously into Alzheimer's disease and vascular cognitive impairment may be inappropriate and may mislead the search for important mechanisms and delay the discovery of novel therapeutic targets.

### Neuroimaging standards for research into small vessel disease and its contribution to ageing and neurodegeneration [^525b24c0]. The Lancet: Neurology (2013). Medium credibility.

Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) is a common accompaniment of ageing. Features seen on neuroimaging include recent small subcortical infarcts, lacunes, white matter hyperintensities, perivascular spaces, microbleeds, and brain atrophy. SVD can present as a stroke or cognitive decline, or can have few or no symptoms. SVD frequently coexists with neurodegenerative disease, and can exacerbate cognitive deficits, physical disabilities, and other symptoms of neurodegeneration. Terminology and definitions for imaging the features of SVD vary widely, which is also true for protocols for image acquisition and image analysis. This lack of consistency hampers progress in identifying the contribution of SVD to the pathophysiology and clinical features of common neurodegenerative diseases. We are an international working group from the Centres of Excellence in Neurodegeneration. We completed a structured process to develop definitions and imaging standards for markers and consequences of SVD. We aimed to achieve the following: first, to provide a common advisory about terms and definitions for features visible on MRI; second, to suggest minimum standards for image acquisition and analysis; third, to agree on standards for scientific reporting of changes related to SVD on neuroimaging; and fourth, to review emerging imaging methods for detection and quantification of preclinical manifestations of SVD. Our findings and recommendations apply to research studies, and can be used in the clinical setting to standardise image interpretation, acquisition, and reporting. This Position Paper summarises the main outcomes of this international effort to provide the STandards for ReportIng Vascular changes on nEuroimaging (STRIVE).

### Post-stroke cognitive impairment and dementia [^74cbce0a]. Circulation Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Poststroke cognitive impairment and dementia (PSCID) is a major source of morbidity and mortality after stroke worldwide. PSCID occurs as a consequence of ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, or subarachnoid hemorrhage. Cognitive impairment and dementia manifesting after a clinical stroke is categorized as vascular even in people with comorbid neurodegenerative pathology, which is common in elderly individuals and can contribute to the clinical expression of PSCID. Manifestations of cerebral small vessel disease, such as covert brain infarcts, white matter lesions, microbleeds, and cortical microinfarcts, are also common in patients with stroke and likewise contribute to cognitive outcomes. Although studies of PSCID historically varied in the approach to timing and methods of diagnosis, most of them demonstrate that older age, lower educational status, socioeconomic disparities, premorbid cognitive or functional decline, life-course exposure to vascular risk factors, and a history of prior stroke increase risk of PSCID. Stroke characteristics, in particular stroke severity, lesion volume, lesion location, multiplicity and recurrence, also influence PSCID risk. Understanding the complex interaction between an acute stroke event and preexisting brain pathology remains a priority and will be critical for developing strategies for personalized prediction, prevention, targeted interventions, and rehabilitation. Current challenges in the field relate to a lack of harmonization of definition and classification of PSCID, timing of diagnosis, approaches to neurocognitive assessment, and duration of follow-up after stroke. However, evolving knowledge on pathophysiology, neuroimaging, and biomarkers offers potential for clinical applications and may inform clinical trials. Preventing stroke and PSCID remains a cornerstone of any strategy to achieve optimal brain health. We summarize recent developments in the field and discuss future directions closing with a call for action to systematically include cognitive outcome assessment into any clinical studies of poststroke outcome.

### Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cerebrovascular disease: a comprehensive review [^e6d5f7db]. Respiratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Along with the aging population, the public health burden of cerebrovascular disease is increasing. Cerebral small vessel disease and accumulation of brain pathology associate with cognitive decline and can lead to clinical outcomes, such as stroke and dementia. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a common respiratory disease among elderly. The quality of life and prognosis of patients with COPD is greatly determined by the presence of comorbidities including stroke and cognitive impairment. Despite the clinical relevance of cerebral small vessel disease, stroke and (vascular) cognitive impairment in patients with COPD, literature is scarce and underlying mechanisms are unknown. The aim of the present review is therefore to summarize current scientific knowledge, to provide a better understanding of the interplay between COPD and the aging brain and to define remaining knowledge gaps. This narrative review article 1) overviews the epidemiology of cerebral small vessel disease, stroke and cognitive impairment in patients with COPD; 2) discusses potential underlying mechanisms including aging, smoking, systemic inflammation, vasculopathy, hypoxia and genetic susceptibility; and 3) highlights areas requiring further research.

### Cerebral small vessel disease: from a focal to a global perspective [^fac82d88]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2018). Medium credibility.

Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) is commonly observed on neuroimaging among elderly individuals and is recognized as a major vascular contributor to dementia, cognitive decline, gait impairment, mood disturbance and stroke. However, clinical symptoms are often highly inconsistent in nature and severity among patients with similar degrees of SVD on brain imaging. Here, we provide a new framework based on new advances in structural and functional neuroimaging that aims to explain the remarkable clinical variation in SVD. First, we discuss the heterogeneous pathology present in SVD lesions despite an identical appearance on imaging and the perilesional and remote effects of these lesions. We review effects of SVD on structural and functional connectivity in the brain, and we discuss how network disruption by SVD can lead to clinical deficits. We address reserve and compensatory mechanisms in SVD and discuss the part played by other age-related pathologies. Finally, we conclude that SVD should be considered a global rather than a focal disease, as the classically recognized focal lesions affect remote brain structures and structural and functional network connections. The large variability in clinical symptoms among patients with SVD can probably be understood by taking into account the heterogeneity of SVD lesions, the effects of SVD beyond the focal lesions, the contribution of neurodegenerative pathologies other than SVD, and the interaction with reserve mechanisms and compensatory mechanisms.

### Imaging biomarkers of vascular cognitive impairment: lessons from structural progression in cerebral small vessel disease [^e863ecc6]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

The study by Lu et al. highlights progressive structural changes in cerebral small vessel disease, spanning subcortical vascular mild cognitive impairment to vascular dementia. Using voxel-based morphometry, diffusion tensor imaging, and fixel-based analysis, the authors demonstrate converging gray and white matter alterations associated with both cognitive and motor decline. This commentary discusses the significance of their multimodal approach, its clinical implications for early diagnosis and disease monitoring, and the methodological challenges of generalizability and mixed pathology. We situate these findings within the broader literature on vascular cognitive impairment and emphasize directions for biomarker-driven translational research.

INTRODUCTION

Vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) refers to conditions in which cerebrovascular diseases contribute to decline in mental abilities [, ▪▪]. Although these diseases can independently lead to cognitive deficits and account for 15–30% of dementia cases, second only to Alzheimer's disease, they rarely occur in isolation [▪▪,]. Importantly, age-related cognitive impairment is typically driven by co-occurring vascular and neurodegenerative pathologies. In a recent clinical–pathologic populational study, the majority of participants (∼78%) had at least two concomitant neuropathologies at the time of death, most commonly neurodegenerative and vascular diseases.

Among the multiple mechanisms involved in VCI, cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) is arguably the most prevalent one, contributing to cognitive impairment irrespective of stroke [▪▪]. SVD is characterized by abnormalities that affect the structure and function of small vessels of the brain, with multiple neuroimaging and neurological manifestations, including cognitive decline [▪▪]. Rather than a homogeneous disorder, SVD encompasses different sporadic and inherited diseases, resulting from a complex mix of genetic and vascular risk factors. The prevalence of SVD increases with age, and the two most common sporadic types are arteriolosclerosis, also referred to as hypertensive arteriopathy or deep perforator arteriopathy, and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). Arteriolosclerosis has been traditionally linked to hypertension and type II diabetes. In pathology, arteriosclerosis is characterized by abnormal thickening of arteriolar walls, preferentially located in the deep grey nuclei and deep white matter, observed in >80% of individuals over 80 years of age, according to autopsy studies. CAA is defined by pathological deposition of amyloid-β in the walls of cortical and leptomeningeal arterioles and capillaries. Moreover, CAA is known to commonly co-occur with Alzheimer's disease [▪▪].

In this narrative review, we focus on the latest advances in the management of sporadic SVD-related VCI, with an update on diagnostic criteria, neuroimaging markers and cognitive profile. We further address the current state of prevention and therapeutic approaches.

Small Vessels in Disease

Microvascular complications are well‐recognized effects of longstanding hypertension or diabetes. 50 In addition, small blood vessels themselves cause or contribute to a diversity of diseases and pathogenic processes, such as hypertension, coronary microvascular disease, pulmonary hypertension, sepsis, focal strokes, microinfarcts, large cerebral hemorrhages or microscopic hemorrhages (microbleeds), and dementia. 26 Additionally, subtle and chronic changes in vascular structure and function can lead to cerebral white matter damage and cognitive dysfunction. These are accompanied by increased BBB permeability, endothelial dysfunction, and alterations in myogenic tone, neurovascular coupling, and consequently cerebrovascular autoregulation. 27 Hypertension is a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease and increases in blood pressure are linearly related to a decrease in cognitive abilities. 28 Deleterious microvessel changes, such as those underlying chronic hypertension, can occur very early and exacerbate other pathological processes in many tissues and organs. 51 For instance, diabetes superimposed on hypertension exacerbates small artery remodeling and the degree of remodeling is greater in diabetics than in nondiabetic hypertensive patients. 52, 53 In the kidney, glomerular injury leading to renal insufficiency can arise from hypertension, impairment of microvascular function, inflammatory insult, or autoimmune conditions. 36, 54 Over prolonged periods, the impairment in vascular regulation in the kidney could accelerate progression of renal injury, and in the brain it could lead to cognitive impairment via chronic mismatch between the delivery of nutrients through blood flow and the brain high energy requirements, particularly in the subcortical white matter. 24

Large cerebral arteries, pial arterioles, intraparenchymal arterioles, capillaries, and venules react in a dramatically different way to hypertension. Stiffening, atherosclerosis, remodeling, collagenosis, and lipohyalinosis are observed in different vascular districts, resulting in distinct pathologies. For example, in the presence of atherosclerosis, the coronary endothelial vasomotor response to acetylcholine is frequently reduced but is variable between patients, 55 and in the CNS large vessel atherosclerosis may lead to vascular occlusion and focal stroke, small vessel atherosclerosis to microinfarcts, lipohyalinosis to white matter disease, and venous collagenosis may promote hemorrhage or microbleeds. 26 However, it remains to be established how different vascular segments of the cerebral microcirculation react to, or contribute to the etiology of essential hypertension and what the underlying mechanisms are. Therefore, it is important to investigate the effect of hypertension and other risk factors on different segments of the circulation and identify relevant cellular and molecular mechanisms leading to vascular dysfunction and damage, particularly at the level of small vessels.

### Is breakdown of the blood-brain barrier responsible for lacunar stroke, leukoaraiosis, and dementia? [^5d4f20c2]. Stroke (2003). Low credibility.

Background

The pathogenesis of and relationship between small deep (lacunar) infarcts, cerebral white matter disease (leukoaraiosis or white matter hyperintensities), and progressive cognitive impairment or dementia are much debated.

Summary Of Comment

We hypothesize that cerebral small-vessel endothelial (ie, blood-brain barrier) dysfunction, with leakage of plasma components into the vessel wall and surrounding brain tissue leading to neuronal damage, may contribute to the development of 3 overlapping and disabling cerebrovascular conditions: lacunar stroke, leukoaraiosis, and dementia. This hypothesis could explain the link between ischemic cerebral small-vessel disease and several apparently clinically distinct dementia syndromes. This hypothesis is supported by pathological, epidemiological, and experimental studies in lacunar stroke and leukoaraiosis and observations on the blood-brain barrier with MRI. We suspect that the potential significance of blood-brain barrier failure as a pathogenetic step linking vascular disease with common, disabling brain diseases of insidious onset has been overlooked. For example, lipohyalinosis, which has a pathological appearance of uncertain origin and is possibly responsible for some discrete lacunar infarcts, may be one end of a clinical spectrum of illness manifested by blood-brain barrier failure.

Conclusions

Proof that blood-brain barrier failure is key to these conditions could provide a target for new treatments to reduce the effects of vascular disease on the brain and prevent cognitive decline and dementia.

### Methods of a study to assess the contribution of cerebral small vessel disease and dementia risk alleles to racial disparities in vascular cognitive impairment and dementia [^443089b5]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

We will use all available cognitive assessment data for each participant and generate Z scores for everyone and for each time point of each assessment; this should allow us to evaluate overall as well as domain‐specific trajectory of cognitive decline. As stated earlier, available evidence suggests that CSVD predates development of ischemic stroke or TIA events and as such, this approach will enable us to demonstrate whether the burden of specific CSVD marker and/or overall CSVD is associated with a faster decline in cognitive function in the presence of a stroke or TIA and thus, identify a higher risk population for more targeted prevention strategies for cognitive decline. The cognitive data to be used will cover a total period of 10 years of follow‐up, divided into ≤4 years before the stroke or TIA event and up to 6 years after the stroke or TIA event. This will enable us to have 2 or more time points for analysis of pre‐ and post‐event cognitive trajectory.

We will define cognitive impairment using a standard definition already implemented in the REGARDS study,,,,and using Z score cutoffs. We will determine the prevalence (baseline) of cognitive impairment before the stroke or TIA using data from participants with at least 1 cognitive assessment based on the SIS within the last 4 years before the stroke or TIA event. Poststroke cognitive outcome/impairment will be based on cognitive assessments within the first 6 years after the stroke or TIA event.

Conventional neuroimaging markers in small vessel disease-related cognitive impairment

MRI-visible lesions represent only a small portion of the spectrum of brain injury related to SVD and probably reflect late and irreversible steps in this pathological process. Established SVD markers include WMH, lacunes, PVS, recent small subcortical infarcts, CMB, cSS, ICH and atrophy (Fig. 2). More recently, CMI and cSAH have been associated with SVD, especially with CAA (Fig. 2). Even though these markers are useful for the diagnosis of SVD, their relevance as predictors of cognitive impairment and dementia is less evident.

CMB's occurrence, number and topographical distribution reflect the presence, severity and cause of the underlying SVD and correlate with increased mortality and a higher risk of haemorrhagic and ischemic stroke [▪▪,]. However, although there is some evidence linking CMB to cognitive impairment, studies have yielded conflicting results and small effect sizes [▪▪,,], possibly because CMB do not cause significant disruption of adjacent tissues. Similarly, cSS contributes to in-vivo diagnosis of CAA and is strongly associated with recurrent lobar ICH, but there are insufficient data supporting an independent association with cognition.

In contrast, nonhaemorrhagic markers, in general, are more strongly associated with cognition. WMH is one of the earliest and most established markers of SVD, associated with increased risk of stroke and mortality [▪▪]. Recent meta-analyses support a strong link between WMH and VCI and indicate that extensive baseline burden, progression and periventricular distribution of WMH are associated with an increased risk of dementia [▪▪,]. Likewise, incident lacunes have been associated with dementia, worse executive function and psychomotor speed. Although the burden of cortical CMI is underestimated on MRI, they are considered the most widespread form of brain infarct, associated with CAA and highly prevalent in cognitively impaired individuals. In contrast with CMB, they are strongly associated with cognitive endpoints, affecting performance potentially by disrupting adjacent tracts, with secondary perilesional and remote degeneration. Although brain atrophy has been frequently associated with SVD, it reflects the final converging effects of aging and several other pathologies, including neurodegenerative diseases. Several studies link smaller brain volumes with cognitive impairment, yet none of them controlled for co-occurring Alzheimer's disease, limiting causal inferences. Increased visibility of PVS has also been associated with worse cognitive performance, but overall results are still conflicting, and its usefulness as a biomarker for cognition remains largely unknown.

### A longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging study of neurodegenerative and small vessel disease, and clinical cognitive trajectories in non demented patients with transient ischemic attack: the PREVENT study [^a6c160b8]. BMC Geriatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Late-life cognitive decline, caused by progressive neuronal loss leading to brain atrophy years before symptoms are detected, is expected to double in Canada over the next two decades. Cognitive impairment in late life is attributed to vascular and lifestyle related risk factors in mid-life in a substantial proportion of cases (50%), thereby providing an opportunity for effective prevention of cognitive decline if incipient disease is detected earlier. Patients presenting with transient ischemic attack (TIA) commonly display some degree of cognitive impairment and are at a 4-fold increased risk of dementia. In the Predementia Neuroimaging of Transient Ischemic Attack (PREVENT) study, we will address what disease processes (i.e. Alzheimer’s vs. vascular disease) lead to neurodegeneration, brain atrophy, and cognitive decline, and whether imaging measurements of brain iron accumulation using quantitative susceptibility mapping predicts subsequent brain atrophy and cognitive decline.

Methods

A total of 440 subjects will be recruited for this study with 220 healthy subjects and 220 TIA patients. Early Alzheimer’s pathology will be determined by cerebrospinal fluid samples (including tau, a marker of neuronal injury, and amyloid β 1–42) and by MR measurements of iron accumulation, a marker for Alzheimer’s-related neurodegeneration. Small vessel disease will be identified by changes in white matter lesion volume. Predictors of advanced rates of cerebral and hippocampal atrophy at 1 and 3 years will include in vivo Alzheimer’s disease pathology markers, and MRI measurements of brain iron accumulation and small vessel disease. Clinical and cognitive function will be assessed annually post-baseline for a period of 5-years using a clinical questionnaire and a battery of neuropsychological tests, respectively.

Discussion

The PREVENT study expects to demonstrate that TIA patients have increased early progressive rates of cerebral brain atrophy after TIA, before cognitive decline can be clinically detected. By developing and optimizing high-level machine learning models based on clinical data, image-based (quantitative susceptibility mapping, regional brain, and white matter lesion volumes) features, and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers, PREVENT will provide a timely opportunity to identify individuals at greatest risk of late-life cognitive decline early in the course of disease, supporting future therapeutic strategies for the promotion of healthy aging.

### Vascular cognitive impairment and Dementia: JACC scientific expert panel [^25a5f583]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Cognitive impairment associated with aging has emerged as one of the major public health challenges of our time. Although Alzheimer's disease is the leading cause of clinically diagnosed dementia in Western countries, cognitive impairment of vascular etiology is the second most common cause and may be the predominant one in East Asia. Furthermore, alterations of the large and small cerebral vasculature, including those affecting the microcirculation of the subcortical white matter, are key contributors to the clinical expression of cognitive dysfunction caused by other pathologies, including Alzheimer's disease. This scientific expert panel provides a critical appraisal of the epidemiology, pathobiology, neuropathology, and neuroimaging of vascular cognitive impairment and dementia, and of current diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. Unresolved issues are also examined to shed light on new basic and clinical research avenues that may lead to mitigating one of the most devastating human conditions.

### Detection, risk factors, and functional consequences of cerebral microinfarcts [^78d4665b]. The Lancet: Neurology (2017). Medium credibility.

Cerebral microinfarcts are small lesions that are presumed to be ischaemic. Despite the small size of these lesions, affected individuals can have hundreds to thousands of cerebral microinfarcts, which cause measurable disruption to structural brain connections, and are associated with dementia that is independent of Alzheimer's disease pathology or larger infarcts (ie, lacunar infarcts, and large cortical and non-lacunar subcortical infarcts). Substantial progress has been made with regard to understanding risk factors and functional consequences of cerebral microinfarcts, partly driven by new in-vivo detection methods and the development of animal models that closely mimic multiple aspects of cerebral microinfarcts in human beings. Evidence from these advances suggests that cerebral microinfarcts can be manifestations of both small vessel and large vessel disease, that cerebral microinfarcts are independently associated with cognitive impairment, and that these lesions are likely to cause damage to brain structure and function that extends beyond their actual lesion boundaries. Criteria for the identification of cerebral microinfarcts with in-vivo MRI are provided to support further studies of the association between these lesions and cerebrovascular disease and dementia.

### The enigma of vascular cognitive disorder and vascular dementia [^a8af78e5]. Acta Neuropathologica (2007). Low credibility.

The prevalence, morphology and pathogenesis of vascular dementia (VaD), recently termed vascular cognitive impairment, are a matter of discussion, and currently used clinical diagnostic criteria show moderate sensitivity (average 50%) and variable specificity (range 64-98%). In Western clinic-based series, VaD is suggested in 8-10% of cognitively impaired aged subjects. Its prevalence in autopsy series varies from 0.03 to 58%, with reasonable values of 8-15%, while in Japan it is seen in 22-35%. Neuropathologic changes associated with cognitive impairment include multifocal and/or diffuse disease and focal lesions: multi-infarct encephalopathy, white matter lesions or arteriosclerotic subcortical (leuko)encephalopathy, multilacunar state, mixed cortico-subcortical type, borderline/watershed lesions, rare granular cortical atrophy, post-ischemic encephalopathy and hippocampal sclerosis. They result from systemic, cardiac and local large or small vessel disease. Recent data indicate that cognitive decline is commonly associated with widespread small ischemic/vascular lesions (microinfarcts, lacunes) throughout the brain with predominant involvement of subcortical and functionally important brain areas. Their pathogenesis is multifactorial, and their pathophysiology affects neuronal networks involved in cognition, memory, behavior and executive functioning. Vascular lesions often coexist with Alzheimer disease (AD) and other pathologies. Minor cerebrovascular lesions, except for severe amyloid angiopathy, appear not essential for cognitive decline in full-blown AD, while both mild Alzheimer pathology and small vessel disease may interact synergistically. The lesion pattern of "pure" VaD, related to arteriosclerosis and microangiopathies, differs from that in mixed-type dementia (AD with vascular encephalopathy), more often showing large infarcts, which suggests different pathogenesis of both types of lesions. Due to the high variability of cerebrovascular pathology and its causative factors, no validated neuropathologic criteria for VaD are available, and a large variability across laboratories still exists in the procedures for morphologic examination and histology techniques.

Ischemic stroke caused by small vessel disease—epidemiology and risk profile: Cerebral small vessel disease accounts for 20% to 30% of ischemic stroke cases and is characterized by subcortical infarcts of <15 mm in diameter or lacunes in patients often presenting with lacunar stroke syndromes; hypertension and diabetes are the most commonly recognized risk factors. Although mortality risk is lower than other stroke types, the 1-year recurrence risk is estimated at 4% per year to 11% per year, and small vessel disease and lacunar strokes are a leading cause of vascular dementia and vascular cognitive impairment.

### Cerebral small vessel disease in sporadic and familial Alzheimer disease [^a3c4e995]. The American Journal of Pathology (2021). Medium credibility.

Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia. Biological definitions of AD are limited to the cerebral burden of amyloid β plaques, neurofibrillary pathology, and neurodegeneration. However, current evidence suggests that various features of small vessel disease (SVD) are part of and covertly modify both sporadic and familial AD. Neuroimaging studies suggest that white matter hyperintensities explained by vascular mechanisms occurs frequently in the AD spectrum. Recent advances have further emphasized that frontal periventricular and posterior white matter hyperintensities are associated with cerebral amyloid angiopathy in familial AD. Although whether SVD markers precede the classically recognized biomarkers of disease is debatable, post-mortem studies show that SVD pathology incorporating small cortical and subcortical infarcts, microinfarcts, microbleeds, perivascular spacing, and white matter attenuation is commonly found in sporadic as well as in mutation carriers with confirmed familial AD. Age-related cerebral vessel pathologies such as arteriolosclerosis and cerebral amyloid angiopathy modify progression or worsen risk by shifting the threshold for cognitive impairment and AD dementia. The incorporation of SVD as a biomarker is warranted in the biological definition of AD. Therapeutic interventions directly reducing the burden of brain amyloid β have had no major impact on the disease or delaying cognitive deterioration, but lowering the risk of vascular disease seems the only rational approach to tackle both early- and late-onset AD dementia.

### Rationale and design of a longitudinal study of cerebral small vessel diseases, clinical and imaging outcomes in patients presenting with mild ischaemic stroke: mild stroke study 3 [^2d670ee1]. European Stroke Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) describes diffuse disease processes affecting the perforating cerebral arterioles, capillaries, venules and consequent damage to the white and deep grey matter.This damage is visible on brain MRI as white matter hyperintensities (WMH), recent small subcortical infarcts, perivascular spaces, brain atrophy and cerebral microbleeds.

SVD causes 20% of ischaemic strokes and almost half of all dementias,, contributing to both vascular and Alzheimer’s dementia subtypes,its presence more than doubling future risk of stroke, dementia and functional impairment.

Recent advances in neuroimaging have uncovered candidate mechanisms for underlying pathophysiological processes. Furthermore, SVD appears to be more dynamic and global than previously thought, since recent studies show: (a) WMH can regress as well as progress; – (b) SVD is associated with cerebrovascular dysfunction including diffuse blood–brain barrier (BBB) failure;(c) with some evidence for other vascular dysfunctions including reduced cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) and increased intracranial pulsatility – and (d) acute, apparently ‘silent’, lesions on diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) may be more frequent than previously thought. –

### Small concomitant vascular lesions Do not influence rates of cognitive decline in patients with Alzheimer disease (...) [^b27227e9]. JAMA Network (2000). Excellent credibility.

In a comparative study5 of AD, vascular dementia, and mixed dementia, memory was more severely involved early in patients with AD. However, memory impairment in those with vascular and mixed dementia eventually caught up with memory impairment in those with AD, suggesting an important role for the ischemic component of mixed dementia. Recent studies6, 7 suggest that a concomitant cerebral infarction may aggravate the severity of dementia in patients with AD. Infarctions may magnify the effect of mild AD pathological features and result in the earlier expression of dementia.
8. To determine the severity of clinical dementia and the rate of cognitive decline over time, 2 cognitive measures were used: the Mini-Mental State Examination and the Dementia Rating Scale. These tests were readministered yearly to the patients as part of their structured neuropsychologic assessment.

We excluded patients with an initial MMSE score below 9 from the rate of decline analyses because subjects beginning below that level would have an insufficient range in which to decline. Unlike the Nun study6 or the report by Heyman et al, 7 we did not find that the presence of small cerebral infarcts significantly affected the severity of clinical dementia, although there was a trend toward the presence of a cerebral infarction being associated with more severe dementia on the DRS. This difference may be due to a difference in the method of patient selection: we defined the ischemic vascular lesion as an infarct with a volume of less than 10 cm3 in contrast to the Nun study, in which lacunar and larger infarcts were included. We found that the presence of small concomitant infarcts did not alter the rate of cognitive decline. The rate of cognitive decline in patients with AD is highly variable.

The average annual change in the MMSE score for a population of patients with AD varied from 1. 8 to
6. 7 points per year. 30 Despite the wide variation in individual annual score changes as a group, the average MMSE score of patients with pure AD declined about 3. 2 points per year and the average DRS score declined by
13. 2 points per year. These values are consistent with those in other published reports. The study conducted by Salmon et al31 revealed an average annual decline of 2. 8 points on the MMSE and
11. 4 points on the DRS and suggested that the DRS, with its greater range, reflects the change with increasing dementia severity more precisely.

### The neurovasculome: key roles in brain health and cognitive impairment: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^d3998e3c]. Stroke (2023). High credibility.

Stroke—Symptomatic stroke is a major cause of vascular cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID). Cerebrovascular disease can, in addition to stroke, cause covert vascular damage to the brain, detectable on neuroimaging as lacunar infarcts, white matter lesions (WMLs), cortical microinfarcts, and cerebral microbleeds. In patients with cerebral small-vessel disease, damage to the cerebral white matter (WM) may begin with increased blood–brain barrier (BBB) permeability, followed by suppression of cerebrovascular responses to CO2, and then ischemia, although other studies suggest that ischemia in watershed areas between cortical and subcortical arterial territories is the initial pathogenetic event.

### Blood-brain barrier permeability is associated with cognitive functioning in normal aging and neurodegenerative diseases [^2aea11cf]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Vascular disease and vascular risk factors are major public health issues, contributing to negative health outcomes and increasing health care costs.Vascular risk factors, such as hypertension, high cholesterol, diabetes, and obstructive sleep apnea, have a well‐established link to cerebrovascular pathology and accelerated cognitive decline.,Vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) and dementia is the second most common dementia syndrome and includes cognitive impairment related to stroke (large‐vessel disease) and subcortical ischemic vascular disease (SIVD). The SIVD variant of VCI and dementia, which is associated with vascular white matter injury and neuroinflammation,accounts for ≈15% to 45% of all dementia cases,and also can contribute to the cognitive decline observed in Alzheimer disease (AD).,

Vascular risk factors have been hypothesized to cause cerebrovascular disease via chronic hypoperfusion, which leads to a cascade of events that includes blood vessel injury (eg, fibrosis, hyalinosis), hypoxia, and ischemia. These mechanisms cause inflammation that disrupts the blood–brain barrier (BBB), resulting in white matter damage.,,,,The BBB is a semipermeable filter for the selective exchange of substances from the blood to the interstitial space. It is a homeostatic mechanism that is critical for proper synaptic functioning and connectivity.Dynamic contrast‐enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) allows for the quantification of BBB function by measuring the leakage of gadolinium contrast medium into the cerebral tissue.Support for the involvement of the BBB and neurodegeneration using this technique has highlighted increased permeability (ie, the extent of leakage) in Binswanger disease, a specific type of small‐vessel disease,,; vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) with and without dementia; AD; and normal aging.

### Long-term prognosis after lacunar infarction [^4573014b]. The Lancet: Neurology (2003). Medium credibility.

Lacunar infarcts, small deep infarcts that result from occlusion of a penetrating artery, account for about a quarter of all ischaemic strokes. These infarcts have commonly been regarded as benign vascular lesions with a favourable long-term prognosis. However, recent studies have shown that this is only the case early in the disease course. A few years after infarct, there is an increased risk of death, mainly from cardiovascular causes. The risk of recurrent stroke after lacunar infarct is similar to that for most other types of stroke, and patients have an increased risk of developing cognitive decline and dementia. Age, vascular risk factors, high nocturnal blood pressure, and severity of cerebral small-vessel disease at onset have significant prognostic implications for almost all outcomes. More studies on mechanisms, prevention, and treatment are needed to provide specific guidance on the long-term management of patients with lacunar infarcts. Risk-factor modification is likely to play a large part in therapeutic interventions targeted at this stroke subtype.

### Longitudinal decline in structural networks predicts dementia in cerebral small vessel disease [^a4621fb6]. Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Future research could be improved by using MRI with higher field strength and spatial resolution with isotropic voxel dimensions for all sequences.However, a major strength of the study was highly consistent data obtained from the same scanner without upgrade or change over the full data collection period.

We studied a group of individuals who had moderate to severe symptomatic SVD. By our inclusion criteria of taking patients with both definite ischemic (lacunar stroke) and confluent WMH, we aimed to identify patients in whom ischemic processes were likely to be the cause of their SVD and of any cognitive impairment, but our results require replication in participants with less severe SVD. Although we selected a population in whom SVD was likely to be the primary driver of cognitive impairment and dementia, it is well recognized that at post mortem, many such patients have a mixed picture with both vascular and Alzheimer pathology. To assess the potential role of Alzheimer pathology, we measured hippocampal volumes and found this was not a predictor of dementia in our population. This is in contrast to a population with milder SVD, in which baseline hippocampal volumes and network integrity both predicted dementia.It is possible that the more severe SVD in the SCANS population means this is therefore the predominant pathology causing dementia in this population, while in cases with milder radiologic changes of SVD, coexistent Alzheimer pathology has a relatively more important role.

### CNS small vessel disease: a clinical review [^a6dfa3b3]. Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

CNS small vessel disease (CSVD) causes 25% of strokes and contributes to 45% of dementia cases. Prevalence increases with age, affecting about 5% of people aged 50 years to almost 100% of people older than 90 years. Known causes and risk factors include age, hypertension, branch atheromatous disease, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, radiation exposure, immune-mediated vasculitides, certain infections, and several genetic diseases. CSVD can be asymptomatic; however, depending on location, lesions can cause mild cognitive dysfunction, dementia, mood disorders, motor and gait dysfunction, and urinary incontinence. CSVD is diagnosed on the basis of brain imaging biomarkers, including recent small subcortical infarcts, white matter hyperintensities, lacunes, cerebral microbleeds, enlarged perivascular spaces, and cerebral atrophy. Advanced imaging modalities can detect signs of disease even earlier than current standard imaging techniques. Diffusion tensor imaging can identify altered white matter connectivity, and blood oxygenation level-dependent imaging can identify decreased vascular reactivity. Pathogenesis is thought to begin with an etiologically specific insult, with or without genetic predisposition, which results in dysfunction of the neurovascular unit. Uncertainties regarding pathogenesis have delayed development of effective treatment. The most widely accepted approach to treatment is to intensively control well-established vascular risk factors, of which hypertension is the most important. With better understanding of pathogenesis, specific therapies may emerge. Early identification of pathologic characteristics with advanced imaging provides an opportunity to forestall progression before emergence of symptoms.

### Neuropathological diagnosis of vascular cognitive impairment and vascular dementia with implications for Alzheimer's disease [^ae2d8fce]. Acta Neuropathologica (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Cerebrovascular disease (CVD) is the second most common cause of age-related cognitive impairment and dementia, which is widely recognised as vascular dementia (VaD). VaD culminates from global or localised effects of vascular disease, which incurs stroke injury and other tissue perfusion changes. VaD is characterised as a neurocognitive disorder, but also incorporates behavioural symptoms, locomotor abnormalities and autonomic dysfunction. Vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) results from all causes of CVD including cardiovascular that lead to early and late plus severe forms of dementia syndromes. Within CVD, the most common vascular contributor to dementia is likely cerebral small vessel disease (SVD), which describes a range of clinical, neuroimaging and pathological features. SVD has taken precedence as a radiological concept, but refers to an intracranial disorder that encompasses pathological changes within and at the surfaces of brain microvessels including perforating arteries and arterioles, capillaries and venules. SVD involves tissue injury in both the cortical and subcortical grey and white matter (WM). SVD, however, may often coexist with atherosclerosis involving large extracranial vessels and embolic disease.

In this article, I review the brief history of our current understanding of VaD, various criteria incorporating clinical, neuropsychological and pathological features that have been proposed over the years and key vascular lesions and tissue changes, which contribute to dementia. I convey some opinions about brain sampling and consider some of the rarer causes of VCI and VaD and how these can be investigated. It is clear that despite the strong and unambiguous evidence that vascular factors and vascular disease contribute to the global burden of brain disease, dementia prognosis and research has mostly focused on Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Vascular causes of dementia and their contribution to neurodegenerative processes have not been widely emphasised.

### The pathology of "vascular dementia": a critical update [^61fc0bd8]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2008). Low credibility.

The prevalence, morphology and pathogenesis of vascular dementia (VaD), recently termed vascular cognitive disorder (VCD), are a matter of discussion.VaD is suggested in 8-15% of cognitively impaired aged subjects. Its prevalence in autopsy series ranges from 0.03 to 58% (mean 8-15% in Western series, 22-35% in Japan). Neuropathology shows multifocal and/or diffuse lesions, ranging from lacunes and microinfarcts, often involving subcortical and strategically important brain areas (thalamus, frontobasal, limbic system), white matter lesions and hippocampal sclerosis to multi-infarct encephalopathy and diffuse post-ischemic lesions. They result from systemic, cardiac and local large and small vessel disease. Pathogenesis is multifactorial and pathophysiology affects neuronal networks involved in cognition, behavior, execution and memory. Vascular lesions often coexist with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other pathologies. Minor vascular lesions hardly contribute to cognitive decline in full-blown AD, while both mild Alzheimer pathology and small vessel disease interact synergistically. AD pathology is less severe in the presence of vascular lesions. The lesion pattern in "pure" VaD/VCD) related to microangiopathies differs from that in "mixed dementia" (AD + vascular encephalopathy), often associated with large infarcts, suggesting different pathogenesis. Due to the heterogeneity of cerebrovascular pathology and its causative factors, no validated neuropathologic criteria for VaD are currently available, and a large variability across laboratories still exists in morphologic examination procedures and techniques. Further prospective clinico-pathologic studies are needed to validate diagnostic criteria for VaD and to clarify the impact of vascular lesions on cognitive impairment.

### Impact of cerebral small vessel disease on cognitive outcomes in early age at onset MCI and dementia: findings from the DIASPORA study [^228a5f50]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

5 CONCLUSION

This study offers novel insights into the relevance of CSVD to cognitive function and neuropsychiatric symptoms across age groups and dementia subtypes. We found that WMHs and lacunar infarcts are more strongly associated with poor cognition in younger individuals. Further studies are needed to better define the role of CSVD in EO dementia populations, including larger cohorts, longitudinal assessments, and comparing patients with and without cognitive decline within CSVD cohorts. Such work will help clarify causality, progression, and potential treatment windows. Given the substantial personal and societal impact of EO dementias, early identification and strict prevention of CSVD through effective management of vascular risk factors (such as hypertension, diabetes, and smoking) represent important opportunities to mitigate functional decline and preserve quality of life.

### Functional, cognitive, physical, and vascular outcomes 9 years after lacunar and mild cortical ischemic stroke [^5e23ad9f]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) is a leading cause of vascular dementia and cognitive impairment and is associated with lacunar or hemorrhagic stroke, mobility problems, and neuropsychiatric symptoms.Lacunar strokes account for a quarter of all ischemic strokes and are distinctive in their symptomatology.Lacunar infarcts are small (<15 mm in diameter), occur in subcortical regions, and result from disease of a single perforating artery and intrinsic small vessel pathology.

Compared with other stroke subtypes, lacunar stroke is generally considered to have a favorable prognosis, characterized by small infarct size, minimal risk of early death, low early recurrent stroke rates, and typically nondisabling effects in the initial months after stroke. However, the long-term prognosis of lacunar infarction remains less well characterized compared with other stroke subtypes.

Research on lacunar stroke outcomes is limited, with most studies being small with short follow-up periods, rarely extending beyond 4 years.Most studies lack patient-reported measures on well-being and disability. It is important to consider prognosis within a broader context, particularly because lacunar strokes tend to occur at slightly younger ages, are associated with high survival rates, and frequently involve cognitive impairment.Patients with SVD have expressed concerns regarding their long-term prognosis, highlighting a lack of information from health care providers.Longitudinal data on the outcomes of lacunar stroke, and their comparison with similarly mild cortical ischemic stroke, can offer valuable insights to help guide clinical management and inform research priorities.

In this study, we report long-term clinical outcomes, including dementia, recurrent stroke, death, and participant-reported functional and cognitive outcomes, in a prospective study of participants with lacunar ischemic stroke and those with similarly mild cortical ischemic stroke at 9 years after stroke.

### Change in multimodal MRI markers predicts dementia risk in cerebral small vessel disease [^78a28194]. Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) is the major pathology underlying vascular dementia and an important cause of age-related cognitive decline.While many elderly patients develop radiologic signs of SVD,only a minority progress to dementia. Better methods are required to identify the subgroup who rapidly decline.

Using rate of cognitive decline as a predictive tool in SVD has been shown to be limiteddue to the slow rate of declineand insensitivity of cognitive tests to change. Research has therefore focused on using MRI features of SVD, such as lacunes, white matter hyperintensities (WMH), and brain atrophy,, as surrogate markers.Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is of particular interest; it is highly sensitive to white matter (WM) microstructural damage in SVD and demonstrates widespread abnormalities in the apparently normal-appearing WM (NAWM).

Cross-sectional studies have shown that both lacunes and diffuse WM damage detected on DTI are associated with cognitive impairment.It has been hypothesized that both result in white matter track disruption, and disconnection of distributed networks underlying executive function (EF) and processing speed (PS), the 2 domains most affected in SVD. However, almost all previous data are cross-sectional and therefore give information only on association, not prediction. The longitudinal St George's Cognition and Neuroimaging in Stroke (SCANS) study was established to determine whether change in multimodal MRI, including DTI, predicts cognitive decline and dementia in SVD.

### The clinical profile of cerebral small vessel disease: toward an evidence-based identification of cognitive markers [^420a546b]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2023). Medium credibility.

1 NARRATIVE

Cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD) defines a group of diseases that affect small arteries, arterioles, venules, and capillaries of the brain and encompasses several pathological processes and etiologies.The sporadic age‐related cSVD type is the most frequent, but genetic forms such as cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) also exist.Stroke, cognitive decline, and disability are major consequences of cSVD.At present, the lack of specific preventive and therapeutic approaches does not allow reduction of the burden of these clinical sequelae.

As in other dementing conditions, the range of cognitive deficit severity in cSVD comprises a spectrum extending from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to dementia.Some cSVD patients may even be totally asymptomatic from the cognitive point of view. In patients with cSVD, the pattern of cognitive deficits seems to involve information processing; ability to focus, maintain, or shift attention; and ability to manipulate, organize, and select information.Despite the common belief that the cognitive profile of cSVD is mainly characterized by attentional and executive dysfunctions, evidence for this is still scarce, and therefore efforts are needed to clarify the potential of available neuropsychological tests in identifying cSVD patients.

1.1 In search of a cognitive marker for cerebral small vessel diseases

Over the past several years, there has been a great effort to define cSVD in vivo and this has resulted in significant attention on neuroimaging markers so that today cSVD is mainly diagnosed and identified through neuroimaging, mostly magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), rather than clinically.One of the reasons for this is that neuroimaging has become widely available although it is not specific. Considering specificity, great efforts have been made in the last decade to standardize and harmonize neuroimaging aspects of cSVD.On the other hand, the clinical profile of cSVD has received less attention and remains incompletely elucidated. This is particularly true for the cognitive profile of cSVD patients.

Generally speaking, cognitive assessment has both the potential to establish the presence and degree of cognitive impairment (diagnostic value) and to identify the underlying disease process (differential diagnostic value).The use of neuropsychological findings to characterize the clinical profiles of different dementing conditions could be a cost‐effective screening strategy, particularly if disease‐specific therapeutic approaches become available.

### Chronic kidney disease and its association with cerebral small vessel disease in the general older hypertensive population [^fe98e8ae]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) includes pathologies of the small vessels in the brain, including small arteries, arterioles, venules, and capillaries. These pathologies are diagnosed and identified on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as white matter hyperintensities (WMHs), lacunar infarcts, cerebral microbleeds (CMBs), brain atrophy, recent small subcortical infarcts, and perivascular spaces. CSVD is an important cause of cognitive decline, dementia, stroke, and functional impairment. Although the prevalence of CSVD varies between studies, it increases with age and is very common in the older population. For example, the prevalence of CMBs has been estimated to increase from 7% in people 45–50 years to 36% in people ≥ 80 years. The prevalence of lacunar infarcts has been estimated to increase from 22% at age 75 years to 32% at age 80 years.

### Update on vascular cognitive impairment associated with subcortical small-vessel disease [^39e15225]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2018). Low credibility.

AD and VCI are the most common causes of cognitive impairment in the elderly, accounting together for more than 70–75% of cases. They also share common risk factors and mechanisms including atherosclerosis, diabetes, and amyloid angiopathy. Vascular comorbidity may be present in 30–60% of AD patients, while AD pathology may be present in 40–80% of VCI patients. Indeed, the coexistence of the two disorders, termed mixed dementia (MXD), may be more common than “pure” AD or “pure” VCI ; moreover, microscopic cortical infarcts, which are not visualized in neuroimaging, may contribute up to 1/5 to 1/3 in the variability of severity of cognitive impairment.

Neuropathology usually provides the final and definite diagnosis in clinical neurology. Therefore, there is unanimous accord that the clinical classification of cerebral small-vessel diseases should be based on the distinct neuropathological lesions. Given the fact that VCI may be the result of a number of cerebrovascular pathologies (Fig. 1) resulting from numerous etiopathogenic causes (Table 1), the occurrence of several clinical forms of VCI (Table 2) is therefore understandable. Among the sporadic forms of VCI, particular attention over the last decades has been paid to post-stroke-associated cognitive impairment or post-stroke dementia (PSD); and, more recently to VCI associated with subcortical small-vessel disease (SSVD), a condition that we last reviewed over a decade ago. Although small-vessel disease may cause cortical atrophy (cortical granular degeneration), and secondary localized atrophy from subcortical lacunar strokes, from the clinical viewpoint, however, most cases of cortical atrophy in elderly patients with cognitive impairment are the result of neurodegenerative conditions, not vascular disease. Thus, when approaching such patients with cognitive loss clinicians rely on the presence of “cortical” versus “subcortical” manifestations that allow a first diagnostic impression. These clinical features are confirmed subsequently by neuropsychological tests, brain imaging, and eventually by neuropathology. Therefore, we decided to maintain the time-honored name “subcortical” in the overall approach to this topic.

### The overlap between vascular disease and Alzheimer's disease – lessons from pathology [^34cf7308]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Recent epidemiological and clinico-pathological data indicate considerable overlap between cerebrovascular disease (CVD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) and suggest additive or synergistic effects of both pathologies on cognitive decline. The most frequent vascular pathologies in the aging brain and in AD are cerebral amyloid angiopathy and small vessel disease. Up to 84% of aged subjects show morphological substrates of CVD in addition to AD pathology. AD brains with minor CVD, similar to pure vascular dementia, show subcortical vascular lesions in about two-thirds, while in mixed type dementia (AD plus vascular dementia), multiple larger infarcts are more frequent. Small infarcts in patients with full-blown AD have no impact on cognitive decline but are overwhelmed by the severity of Alzheimer pathology, while in early stages of AD, cerebrovascular lesions may influence and promote cognitive impairment, lowering the threshold for clinically overt dementia. Further studies are warranted to elucidate the many hitherto unanswered questions regarding the overlap between CVD and AD as well as the impact of both CVD and AD pathologies on the development and progression of dementia.

Neuroimaging of vascular changes

Structural neuroimaging techniques are of pivotal importance for the differential diagnosis of VaD, but also for elucidating the pathophysiological mechanisms surrounding the development of small vascular lesions in brain aging. In routine clinical settings, computed tomography (CT) and MRI provide evidence of vascular lesions that are rarely specific of a given diagnostic entity with the marked exception of cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leucoencephalopathy (CADASIL). In CADASIL, there are subcortical white matter lesions affecting the temporal pole and hyperintensity signals on T2-weighted images mainly in pons in the absence of low intensity T1 signals in deep brain stem and cerebellum.

Besides these rare cases, it is well established that most clinically overt VCI cases evolve progressively over several years via the accumulation of small vascular and microvascular lesions, mainly in subcortical regions. Subsequently, the construct of VCI has been proposed to capture the entire spectrum of cognitive disorders associated with all forms of cerebral vascular brain injury, not solely stroke, ranging from mild cognitive impairment through to fully developed dementia. As already proposed by the NINDS-AIREN criteria and subsequently confirmed by neuroimaging studies, a substantial percentage of VaD cases is due to SVD affecting small cerebral arterioles, capillaries and venules possibly due to intrinsic arteriolar occlusive disorder. Although the small vessels are not easily identifiable, detailed neuroimaging may allow for tracking of their pathology in the human brain. The main imaging features of SVD visible on 1.5 T and 3 T MRI scans are acute lacunar infarcts, neurologically silent lacunes, white matter hyperintensities, increased perivascular spaces and microbleeds (Figs. 2 and 3). Microinfarcts are strongly related to cognitive decline, yet they are detectable only at higher field strengths, usually only available in research facilities. Lacunar strokes correspond to lesions less than 20 mm in axial diameter; old lacunes are small cavities between 3 and 15 mm in diameter located in the deep grey or white matter. Both these lesions are known to affect cognition, mainly in pure VaD cases. On MRI scans, they are detected by increased signal on diffusion-weighted imaging, reduced signal on an apparent diffusion coefficient map, increased signal on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery, increased T2-weighted imaging, reduced signal on T1-weighted MRI, and low attenuation on CT scanning. White matter hyperintensities are areas of decreased attenuation in CT scans, increased signal on T2 and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequences, and in some cases decreased on T1-weighted MRI scans. Present in periventricular and deep white matter, in the basal ganglia (deep grey matter) and more rarely in pons and cerebellum, they signal the progression of SVD and their severity is related to the emergence of VaD in clinical samples. Increased perivascular spaces are visible on T2- and T1-weighted MRI scans mostly in basal ganglia and subcortical white matter. Strongly related to white matter hyperintensities, they are very frequent in old age but the increase of their number is related to VCI. Finally, cortical microbleeds are punctiform areas of hypointensity on T2- or susceptibility-weighted sequences, of up to 1 cm of diameter. An impressive number of studies have attempted to define their cognitive significance with conflicting results ; their negative impact on cognition is highly likely in VaD, but much less in mixed cases.

### Microvascular pathology and morphometrics of sporadic and hereditary small vessel diseases of the brain [^46e47b8e]. Brain Pathology (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Small vessel disease (SVD) of the brain is common in community‐dwelling elderly subjects 81, 93, 96. It is now widely accepted that subcortical ischemic vascular dementia (VaD) results from SVD 90, 94. The pathogenesis of SVD is still relatively poorly understood and therapeutic strategies are limited. Neuroradiologically, SVD is recognized by focal ischemic lesions or lacunes in the subcortical structures and by diffuse white matter hyperintensities on T2‐weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) described as leukoaraiosis 90, 97. Patients with SVD exhibit motor and executive slowing, forgetfulness and dysarthria. A short‐stepped gait is also common and can mimic that of Parkinsonism. These may be caused by disruption of pathways running from the prefrontal cortex to the basal ganglia and of thalamocortical pathways 94. “Pure” subcortical VaD with a slowly progressive course may mimic Alzheimer's disease (AD) but in the general absence of the characteristic brain neurofibrillary burden. The main vascular pathological features involve sclerotic changes in intracranial arteries and arterioles, whereas parenchymal lesions in the subcortical structures largely involve lacunar infarcts, microinfarcts, increased perivascular spacing and deep white matter (WM) attenuation (Table 1). However, small infarcts or microinfarcts and tissue thinning may also occur in the cortex. Highly specific categories of subcortical VaD may be due to infarctions located in the thalamus with relatively little involvement of other brain structures 15.

Mild cognitive impairment may not be a separate category of disturbance, such as age-associated or age-appropriate memory loss, but is rather on a continuum between healthy and dementia.

### Vascular cognitive impairment and dementia in old age: cognition and beyond [^81f3b1e1]. Age and Ageing (2025). Medium credibility.

Vascular cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID) is common in the ageing population. VCID is often the cause of alterations in vascular perfusion or function, reflected for example in strokes, haemorrhages, and small vessel disease. The risk of developing VCID is accelerated by the presence of cardiovascular risk factors like hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, smoking, and atrial fibrillation. Symptoms of VCID vary depending on the brain regions affected and the extent of blood flow disruption. Common early signs include slowed thinking, difficulty planning or organizing, trouble concentrating, confusion, and changes in mood or behaviour. Motor function disturbances in gait and balance are increasingly recognized as early features, and functional consequences may well be aggravated in the presence of multi-domain impairment in motor function as well as cognition. While some patients experience sudden onset of these symptoms following a cerebrovascular event, many experience a gradual progression of symptoms due to cerebral small vessel damage. In the absence of a cure for VCID, emphasis on clinical treatment is on timely preventive interventions as well as supportive care and management. The collection of selected studies on VCID published in Age and Ageing provides an overview of the impact of modifiable risk factors on motor function impairment as well as cognitive symptoms, and points towards developments in preventative risk factor management and recent combined cognitive-motor interventions aimed at maintaining cognitive and functional ability.

### Neuroimaging studies on cognitive impairment due to cerebral small vessel disease [^14cdc3af]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusions and future perspectives

VCI is a major contributor to age-related dementing illnesses. CSVD is the leading cause of VCI which presents with predominant disruption of attention and executive function. It is particularly important for early detection and prevention since no specific treatment has been found to be effective until now. Multimodal neuroimaging techniques are currently important investigation tools in clinical studies. Brain network characters are now emerging as sensitive markers in cognitive deterioration in CSVD. Advanced structural with functional brain network analysis on longitudinal cohorts with different clinical settings are needed to explore the mechanism of VCI in CSVD in the future.

### Baseline predictors of cognitive decline in patients with cerebral small vessel disease [^ec903881]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) is a common cause of cognitive impairment and vascular dementia.

Objective

We aimed to investigate predictors of cognitive decline in patients with SVD who initially presented with first-ever small subcortical stroke of lacunar type but had normal cognitive status.

Methods

A total of 294 patients with SVD were evaluated 3-5 years after initial presentation. We analyzed baseline demographic data, vascular risk factors, functional status expressed as score on modified Rankin Scale, total number of lacunar infarcts, and severity of white matter hyperintensities (WMH) on magnetic resonance imaging with Age-Related White Matter Changes scale total score (tARWMC) and Fazekas scale periventricular and deep subcortical scores.

Results

At follow-up, vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) on any type was detected in 188 (63.9%) of SVD patients, with 65 (22.1%) meeting criteria for vascular dementia and 123 (41.8%) presenting with cognitive impairment not dementia. Patients with VCI were older (64.4 ± 10.3 in VCI versus 58.6 ± 10.5 years in non-VCI; p < 0.0001) at the time of initial clinical presentation and more frequently male (57.9% VCI versus 46.2% non-VCI; p = 0.052). No difference was noted in frequency of vascular risk factors in VCI versus non-VCI cases. Multivariate logistic regression analysis adjusted by age and gender identified overall severity of WMH (tARWMC HR 1.42, 95% CI 1.01-2.00; p0.043) and total number of lacunar infarcts (HR 3.06, 95% CI 1.71-5.50, p < 0.001) as independent predictors of cognitive decline.

Conclusion

In patients with SVD, independent predictors of VCI were baseline severity of WMH and total number of lacunar infarcts.

### Neuropathological diagnosis of vascular cognitive impairment and vascular dementia with implications for Alzheimer's disease [^00cd380d]. Acta Neuropathologica (2016). Low credibility.

Summary

Defining the neuropathological substrates of VaD relies on uniformity in sampling and careful pathological examination. VaD resulting from severe VCI or vascular cognitive disorder or from delayed impairment after stroke appears to result from the accumulation of several lesions including cerebral atrophy. While robust neuropathological criteria for VaD are still being developed, multiple microinfarcts, small infarcts or lacunes in the subcortical structures rather than macroinfarction or large vessel disease appear most robustly related to cognitive impairment. Diffuse WM changes involving periventricular and deeper regions are frequent in VaD. Concomitant hippocampal pathology including sclerosis and Alzheimer pathology compound disease progression. Further definitions of the neuropathological correlates of VaD and investigation of genetic models would be valuable for exploring the pathogenesis as well as management of VaD through preventative and treatment strategies.

### Vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) [^8344fe35]. Neurotherapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

Vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) is predominately caused by vascular risk factors and cerebrovascular disease. VCI includes a broad spectrum of cognitive disorders, from mild cognitive impairment to vascular dementia caused by ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, and vascular factors alone or in a combination with neurodegeneration including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and AD-related dementia. VCI accounts for at least 20-40% of all dementia diagnosis. Growing evidence indicates that cerebrovascular pathology is the most important contributor to dementia, with additive or synergistic interactions with neurodegenerative pathology. The most common underlying mechanism of VCI is chronic age-related dysregulation of CBF, although other factors such as inflammation and cardiovascular dysfunction play a role. Vascular risk factors are prevalent in VCI and if measured in midlife they predict cognitive impairment and dementia in later life. Particularly, hypertension, high cholesterol, diabetes, and smoking at midlife are each associated with a 20 to 40% increased risk of dementia. Control of these risk factors including multimodality strategies with an inclusion of lifestyle modification is the most promising strategy for treatment and prevention of VCI. In this review, we present recent developments in age-related VCI, its mechanisms, diagnostic criteria, neuroimaging correlates, vascular risk determinants, and current intervention strategies for prevention and treatment of VCI. We have also summarized the most recent and relevant literature in the field of VCI.

### Cognitive impairment after ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^83549522]. Stroke (2023). High credibility.

Risk factors for poststroke cognitive impairment (PSCI) include prestroke cognitive decline, preexisting cerebral vulnerability or reduced reserve, and the impact of the stroke, with a minor stroke potentially precipitating dementia in an older person with a vulnerable brain; key vulnerability factors include age, cerebral small-vessel disease, and neurodegeneration, which may be partially mitigated by higher educational attainment and premorbid intelligence; comorbid poststroke depression is an important factor that frequently coexists with PSCI; the risk associated with late-life vascular factors is unclear except for diabetes, which has been associated with an increased risk; strong social networks may be protective although evidence specific to PSCI is sparse; PSCI is more common with higher stroke lesion load such as in severe or recurrent strokes, and risk varies by stroke subtype, being higher in hemorrhagic and cardioembolic stroke compared with lacunar stroke, likely driven partially by corresponding stroke severity.

Plain English summary of protocol Background and study aims About 35, 000 people each year in the UK have a type of stroke, called ‘lacunar’ or ‘small vessel’ stroke, which is different to other common types of stroke and for which there is no proven treatment. There is some evidence to suggest that small vessel stroke is caused by damage to. the lining of the tiny blood vessels in the brain that stops the vessels functioning normally and damages the brain. This damage not only causes stroke, but it also causes problems with thinking and walking. It is possible that damage to the small blood vessels of the brain causes up to 40% of all dementias. Some drugs that are commonly used in other blood vessel diseases may. prevent worsening of small vessel disease. Who can participate.

### Antihypertensive treatment can prevent stroke and cognitive decline [^6f309df9]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2013). Medium credibility.

Hypertension is a highly prevalent risk factor for stroke and dementia, and is the greatest risk factor for small-vessel disease-a frequent cause of lacunar infarction and intracerebral haemorrhage. Lacunar and cortical strokes contribute to the development of dementia in patients with, and in those without, Alzheimer disease pathology; this relationship between stroke and dementia is probably mediated by ischaemia-induced neuroinflammation. Antihypertensive treatment can reduce the risk of stroke and dementia, but requires optimal blood pressure targets to be established for individual patients. Although the rate of treatment and control of hypertension has improved markedly over the past two decades, many physicians remain reluctant to prescribe antihypertensive medication to elderly patients owing to potential adverse events such as cardiovascular morbidity and postural hypotension. In this article we argue that, in patients of all ages, not treating hypertension is a missed opportunity to prevent some of the most prevalent brain diseases.

### Cerebral small vessel disease and vascular cognitive impairment: from diagnosis to management [^cf49abac]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Cognitive profile

Cognitive decline linked to cerebrovascular diseases, including SVD, is thought to typically present in a stepwise and gradual pattern, progressing slowly and affecting processing speed, complex attention and frontal-executive functions. Disturbances in the frontal-executive domain are considered more likely to be present in mild VCI than in Alzheimer's disease related mild cognitive impairment (MCI), in which decline in episodic memory is the most prominent feature.

This observed predilection for impairment of frontal-executive functions is thought to result from the disruptive effect of SVD lesions on the brain's structural and functional connectivity. Neuroimaging studies have shown that the degree of structural network disruption is associated with the burden and extent of SVD lesions and, at least in part, mediates their association with cognitive decline. Also, functional networks associated with attention and executive functions have been found to be predominantly affected in SVD patients.

Traditionally, a history of early onset of memory deficit and worsening of cortical functions (aphasia, apraxia, agnosia), in the absence of corresponding vascular brain imaging lesions, can be suggestive of Alzheimer's disease as primary diagnosis. Nonetheless, episodic and semantic memory can also be affected in cognitive impairment of presumably vascular origin.

Importantly, there is much overlap in cognitive profiles across dementia types, possibly related to the multifactorial nature of age-related cognitive decline combined with patient-specific factors related to cognitive reserve and spatial distribution of vascular lesions.

Accordingly, recent findings support a much more heterogeneous spectrum of cognitive impairment related to SVD. This suggests that multiple domains can be affected, owing not only to overlapping diseases but also to close interdependence of executive function and processing speed to perform fluid cognitive tasks. Interestingly, in severe CAA cases, visuospatial dysfunction has also been reported, hypothesized to relate to a posterior predominance of amyloid disease.

### Determinants and temporal dynamics of cerebral small vessel disease: 14-year follow-up [^21a16539]. Stroke (2022). Medium credibility.

Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) is the most important vascular contributor to dementia and accounts for up to a fifth of all stroke worldwide.White matter hyperintensities (WMH) and lacunes of presumed vascular origin are hallmark lesions of SVD on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Progression of these lesions is associated with poor functional outcomes, including cognitive decline,gait dysfunction, – and depression.Vascular risk factors and baseline severity of SVD have been identified as determinants of SVD progression. – However, this may be different for rapid and slow progressors and for early- or late-stage disease. Besides, it is still unknown whether vascular risk factors and SVD lesions at baseline affect the long-term SVD changes independently or in interaction.

Emerging evidence has shown regression in some SVD patients.– However, our understanding of individual temporal course of SVD MRI markers and the identification of the individuals at risk of rapid progression and regression is limited. Because most studies had a relatively short duration of follow-up (no more than 6 years) with usually only a baseline and one follow-up scan, which does not allow for the identification of regression alternated by progression.

Therefore, studies with a longer follow-up and serial follow-up MRI scans are warranted to comprehensively investigate the temporal dynamics of SVD and its determinants. We investigated the temporal course of WMH and lacunes, as markers of SVD, by 4 consecutive neuroimaging assessments over 14 years in older patients with sporadic SVD. In addition, we examined the effect of vascular risk factors, SVD burden at baseline, and their interaction with the long-term temporal dynamics.

### Progression of leukoaraiosis and cognition [^ccf56454]. Stroke (2007). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Leukoaraiosis is used interchangeably with the term white matter lesions on MRI and seen to some degree in more than half of the routine scans in older persons. Clinicians often struggle to explain the implications of these findings to their patients. Recent data on the progression rate of ischemic white matter damage and its cognitive consequences may help in patient counseling and have implications on treatment trials in vascular cognitive impairment. Summary of Review-Leukoaraiosis progresses over time. Its extent at baseline is an important predictor for the subsequent rate of lesion progression. Subjects with punctate abnormalities on MRI have a low tendency for progression, individuals with early confluent and confluent changes tend to progress rapidly. Differences in measurement methods and cohort composition make it difficult to compare progression rates reported by different studies. Nevertheless, in community-dwelling cohorts, white matter lesions volume increased by as much as one quarter per year in subjects with confluent abnormalities at baseline. Progression of leukoaraiosis relates to cognitive decline, but this association is complex and modulated by other morphological factors like brain atrophy.

Conclusions

Evidence for rapid progression of widespread leukoaraiosis and the associated cognitive decline in domains particularly affected by cerebral small vessel disease has set the stage for exploratory clinical trials in vascular cognitive impairment using white matter lesions progression as a surrogate marker.

### Cardiovascular risk factors and brain health: impact on long-range cortical connections and cognitive performance [^a6268959]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Brain health can be broadly defined as the physiological state in which sensorimotor and cognitive tasks are performed within a normal level that is comparable across healthy individuals. This definition can also be expanded to imply neurological functional reserve, that is, the ability to learn and adapt to new knowledge and challenges or to recover from neurological disease.

Currently, brain health is largely assessed in the context of clinical neuroscience through behavioral measures. Cognitive performance is assessed using standard paper‐and‐pencil neuropsychological tests, whereas sensorimotor abilities are commonly assessed through a neurological examination. 1, 2 Likewise, neurological adaptation is measured through observation of learning rates or through recovery after brain injury. 3, 4, 5

These behavioral measures provide some insight into the underlying biological phenomena that are fundamentally related to brain health. However, behavioral measures do not yield specific information about the exact underlying neuroanatomical mechanisms that constitute brain health and, as a result, are limited in their ability to predict performance or reserve, particularly in the context of neurological disease and subclinical changes, where identifying compromised neuroanatomical networks can be important for treatment considerations.

Cardiovascular risk factors, such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia are detrimental to general health and to cognition in particular. They have pervasive and profound effects on end‐organ function and peripheral vasculature. 6 Cardiovascular risk factors result in initial subtle brain structural changes and cognitive decline that may eventually lead to dementia. 7, 8 Likewise, the cumulative effects of microangiopathic changes and perivascular lipohyalinosis are commonly associated with white matter changes in the brain. 9 Although white matter has lower metabolic needs, it is significantly more vulnerable to ischemic damage compared with gray matter. White matter receives less cerebrovascular perfusion 10 and has a declining anaerobic resistance associated with aging. 11 Despite the well‐known relationship between white matter susceptibility and ischemic damage, the mechanisms linking small‐vessel disease, white matter network disruption, brain health, and cognitive decline are not well understood. Likewise, the impact of microangiopathic white matter loss on cognitive performance is not well defined in mild to moderate cases. Therefore, evidence of premorbid brain decline coupled with changes in brain structural integrity may be an early indicator of cognitive decline and dementia.

### The pathology of ischemic-vascular dementia: an update [^6d403aff]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2002). Low credibility.

In Western memory clinic-based series, ischemic-vascular dementia (IVD) is seen in 8-10% of cognitively impaired elderly subjects. Its prevalence in autopsy series ranges from 0.03% to 58% with reasonable values of 4-10%, while in Japan, IVD is seen in 22-35% and mixed-type dementia (MTD) (Alzheimer disease/AD+IVD) in 6-11%. In a large Viennese autopsy series, "pure" IVD was observed in 9.4% of demented elderly and in 2.9% of those clinically diagnosed as possible/probable AD MTD was observed in 3.1% and 1.3% respectively. The major morphological types of IVD are multi-infarct encephalopathy (MIE), small vessel infarct type-strategic infarct dementia (SID), subcortical arteriosclerotic leukoencephalopathy (Binswanger), multilacunar state, mixed cortico-subcortical type, granular cortical atrophy, and post-ischemic encephalopathy. In contrast to previous suggestions that IVD is mainly the result of large hemispheral infarcts or losses of over 100 ml of brain tissue, recent data indicate that cognitive decline is commonly associated with widespread small ischemic or vascular lesions (microinfarcts, lacunes) throughout the brain with predominant involvement of the basal ganglia, white matter, and hippocampus. The lesion pattern of "pure" IVD, which is related to arteriolosclerosis and hypertensive microangiopathy, differs from that in mixed-type dementia, more often showing large infarcts. Although recent studies suggest that concomitant small cerebral infarcts do not significantly influence the overall rate of cognitive decline in AD patients or may be important for mental decline in early AD, both mild AD pathology and microvascular cerebral lesions appear to be common and may interact in "unmasking" or promoting dementia.

### Relation of cerebral vessel disease to Alzheimer's disease dementia and cognitive function in elderly people: a cross-sectional study [^7670eee8]. The Lancet: Neurology (2016). Medium credibility.

Neuropathologic data

Each autopsied brain underwent a systematic neuropathologic evaluation, blinded to clinical data, as previously published.Briefly, a uniform gross and histologic evaluation for common age-related pathologies is conducted, and includes a detailed assessment of cerebrovascular disease.

Cerebral vessel disease is documented in large and small vessels. Atherosclerosis describes the segmental or circumferential subintimal accumulation of lipid, plasma proteins, and calcium deposition (plaque) in the walls of large arteries and was assessed on gross examination, by visual inspection of vessels in the Circle of Willis. Vessels included the vertebral, basilar, posterior cerebral, middle cerebral, and anterior cerebral arteries and their proximal branches. Severity was graded using a semi-quantitative scale, based on involvement of each artery and number of arteries involved, from 0 (no atherosclerosis) to 6 (severe atherosclerosis, with all visualized large arteries affected or one artery completely occluded). Arteriolosclerosis describes concentric hyaline thickening of small vessel walls, with emphasis placed on arterioles less than 50 microns. Arteriolosclerosis was documented on the histologic examination, by using H&E stained sections of the anterior basal ganglia (caudate, putamen, globus pallidus, and internal capsule). Severity was also graded based on vessel wall thickening, and ranged from 0 (no arteriolosclerosis) to 7 (complete small vessel occlusion), as described elsewhere.In analyses for this study, the severity of both vessel pathologies was grouped into four levels for primary analyses (not present, mild, moderate, and severe), and in some other analyses, into two levels (moderate-to-severe, versus not present-to-mild).

Neuropathologic data also included systematic assessment for other common cerebral vascular disease and neurodegenerative diseases, and have been published elsewhere. In summary, gross (macroscopic) infarcts were identified on gross examination, and classified by number, volume (in mm 2) and location, and each infarct was then dissected and confirmed on microscopic examination using H&E, and classified by age (chronic, subacute, acute).Microinfarcts, defined as infarcts not visible to the naked eye and identified only under microscopy, were identified in blocks of nine brain regions that were paraffin embedded and stained with H&E.Location and age of microinfarcts were also recorded. For this study, only chronic gross and micro-infarcts were considered, and all infarct variables were dichotomized into present (one or more) vs. absent (none, as reference group).

### Methods of a study to assess the contribution of cerebral small vessel disease and dementia risk alleles to racial disparities in vascular cognitive impairment and dementia [^c5378e00]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Background Non-Hispanic Black adults have a higher proportion of vascular cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease and related dementias compared with non-Hispanic White adults that may be due to differences in the burden of cerebral small vessel disease and risk alleles for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. We describe here the methods of an ancillary study to the REGARDS (Reason for Geographic and and Racial Difference in Stroke) study, which will examine the role of magnetic resonance imaging markers of cerebral small vessel disease and vascular as well as genetic risk factors for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias in racial disparity in the prevalence and trajectory of vascular cognitive impairment and dementia in non-Hispanic White and non-Hispanic Black participants. Methods In participants with no prior history of stroke who had an incident stroke or transient ischemic attack after enrollment in the study, magnetic resonance imaging scans will be evaluated using the Standards for Reporting Vascular Changes on Neuroimaging international consensus criteria and automated analysis pipelines for quantification of cerebral small vessel disease. Participants will be genotyped for APOE ε4 and TREM2 risk alleles for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. The 6-item screener will define global cognitive function and be the primary cognitive outcome. Conclusions With at least 426 non-Hispanic Black and 463 non-Hispanic White participants who have at least 2 prior and 2 poststroke or transient ischemic attack cognitive assessments, we will have at least 80% power to detect a minimum effect size of 0.09 SD change in Z score, with correction for as many as 20 tests (ie, at P <0.0025, after adjusting for up to 20 covariates) for cognitive decline.

New Opportunities for Trials in VCI

Our view is that the time is ripe for a new generation of VCI trials exploiting advances in diagnosis, outcome measurement, neuroimaging biomarkers, and trial design methodology, and a growing understanding of the pathobiology of vascular contributions to neurodegeneration (Table).

Table 1 
Considerations for Improving the Quality of Trials in Patients With VCI

Trials should aim to improve cognition, daily function, and quality of life by targeting specific, prespecified mechanisms of impairment using appropriate diagnostic criteria and, when available, appropriate biomarkers for patient identification, target engagement, and outcomes. It is important to recognize that VCI is a syndrome, not a disease. Essentially any cerebrovascular disease that destroys brain can lead to VCI. Trial interventions should target not just a diagnostic syndrome but rather a specific mechanism of disease, brain injury, accommodation, or recovery in an appropriate population. 47

Patient Selection

Patients should be selected using modern diagnostic criteria with neuroimaging confirmation of cerebrovascular disease or related brain injury. 5, 6, 7 The Standards for Reporting Vascular Changes on Neuroimaging provides consensus definitions for infarcts, WMHs of presumed vascular origin, microbleeds, enlarged perivascular spaces and brain atrophy, as well as suggestions for MRI acquisition protocols. 12 Further validation work on the reliability of these criteria and standards in clinical and research practice would be welcome.

VCI caused by cerebral small vessel disease may be the most important target for future RCTs. Reducing the progression of cerebral small vessel disease and its impact on cognition and risk for dementia would produce large public health benefits. Neuropathology studies show that cerebral small vessel disease, predominantly in the absence of a clinical history of stroke, is found in most cases of dementia. 48 It accounts for approximately one quarter to one third of the population‐attributable risk for dementia. 49, 50 The majority of cerebral small vessel disease is caused by arteriolosclerosis because of aging, hypertension, and conventional vascular risk factors, while a minority is caused by vascular beta‐amyloid deposition (that is, cerebral amyloid angiopathy). The International Society for Vascular Behavioral and Cognitive Disorders has offered neuroimaging criteria for cerebral small vessel disease sufficient to cause vascular MCI or dementia. 6 Further refinement and validation of neuroimaging criteria for vascular MCI and dementia would be helpful.

### Cerebral small vessel disease, hypertension, and vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia [^c8d4461d]. Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Hypertension-associated cerebral small vessel disease is a common finding in older people. Strongly associated with age and hypertension, small vessel disease is found at autopsy in over 50% of people aged ≥65 years, with a spectrum of clinical manifestations. It is the main cause of lacunar stroke and a major source of vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia. The brain areas affected are subcortical and periventricular white matter and deep gray nuclei. Neuropathological sequelae are diffuse white matter lesions (seen as white matter hyperintensities on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging), small ischemic foci (lacunes or microinfarcts), and less commonly, subcortical microhemorrhages. The most common form of cerebral small vessel disease is concentric, fibrotic thickening of small penetrating arteries (up to 300 microns outer diameter) termed arteriolosclerosis. Less common forms are small artery atheroma and lipohyalinosis (the lesions described by C. Miller Fisher adjacent to lacunes). Other microvascular lesions that are not reviewed here include cerebral amyloid angiopathy and venous collagenosis. Here, we review the epidemiology, neuropathology, clinical management, genetics, preclinical models, and pathogenesis of hypertensive small vessel disease. Knowledge gaps include initiating factors, molecular pathogenesis, relationships between arterial pathology and tissue damage, possible reversibility, pharmacological targets, and molecular biomarkers. Progress is anticipated from multicell transcriptomic and proteomic profiling, novel experimental models and further target-finding and interventional clinical studies.

Neuropathology: vascular dementia versus dementia with mixed pathologies

It has to be emphasised that the neuropathological diagnosis of VaD remains challenging in the absence of commonly accepted neuropathological criteria.Three main diseases of cerebral blood vessels can contribute to vascular dementia, namely atherosclerosis (AS; large- to medium-sized arteries), SVD (small arteries and arterioles) and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA; arteries, capillaries and rarely veins). AS, SVD and CAA can cause different types of cerebrovascular lesions, including brain infarcts, white matter lesions and cerebral haemorrhages (Fig. 1). Large infarcts can be caused by thrombotic (AS) or thromboembolic (AS, extracranial AS, cardiogenic) occlusion of the vessel’s lumen. Lacunar infarcts are frequently caused by SVD-related vessel occlusion and microinfarcts are often related to SVD (white matter) and CAA (cortex). Based on the pattern of cerebrovascular lesions, three types of dementias associated with cerebrovascular disease may be distinguished, namely multi-infarct dementia, strategic infarct dementia and subcortical vascular encephalopathy (Binswanger’s disease).
