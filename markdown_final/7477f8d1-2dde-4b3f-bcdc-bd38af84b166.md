## Question

In a 28-year-old woman with knee injuries, should an MRI be obtained both with and without contrast?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a knee MRI for a 28-year-old woman with an acute traumatic knee injury should be obtained with and without gadolinium contrast, or if non-contrast MRI is sufficient. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about guideline-recommended imaging pathways for acute knee trauma. Then, I should verify the diagnostic performance of standard non-contrast MRI for meniscal, ligamentous, and chondral injuries. Next, I will examine the specific, limited scenarios where intravenous contrast meaningfully adds value. After that, I need to weigh any incremental benefit against added time, cost, and downstream appropriateness concerns. Finally, I will synthesize a clear recommendation consistent with AAOS and ACR guidance and the diagnostic-accuracy literature.

> Let me first confirm the imaging pathway. In acute knee trauma, radiographs come first when indicated, and MRI is the next-line test for suspected internal derangement or occult fracture if radiographs are negative or non-diagnostic; critically, these recommendations do not call for routine gadolinium administration for traumatic internal derangements in otherwise healthy adults, and they do not specify "with and without contrast" as standard practice for this indication [^114iYWBA] [^114Yt4JW]. The AAOS meniscal guideline explicitly recommends MRI as the preferred imaging modality for acute meniscal tears because of high diagnostic accuracy, again without recommending contrast for routine traumatic evaluations [^115a728T]. For chronic knee pain, ACR similarly positions MRI as a problem-solving tool after non-diagnostic radiographs, without routine contrast for degenerative or internal derangement patterns [^1162rmm9].

> I need to verify how good non-contrast MRI actually is for the typical traumatic targets here. The high-quality meta-analysis shows pooled sensitivity/specificity of approximately 87%/93% for ACL tears, 89%/88% for medial meniscal tears, and 78%/95% for lateral meniscal tears using standard, non-contrast MRI; field strength did not significantly modify accuracy, supporting robust performance without gadolinium in this context [^115ijErj]. Wait, let me double-check broader practice trends: non-contrast MRI at 1.5 T and 3 T has effectively replaced many diagnostic knee arthroscopies for internal derangements, reinforcing the adequacy of non-contrast protocols for traumatic knee assessment [^113GDJYo].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should consider whether contrast improves detection of chondral lesions enough to matter. An older prospective study comparing non-contrast versus gadolinium-enhanced protocols showed similarly modest sensitivities for cartilage lesions, without a meaningful advantage to contrast in routine practice, which tempers the idea that contrast would improve typical traumatic derangement detection in a young adult [^notfound]. Let me think about protocol guidance too: contemporary practice recommendations emphasize fluid-sensitive and T1-weighted sequences as the essential backbone of a basic knee protocol, not routine IV contrast for acute trauma assessments [^115gfjP5].

> Next, I should review when contrast is actually indicated. I need to check scenarios such as inflammatory synovitis, postoperative cartilage repair assessment, infection, tumor, or vascular injury. In inflammatory arthritis such as juvenile idiopathic arthritis, contrast can aid synovitis scoring, highlighting that enhancement targets a different pathophysiologic question than acute traumatic derangement in a healthy adult [^114WspaJ]. For postoperative cartilage repair such as autologous chondrocyte implantation, contrast-enhanced high-resolution MRI can improve delineation of graft morphology, which again is a postoperative, not acute-trauma, indication [^114YUE25]. For severe trauma with possible vascular injury, I initially thought MR angiography might be necessary, but wait, I should verify ACR's stance: for significant knee trauma, CTA is often the initial vascular study, with MR angiography as a consideration in certain circumstances, indicating this is a different diagnostic pathway than routine internal derangement imaging after minor trauma [^116dvB9a] [^113NbbdT].

> I should also weigh added value versus cost and workflow impact. Adding a contrast series increases scan time and resource use, and there is no high-credibility evidence of improved diagnostic accuracy for typical traumatic internal derangement when gadolinium is added to a standard knee protocol in a healthy young adult; moreover, system-level work shows efforts to curb unnecessary knee MRI use and associated costs, reinforcing the principle to match MRI protocol to a specific clinical question rather than using contrast by default [^111KVFbj] [^116KJEpe]. Let me reconsider: unless I can articulate a contrast-requiring differential like infection, neoplasm, inflammatory synovitis characterization, or postoperative problem-solving, the incremental utility of gadolinium here remains unproven for the typical traumatic indications [^115gfjP5].

> But wait, what if the clinical concern is actually beyond standard internal derangement, such as occult infection or tumor masquerading as trauma? I should confirm that in such atypical scenarios, contrast can be justified to evaluate synovial enhancement, abscess, or soft-tissue characterization, which is outside the routine pathway for a straightforward ligamentous or meniscal injury in a 28-year-old after a twist or fall [^notfound]. If the presentation or labs raise those red flags, the protocol can be tailored accordingly; otherwise, non-contrast MRI remains the correct default for traumatic derangements [^112X1PFP] [^115a728T].

> Synthesis: For a 28-year-old woman with an acute knee injury and suspected internal derangement after appropriate radiographs, the standard of care is a non-contrast knee MRI, which has high diagnostic accuracy for ACL and meniscal injuries and has supplanted diagnostic arthroscopy in many settings; gadolinium is not routinely required and should be reserved for specific indications such as suspected infection, tumor, inflammatory synovitis assessment, postoperative cartilage repair evaluation, or a vascular study pathway in severe trauma scenarios, none of which are implied by a typical acute injury presentation [^115ijErj] [^113GDJYo] [^112X1PFP] [^115a728T] [^116dvB9a]. I should double-check that this aligns with guideline phrasing: ACR and AAOS recommendations support MRI for internal derangement without mandating contrast, and practice recommendations outline a basic non-contrast protocol as standard for acute knee trauma, confirming that ordering "with and without contrast" would be inappropriate unless a specific contrast-dependent question exists [^112X1PFP] [^114Yt4JW] [^1169T2kQ] [^1162rmm9] [^11436asj].

> Bottom line: No, for a 28-year-old woman with a typical traumatic knee injury, a non-contrast knee MRI is sufficient; gadolinium-enhanced sequences are unnecessary unless there is a targeted clinical indication such as inflammatory arthritis, infection, postoperative cartilage evaluation, tumor work-up, or a vascular injury pathway in severe trauma, and routine "with-and-without contrast" imaging is not recommended by major guidelines for this scenario [^115a728T] [^112X1PFP] [^115ijErj] [^116dvB9a].

MRI with contrast is **not routinely recommended** for knee injuries in a 28-year-old female. Non-contrast MRI is **standard** for most ligament, meniscal, and cartilage injuries due to its high diagnostic accuracy and lower risk profile [^113GDJYo] [^115a728T]. Contrast is reserved for suspected **infection**, **tumor** [^112ZYzcE], or **postoperative complications** [^114YUE25] when additional detail is needed [^112X1PFP]. Routine contrast use increases cost, time, and risk without improving diagnostic yield in typical knee injuries.

## Diagnostic accuracy of MRI without contrast

MRI without contrast is **highly accurate** [^113GDJYo] for common knee injuries; these metrics support non-contrast MRI as the **preferred initial imaging** for acute meniscal tears [^115a728T] and internal derangement [^112X1PFP]:

- **ACL tears**: Sensitivity 87%, specificity 93% [^115ijErj].
- **Medial meniscal tears**: Sensitivity 89%, specificity 88% [^115ijErj].
- **Lateral meniscal tears**: Sensitivity 78%, specificity 95% [^115ijErj].

## Indications for MRI with contrast

Contrast-enhanced MRI is **reserved for specific scenarios**; routine contrast use in typical knee injuries is **not supported by current guidelines**:

- **Suspected infection or tumor**: When enhanced tissue characterization is needed [^112ZYzcE].
- **Postoperative evaluation**: To assess complications such as synovitis or graft issues [^114YUE25].
- **Complex cases**: When non-contrast MRI is inconclusive and further detail is required.

---

## Risks and disadvantages of contrast-enhanced MRI

Contrast-enhanced MRI carries **additional risks and disadvantages**:

- **Allergic reactions**: Rare but possible with gadolinium-based agents.
- **Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis**: Rare in patients with severe renal impairment.
- **Increased cost and time**: Additional resources and patient time required.
- **Patient discomfort**: Intravenous injection may cause anxiety or discomfort.

### Editorial commentary: Is magnetic resonance imaging imaged knee patellar tracking relevant in assessing the patient with patellar instability [^113RwKmo]. Arthroscopy (2018). Low credibility.

Patellar pain and instability are common presentations to surgeons; however, assessment remains more of a static art than a dynamic science. In addition to resource-intensive gait laboratory tests, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have been used to measure patellar tracking. CT has the limitation of radiation, while MRI is constrained by software processing times. With an updated MRI protocol and software, it is now possible to dynamically view patellar tracking. The next goal will be determining how this capability can be used to aid in the diagnosis and treatment of patients.

### The clinical utility and diagnostic performance of magnetic resonance imaging for identification of early and advanced knee osteoarthritis: a systematic review [^111DWDk5]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Diagnostic strategies for detection of structural articular cartilage abnormalities, the earliest structural signs of osteoarthritis, often do not capture the condition until it is too far advanced for the most potential benefit of noninvasive interventions.

- **Purpose**: To systematically review the literature relative to the following questions: (1) Is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) a valid, sensitive, specific, accurate, and reliable instrument to identify knee articular cartilage abnormalities compared with arthroscopy? (2) Is MRI a sensitive tool that can be utilized to identify early cartilage degeneration?

- **Study design**: Systematic review.

- **Methods**: A systematic search was performed in November 2010 using the PubMed MEDLINE (from 1966), CINAHL (from 1982), SPORTDiscus (from 1985), SCOPUS (from 1996), and EMBASE (from 1974) databases.

- **Results**: Fourteen level I and 13 level II studies were identified that met inclusion criteria and provided information related to diagnostic performance of MRI compared with arthroscopic evaluation. The diagnostic performance of MRI demonstrated a large range of sensitivities, specificities, and accuracies. The sensitivity for identifying articular cartilage abnormalities in the knee joint was reported between 26% and 96%. Specificity and accuracy were reported between 50% and 100% and between 49% and 94%, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for identifying early osteoarthritis were reported between 0% and 86%, 48% and 95%, and 5% and 94%, respectively. As a result of inconsistencies between imaging te

### Forensic age assessment of the knee: Proposal of a new classification system using two-dimensional ultrasound volumes and comparison to MRI [^114tVGpY]. European Radiology (2021). Low credibility.

This prospective study was approved by the institutional review board, and written informed consent was obtained from all participants. To methodically test MRI and ultrasound (US) of the knee for age determination, a homogeneous study population was defined and limited to healthy male individuals between 14 and 19 years of age. At our institution, forensic age assessment is mainly requested for male subjects. All participants lived near Hamburg, Germany, had a middle-high socioeconomic status, and were recruited from staff. A total of 40 male individuals (mean age 16.7 ± 1.6 years) were examined between April and June 2015 for epiphyseal closure of the right knee.

Exclusion criteria included the presence of fractures around the right knee, a chronic disease that potentially affected bone growth, and incomplete documentation. Of the 40 scheduled cases, 4 MRI examinations were canceled on the day of the examination due to non-MRI-compatible implants. In 4 cases, documentation of the US examination was incomplete. In total, 33 cases with full MRI and US data sets were included in this study (mean age 15.5 years, range 14.4–19.3 years).

The chronological age for each subject and time point was calculated as the difference between the date of birth and the imaging acquisition date. Following the conservative estimate used for forensic age assessment, the chronological age was rounded to full years; for example, 17.8 years was rounded to 17 years. The data sets were made anonymous.

### Using magnetic resonance imaging to determine the compartmental prevalence of knee joint structural damage [^116LswGw]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2013). Low credibility.

To describe the prevalence of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) detected structural damage in the patellofemoral joint (PFJ) and tibiofemoral joint (TFJ) in a population-based cohort, the secondary aim was to evaluate the patterns of compartmental involvement in knees with pain, between men and women, and in different age and body mass index (BMI) categories.

We studied 970 knees, one knee per subject, from the Framingham Osteoarthritis Study, a population-based cohort study of persons 51–92 years old. Cartilage damage and bone marrow lesions (BMLs) were assessed using the Whole Organ Magnetic Resonance Imaging Score (WORMS). The prevalence of isolated PFJ, isolated TFJ, and mixed structural damage was determined using the following definitions: any cartilage damage, full thickness cartilage loss, any BML, and the combination of full thickness cartilage loss with any BML.

The mean age and BMI was 63.4 years and 28.6 m/kg², respectively; 57% were female. Isolated PFJ damage occurred in 15–20% of knees and isolated TFJ damage occurred in 8–17% of knees depending on the definition used. The prevalence of isolated PFJ damage was greater than isolated TFJ damage using all definitions except the any BML definition. This pattern was similar between genders and among age and BMI categories. In those with knee pain, isolated PFJ was at least as common as TFJ damage depending on the definition used.

Using MRI to assess knee joint structural damage, isolated PFJ damage was at least as common as, if not more common than, isolated TFJ damage.

### Lower extremity MRI: Are their requests always appropriate in France [^115R5wj1]. European Radiology (2025). Low credibility.

Apart from the 2012 CNAM study, we have not found any other study about the relevance of lower extremity MRI or knee MRI in France. A survey carried out in 2020 by the Académie Nationale de Médecine among 260 patients seen consecutively on the same day at an osteoarticular imaging center showed that 70% of MRI requests were incomplete, with the reason for the request specified for only 14% of patients. The authors underline the importance of integrating the obligation to provide sufficient clinical information into e-prescription software.

Internationally, a recent systematic review of the literature concerning the appropriateness of diagnostic imaging found that for MRI of extremities, the overall appropriateness rate was 66% (n = 352/535). It is worth noting that the four underlying studies varied in sample size (55–300) and results (55–83%). One of the studies focused on the knee; based on the availability of an electronic medical record (EMR) for every MRI performed in the Elche Health Department in Spain, the authors found that in 45% of cases (N = 135/300) the MRI prescription was inappropriate. The main situations of inappropriateness included the use of MRI as the initial imaging technique.

The inappropriateness of knee MRI has also been studied in other countries and has shown that practices could be improved. In the United States, George et al. found that 22.8% of MRI examinations for non-traumatic knee pain performed in 2010 among Medicare and private insurance patients had been performed without prior radiography in the same calendar year. In a study conducted in Atlant…

### Imaging following acute knee trauma [^113iYoMK]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2014). Low credibility.

Joint injury has been recognized as a potent risk factor for the onset of osteoarthritis. The vast majority of studies using imaging technology for longitudinal assessment of patients following joint injury have focused on the injured knee joint, specifically in patients with anterior cruciate ligament injury and meniscus tears where a high risk for rapid onset of post-traumatic osteoarthritis is well known. Although there are many imaging modalities under constant development, magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is the most important instrument for longitudinal monitoring after joint injury. MR imaging is sensitive for detecting early cartilage degeneration and can evaluate other joint structures, including the menisci, bone marrow, tendons, and ligaments, which can be sources of pain following acute injury.

In this review focusing on imaging following acute knee trauma, several studies were identified with promising short-term results of osseous and soft tissue changes after joint injury. However, studies connecting these promising short-term results to the development of osteoarthritis were limited, which is likely due to the long follow-up periods needed to document the radiographic and clinical onset of the disease. Thus, it is recommended that additional high-quality longitudinal studies with extended follow-up periods be performed to further investigate the long-term consequences of the early osseous and soft tissue changes identified on MR imaging after acute knee trauma.

### Diagnosis of chondral lesions of the knee joint: Can MRI replace arthroscopy? A prospective study [^1176yUwn]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2004). Low credibility.

The role of magnetic resonance tomography (MRI) for the diagnosis of chondral lesions of the knee joint is still unclear. The sensitivity of the method ranges from 15% to 96%. Our daily experiences showed considerable deviations between tomographical and arthroscopical results, which vary from experimental studies. Therefore we have conducted a prospective study to investigate how MRI can replace arthroscopy (ASC) in diagnosing cartilage damage in daily routine.

All 195 patients included in this study underwent magnetic resonance tomography followed by an arthroscopy. A clear diagnosis of supposition had to be determined before the magnetic resonance tomography. The patients were divided into three groups.

- **Group A (n = 86)**: Received a standard Military Hospital Ulm (MH) MRI — sagittal STIR TSE and PD TSE, coronal and transversal T2 FFE (TR = 660 ms, TE = 18 ms, FA = 30 degrees, 512 matrix). In addition, one subgroup, AK (n = 21), was examined with a special cartilage sequence of the cartilage fs T1 W FFE. Neither patients in Group AK nor in Group A as a whole received any contrast medium.

- **Group B (n = 88)**: Examined with an alternate MRI protocol (Radiological Joint Practice, Neu-Ulm — sagittal T1 SE, T2 SE and T2 FLASH (TR = 608 ms, TE = 18 ms, FA = 20 degrees, 256 matrix), coronal PD fs), employing gadolinium as a contrast medium.

A total of 156 cartilage lesions were found arthroscopically. In Group A, the sensitivity was 33%, specificity 99%, and positive and negative predictive values were 75% and 98%, respectively.

### Reporting knee meniscal tears: Technical aspects, typical pitfalls and how to avoid them [^112hSsj2]. Insights into Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

The routinely used MRI sequences are two-dimensional (2D), fast spin-echo (FSE) sequences, including proton-density (PD)-weighted, T1-weighted sequences, and T2- and T1-weighted sequences with and without fat suppression. When comparing with spin-echo (SE) sequences, FSE sequences facilitate examination in a shorter overall time without statistically significant differences in meniscal tear detection rates. By using high-magnetic field strength with dedicated coils, and parallel imaging techniques, the scan time may be decreased even more. Some particular types of meniscal tears have been proven to be better evaluated on specific sequences; for example, coronal T2-weighted images showed a 96% diagnostic accuracy compared with an 85% accuracy of PD-weighted coronal images for the diagnosis of medial meniscal root tears.

Most authors still prefer standard two-dimensional over three-dimensional fast spin-echo sequences and over gradient-echo sequences because the former provide classic, well-known T1-, T2-, and intermediate-weighted contrast information, enabling detection of subtle abnormalities of the meniscus and ligaments. This is in contradiction to the fact that with three-dimensional (3D) gradient-echo (GRE) and 3D fast spin-echo FSE sequences, thinner sections with decreased partial volume averaging and isotropic voxel imaging with multiplanar reformations (that potentially reduce the examination time) are possible. Indeed, several studies have shown that 3D isotropic FSE sequences can provide rapid knee joint evaluation. By using 3D fat-saturated PD FSE sequences, a high level of detail in the knee joint may be achieved.

The knee is the joint most commonly imaged by MRI in children. With increasing participation in competitive sports at younger ages, knee injuries have become common. While older adolescents exhibit patterns of injury similar to those seen in adults, injuries in skeletally immature patients differ. This essay highlights the MR findings of injuries specific to the skeletally immature knee.

### ESR essentials: Mri of the knee-practice recommendations by ESSR [^11436asj]. European Radiology (2024). Low credibility.

Fluid-sensitive sequences can vary considerably, and the choice of weighting must be adjusted according to the scanner and the local preference of the reporting radiologist. In acute knee trauma, an MRI should always be accompanied by a radiograph (or computed tomography) of the knee to avoid missing small bony avulsions. If bone marrow pathology is detected first on MRI, radiographs or CT may be performed to supplement the MRI if the diagnosis is uncertain. This should not be misinterpreted as "radiographs are unnecessary", or that MRI of the knee should be the first modality regardless of clinical indication. Level of evidence of recommendation: 4/Low.

- **Clinical indications for knee MRI**: The optimal use of MRI is best decided in conjunction with key local stakeholders, but some overarching principles exist. MRI of the knee is indicated in acute knee trauma with suspected internal derangement and in the course of post-traumatic assessment. It is also indicated in clinically unexplained chronic knee pain when prior radiographs are non-diagnostic. Some imaging centers vary their knee MRI protocols according to the clinical query. However, even though clinical history improves MRI diagnostics, important incidental or concomitant findings may be missed if all structures are not routinely evaluated.

- **Basic image assessment**: The assessment should include evaluation of the menisci (including roots), ligamentous structures and tendons, cartilage, bone and bone marrow, soft tissues, bursae, and femorotibial and patellar alignment, as well as any incidental findings.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® acute trauma to the knee [^1169T2kQ]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2020). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for meniscal tears, more specifically with respect to diagnostic imaging, ACR 2020 guidelines recommend considering obtaining knee radiography as initial imaging for the evaluation of a fall or acute twisting trauma to the knee in patients aged ≥ 5 years without focal tenderness, effusion, or inability to walk.

### The use of MRI in evaluating knee pain in patients aged 40 years and older [^1141D3Dd]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2016). Low credibility.

Use of MRI is increasing when evaluating patients with knee pain because it is highly sensitive for detecting intra-articular pathology. However, such changes can be associated with degenerative joint disease, which may be demonstrated with weight-bearing radiographs. The purpose of this study was to determine how often MRI was obtained before orthopedic referral in patients aged ≥ 40 years with knee pain, how often weight-bearing radiographs were obtained before MRI, and whether such imaging influenced treatment recommendations.

- **Methods**: In a study of 599 new patients, participating physicians documented the presence of a prereferral MRI and/or plain radiographic studies, the results of weight-bearing radiographs, treatment recommendations, and the impact of any prereferral imaging.

- **Results**: Prereferral use of MRI occurred in 130 patients (22%). Of these patients, plain radiographic studies were obtained for 58% before MRI, and 13% had weight-bearing radiographs. Ultimately, 17% had weight-bearing radiographs that demonstrated > 50% loss of joint space. Forty-eight percent of prereferral MRIs did not contribute to treatment recommendations. In patients with > 50% loss of joint space, MRI was considered unnecessary in 95% of the cases.

- **Discussion**: Many prereferral MRIs do not contribute to clinical decision making. Weight-bearing radiographs can help identify those patients in whom MRI is unlikely to be helpful.

- **Level of evidence**: Level III.

### Prevalence of knee osteoarthritis features on magnetic resonance imaging in asymptomatic uninjured adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113w3fLA]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2019). High credibility.

In this systematic review, summary estimates of the prevalence of MRI features suggestive of osteoarthritis among otherwise healthy asymptomatic uninjured knees ranged from 4% to 14% in young adults, and from 19% to 43% in older adults aged ≥ 40 years. These imaging findings must be interpreted in the context of clinical presentations and considered in clinical decision-making.

- **What is already known on this subject**: Increasing availability of MRI has resulted in a rapid rise in its utilization to help inform clinical management of patients with knee symptoms, yet the overall clinical benefit of the use of knee MRI is uncertain. Community-based studies have reported a high prevalence of knee osteoarthritis features detected by MRI, but these cohorts include people with knee pain and a history of knee injury, a well-established risk factor for the accelerated development of knee osteoarthritis.

- **What are the new findings**: The prevalence of knee osteoarthritis features on MRI in otherwise healthy, asymptomatic, uninjured knees is high — up to 43% in adults aged ≥ 40 years. Prevalence rates generally increase with age and are influenced by other factors such as physical activity levels and the type of MRI sequences used.

Measurement properties for clinical examination and MRI

No single question, test, or image can accurately identify an ACL injury every time. The measurement tools available to the clinician are not perfect, but they yield valuable information in the clinical context. Knowledge of the measurement properties of clinical tools helps the clinician balance the information gained from these tools. The negative predictive values of clinical examination and MRI for ACL tear and meniscal pathology are higher than the positive predictive values. This means that if the clinical examination or MRI are negative for injury, the chance of the patient having an injury is low. However, if the tests are positive, it does not mean that the clinician can always reliably rule the diagnosis in.

- **Diagnostic accuracy of clinical examination and MRI in intraarticular knee disorders**: Clinical examination included patient history, physical examination, and X-rays performed by a paediatric orthopaedic sports medicine specialist or a post-residency paediatric sports medicine fellow.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for osteochondritis dissecans, specifically concerning knee MRI, the AAOS 2023 guidelines recommend considering knee MRI to characterize the osteochondritis dissecans lesion in patients with a known lesion on X-ray. Knee MRI is also advised when concomitant knee pathology is suspected, such as meniscal pathology, ACL injury, or articular cartilage injury.

### Association between knee magnetic resonance imaging markers and knee symptoms over 6–9 years in young adults [^116JpFFR]. Rheumatology (2024). Low credibility.

To our knowledge, this is the first study reporting the association of MRI markers with knee symptoms in a general population-based cohort of young to middle-aged adults. Our results indicate that knee MRI-assessed semiquantitative markers such as bone marrow lesions (BMLs) and cartilage defects are positively associated with knee symptoms both cross-sectionally and longitudinally over 6–9 years. Morphological markers, such as total cartilage volume (particularly patellar), are weakly and negatively associated with knee symptoms in longitudinal and cross-sectional analyses. Similarly, the total bone area was negatively associated with knee symptoms in both analyses. Thus, our results suggest that semiquantitative and quantitative measures from knee MRI can potentially be used as markers of early knee osteoarthritis (OA) in young adults.

Understanding the association between early knee joint structural changes and knee symptoms is of utmost importance in defining early OA. Although radiography is considered the gold standard for diagnosing knee OA, the concept of early knee OA has dramatically evolved with new imaging techniques such as MRI. MRI enables early detection of cartilage defects, changes in cartilage volume and thickness, BMLs, synovitis, and meniscal tears.

Several studies investigating the association of BMLs with knee symptoms in patients with knee OA have reported a significant positive association. Consistent with our previous study, we found a significant association between BMLs and knee symptoms and a trend toward a dose-response relationship between BMLs and knee pain.

In this study, findings from 57 healthy children (77.2% female) with a mean age of 13.6 years (SD 3.1, range 6.7–17.8 years) were analyzed. Of the included children, 31 out of 57 (54.4%) had transient knee complaints without a known cause, 8 out of 58 (14.0%) had joint complaints associated with hypermobility syndrome, and 18 out of 58 (31.6%) had complaints attributed to a functional disorder or chronic pain syndrome.

No significant differences in descriptive statistics, clinical findings, or laboratory findings were found among the three subgroups of children included. An overview of the clinical characteristics of the included patients is depicted in Table 1.

- **MRI findings**: Of the included children, 40 (70.2%) were scanned using the 1.0-T magnet, and 17 (29.8%) were scanned using the 3.0-T magnet. No significant differences in MRI findings were found between the two systems. Moreover, no significant differences in MRI findings were detected among the three different subgroups of children included.

### New-generation 0.55 T MRI of the knee-initial clinical experience and comparison with 3 T MRI [^112Xa94M]. Investigative Radiology (2024). Low credibility.

Internal derangement of the knee is one of the most common indications for MRI of the musculoskeletal system, and the knee is consequently a commonly imaged joint. Magnetic resonance imaging is considered the imaging standard due to its superior soft tissue contrast compared to other imaging modalities. Although both 1.5 T and 3 T MRI can provide diagnostic images, 3 T MRI is generally preferred at most institutions because it provides higher image resolution. This is consistent with a contemporary meta-analysis suggesting benefits of 3 T over 1.5 T knee MRI.

Moreover, increasing literature is published regarding the potential of ultra-high field 7 T MRI of the knee, possibly offering superior assessment of joint cartilage. Perhaps contradicting this trend towards greater field strength knee MRI for more detailed analyses, we hypothesized that new-generation low-field MRI allows for diagnostic knee examinations in clinical practice and is able to address common referrer queries. These include the identification of trauma sequelae of the ligaments, tendons, menisci, bone, and joint cartilage. Thus, the purpose of our study was to compare the detection rate and reader confidence in new-generation 0.55 T knee MRI findings with those of 3 T knee MRI in patients with knee pain following acute trauma.

### Spectrum of injuries associated with paediatric ACL tears: An MRI pictorial review [^115Crcxe]. Insights into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury are well known, but most published reviews show obvious examples of associated injuries and give little focus to paediatric patients. Here, we demonstrate the spectrum of MRI appearances at common sites of associated injury in adolescents with ACL tears, emphasizing age-specific issues.

- **Methods**: Pictorial review using images from children with surgically confirmed ACL tears after athletic injury.

- **Results**: ACL injury usually occurs with axial rotation in the valgus near full extension. The MRI findings can be obvious and important to management (ACL rupture), subtle but clinically important (lateral meniscus posterior attachment avulsion), obvious and unimportant to management (femoral condyle impaction injury), or subtle and possibly important (medial meniscocapsular junction tear). Paediatric-specific issues of note include tibial spine avulsion, normal difficulty visualizing a thin ACL and posterolateral corner structures, and differentiation between incompletely closed physis and impaction fracture.

- **Conclusion**: ACL tear is only the most obvious sign of a complex injury involving multiple structures. Awareness of the spectrum of secondary findings illustrated here and the features distinguishing them from normal variation can aid in accurate assessment of ACL tears and related injuries, enabling effective treatment planning and assessment of prognosis.

- **Teaching points**: The ACL in children normally appears thin or attenuated, while thickening and oedema suggest tear.

### Magnetic resonance imaging of the knee for chronological age estimation-a systematic review [^113W1VFc]. European Radiology (2023). Low credibility.

To calculate positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), sensitivity, and specificity, the frequency/ratio of mature and immature knees per age, as well as the age distribution of the population tested, needs to be known. The risk of misclassification depends on the actual age distribution of those tested. For example, if many individuals are tested in the age range of 17 to 18 years, the risk of misclassification will be high. If the age range is widened, the proportion of errors will be lower.

- **Illustrating the issue**: We have performed calculations on five hypothetical populations, each with a different age distribution.

Using data from the study by Ottow et al. (male), we illustrate how the same data points give rise to different predictive values in response to variation in the age distribution of the population tested. This is further elaborated in Supplement 6, where predictive values using data points from other included studies on the same five hypothetical populations are presented. The calculations show that NPV, PPV, sensitivity, and specificity for MRI of the knee as a test to determine whether a person is over or under 18 years old cannot be calculated in individuals between 15 and 21 years of age unless the exact age composition of the group is known.

### Incidental meniscal findings on knee MRI in middle-aged and elderly persons [^111TxiWS]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the knee is often performed in patients with knee symptoms of unclear cause. When meniscal tears are found, it is commonly assumed that the symptoms are attributable to them. However, there is a paucity of data regarding the prevalence of meniscal damage in the general population and the association of meniscal tears with knee symptoms and with radiographic evidence of osteoarthritis.

- **Methods**: We studied individuals from Framingham, Massachusetts, who were drawn from census-tract data and random-digit telephone dialing. Subjects ranged from 50 to 90 years of age and were ambulatory; selection was not based on the presence of knee or other joint problems. We assessed the integrity of the menisci in the right knee using 1.5-tesla MRI scans obtained from 991 subjects, 57% of whom were women. Symptoms involving the right knee were evaluated by questionnaire.

- **Results**: The prevalence of a meniscal tear or meniscal destruction in the right knee, as detected on MRI, ranged from 19% (95% confidence interval, 15 to 24) among women aged 50 to 59 years to 56% (95% CI, 46 to 66) among men aged 70 to 90 years. The prevalences were not materially lower when excluding subjects who had undergone previous knee surgery. Among persons with radiographic evidence of osteoarthritis (Kellgren-Lawrence grade 2 or higher, on a scale of 0 to 4, with higher numbers indicating more definite signs of osteoarthritis), the prevalence of a meniscal tear was 63% among those with knee pain, aching, or stiffness on most days, and 60% among those without these symptoms.

### How to optimize the use of MRI in anatomic ACL reconstruction [^112uunE2]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2013). Low credibility.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most diagnostic imaging procedure for suspected ACL injuries. It is an accurate, highly sensitive, and specific tool for diagnosing ACL tears, graft tears, and associated injuries. However, it can also be used for various other aspects of anatomic ACL reconstruction.

- **Methods**: Special sequences, such as the oblique sagittal plane, should be obtained from a parallel line to the lateral epicondyle, ensuring proper visualization of both bundles of the ACL. Another special set of images, the oblique-coronal sequence, allows for the ACL long-axis evaluation. The coronal-oblique sequence increases the sensitivity and specificity of diagnosing isolated AM or PL bundle injuries and also helps to visualize the proximal insertion of the bundles for hemorrhage and rupture.

- **Results**: Quantitative measurements can be taken from a proper MRI protocol to determine the rupture pattern, measure insertion site size, inclination angle, and autograft size, and evaluate post-operative complications. These parameters help surgeons objectively decide on a better graft and technique for an individualized approach and to evaluate the anatomic placement of the graft.

- **Conclusions**: MRI can be used in different ways, serving as a very valuable tool in anatomic ACL reconstruction. Special protocols can provide accurate visualization of the double-bundle anatomy. Objective parameters to aid in pre-operative decisions and graft's anatomic placement evaluation can also be extracted from the MR images.

### Predictive factors for new onset or progression of knee osteoarthritis one year after trauma: MRI follow-up in general practice [^117JGkuu]. European Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

Magnetic resonance imaging was performed within 3 to 6 weeks of trauma and repeated after approximately 1 year of follow-up. For both examinations, the same technique and pulse sequences were applied using a 1.0 Tesla whole-body MRI unit and a dedicated knee coil. The imaging protocol consisted of sagittal T1-, T2-, and proton density-weighted fast spin-echo sequences, coronal T2✱-weighted gradient echo and fat-suppressed T2-weighted fast spin-echo sequences, and an axial proton density-weighted fast spin-echo sequence.

The initial and follow-up MRI examinations were evaluated for the presence of degenerative abnormalities of the femorotibial joint using the Knee Osteoarthritis Scoring System (KOSS). To grade the severity of osteoarthritis, the Kellgren and Lawrence scoring system, which was originally developed for grading osteoarthritic changes on conventional radiography, was used.

- **Documentation**: Findings, including degenerative abnormalities like meniscal lesions and bone marrow oedema, along with ligamentous lesions observed on the initial MRI, were documented on a standardized report form.

The Kellgren and Lawrence score is detailed as follows:

- **Grade 0**: No degenerative abnormalities
- **Grade 1**: Minimal osteophyte of unknown significance
- **Grade 2**: Osteophytes without joint space narrowing
- **Grade 3**: Moderate joint space narrowing
- **Grade 4**: Severe joint space narrowing with sclerosis of subchondral bone

This cross-tabulation of femorotibial Kellgren and Lawrence scores compares initial versus follow-up MRI examinations and presents the number of patients in each category.

### A systematic approach to magnetic resonance imaging interpretation of sports medicine injuries of the knee [^113sj2AW]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Magnetic resonance imaging is performed more commonly on the knee than on any other joint, and it serves as an excellent diagnostic tool that can aid in evaluating a host of sports-related injuries involving the ligaments, tendons, menisci, osseous structures, and articular surfaces. A thorough evaluation of the images can be a daunting task, as the study often contains dozens of images obtained with multiple pulse sequences and in several imaging planes. A systematic approach will facilitate an accurate and timely evaluation of this complex examination and will ensure that all of the clinically relevant structures are adequately assessed.

This article provides a systematic approach to interpreting a magnetic resonance examination of the knee. The normal imaging appearance of each anatomical structure is described, and the optimal pulse sequence and imaging plane for the evaluation of each structure are discussed. Finally, signs of injury are described and illustrated.

### The accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging scanning and its influence on management decisions in knee surgery [^1171uTxo]. Arthroscopy (2009). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) assessment on articular knee pathology for the clinical management of patients presenting with joint line pain.

- **Methods**: A preliminary study was conducted on 100 patients to assess the accuracy of specific MRI sequences, using arthroscopy as a gold standard. Following this, 618 consecutive patients with knee symptoms presenting to two specialist knee surgeons were recruited. A clinical diagnosis of an arthroscopically treatable lesion was made in all cases. Clinical assessment data were correlated with subsequent MRI findings, recording any discrepancies and whether MRI findings influenced management decisions.

- **Results**: In the preliminary study, MRI sequences demonstrated an overall sensitivity of 83.2% and a specificity of 94.3% for detecting chondral lesions. Sensitivity and specificity improved to 84.5% and 97.1% respectively for arthroscopic grade III and IV lesions. In the second phase, 141 (22.8%) of the 618 patients had altered clinical management following MRI results. Unexpected chondral lesions were found in 77 of these patients, while 22 patients with symptoms indicative of simple chondral degeneration had unstable meniscal tears.

- **Conclusions**: Preoperative MRI scanning may identify a subset of patients with more advanced degenerative joint disease than suggested by clinical assessments and plain radiographs.

### 7 T musculoskeletal MRI: Fundamentals and clinical implementation [^113GDJYo]. Investigative Radiology (2023). High credibility.

The joint most commonly evaluated with MRI is the knee; noncontrast 1.5 T and 3 T MRI have replaced diagnostic knee arthroscopy, which was still performed in large numbers at the beginning of this century in patients with unclear symptoms. Magnetic resonance images acquired at 1.5 T or 3 T allow the radiologist to visualize internal derangements of the knee in a similar way as is possible during open surgery or even autopsy.

Ex vivo histological studies and magnified views from arthroscopy allowed us to learn about the microanatomical structure of the menisci and the articular cartilage. However, clinical MRI techniques fail to provide an equally reliable depiction of the musculoskeletal anatomy in vivo at the same resolution.

Computed tomography and MR arthrography have been useful for a more accurate assessment of some internal derangements of the joints; however, they are invasive through the need for a direct injection of contrast agent into the joint under fluoroscopic or ultrasound guidance. With state-of-the-art 7 T MRI, it is possible to substantially increase spatial resolution, which helps detect small meniscal tears and delamination of the articular cartilage even in noncontrast studies.

Dual-echo steady-state imaging at 7 T visualizes the meniscal and chondral calcifications in patients with calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease much better than at lower field strength and even more accurately than computed tomography.

With ultra-high-field MRI, we can not only depict classic meniscal tears but also better assess other intricate anatomical details.

### ESR essentials: MRI of the knee-practice recommendations by ESSR [^113R5ZKp]. European Radiology (2024). Low credibility.

The four main stabilizing ligaments of the knee are the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), posterior cruciate ligament (PCL), medial collateral ligament (MCL), and lateral collateral ligament (LCL). They provide stability to the knee during flexion-extension, valgus-varus movement, and internal and external rotation. Additional capsular structures and muscle tendons, particularly in the posteromedial and posterolateral corners, contribute to knee stability. Anterolateral capsular structures are important secondary rotational stabilizers in the knee.

All ligaments normally appear as dark signal structures on T1-, T2-, and PD-weighted images. The cruciate ligaments are composed of two bundles that can be appreciated in all planes, with the ACL appearing more striated than the PCL. This should not be misinterpreted as a partial thickness rupture of the ACL. Ligament pathology is indicated by increased signal, thickening or thinning of the ligaments, or discontinuity of fibers. Bony avulsions at either the proximal or distal attachments of both the cruciate and collateral ligaments may occur and should not be missed.

An associated avulsion is the Segond fracture, which is a small avulsion of the anterolateral tibial rim where the iliotibial band and anterolateral capsule attach. This fracture is associated with an ACL rupture in adult patients. The arcuate complex involves the conjoined LCL and biceps femoris tendon attachment avulsing the proximal fibular head, and this finding is associated with an ACL rupture.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® acute trauma to the knee [^111fQ6YC]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2020). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for patellofemoral pain syndrome, particularly in relation to diagnostic imaging for acute knee pain, the ACR 2020 guidelines recommend obtaining a knee MRI or CT scan. This is specifically for evaluating suspected additional bone or soft tissue injury following a fall or acute twisting trauma to the knee in patients aged 5 years and older who have a radiographic diagnosis of a tibial plateau fracture.

### Physician provider type influences utilization and diagnostic utility of magnetic resonance imaging of the knee [^114mYbfn]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. American Volume (2015). Low credibility.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the knee is expensive and is neither needed nor useful for all patients presenting with knee pain. Our objective was to determine the completeness of evaluation prior to ordering MRI of the knee, correlated to the ordering providers' postgraduate medical training, and the rate of positive findings on the subsequent MRI.

- **Methods**: Six hundred consecutive knee MRIs were reviewed, including 200 consecutive MRI examinations from each of three provider types: orthopedic surgeons, non-surgical physicians with sports medicine training, and primary care providers. Positive findings on MRI were recorded, as well as a history of present illness, a physical examination, and radiographs made prior to ordering MRI of the knee. Patient and injury factors were recorded. Differences in patient factors, evaluation before MRI, and positive findings were examined. A modified Poisson regression approach was used to determine predictors of a proper evaluation before MRI and positive findings on knee MRI.

- **Results**: Orthopedic surgeons and non-surgical sports physicians were significantly more likely to document a physical examination, evaluate radiographs made prior to ordering an MRI, and identify positive findings on the MRI (all p < 0.001). In multivariate models, orthopedic surgeons were more likely to document these findings.

### Magnetic resonance imaging of the multiple-ligament injured knee [^113NbbdT]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2002). Low credibility.

To evaluate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) in detecting soft tissue, neurovascular, and bony injury after multiple ligament knee injury, including knee dislocation, a retrospective search was performed. This involved patients presenting with reported knee dislocation from May 1993 through May 2000 who underwent both MRI and surgical reconstruction. Twenty-one patients met these criteria (15 men and six women; age range 14 to 75 years; mean 32.6 years). Magnetic resonance diagnoses of soft tissue and bony injury were compared with the patients' operative findings. MRA of the popliteal vessels was performed in seventeen of the twenty-one patients, and the results of these studies are described.

Multiple ligamentous, tendinous, meniscal, chondral, osseous, and neural injuries were seen. There was excellent correlation (kappa > 0.8) between the magnetic resonance and operative findings regarding the size and location of tears. Regarding meniscal tears, the type (e.g. bucket, radial split, meniscocapsular separation) and location correlated well with surgery. All ten nerve injuries noted on magnetic resonance were confirmed at surgery. Six of the patients had both conventional angiograms and MRAs with 100 percent agreement between the studies. In one patient, an intimal flap in the popliteal artery was seen on MRA and confirmed on conventional angiographic images.

In conclusion, MRI is an accurate method of assessing soft tissue, osseous, and neural damage after knee dislocation.

### Does MRI add value in general practice for patients with traumatic knee complaints? A 1-year randomised controlled trial [^116MDNE2]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2019). High credibility.

To determine whether referral to MRI by the general practitioner (GP) is non-inferior to usual care (no access to MRI by GPs) in patients with traumatic knee complaints regarding knee-related daily function, this multicentre, non-inferiority randomised controlled trial with 1-year follow-up was conducted. GPs invited eligible patients during or after their consultation. Eligible patients (18–45 years) consulted a GP with knee complaints due to a trauma during the previous 6 months. Patients allocated to the MRI group received an MRI at a median of 7 (IQR 1–33) days after the baseline questionnaire. Patients in the usual care group received information on the course of knee complaints and a referral to a physiotherapist or orthopaedic surgeon when indicated. The primary outcome measure was knee-related daily function measured with the Lysholm scale (0 to 100; 100 = excellent function) over 1 year, with a non-inferiority margin of 6 points.

A total of 356 patients were included and randomised to MRI (n = 179) or usual care (n = 177) from November 2012 to December 2015. MRI was non-inferior to usual care concerning knee-related daily function during the 1-year follow-up for the intention-to-treat (overall adjusted estimate: 0.33; 95% CI -1.73 to 2.39) and per-protocol (overall adjusted estimate: 0.06; 95% CI -2.08 to 2.19) analysis. There were no differences between both groups in the number of patients visiting other healthcare providers.

MRI in general practice in patients with traumatic knee complaints was non-inferior to usual care regarding knee-related daily function over 1 year.

### 2018 International Olympic Committee consensus statement on prevention, diagnosis and management of paediatric anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries [^116RNfXs]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

No isolated question, test, or image can accurately identify an ACL injury every time. The measurement tools available to the clinician are not perfect, but they do yield valuable information in the clinical context. Knowledge of the measurement properties of clinical tools helps the clinician balance the information gained from these tools. The negative predictive values of clinical examination and MRI for ACL tear and meniscal pathology are higher than the positive predictive values. This means that if the clinical examination and MRI are negative for injury, the chance of the patient having an injury is low. However, if the tests are positive, it does not mean that the clinician can always reliably rule the diagnosis in.

- **Treatment of ACL injuries in children**: This section addresses the fundamental clinical question: What are the treatment options for the child with an ACL injury? Once the clinician is certain of the injury diagnosis, he or she first needs to know the available treatment options and discuss these with the child and the child's parents/guardian. This discussion facilitates a shared decision on how best to manage the knee injury. The goals of treatment for the child with an ACL injury are to restore a stable, well-functioning knee that enables a healthy, active lifestyle.

### Knee MRI primary care ordering practices for nontraumatic knee pain: Compliance with ACR appropriateness criteria and its effect on clinical management [^111Psxeu]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2019). Low credibility.

To evaluate the appropriateness of MRI ordering practices and their effect on clinical management for nontraumatic knee pain, 196 consecutive MRIs were ordered from primary care clinics in a large public urban hospital over an 18-month period. ACR Appropriateness Criteria (AC) scores for nontraumatic knee pain were retrospectively calculated from medical record reviews. Records were also reviewed to assess whether knee MRI changed clinical management. Knee osteoarthritis grading was performed, and tests were conducted to identify differences in age, body mass index (BMI), gender, and ethnicity among appropriate and inappropriate MRIs.

Of the MRIs, 57% (108 knees) had "usually appropriate" (7–9) scores and 43% (88 knees) had "usually not appropriate" (1–3) scores (P > .1). Clinical management was changed in 26% of knees with "usually appropriate" scores and 20% of knees with "usually inappropriate" scores (P < .05). Furthermore, 70% of the knees with "usually appropriate" scores and 61% of the knees with "usually not appropriate" scores had moderate to severe osteoarthritis. Age, BMI, gender, and ethnicity had no significant effect on AC scores.

In conclusion, adherence to AC was low in patients referred from primary care for MRI for nontraumatic knee pain. Additional focus on reducing "appropriate" studies that do not impact clinical management, such as in cases with radiographically evident moderate to severe osteoarthritis, is warranted.

This article reviews the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of the native and reconstructed anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). MRI is the most accurate non-invasive modality to evaluate the ACL. Tears of the ACL manifest with direct and indirect signs. The reconstructed ACL has several complications, including re-tear and anterior arthrofibrosis, which are also accurately assessed using MRI.

### ESR essentials: MRI of the knee-practice recommendations by ESSR [^115gfjP5]. European Radiology (2024). Low credibility.

Many studies and systematic reviews have been published about MRI of the knee and its structures, discussing detailed anatomy, imaging findings, and correlations between imaging and clinical findings. This paper includes evidence-based recommendations for a general radiologist regarding the choice of imaging sequences and reporting basic MRI examinations of the knee. We recommend using clinicians' terminology when it is applicable to the imaging findings, for example, when reporting meniscal, ligament and tendon, or cartilage pathology. The intent is to standardize reporting language and to make reports less equivocal. The aim of the paper is to improve the usefulness of the MRI report by understanding the strengths and limitations of the MRI exam with regard to clinical correlation. We hope the implementation of these recommendations into radiological practice will increase diagnostic accuracy and consistency by avoiding pitfalls and reducing overcalling of pathology on MRI of the knee.

- **Clinical relevance statement**: The recommendations presented here are meant to aid general radiologists in planning and assessing studies to evaluate acute and chronic knee findings by advocating the use of unequivocal terminology and discussing the strengths and limitations of MRI examination of the knee.

- **Key points**
- On MRI, the knee should be examined and assessed in three orthogonal imaging planes.
- The basic general protocol must yield T2-weighted fluid-sensitive and T1-weighted images.
- The radiological assessment should include evaluation of ligamentous structures, cartilage.

### New-generation 0.55 T MRI of the knee-initial clinical experience and comparison with 3 T MRI [^116vSqfs]. Investigative Radiology (2024). Low credibility.

This prospective single-center study was approved by the local ethics committee, and written informed consent was obtained from each patient. Twenty-five consecutive adult patients (11 women, 14 men; median age, 38 years; range, 21–63 years) who consented to repeat MRI of the symptomatic knee were included. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed between August 2022 and February 2023 for queries regarding internal derangement in all knees. The study inclusion criteria were: adult patients (age ≥ 18 years); valid referral for MRI of the knee with suspected internal derangement including suspected meniscal, tendon, ligament, chondral, and/or bone pathology after acute trauma; available signed consent for study participation. Exclusion criteria included general MRI contraindications such as any installed stimulating device like cardiac pacemakers, and prior arthroplasty of the symptomatic knee. All patients who consented to study participation were included within the given time interval.

In one setting, 0.55 T (Siemens MAGNETOM Free. Max; Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen, Germany) and 3 T MRI (Siemens MAGNETOM Prisma) were performed on the symptomatic knee. Standard diagnostic and routinely clinically used imaging protocols were employed. The protocol parameters are summarized in Table 1. The 0.55 T MRI was conducted using a 6-channel flex-phased array coil (size medium), and the 3 T MRI used an 8-channel receive-transmit knee coil. The 0.55 T system is commercially available. Upon purchase with the scanner provided, deep learning image reconstruction was also implemented.

### Juvenile idiopathic arthritis of the knee: Is contrast needed to score disease activity when using an augmented MRI protocol comprising PD-weighted sequences [^114WspaJ]. European Radiology (2023). Low credibility.

To compare unenhanced versus enhanced knee joint magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for assessing disease activity of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), the study involved the following:

- **Methods**: Fifty-three knee joint MRI examinations were conducted on a 3-Tesla system in 27 patients (mean age: 11.40 ± 3.61 years; 21 females, 6 males). The MRI protocols included PD-weighted sequences in addition to the standard protocol. JIA subgroups consisted of oligoarticular arthritis (n = 16), extended oligoarthritis (n = 6), rheumatoid factor-negative polyarticular arthritis (n = 3), enthesitis-related arthritis (n = 1), and psoriatic arthritis (n = 1). MR images were retrospectively analyzed by three experienced radiologists in two reading sessions using the JAMRIS (juvenile arthritis MRI scoring) system and a modified IPSG (international prophylaxis study group) classification. In the first reading, only unenhanced MR images were evaluated. In the second reading, all images before and after contrast medium application were included to prevent bias. An interval of at least two weeks was set between the two readings. The clinical JADAS10 (juvenile arthritis disease activity score) was calculated, incorporating clinical assessment and laboratory workup, and then correlated with MRI scores. Statistical analysis included Pearson's correlation for comparing two scoring results of unenhanced and enhanced MRI, and intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) for inter- and intra-reader agreement. Diagnostic accuracy was calculated using ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curve analysis.

### Feasibility of an accelerated 2d-multi-contrast knee MRI protocol using deep-learning image reconstruction: A prospective intraindividual comparison with a standard MRI protocol [^112qgUw8]. European Radiology (2022). Low credibility.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the knee is among the most commonly performed MRI examinations and requires about 15 minutes of acquisition time. Reference standards for knee MRI are proton density (PD) and T1-weighted turbo spin-echo (TSE) sequences due to the excellent tissue contrast and high in-plane spatial resolution, which allow for good assessment of meniscal, ligamentous, and cartilaginous injuries.

Due to their anisotropic voxel size, two-dimensional (2D) TSE sequences require the acquisition of different image planes separately, which is time-consuming. One approach to accelerate MRI of the knee is the use of three-dimensional (3D) TSE techniques. These techniques generate isotropic data sets of higher spatial resolution, allowing virtually any image plane to be created from a single parental data set. Although technical developments can provide accelerated imaging, primarily based on parallel imaging (PI) acceleration, the acquisition time of a high-quality isotropic data set with 3D TSE still requires around 5 to 10 minutes. Moreover, with increasing acceleration in PI, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) decreases rapidly, while residual artifacts are generally increased, limiting the achievable speed.

Another innovative technique commonly used to accelerate MRI is compressed sensing (CS), which requires only a reduced set of data points. While SNR is preserved better than with PI alone, CS tends to oversimplify image content, resulting in residual blurring and a loss of realistic image textures.

The latest promising approaches to overcome these drawbacks are deep-learning (DL) algorithms.

### What's new in the use of MRI in the orthopaedic trauma patient [^111hFL2w]. Injury (2014). Low credibility.

MRI has been established as an essential tool for accurate diagnosis in patients with musculoskeletal trauma. Its major advantages include excellent soft tissue contrast, high spatial resolution, and lack of ionizing radiation. Although plain radiographs remain the basic tool for diagnosis and treatment planning in bone fractures, assisted by CT in pelvic, spine, and large joint injuries, there are specific circumstances that require MRI. For instance, tendinous, ligamentous, intraarticular structures such as the cartilage and menisci, and intramedullary injuries are seen mostly with MRI.

Volumetric 3D techniques are now commercially available and provide higher spatial resolution, which improves anatomic detail, allows multiplanar reformations, and reduces acquisition time. Newer applications focusing on quantitative rather than morphologic imaging, such as relaxometry and diffusion tensor imaging, may become paramount in treatment planning in the near future. Software improvements reduce metal-induced artefacts, thereby allowing imaging of postoperative patients with metallic implants.

A tendency towards a structured reporting pattern and standardized medical communication needs to be further explored for the benefit of orthopaedic surgeons, radiologists, and patients.

### Association between knee magnetic resonance imaging markers and knee symptoms over 6–9 years in young adults [^111GwJK1]. Rheumatology (2024). Low credibility.

The presence of cartilage defects and bone marrow lesions (BMLs) assessed through semiquantitative methods has long been established to be associated with knee symptoms. Most studies have reported a consistent association of BMLs with knee pain in patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA). Similarly, cartilage defects, especially higher-grade cartilage defects, have been found to be associated with knee symptoms. However, the literature examining the association of MRI anomalies with knee symptoms has primarily focused on elderly participants or patients with confirmed knee OA. There is a lack of studies examining the association between MRI-based morphological or structural markers and knee symptoms in a general middle-aged population. It is essential to understand the structural correlates of knee pain in early life (possibly representing early knee OA) to develop targeted preventive and treatment strategies for early knee OA. Hence, our aim was to describe the associations between OA-related MRI biomarkers and knee symptoms over 6–9 years in middle-aged adults.

### Costs and effectiveness of a brief MRI examination of patients with acute knee injury [^111KVFbj]. European Radiology (2009). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to assess the costs and effectiveness of selective short magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients with acute knee injury. A model was developed to evaluate the selective use of MRI in patients with acute knee injury and no fracture on radiography, based on the results of a trial in which 208 patients were randomized between radiography only and radiography plus MRI. We analyzed medical (diagnostic and therapeutic) costs, quality of life, duration of diagnostic workup, number of additional diagnostic examinations, time absent from work, and time to convalescence during a 6-month follow-up period.

Quality of life was lowest (EuroQol at 6 weeks 0.61 [95% CI 0.54–0.67]); duration of diagnostic workup, absence from work, and time to convalescence were longest; and the number of diagnostic examinations was largest with radiography only. These outcomes were more favorable for both MRI strategies (EuroQol at 6 weeks 0.72 [95% CI 0.67–0.77] for both). Mean total costs were 2,593 euros (95% CI 1,815–3,372) with radiography only, 2,116 euros (95% CI 1,488–2,743) with radiography plus MRI, and 1,973 euros (95% CI 1,401–2,543) with selective MRI. The results suggest that selective use of a short MRI examination saves costs and potentially increases effectiveness in patients with acute knee injury without a fracture on radiography.

### Association between knee magnetic resonance imaging markers and knee symptoms over 6–9 years in young adults [^116ReU5E]. Rheumatology (2024). Low credibility.

Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a prevalent disorder of the joint characterized by knee pain, stiffness, and reduced mobility. The global prevalence of knee OA is estimated to be over 350 million, contributing up to 60% of the burden of all sites of OA. Knee OA imparts substantial direct and indirect health economic burdens on individuals and society globally.

Radiographic examination (X-ray) of the knee joint has been widely used as a tool to diagnose radiographic OA (ROA) and various grading scales, such as the Kellgren–Lawrence (KL) scale, are commonly used to define ROA, typically KL grade ≥ 2. However, early underlying knee OA changes, such as early articular cartilage abnormalities, are often unnoticed in radiographs. Radiographic examination is unreliable in identifying individuals with early knee OA. Knee OA often progresses unrecognized until it advances to an irreversible stage, and significant articular degradation has typically already occurred by the time definitive knee OA, based on radiographic evaluation such as KL grade ≥ 2, can be ascertained. Since early knee OA can start long before it becomes evident on radiographs, more sensitive techniques such as MRI are being explored for the early diagnosis of knee OA.

### Magnetic resonance imaging of the knee for chronological age estimation-a systematic review [^1167kuDf]. European Radiology (2023). High credibility.

In Fig. 2, the proportion of males or females with a mature knee per age interval (15–23 years) is presented. The curves are estimated using a logistic regression function, with age as the independent variable and mature/not-mature as the dependent variable. The model estimates the probability of having a mature knee as a function of age.

The data clearly show how the results differ between the studies. For example, the maturation of the knee for males seems to appear later in the studies by Kramer et al. and Dedouit et al. than in the studies by Vieth and Ottow et al.

We calculated the risk of misclassification, i.e. the risk that a minor (an individual 17 years or younger) would be misclassified as an adult (an individual 18 years or older) or that an adult would be misclassified as a minor, in the age interval of 15 to 21 years for each of the studies.

- **Figure 3**: Illustrates the results based on data from the study by Ottow et al.

- **Table 3**: The results for all grading systems and all studies are presented. The risk of misclassification varies between studies. The risk of misclassification is generally much higher in females than in males until the age of 17, at which point males are more likely to be misclassified. For females, where the knee matures earlier, the highest risk of misclassification is between 16 and 18 years of age. For males, the risk is highest between the ages of 17 and 18 years.

### Reduction in inappropriate MRI knee studies after implementation of an appropriateness checklist: Experience at a tertiary care centre [^114jJWYt]. European Journal of Radiology (2020). Low credibility.

To evaluate the reduction in inappropriate knee MRI requests, following the implementation of a mandatory knee MRI appropriateness checklist, a retrospective review was performed at a single tertiary care centre. A knee MRI appropriateness checklist was developed based on the ACR Appropriateness Criteria, and adherence from referring physicians was mandatory. Reports from 200 consecutive knee MRI studies one year prior to implementation were compared to 200 consecutive knee MRI studies following implementation. The presence of moderate or greater osteoarthritis on MRI reports was used as a marker for inappropriate knee MRIs.

Patient demographics, wait times, the number of knee MRIs, and the number of all MRIs at our centre over a six-month period post-intervention and pre-intervention were recorded. Differences between pre-intervention and post-intervention presence of moderate or greater osteoarthritis, patient demographics, wait times, and number of MRIs were analyzed.

A significant decrease was found in moderate or greater grade osteoarthritis following the intervention, decreasing from 36.5% to 20.5% (73 studies versus 41 studies, p = 0.023). Of these, the most profound decrease occurred in studies with severe osteoarthritis, with an 80% decrease (35 studies versus 7 studies, p < 0.001). Post-intervention, 48% fewer knee MRIs were performed in the same time interval (652 studies pre-intervention versus 336 studies post-intervention, p < 0.001). No significant differences were found in the patient demographics.

### MR imaging of anterior knee pain: A pictorial essay [^115JbL5B]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2013). Low credibility.

Anterior knee pathology is a frequent cause of joint pain and limitation of function and mobility among patients presenting to an orthopaedic department. Proper recognition and treatment of pathologic conditions depend on the knowledge of normal anatomy and the various abnormalities that affect this area of the knee, which may present with anterior knee pain. A broad array of benign and malignant processes may manifest as anterior knee discomfort, and this common clinical entity is among the most frequent indications for MR imaging of the lower extremities. Clinical history and physical examination are also of paramount importance in diagnosis.

The disorders causing anterior knee pain can be categorized and differentiated primarily according to their location. Traumatic or non-traumatic disorders of the patella, patellar retinacula, quadriceps and patellar tendons, and supra- or infrapatellar fat pad can be the source of symptoms. This article includes a comprehensive pictorial essay of the characteristic MR features of common and uncommon disorders causing anterior knee pain. For accurate assessment of this clinical problem, a radiologist should be able to identify typical MR imaging patterns that contribute to establishing the correct diagnosis and thus tailoring appropriate therapy.

### ESR essentials: MRI of the knee-practice recommendations by ESSR [^112ZYzcE]. European radiology (2024). Low credibility.

MRI of the knee is a common examination performed in both outpatient clinics and for hospitalized patients. The indications for this imaging technique vary extensively. In the knee, MRI is especially useful for the assessment of soft tissues following acute sports-related injuries. In cases of chronic knee issues, the range widens to encompass chronic overuse and inflammation. Neoplasms and osteomyelitis are also indications in knee imaging, although not specific to the knee itself.

Often, the indication given is non-specific, and for initial assessment, a radiology department needs a primary standard MRI protocol for the knee. A well-adjusted protocol can detect most knee pathologies, and the few that require further examinations can be referred or recalled for additional sequences. The European Society of Musculoskeletal Radiology (ESSR) sport imaging protocol might be used as a baseline.

The recommendations presented here are meant to aid general radiologists in planning studies for, and assessing, acute and chronic findings in the knee. The assessments of bone tumors, generalized bone marrow abnormalities, and/or osteomyelitis are not knee-specific entities and are thus not included in this paper.

- **Good practice recommendations**: The recommendations are considered good practice and are meant as a "base camp" knee MRI. These should not prevent the implementation of technical improvements or a more refined radiological evaluation. Although we do not recommend a structured report for knee MRI, the reporting of certain pathologies requires standardized assessments.

### Spectrum of injuries associated with paediatric ACL tears: An MRI pictorial review [^112GA3WM]. Insights into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

- **Posterior lateral meniscus**: The meniscofemoral ligament of Wrisberg and/or Humphrey, and rarely the oblique menisco-meniscal ligament, merge with the posterior lateral meniscus, complicating the assessment for tears. This has been well studied in adults. Practically speaking, if the ligament-to-meniscus attachment appears irregular or extends to a slice where the fibula is visible, a tear is likely present [Fig. 7].

Fig. 7 describes the posterior lateral meniscus tear:

- **Sagittal PD image**: Illustrates a cleft between the posterior third of the lateral meniscus (arrow) and the meniscofemoral ligament of Wrisberg (arrowhead). These structures are normally separate medially, near the intercondylar notch; note that this slice contains the patellar tendon (curved arrow) but merge laterally.
- **Normal appearance on lateral slice**: Where the fibular head is visible (curved arrow), the posterior lateral meniscus appears as a single triangular structure.
- **Oblique, mainly vertical undisplaced tear**: This tear of the posterior lateral meniscus (arrow) reveals an abnormal cleft when present laterally on an image where the fibular head is visible.
- **Complex tear of the same region of meniscus**: This is also indicated by an arrow.

### Magnetic resonance imaging of articular cartilage [^111ytTE8]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2001). Low credibility.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the optimal modality for assessing articular cartilage due to its superior soft tissue contrast, direct visualization of articular cartilage, and multiplanar capability. Despite these advantages, there has been disagreement about the efficacy of MRI of articular cartilage. The reason for this controversy is multifactorial, partly attributable to the lack of optimized pulse sequences for articular cartilage.

The authors review the state of the art of MRI of articular cartilage and cartilage repair procedures. They discuss future directions in imaging strategies, methods being developed to measure cartilage thickness and volume, and propose an MRI protocol to evaluate cartilage that is achievable on most MRI scanners. This protocol is vendor independent, practical (time and cost-efficient), and accepted and used by a majority of musculoskeletal radiologists.

### Contrast-enhanced high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging of autologous cartilage implants of the knee joint [^114YUE25]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (2005). Low credibility.

Over the past decade, a number of interventions for durable cartilage repair have emerged. Magnetic resonance (MR) tomography is an excellent noninvasive method for monitoring cartilage repair tissues throughout the postsurgical period. However, evaluating cartilage morphology after matrix-based autologous cartilage implantation (ACI) with MR imaging (MRI) still remains a challenge. In this study, we combined a high-resolution cartilage-sensitive fast-spin echo (FSE) sequence with intravenous application of a contrast agent to enhance synovial fluid. Two independent musculoskeletal radiologists interpreted the images for the thickness, length, and surface of the cartilage implants.

A multivariate two-way analysis of variance with two repeated measures was performed and showed that the evaluation of cartilage implant morphology was significantly improved after the application of gadodiamide on proton density FSE images. Contrast-enhanced MRI of articular cartilages is a promising technique in the postoperative follow-up of patients after ACI.

### Visualization of concurrent anterolateral and anterior cruciate ligament injury on magnetic resonance imaging [^112MpCzQ]. Arthroscopy (2020). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the ability to visualize the anterolateral ligament (ALL) on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and to identify ALL injuries in both an intact-anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) cohort and a torn-ACL cohort. Additionally, the study aimed to assess inter-rater reliability between two radiologists regarding the aforementioned assessment.

- **Methods**: MRIs that met the inclusion and exclusion criteria were categorized into a control group (ACL-intact) and a study group (ACL-injured). Two radiologists independently analyzed the MRIs for data points pertaining to demographics, ALL visualization, presence of ALL injury, and concomitant knee abnormalities. The inter-rater reliabilities for visualizing the ALL and identifying ALL injuries were also assessed.

- **Results**: The control and study groups consisted of 116 and 82 MRIs, respectively. Although age varied between the two groups, the sex distribution was similar. Both radiologists visualized at least part of the ALL in more than 95% of MRIs, irrespective of ACL integrity, demonstrating near-perfect agreement (kappa = 0.92). The mean incidence of ALL injury in the ACL-injured group was 53.05%, with minimal inter-rater agreement (kappa = 0.38). Segond fractures were noted in a mean of 13.95% of MRIs with concomitant ALL and ACL injuries.

- **Conclusions**: The ALL was reliably visualized on MRI regardless of whether the ACL was intact or torn. However, ALL injuries were not reliably diagnosed on MRI when an ACL tear was present. Poor interobserver reliability indicates the potential for false-positive and false-negative interpretations. These findings suggest that, in this study, ALL injuries could not be reliably identified.

### Magnetic resonance imaging of the knee for chronological age estimation: A systematic review [^117JmatY]. European Radiology (2023). Low credibility.

The risk for misclassification is notable in the reviewed studies. These studies were deemed too heterogeneous concerning MRI protocols, grading systems, and populations; therefore, a meta-analysis was not conducted. Even among studies using the same grading system, variations in population and MRI protocol hindered meta-analysis feasibility. As a result, individual study results are presented. These results are detailed separately for males and females and focus on the most relevant classification stages for age determination, covering individuals both over and under 18 years.

Among the 13 studies reviewed, 4 presented data as stage per age, requiring no recalculations. For the remaining nine studies, recalculations were performed for six. However, two studies could not be included in the analysis due to missing information regarding minimum and maximum ages, essential for recalculations. Additionally, one study had sufficient information for only six participants.

### Is magnetic resonance imaging overused among patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty [^116KJEpe]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2024). High credibility.

The results show that out of 869 total knee arthroplasties (TKAs), 177 cases (20.4%) had preconsultation MRIs. Of these, 65 MRIs were excluded because they were conducted more than 18 months before consulting with an orthopedic surgeon. For the remaining 112 preconsult MRIs that met the inclusion criteria, 87 (77.7%) were determined to be clinically unnecessary. In detail, 18 MRIs (20.7%) were ordered without prior first-line radiography, and 69 MRIs (79.3%) were ordered despite the presence of radiographic evidence of moderate-to-severe knee osteoarthritis (OA). Overall, among the 869 reviewed TKAs, 87 cases (10.0%) had a preconsult MRI deemed clinically unnecessary, which amounted to a cost of $20,706 at our institution.

### Magnetic resonance imaging of the knee for chronological age estimation-a systematic review [^112vsz3U]. European Radiology (2023). Low credibility.

The literature search yielded 2529 references to be screened (see Fig. 1). Of these, 39 were reviewed in full text. A total of 16 articles were considered eligible since they met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Of these, 13 had low or moderate risk of bias and are included in the analysis. The risk of bias chart is shown in Supplement 5. Three articles had high risk of bias due to various reasons: one had an inadequate description of the MRI method, another lacked complete information regarding birth date, and one had several limitations. See Supplement 2 for the list of excluded studies. The characteristics of the included studies are presented in Supplement 4.

- **Figure 1: Flow chart of literature selection**

- **Study characteristics**: Out of the 13 studies, 9 were retrospective and 4 prospective. The studies were conducted in Iran, Turkey, Germany, Sweden, France, and the United States. The study population consisted of various subjects, including patients who underwent MRI for assessment of traumatic or degenerative changes to the knee joint, healthy volunteers (4 studies), and individuals assessed due to legal reasons (1 study). The information provided regarding the study population was sparse in most papers.

The studies used 6 different grading systems for evaluating the maturation stage of the knee on MRI: Schmeling and Kellinghaus, Vieth, Dedouit, Dedouit and Kellinghaus (modified version of Schmeling), Jopp, and Schmeling. The MRI grading systems differ both in terms of the number and the definition of stages of maturation, with stages varying between 3 and 5, including up to 11 substages.

### A systematic review and meta-analysis of the diagnostic accuracy of MRI for suspected ACL and meniscal tears of the knee [^115ijErj]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2016). High credibility.

To determine the diagnostic accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasound (US) in diagnosing anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), medial meniscus, and lateral meniscus tears in people with suspected ACL and/or meniscal tears, a comprehensive review was conducted.

- **Methods**: MEDLINE, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library were searched from inception to March 2014. All prospective studies of the diagnostic accuracy of MRI or US, using arthroscopy as the reference standard, were included in the systematic review. Studies with a retrospective design and those with evidence of verification bias were excluded. The methodological quality of included studies was assessed using the QUADAS-2 tool. A meta-analysis of studies evaluating MRI was performed to calculate the pooled sensitivity and specificity for each target condition, using a bivariate model with random effects. Sub-group and sensitivity analyses were used to examine the effect of methodological and other study variables.

- **Results**: There were 14 studies included in the meta-analysis of the accuracy of MRI for ACL tears, 19 studies for medial meniscal tears, and 19 studies for lateral meniscal tears. The summary estimates of sensitivity and specificity of MRI were 87% (95% CI 77–94%) and 93% (95% CI 91–96%), respectively, for ACL tears; 89% (95% CI 83–94%) and 88% (95% CI 82–93%), respectively, for medial meniscal tears; and 78% (95% CI 66–87%) and 95% (95% CI 91–97%), respectively, for lateral meniscal tears. Magnetic field strength had no significant effect on accuracy. Most studies had a high or unclear risk of bias.
