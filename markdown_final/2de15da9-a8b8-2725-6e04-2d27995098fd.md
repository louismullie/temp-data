## Question

Causes of
Increase in RDW

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the causes of an increased red blood cell distribution width (RDW). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the hematologic definition and normal range of RDW. Then, I should categorize the major etiologic buckets that raise RDW. Next, I will detail each bucket with mechanisms and examples, including anemia types, hemolysis, inflammation, nutritional deficiencies, liver disease, renal disease, and bone marrow disorders. After that, I should consider special contexts like COVID-19, sepsis, and pediatrics. Finally, I will synthesize a practical diagnostic approach and highlight prognostic implications, making sure I verify claims against the cited literature as I go.

> Let me first confirm the definition and normal range so I don't anchor on a misconception. RDW is the coefficient of variation of red blood cell volume, typically reported as RDW-CV, with a reference interval around 11.0–16.0% in adults, though instrument-specific ranges vary, and RDW-SD is an absolute width in femtoliters that is less influenced by MCV shifts, which matters when interpreting macrocytosis or microcytosis [^1cd238c5] [^8351bcac].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about mechanisms before I categorize the causes. The major buckets that increase RDW are: nutritional deficiency anemias, hemolysis and blood loss, inflammatory and chronic disease states, liver disease, renal disease, bone marrow disorders, and physiologic or iatrogenic contributors. I should also remember that RDW rises when there is heterogeneity in RBC size from mixed populations or ineffective erythropoiesis, and that delayed clearance of smaller, older RBCs can widen the distribution even when MCV is unchanged [^1cd238c5] [^031a2a5b].

> I will now examine nutritional deficiency anemias, starting with iron deficiency. Wait, let me verify the sequence: in early iron deficiency, RDW often increases before MCV falls, reflecting anisocytosis from mixed microcytic and normocytic cells. This is why RDW can be an early signal of iron-restricted erythropoiesis, and it helps distinguish iron deficiency from thalassemia trait where RDW is often normal despite microcytosis [^8351bcac] [^5537cb91]. I should also confirm that B12 and folate deficiencies cause macrocytosis with anisocytosis and thus elevate RDW, and that combined deficiencies can produce even greater heterogeneity, which aligns with standard teaching and observational data [^1cd238c5] [^3d748fae].

> Next, I should review hemolysis and blood loss. Let me think about kinetics: acute blood loss drives reticulocytosis, and reticulocytes are larger than mature RBCs, so a reticulocyte surge increases RDW transiently. Similarly, hemolysis releases variably sized RBCs and reticulocytes, widening the size distribution, and hemolytic anemias often show elevated RDW with appropriate reticulocytosis, which fits the pathophysiology of ineffective or accelerated erythropoiesis [^1cd238c5] [^14f6dc31].

> I need to check the inflammatory and chronic disease mechanisms carefully. Chronic inflammation impairs iron trafficking, suppresses erythropoietin, and shortens RBC survival, yielding anemia of chronic disease with anisocytosis and elevated RDW. Cytokines like IL-6 and TNF-α directly inhibit erythroid maturation, and observational cohorts show graded associations between RDW and inflammatory markers such as CRP and ESR independent of anemia, supporting inflammation as a driver of RBC heterogeneity [^f83acf0b] [^3335fa2b]. But wait, what if the patient has IBD or rheumatoid arthritis? In those conditions, both disease activity and nutritional deficits converge to elevate RDW, reinforcing its role as an integrative marker of inflammatory stress on erythropoiesis [^7dc68c75] [^95be10d3].

> Let me consider liver disease next. I should confirm that macrocytosis with anisocytosis is common in liver disease due to altered lipid membrane composition, abnormal hemoglobin synthesis, and nutritional cofactor deficiencies, all of which increase RDW. Indeed, alcoholic liver disease and cirrhosis frequently show elevated RDW even outside overt anemia, and expert correspondence highlights high-normal MCV plus high RDW as a clue to liver disease or early megaloblastic processes [^e9a35a57].

> I will now examine renal disease. Chronic kidney disease impairs erythropoietin production and causes uremic toxins that shorten RBC lifespan and blunt erythropoiesis, producing normocytic or mildly microcytic anemia with elevated RDW. Multiple CKD cohorts show RDW independently predicts cardiovascular events and mortality even after adjustment for hemoglobin, suggesting RDW captures dysregulated erythropoiesis and systemic stress beyond anemia alone [^50534230] [^738fa0b1].

> But wait, what if the marrow itself is the problem? Bone marrow disorders such as myelodysplastic syndromes, aplastic anemia, and clonal hematopoiesis disrupt normal erythroid maturation, yielding macrocytosis, anisocytosis, and elevated RDW. In allogeneic transplant survivors, persistent RDW elevation years later has been linked to underlying dyserythropoiesis or emerging clonal disease, underscoring RDW as a sentinel of marrow dysfunction in the right context [^243e4f54] [^3d748fae].

> Next, I should review special contexts where RDW has prognostic salience. In COVID-19, multiple high-quality cohorts show that RDW greater than 14.5% at admission associates with markedly higher mortality, and rising RDW during hospitalization tracks with deteriorating outcomes. Mechanistically, this fits slowed RBC production kinetics amid heightened leukocyte and platelet turnover in inflammatory states, though RDW itself is likely a nonspecific integrator rather than causal [^dcb7266d] [^7ed56761]. In sepsis, early increases in RDW predict mortality independent of severity scores, again aligning with inflammation-driven erythropoietic stress and oxidative injury to RBCs [^4b4c540e] [^3335fa2b].

> I should double-check pediatric considerations. In young children, RDW can help screen for iron deficiency anemia, with studies suggesting utility around RDW thresholds near 14–15%, though sensitivity and specificity vary by age and setting. Importantly, RDW is less affected by acute infection than ferritin, which supports its use as a screening adjunct in high-burden settings, but I need to emphasize that RDW is not a standalone diagnostic test and should be integrated with hemoglobin, MCV, and reticulocyte indices [^5537cb91] [^ee97da86].

> Let me synthesize a practical diagnostic approach, and I should confirm each step against the literature. First, verify the CBC instrument and reference range, then assess MCV to classify microcytic, normocytic, or macrocytic patterns. Second, review the reticulocyte count and index to distinguish hypoproliferative from hyperproliferative states. Third, interpret RDW in tandem with MCV: high RDW with microcytosis points toward iron deficiency or mixed defects, with normocytosis toward inflammation or early deficiency, and with macrocytosis toward B12/folate deficiency, liver disease, or marrow disorders. Fourth, layer in iron studies, B12/folate, renal and liver panels, and inflammatory markers as indicated. Finally, consider longitudinal RDW trends, because rising RDW in stable patients can herald clinical deterioration even before hemoglobin drops, which is particularly relevant in heart failure, CKD, and inflammatory diseases [^1cd238c5] [^14f6dc31] [^5b0571b6].

> Hold on, I should verify prognostic implications so I don't overstate causality. Elevated RDW consistently predicts higher all-cause and cardiovascular mortality across diverse populations, including community cohorts, heart failure, coronary disease, CKD, and critical illness, and this association persists after adjustment for anemia and traditional risk factors. Mechanistically, RDW likely integrates inflammation, oxidative stress, nutritional deficits, and impaired erythropoiesis, making it a robust, low-cost barometer of systemic vulnerability rather than a disease-specific marker [^33541999] [^f036f232] [^50534230] [^cfd2081a].

> In summary, I need to ensure the message is precise: RDW increases when RBC size becomes heterogeneous due to nutritional deficits, hemolysis or blood loss, inflammation, organ dysfunction, or marrow disorders, and it often rises before anemia manifests, which is why it is a sensitive but nonspecific signal. Clinically, interpret RDW alongside MCV, reticulocytes, and disease-specific labs, and track trends because rising RDW can flag deteriorating biology and worse outcomes across many conditions [^1cd238c5] [^3d748fae] [^33541999].

An elevated RDW reflects **anisocytosis** (red cell size variation) and is caused by **nutritional deficiencies** (iron, B12, folate), **hemolysis or blood loss**, and **chronic inflammation or disease** (CKD, liver disease, malignancy, autoimmune disorders) [^1cd238c5] [^3d748fae]. It can also rise with **bone marrow disorders** (MDS, aplastic anemia, leukemia) [^243e4f54], **recent transfusion**, or **medications** (cytotoxics, immunosuppressants) [^e9a35a57]. RDW is a **nonspecific marker** of erythropoietic stress and is best interpreted with MCV, reticulocyte count, and clinical context [^14f6dc31].

---

## Nutritional deficiencies

Nutritional deficiencies are a **major cause of elevated RDW**, reflecting impaired erythropoiesis and anisocytosis [^1cd238c5].

- **Iron deficiency anemia**: Microcytosis with anisocytosis; RDW often rises before MCV falls, aiding early detection [^8351bcac].

- **Vitamin B12 or folate deficiency**: Macrocytosis with anisocytosis; RDW is typically elevated [^1cd238c5].

- **Combined deficiencies**: Mixed microcytic/macrocytic populations cause marked anisocytosis and high RDW [^notfound].

---

## Hemolysis and blood loss

Hemolysis and blood loss increase RDW by releasing **variably sized RBCs** and stimulating reticulocytosis [^1cd238c5].

- **Hemolytic anemia**: Reticulocytosis and fragmented RBCs increase size variance [^notfound].

- **Acute blood loss**: Reticulocytosis and mixed RBC populations elevate RDW [^notfound].

- **Recent transfusion**: Mixture of donor and recipient RBCs of different ages/sizes increases RDW [^notfound].

---

## Chronic inflammation and systemic diseases

Chronic inflammation and systemic diseases elevate RDW via **cytokine-mediated erythropoietic suppression**, iron restriction, and oxidative stress [^3335fa2b].

- **Chronic kidney disease**: Reduced EPO, uremic toxins, and iron-restricted erythropoiesis cause anisocytosis [^50534230].

- **Liver disease**: Macrocytosis, nutritional deficits, and altered RBC morphology increase RDW [^e9a35a57].

- **Autoimmune diseases**: Inflammation and immune-mediated RBC injury elevate RDW [^95be10d3].

- **Malignancy**: Chronic inflammation, bone marrow infiltration, and nutritional deficits contribute to anisocytosis [^3d748fae].

---

## Bone marrow disorders

Bone marrow disorders cause **ineffective erythropoiesis** and abnormal RBC morphology, markedly increasing RDW [^3d748fae].

- **Myelodysplastic syndromes**: Dyserythropoiesis and macrocytosis with anisocytosis [^notfound].

- **Aplastic anemia**: Mixed RBC populations and reticulocytosis elevate RDW [^notfound].

- **Leukemia**: Dysregulated erythropoiesis and abnormal RBC morphology increase RDW [^notfound].

---

## Medications and treatments

Certain medications and treatments can increase RDW by **impairing erythropoiesis** or altering RBC morphology [^1cd238c5].

- **Cytotoxic chemotherapy**: Marrow suppression and dysregulated erythropoiesis cause anisocytosis [^e9a35a57].

- **Immunosuppressive agents**: Methotrexate, azathioprine, and others can cause macrocytosis and anisocytosis [^notfound].

- **Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents**: Rapid reticulocytosis can transiently increase RDW [^notfound].

---

## Physiological and demographic factors

Physiological and demographic factors can modestly influence RDW. Aging is associated with **increased RDW** due to altered erythropoiesis and comorbidities [^237d2cde], and pregnancy produces a physiologic macrocytosis that can raise RDW [^notfound].

---

## Clinical significance and interpretation

RDW is a **nonspecific marker** of erythropoietic stress and should be interpreted with MCV, reticulocyte count, and clinical context [^14f6dc31]. Persistent elevation suggests ongoing pathology and is associated with adverse outcomes in many conditions, including cardiovascular disease, CKD, and malignancy [^33541999] [^50534230] [^3d748fae].

---

An elevated RDW reflects **anisocytosis** from diverse causes, including nutritional deficiencies, hemolysis, chronic inflammation, bone marrow disorders, medications, and physiological factors. It is a sensitive but nonspecific marker that, when interpreted with other indices and the clinical picture, helps identify underlying disease and guide further evaluation [^1cd238c5].

### The diagnostic red blood cell distribution width as a prognostic factor in acute myeloid leukemia [^3d748fae]. Blood Advances (2021). Medium credibility.

TO THE EDITOR:

The red blood cell distribution width (RDW) is a marker that describes the degree of heterogeneity of erythrocyte volume. Because it is part of the routine automated output of blood cell counters, the RDW is included in the diagnostic work-up of most hematologic diseases and is easily and inexpensively assessed. Red blood cells (RBCs) typically decrease in cellular volume across their lifespan, which is why a delayed clearance of older erythrocytes leads to higher RDW levels. Subsequently, a higher RDW mirrors a dysregulated erythrocyte homeostasis with either impaired erythropoiesis (including reticulocytosis and macrocytosis; eg, due to toxic effects) or abnormal (prolonged) RBC survival. Although, historically, the clinical meaning of the RDW was limited to the differential diagnosis of anemia, a wider applicability recently became evident. Increased RDW levels are associated with a higher mortality in healthy people, which has been linked to oxidative stress, poor nutritional status, and older age. Data also suggest that a high RDW defines a proinflammatory state, leading to a higher incidence of cardiovascular diseases, including heart failure, coronary heart disease, and cardiac mortality, as well as a greater likelihood of developing a variety of malignancies.

### Association of red blood cell distribution width with mortality risk in hospitalized adults with SARS-CoV-2 infection [^41570bef]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

RDW is the coefficient of variation in RBC volume, or the SD divided by the mean. An increase in RDW must therefore correspond to a decrease in mean RBC volume (MCV), an increase in RBC volume variance, or both. Previous studies, have found evidence in some specific conditions that RDW elevation is caused by delayed clearance of older RBCs. Because RBCs characteristically decrease in cellular volume across their lifespan, persistence of these older, smaller cells thus increases volume variance, and this clearance delay coincides with and offsets a net decrease in RBC production. These reports suggest the possibility that an elevated RDW in some circumstances may reflect a clinical state in which RBC production and turnover have slowed in the setting of increased production and turnover of leukocytes or platelets such as would occur in inflammation. Although a definitive mechanism for RDW elevation has not yet been established, there is evidence that RDW can provide robust risk-stratification among patients diagnosed with the same acute illness. In this study, our aim was to investigate whether an association exists between mortality risk and elevated RDW measured at hospital admission and during hospitalization in patients with COVID-19.

### Red cell distribution width as a new prognostic biomarker in refractory chronic graft – host disease [^06bb609a]. Haematologica (2024). Medium credibility.

Chronic graft- versus -host disease (cGvHD) is an important immunologic complication of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) that can affect multiple organs and lead to increased morbidity and mortality. Several adverse factors for survival in patients with cGvHD have been identified. Despite significant progress in the classifications of cGvHD, there is a need for improved and practical prognostication systems to address interpatient variability and achieve the goal of personalized treatment. In this study, we introduce red cell distribution width (RDW) as a new biomarker candidate that could enhance the development of personalized treatment strategies and risk stratifications for cGvHD.

Red cell distribution width is a measure of the variation of the mean corpuscular volume of red blood cells (RBC) and is routinely reported in most standard complete blood count results. Although RDW is affected to some degree by any type of anemia, the etiology of variation in RDW is considered to be multifactorial and is not completely understood. Multiple epidemiological and longitudinal observational studies have shown that higher RDW values are independently associated with increased all-cause, cardiovascular and cancer-related mortality. 7- Age, inflammation and the presence of clonal hematopoiesis are associated with increased RDW, but the association of RDW with mortality is independent of these factors.

Red cell distribution width has not been previously evaluated in patients with cGvHD. The primary objective of this study was to determine if an RDW cut-off value is associated with overall survival (OS) in patients with moderate or severe cGvHD enrolled on an observational, cross-sectional study (NCT00092235) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and to estimate the 5-year OS probability in patients with RDW values above and below the specified cut-off. Secondary objectives were to determine 5-year relapse-free survival, cumulative incidence of relapse, non-relapse mortality (NRM), and significant associations of RDW with clinical variables and other biomarkers in patients with RDW values above and below the established cut-off. All variables were prespecified in an analysis plan. Selected biomarkers of interest were divided into quartiles and the association of the four groups with OS was determined to establish binary cut-offs. Probabilities of survival were determined by the Kaplan-Meier method, with log-rank tests used to determine the difference in survival between groups. All P values are two-tailed. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.4 and GraphPad Prism 9.3.

### Role of red blood cell distribution width, as a prognostic indicator in COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^121e53c0]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2022). Medium credibility.

The red blood cell distribution width (RDW), an indicator of anisocytosis has emerged as a potential tool for risk stratification of critically ill patients with sepsis. Prognostic predictors are of paramount interest for prompt intervention and optimal utilization of the healthcare system in this ongoing context of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The current systematic review and meta-analysis aims to explore the utility of RDW in the prognosis of COVID-19 patients. A comprehensive screening of electronic databases was performed up to 30th April 2021 after enrolling in PROSPERO (CRD42020206685). Observational studies or interventional studies, evaluating the impact of RDW in COVID-19 outcomes (mortality and severity) are included in this meta-analysis. Our search retrieved 25 studies, with a total of 18,392 and 3,446 COVID-19 patients for mortality and disease severity outcomes. Deceased and critically ill patients had higher RDW levels on admission in comparison to survivors and non-severe patients (SMD = 0.46; 95%CI 0.31–0.71; I² = 88% and SMD = 0.46; 95%CI 0.26–0.67; I² = 60%, respectively). In a sub-group analysis of 2,980 patients, RDW > 14.5 has been associated with increased risk of mortality (OR = 2.73; 95%CI 1.96–3.82; I² = 56%). However, the evidences is of low quality. A higher level of RDW on admission in COVID-19 patients is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. However, further studies regarding the cut-off value of RDW are the need of the hour.

### Higher red cell distribution width and poorer hospitalization-related outcomes in elderly patients [^3aae4279]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Red cell distribution width (RDW), an index for variation of red blood cell (RBC) size, has been proposed as a potential marker for poorer outcomes in several aging-related diseases and conditions. We tested whether greater variability of RBC size, presented as a higher RDW value, predicts poor prognoses among hospitalized patients over 60years old.

Methods

We retrospectively collected data from older hospitalized patients aged ≥ 60years between January 2013 to December 2017 at Sutter Health, a large integrated health system in Northern California. The RDW was measured during hospital admission and categorized with 1% intervals (≤ 13.9, 14.0–14.9, 15.0–15.9, 16.0–16.9, 17.0–17.9 and ≥ 18.0%). The primary outcome was the rate of in-hospital mortality and secondary outcomes included 30-day re-admission rate and length of hospital stay (in days).

Results

A total of 167,292 admissions from 94,617 patients were included. The overall in-hospital mortality rate was 6.3%. As the RDW value increased, the rate of in-hospital mortality gradually increased from 2.7% for the lowest RDW category to 12.2% in the highest category (p-trend < 0.001). The overall 30-day re-admission rate after discharge was 12.5% and the rate of 30-day re-admission also increased with increasing RDW categories (7.4% in the lowest group vs. 15.8% in the highest group, p-trend < 0.001). Patients with the highest RDW values at admission stayed 1.5–2.0 times longer in the hospital than patients with lower RDW values who were admitted for the same causes.

Conclusions

Greater variability of RBC size is significantly associated with worse prognosis in hospitalized elderly patients, indicating higher mortality, greater risk of early re-admission, and longer hospital stay days. Risk stratification strategies for hospitalized elderly should include RDW value.

Elevated RDW at Admission and Mortality Risk

Patients whose RDW was greater than 14.5% at admission for a COVID-19 diagnosis had a mortality risk of 31%, whereas those with an RDW of 14.5% or less had a mortality risk of 11%. The RR of mortality for those with an elevated RDW was 2.73 (95% CI, 2.52–2.94). Age has previously been shown to be a risk factor for COVID-19 mortality. In patient groups stratified by age, elevated RDW remained associated with increased relative risk of mortality for patients younger than 50 years, 50 to 59 years, 60 to 69 years, and 80 years or older (Figure 1 and Table 2). For patients in the 70- to 79- year age group, the RR was elevated (1.45) but was not statistically significant. Relative risk was particularly elevated within 48 hours of admission, with patients with a normal RDW of 14.5% or less having a mortality of 0.8% (9 of 1175 patients) within 48 hours of admission, whereas the mortality rate for those with an RDW greater than 14.5% was 4.9% (23 of 470 patients), a risk ratio of 6.12. Risk ratios for different age groups were significantly different compared with each other, suggesting an effect modification, with an elevated RDW having a larger effect on mortality for younger patients (< 70 years) than it had for older patients.

Figure 1.
Elevated Red Blood Cell Distribution Width (RDW) at Hospital Admission and Mortality Among Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019

Across all age groups, an RDW greater than 14.5% measured at the time of admission was associated with a 31% mortality compared with an 11% mortality for patients whose RDW at admission was ≤ 14.5%. All increases in mortality are statistically significant except in the 70- to 80-year age group. Table 2 details age-stratified and RDW-stratified mortality rates.

Increasing RDW After Hospital Admission and Mortality Risk

We investigated whether changes in RDW after admission were associated with increased mortality risk for those with initially elevated RDW at hospital admission and those with normal RDW. Figure 3 shows that patients with an RDW of 14.5% or less at admission who died had an increasing mean RDW, whereas those with an RDW of 14.5% or less who were alive at discharge had a stable RDW. For all patients, an increasing RDW during hospitalization was associated with increased mortality risk: from 6% (95% CI, 4%-8%) to 24% (95% CI, 18%-30%) for those with a normal RDW at admission and from 22% (95% CI, 18%-26%) to 40% (95% CI, 33%-47%) for those with an elevated RDW at admission. Figure 3 shows that the mean RDW in the elevated group is 16.4 compared with 13.0 in the nonelevated group. In general, a 1.25-fold higher RDW reflects a 1.25-fold smaller MCV, a 1.25-fold larger SD of the RBC volume distribution, or a combination of smaller changes to both. The average MCV differed by a factor of only about 1.01 (89 fL vs 87.9 fL) (eFigures 5 and 6 in the Supplement). Although the true baseline RDW for the elevated RDW group is unknown, these results suggest that the major contributor to elevated RDW is an increase in variance of the RBC volume distribution instead of a decrease in MCV. Figure 3 also shows that those who do not survive have an average RDW increase of 1.5% during their first week of hospitalization, a significantly larger RDW increase than in all other groups. Few patients experienced greater than a 2% increase per week in RDW during their hospitalization, and the large increase in the elevated RDW group raises the possibility of a longer duration of disease for these patients at the time of admission.

### Association of red blood cell distribution width with mortality risk in hospitalized adults with SARS-CoV-2 infection [^7ed56761]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Importance

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an acute respiratory illness with a high rate of hospitalization and mortality. Biomarkers are urgently needed for patient risk stratification. Red blood cell distribution width (RDW), a component of complete blood counts that reflects cellular volume variation, has been shown to be associated with elevated risk for morbidity and mortality in a wide range of diseases.

Objective

To investigate whether an association between mortality risk and elevated RDW at hospital admission and during hospitalization exists in patients with COVID-19.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cohort study included adults diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection and admitted to 1 of 4 hospitals in the Boston, Massachusetts area (Massachusetts General Hospital, Brigham and Women's Hospital, North Shore Medical Center, and Newton-Wellesley Hospital) between March 4, 2020, and April 28, 2020.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The main outcome was patient survival during hospitalization. Measures included RDW at admission and during hospitalization, with an elevated RDW defined as greater than 14.5%. Relative risk (RR) of mortality was estimated by dividing the mortality of those with an elevated RDW by the mortality of those without an elevated RDW. Mortality hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs were estimated using a Cox proportional hazards model.

Results

A total of 1641 patients were included in the study (mean [SD] age, 62[18] years; 886 men [54%]; 740 White individuals [45%] and 497 Hispanic individuals [30%]; 276 nonsurvivors [17%]). Elevated RDW (> 14.5%) was associated with an increased mortality risk in patients of all ages. The RR for the entire cohort was 2.73, with a mortality rate of 11% in patients with normal RDW (1173) and 31% in those with an elevated RDW (468). The RR in patients younger than 50 years was 5.25 (normal RDW, 1% [n = 341]; elevated RDW, 8% [n = 65]); 2.90 in the 50- to 59-year age group (normal RDW, 8% [n = 256]; elevated RDW, 24% [n = 63]); 3.96 in the 60- to 69-year age group (normal RDW, 8% [n = 226]; elevated RDW, 30% [104]); 1.45 in the 70- to 79-year age group (normal RDW, 23% [n = 182]; elevated RDW, 33% [n = 113]); and 1.59 in those ≥ 80 years (normal RDW, 29% [n = 168]; elevated RDW, 46% [n = 123]). RDW was associated with mortality risk in Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for age, D-dimer (dimerized plasmin fragment D) level, absolute lymphocyte count, and common comorbidities such as diabetes and hypertension (hazard ratio of 1.09 per 0.5% RDW increase and 2.01 for an RDW > 14.5% vs ≤ 14.5%; P < .001). Patients whose RDW increased during hospitalization had higher mortality compared with those whose RDW did not change; for those with normal RDW, mortality increased from 6% to 24%, and for those with an elevated RDW at admission, mortality increased from 22% to 40%.

Conclusions and Relevance

Elevated RDW at the time of hospital admission and an increase in RDW during hospitalization were associated with increased mortality risk for patients with COVID-19 who received treatment at 4 hospitals in a large academic medical center network.

### Red cell distribution width and mortality in Hemodialysis Patients [^f5382a1b]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Red cell distribution width (RDW) is an index of red blood cell volume variability that has historically been used as a marker of iron deficiency anemia. More recently, studies have shown that elevated RDW is associated with higher mortality risk in the general population. However, there is lack of data demonstrating the association between RDW and mortality risk in hemodialysis (HD) patients. We hypothesized that higher RDW is associated with higher mortality in HD patients.

Study Design

Retrospective observational study using a large HD patient cohort.

Setting & Participants

109,675 adult maintenance HD patients treated in a large dialysis organization from January 1, 2007, to December 31, 2011.

Predictor

Baseline and time-varying RDW, grouped into 5 categories: < 14.5%, 14.5% to < 15.5%, 15.5% to < 16.5%, 16.5% to < 17.5%, and ≥ 17.5%. RDW of 15.5% to < 16.5% was used as the reference category.

Outcome

All-cause mortality.

Results

Mean age of study participants was 63 ± 15 (SD) years and the study cohort was 44% women. In baseline and time-varying analyses, there was a graded association between higher RDW and incrementally higher mortality risk. Receiver operating characteristic, net reclassification analysis, and integrated discrimination improvement analyses demonstrated that RDW is a stronger predictor of mortality as compared with traditional markers of anemia, such as hemoglobin, ferritin, and iron saturation values.

Limitations

Lack of comprehensive data that may be associated with both RDW and HD patient outcomes, such as blood transfusion data, socioeconomic status, and other unknown confounders; therefore, the possibility of residual confounding could not be excluded. Also, lack of information for cause of death; thus, cardiovascular mortality outcomes could not be examined.

Conclusions

In HD patients, higher RDW is associated with incrementally higher mortality risk. RDW is also a stronger predictor of mortality than traditional laboratory markers of anemia. Further studies are needed to determine the mechanisms underlying the association between RDW and mortality.

### Red cell distribution width and risk of coronary heart disease events [^53fc44b5]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

Red cell distribution width (RDW) has emerged as a powerful predictor of all-cause mortality in variety of cardiovascular settings. However, no data are available associating RDW with coronary heart disease (CHD) risk in a healthy and nationally representative multiethnic population. A total of 7,556 participants of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys 1999 to 2006 (age 41.5 ± 15.8 years, 60% women) were divided into 3 categories according to their 10-year Framingham risk of hard CHD events: < 10% (n = 6,173, reference category), 10% to 20% (n = 1,093, intermediate-risk category), and > 20% (n = 290, high-risk category). Unadjusted and adjusted multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed evaluating RDW as a predictor of CHD risk. Each unit increase (0.1) in RDW posed a statistically significant greater odds of being in the intermediate-risk category (odds ratio -1.35, 95% confidence interval 1.27 to 1.45, p < 0.001) and high-risk category (odds ratio -1.38, 95% confidence interval 1.25 to 1.53, p < 0.001) compared to the reference category, after adjusting for race, body mass index, estimated glomerular filtration rate, hemoglobin A1c, C-reactive protein, hemoglobin, and mean corpuscular volume. Additional adjustments with serum iron, vitamin B(12), and folic acid levels did not affect the association. Subsequently, we divided participants into 2 categories according to their anemia status (as defined by the World Health Organization) to evaluate its effect. An RDW level greater than the seventy-fifth percentile in both anemic and nonanemic participants was a significant predictor of greater CHD risk while RDW of the seventy-fifth percentile or less in anemic participants failed to predict CHD (compared to nonanemic participants with similar RDW as the reference category). In conclusion, a higher RDW appears to be a powerful independent predictor of future CHD risk.

### Red cell distribution width is a risk factor for hip fracture in elderly men without anemia [^8a1a57fa]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Red cell distribution width (RDW), routinely assessed as a component of a complete blood count (CBC), quantifies the variation in the size of red blood cells. It increases with age, and increased RDW predicts many aging-related diseases and mortality. However, whether it also predicts hip fracture is unknown. We prospectively evaluated the association between RDW and hip fracture using data from the Osteoporotic Fracture in Men (MrOS) study. RDW was measured in 3635 men (aged 71 to 99years) along with bone mineral density (BMD) in MrOS. RDW ranged from 11.3% to 32.9% (median 14.0%; interquartile range 13.5% to 14.8%) and was categorized into four groups (≤ 13.0%, 13.1% to 14.0%, 14.1% to 15.0%, ≥ 15.1%). Study participants with a hemoglobin level < 13.0g/dL were classified as having anemia. During an average 8.1years, 164 men suffered hip fractures. The risks of hip fractures increased with increase of RDW category. Furthermore, there was a significant interaction between anemia and RDW: An association between RDW and hip fractures was only observed in participants without anemia. In those without anemia, the relative hazard of hip fractures increased with increases in RDW category: Men in the highest RDW category had a 2.8 times higher risk of hip fractures than men in the lowest group (95% confidence interval 1.1 to 7.1). The risks of all-clinical fractures were also increased along with higher RDW values. Additionally, RDW was significantly associated with the risk of having a fall but not with femoral neck or total hip BMD. In conclusion, RDW and anemia defined by hemoglobin are widely available routine laboratory measurements that together could indicate increased risk of hip fracture, reflecting the neuromuscular effects of aging rather than lower hip BMD. © 2020 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

### Red cell distribution width as a marker of activity in inflammatory bowel disease: a narrative review [^7dc68c75]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

RDW in IBD

There are different proposed mechanisms that attempt to explain why RDW is elevated in active IBD and how this is correlated with disease activity. The most probable encountered etiologies involve anemia, and especially iron deficiency anemia (IDA), as well as the impact of inflammation and oxidative stress on the normal process of erythropoiesis.

Anemia in IBD seems to be multifactorial, with an estimated prevalence between 9–74%, while IDA represents the commonest type. Causes implicated include continuous microscopic or macroscopic blood loss from the ulcerated intestinal mucosa, nutritional deficits of vitamins and minerals (iron, folate, B12) due to decreased intake or absorption, effects of medication, and inflammatory insults in the process of hematopoiesis. The RDW value is directly affected and subsequently elevated in IDA, as well as in situations of B12 and folate deprivation, while it is known that the degree and severity of anemia in both Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are linked to disease activity.

IBD are chronic and relapsing inflammatory conditions of the gastrointestinal tract. Chronic inflammation through the exertional effect of cytokines — interleukin-1, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, interferon-γ — may cause impaired erythropoietin (EPO) production, alterations of red blood cell life span, diminished responsiveness of bone marrow to EPO and impaired iron metabolism, disrupting the normal process of hematopoiesis. Data from the international literature suggest that anemia in IBD is multifactorial and is considered to be a combination of IDA and anemia of chronic disease (ACD), caused by a series of negative effects of an activated immune system at different levels of erythropoiesis.

The presence of RBC populations with marked heterogeneity in size, as a result of anemia and deficient erythropoiesis due to direct and indirect effects of inflammation and oxidative stress, seems to be an attractive hypothesis that can possibly explain the correlation of RDW with disease activity. The international literature contains a rather small number of publications that aimed to investigate RDW as an index of activity in IBD, or its correlation with clinical and laboratory markers used to express active disease (Table 2).

### Association between the red cell distribution width-coefficient of variation with colon cancer and all-cause mortality: insights from the 1999–2018 NHANES [^6add7ba0]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Colon cancer, a type of colorectal cancer (CRC), is a major cause of cancer-related morbidity and mortality worldwide. The etiology of CRC is multifactorial, involving complex interactions between genetic predispositions, lifestyle factors (e.g. diet, physical inactivity, smoking), and socio-demographic variables such as age, sex, and socioeconomic status. These diverse risk factors contribute to significant heterogeneity in disease susceptibility and outcomes, underscoring the need for improved strategies to identify individuals at higher risk within the general population. Early identification of at-risk individuals could enable timely screening and preventive interventions, thereby reducing the overall burden of colon cancer.

Due to the frequently asymptomatic nature of early-stage disease, diagnosis often occurs at advanced stages, resulting in worse clinical outcomes. This is particularly evident in high-risk populations that present diagnostic challenges, such as pregnant women. A large population-based study indicates that although colorectal cancer during pregnancy is rare, its prognosis remains exceedingly poor, with maternal mortality rates reaching 39% and more than half of cases (53%) already classified as stage IV at the time of diagnosis. These statistics underscore the significant challenges in early detection and risk stratification within routine clinical practice, especially for atypical populations. Although population-based screening programs, such as fecal occult blood testing and colonoscopy, have contributed to earlier diagnosis, their uptake remains suboptimal due to barriers such as invasiveness, cost, and limited access, particularly among community-based or underserved populations. Therefore, identifying accessible and cost-effective prognostic biomarkers is essential to improve the overall management of colorectal cancer.

Among potential biomarkers for CRC, red cell distribution width (RDW) and its coefficient of variation (RDW-CV) — routinely measured in complete blood counts — have garnered increasing attention. RDW-CV reflects variability in red blood cell size and is associated with systemic inflammation, oxidative stress, and nutritional status, all of which may contribute to cancer development. Elevated RDW-CV has been linked to advanced tumor stage, poor differentiation, and unfavorable prognosis in CRC patients. However, most previous studies have focused on patients with established CRC, and evidence regarding the association between RDW-CV and incident colon cancer risk or all-cause mortality in community-dwelling populations remains limited. Given the widespread availability and low cost of RDW-CV testing, it holds potential as a tool for early risk stratification in asymptomatic individuals.

### Modulation of red blood cell population dynamics is a fundamental homeostatic response to disease [^031a2a5b]. American Journal of Hematology (2015). Low credibility.

Increased red blood cell (RBC) volume variation (RDW) has recently been shown to predict a wide range of mortality and morbidity: death due to cardiovascular disease, cancer, infection, renal disease, and more; complications in heart failure and coronary artery disease, advanced stage and worse prognosis in many cancers, poor outcomes in autoimmune disease, and many more. The mechanisms by which all of these diseases lead to increased RDW are unknown. Here we use a semi-mechanistic mathematical model of in vivo RBC population dynamics to dissect the factors controlling RDW and show that elevated RDW results largely from a slight reduction in the in vivo rate of RBC turnover. RBCs become smaller as they age, and a slight reduction in the rate of RBC turnover allows smaller cells to continue circulating, expanding the low-volume tail of the RBC population's volume distribution, and thereby increasing RDW. Our results show that mildly extended RBC lifespan is a previously unrecognized homeostatic adaptation common to a very wide range of pathologic states, likely compensating for subtle reductions in erythropoietic output. A mathematical model-based estimate of the clearance rate may provide a novel early-warning biomarker for a wide range of morbidity and mortality.

### Elevated red cell distribution width predicts poor outcome in young patients with community acquired pneumonia [^4ef316b7]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Key messages

- Elevated RDW on admission is a recently described risk factor for adverse outcome in cardiac problems.

- This study demonstrates that elevated RDW in young patients hospitalized with CAP is a significant risk factor for complicated hospitalization and in-hospital mortality.

- Conceivably, measuring RDW in the emergency department might offer the clinician a simple yet powerful tool in the process of decision making whether to admit patients with CAP.

### Association of red blood cell distribution width with mortality risk in hospitalized adults with SARS-CoV-2 infection [^a356c698]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Discussion

In this cohort study, an RDW greater than 14.5% at the time of admission for SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with an increase in mortality risk (from 11% to 31%) in a cohort of 1641 patients treated at a large academic medical center network. Risk of mortality associated with RDW remained statistically significant after adjustment for patient age, race, ethnicity, D-dimer level, absolute lymphocyte count, other blood count measures, and 5 major comorbidities. Patients whose RDW increased during admission also had an increased mortality risk. RDW is routinely measured and may be helpful for prioritizing patients for early, aggressive intervention and managing local hospital resource use.

Patients with elevated RDW at admission were 6.12 times more likely to die within 48 hours (23 of 470 patients [4.9%]) than patients with a normal RDW (9 of 1175 patients [0.8%]). This rapid decompensation is consistent with hospital presentation after substantial disease progression, but timing of disease onset was not available for this cohort. Elevated RDW resulted in a larger increase in mortality risk in younger patients (< 70 years) compared with older patients. This finding may reflect the higher overall mortality rate for older patients, dampening an RDW effect measured in terms of relative risk. A contributing factor may be the lower RDW at admission in the younger age groups (Table 1), which implies that an RDW > 14.5% represents a larger change compared with baseline RDW in these younger patients. It is also possible that an RDW greater than 14.5% is a stronger inflammatory marker in younger patients than in older patients, but studies that are specifically designed to test this hypothesis are required. Race and ethnicity were not statistically significantly associated with an increased mortality risk after adjusting for age and RDW, suggesting that neither race nor ethnicity had implications for patient outcomes after admission. Patients who self-reported Black/African American race or Hispanic ethnicity were overrepresented in the admitted hospital cohort (17% Black/African American and 30% Hispanic) compared with 9% and 12% in a Massachusetts population, consistent with a higher risk of infection in these racial and ethnic groups.

### Red cell distribution width associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease [^40cf517b]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Red cell distribution width (RDW), a coefficient of variation in red blood cell (RBC) volume, is routinely available in reports of complete blood count. RDW is commonly increased because of erythropoiesis deficits or accelerated RBC destruction. RDW increase is often considered as an indicator of anemia caused by iron, cobalamin, or folate deficiency. Recent studies have indicated that patients with higher RDW levels were associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular (CV) events and new-onset stroke. Moreover, the level of RDW was positively correlated with mortality in patients with acute or critical illnesses, in those with chronic diseases, and in healthy cohorts. Patel et al. reported a 14% increased risk of death for each 1% increment in RDW in a community-based elderly population.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and anemia are well-known risk factors for CV events and mortality. RDW significantly increases when CKD progresses from stage 1 to stage 5. According to our review of the relevant literature, few reports have focused on RDW in patients with CKD. Hsieh et al. revealed that RDW was an independent predictor of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and infection mortality in CKD stages 3–5. Inadequate erythropoietin production is the primary feature of anemia in patients with CKD. Anemia reduces oxygen delivery and increases cardiac workload, which exacerbates heart failure and increases the risk of CV events. However, anemia is not the only possible explanation of elevated RDW in patients with CKD. The association of RDW with CV events and mortality was observed to be significant after adjustment for hemoglobin. In this study, we investigated the effect of RDW on major composite CV outcomes during CKD stages 1–5. We hypothesized that elevated RDW is an independent risk factor for CV events and mortality in patients with CKD.

### Predictive role of red blood cell distribution width and hemoglobin-to-red blood cell distribution width ratio for mortality in patients with COPD: evidence from NHANES 1999–2018 [^96a0ce2b]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous disease characterized by persistent and progressive airway inflammation and/or emphysema. This causes airflow limitation, resulting in symptoms like coughing, mucus production, wheezing, and shortness of breath. According to statistics, COPD has become one of the top three causes of death in the world, and many patients have died from it or its complications. In 2019, more than 3.3 million people died from COPD which was the primary cause of deaths from COPD. The global burden of mortality in COPD patients remains substantial, affecting a significant number of individuals worldwide. This disease poses substantial challenges for both patients and healthcare systems, under-scoring the critical need for a comprehensive understanding of the contributing factors to improve outcomes and quality of life for affected individuals.

Red blood cell distribution width (RDW), a simple and inexpensive hematological parameter that reflects the degree of heterogeneity in red blood cell volume, has been traditionally used for the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of anemia. As a dynamic parameter responsive to internal and external stimuli, RDW levels provide a sensitive gauge of the body's homeostatic mechanisms. Clinical studies have shown that RDW is associated with various diseases and disease outcomes, and RDW is now recognized as a strong independent risk factor for mortality in the general population. Over the past 20 years, multiple studies have confirmed that patients with stable COPD and acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive disease (AECOPD) have higher RDW levels compared with healthy individual. Furthermore, some studies have confirmed that RDW is related to mortality in patients with COPD. Hemoglobin-to-red blood cell distribution width ratio (HRR) is a new combined biomarker proposed by Sun et al. in their study on the progression of non-small cell lung cancer. HRR is considered an inflammatory marker and is associated with the incidence and adverse events of a variety of diseases. However, the relationship between HRR and mortality in patients with COPD remains unclear. Furthermore, it is still unclear whether HRR is a better predictor of mortality compared to RDW in these patients.

Consequently, our primary objective is to evaluate the association of RDW and HRR with mortality in COPD patients, and to compare their predictive roles for mortality in these patients.

### Longitudinal changes in red blood cell distribution width decades after radiation exposure in atomic-bomb survivors [^237d2cde]. British Journal of Haematology (2021). Medium credibility.

Red blood cell distribution width (RDW), which generally increases with age, is a risk marker for morbidity and mortality in various diseases. We investigated the association between elevated RDW and prior radiation exposure by examining longitudinal RDW changes in 4204 atomic-bomb survivors over 15 years. A positive association was found between RDW and radiation dose, wherein RDW increased by 0.18%/Gy. This radiation-associated effect increased as the participants aged. Elevated RDW was also associated with higher all-cause mortality. The biological mechanisms underlying these observed associations merit further investigation.

### Association between red blood cell distribution width and mortality and severity among patients with COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^ed4e57d9]. Journal of Medical Virology (2021). Medium credibility.

Emerging evidence has underscored the potential usefulness of red blood cell distribution width (RDW) measurement in predicting the mortality and disease severity of COVID-19. This study aimed to assess the association of the plasma RDW levels with adverse prognosis in COVID-19 patients. A comprehensive literature search from inception to September 2020 was performed to harvest original studies reporting RDW on admission and clinical outcomes among patients hospitalized with COVID-19. RDW levels were compared between cases (patients who died or developed more severe symptoms) and controls (patients who survived or developed less severe symptoms). A total of 14,866 subjects from 10 studies were included in the meta-analysis. Higher levels of RDW were associated with adverse outcomes in COVID-19 patients (mean differences = 0.72; 95% CI = 0.47–0.97; I² = 89.51%). Deceased patients had higher levels of RDW compared to patients who survived (mean differences = 0.93; 95% CI = 0.63–1.23; I² = 85.58%). Severely ill COVID-19 patients showed higher levels of RDW, as opposed to patients classified to have milder symptoms (mean differences = 0.61; 95% CI = 0.28–0.94; I² = 82.18%). Elevated RDW levels were associated with adverse outcomes in COVID-19 patients. This finding warrants further research on whether RDW could be utilized as a simple and reliable biomarker for predicting COVID-19 severity and whether RDW is mechanistically linked with COVID-19 pathophysiology.

### Red cell distribution width improves the simplified acute physiology score for risk prediction in unselected critically ill patients [^cfd2081a]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Recently, red cell distribution width (RDW), a measure of erythrocyte size variability, has been shown to be a prognostic marker in critical illness. The aim of this study was to investigate whether adding RDW has the potential to improve the prognostic performance of the simplified acute physiology score (SAPS) to predict short- and long-term mortality in an independent, large, and unselected population of intensive care unit (ICU) patients.

Methods

This observational cohort study includes 17,922 ICU patients with available RDW measurements from different types of ICUs. We modeled the association between RDW and mortality by using multivariable logistic regression, adjusting for demographic factors, comorbidities, hematocrit, and severity of illness by using the SAPS.

Results

ICU-, in-hospital-, and 1-year mortality rates in the 17,922 included patients were 7.6% (95% CI, 7.2 to 8.0), 11.2% (95% CI, 10.8 to 11.7), and 25.4% (95% CI, 24.8 to 26.1). RDW was significantly associated with in-hospital mortality (OR per 1% increase in RDW (95%CI)) (1.14 (1.08 to 1.19), P < 0.0001), ICU mortality (1.10 (1.06 to 1.15), P < 0.0001), and 1-year mortality (1.20 (95% CI, 1.14 to 1.26); P < 0.001). Adding RDW to SAPS significantly improved the AUC from 0.746 to 0.774 (P < 0.001) for in-hospital mortality and 0.793 to 0.805 (P < 0.001) for ICU mortality. Significant improvements in classification of SAPS were confirmed in reclassification analyses. Subgroups demonstrated robust results for gender, age categories, SAPS categories, anemia, hematocrit categories, and renal failure.

Conclusions

RDW is a promising independent short- and long-term prognostic marker in ICU patients and significantly improves risk stratification of SAPS. Further research is needed the better to understand the pathophysiology underlying these effects.

### Red cell distribution width, haemoglobin A1c and incidence of diabetes mellitus [^1cb4beed]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Hyperglycaemia has multiple effects on the red blood cell (RBC), including glycation of haemoglobin, reduced deformability and reduced lifespan. Red cell distribution width (RDW) is a measure of the heterogeneity of erythrocyte volumes. The aim of this study was to explore the relationships between RDW and glucose, haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and incidence of diabetes mellitus (DM).

Design, Setting and Subjects

RDW and mean corpuscular volume were measured in 26 709 non-diabetic participants (aged 45–73 years) from the population-based Malmö Diet and Cancer cohort. HbA1c and fasting venous blood glucose levels were measured in 4845 subjects.

Main Outcome Measure

Incidence of DM (n = 2944) over 14 years of follow-up was studied by linkage with national and local DM registers.

Results

Individuals with low RDW had significantly higher risk of developing DM [adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 1.48, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.29–1.70, for 1st vs. 4th quartile], especially in subjects with impaired fasting glucose (n = 416) (HR 2.15, 95% CI 1.12–4.14). Low RDW was also associated with significantly higher waist circumference and glucose, insulin and triglyceride concentrations. By contrast, RDW was significantly and positively associated with HbA1c, corresponding an increase in HbA1c of 0.10% per 1 SD increase in RDW.

Conclusion

Low RDW is associated with increased incidence of DM independently of other risk factors. We propose that low RDW could be a surrogate marker of reduced RBC survival, with lower HbA1c due to shorter duration of glucose exposure. RDW is a biomarker that could improve risk assessment for individuals at risk of developing DM.

### Relation between red blood cell distribution width and cardiovascular event rate in people with coronary disease [^f036f232]. Circulation (2008). Low credibility.

BACKGROUND: Higher levels of red blood cell distribution width (RDW) may be associated with adverse outcomes in patients with heart failure. We examined the association between RDW and the risk of all-cause mortality and adverse cardiovascular outcomes in a population of people with coronary disease who were free of heart failure at baseline. METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed a post hoc analysis of data from the Cholesterol and Recurrent Events study. Baseline RDW was measured in 4111 participants who were randomized to receive pravastatin 40 mg daily or placebo and followed for a median of 59.7 months. We used Cox proportional hazards models to examine the association between RDW and adverse clinical outcomes. During nearly 60 months of follow-up, 376 participants died. A significant association was noted between baseline RDW level and the adjusted risk of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio per percent increase in RDW, 1.14; 95% confidence interval, 1.05 to 1.24). After categorization based on quartile of baseline RDW and further adjustment for hematocrit and other cardiovascular risk factors, a graded independent relation between RDW and death was observed (P for trend = 0.001). For instance, participants with RDW in the highest quartile had an adjusted hazard ratio for death of 1.78 (95% confidence interval, 1.28 to 2.47) compared with those in the lowest quartile. Higher levels of RDW were also associated with increased risk of coronary death/nonfatal myocardial infarction, new symptomatic heart failure, and stroke. CONCLUSIONS: We found a graded independent relation between higher levels of RDW and the risk of death and cardiovascular events in people with prior myocardial infarction but no symptomatic heart failure at baseline.

### Red cell distribution width is associated with hemoglobin A1c elevation, but not glucose elevation [^ee893d3e]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2017). Low credibility.

Aims

To investigate the association between red cell distribution width (RDW) and elevation of glucose/glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c).

Methods

An analysis was conducted using data from a prospective cohort study of adults. People without prediabetes or diabetes (n = 7,795) were followed for a mean of 2.90years (range: 1-7years, 95% confidence interval: 2.86–2.94years). Glucose elevation is defined as fasting glucose levels exceeding 5.6mmol/l, or 2-hour glucose values in the oral glucose tolerance test exceeding 7.8mmol/l. HbA1c elevation is defined as a HbA1c value exceeding a normal limit of 39mmol/mol (5.7%). Adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to assess the association between RDW quartiles and elevation of HbA1c/glucose.

Results

The multiple-adjusted hazard ratios (95% confidence interval) of HbA1c elevation for increased quartiles of RDW were 1.00 (reference), 1.08 (0.89, 1.30), 1.28 (1.07, 1.54), and 1.54 (1.29, 1.85) (P for trend < 0.0001). However, no significant association was observed between RDW and blood glucose (fasting and postprandial).

Conclusions

Elevated RDW is independently related to future HbA1c elevation, but not to glucose elevation. This suggests that RDW may associate with HbA1c through a non-glycemic way, which should be taken into consideration when using HbA1c as a diagnostic criterion of prediabetes or diabetes.

### Ratio of red blood cell distribution width to albumin level and risk of mortality [^60fa2984]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

The identification of new biomarkers for the early detection of increased risk of mortality remains an unmet need. There has been significant progress in establishing the epidemiology of novel blood biomarkers for all-cause and cause-specific mortality, such as serum neurofilament light chain, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide, retinol, alpha tocopherol, and beta carotene. Despite this progress, simple, inexpensive, and reliable indicators are still essential for predicting mortality in clinical practice. At present, routine laboratory tests are widely used in primary care and hospitals, and further use of routine clinical biomarkers is expected. For example, several new biomarkers, such as the prognostic nutritional index, ratio of neutrophil to lymphocyte, and ratio of platelet to lymphocyte, were derived from routine laboratory tests. These simple integrated biomarkers showed significant associations with all-cause and cause-specific mortality in the general population. Therefore, there is still substantial interest in the use of routine biomarkers to identify persons who are at risk for mortality.

Red blood cell distribution width (RDW), a marker from routine laboratory tests, reflects the degree of heterogeneity in erythrocyte volume. Increased RDW, resulting from impaired erythropoiesis and abnormal red blood cell survival, are associated with a variety of disorders and mortality. Serum albumin, the most abundant circulating protein in the blood, is an important marker of nutritional status and the inflammatory response. The physiological properties of albumin include anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anticoagulant, and antiplatelet aggregation activities as well as colloid osmotic effects. Several studies have reported that the serum albumin concentration is inversely associated with the incidence of dysfunction, disease, and mortality. Additionally, RDW is positively correlated with chronological age, while serum albumin is negatively correlated with chronological age, and RDW and albumin are associated with phenotypic and biological age and contribute greatly to individual variances in aging pace.

### Red cell distribution width as a marker of activity in inflammatory bowel disease: a narrative review [^0ccdc8a5]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Red cell distribution width (RDW) is an automatic expression of hematologic analyzers reflecting the size variability of circulating red blood cells (RBC). It is a marker used together with other laboratory parameters to determine and narrow the cause of anemia and it has shown promising potential as an index of disease activity and severity in various pathologic conditions.

The diagnosis and follow up of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are based on a combination of clinical indices, laboratory markers, endoscopy, histology and imaging modalities. However, these have various disadvantages, such as low sensitivity and specificity, high cost, limited availability, absence of simplicity, invasiveness, and lack of reproducibility.

The demand for an index used to recognize and monitor disease activity in IBD that overcomes these disadvantages still remains unmet. Since RDW expresses a lot of attractive characteristics, a number of clinical studies have been performed to evaluate its application as a surrogate marker of disease activity in IBD. We searched MEDLINE and the Cochrane Library through December 2019. Search terms included "red cell distribution width", "Inflammatory bowel disease", "Crohn's Disease" and "Ulcerative Colitis", and we critically reviewed all relevant articles published in English. The intention of this review is to summarize the current state of knowledge on the utility of RDW as a marker of activity in IBD.

### Association of red blood cell distribution width with mortality risk in hospitalized adults with SARS-CoV-2 infection [^9d25ca1e]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Other studies have noted the potential value of using RDW for a differential diagnosis of pneumonia, or as a marker of complication rates in SARS-CoV-2 infection, either directly or as a component of a machine learning framework. Recent small-scale studies have included RDW in multivariate models along with neutrophil-lymphocyte ratioor hemoglobinfor a differential diagnosis of COVID-19. The results of the present study show that the use of RDW as a univariate marker relative to its predetermined reference interval (≤ 14.5%) is associated with substantially increased mortality risk. We also found that RDW was associated with the highest risk ratio when considered in multivariate models with some other blood count measures (eTable 4 in the Supplement). The only other blood count measure studied with a statistically significant risk ratio was PLT count, and future investigation is warranted given the evidence of thrombotic complications within COVID-19 patients.

The specific mechanism or mechanisms for the RDW alteration associated with COVID-19 remain unclear. RDW is a nonspecific marker of general illness, and is therefore unlikely to be causally associated with COVID-19 disease progression. COVID-19 is associated with altered turnover in all WBC lineages, as noted previously, as well as with altered platelet dynamics in COVID-associated coagulopathy. The association of elevated RDW with COVID-19 severity could be consistent with previous reports (in non–COVID-19 cohorts), suggesting that RDW can become elevated when RBC production kinetics have slowed in the setting of increased WBC and platelet kinetics.

It is unknown whether patients admitted with an RDW greater than 14.5% had higher baseline RDW than those who were admitted with an RDW of 14.5% or less before SARS-CoV-2 infection. RDW usually changes slowly because it reflects the volume variance of a cell population that is turning over at a rate typically no larger than a 1% or 2% per day. The large increase in the elevated RDW group (> 3% shown in Figure 3 A) may suggest a longer duration of disease for these patients at the time of admission, but direct study of the earlier phases of the disease is required to know how quickly RDW may be evolving before hospitalization, and determination of time of initial infection was not possible within this study cohort.

### Ratio of red blood cell distribution width to albumin level and risk of mortality [^456d4cf1]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is the ratio of red blood cell distribution width to albumin concentration (RAR) associated with mortality in the general population?

Findings

In this cohort study involving 469 572 participants at baseline and 44 383 deaths during follow-up periods, higher RAR levels were associated with increased risks of all-cause and cause-specific mortality.

Meaning

These findings suggest that the RAR, assessed via routine laboratory tests, could be a promising indicator that is simple, reliable, and inexpensive for identifying individuals at high risk of mortality in clinical practice.

### Red blood cell distribution width to albumin ratio (RAR) is associated with low cognitive performance in American older adults: NHANES 2011–2014 [^78dbb02b]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

The specific biological mechanisms about association between higher RAR and increased risk of low cognitive performance have not yet been fully elucidated, but may be related to chronic inflammation and poor nutritional status. RAR is a composite indicator integrating RDW and albumin, with increases in RDW and decreases in albumin both contributing to elevated RAR levels. Several studies have indicated that elevated RDW is associated with cognitive decline. A cross-sectional study indicated a "J-shaped" relationship between elevated RDW levels and the likelihood of dementia in older adults. Additionally, a prospective cohort study highlighted a causal impact of RDW on the risk of Alzheimer's disease. Elevated RDW is commonly associated with systemic inflammatory states, which can affect erythropoiesis, red blood cell lifespan, and red blood cell deformability, leading to increased cell anisotropy and subsequently raising RDW levels. Chronic inflammation is considered one of the key mechanisms underlying low cognitive performance. Abnormal deposition of amyloid proteins can lead to excessive activation of microglia and astrocytes in the central nervous system, triggering neuroinflammatory responses. Prolonged inflammatory conditions result in structural and functional damage to neurons, further contributing to cognitive decline. Additionally, RDW is used in the differential diagnosis of anemia, which is considered a contributing factor to CI and Alzheimer's disease. In the condition of anemia, pathological changes in red blood cells, including alterations in quantity, volume, distribution, and overall mass, can reduce the blood's oxygen-carrying capacity. Hypoxic changes in cerebral blood vessels may be a crucial mechanism in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, leading to low cognitive performance and dementia. Our study also found that participants with higher RAR often had lower hemoglobin levels and a higher risk of low cognitive performance.

### Red cell distribution width in alcohol abuse and iron deficiency anemia-reply… [^e9a35a57]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

In Reply. — Dr Seppä and Mr Sillanaukee suggest that high RDW and normal MCV may herald early alcohol abuse. It is true that liver disease has been described as a common cause of isolated increased RDW. 1, 2 The challenge would now be to distinguish alcohol abuse per se from the liver disease that commonly results from alcohol abuse. Another point to note is that both early pernicious anemia and alcohol abuse-liver disease tend to be associated with high normal MCV, unlike early iron deficiency, which is associated with lownormal MCV. 1 As in many other analyses with broad normal ranges, different parts of "normal" mean different things. We would concur that a high-normal MCV and high RDW suggest liver disease — alcohol abuse, early megaloblastic deficiency, and/or cytotoxic chemotherapy. As shown in our data, early iron deficiency with a normal MCV is predominantly found in the lower half. Bessman JD, McClure S.

### Red blood cell distribution width and ischaemic stroke [^8351bcac]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

The red blood cell distribution width (RDW) is a parameter that reflects the heterogeneity of the red blood cell volume. It is indicated that the variation coefficient of the red blood cell volume is more objective and accurate than that of the red blood cell on the blood smear. RDW is in about 11.0%–16.0% in normal population. RDW will rise under some physiological and pathological conditions.

RDW has at least five clinical significant meanings:
To diagnose and guide the treatment of iron deficiency anaemia. Traditionally, anaemia deficiency from iron can be differentiated from folate deficiency according to the size of RDW. RDW would increase because of the release of immature red blood cells into the blood stream in certain haematological diseases.RDW increases in iron deficiency anaemia, and such increase would appear earlier than the decline of mean corpuscular volume (MCV), which can be an early indication of iron deficiency. When MCV is low, RDW would increase more significantly. When iron therapy is given, RDW would elevate first and then gradually reduce at the normal level.
To diagnose small cell and low pigment anaemia.
To classify anaemia.
Previously, many research suggested that RDW was closely related to the mortality and cardiovascular events, such as acute coronary syndrome, ischaemic cerebrovascular disease, peripheral artery disease, heart failure (HF), atrial fibrillation (AF) and hypertension.
RDW can be made as a predictor of mortality in patients with cancer, chronic lung disease or acute renal failure.

Stroke is the result of cerebral vascular occlusion or haemorrhage, and it is the leading cause of death in the world. At present, clinical diagnosis relies on history, neurological examinations and neuro-imaging. Several scoring systems are used to quantify the degree of severity of stroke: the Glasgow Coma Scale, Canadian Neurological Scale, Scandinavian Stroke Scale and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS). However, there is no biological surrogate marker to diagnose stroke. RDW by flow cytometry could be an option for this purpose and predict the occurrence of stroke.

### Predictive role of red blood cell distribution width and hemoglobin-to-red blood cell distribution width ratio for mortality in patients with COPD: evidence from NHANES 1999–2018 [^99068b89]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

At present, the specific mechanism underlying the association between RDW, HRR, and mortality remains unclear. As far as we know, the underlying mechanism mainly includes the following aspects: Firstly, research showed that high RDW levels are associated with oxidative stress and inflammatory status. Oxidative stress exerts a significant impact on erythrocyte homeostasis and survival. Consequently, it is plausible that oxidative stress serves as an additional underlying biological mechanism contributing to the elevation of RDW, possibly by accelerating red cell turnover. This, in turn, contributes to the association between anisocytosis and pathological conditions in humans. Inflammation has the potential to influence iron metabolism and bone marrow function, thereby impeding the maturation of erythrocytes induced by erythropoietin. As a result, immature red blood cells are released into circulation, disrupting the clearance process and leading to an increase in RDW. Secondly, elevated RDW is associated with various comorbidities in patients with COPD, such as right ventricular dysfunction, pulmonary hypertension, and CVD. The presence of these comorbidities also contributes to an increased risk of mortality in patients with COPD. Other mechanisms that may contribute to increased mortality include hypoxemia, poor nutritional status, and association with exacerbations of COPD. Furthermore, studies have confirmed that hemoglobin levels are associated with the prognosis of patients with COPD, and anemia is associated with adverse outcomes in these patients. Low hemoglobin levels serve as crucial indicators of inflammation processes. HRR is a combined index calculated from hemoglobin and RDW. Therefore, HRR can also reflect the association between these two indicators and COPD. Naturally, additional studies will be required to validate these findings in the future.

### Red cell distribution width is associated with incident myocardial infarction in a general population: the troms ø study [^7471cd98]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Red cell distribution width (RDW), a measure of the variability in size of circulating erythrocytes, is calculated by automated blood cell counters as part of the routine blood cell count analysis. Traditionally, RDW and mean corpuscular volume (MCV) are used in the differential diagnosis of anemia, particularly anemias that are microcytic (caused by iron deficiency) or macrocytic (due to vitamin B 12 or folate deficiency). An increased RDW can also result from conditions that modify the shape of red blood cells due to the premature release of immature cells into the bloodstream, to hemoglobinopathies, or to other hematological diseases.

Myocardial infarction (MI) remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. – Consequently, identification of novel risk factors is of great potential value to improve risk stratification and facilitate targeted prevention of MI. In a study from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), a representative US population, participants with RDW values above the 75th percentile were aggregated in the highest 10‐year Framingham risk category for coronary heart disease. Other observational studies in selected cohorts of patients with heart disease have reported that RDW predicts all‐cause mortality, – cardiac morbidity and mortality, – and adverse outcome in patients with heart failure. – Furthermore, RDW predicted all‐cause mortality and cardiovascular (CV) mortality in 2 population‐based studies from NHANES. –

The association between RDW and MI has previously been reported mainly in patients with known CV disease or heart failure. – Although growing evidence supports the hypothesis that high RDW is associated with an unfavorable CV risk profile and higher total and CV mortality in various populations, the impact of RDW on the risk of incident MI in a general population is unclear. Consequently, we aimed to investigate whether RDW was associated with risk of first‐ever event of MI in a large prospective study with participants recruited from a general population.

### An increase in red blood cell distribution width from baseline predicts mortality in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock [^3335fa2b]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Interestingly, in multivariate analysis for 90-day mortality, a significantly higher mortality risk was observed in group 3 in which RDW increased within 72 hours after ED admission (normal RDW at baseline and ΔRDW 72hr-adm > 0.2%) compared to group 1, while there was an insignificant difference between group 1 and 3 in 28-day mortality. These findings demonstrate that the relationship between an increase in RDW and mortality may be more meaningful, when the follow-up duration is longer.

Although the mechanism underlying the association between higher RDW and mortality in septic patients is not yet completely understood, several plausible explanations have been suggested in previous studies. Systemic inflammation has been shown to predict progressive illness, cardiovascular mortality and death in ICU patients. Systemic inflammation response impacts bone marrow function and iron metabolism, and proinflammatory cytokines have been found to inhibit erythropoietin-induced erythrocyte maturation and proliferation, and to downregulate erythropoietin receptor expression, which are associated with RDW increases. Oxidative stress may also be a contributing factor of the association between RDW and mortality. High oxidative stress is present in sepsis through the generation of reactive oxygen species by activated leukocytes. Moreover, it has been proposed that oxidative stress induces an increase in RDW by reducing RBC survival and increasing the release of large premature RBCs into the peripheral circulation. Another explanation may be related to malnutrition. Nutritional markers, including total cholesterol and albumin, are believed to be significantly associated with RDW. In addition, RDW has also been noted to be associated with renal dysfunction, which is known to be closely related with inflammation and malnutrition. Recently, Veeranna et al. demonstrated the predictive ability of RDW for HbA1c in healthy nondiabetic adults, proposing the possibility of chronic hyperglycemia along with oxidative stress and inflammation as mediators of the association between RDW and adverse outcomes. All things considered, it is reasonable to assume that increased RDW may represent an integrative measure of the multiple harmful pathologic processes, including inflammation, oxidative stress, malnutrition, and renal dysfunction, that simultaneously occur in critical illness. Thus, with respect to the results of this study, we suggest that changes in RDW, especially increasing RDW, reflect the aggravation of inflammation, oxidative stress, nutritional deficiencies, and renal dysfunction, and that the combination of a baseline RDW value and an increase in RDW can be a promising independent prognostic marker in septic patients. However, inflammation, oxidative stress, nutritional deficiencies, and renal dysfunction may not entirely explain why increased RDW is associated with mortality and greater length of hospital stay, because these associations were still significant even after adjusting for total cholesterol, albumin, and SOFA score; therefore further study is needed to determine the mechanism for the association between RDW values and mortality.

### Association of red blood cell distribution width with short-and long-term all-cause mortality in patients with acute pancreatitis and sepsis [^5654061c]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a common gastrointestinal emergency with a rising global incidence. Epidemiological studies estimate the annual incidence of AP to range from approximately 13 to 135 cases per 100,000 population, depending on regional variations. Globally, the incidence has been increasing at an average annual rate of 3.07%. The most common etiological factors include gallstones, alcohol consumption, hyperlipidemia, and certain medications, such as rifampicin, diuretics, and immunosuppressive agents. Clinically, AP is typically characterized by persistent, radiating abdominal pain, often accompanied by nausea and vomiting. The pathophysiology of AP is complicated, and it is often associated with the activation of gastrointestinal enzymes, kinin system, pancreas damage, and inflammation. While mild cases of AP generally have a favorable prognosis, severe cases — particularly those complicated by sepsis, organ failure, or pancreatic necrosis — are associated with high morbidity and a mortality rate of up to 20%. This systemic involvement creates an environment characterized by oxidative stress, inflammatory cytokine release, and impaired microcirculation — all of which can influence hematological parameters. One such parameter is red blood cell distribution width (RDW), a routinely available measure that reflects the variability in red blood cell size.

RDW has been associated with a wide range of clinical conditions. Elevated RDW levels are commonly observed in patients with conditions such as megaloblastic anemia and aplastic anemia. As a key hematological parameter, RDW plays a crucial role in assessing changes in red blood cell volume, thereby aiding clinicians in the classification and diagnosis of different types of anemia. Moreover, elevated RDW has been linked to increased risks of cardiovascular, hepatic, and renal diseases. Increased RDW has also been shown to be related to inflammation. Previous studies have suggested that RDW may be associated with the prognosis of sepsis. He et al. showed that RDW is a risk factor in patients with AP, but this study did not address the impact of concurrent sepsis — a common and often fatal complication of severe AP.

Given the high mortality associated with AP and sepsis, and the potential of RDW as an accessible and cost-effective prognostic biomarker, it is essential to investigate its predictive value in this specific population. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate whether RDW is independently associated with short-term and long-term all-cause mortality in patients with AP and sepsis.

### Red cell distribution width associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease [^738fa0b1]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Recent studies have demonstrated that red cell distribution width (RDW) is associated with cardiovascular (CV) events and mortality. Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are often anemic and have high RDW levels. In this study, we investigated the effect of RDW on major composite CV outcomes among patients with CKD.

Methods

We retrospectively analyzed patients with CKD who were admitted to the department of cardiology of a tertiary hospital in 2011. The patients were divided into 2 groups: normal RDW (RDW < 14.5%) and elevated RDW (RDW ≥ 14.5%). Demographic characteristics, comorbidities, blood investigation results, prescriptions, and outcomes were analyzed after a 3-year follow-up period. Six adjustment levels were performed to evaluate the effect of RDW on outcomes.

Results

This study involved 282 patients with CKD: 213 in the elevated RDW group and 69 in the normal RDW group. The elevated RDW group had older patients, a lower proportion of male patients, lower left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) values, lower hemoglobin levels, lower serum albumin levels, and higher creatinine levels, compared with the normal RDW group. A linear trend was observed toward higher RDW in patients with deteriorating renal function. In the final adjusted model, RDW ≥ 14.5%, older age, and lower LVEF were associated with an increased risk of major composite CV outcomes.

Conclusion

RDW is a potentially useful cost-effective indicator of major composite CV outcomes in patients with CKD.

### Red cell distribution width and dementia among rural-dwelling older adults: the MIND-China study [^084c709f]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2021). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Dementia affects over 50 million people worldwide, and nearly 60%of all dementia patients live in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Notably, the number of people with dementia is projected to increase faster in LMICs than in high-income countries in the coming decades. Since the 1990s the prevalence of dementia in China has increased steadily in all age groups from 60 years of age. The total annual expenditure for dementia in China was estimated at US$168 billion. The prevalence of dementia was notably higher in the rural than urban communities. Given that there is currently no curative therapy available for dementia, identifying modifiable risk factors is crucial for preventive and therapeutic interventions to delay the onset of dementia and slow cognitive decline.

The red blood cell distribution width (RDW) is a simple parameter that reflects the heterogeneity of circulating erythrocyte volume. It is routinely calculated by the overwhelming majority of hematologic analyzers according to red blood cell (RBC) volume and mean corpuscular volume (MCV). A normal RDW suggests homogeneous RBC size, whereas an elevated RDW indicates heterogeneous RBC size, known as anisocytosis. RDW in combination with MCV can used for differential diagnosis of anemia. An elevated RDW is often related to anemia due to nutrient deficiency (e.g. iron, vitamin B12, and folic acid) and sideroblastic anemia, and a normal RDW is often related to anemia from chronic disease, thalassemia heterozygosity, and aplastic anemia. Studies have shown that an increased RDW is associated with mortality, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, stroke, and other chronic health conditions. The association of RDW with adverse health outcomes may depend on anemia or hemoglobin levels. Of note, the cross-sectional data from the Chicago Health and Aging Project found that elevated RDW was associated with dementia, especially among non-anemic participants. In addition, evidence has been accumulating over the last decade that anemia or low hemoglobin is related to cognitive impairment and dementia among older adults. However, most population-based studies of anemia and dementia have been conducted among high-income countries. In particular, the relationship of abnormal RDW with dementia and cognitive function as well as the interplay of increased RDW and anemia in cognitive aging has yet to be explored among LMICs.

Therefore, in this population-based cross-sectional study of older adults living in the rural communities in China, we sought 1) to evaluate the associations of RDW and anemia with dementia and global cognitive function; and 2) to explore whether their association varied by anemia status.

### Red cell distribution width is associated with incident myocardial infarction in a general population: the troms ø study [^4c136d97]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency in itself is also a common cause of high RDW. In 1981, Sullivan proposed that iron deficiency could protect against MI. Some later studies supported this hypothesis, whereas others did not find any relationship or even an inverse relationship between iron deficiency and MI. Iron deficiency without anemia has been shown to affect health issues – and may specifically attenuate iron‐dependent scavenger functions of oxidative stress that may promote inflammation. Consequently, the impact of iron status on RDW and subsequent MI should be investigated in future studies.

It has been reported that increased CV mortality by RDW is confined to those with anemia. To explore the impact of anemia on the relationship between RDW and risk of MI in our study, we included hemoglobin in our multivariable model and performed analyses in which anemic participants were excluded. The risk estimates for MI by RDW in our study were not affected by adjustment for hemoglobin or by excluding participants with anemia. This demonstrates that anemia does not explain the strong association between RDW and MI. Furthermore, results from an elderly outpatient cohort implied that the association between extremely high RDW (> 16.6%) and mortality was particularly strong in those with nonanemic macrocytosis (MCV > 96 fL) or microcytosis (MCV < 80 fL). We found no association between RDW and risk of MI in nonanemic participants with macrocytosis (893 participants with 85 MI events) or microcytosis (254 participants with 14 events).

Alternatively, RDW may exert a more direct effect in the pathway toward MI. The erythrocytes contain large amounts of free cholesterol, and pathological changes in the erythrocyte membrane may potentially lead to accumulation of erythrocytes within the atheromatous plaque. The erythrocyte membrane promotes atherosclerosis by deposition of free cholesterol to atherosclerotic plaques, thereby providing lipid rich membranes to foam cell formation, and by propagation of the inflammatory cascade. – Accumulation of erythrocytes promotes plaque instability.– The concept is supported by higher levels of total cholesterol in the erythrocyte membrane from patients presenting with acute coronary syndrome compared with patients with chronic stable anginaand a positive association between cholesterol content of erythrocyte membranes and RDW values in patients with coronary disease. An association between the total cholesterol content of the erythrocyte membrane and the severity of coronary artery disease has also been reported. The mechanisms whereby RDW could influence development of atherosclerosis remain unsettled.

### Red cell distribution width is associated with cardiovascular risk and disease parameters in rheumatoid arthritis [^95be10d3]. Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Since red cell distribution width (RDW) has been associated with cardiovascular (CV) disease and inflammation in several conditions, the main aim of this study was to evaluate its prognostic value in RA patients and its potential associations with clinical features.

Methods

The history of CV events was retrospectively reviewed in 160 RA patients and RDW was recorded at disease onset and 6 and 12 months after diagnosis to calculate the accumulated value [area under the curve (AUC) RDW] and change during the first year (ΔRDW). In addition, RDW was analysed in 110 patients with established disease in relation to clinical features.

Results

Increased RDW at diagnosis and AUC RDW were able to predict the occurrence of CV events in RA patients [hazard ratio (HR) 1.247 (95% CI 1.079, 1.441), P = 0.003 and HR 1.038 (95% CI 1.018, 1.059), P = 0.0001, respectively] after adjusting by potential confounding factors. Receiver operating characteristic curve analyses revealed a better power of discrimination for the AUC RDW (P = 3.394 × 10⁻⁵). In addition, an increase in RDW during the first year was associated with poor CV outcome (P = 0.010). On the other hand, RDW in patients with established RA was significantly associated with disease activity, acute phase reactants and severity.

Conclusion

RDW at disease onset may be used as an early marker of CV risk in RA, whereas in patients with established disease it was related to the activity of the disease. These findings suggest that RDW can be considered as a surrogate marker of inflammation and, consequently, CV risk in RA patients.

### Multiplicative interaction between mean corpuscular volume and red cell distribution width in predicting mortality of elderly patients with and without anemia [^f04b9eab]. American Journal of Hematology (2013). Low credibility.

Recent studies have shown that an elevated red cell distribution width (RDW) is an important predictor of adverse outcomes. However, the strength of this biomarker has not been tested in a large outpatient elderly population. Also since increased RDW can be due to a variety of etiologies, additional biomarkers are needed to refine the prognostic value of this variable. We assembled a cohort of 36,226 elderly (≥ 65yo) patients seen at an outpatient facility within the Einstein/Montefiore system from January 1st 1997 to May 1st 2008 who also had a complete blood count performed within 3 months of the initial visit. With a maximum follow-up of 10 years, we found that an elevated RDW (> 16.6) was associated with increased risk of mortality in both non-anemic (HR = 3.66, p < 0.05) and anemic patients (HR = 1.87, p < 0.05). The effect of RDW on mortality is significantly increased in non-anemic patients with macrocytosis (HR = 5.22, p < 0.05) compared to those with normocytosis (HR = 3.86, p < 0.05) and microcytosis (HR = 2.46, p < 0.05). When comparing non-anemic patients with both an elevated RDW and macrocytosis to those with neither, we observed an elevated HR of 7.76 (higher than expected in an additive model). This multiplicative interaction was not observed in anemic patients (HR = 2.23). Lastly, we constructed Kaplan-Meier curves for each RDW/MCV subgroup and found worsened survival for those with macrocytosis and an elevated RDW in both anemia and non-anemic patients. Based on our results, the addition of MCV appears to improve the prognostic value of RDW as a predictor of overall survival in elderly patients.

### Elevated red cell distribution width predicts poor outcome in young patients with community acquired pneumonia [^0d38493f]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

The association of RDW and complicated hospitalization

Ninety five (55.6%) patients with complicated hospitalization had increased RDW as compared with 123 (26%) patients with uncomplicated admissions (P < 0.0001).

Complicated hospitalization and mortality rates were significantly higher among patients with increased RDW regardless of the WBC count (Figure 1); the complicated hospitalization rate was 15.7% in patients with normal RDW and WBC and 20.3% in patients with only abnormal WBC count, as compared with 33.3% in patients with elevated RDW alone (P = 0.001) and 51.2% in patients with combined abnormal leukocyte count and increased RDW (P < 0.001). As shown in Figure 1, the 90-day mortality was higher in patients with elevated RDW regardless of the WBC count; however, once again the combination of abnormal WBC and elevated RDW was significantly associated with the highest mortality rates.

In order to rule out the possibility that RDW effect on severe morbidity and mortality was unrelated to anemia, we compared complicated hospitalization in patients with hemoglobin (Hb) levels less than 110 g/L and higher levels of Hb. The two groups were examined in patients with normal and elevated RDW. As depicted in Figure 2, patients with normal RDW had no difference in severe morbidity or mortality regardless of Hb levels. On the other hand, elevated RDW was associated with a significant increase in both complicated hospitalization and 90-day mortality rates irrespective of Hb levels.

### Elevated red cell distribution width predicts poor outcome in young patients with community acquired pneumonia [^2c97746a]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Several explanations were suggested to this surprising finding. Abnormal RDW usually suggests one or more chronic condition that accompanies significant heart failure, such as anemia or nutritional deficit. Another mechanism that was suggested is the release of cytokines in response to inflammatory stress. These cytokines block the activity of erythropoietin and cause production of ineffective red blood cell and elevated RDW. Lippi et al found a correlation between high RDW and elevated indexes of inflammation, such as elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP). This correlation was independent of concomitant diseases, and was demonstrated even when anemic patients were excluded from the statistical analysis.

Our data demonstrated that RDW is a valuable and sensitive marker for a high level of inflammatory activity in young patients with CAP, and it is independent of hemoglobin levels. The mechanism underlying the association between high levels of RDW and adverse outcome in patients hospitalized with pneumonia is unknown. RDW is elevated in conditions in which there is ineffective red cell production or increased destruction of red blood cell. RDW may indicate a severe inflammatory process, with impact on bone marrow function and iron metabolism. Another option is that RDW is an earlier marker of prognosis, and it may appear earlier in the complex process of anemia than low levels of hemoglobin. As noted before, high RDW levels may represent a culmination of multiple pathophysiologic processes occurring in acute inflammatory and infectious state.

### Red cell distribution width is associated with incident myocardial infarction in a general population: the troms ø study [^878d849c]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Red cell distribution width (RDW), a measure of the variability in size of circulating erythrocytes, is associated with mortality and adverse outcome in selected populations with cardiovascular disease. It is scarcely known whether RDW is associated with incident myocardial infarction (MI). We aimed to investigate whether RDW was associated with risk of first‐ever MI in a large cohort study with participants recruited from a general population.

Methods and Results

Baseline characteristics, including RDW, were collected for 25 612 participants in the Tromsø Study in 1994–1995. Incident MI during follow‐up was registered from inclusion through December 31, 2010. Cox regression models were used to calculate hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals for MI, adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, smoking, hemoglobin, white blood cells, platelets, and other traditional cardiovascular risk factors. A total of 1779 participants experienced a first‐ever MI during a median follow‐up time of 15.8 years. There was a linear association between RDW and risk of MI, for which a 1% increment in RDW was associated with a 13% increased risk (hazard ratio 1.13; 95% CI, 1.07 to 1.19). Participants with RDW above the 95th percentile had 71% higher risk of MI compared with those with RDW in the lowest quintile (hazard ratio 1.71; 95% CI, 1.34 to 2.20). All effect estimates were essentially similar after exclusion of participants with anemia (n = 1297) from the analyses.

Conclusion

RDW is associated with incident MI in a general population independent of anemia and cardiovascular risk factors.

### An increase in red blood cell distribution width from baseline predicts mortality in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock [^4b4c540e]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

A potential independent association was recently demonstrated between high red blood cell distribution width (RDW) and the risk of all-cause mortality in critically ill patients, although the mechanism underlying this relationship remains unclear. Little is known about the impact changes in RDW may have on survival in critically ill patients. Therefore, we investigated the prognostic significance of changes in RDW during hospital stay in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock.

Methods

We prospectively enrolled 329 patients who were admitted to the emergency department (ED) and received a standardized resuscitation algorithm (early-goal directed therapy) for severe sepsis or septic shock. The relationship between the changes in RDW during the first 72 hours after ED admission and all-cause mortality (28-day and 90-day) were analyzed by categorizing the patients into four groups according to baseline RDW value and ΔRDW72hr-adm (RDW at 72 hours - RDW at baseline).

Results

The 28-day and 90-day mortality rates were 10% and 14.6%, respectively. Patients with increased RDW at baseline and ΔRDW72hr-adm > 0.2% exhibited the highest risks of 28-day and 90-day mortality, whereas the patients with normal RDW level at baseline and ΔRDW72hr-adm ≤ 0.2% (the reference group) had the lowest mortality risks. For 90-day mortality, a significantly higher mortality risk was observed in the patients whose RDW increased within 72 hours of ED admission (normal RDW at baseline and ΔRDW72hr-adm > 0.2%), compared to the reference group. These associations remained unaltered even after adjusting for age, sex, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, Charlson Comorbidity Index, renal replacement therapy, albumin, hemoglobin, lactate, C-reactive protein and infection sites in multivariable models.

Conclusions

We found that an increase in RDW from baseline during the first 72 hours after hospitalization is significantly associated with adverse clinical outcomes. Therefore, a combination of baseline RDW value and an increase in RDW can be a promising independent prognostic marker in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock.

### Usefulness of red cell width distribution (RDW) in the assessment of children with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) [^97447d64]. Pediatric Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

RDW is one of the parameters in complete blood count (CBC) that measures variation in red blood cell size or volume (anisocytosis). The most common cause of an elevated RDW is anemia [evaluated in association with mean corpuscular volume (MCV) in differential diagnosis]. Regardless of that higher than normal RDW has also been described as a risk factor for unfavourable clinical course in various diseases in children. RDW is known to be a prognostic marker in adult with pulmonary hypertension. The value of this test in the PAH pediatric population was not yet established. The aim of the study was to evaluate the prognostic value of RDW in children with PAH and utility of this parameter in management.

### Red cell distribution width and red cell distribution width to total serum calcium ratio as major predictors of severity and mortality in acute pancreatitis [^5c80115e]. BMC Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

In the past, RDW was widely used for differential diagnosis of anemia. Over the last years, RDW has been associated with systemic inflammation due to the high oxidative stress and inflammatory cytokines that contribute to RDW elevation by reducing RBC survival and maturation, increasing the release of newer and larger RBC into the peripheral circulation and changing of membrane glycoproteins and ion channels of RBC with consequent morphological alteration. Therefore, RDW reflects the degree of inflammation that occurs in AP and thus, can be used to predict its severity. Despite isolated TSC did not represent a good predictor for AP severity in our study, RDW 0h -to-TSC ratio proved to be an excellent predictor of AP severity and a very good predictor of AP mortality. In fact, hypocalcemia within the first 24 h was associated with AP severity, although its etiopathogenesis is not clearly understood. It has been postulated that hypocalcemia could be related to the calcium soaps formation and parathyroid hormone depletion.

There are some limitations, mainly related to the retrospective nature of this study. However, our study groups' size is within range when compared to other published studies for assessing both severity or mortality in AP. Second, RDW samples were collected from a single center and thus, RDW levels could have been slightly different in other populations studied.

### The role of red cell distribution width in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis: a retrospective case-controlled study [^b6b3439c]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

CRP is a sensitive acute phase protein that lacks specificity due to increased levels in all acute inflammatory processes. Its concentration increases with the duration and extent of the inflammation. In a meta-analysis examining the accuracy of CRP level in the diagnosis of AA, Hallan and Asberg found a wide range of sensitivity (40%-99%) and specificity (27%-90%). Similar to the literature, this study found a sensitivity of 97% and a specificity of 41% for CRP in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis. Among the assessed parameters, CRP had the highest sensitivity and the lowest specificity.

RDW is commonly used to discriminate between microcytic anemia's due to iron deficiency and those due to thalassemia or hemoglobinopathies. Increased RDW levels are related to impaired erythropoiesis or erythrocyte degradation. The typical reference range spans between 11.6 and 15.5%. Recent studies have demonstrated that higher RDW levels, even within the normal reference range, were associated with unfavorable clinical outcomes in patients with heart failure, coronary artery disease, pulmonary hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and stroke independent of hemoglobin values. Furthermore RDW has been studied as a surrogate marker in many pathological conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, colon cancer, and celiac disease. Although the exact pathophysiological basis of this relationship is unclear, chronic inflammation, aging, malnutrition, and anemia are proposed underlying factors in this topic.

### Red blood cell distribution width: an emerging diagnostic factor of acute appendicitis? [^07a4cab2]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Acute appendicitis is the most common surgical abdominal emergency. Immidiate diagnosis of this disease is crucial, because this condition can lead to appendiceal perforation, potential peritonitis, and even death. We read with great interest the article 'The role of red cell distribution width (RDW) in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis: a retrospective case-controlled study' by Narci et al. and wanted to discuss whether RDW alone provide certain information about the inflammatory status of the patient with acute appendicitis.

### Elevated red cell distribution width predicts poor outcome in young patients with community acquired pneumonia [^a7bec852]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Discussion

This study shows that in young patients with CAP, elevated RDW levels on admission either alone or in combination with abnormal levels of WBC are associated with significant higher rates of mortality and complicated hospitalization. RDW level as a prognostic marker was unrelated to hemoglobin levels on admission.

RDW is a simple laboratory test used to evaluate variance in the size and form of red blood cells. It is an important marker in the differential diagnosis of anemia. However, RDW was shown to be a predictor of severe morbidity and mortality in several cardiac problems. There is a large body of evidence showing that RDW is a strong predictor for an adverse outcome in these conditions, equivalent to other known markers, such as low ejection fraction, high New York Heart Association Functional Classification (NYHA) score and elevated serum B-Type Natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels. Moreover, it was recently reported that RDW is a strong predictor of mortality in several other conditions such as obesity, malignancies, and chronic kidney disease. Concordant with our findings, Wang et al. reported recently that a graded independent relation between higher RDW and adverse outcomes in ICU patients.

### Efficiency of red cell distribution width in identification of children aged 1–3 years with iron deficiency anemia against traditional hematological markers [^5537cb91]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

The high incidence of IDA in children emphasizes the need for the cost effective and reliable tool in diagnosing IDA. A number of different indicators, such as hemoglobin, hematocrit, serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, erythropoietin, erythrocyte protoporphyrin, serum iron, mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration have been used to evaluate IDA. But the drawbacks of these tests are that many of them are expensive and require sophisticated laboratories, while others have been found to have a low specificity. It has been seen that anisocytosis occurs, where the erythrocytes produced are of smaller than average size and having a large size variation, due to inadequate iron supply. The morphology and function of erythrocytes at molecular level has been known to be disturbed due to iron deficiency anemia. Therefore, an increase in RDW values may occur in IDA allowing an early detection of ID before reduction in MCV occurs. RDW has been reported to have a high predictive value for IDA and can differentiate beta-thalassemia from other causes of anemia in populations. Our results corroborate the view that RDW evaluated in a large sample performed very well as a screening diagnostic test for identifying iron deficiency anemia. These findings are similar to the findings of earlier studies conducted in other settings and support the usage of RDW as a screening tool for identifying iron deficiency anemia.

### Red cell distribution width is an independent predictor of mortality in necrotizing fasciitis [^a1bb980d]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Necrotizing fasciitis (NF) is a rapidly progressing and potentially lethal infectious disease of the soft tissue. An elevated red blood cell distribution width (RDW) is associated with increased risk of death in patients with heart disease and infectious disease. We retrospectively assessed the association of elevated RDW with in-hospital mortality due to NF.

Methods

All patients had diagnoses of NF and were admitted to the emergency department of a single institution in Taiwan over a 4-year period. Demographics, comorbidities, clinical presentations, and laboratory parameters were retrospectively reviewed. Red blood cell distribution width was categorized as elevated (> 14.5%) or not elevated. Multivariate regression analysis was used to identify risk factors associated with mortality.

Results

A total of 98 patients were enrolled, and the mortality rate was 23%. Univariate analysis indicated that advanced age, initial hypotension, low hemoglobin level, and elevated RDW (69.6% vs 20%, OR = 9.14, P < .001) were significantly associated with mortality. Multivariate analysis indicated that RDW was a significant and independent predictor of mortality in enrolled patients.

Conclusions

Elevated RDW is a significant and independent predictor of in-hospital mortality for patients with NF.

### Red blood cell distribution width is associated with incidence of atrial fibrillation [^a198c83d]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

Red blood cell distribution width (RDW), a measure of variation in erythrocyte volume, has been associated with several cardiovascular disorders, but the relationship with atrial fibrillation (AF) remains unclear. We investigated the association between RDW and incidence of first hospitalization due to AF in a population-based cohort.

Design

Red blood cell distribution width was measured in 27,124 subjects from the general population (age 45–73 years, 62% women) with no history of AF, heart failure, myocardial infarction or stroke. The association between baseline RDW and incidence of AF identified from the Swedish Hospital Discharge Register was evaluated.

Results

During a mean follow-up of 13.6 years, 1894 subjects (53% men) were hospitalized with a diagnosis of AF. After adjustment for potential confounding factors, including cardiovascular disease risk factors, nutrient intake (iron, vitamin B12 and folate) and several haematological parameters (haemoglobin concentration, mean corpuscular volume and corpuscular haemoglobin content), the hazard ratio (HR) for incidence of AF was 1.33 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.16–1.53] for the fourth versus first quartile of RDW (P for trend < 0.001). The results were essentially unchanged when subjects with incident myocardial infarction or hospitalizations because of heart failure were censored from the analysis (HR 1.30, 95% CI 1.13–1.51; P for trend = 0.001).

Conclusion

Red blood cell distribution width was associated with incidence of AF independently of several cardiovascular, nutritional and haematological factors in this study of middle-aged subjects from the general population.

### Relation between red blood cell distribution width and inflammatory biomarkers in a large cohort of unselected outpatients [^f83acf0b]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Context

A strong independent association has been recently observed between elevated red blood cell distribution width (RDW) and increased incidence of cardiovascular events.

Objective

To assess whether RDW is associated with plasma markers of inflammation since the mechanism(s) underlying this association remain unknown.

Design

We retrospectively analyzed results of RDW, hemoglobin, mean corpuscular volume, ferritin, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) in a large cohort of unselected adult outpatients who were consecutively referred by general practitioners for routine medical check-up.

Results

Cumulative results of RDW and other factors were retrieved from the database of our laboratory information system for 3845 adult outpatients during a 3-year period. When participants were grouped according to RDW quartiles, there were strong, graded increases of ESR and hsCRP (P < .001), both parameters being up to 3-fold higher in the fourth versus the first quartile. Accordingly, the percentages of those with hsCRP greater than 3 mg/L (from 28% to 63%; P < .001) and ESR greater than 40 mm/h (from 8% to 40%; P < .001) increased steadily across RDW quartiles. In multivariable regression analysis, ESR and hsCRP predicted RDW independently of age, sex, mean corpuscular volume, hemoglobin, and ferritin.

Conclusions

To our knowledge, our study demonstrates for the first time a strong, graded association of RDW with hsCRP and ESR independent of numerous confounding factors. If confirmed in future follow-up studies, this association might provide a rationale to introduce the easy, inexpensive RDW in algorithms for cardiovascular risk prediction.

### Red cell distribution width as a marker of coeliac disease: a prospective study [^b7a93910]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Coeliac disease is frequently underdiagnosed because of its protean presentations. Serological tests may be helpful in screening programmes for populations at risk, but they are costly.

Aim

To determine prospectively whether a commonly available haematological test such as the red cell distribution width (RDW) could be of help in detecting unrecognized coeliac disease.

Methods

Of 353 consecutive adult patients referred to our outpatient malabsorption clinic, 198 in whom clinical suspicion was strong were referred for further investigations and intestinal biopsy. Seventy-six inflammatory bowel disease outpatients and 90 subjects admitted for diseases other than malabsorption were enrolled as the control group.

Results

RDW was increased in 94 (47.4%) and normal in 104 (52.5%) of 198 patients. Duodenal biopsy confirmed coeliac disease in 80 (85.1%) of the former patients and 69 (66.3%) of the latter patients. No correlation between RDW values and histological scores was found. Overall RDW increase was found in 80/149 (53.7%) patients with a definite diagnosis of coeliac disease, and in 14/49 (28.6%) patients in whom biopsy excluded the disease. A 1-year gluten withdrawal led to a significant decrease in RDW value, even in patients with obdurate mucosal impairment.

Conclusions

In patients in whom there is a strong clinical suspicion of coeliac disease, an elevated RDW despite normal haemoglobin concentration may be a reliable predictor of the disease.

### Iron deficiency and heart failure: diagnostic dilemmas and therapeutic perspectives [^1cd3a779]. European Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

The red cell distribution width (RDW) reflecting MCV heterogeneity (quantitative index of anisocytosis, i.e. the percentage coefficient of MCV variation) can be considered another parameter of ID. Increased RDW is, however, typical not only for anaemia due to ID, but also anaemia resulting from deficiencies in vitamin B 12 and folic acid, of chronic diseases and sideroblastic anaemia. In HF patients, there are associations between high RDW, and reduced haemoglobin, low MCV, reduced Tsat, increased mortality and hospitalization rates. –

Owing to pathophysiological links and overlaps in regulatory mechanisms of erythropoietin and iron metabolism, – subjects with ID frequently have increased circulating erythropoietin levels, which can be considered another index of iron-restricted erythropoiesis in HF patients, being related to poor outcomes.

Increased soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) is another sensitive indicator of ID. Soluble transferrin receptor is the truncated form of transmembrane protein, a receptor for iron–transferrin complex and the major system responsible for the intracellular iron import. It is present on virtually all cells, but a vast majority is localized on erythroid precursors. When iron delivery to target tissues is insufficient for metabolic requirements, the expression of the transferrin receptor increases in order to facilitate intracellular iron influx. Consequently, circulating sTfR (originating from all cells metabolizing iron) quantitatively reflects both the tissue iron demand (tissue iron balance) and the erythroid proliferation rate (total erythroblast mass), but not body iron stores. No study has used this biomarker to indicate and/or guide therapy, and so it should be regarded as a research tool.

Because serum ferritin is a surrogate of iron stores and serum sTfR reflects the tissue iron demand, there is evidence that the combination of these two parameters may describe the iron status more accurately.

### Red cell distribution width as a marker of activity in inflammatory bowel disease: a narrative review [^7485eba4]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Table 1
Conditions that elevate red cell distribution width

Apart from its usual application as a hematologic parameter, RDW has been extensively studied as an inflammatory marker, along with its capability to express the activity and severity of various disease states and conditions. Probably the first recorded strong correlation of RDW with laboratory indices of inflammation, such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), came after a retrospective study of 3845 outpatient adults performed by Lippi et al.

Cardiovascular diseases, malignancy, chronic lower respiratory diseases, metabolic syndrome, chronic kidney disease and autoimmune disorders belong to a group of disorders where inflammation and oxidative stress comprise the major pathophysiologic insults. Data from the international literature showed that in these clinical entities, an elevated RDW value was related to an increased risk of morbidity and mortality and could be used as a predictor of an unfavorable disease course.

Despite the encouraging data concerning its potential as a prognostic marker of morbidity, mortality and unfavorable disease course in various pathologic conditions, in everyday clinical practice RDW remains a parameter used to define and differentiate anemias.

### The effect of intravenous ferric carboxymaltose on red cell distribution width: a subanalysis of the FAIR-HF study [^050fa2ca]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2013). Low credibility.

Aims

Red cell distribution width (RDW), a measure of variability in red blood cell size, is a novel prognostic marker in chronic heart failure (CHF). Iron deficiency contributes to elevated RDW. In the FAIR-HF trial, i.v. ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) improved the 6 min walk test (6MWT) distance in iron-deficient CHF patients. We studied the effect of FCM on RDW and the relationship between RDW and 6MWT distance.

Methods and Results

In FAIR-HF, iron-deficient CHF patients were randomized to FCM or placebo in a 2:1 ratio. From the total cohort (n = 459), we included 415 patients in whom RDW values and 6MWT distance were available for baseline and at least one follow-up visit (after 4, 12, and 24 weeks). Baseline RDW was higher in anaemic (haemoglobin < 12 g/dL) compared with non-anaemic patients [15.2% (14.0–16.8) vs. 14.2% (13.4–15.4), P < 0.0001, median (interquartile range)]. In multivariate analysis, RDW was significantly associated with transferrin saturation (P < 0.001) and C-reactive protein levels (P = 0.002). Treatment with FCM led to a biphasic response; RDW increased within 4 weeks (+0.54% absolute change from baseline, P = 0.01) but fell to values below the placebo group after 24 weeks (-1.0%, P = 0.03). The 6MWT distance and RDW were inversely related at baseline (r = -0.30, P < 0.0001). In all patients, the increase in 6MWT distance after 24 weeks was significantly correlated with a decrease in RDW (r = -0.25, P < 0.0001), even after adjustment for changes in haemoglobin.

Conclusions

Iron deficiency in CHF is associated with high RDW, even after adjustment for the presence of anaemia. Treatment with i.v. FCM in iron-deficient CHF patients decreases RDW.

### Red cell distribution width associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease [^50534230]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

In this study, we investigated the association of RDW with major composite CV outcomes and mortality in patients with CKD. The elevated RDW group had older patients, a lower proportion of male patients, lower LVEF levels, lower hemoglobin levels, lower albumin levels, and higher serum creatinine levels compared with the normal RDW group. RDW levels exhibited a graded increase across different stages of CKD. RDW ≥ 14.5% was associated with a significantly higher incidence of major composite CV outcomes and a trend toward higher mortality. A greater than 2-fold risk of major composite CV outcomes was observed in the elevated RDW group (HR = 2.581, CI = 1.541–4.322, P < .001). Age and impaired LVEF were additional covariates that were independent predictors of major composite CV outcomes in patients with CKD. The incidence of outcomes is higher than that reported in a previous study, because our patients were confirmed to have CAD.

Patients with higher RDW levels are often considered to have erythropoietic stress. In the general population, patients with higher RDW levels are likely to be older and have smoking habits, higher body mass index, lower hemoglobin levels, lower mean corpuscular volume, and higher serum creatinine levels. Elevated RDW was correlated with higher serum levels of N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), a larger left atrium, and lower LVEF values in patients with CV risk. RDW levels were also positively associated with C-reactive protein, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, ferritin, and fibrinogen and negatively associated with albumin levels. Consequently, RDW was supposed to be a marker of inflammation, oxidative stress, and nutritional status.

The pathophysiology of elevated RDW toward unfavorable CV outcomes has not been elucidated. Anemia and elevated serum creatinine, commonly occurring in patients with CKD, were risk factors for CV events. Our results reveal that the effect of RDW on major composite CV outcomes was independent of hemoglobin and creatinine levels. This finding is consistent with those of previous studies, which have reported that the level of RDW, even within the normal reference range, was associated with a higher risk of CV events and mortality irrespective of anemia, ferritin levels, and renal impairment. There should be other explanations for the poor prognostic effect of RDW on major composite CV outcomes in patients with CKD. Two novel risk factors for CV events, oxidative stress and inflammation, could be possible underlying mechanisms.

### The relationship between red blood cell distribution width and islet β-cell function indexes in patients with latent autoimmune diabetes in adults [^024dfd51]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Red Blood Cell Distribution Width (RDW) is an index of red blood cell (RBC) size variability and is calculated as the standard deviation in RBC size divided by the mean corpuscular volume (MCV). Emerging evidence suggests that, besides RBC abnormalities, diverse human pathologies have been frequently associated with anisocytosis. RDW is also considered as a novel inflammation marker associated with poor prognosis in many clinical scenarios and populations, including patients with increased mortality risk with COVID-19, acute stroke, myocardial infarction, and type 2 diabetes.

Diabetes mellitus is a global concern that causes an enormous burden to society and individuals. Latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) is a kind of adult-onset autoimmune diabetes, which shows the feathers of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus. It is a heterogeneous form of diabetes with a pathogenesis that includes both autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta cells as well as some degrees of insulin resistance. These genotypes and its interaction with environmental factors result in a wide range of clinical phenotypes. However, the clinical characterization of these patients in the primary care setting is lacking, and its clinical progression is unpredictable. Despite its important clinical relevance, Patients with LADA are often misdiagnosed and show a sustained worse glycemic control compared to T2DM.

Studies pointed that an increase in RDW level has been shown to be closely related to T2DM or its complications and a marker of worsening diabetes control. A reduction in counts of red blood cells and levels of haemoglobin in Swedish TEDDY children with multiple islet autoantibodies has been shown, and RDW values are significantly associated with HOMA-β and HbA1c. However, there are currently little clinical research on the correlation between red blood cell distribution and islet β-cell function among patients with LADA. Considering the importance of patients with LADA, the purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between RDW and islet β-cell function in patients with LADA.

### Red cell distribution width as a marker of activity in inflammatory bowel disease: a narrative review [^62d22b8d]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Concluding remarks

The results from studies included in this review showed that mean values of RDW were statistically significantly higher in IBD patients compared to controls. With respect to the rather limited data, based on only 2 clinical trials, RDW could be used as an effective marker to differentiate CD from UC in both the active state and remission. In the majority of the aforementioned studies RDW, at different cutoff values, showed a remarkable sensitivity and specificity in detecting active disease, calculated by means of clinical indices, endoscopic scores and laboratory parameters. RDW also showed a positive but variable correlation with well-established inflammatory biomarkers used in everyday clinical practice such as CRP, ESR, and to a lesser extent WBC and PLT, in both anemic and non-anemic IBD patients. Therefore, RDW could be considered an attractive disease activity marker in IBD, as it is calculated automatically in every CBC, has a low cost, is minimally invasive, has no specific technical requirements and can be easily reproduced.

On the other hand, there are certain aspects concerning its broad application that must be elucidated. There was great variability in the thresholds adopted for the assessment of diagnostic accuracy. In addition, the selection of cutoffs was arbitrary and data driven. Most studies were retrospective and were case-control studies. The use of controls in diagnostic accuracy studies usually results in overestimation of both sensitivity and specificity. Large-scale well-designed prospective studies for standardization of the cutoff value of RDW should now be mandatory. It is also necessary to conduct such studies in order to evaluate whether the limited but rather encouraging data are sufficient to establish RDW as a reliable activity index. Finally, there is a need to look deeper and clarify the pathophysiology of this relation. RDW seems to be a promising cost-effective tool that can be used to evaluate and monitor disease activity in IBD, but this requires more extensive and detailed research in the future.

### Red blood cell distribution width and 1-year mortality in acute heart failure [^6c80264e]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2010). Low credibility.

Aims

Red blood cell distribution width (RDW) predicts mortality in chronic heart failure (HF) and stable coronary artery disease. The prognostic value of RDW in more acute settings such as acute HF, and its relative prognostic value compared with more established measures such as N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), remains unknown.

Methods and Results

In a cohort of 205 patients with acute HF, independent predictors of RDW were identified using linear regression analysis. The association between RDW and 1-year survival in the context of other predictors was assessed using Cox's proportional hazards analysis. Red blood cell distribution width was elevated in 67 (32.7%) patients; RDW was independently associated with haematological variables such as haemoglobin (P < 0.001) as well as the use of loop diuretics (P = 0.006) and beta-blockers (P = 0.015) on presentation, but not with nutritional deficiencies, recent transfusion, or inflammatory variables. Log-transformed RDW values independently predicted mortality in multivariable Cox's proportional hazards analysis (hazards ratio, 1.03; 95% confidence interval, 1.00–1.06; P = 0.04); when stratified on the basis of RDW and NT-proBNP status, the combination provided additional prognostic information.

Conclusion

Red blood cell distribution width is frequently elevated among patients with acute HF and does not appear to be associated with nutritional status, transfusion history, or inflammation. Red blood cell distribution width independently predicts 1-year mortality in acute HF. The value of RDW appears additive to other established prognostic variables such as NT-proBNP.

### Red blood cell distribution width and mortality risk in hospitalized adults with SARS-CoV-2 infection… [^cddea7e6]. JAMA Network (2020). Excellent credibility.

Patients whose RDW increased during hospitalization had higher mortality compared with those whose RDW did not change; for those with normal RDW, mortality increased from 6% to 24%, and for those with an elevated RDW at admission, mortality increased from 22% to 40%. Conclusions and Relevance Elevated RDW at the time of hospital admission and an increase in RDW during hospitalization were associated with increased mortality risk for patients with COVID-19 who received treatment at 4 hospitals in a large academic medical center network. RDW is the coefficient of variation in RBC volume, or the SD divided by the mean. An increase in RDW must therefore correspond to a decrease in mean RBC volume, an increase in RBC volume variance, or both. Previous studies6, 8, 17, 19 have found evidence in some specific conditions that RDW elevation is caused by delayed clearance of older RBCs.

Because RBCs characteristically decrease in cellular volume across their lifespan, persistence of these older, smaller cells thus increases volume variance, and this clearance delay coincides with and offsets a net decrease in RBC production. 6, 8, 17 These reports suggest the possibility that an elevated RDW in some circumstances may reflect a clinical state in which RBC production and turnover have slowed in the setting of increased production and turnover of leukocytes or platelets such as would occur in inflammation. Risk ratios for different age groups were significantly different compared with each other, suggesting an effect modification, with an elevated RDW having a larger effect on mortality for younger patients than it had for older patients. The average MCV differed by a factor of only about 1.
01.

Although the true baseline RDW for the elevated RDW group is unknown, these results suggest that the major contributor to elevated RDW is an increase in variance of the RBC volume distribution instead of a decrease in MCV. COVID-19 is associated with altered turnover in all WBC lineages, as noted previously, as well as with altered platelet dynamics in COVID-associated coagulopathy. 32 The association of elevated RDW with COVID-19 severity could be consistent with previous reports, suggesting that RDW can become elevated when RBC production kinetics have slowed in the setting of increased WBC and platelet kinetics. 6, 8, 17.

### Association of red blood cell distribution width and hemoglobin-to-RDW ratio with contrast-associated acute kidney injury in patients undergoing coronary angiography: a retrospective study [^d2fe5903]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Contrast‐associated acute kidney injury (CA‐AKI) is a significant concern in medical practice, ranking as the third leading cause of hospital‐acquired acute kidney injury. Its prevalence varies, affecting 1%–2% of the general population, but the risk can be significantly higher, up to 50%, in high‐risk groups. Several established risk factors, including severe chronic kidney disease, hypotension, excessive contrast medium, anemia, and diabetes, have been linked to an increased likelihood of CA‐AKI and have been incorporated into risk stratification models.

Inflammation has been identified as a key player in the development and progression of various diseases, including cardiovascular conditions like CA‐AKI. Numerous studies have highlighted the prognostic value of systemic inflammatory markers in CA‐AKI patients, independent of traditional risk factors. These markers include C‐reactive protein (CRP), interleukin‐6, and white blood cell count.

In addition to established inflammatory markers, red blood cell distribution width (RDW) has gained attention as an informative and cost‐effective indicator of systemic inflammation. A growing body of research has demonstrated the prognostic significance of RDW in inflammation‐related cardiovascular diseases, such as atherosclerosis and ischemic cardiac conditions. Hemoglobin, on the other hand, is a critical parameter reflecting anemia, which is a traditional risk factor for CA‐AKI. Hemoglobin‐to‐RDW ratio (HRR), a novel metric introduced by Sun et al. is a novel indicator of chronic inflammation combining the prognostic information from hemoglobin and RDW. Accordingly, the accessibility of RDW and HRR in clinical practice for CA‐AKI seems reasonable and potentially valuable.

Therefore, this retrospective study set out to determine the associations of RDW and HRR with CA‐AKI in patients undergoing coronary angiography (CAG) or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), for the sake of aggressive management to reduce the risk of CA‐AKI.

### Utility of red cell distribution width in screening for iron deficiency [^e6b1b0d9]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2013). Low credibility.

Aims

To assess the sensitivity of an adult-derived red cell distribution width (RDW) reference limit in the detection of iron deficiency in young children.

Methods

Haematological analysis performed on a cohort of 13-month-old healthy term infants of North European ancestry.

Results

21/98 infants were iron-deficient (> 2.5% hypochromic red cells). Of the remaining 77, 35 with RDW > 13.9% also had evidence of incipient iron deficiency on the basis of significantly lower haemoglobin (11.5 vs 11.8 g/dl, p = 0.046), mean cell volume (75.6 vs 77.8 fl, p = 0.002) and mean cell haemoglobin (25.4 vs 26.2 pg, p = 0.002) values and higher zinc protoporphyrin (55 vs 44 μmol/molhaem, p < 0.001) values than those of the 42 with RDW ≤ 13.9%.

Conclusions

An adult-derived RDW reference limit has utility in screening for iron deficiency at the age of 13 months. The incidence of non-anaemic iron deficiency in this group was 52.8%.

### Prognostic significance of red cell distribution width to albumin ratio in ICU patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: a retrospective analysis [^203ca790]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a type of metabolic stress liver injury characterized by the presence of 5% or more steatosis in liver cells, which is associated with metabolic risk factors. Due to the potential pathogenesis of NAFLD, an international panel of experts has recommended that its name be changed to "Metabolic dysfunction-related fatty liver Disease" (MAFLD). Currently, NAFLD is recognized as the most common liver disease, and its prevalence is increasing every year, affecting approximately 25% of adults worldwide. Individuals with NAFLD are not only at risk for more severe liver damage, such as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), liver cirrhosis, and even hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but they also face a heightened risk for extra-hepatic events like metabolic syndrome (MetS), cardiovascular complications, diabetes (DM), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and cancers. This situation places a significant economic and healthcare burden on society. Therefore, it is essential to identify simple and reliable biomarkers for early intervention in NAFLD.

Although liver biopsy remains the gold standard for evaluating disease severity and treatment response, its invasive nature and limitations hinder widespread use. In contrast, hematological and imaging techniques have gained much attention due to their noninvasive and reproducible advantages.

Extensive evidence indicates that inflammation significantly impacts the onset and progression of NAFLD by promoting insulin resistance, oxidative stress, liver inflammation, hepatic steatosis, and hepatic fibrosis. Red blood cell distribution width (RDW) is a routine laboratory item identifying abnormal size distribution of red blood cells (RBC) in peripheral blood. Elevated RDW is linked to systemic inflammation and various diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), etc. Serum albumin reflects nutritional and inflammatory status, and lower albumin levels have been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular death. Combining these two measures may be a more meaningful assessment of disease prognosis. So far, the red blood cell distribution width/albumin ratio (RAR) is considered a potential risk biomarker for adverse outcomes related to diabetes vascular complications, MetS, CKD, heart failure, and other disorders.

By restricted cubic spline model and smooth curve fitting (after adjusting for age, sex, race, PIR, education level, BMI, smoking status, drinking status, hypertension, CVD, diabetes, WBC, and anemia), we found that there was a non-linear relationship between RDW and all-cause mortality in patients with COPD (P for non-linearity = 0.003) (Fig. 3 A). Conversely, there were linear dose–response relationships between RDW and the risk of CVD mortality (P for nonlinearity = 0.144) (Fig. 3 B) and CLRD-related mortality (P for nonlinearity = 0.492) (Fig. 3 C). As the RDW level increases, there is a noticeable trend in the risk of CVD mortality and CLRD-related mortality, demonstrating an upward trajectory. And there were linear dose–response relationships between HRR and the risk of all-cause mortality (P for nonlinearity = 0.18) (Fig. 3 D) and CVD mortality (P for nonlinearity = 0.862) (Fig. 3 E).

### Association of red blood cell distribution width with mortality risk in hospitalized adults with SARS-CoV-2 infection [^32b555fa]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Mortality hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated using a Cox proportional hazards model. Models were fit with univariate inputs and multivariate inputs, using RDW, age, race, and ethnicity, and 2 clinical COVID-19 risk factors: absolute lymphocyte count, and D-dimer level. Owing to known demographic risk profiles, race and ethnicity were encoded as binary variables to compare higher risk groups with lower risk groups. Race was coded as 1 for Black/African American, and 0 for all other groups. Ethnicity was coded as 1 for Hispanic, and 0 for non-Hispanic/unknown. Models were fit with variables catgorized as either continuous or binary using a risk threshold. Risk thresholds were defined as age older than 70 years, RDW greater than 14.5%, absolute lymphocyte count < 0.8 × 10⁹/L, and D-dimer level greater than 1500 ng/mL (to convert to nanomoles per liter, multiply by 0.005476). Thresholds for age, absolute lymphocyte count, and D-dimer level were chosen based on previous COVID-19 studies. Using these thresholds, each high-risk cohort was of a similar size: age older than 70 years (30% of patients), RDW greater than 14.5% (34% of patients), lymphocyte count less than 0.8 × 10⁹/L (26% of patients), D-dimer level higher than 1500 ng/L (26% of patients). For continuous models, HRs were normalized based on clinically meaningful changes in the measurements: 10 years for age, 0.5% for RDW, 0.1 × 10⁹/L for absolute lymphocyte count, and 100 mg/L for D-dimer level. For ease of comparison, HRs for absolute lymphocyte count were inverted to represent the increased risk for a decrease in value. All other HRs were relative to increases. Multivariate proportional hazards models were also fit using patient comorbidities, with results presented in the eTable 3 in the Supplement. To account for potential effect modification, models were fit separately for each age category (eTable 2 in the Supplement). For completeness, models were also fit incorporating other blood count measures (eTable 4 in the Supplement).

### Red blood cell distribution width is a predictor of readmission in cardiac patients [^227b8dc7]. Clinical Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Three-quarters of rehospitalizations ($44 billion yearly estimated cost) may be avoidable. A screening tool for the detection of potential readmission may facilitate more efficient case management.

Hypothesis

An elevated red blood cell distribution width (RDW) is an independent predictor of hospital readmission in patients with unstable angina (UA) or non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).

Methods

The study is a retrospective observational cohort analysis of adults admitted in 2007 with UA or NSTEMI. Data were gathered by review of inpatient medical records. The rate of 30-day nonelective readmission and time to nonelective readmission were recorded until November 1, 2011, and compared by RDW group using the 95th percentile (16.3%) as a cutoff.

Results

The median follow-up time of the 503 subjects (average age, 65 ± 13 years; 56% male) was 3.8 years (interquartile range: 0.3–4.3 years). Those readmitted within 30 days were older, had more comorbidities and higher RDW and creatinine levels, and were more likely to have had an intervention. At 3.8 years of follow-up, subjects with high RDW (> 16.3%) were more likely to be readmitted compared to those with normal RDW (≤ 16.3%) (72.28% vs 59.95%, P = 0.003). In multivariable analyses, high RDW was a statistically significant predictor of readmission in general (hazard ratio: 1.35 (95% confidence interval [CI]:1.02–1.79), P = 0.033) but not of 30-day rehospitalization (odds ratio: 1.34 (95% CI: 0.78–2.31), P = 0.292). Its area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.54 (sensitivity 23% and specificity 85%).

Conclusions

An elevated RDW is an independent predictor of hospital readmission in patients with UA or NSTEMI.

### Red cell distribution width as a marker of activity in inflammatory bowel disease: a narrative review [^1cd238c5]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Clinical utility of RDW

RDW, a parameter measured automatically in every complete blood count (CBC), is an actual reflection of RBC size variability and heterogeneity. RDW is considered as a reliable index of the anisocytosis of the RBC population circulating in peripheral blood. There are 2 different ways to express RDW statistically: as a coefficient of variation (RDW-CV) and/or a standard deviation (RDW-SD). RDW-SD (expressed in fL) is an actual evaluation of the width of the RBC size distribution histogram and is quantified after determination of the width (in fL) at the 20% height level of that histogram. This index is therefore not influenced by the average size of the RBC population, the mean corpuscular volume (MCV).

On the other hand, RDW-CV (expressed in %) is derived from a mathematical formula that includes SD and MCV:

RDW-CV (%) = 1 standard deviation of RBC volume / MCV × 100% and it is affected by variations in RBC size. Anemias were traditionally classified, according to their MCV value, as microcytic (MCV below the reference range), normocytic (MCV within the reference range) and macrocytic (MCV above the reference range). In the early 80s a different approach was proposed for anemia classification using both RDW and MCV.

Based on this classification, 2 distinct entities of anemias were described: one with a homogeneous erythrocyte population and normal RDW, and a second with a heterogeneous erythrocyte population and a greater RDW. The main conditions that influence and elevate RDW value include anemias due to nutritional deficiencies (iron, B12 and folate), hemoglobinopathies, hemolytic anemias, and sickle-cell anemia (Table 1).

### Red blood cell distribution width and the platelet count in iron-deficient children aged 0.5–3 years [^ee97da86]. Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (2015). Low credibility.

Early detection of iron deficiency (ID) and iron deficiency anemia (IDA) in young children is important to prevent impaired neurodevelopment. Unfortunately, many biomarkers of ID are influenced by infection, thus limiting their usefulness. The aim of this study was to investigate the value of red blood cell distribution width (RDW) and the platelet count for detecting ID(A) among otherwise healthy children. A multicenter prospective observational study was conducted in the Netherlands to investigate the prevalence of ID(A) in 400 healthy children aged 0.5–3 years. ID was defined as serum ferritin (SF) < 12 μg/L in the absence of infection (C-reactive protein [CRP] < 5 mg/L) and IDA as hemoglobin < 110 g/L combined with ID. RDW (%) and the platelet count were determined in the complete blood cell count. RDW was inversely correlated with SF and not associated with CRP. Calculated cutoff values for RDW to detect ID and IDA gave a relatively low sensitivity (53.1% and 57.1%, respectively) and specificity (64.7% and 69.9%, respectively). Anemic children with a RDW > 14.3% had a 2.7 higher odds (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.2–6.3) to be iron deficient, compared with anemic children with a RDW < 14.3%. The platelet count showed a large range in both ID and non-ID children. In conclusion, RDW can be helpful for identifying ID as the cause of anemia in 0.5- to 3-year-old children, but not as primary biomarker of ID(A). RDW values are not influenced by the presence of infection. There appears to be no role for the platelet count in diagnosing ID(A) in this group of children.

### Progressive rise in red cell distribution width is associated with disease progression in ambulatory patients with chronic heart failure [^5b0571b6]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Single red cell distribution width (RDW) assessment is a consistent prognostic marker of poor outcomes in heart failure as well as in other patient cohorts. The objective of this study was to determine the prognostic value of sequential RDW assessment in ambulatory patients with chronic heart failure.

Methods and Results

We reviewed 6,159 consecutive ambulatory patients with chronic heart failure between 2001–2006 and examined changes in RDW values from baseline to 1-year follow-up. Clinical, demographic, laboratory, and ICD-9 coding data were extracted from electronic health records, and all-cause mortality was followed over a mean follow-up of 4.4 ± 2.4 years. In this study cohort, median baseline RDW was 14.9%. RDW > 16% at baseline (18.5% of cohort) was associated with a higher mortality rates than RDW ≤ 16%. For each +1% increment of baseline RDW, the risk ratio for all-cause mortality was 1.17 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.15–1.19; P < .0001). At 12-month follow-up (n = 1,601), a large majority of subjects (68% in first tertile, 56% in second tertile of baseline RDW) showed rising RDW and correspondingly higher risk for all-cause mortality (risk ratio for +1% increase in changes in RDW was 1.08 (95% CI 1.03–1.13; P = 0.001). This effect was independent of anemia status or other baseline cardiac or renal indices, and particularly strong in those with lower baseline RDW.

Conclusions

In our ambulatory cohort of patients with chronic heart failure, baseline and serial increases in RDW were associated with poor long-term outcomes independently from standard cardiac, hematologic, and renal indices.

### Red cell distribution width and dementia among rural-dwelling older adults: the MIND-China study [^183deba4]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2021). Medium credibility.

It is unclear why the association between RDW and dementia was evident, especially among people without anemia. At the beginning of abnormal hematopoiesis, there is a mixture of normal erythrocytes and variable-sized erythrocytes in circulation. A substantial increase in RDW levels may be prior to decline in hemoglobin and the development of anemia. This means that an elevated RDW could capture additional information about risk beyond what anemia and hemoglobin may capture. However, the association of greater RDW levels with dementia was attenuated among older adults with anemia, which is similar to the well-established relationships between RDW and mortality. RDW and anemia may share the same underlying mechanisms of dementia, such as hypoxia, folic acid and vitamin deficiencies, iron deficiency, and oxidative stress. Hence, the association of RDW with cognitive aging can be diluted when developing anemia.

Our study was the first community-based study to explore the relationship between RDW and anemia and cognitive aging in rural-dwelling Chinese older adults, in which comprehensive data were collected following standard protocols. However, our study has limitations. Firstly, we could not determine the causal relationship of RDW with cognitive outcomes due to the cross-sectional design. However, our findings imply that elevated RDW may be a biochemical marker for the dementias. Secondly, we were unable to explore in-depth the potential neuropathological mechanisms underlying the relationship between RDW and cognitive outcomes owing to lack of relevant data (e.g. plasma inflammatory markers, amyloid-β, and tau proteins). Furthermore, RDW is associated with nutritional anemia, and the lack of nutritional markers, such as serum vitamin B12, folate, and iron parameters (e.g. serum iron, ferritin, binding capacity, and percentage saturation), prevents us from comprehensively exploring the relationships between RDW, anemia, and dementia. Finally, our study sample was selected from one rural area of western Shandong province where participants had no or limited education and relatively low income. This should be kept in mind when generalizing our research findings to other populations.

### Efficiency of red cell distribution width in identification of children aged 1–3 years with iron deficiency anemia against traditional hematological markers [^87569899]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Iron deficiency is the most common micronutrient deficiency among Indian preschool children contributing to increased burden of morbidity and mortality and the most significant negative consequence of iron deficiency is iron deficiency anemia (IDA). Recent NFHS–III surveys (2005–06) have shown that 70–85% (approx. 79.2%) of Indian young children have anemia. IDA is attributed to inadequate iron intake, poor bioavailability of iron or high nutritional needs during childhood which is further exacerbated by chronic intestinal blood losses due to helminth infections and in many areas due to severe malarial infections. Studies have shown that iron deficiency causes delay in cognitive development and poor motor and sensory system functioning and that iron supplementation in early years may prevent these complications among children. Conversely, there is an evidence suggesting that routine iron treatment in non-iron deficient children may have adverse consequences for morbidity and infections. Therefore, it is very important to detect iron deficiency (ID) at its earliest stage in children especially in a low resource setting and replenish the iron stores by proper supplementation, thereby preventing many of the adverse developmental and behavioral effects caused by IDA. Currently, the detection of IDA is largely dependent upon quantification of biochemical markers like serum ferritin (SFr), serum transferrin (STr) and zinc protoporphyrin (ZnPP) which are not routinely available and affordable in developing countries due to high costs. Moreover, these tests are altered by inflammation, which limits their applicability for clinical interpretation, especially in areas with high infection rates. Another limitation of the commonly used hematological tests is their poor sensitivity or specificity as they can be modified by conditions other than iron deficiency. Studies have shown that RDW in addition to other hematological markers like mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and hemoglobin can be used as a differential diagnostic tool for identification of iron deficiency anemia. Various studies also show that the onset of iron deficiency anemia can be predicted using automated blood analyzers, as a low haemoglobin level along with a high level of anisocytosis detectable by red cell distribution width prove to be good indicators of changes in blood due to depleted iron stores. It seems that the earliest hematological manifestation of iron deficiency is marked by an elevated level of RDW and reports have shown that it is a cost-effective screening tool for early diagnosis of IDA in comparison to SFr and ZnPP. The red blood cell (RBC) distribution width, a measure of variations in the width of circulating RBCs, reported as a part of complete blood count has been known to be of value in the discrimination of iron deficiency anemia from other causes of microcytic anemia, but studies in pediatric populations are lacking. Thus, in the present study we evaluated the discriminative ability of RDW diagnostic test for detecting iron deficiency anemia among children aged 1–3 yrs in a low socio-economic setting using receiver's operating characteristic curve (ROC) analyses.

### Red blood cell distribution width: an emerging diagnostic factor of acute appendicitis? [^89651015]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Dear editor

We read with great interest the article 'The role of red cell distribution width in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis: a retrospective case-controlled study' by Narci et al. They aimed to evaluate whether red cell distribution width (RDW) has a role in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis. The authors concluded that if compared to healthy controls, RDW levels were lower in patients with acute appendicitis. Being inexpensive and easy attainability of this parameter may strengthen its utilization in daily practice in the near future. We would like to thank the authors for their contribution.

RDW which is used in the differential diagnosis of anemia, is an automated measure of the variability of red blood cell size. Previously it was shown that, RDW is an independent variable of prognosis in patients with cardiovascular diseases such as heart failure, myocardial infarction, strokes, and pulmonary hypertension. In addition, it was also found to be related to mortality and other severe adverse outcomes in renal and infectious diseases. Aging, malnutrition, Iron or vitamin B12 deficiency, bone marrow depression, or chronic inflammation may affect RDW levels. Thus, it would have been better, if the authors had mentioned these RDW affecting factors.

In a previous study, two novel biomarkers, calprotectin (CP) and serum amyloid A (SAA) were found to be related to acute appendicitis. Recent studies have demonstrated that Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio and mean platelet volume (MPV) are also associated with inflammatory diseases. In this view, it would also be relevant, if the authors included these parameters in the study.

We are of the opinion that the findings of Narci et al. will lead to further research concerning the relationship between RDW and acute appendicitis. Nevertheless, RDW should be considered with other inflammatory markers (e.g. C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, calprotectin) to provide certain information about the inflammatory status of the patient.

### Efficiency of red cell distribution width in identification of children aged 1–3 years with iron deficiency anemia against traditional hematological markers [^2f6ca6c8]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, RDW > 15% and hemoglobin ≤ 10.0 g/dL measured using a simple coulter can be used as a valuable screening tool for identifying children with iron deficiency anemia in a low socio-economic setting. Although it needs to be further investigated in other populations, there is no reason to believe that results will vary from the present study. If these findings are confirmed in other settings as well, it offers a very useful tool for screening iron deficient anemic children without need for more expensive iron status marker investigations.

### Relation of red cell distribution width to left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and mortality in patients with and without heart failure [^efc59c35]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Higher red cell distribution width (RDW) has been associated with poor prognosis in patients with heart failure (HF). RDW is also closely associated with iron deficiency. However, the mechanism underlying this association is unclear. The relation between left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) and RDW has not been studied, especially in those without HF. We examined the relation between LVEDP and RDW in 1,084 consecutive stable patients who underwent elective coronary angiography. We observed that 38% had high LVEDP (> 16 mm Hg) and 29% had history of HF. The median RDW was 13.4%, which was higher with increasing LVEDP (p < 0.0001) and significantly higher in patients with HF (p < 0.0001). Baseline RDW were independently associated with high LVEDP even after multivariable logistic regression analysis (adjusted odds ratio [OR] per unit change 1.14, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.0 to 1.29, p = 0.044). Interestingly, result were stronger in non-HF cohort (adjusted OR per unit change 1.37, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.67, p = 0.001). In addition, elevated (third vs first tertiles) RDW levels were independently a predictor of high LVEDP and were associated with a 4.8-fold increased 5-year mortality risk (adjusted hazard ratio 4.11, 95% CI 2.12 to 7.96, p < 0.0001), even with the addition of B-type natriuretic peptide to the model (adjusted OR for LVEDP 2.25, 95% CI 1.0 to 5.05, p = 0.05; adjusted hazard ratio for mortality 3.79, 95% CI 1.033 to 13.89, p = 0.044, respectively). In conclusion, high RDW levels were observed in patients with or without HF and independently associated with high LVEDP and with mortality.

### Red blood cell distribution width and the risk of death in middle-aged and older adults… [^33541999]. JAMA Network (2009). Excellent credibility.

For every 1% increment in RDW, all-cause mortality risk increased by 22%. Even when analyses were restricted to nonanemic participants or to those in the reference range of RDW without iron, folate, or vitamin B12 deficiency, RDW remained strongly associated with mortality. The prognostic effect of RDW was observed in both middle-aged and older adults for multiple causes of death. Further adjustment for major age-associated diseases as well as education, BMI, smoking status, hospitalizations, renal function, hemoglobin concentration, MCV, and CRP level only partially attenuated the effect of RDW on all-cause mortality. Even when the study population was restricted to those with serum markers of nutrition, higher RDW remained strongly associated with increased risk of death while adjusting for all potential confounding factors including iron, folate, and vitamin B12 deficiency.

Figure 2 illustrates that the association of RDW with mortality adjusted for multiple risk factors occurs in both middle-aged and older adults. There was a significant trend of increased risk of death from all causes with higher RDW in both age groups. Although the number of events was much smaller in participants aged 45 to 64 years than in those 65 years or older, risk of death from CVDs, cancer, and other causes was significantly higher in participants in the highest RDW quintile compared with those in the lowest quintile for both age groups. In fact, Figure 3 illustrates that there was a continuous rise in mortality risk among participants with RDW values of 11. 0% to
15. 0%. For every percentage point increase in RDW, the risk of death increased by 37%, adjusting for demographic, behavioral, and biomedical risk factors.

Inflammation might contribute to increased RDW levels by not only impairing iron metabolism but also by inhibiting the production of or response to erythropoietin or by shortening RBC survival. 15, 16 Using an index comprised of multiple proinflammatory cytokines, Ferrucci et al17 showed that higher levels of inflammation were associated with higher erythropoietin concentration among nonanemic older adults, whereas an inverse association was observed in anemic persons.

### Red blood cell distribution width as a prognostic marker in patients with heart failure and diabetes mellitus [^e5cb7dac]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2017). Low credibility.

The presence of anemia is associated with a special risk in patients with any form of proatherosclerotic condition and heart disease. Despite the fact that clinical and hemodynamical changes due to acute, short-lasting anemia are reversible, chronic anemia can lead to cardiac enlargement and left ventricular hypertrophy due to volume overload. Anemia is considered to be a mediator and a marker of a poor outcome in HF, a risk factor for ischemic heart disease, and often coexists in patients with acute coronary syndromes. Notably, in patients with stable coronary artery disease, higher RDW is a strong and independent prognostic marker of mortality. In our study, RDW was an independent, to anemia, prognostic factor for death or rehospitalization.

Study limitations

The sample size of diabetic patients that enrolled in the study was not large (71 patients), albeit every patient not met the study endpoint, had five measurements (admission, discharge, 4, 8 and 12 months). This means that the results should be interpreted under caution and used as a basis for larger studies.

Future directions

Subclinical chronic inflammation is a common feature in the natural course of diabetes and levels of inflammatory biomarkers show promising results regarding this correlation. We strongly believe that the design of larger studies with main focus on "specific" markers of inflammation (such as Leptin, TNF, IL-6, CCL2, Resistin, Adiponectin) and the association with RDW would be of particular importance.

### Red blood cell distribution width: a severity indicator in patients with COVID-19 [^7b093e96]. Journal of Medical Virology (2022). Medium credibility.

Red blood cell distribution width (RDW) was frequently assessed in COVID-19 infection and reported to be associated with adverse outcomes. However, there was no consensus regarding the optimal cutoff value for RDW. Records of 98 patients with COVID-19 from the First People's Hospital of Jingzhou were reviewed. They were divided into two groups according to the cutoff value for RDW on admission by receiver operator characteristic curve analysis: ≤ 11.5% (n = 50) and > 11.5% (n = 48). The association of RDW with the severity and outcomes of COVID-19 was analyzed. The receiver operating characteristic curve indicated that the RDW was a good discrimination factor for identifying COVID-19 severity (area under the curve = 0.728, 95% CI: 0.626–0.830, p < 0.001). Patients with RDW > 11.5% more frequently suffered from critical COVID-19 than those with RDW ≤ 11.5% (62.5% vs. 26.0%, p < 0.001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed RDW to be an independent predictor for critical illness due to COVID-19 (OR = 2.40, 95% CI: 1.27–4.55, p = 0.007). A similar result was obtained when we included RDW > 11.5% into another model instead of RDW as a continuous variable (OR = 5.41, 95% CI: 1.53–19.10, p = 0.009). RDW, as an inexpensive and routinely measured parameter, showed promise as a predictor for critical illness in patients with COVID-19 infection. RDW > 11.5% could be the optimal cutoff to discriminate critical COVID-19 infection.

### Prognostic value of red cell distribution width and mean corpuscular volume on mortality in hemodialysis patients [^058a1ad5]. Seminars in Dialysis (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Anemia is a common consequence of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Red cell distribution width (RDW) and mean corpuscular volume (MCV) are principally used for differential diagnosis of anemia. Limited evidence is available for its prognostic value for mortality in hemodialysis (HD) patients. We aimed to definite the relationship between RDW and MCV and mortality in HD patients.

Method

This cohort study examined all-cause and cardiovascular (CV) mortality with 181 maintenance HD patients from February 2015. Patients were divided into four groups according to the median of RDW and MCV. Pearson analysis was conducted to determine the related factors of RDW and MCV. The independent association of RDW and MCV with mortality was examined with Kaplan-Meier curve and Cox regression analysis.

Results

This study included 181 HD patients for a median follow-up of 71months. We found RDW was positively related to neutrophil count, C-reaction protein, and ferritin, while negatively related to hemoglobin, albumin, and creatinine. Only neutrophil count and ferritin were significantly related to MCV in this study. In the multivariate Cox regression analysis, the high RDW group was associated with higher risk of all-cause mortality (odds ratio, 3.787; 95% confidence interval, 1.037 to 13.834; p = 0.044). The relationship between RDW and MCV and CV mortality was not significant.

Conclusions

RDW could emerge as an additive risk factor for all-cause mortality in maintenance HD patients, independent of other factors. An absolute value of MCV to predict mortality and the underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms should be confirmed in the future.

### Red blood cell distribution width as a predictive marker for coronary artery lesions in patients with Kawasaki disease [^9490bd71]. Pediatric Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Additionally, Kim et al. demonstrated that indicators of iron deficiency anemia, especially ferritin, were highly associated with coronary artery abnormalities. Kuo et al. showed that inflammation-induced hepcidin is associated with anemia development and outcomes in patients with KD. High levels of hepcidin lead to a low serum iron content and limit availability of iron for erythropoiesis, resulting in an increase in RDW. However, no indices reflecting iron metabolism were available in our study; therefore, we were unable to confirm a relationship between RDW and iron metabolism. We found that patients with KD and CALs had a lower mean erythrocyte volume, which may indirectly reflect iron deficiency. Thus, impaired iron mobilization may be a pathophysiological mechanism of the association between increased RDW and CALs.

Nonetheless, several limitations hindered our study. First, this was a retrospective study; therefore, selection bias may exist. Second, due to lack of height data, CALs were assessed according to absolute coronary artery diameter rather than mean BSA-adjusted Z-score. In addition, due to the limited sample size, we did not conduct a subgroup analysis of CAL severity. Third, despite adjusting for multiple variables, it is possible that other residual confounding variables influenced the results, such as iron, folate, and vitamin B12. Finally, although an association between an increase in RDW and presence of CALs in patients with KD was established in the present study, whether RDW has a causal role in CAL development or whether it acts as a marker of the disease process needs further investigation.

### Donor cell leukemia: reappearance of gene mutations in donor cells-more than an incidental phenomenon? [^243e4f54]. Haematologica (2020). Medium credibility.

In both analyzed DCL patients, the red blood cell distribution width (RDW) remained elevated even 9 and 17 years after the transplant (Figure 1). As increased RDW has been reported to be associated with dyserythropoiesis and a poor prognosis in patients with hematologic malignancies, the present study analyzed longitudinal CBC of another 71 allogeneic SCT recipients, recorded in the dataset of Clalit, a health maintenance organization (Online Supplementary Methods). While most CBC parameters, including RDW, gradually normalized in the majority of patients in this cohort over the first 4 years following allogeneic SCT, ~25% of these long-term survivors still exhibited high RDW. This evidence could be suggestive of underlying MDS, or other hematologic pathologies associated with increased RDW, DCL being one of them.

Figure 1.
The variant allele frequency profile and red cell distribution width of two patients with donor cell leukemia that developed long after transplantation for acute myeloid leukemia. RDW: red cell distribution width; Dx: diagnosis; VAF: variant allele frequency; DCL: donor cell leukemia (DCL).

Moreover, in an Italian study including 94 adults with acute leukemia, unfavorable cytogenetics were found in 26% of patients with high RDW compared to 8% of patients with RDW within the normal range (P = 0.10). Additionally, increased RDW was reported among individuals with ARCHand specifically in those at a greater risk of AML development. This change in erythropoiesis might be mediated, at least in part, by an impaired BM microenvironment, although an abnormal crosstalk between cells in the BM and clonal HSPC (ARCH) could also be a possible contributor. While a damaged microenvironment might be involved in both DCL evolution and RDW dynamics, the mechanisms underlying these effects may differ.

### Red cell distribution width is associated with incident myocardial infarction in a general population: the troms ø study [^9c9799fe]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Results

A total of 1779 participants (1080 men and 699 women) experienced a first‐ever MI during a median follow‐up time of 15.8 years. The crude incidence rate was 5.09 (95% CI, 4.85 to 5.33) per 1000 person‐years.

Age at baseline and age‐adjusted baseline characteristics of the study participants across quintiles of RDW are shown in Table 2. Mean age, body mass index, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, serum total cholesterol, prevalence of daily smokers, white blood cells, and platelets increased across increasing RDW quintiles, whereas hemoglobin decreased.

Table 2.
Baseline Characteristics by Quintiles of Red Cell Distribution Width. The Tromsø Study

Baseline characteristics of participants without and with incident MI are shown in Table 3. Participants with MI were older, had higher systolic and diastolic blood pressure, body mass index, total cholesterol, triglycerides, hemoglobin, red and white blood cell counts, and a higher proportion of daily smokers and self‐reported diabetes at baseline. High‐density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations and platelet counts were lower in the MI group. P values were < 0.001 for differences between groups for all variables.

Table 3.
Baseline Characteristics by Development of Myocardial Infarction. The Tromsø Study

When RDW was modeled as a continuous variable, a clear linear dose‐response relationship between RDW and risk of MI was found (Figure). A 1% increment in RDW was associated with a 16% increased risk of MI (HR 1.16; 95% CI, 1.11 to 1.21) after adjustment for age, sex, body mass index, daily smoking, hemoglobin, white blood cells, and platelets (model 2). Further adjustment for hypertension, total cholesterol, triglycerides, diabetes, and red blood cell count (model 3) did not change the risk estimate (HR 1.13; 95% CI 1.07 to 1.19).

### Red blood cell distribution width is an independent risk factor in the prediction of acute respiratory distress syndrome after severe burns [^473309e4]. Burns (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The occurrence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) significantly increases the mortality and morbidity of major burns; there are few laboratory markers that predict the development of ARDS in severe burns. This study was to investigate the relationship between complete blood count (CBC) parameters and the incidence of ARDS in severe burn patients.

Methods

An eight-year retrospective study was performed on 610 severe burn patients who were admitted to the First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University and Rui Jin Hospital of Shanghai Jiao Tong University from January 2008 to December 2015. The patients were divided into two groups based on the development of ARDS. A blood sample was taken at admission and CBC parameters were examined. Univariate logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the risk factors for the development of ARDS.

Results

Of these 610 patients, 143 developed ARDS giving a rate of 23.44%. The percentage of deep second degree and full thickness burn, inhalation injury and red blood cell distribution width (RDW) were independently associated with the development of ARDS in severe burn patients. Every 1% increase in RDW was associated with a 29% increase in the risk to develop ARDS.

Conclusions

The findings of this study suggest that an elevated RDW is associated with an increased risk of ARDS and RDW is an independent risk factor in the prediction of ARDS after severe burns.

### Practical guidance for the management of iron deficiency in patients with inflammatory bowel disease [^14f6dc31]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Complete blood cell count

A CBC for diagnostic evaluation of anemia should include the following cell indices: red blood cell count (RBC), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), reticulocytes count/production index, red cell distribution width (RDW), thrombocyte count and leucocyte count. In order to differentiate between various forms of anemia, the first step is to look at the MCV and MCH to identify macrocytic/normocytic/microcytic anemia. The next step is to evaluate the reticulocyte count and to differentiate between appropriate and inappropriate erythropoiesis. The morphology of red blood cells and the reticulocyte count can help to identify the various causes of anemia, as shown in Table 2.

Table 2.
Causes of anemia and influence on red blood cell morphology and reticulocyte count.

In clinical practice, it has to be considered that multiple causes of anemia can be present in one patient. For example, coexisting IDA and ACD can be microcytic or normocytic. In IDA with concurrent drug-induced anemia (e.g. in the case of treatment with azathioprine), the lab test can be microcytic or even show a macrocytic anemia. This shows that the presence of macrocytic anemia alone should not be mistaken as a reason to exclude iron deficiency. MCH and MCHC are usually decreased in iron deficiency anemia, but are usually normal in ACD.

The RDW shows how much the erythrocytes differentiate in their size. It is commonly increased in IDA and within normal range in thalassemia. However, in patients with IBD, it has to be considered that nutritional deficits and disease activity can also increase the RDW.

Reticulocyte count is reduced (or 'normal', although it should physiologically be upregulated in anemia) in iron deficiency as a sign of inappropriate erythropoiesis. If the reticulocyte count is increased, hemolysis is an important differential diagnosis (lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), bilirubin and haptoglobine are parameters that help to further investigate the presence of hemolysis). The reticulocyte production index (RPI) puts the reticulocyte count in relation to the severity of anemia (RPI = reticulocyte count in % × hematocrit of the patient/ideal hematocrit (= 0.45) × reticulocyte maturation time). As a result of the shorter half-life, reticulocyte indices can reflect changes in the iron homeostasis within 3–10 days, much faster than erythrocyte indices.

### The association between hemoglobin-to-red cell distribution width ratio and asthma and asthma exacerbations: a cross-sectional study [^dc94e031]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Asthma is a common chronic respiratory disease worldwide, characterized by reversible airway constriction and hyperresponsiveness. Analysis of the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) database indicates that in 2019, approximately 262 million people were affected by asthma, with its incidence continuing to rise. One of the most severe consequences of asthma is exacerbation, also known as an asthma attack, which results in a substantial number of emergency department visits. This imposes a significant burden on global healthcare resources and the economy. Therefore, identifying accessible, cost-effective, and highly sensitive biomarkers for asthma and its exacerbations holds significant clinical value.

Complete blood count (CBC) parameters have become valuable tools in asthma research in recent years due to their non-invasive nature, affordability, and accessibility. Among them, eosinophil count is recognized as a key biomarker of asthma-related inflammation, with elevated levels often associated with disease exacerbation and chronic inflammation. However, eosinophil count exhibits limited sensitivity at low levels, restricting its predictive utility across all asthma patients. Additionally, RDW an indicator of erythrocyte volume heterogeneity, has been linked to systemic inflammation and hypoxic conditions. Recent studies have demonstrated its association with the prevalence and mortality of several inflammatory diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), rheumatic diseases, sepsis, and heart failure. Similarly, hemoglobin (HGB) primarily functions as an oxygen transport molecule and is widely used as a key biochemical marker for diagnosing anemia.

The HRR is an innovative composite biomarker that integrates HGB and RDW, providing comprehensive information on oxygen transport and inflammation. HRR was initially introduced in cancer research, and has since been demonstrated to be associated with various diseases, including cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, offering greater comprehensiveness and reliability compared to HGB or RDW alone. HRR is influenced by both its components: hemoglobin levels can be altered by anemia, chronic disease, nutritional deficiencies, or hypoxia, while RDW tends to increase under conditions of systemic inflammation, oxidative stress, or disrupted erythropoiesis. These factors make HRR a composite marker that captures both oxygen transport capacity and systemic inflammatory burden. Compared to RDW or HGB alone, HRR may offer improved stability and interpretability in reflecting chronic inflammatory conditions. Therefore, HRR may serve as an integrative marker reflecting both oxygen delivery and inflammatory burden.

Given the complex pathological characteristics of asthma and the interplay between systemic inflammation and hypoxia, we hypothesize that HRR may serve as a potential biomarker for assessing disease status in asthma patients. This study aims to analyze the relationship between HRR, asthma, and asthma exacerbations.

### Association of red blood cell distribution width with mortality risk in hospitalized adults with SARS-CoV-2 infection [^5c6f4edf]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Figure 2.
Cox Proportional Hazards Modeling of Mortality Risk

Models of mortality adjusted for age, race, ethnicity, red blood cell distribution width (RDW), absolute lymphocyte count, and D-dimer (dimerized plasmin fragment D) level are given for the multivariate (A) and univariate (B) analyses. Variables were coded as either continuous (A and B) or discrete (C and D) using the following thresholds: age older than 70 years, RDW > 14.5%, lymphocyte count < 0.8 × 10⁹/L, and D-dimer level greater than 1500 ng/L, which provided similar proportions of abnormality in the cohort (33%, 29%, 27%, and 28%, respectively, for age, RDW, lymphocyte count, and D-dimer level). Race was coded as 1 for Black/African American, and 0 for all other groups. Ethnicity was coded as 1 for Hispanic, and 0 for non-Hispanic/unknown. For continuous models, changes in variables were normalized as follows: age increase of 10 years, RDW increase of 0.5%, D-dimer level increase of 100 ng/L, and a lymphocyte count decrease of 0.1 103 × 10⁹/L.

### The application value of mean red blood cell volume and red blood cell volume distribution width combined with total serum bilirubin in the early screening of neonatal hemolytic disease [^96964ae2]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

MCV and RDW are traditionally used in the differential diagnosis and treatment of anemia. Recent studies have also found that MCV and RDW are related to the infection process, and RDW was found to be related to a variety of diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, kidney disease, etc. In this study, the TSB, MCV and RDW-CV were independent factors that increased the early detection rate of HDN. The early measurement of MCV and RDW-CV was valuable for improving the detection rate of HDN. The AUC for each index was greater than 0.600. Combined with the TSB (with an AUC of 0.729) for screening HDN, the AUC was 0.841. Joint monitoring could increase the detection rate of early HDN compared with a single index. Although the specificity of each index was not high, the sensitivity was good, and the early value was increased. Contrary to the developmental process of TSB, they complement each other for observation. Therefore, MCV and RDW-CV can be used as early screening indicators, and combined with TSB, has application value in the early screening of the cause of jaundice.

### Red blood cell distribution width as a predictive marker for coronary artery lesions in patients with Kawasaki disease [^8eb517b6]. Pediatric Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Red cell distribution width (RDW), which is a marker of variation in the size of circulating erythrocytes (anisocytosis), is routinely measured in clinical practice as part of the complete blood count (CBC). Traditionally, RDW is used in the differential diagnosis of anemia. In 2007, Felker et al. first discovered that an increase in RDW is an independent predictor of morbidity and mortality in patients with chronic heart failure. Growing interest has been expressed in the clinical value of RDW. An increasing number of studies have demonstrated that a higher RDW is a prognostic factor for various cardiovascular system diseases, such as coronary artery disease, hypertension, heart failure, peripheral artery disease, coronary artery ectasia, and congenital heart disease. However, studies on the relationship between RDW and CALs in patients with KD are limited, and these studies mainly focus on the RDW coefficient of variation (RDW-CV). RDW-CV is calculated by dividing the standard deviation (SD) of red blood cell (RBC) volume by mean erythrocyte volume and multiplying by 100% to express the result as a percentage. Because information might be lost by expressing RDW relative to MCV, Hoffmann et al. proposed that future studies on the prognostic value of RDW should focus on RDW-SD. Tonelli et al. suggested that RDW-SD may be more useful as a prognostic marker than RDW-CV in the general population. Therefore, in the present study, we aimed to investigate the relationship between RDW, including RDW-CV and RDW-SD, and CALs in patients with KD.

### Role of red cell distribution width, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and interleukin-6 in immunoglobulin a vasculitis nephritis among tibetan children in high-altitude areas [^02c3c4a1]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical studies and animal experiments showed elevated serum TNF-α and IL-6 expression in acute IgAV, and these cytokines can stimulate glomerular mesangial cells, inducing functional and morphologic changes. Yuan et al. further confirmed serum TNF-α and IL-8 levels correlate with IgAVN; TNF-α may trigger inflammation, promoting IL-8 release and cell adhesion molecule expression, which recruits neutrophils to vascular inflammation sites, causing vascular endothelial damage and inflammatory response.

Red cell distribution width (RDW) is a classic indicator for measuring red blood cell (RBC) size changes in blood reports, usually for anemia diagnosis/differential diagnosis. Recent studies identified RBC size heterogeneity as a marker for increased mortality/morbidity and a prognostic assessment tool for diseases. Inflammatory cytokines (e.g. TNF-α, IL-6) may inhibit erythropoietin (EPO) production, affecting erythropoiesis; reduced erythropoiesis (due to increased immature RBC count) leads to elevated RDW.

In our study, RDW, TNF-α, and IL-6 were significantly higher in IgAV children with renal involvement than those without. Elevated RDW, TNF-α, and IL-6 were risk factors for IgAVN in high-altitude Tibetan children, with a positive correlation among the three — consistent with prior findings. Higher pro-inflammatory cytokine plasma concentrations exert greater impacts on erythropoiesis; RDW correlates positively with TNF-α/IL-6, and elevated RDW links to inflammatory response and disease activity. Early prediction of kidney injury matters for IgAVN individualized treatment and prognostic assessment; RDW can serve as an independent prognostic indicator for severe acute kidney injury, with higher RDW associated with increased mortality risk. However, different pediatric clinical characteristics may cause inconsistent results in RDW-TNF-α correlation.

### Red cell distribution width as a potential new biomarker to predict the clinical severity of acute diverticulitis [^3b95f303]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Despite the high patient count and broad inclusion of subjects, the results have limited generalizability particularly to different Hinchey classes, as we were able to analyze only two groups based on this classification (class I versus class II-IV). The retrospective design limits the reliability of some data that were based on hospital records (in spite of the fact that these were electronic records) and retrospective analysis precludes the inclusion of additional biomarkers, clinical variables, and long-term outcomes such as recurrence, complications, and mortality. If a group of patients with diverticulosis had been included, the results of patients with diverticulitis could have been compared to these patients to understand the variations between these groups and the utility of examined parameters in distinguishing cases. Potential confounders that could affect RDW levels, such as iron deficiency, anemia, chronic diseases, malnutrition or other factors, were not evaluated. While we excluded patients with known comorbidities, we did not have access to laboratory data on iron status, renal function, or nutritional markers — all of which may affect RDW. This limitation should be kept in mind when interpreting our results. The exclusion of these factors may represent a limitation in the interpretation of the results. Additionally, the considerable differences in patient numbers between treatment groups may have affected the reliability of statistical comparisons in this regard. Additionally, since this study only included patients with confirmed diverticulitis, we were not able to compare RDW levels to those of a healthy or non-diverticulitis population. This limits our ability to define a general reference range or threshold for RDW in broader clinical settings.
