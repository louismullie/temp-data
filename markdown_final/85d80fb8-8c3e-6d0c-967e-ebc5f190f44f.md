## Question

How many cholesterol a day

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how much dietary cholesterol per day is recommended. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the historical numeric limits and why they changed. Then, I should verify the current consensus on whether a specific daily target exists. Next, I will examine dose–response effects of dietary cholesterol on LDL-C and consider interindividual variability. After that, I should stratify recommendations by risk category, including the general population, high-risk groups, and special populations like children and those with diabetes. Finally, I will translate this into practical, food-based guidance and summarize a cautious, clinically actionable answer with caveats and monitoring advice.

> Let me first confirm the historical context. Older guidance commonly cited 300 mg/day for healthy adults, with more restrictive targets of 200 mg/day for those with elevated LDL-C or high cardiovascular risk, and pediatric guidance often capped at 300 mg/day with 200 mg/day for children with dyslipidemia, reflecting concerns about modest LDL-C raising effects of dietary cholesterol and the desire to lower atherogenic lipoproteins in at-risk populations [^ffbc1be3] [^82584d1b] [^c7a4b63c].

> Wait, let me verify the current stance before jumping ahead. Contemporary guidelines de-emphasize a rigid numeric cholesterol target because the average LDL-C rise from dietary cholesterol is modest, there is substantial interindividual variability in response, and the totality of evidence linking dietary cholesterol to cardiovascular outcomes is inconsistent; instead, guidance focuses on overall dietary patterns that are naturally lower in cholesterol and saturated fat, such as Mediterranean and DASH-style eating patterns, with the AHA advising to keep cholesterol as low as possible within a healthy eating pattern rather than specifying a milligram limit [^84db590a] [^8925131b] [^785be278].

> I need to check the magnitude of LDL-C effects to calibrate risk. Controlled feeding trials and meta-analyses show that each additional 100 mg/day of dietary cholesterol increases LDL-C by about 1.5–2.0 mg/dL on average, with nonlinear dose–response and wide individual variability; some people are hypo-responders with minimal change, while others are hyper-responders with larger LDL-C increases, which is why personalized approaches are reasonable when LDL-C is high or responsiveness is suspected [^55bbcbf5] [^7e1f9985] [^6e0706d7].

> Hold on, I should verify how this translates into practical guidance for the general population. For most healthy adults, the emphasis is on adopting a cardioprotective pattern that is low in saturated fat and naturally low in dietary cholesterol, typically in the 100–300 mg/day range within current U.S. intake patterns; within such patterns, occasional egg consumption is generally acceptable, and the AHA supports about one whole egg per day in healthy individuals with normal cholesterol, while acknowledging that the cholesterol is in the yolk and that saturated fat intake should remain the priority target [^b1579aec] [^84db590a] [^5cbd7ab5].

> Let me consider high-risk groups more carefully. For adults with elevated LDL-C, clinical ASCVD, or diabetes, many lipid specialists advise a more restrictive cholesterol intake, often aiming for less than 200 mg/day, because even modest LDL-C increases from dietary cholesterol can be clinically meaningful when baseline atherogenic lipoproteins are high; the National Lipid Association explicitly recommends limiting cholesterol to less than 200 mg/day in dyslipidemia management and notes that further reductions may be considered in hyper-responders, while the ACC/AHA guideline supports a diet with reduced cholesterol as part of risk reduction [^928963f6] [^fb0eb694] [^8925131b].

> I should double-check special populations. In children and adolescents, pediatric guidance continues to support limiting dietary cholesterol to less than 300 mg/day for healthy children and less than 200 mg/day for those with elevated LDL-C, with randomized trials showing that structured counseling can safely reduce intake and lower LDL-C without adverse effects on growth or development; for women of reproductive potential with dyslipidemia, expert consensus similarly recommends 200–300 mg/day of dietary cholesterol within a heart-healthy pattern [^82584d1b] [^c7a4b63c] [^6eff2bf4].

> But wait, what about diabetes and other metabolic conditions. Observational data suggest that higher dietary cholesterol and egg intake may associate with increased cardiovascular risk in people with diabetes, so a more conservative cholesterol intake, often less than 200 mg/day, is reasonable in diabetes alongside tighter saturated fat restriction; mechanistic and translational work also highlights postprandial effects of cholesterol- and saturated fat–rich meals that may promote endothelial dysfunction and inflammation, reinforcing caution in high-risk phenotypes [^fd97684e] [^db9f883c].

> Let me translate this into food-based guidance. I should confirm that the practical message is to prioritize plant-forward patterns with fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, seeds, and liquid plant oils, choose lean proteins and low-fat or fat-free dairy, limit processed and red meats, and minimize sources high in both cholesterol and saturated fat such as fatty cuts of meat, full-fat dairy, and processed foods; eggs can be included in moderation, with many guidelines supporting up to one per day in healthy adults, while those with high LDL-C or diabetes may limit yolks or use egg whites more often [^84db590a] [^8925131b] [^5cbd7ab5].

> I should confirm monitoring and individualization. Because response to dietary cholesterol varies, checking a fasting lipid panel 4–12 weeks after a major dietary change is sensible, especially in people with elevated LDL-C or on lipid-lowering therapy; if LDL-C rises disproportionately with added dietary cholesterol, further restriction is reasonable, whereas minimal change supports maintaining the current pattern with emphasis on saturated fat and overall diet quality [^f7af738a].

> Putting this together, I need to ensure the bottom line is clear and clinically actionable. There is no universally mandated daily cholesterol limit for all adults; current guidance favors keeping dietary cholesterol as low as possible within a healthy, low–saturated fat dietary pattern, which typically lands around 100–300 mg/day for most people, with a stricter target of less than 200 mg/day for those with elevated LDL-C, clinical ASCVD, diabetes, or hyper-responsiveness to dietary cholesterol, and pediatric targets of less than 300 mg/day generally and less than 200 mg/day for children with dyslipidemia, all while prioritizing whole-food patterns and periodic lipid monitoring to individualize advice [^84db590a] [^b1579aec] [^928963f6] [^82584d1b].

The bottom line is that **most healthy adults should aim for less than 300 mg of dietary cholesterol per day** [^ffbc1be3], while those with high LDL cholesterol, diabetes, or cardiovascular disease should limit intake to **less than 200 mg per day** [^928963f6] [^fb0eb694]. Current guidelines emphasize **dietary patterns** low in saturated fat and cholesterol [^8925131b] [^785be278], rather than strict numeric limits, because dietary cholesterol has a modest effect on blood cholesterol and individual responses vary [^55bbcbf5] [^36347563]. Eggs can be included in moderation (about 1 per day) [^5cbd7ab5] if overall saturated fat and cholesterol intake remain low [^84db590a].

## Historical dietary cholesterol recommendations

Historically, dietary guidelines recommended **limiting cholesterol intake to less than 300 mg per day** for healthy adults [^ffbc1be3], and to less than 200 mg per day for individuals with high LDL cholesterol, diabetes, or cardiovascular disease [^928963f6]. These recommendations were based on evidence that dietary cholesterol could modestly increase LDL cholesterol levels [^c28f6fb9] [^55bbcbf5], thereby potentially increasing cardiovascular risk [^fd97684e].

---

## Current dietary guidelines and scientific consensus

Recent guidelines have shifted away from strict numeric cholesterol limits, emphasizing **overall dietary patterns** [^84db590a] rather than specific cholesterol targets. The 2015–2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans removed the specific 300 mg/day limit, stating that cholesterol is "not a nutrient of concern for overconsumption" [^90df7490]. This change reflects evolving evidence that dietary cholesterol has a relatively modest effect on blood cholesterol levels compared to saturated and trans fats [^55bbcbf5] [^36347563].

---

## Evidence on dietary cholesterol and cardiovascular risk

- **Modest LDL increase**: Dietary cholesterol can modestly increase LDL cholesterol levels, but the effect is generally small and varies among individuals [^55bbcbf5] [^7e1f9985].
- **Individual variability**: Some individuals are "hyper-responders" to dietary cholesterol, experiencing larger increases in LDL cholesterol levels [^36347563] [^6e0706d7].
- **Cardiovascular risk**: Observational studies have shown mixed results regarding the association between dietary cholesterol intake and cardiovascular disease risk [^c28f6fb9] [^f6129304]. Some studies suggest no significant association, while others indicate a modest increase in risk, particularly at high intake levels [^1782a29e] [^e103be33].

## Current recommendations by health organizations

| **Health organization** | **Current recommendation** |
|-|-|
| American Heart Association (AHA) | Emphasizes healthy dietary patterns (e.g. Mediterranean, DASH) that are inherently low in cholesterol. No specific numeric limit, but advises keeping cholesterol intake as low as possible within a healthy diet [^84db590a] [^8925131b]. |
| American College of Cardiology (ACC) | Recommends dietary patterns low in saturated fat and cholesterol, without specifying a numeric limit [^8925131b] [^785be278]. |
| National Lipid Association (NLA) | Recommends limiting cholesterol intake to less than 200 mg per day for individuals with high LDL cholesterol, diabetes, or cardiovascular disease [^928963f6] [^fb0eb694]. |

---

## Practical dietary advice

- **Limit high-cholesterol foods**: Reduce intake of foods high in cholesterol, such as organ meats, full-fat dairy products, and egg yolks [^d60f2a33].
- **Focus on dietary patterns**: Emphasize plant-based foods, whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and lean proteins [^8925131b] [^785be278].
- **Moderate egg consumption**: Eggs can be included in moderation (approximately one per day) if overall saturated fat and cholesterol intake remain low [^5cbd7ab5] [^84db590a].
- **Monitor individual response**: Individuals with high LDL cholesterol, diabetes, or cardiovascular disease should monitor their lipid levels and adjust dietary cholesterol intake accordingly [^928963f6] [^fb0eb694].

---

## Special considerations

Certain populations require **more stringent cholesterol intake limits**. Individuals with familial hypercholesterolemia or other genetic disorders affecting cholesterol metabolism should strictly limit dietary cholesterol [^b85ff2c3]. Patients with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or high LDL cholesterol levels should also adhere to lower cholesterol intake limits (less than 200 mg per day) [^928963f6] [^fb0eb694].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

- **General population**: Aim for less than 300 mg of dietary cholesterol per day [^ffbc1be3].
- **High-risk individuals**: Limit cholesterol intake to less than 200 mg per day [^928963f6] [^fb0eb694].
- **Emphasize dietary patterns**: Focus on overall dietary patterns low in saturated fat and cholesterol, rather than strict numeric limits [^84db590a] [^8925131b].
- **Individualized approach**: Monitor lipid levels and adjust dietary cholesterol intake based on individual response and risk factors [^f7af738a] [^36347563].

---

Current guidelines emphasize **dietary patterns** low in saturated fat and cholesterol [^8925131b], with a general recommendation of less than 300 mg per day for healthy adults and less than 200 mg per day for high-risk individuals [^928963f6]. Individual responses vary, so personalized dietary adjustments and lipid monitoring are essential [^f7af738a].

### Dietary cholesterol and cardiovascular risk: a science advisory from the American Heart Association [^84db590a]. Circulation (2020). Medium credibility.

The elimination of specific dietary cholesterol target recommendations in recent guidelines has raised questions about its role with respect to cardiovascular disease. This advisory was developed after a review of human studies on the relationship of dietary cholesterol with blood lipids, lipoproteins, and cardiovascular disease risk to address questions about the relevance of dietary cholesterol guidance for heart health. Evidence from observational studies conducted in several countries generally does not indicate a significant association with cardiovascular disease risk. Although meta-analyses of intervention studies differ in their findings, most associate intakes of cholesterol that exceed current average levels with elevated total or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations. Dietary guidance should focus on healthy dietary patterns (eg, Mediterranean-style and DASH [Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension]-style diets) that are inherently relatively low in cholesterol with typical levels similar to the current US intake. These patterns emphasize fruits, vegetables, whole grains, low-fat or fat-free dairy products, lean protein sources, nuts, seeds, and liquid vegetable oils. A recommendation that gives a specific dietary cholesterol target within the context of food-based advice is challenging for clinicians and consumers to implement; hence, guidance focused on dietary patterns is more likely to improve diet quality and to promote cardiovascular health.

The most recent 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee report indicated that "cholesterol is not considered a nutrient of concern for overconsumption". However, this statement may be too general as it does not acknowledge conflicting findings in literature regarding cardiovascular risk in certain populations. Current research suggests that dietary cholesterol may increase an subject's risk of developing diabetes, increases a diabetic patient's risk of cardiovascular disease, and may worsen coronary risk factors in subjects who are "hyper-responders" to dietary cholesterol. In conclusion, we suggest that a more cautious approach to dietary cholesterol intake is warranted, especially in high-risk populations.

Dietary cholesterol — guideline limits and positions — state that the 2010 US Dietary Guidelines recommended dietary cholesterol be < 300 mg per day for healthy individuals ages 2 years and older; the American Heart Association (AHA) in 2006 recommended < 300 mg per day and in 2011 recommended < 150 mg per day for the prevention of CVD in women; the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) III recommended < 200 mg/day as part of the Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes diet; the 2013 AHA/ACC Guideline did not make a recommendation because there was "insufficient evidence to determine whether lowering dietary cholesterol reduces LDL-C"; and the 2015 DGAC did not recommend continuation of the < 300 mg per day limit because "available evidence shows no appreciable relationship between consumption of dietary cholesterol and serum cholesterol".

Dietary cholesterol intake — pediatric guidance and prevalence: There is no dietary requirement for cholesterol. The 1992 National Cholesterol Education Program report recommended limiting intake to < 300 mg/d in all children and to < 200 mg/d in those with elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL–C). In NHANES, males aged 12–19 years had mean intake of 335 mg/d, exceeding 300 mg/d. This evidence review identified 15 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) addressing dietary cholesterol in infancy, childhood, and adolescence.

### Dietary intakes of eggs and cholesterol in relation to all-cause and heart disease mortality: a prospective cohort study [^5cbd7ab5]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Eggs are a major dietary source of cholesterol in daily life. In addition to cholesterol, they contain high‐quality protein and several vitamins and minerals. 1 Although they are affordable and nutrient‐dense, there are concerns over potential cardiovascular comlications associated with high dietary intake of eggs because of the high level of dietary cholesterol in eggs that may lead to worsening of blood cholesterol levels. For decades, it has been advised to restrict consumption of eggs, particularly yolk, but further evidence indicated that eggs were not significantly associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes. 2, 3, 4

The 2015–2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommended egg consumption as part of a healthy diet, and abolished the limit of dietary cholesterol intake of 300 mg/day 2 that has been in the American dietary guidelines since 1968. 5 The updated recommendation is based on evidence from some major meta‐analyses of observational studies that reported no significant associations between egg consumption, up to 1 per day, and risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) or coronary heart disease. 6, 7, 8 A possible protective association with stroke was even reported. 9 Accordingly, the latest science advisory from the American Heart Association supported daily consumption of 1 whole egg in healthy individuals with normal cholesterol level. 10 In contrast, in early 2019, a pooled analysis of 6 US prospective cohorts reported positive associations between dietary intakes of egg and cholesterol and risk of incident CVD and all‐cause mortality. 11 The reasons for the discrepancy between this study and earlier meta‐analyses are unclear, although it is possible that higher risk may only become apparent at higher doses: the average dietary cholesterol intake was 293 mg/day in US adults in 2013–2014, 12 much higher than the global average of 228 mg/day. 13 In addition, the pooled analysis was based on 6 heterogeneous cohorts with substantial differences in baseline characteristics of participants, and generalizability of these findings to the overall US population is unclear. Since the publication of that article, results from several other cohort studies were published and the inconsistent findings further contributed to the ongoing debates on the relationship between dietary eggs and cholesterol and CVD. 14, 15, 16, 17 Nevertheless, a comprehensive assessment of the associations in a cohort of US representative population is still needed and may provide valuable evidence for establishment of a general dietary guideline for adults.

### Expert panel on integrated guidelines for cardiovascular health and risk reduction in children and adolescents: summary report [^9e65a1b5]. PES (2012). Medium credibility.

Overview of the evidence for dietary cholesterol intake — children and adolescents: In adults on a 2,500 kcal/d diet, serum cholesterol decreases by about 4 mg/dL for every 100 mg/d decrease in dietary cholesterol, and recommendations limited dietary cholesterol to < 300 mg/d in all children and to < 200 mg/d in those with elevated LDL–C; however, among males ages 12–19 years mean intake was 335 mg/d, exceeding the recommended 300 mg/d. This evidence review identified 15 RCTs, including the STRIP trial, which enrolled 1,062 healthy infants randomized beginning at age 7 months and provided counseling to maintain dietary cholesterol < 200 mg/d; from age 13 months onward the intervention group consumed less fat and cholesterol with lower TC and LDL–C levels, with the difference in LDL–C levels after age 7 years significant only among boys, and no harmful effects on growth, micronutrient intake, development, or neurologic function.

### Dietary cholesterol and cardiovascular disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^c28f6fb9]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Dietary cholesterol has been suggested to increase the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), which has led to US recommendations to reduce cholesterol intake.

Objective

The authors examine the effects of dietary cholesterol on CVD risk in healthy adults by using systematic review and meta-analysis.

Design

MEDLINE, Cochrane Central, and Commonwealth Agricultural Bureau Abstracts databases were searched through December 2013 for prospective studies that quantified dietary cholesterol. Investigators independently screened citations and verified extracted data on study and participant characteristics, outcomes, and quality. Random-effect models meta-analysis was used when at least 3 studies reported the same CVD outcome.

Results

Forty studies (17 cohorts in 19 publications with 361,923 subjects and 19 trials in 21 publications with 632 subjects) published between 1979 and 2013 were eligible for review. Dietary cholesterol was not statistically significantly associated with any coronary artery disease (4 cohorts; no summary RR), ischemic stroke (4 cohorts; summary RR: 1.13; 95% CI: 0.99, 1.28), or hemorrhagic stroke (3 cohorts; summary RR: 1.09; 95% CI: 0.79, 1.50). Dietary cholesterol statistically significantly increased both serum total cholesterol (17 trials; net change: 11.2 mg/dL; 95% CI: 6.4, 15.9) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (14 trials; net change: 6.7 mg/dL; 95% CI: 1.7, 11.7 mg/dL). Increases in LDL cholesterol were no longer statistically significant when intervention doses exceeded 900 mg/d. Dietary cholesterol also statistically significantly increased serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (13 trials; net change: 3.2 mg/dL; 95% CI: 0.9, 9.7 mg/dL) and the LDL to high-density lipoprotein ratio (5 trials; net change: 0.2; 95% CI: 0.0, 0.3). Dietary cholesterol did not statistically significantly change serum triglycerides or very-low-density lipoprotein concentrations.

Conclusion

Reviewed studies were heterogeneous and lacked the methodologic rigor to draw any conclusions regarding the effects of dietary cholesterol on CVD risk. Carefully adjusted and well-conducted cohort studies would be useful to identify the relative effects of dietary cholesterol on CVD risk.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 2 [^36347563]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

NLA Expert Panel — dietary cholesterol effects and practical implications: Dietary cholesterol has modest effects to increase total cholesterol (total-C) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) on average, with hypo- and hyper-responders, and within the context of current intake levels effects appear limited to population subgroups, for whom "restrictions in dietary cholesterol intake are likely warranted." Prediction tools are lacking, as "there is no widely available and inexpensive method for clinical use to predict who is likely to experience a change in atherogenic cholesterol." For most individuals, "restricting saturated fat intake to < 7% of energy" lowers dietary cholesterol intake, and some foods are high in cholesterol but not saturated fat, including "eggs, shrimp and other shellfish, and some organ meats."

Dietary cholesterol — systematic review/meta-analysis by Berger et al. — found that in 17 of 19 trials, dietary cholesterol with intervention intake 501 to 1415 mg/day versus 0 to 415 mg/day in controls significantly increased serum total-C by 11.2 mg/dL and LDL-C by 6.7 mg/dL; when intervention intake levels were greater than 900 mg/day, there were no longer statistically significant increases in LDL-C; HDL-C also increased 3.2 mg/dL. Contextually, the review spanned 40 studies, including 17 cohort studies and 19 trials.

### Cholesterol myths and facts… [^efc9f17f]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Myth: All cholesterol is bad for you. Fact: Some types of cholesterol are essential for good health. Your body needs cholesterol to perform important jobs, such as making hormones and building cells. Cholesterol travels through the blood on proteins called lipoproteins. Two types of lipoproteins carry cholesterol throughout the body: low-density lipoprotein, sometimes called "bad" cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein, or "good" cholesterol. When your body has too much LDL cholesterol, it can build up in the walls of your blood vessels. This buildup is called plaque. HDL, or "good" cholesterol, carries cholesterol back to the liver. The liver then flushes it from the body. High levels of HDL cholesterol can lower your risk for heart disease and stroke. As your blood vessels build up plaque over time, the insides of the vessels narrow. This narrowing can restrict and eventually block blood flow to and from your heart and other organs.

When blood flow to the heart is blocked, it can cause angina or a heart attack. Myth: Eating foods with a lot of cholesterol will not make my cholesterol levels go up. Fact: It can be complicated. We know that foods with a lot of cholesterol usually also have a lot of saturated fat. Saturated fats can make your cholesterol numbers higher, so it's best to choose foods that are lower in saturated fats. Foods made from animals, including red meat, butter, and cheese, have a lot of saturated fats. Instead, aim to eat foods with plenty of fiber, such as oatmeal and beans. Healthy unsaturated fats, such as avocados, olive oil, and nuts are also recommended. Myth: I can't do anything to change my cholesterol levels. Fact: You can do many things to improve your cholesterol levels and keep them in a healthy range. Get tested at least every 5 years. Learn more about cholesterol screenings. Make healthy food choices.

Limit foods high in saturated fats. Choose foods naturally high in fiber and unsaturated fats. Learn more about healthy diets and nutrition at CDC's Nutrition website. Be active every day.

### Nutrition interventions for adults with dyslipidemia: a clinical perspective from the National Lipid Association [^55bbcbf5]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2023). High credibility.

Dietary cholesterol — An increase of 100 mg/day in dietary cholesterol has been reported to increase LDL-C by ~1.5–2.0 mg/dL, although the relationship may be non-linear and there appears to be substantial inter-individual variation in sensitivity to dietary cholesterol.

### Evidence from randomised controlled trials does not support current dietary fat guidelines: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^d8d812b9]. Open Heart (2016). Low credibility.

Review of dietary guidelines

The US dietary guidelines advisory committee (DGAC) report was published in February 2015. The recommendation to limit dietary cholesterol intake to 300 mg a day has prevailed in the USA since 1977. The DGAC stated that they will not bring forward this recommendation, because available evidence shows no appreciable relationship between consumption of dietary cholesterol and serum cholesterol. The UK did not introduce dietary cholesterol targets in the original guidelinesand they have not been introduced since.

The DGAC advice demonstrated further movement away from the original dietary guidelines by containing no total fat recommendation and a change in position on dietary fat and CVD. The advisory report documented the findings of the meta-analyses by Skeaff, Siri-Tarino, Hooperand Chowdhury, and concluded that reducing total fat does not lower CVD risk. The SFA guideline was reiterated, however, with the recommendation to consume < 10% of total calories from SFA per day.

The UK does not review dietary guidelines at regular intervals. The target for total fat remains 30% of daily total energy intake and 10% for SFA.

Dietary fat guidelines were introduced with the intention of reducing CHD mortality. No meta-analysis has found any significant difference for dietary fat interventions and all-cause mortality or deaths from CHD. All but one studyis of single-sex and/or secondary prevention subjects. Even in men who have already suffered a myocardial infarction, evidence does not support dietary recommendations; yet they have been issued for millions of citizens for three to four decades.

The most recent meta-analysis, with the same single-sex, secondary prevention limitations, suggested that there may be a small reduction in cardiovascular risk on reduction of SFA intake. It was further suggested that replacing the energy from SFA with polyunsaturated fat appeared to be a useful strategy, while replacement with carbohydrate appeared less useful and replacement with monounsaturated fat unclear. Of the 11 interventions contributing to this conclusion, only one documented both SFA reduction and reported that this was mainly replaced with polyunsaturated fat.

General principles for a healthy lifestyle — Recommended macronutrient ranges for adults are 45–65% of energy from carbohydrate, 10–35% from protein, and 20–35% of energy from fat, and the 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee's Scientific Report recommended removal of the upper limit for dietary fat to allow greater flexibility, particularly with regard to reducing intakes of cholesterol-raising (12–16 carbon saturated and trans unsaturated) fatty acids and refined grains and sugars.

### Efficacy of aerobic exercise and a prudent diet for improving selected lipids and lipoproteins in adults: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^b8dfa7a7]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

For daily nutrition intake, statistically significant intervention minus control reductions were observed for total kilocalories, percentage of kilocalories from total fat, percentage of kilocalories from saturated fat, and daily cholesterol consumption. In addition, there was a statistically significant increase in the percentage of carbohydrates consumed. Across all studies, changes were equivalent to intervention minus control improvements of 14.9%, 12.0%, 23.1%, 34.7% and 42.1% respectively, for total kilocalories, carbohydrates, total fat, saturated fat and cholesterol. With the exception of prediction intervals for cholesterol intake, statistically significant heterogeneity and inconsistency as well as overlapping prediction intervals were observed for all nutrition outcomes.

Greater reductions in dietary outcomes were associated with studies that recommended lower caloric intake for total kilocalories (β 1, -310, 95% CI, -475, -146) and percentage of carbohydrates (β 1, -3.0, 95% CI, -5.7, -0.3) but not for percentage of total fat (β 1, -0.4, 95% CI, -2.8, 2.0), percentage of saturated fat (β 1, 0.05, 95% CI, -0.9, 1.0) or cholesterol consumed (β 1, -.45.9, 95% CI, -104.9, 12.5). In addition, there were no statistically significant associations between changes in dietary outcomes and gender (total kilocalories, β 1, 179.1, 95% CI, -149, 507; percentage of total fat, β 1, 0.9, 95% CI, -3.8, 5.6; percentage of saturated fat, β 1, -0.7, 95% CI, -1.7, 0.3; cholesterol β 1, -41.0, 95% CI, -108.8, 26.9; percentage of carbohydrates β 1, -.1.1 95% CI, -6.9, 4.7).

### Nutrition interventions for youth with dyslipidemia: a National Lipid Association clinical perspective [^fb0eb694]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2022). High credibility.

Dietary cholesterol — In 2015, the NLA recommended a dietary pattern containing reduced amounts of cholesterol (< 200 mg/day) to decrease LDL-C and non-HDL-C, especially for persons at high risk for CVD or with diabetes; heart-healthy dietary patterns are typically low in dietary cholesterol because they are low in animal products rich in SFA; choosing plant-based protein sources also limits cholesterol intake.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 2 [^fd97684e]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Dietary cholesterol — LDL-C effects and ASCVD risk context are described as follows: In controlled feeding randomized controlled trials (RCTs), each 100 mg/day of dietary cholesterol raises low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) by an average of ~1.9 mg/dL, while observational data report no association between dietary cholesterol or egg consumption and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk in the general population but suggest increased ASCVD risk with greater cholesterol and egg consumption in those with diabetes mellitus; accordingly, the NLA Expert Panel bases recommendations mainly on controlled-feeding RCTs showing modest effects of dietary cholesterol to raise total-C and LDL-C, recognizing that other dietary factors more reliably influence atherogenic cholesterol levels.

### Public health guidelines should recommend reducing saturated fat consumption as much as possible: debate consensus [^471334a0]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2020). Medium credibility.

There is ongoing debate as to whether public health guidelines should advocate reducing SFA consumption as much as possible to reduce the risk of chronic diseases, especially cardiovascular disease (CVD). In considering both sides of this question, we identified a number of points of agreement, most notably that the overall dietary patterns in which SFAs are consumed are of greater significance for cardiometabolic and general health than SFA intake alone. Nevertheless, there remained significant disagreements, centered largely on the interpretation of evidence bearing on 4 major questions: 1) does reducing dietary SFAs lower the incidence of CVD, 2) is the LDL-cholesterol reduction with lower SFA intake predictive of reduced CVD risk, 3) do dietary SFAs affect factors other than LDL cholesterol that may impact CVD risk, and 4) is there a sufficient rationale for setting a target for maximally reducing dietary SFAs? Finally, we identified specific research needs for addressing knowledge gaps that have contributed to the controversies.

### Diet and lifestyle recommendations revision 2006: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association nutrition committee [^90896c36]. Circulation (2006). Low credibility.

Improving diet and lifestyle is a critical component of the American Heart Association's strategy for cardiovascular disease risk reduction in the general population. This document presents recommendations designed to meet this objective. Specific goals are to consume an overall healthy diet; aim for a healthy body weight; aim for recommended levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides; aim for normal blood pressure; aim for a normal blood glucose level; be physically active; and avoid use of and exposure to tobacco products. The recommendations are to balance caloric intake and physical activity to achieve and maintain a healthy body weight; consume a diet rich in vegetables and fruits; choose whole-grain, high-fiber foods; consume fish, especially oily fish, at least twice a week; limit intake of saturated fat to < 7% of energy, trans fat to < 1% of energy, and cholesterol to < 300 mg/day by choosing lean meats and vegetable alternatives, fat-free (skim) or low-fat (1% fat) dairy products and minimize intake of partially hydrogenated fats; minimize intake of beverages and foods with added sugars; choose and prepare foods with little or no salt; if you consume alcohol, do so in moderation; and when you eat food prepared outside of the home, follow these Diet and Lifestyle Recommendations. By adhering to these diet and lifestyle recommendations, Americans can substantially reduce their risk of developing cardiovascular disease, which remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States.

### Evidence from randomised controlled trials does not support current dietary fat guidelines: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^b0b27e1c]. Open Heart (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

National dietary guidelines were introduced in 1977 and 1983, by the USA and UK governments, respectively, with the ambition of reducing coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality by reducing dietary fat intake. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis by the present authors, examining the randomised controlled trial (RCT) evidence available to the dietary committees during those time periods, found no support for the recommendations to restrict dietary fat. The present investigation extends our work by re-examining the totality of RCT evidence relating to the current dietary fat guidelines.

Methods

A systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs currently available, which examined the relationship between dietary fat, serum cholesterol and the development of CHD, was undertaken.

Results

The systematic review included 62421 participants in 10 dietary trials: 7 secondary prevention studies, 1 primary prevention and 2 combined. The death rates for all-cause mortality were 6.45% and 6.06% in the intervention and control groups, respectively. The risk ratio (RR) from meta-analysis was 0.991 (95% CI 0.935 to 1.051). The death rates for CHD mortality were 2.16% and 1.80% in the intervention and control groups, respectively. The RR was 0.976 (95% CI 0.878 to 1.084). Mean serum cholesterol levels decreased in all intervention groups and all but one control group. The reductions in mean serum cholesterol levels were significantly greater in the intervention groups; this did not result in significant differences in CHD or all-cause mortality.

Conclusions

The current available evidence found no significant difference in all-cause mortality or CHD mortality, resulting from the dietary fat interventions. RCT evidence currently available does not support the current dietary fat guidelines. The evidence per se lacks generalisability for population-wide guidelines.

### Resolving the egg and cholesterol intake controversy: new clinical insights into cholesterol regulation by the liver and intestine [^f7af738a]. Endocrine Practice (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Cardiovascular disease is the number one cause of death. Achieving American Heart Association low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol treatment goals is very difficult for many patients. The importance of a low cholesterol diet is controversial and not emphasized by most physicians. Of critical importance is determining whether each individual is a "hyper- or hypo-absorber" of dietary cholesterol. Furthermore, the quantity of each individual's baseline daily dietary cholesterol and saturated fat intake is important in assessing the effect of added egg yolk cholesterol and saturated fat on blood LDL cholesterol.

Methods

Gut cholesterol is absorbed via a specific enteric receptor (the Niemann- Pick-like receptor). Dietary cholesterol contributes one fourth of the absorbed cholesterol, while the remaining gut cholesterol is derived from secreted bile cholesterol. This dietary quantity of cholesterol is significant when other determinants are constant. For some individuals, dietary cholesterol has no adverse effects and in others, a significant elevation in blood LDL cholesterol may occur.

Results

There are no readily available blood tests to determine the effect of egg yolk cholesterol and saturated fat on an individual's plasma LDL cholesterol. However, a one month trial of a low cholesterol and saturated fat diet will provide the needed information to make clinical decisions.

Conclusion

This article delineates the mechanisms that are altered by genetic and environmental factors that determine the net effects of dietary cholesterol and saturated fat on circulating LDL cholesterol. It then makes a practical clinical recommendation based on these mechanisms.

### Phytosterol capsules and serum cholesterol in hypercholesterolemia: a randomized controlled trial [^807296bd]. Atherosclerosis (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Phytosterols are recommended in combination with diet therapy to reduce elevated LDL-cholesterol level. Meta-analyses indicate a 10% reduction in LDL-cholesterol from intake of approximately 2 g phytosterols/d incorporated into fat-based foods. However, the cholesterol lowering effect from capsules containing phytosterols is less documented. The pre-specified primary endpoint of the present study was to investigate the effect of capsules with phytosterols on circulating LDL-cholesterol in patients with mild to moderate hypercholesterolemia.

Methods

In a double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover study, 41 men and women were randomized into two four-weeks intervention periods with softgel capsules containing either phytosterols (2.0 g/d) or sunflower oil. There was a three-weeks washout period between the intervention periods.

Results

No significant difference in total- or LDL-cholesterol between the phytosterol and the placebo period were observed after four weeks intervention (0.0 mmol/L (95%CI: -0.3 to 0.2), P = 0.74 and -0.1 mmol/L (95%CI: -0.3 to 0.1), P = 0.32, respectively).

Conclusion

Daily intake of capsules containing 2 g phytosterols did not reduce total- or LDL-cholesterol significantly in a highly relevant target group for the use of phytosterol products. The present results may emphasize the importance of choosing a suitable dosage-delivery system in order to achieve optimal cholesterol lowering effect. The study was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov, IDno:NCT00485095.

### Dietary intakes of eggs and cholesterol in relation to all-cause and heart disease mortality: a prospective cohort study [^e103be33]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Table 2
Associations Between Each Additional 0.5 Egg Consumed per Day and All‐Cause and Heart Disease Mortality

Overall, dietary cholesterol intake was associated with all‐cause mortality (P = 0.01 for overall association, based on the restricted cubic splines), but not with heart disease mortality (P = 0.35 for overall association; Figure). In addition, the association was U‐shaped for all‐cause mortality (P = 0.01 for nonlinearity). We separately assessed the association with all‐cause mortality in participants who consumed < 250 mg/day cholesterol and in those who consumed ≥ 250 mg/day cholesterol. The 250‐mg/day cut‐off was approximately the turning point of the U‐shaped association and the median level of previous recommended upper limit of dietary cholesterol (ranging from 200 to 300 mg). Every 50‐mg/day increase of dietary cholesterol was inversely associated with all‐cause mortality among participants with daily cholesterol intake < 250 mg (HR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.77–0.98; Table 3), but positively associated with all‐cause mortality among participants with daily cholesterol intake ≥ 250 mg (HR, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.01–1.12). No significant association was found between dietary cholesterol intake and heart disease mortality (HR, 1.00 per 50 mg/day; 95% CI, 0.93–1.08; Table 4). On a consistent basis, there was no evidence of a linear association with all‐cause and heart disease mortality when dietary cholesterol intake was assessed in quintiles (P ≥ 0.13 for linear trend for both; Table S5). For all‐cause mortality, the overall associations were generally similar in various sensitivity analyses in the 2 subgroups of participants on the basis of daily cholesterol intake levels (Table 3). In addition, the association between dietary cholesterol intake and heart disease mortality remained insignificant in all sensitivity analyses (Table 4). Our exploratory analyses also did not show a significant association between dietary cholesterol intake and stroke mortality (Table S6).

### Meta-regression analysis of the effects of dietary cholesterol intake on LDL and HDL cholesterol [^7e1f9985]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Dietary guidance recommends reducing saturated fatty acid, trans fatty acid, and cholesterol intakes to reduce circulating LDL cholesterol. Cholesterol intake may also affect high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol concentrations, but its impact has not been fully quantified.

Objectives

The aims of this study were to investigate the dose-response relation between changes in dietary cholesterol intake and changes in lipoprotein-cholesterol markers for cardiovascular disease risk and to provide a reference for clinicians on how changes in dietary cholesterol intake affect circulating cholesterol concentrations, after accounting for intakes of fatty acids.

Methods

We used a Bayesian approach to meta-regression analysis, which uses Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques, to assess the relation between the change in dietary cholesterol (adjusted for dietary fatty acids) and changes in LDL and HDL cholesterol based on the use of data from randomized dietary intervention trials.

Results

Fifty-five studies (2652 subjects) were included in the analysis. The nonlinear Michaelis-Menten (MM) and Hill models best described the data across the full spectrum of dietary cholesterol changes studied (0–1500 mg/d). Mean predicted changes in LDL cholesterol for an increase of 100 mg dietary cholesterol/d were 1.90, 4.46, and 4.58 mg/dL for the linear, nonlinear MM, and Hill models, respectively.

Conclusions

The change in dietary cholesterol was positively associated with the change in LDL-cholesterol concentration. The linear and MM models indicate that the change in dietary cholesterol is modestly inversely related to the change in circulating HDL-cholesterol concentrations in men but is positively related in women. The clinical implications of HDL-cholesterol changes associated with dietary cholesterol remain uncertain.

### Evidence from randomised controlled trials does not support current dietary fat guidelines: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^cbedd6d1]. Open Heart (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

The main findings of our systematic review and meta-analysis are that currently available RCT evidence does not support the current dietary fat guidelines. RCT evidence indicates that dietary modification may reduce serum cholesterol to a marginally greater extent in intervention groups, compared with controls. However, this reduction in serum cholesterol does not appear to translate into an improved survival from all causes or CHD.

Design limitations

As noted in the introduction, the fundamental design limitation of dietary fat interventions available to inform public health advice is that only one studyhas been undertaken involving men and women without previous heart disease. All other RCTs have been single-sex and/or secondary prevention studies.

The method of extracting dietary information was a limitation of all studies. Dietary recall is generally unreliable and 24-hour recall may not be representative of usual diet. Dietary surveys, where food is weighed at the time of being recorded, are also unreliable.

Woodhill et al noted that it is 'insuperable' to isolate dietary factors in a secondary prevention study. This is a flaw of all secondary prevention studies, not a unique flaw of this study. The study noted that changes in smoking habit, dietary pattern, body weight, lifestyle and physical activity before and after entry to the trial may have had a significant effect on prognosis (page 326).

There are some additional design limitations among the available RCTs, which may confound interpretation. A number of studiesimpaired assessment of the primary dietary intervention by adding other dietary restrictions, such as the avoidance of processed foods. This would impact industrially produced trans fat intake, which is associated with CHD. The low-fat dietresulted in the calorie intake in the intervention group ranging between 330 and 780 calories fewer than that of the control group. At the largest differential, observed after 4 years of the study, the diet group was consuming 70% of the calorie intake of the control group. This study reported mean weight loss as 7.5% in the intervention group and 4.8% in the control group. This may have favoured the intervention outcomes. The STARSmay also have favoured the intervention group by restricting participants to 1200 kcal daily until a body mass index (BMI) of 25 was achieved. Further, dietetic counselling and suitable foods were given to participants in the intervention group who did not achieve or maintain serum cholesterol reductions of 15%, making serum cholesterol levels a target, not an outcome.

### Diet for stroke prevention [^ea6cb0c7]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

The 2016 US guideline

In 2016, when the new US dietary guideline was released, there were headlines trumpeting 'It's OK to eat cholesterol again; the new guideline says so'. But it was not true. In the first paragraph, the press release said that there were insufficient data to recommend a specific limit to cholesterol intake, as in the past (300 mg/day for healthy people or 200 mg/day for those at risk of vascular disease). However, the second paragraph said: 'However, cholesterol intake should be as low as possible within the recommended eating pattern' (which resembles a Mediterranean diet). The paragraphs should have been reversed. There are still good reasons to recommend a cholesterol intake below 200 mg/day (less than one large egg yolk), and other guidelines do so.

It is little understood that 'people at risk of vascular disease' essentially means everyone who aspires to achieve a healthy old age. A 20-year-old man might think he can eat eggs and smoke with impunity, because his stroke or myocardial infarction are 45 years in the future. But why would he want to bring it on sooner?

Effects of the intestinal microbiome

Although dietary cholesterol does not increase fasting lipid levels by much, it clearly does increase coronary mortality. However, there is increasing recognition of the importance of the intestinal microbiome. While cholesterol content is essentially the same for any kind of animal flesh, red meat has more saturated fat, and has ~4 times as much carnitine as chicken or fish. Carnitine from red meatand phosphatidylcholine from egg yolkare converted by the intestinal bacteria to trimethylamine, in turn oxidised in the liver to trimethylamine n-oxide (TMAO) (figure 4). TMAO causes atherosclerosis in animal models, and in patients undergoing coronary angiograms plasma levels in the top quartile of TMAO levels after a test dose of two hard-boiled eggs predicted a 2.5-fold increase in the 3-year risk of stroke, myocardial infarction or vascular death. A 12-ounce Hardee's Monster Thickburgercontains 265 mg of cholesterol and 320 mg of carnitine. The yolk of a 65 g egg contains 237 mg of cholesterol and 250 mg of carnitine, so two egg yolks are worse than the 12-ounce burger. Patients at risk of stroke should avoid red meat and egg yolk.

Nutrition and diet — A diet emphasizing intake of vegetables, fruits, legumes, nuts, whole grains, and fish is recommended to decrease ASCVD risk factors. Replacement of saturated fat with dietary monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats can be beneficial to reduce ASCVD risk. A diet containing reduced amounts of cholesterol and sodium can be beneficial to decrease ASCVD risk. As a part of a healthy diet, it is reasonable to minimize the intake of processed meats, refined carbohydrates, and sweetened beverages to reduce ASCVD risk. As a part of a healthy diet, the intake of trans fats should be avoided to reduce ASCVD risk.

### The evolution of European guidelines: changing the management of cholesterol levels [^c6e1a4cf]. Atherosclerosis (2006). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in Europe and the US. This paper reviews the evolution of the Joint European Societies' guidelines with respect to their lipid recommendations. We stress the importance of lowering lipid levels to, or below, the currently recommended goals and argue that patients' global risk for CVD, rather than baseline lipid levels, should direct the intensity of lipid-lowering treatment. However, the emphasis on near-term (i.e., in the next 10 years) global risk estimation may under-emphasize the importance of considering lifetime cardiovascular risk in treatment decisions. Although various guidelines' thresholds for treatment initiation and recommended goals differ, they are similar in the theme of treating global risk. Most clinical trials have not identified a threshold of cholesterol level beyond which lowering cholesterol levels no longer provides cardiovascular benefit. An urgent call for action is needed to improve goal attainment in patients with or at risk for CVD. Improving access to risk-reducing treatments should be a priority.

### Saturated fats and cardiovascular health: current evidence and controversies [^adc89aea]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2021). Medium credibility.

A diet high in saturated fatty acids (SFA) is a suspected contributor to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk, in large part because of an effect to raise the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) concentration. Most dietary guidance from health authorities advocates limiting intake of SFA, particularly for people with clinical ASCVD, dyslipidemia, or diabetes mellitus. However, recent reviews have highlighted controversies regarding SFA intake and cardiovascular health. This brief editorial commentary includes a discussion of the evidence regarding SFA intake and cardiovascular health, outlines gaps in the available evidence, and proposes tentative conclusions based on what is known today about SFA consumption and ASCVD risk. Results from observational studies demonstrate that dietary patterns with lower average intakes of SFA are associated with favorable cardiovascular outcomes. Additionally, although the number of randomized controlled trials testing the effects of reducing SFA intake on ASCVD outcomes is limited, the available evidence supports the view that replacing SFA with unsaturated fatty acids, particularly polyunsaturated fatty acids, may reduce ASCVD risk. Beyond raising LDL-C and atherogenic lipoprotein particle concentrations, higher intakes of SFA may influence pathways affecting inflammation, cardiac rhythm, hemostasis, apolipoprotein CIII production, and high-density lipoprotein function. However, the impacts of these effects on ASCVD risk remain uncertain. In the authors' view, the totality of the evidence supports the current recommendation to limit SFA intake to < 10% of total daily energy for the general healthy population and further (e.g., to 5–6% of total daily energy) for patients with hypercholesterolemia.

### Dietary fats: a new look at old data challenges established wisdom [^bcae14ef]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

In the past decade, old certainties regarding dietary fats have been questioned, and some have been abandoned. Last year, US dietary guidelines removed dietary cholesterol and total fat as risk factors worth worrying about. With these new findings, the recommendation to consume less than 10% of calories per day from saturated fats will be under increased scrutiny.

How did researchers come to believe so firmly in the "diet-heart hypothesis," which holds that eating foods high in cholesterol and saturated fat leads to heart disease? In the first half of the 20th century, experiments with rabbits and international comparative studies led to the belief that diets low in fat were good for heart health. In the 1950s and 1960s it became clear that not all fats were equal. Experiments showed that saturated fat increased and polyunsaturated fat decreased plasma cholesterol concentrations. Higher concentrations were associated with a greater risk of heart disease. It followed that polyunsaturated fats were good and saturated fat was bad for the heart. Effects on serum concentrations of low density lipoprotein and high density lipoprotein cholesterol were paramount in decisions on dietary guidelines. But if blood cholesterol values are not a reliable indicator of risk of cardiovascular disease, then a careful review of the evidence that underpins dietary recommendations is warranted. Ideally, recommendations should be based on clinical outcomes, not surrogates such as cholesterol concentration.

Unfortunately, clinical outcomes do not point uniformly in the same direction in all studies. Ramsden and colleagues' analysis reports no clinical benefits of replacing saturated fat with linoleic acid. This is supported by recent observational findings that saturated fat is not associated with mortality.

In a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies, however, dietary intake of linoleic acid was inversely associated with risk of coronary heart disease in a dose-response manner. Furthermore, a Cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials found a small but potentially important reduction in cardiovascular risk associated with reduced consumption of saturated fat. That review, however, included studies that replaced saturated fat with carbohydrate, monounsaturated fat and/or protein, not specifically linoleic acid.

The randomised controlled trial design is stronger than the longitudinal observational design, but such trials on this topic were rare, relatively small, and conducted among "captive audiences" such as residents of a nursing home and mental hospitals in the MCE or outpatients at a coronary care clinic in the Sydney Diet Heart Study. Generalisability beyond these settings is arguable.

AHA/ACC dietary fats and cardiovascular risk — current evidence supports lowering saturated fat intake and substituting polyunsaturated fats. The page notes that "the totality of the evidence continues to support population-wide recommendations to lower saturated fat intake," and that "There is strong evidence that intake of polyunsaturated fat substituted for saturated fat decreases low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and reduces cardiovascular and all-cause mortality." It adds that substitution studies "clearly demonstrate the benefits of replacing SFAs with unsaturated fatty acids," and that "although dairy fat may be slightly less harmful than other food sources of saturated fat, it is far less beneficial than plant-based fats, especially polyunsaturated fatty acids." The Dietary Guidelines for Americans "focuses on healthy foods and eating patterns while acknowledging the detrimental effects of SFAs, sodium, and added sugars by recommending reduced intakes," and this report provides "guidance for reducing food sources of SFAs and replacing those calories with unsaturated fatty acids from plant-based oils."

- Optimal total blood cholesterol is 150mg/dL. What it is Blood cholesterol is a waxy, fat-like substance made by your liver. Blood cholesterol is essential for good health. Your body needs it to perform important jobs, such as making hormones and digesting fatty foods. Your body makes all the blood cholesterol it needs. Experts recommend that people eat as little dietary cholesterol as possible. Dietary cholesterol is found in animal foods, including meat, seafood, poultry, eggs, and dairy products. Learn more about preventing high cholesterol by making healthy eating choices. Low-density lipoprotein or "bad" cholesterol. Having high levels of LDL cholesterol can lead to plaque buildup in your arteries and result in heart disease or stroke. High-density lipoprotein or "good" cholesterol.

HDL is known as "good" cholesterol because high levels of it can lower your risk of heart disease and stroke. Triglycerides, a type of fat in your blood that your body uses for energy. The combination of high levels of triglycerides with either low HDL cholesterol or high LDL cholesterol levels can increase your risk for heart attack and stroke. Total cholesterol, the total amount of cholesterol in your blood based on your HDL, LDL, and triglycerides numbers. Learn more about LDL and HDL cholesterol and triglycerides. Optimal Cholesterol Levels 1 Total cholesterol About 150 mg/dL LDL cholesterol About 100 mg/dL HDL cholesterol At least 40 mg/dL in men and 50 mg/dL in women Triglycerides Less than 150 mg/dL. What problems does high cholesterol cause. Having high blood cholesterol can lead to a buildup called "plaque" on the walls of your arteries. As plaque builds up over time, the insides of your arteries narrow.

This narrowing blocks blood flow to and from your heart and other organs. When blood flow to the heart is blocked, it can cause chest pain or a heart attack. High cholesterol also increases your risk for heart disease and stroke, two leading causes of death in the United States.

### The changing roles of dietary carbohydrates: from simple to complex [^356da0d7]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2006). Low credibility.

The dietary recommendations made for carbohydrate intake by many organizations/agencies have changed over time. Early recommendations were based on the need to ensure dietary sufficiency and focused on meeting micronutrient intake requirements. Because carbohydrate-containing foods are a rich source of micronutrients, starches, grains, fruits, and vegetables became the foundation of dietary guidance, including the base of the US Department of Agriculture's Food Guide Pyramid. Dietary sufficiency recommendations were followed by recommendations to reduce cholesterol levels and the risk for cardiovascular disease; reduction in total fat (and hence saturated fat) predominated. Beginning in the 1970s, carbohydrates were recommended as the preferred substitute for fat by the American Heart Association and others to achieve the recommended successive reductions in total fat and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Additional research on fats and fatty acids found that monounsaturated fatty acids could serve as an alternative substitution for saturated fats, providing equivalent lowering of LDL-C without concomitant reductions in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and increases in triglycerides witnessed when carbohydrates replace saturated fat. This research led to a sharper focus in the guidelines in the 1990s toward restricting saturated fat and liberalizing a range of intake of total fat. Higher-fat diets, still low in saturated fatty acids, became alternative strategies to lower-fat diets. As the population has become increasingly overweight and obese, the emergence of the metabolic syndrome and its associated disruptions in glucose and lipid metabolism has led to reconsiderations of the role of carbohydrate-containing foods in the American diet. Consequently, a review of the evidence for and against high-carbohydrate diets is important to put this controversy into perspective. The current dietary recommendations for carbohydrate intake are supported by the evidence.

### Evidence from randomised controlled trials did not support the introduction of dietary fat guidelines in 1977 and 1983: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^9d3467ad]. Open Heart (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

National dietary guidelines were introduced in 1977 and 1983, by the US and UK governments, respectively, with the ambition of reducing coronary heart disease (CHD) by reducing fat intake. To date, no analysis of the evidence base for these recommendations has been undertaken. The present study examines the evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) available to the US and UK regulatory committees at their respective points of implementation.

Methods

A systematic review and meta-analysis were undertaken of RCTs, published prior to 1983, which examined the relationship between dietary fat, serum cholesterol and the development of CHD.

Results

2467 males participated in six dietary trials: five secondary prevention studies and one including healthy participants. There were 370 deaths from all-cause mortality in the intervention and control groups. The risk ratio (RR) from meta-analysis was 0.996 (95% CI 0.865 to 1.147). There were 207 and 216 deaths from CHD in the intervention and control groups, respectively. The RR was 0.989 (95% CI 0.784 to 1.247). There were no differences in all-cause mortality and non-significant differences in CHD mortality, resulting from the dietary interventions. The reductions in mean serum cholesterol levels were significantly higher in the intervention groups; this did not result in significant differences in CHD or all-cause mortality. Government dietary fat recommendations were untested in any trial prior to being introduced.

Conclusions

Dietary recommendations were introduced for 220 million US and 56 million UK citizens by 1983, in the absence of supporting evidence from RCTs.

Dietary fat intake — pediatric thresholds and essential fatty acid ranges are specified as follows: The National Cholesterol Education Program recommended "less than 30 percent of total calories from fat, less than 10 percent from saturated fat, and cholesterol intake < 300 mg/d for all healthy U.S. children 2 years and older." There is "no biologic requirement for" saturated fatty acids (SFA), and Dietary Reference Intake guidance "promote[s] the intake of essential fatty acids from unsaturated sources, specifically ALA and LA omega-6 fatty acids," with acceptable ranges "LA is 5–10 percent of fat calories" and "ALA is 0.6–1.2 percent of fat calories for children and adults."

### Evidence from prospective cohort studies does not support current dietary fat guidelines: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1f768d4c]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

National dietary guidelines were introduced in 1977 and 1983, by the US and UK governments to reduce coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality by reducing dietary fat intake. Our 2016 systematic review examined the epidemiological evidence available to the dietary committees at the time; we found no support for the recommendations to restrict dietary fat. The present investigation extends our work by re-examining the totality of epidemiological evidence currently available relating to dietary fat guidelines.

Methods

A systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies currently available, which examined the relationship between dietary fat, serum cholesterol and the development of CHD, were undertaken.

Results

Across 7 studies, involving 89801 participants (94% male), there were 2024 deaths from CHD during the mean follow-up of 11.9 ± 5.6years. The death rate from CHD was 2.25%. Eight data sets were suitable for inclusion in meta-analysis; all excluded participants with previous heart disease. Risk ratios (RRs) from meta-analysis were not statistically significant for CHD deaths and total or saturated fat consumption. The RR from meta-analysis for total fat intake and CHD deaths was 1.04 (95% CI 0.98 to 1.10). The RR from meta-analysis for saturated fat intake and CHD deaths was 1.08 (95% CI 0.94 to 1.25).

Conclusions

Epidemiological evidence to date found no significant difference in CHD mortality and total fat or saturated fat intake and thus does not support the present dietary fat guidelines. The evidence per se lacks generalisability for population-wide guidelines.

### Public health guidelines should recommend reducing saturated fat consumption as much as possible: NO [^56ad1ef3]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2020). Medium credibility.

The proposition that dietary SFAs should be restricted to the maximal extent possible (e.g., to achieve approximately half of current consumption) is based primarily on observational and clinical trial data that are interpreted as indicating a benefit of such limitation on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Further support is believed to derive from the capacity of SFAs to raise LDL cholesterol, and the evidence that LDL-cholesterol lowering reduces CVD incidence. Despite their apparent merit, these arguments are flawed. In fact, although it is possible that dietary intake of SFAs has a causal role in CVD, the evidence to support this contention is inconclusive. Moreover, other considerations argue against a guideline focused primarily on limiting SFA intake, including the heterogeneity of individual SFAs, the likelihood of clinically meaningful interindividual variation in response to SFA reduction, the potential for unintended health consequences of population-wide promotion of severe restriction, and the critical differences in health impacts among individual SFA-containing foods.

### Expert panel on integrated guidelines for cardiovascular health and risk reduction in children and adolescents: summary report [^fe64cb30]. PES (2012). Medium credibility.

Summary of the evidence review for dietary fat intake — safe intake targets and observed effects indicate that a diet with total fat at less than 30 percent of calories, saturated fat less than 10 percent of calories, and cholesterol intake < 300 mg/d is safe for healthy children; modifying the type and amount of fat intake in children's diets can be effectively accomplished by qualified ongoing nutritional guidance and behavioral counseling for parents and children, preferably along with environmental change. Dietary intervention studies using trained nutritionists safely achieved an average total fat intake of 28–30 percent of calories and an average saturated fat intake of 8–10 percent of calories, and these levels were shown in RCTs to be associated with lower TC and LDL–C levels in intervention subjects compared with control subjects. No harmful, adverse effects of restricting total or saturated fat intake at these levels were demonstrated through several years of follow-up, with one RCT demonstrating no harm for as long as 14 years.

### Cardiovascular harm from egg yolk and meat: more than just cholesterol and saturated fat [^db9f883c]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Effect of Diet on Fasting Levels of Risk Factors Versus Actual Effects on Cardiovascular Risk

Cardiovascular risk factors such as LDL‐C are indirect and imperfect predictors of risk. Most cardiovascular events occur in people at average risk factor levels who are misclassified by traditional risk factor scoring as low or intermediate risk. The effect of diet on the fasting level of risk factors is probably not what matters most for actual cardiovascular risk. We suggest that the consumption of meat and egg yolk increases cardiovascular risk and that this is probably mainly attributed to their postprandial effects. For ≈4 hours after a high‐fat/high‐cholesterol meal, there is a marked increase in the oxidation of LDL‐C, endothelial dysfunction, and arterial inflammation. There have been many studies over the years indicating that dietary cholesterol causes atherosclerosis in animal models and is associated with increased human coronary artery disease.

When the US dietary guideline for 2015 to 2020 appeared, there were jubilant headlines saying essentially that "it's OK to eat cholesterol now; the new guideline says so!" However, that is not what the guideline said. Previous guidelines said (for good reason 8) that people at risk of cardiovascular disease should limit cholesterol intake to < 200 mg a day — < 1 large (63 g) egg yolk. The press release from that guideline said in the first paragraph that there were insufficient data to identify a numeric limit to cholesterol intake such as 200 to 300 mg/day, so this would no longer be specified. However, the second paragraph said that cholesterol intake should be as low as possible within the recommended eating pattern (page 32 of the full guideline). The 2 paragraphs should have been reversed to avoid the confusion that resulted from that press release. Similar to the recent Canadian guideline, the US guideline recommended a more plant‐based diet.

### Efficacy of aerobic exercise and a prudent diet for improving selected lipids and lipoproteins in adults: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^c14df6c7]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Studies addressing the effects of aerobic exercise and a prudent diet on lipid and lipoprotein concentrations in adults have reached conflicting conclusions. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of aerobic exercise combined with a prudent diet on lipid and lipoprotein concentrations in adults.

Methods

Studies were located by searching nine electronic databases, cross-referencing, and expert review. Two independent reviewers selected studies that met the following criteria: (1) randomized controlled trials, (2) aerobic exercise combined with diet recommendations (saturated/trans fat intake less than 10% of total calories and cholesterol less than 300 mg/day and/or fiber intake ≥ 25 g/day in women and ≥ 35 grams per day in men), (3) intervention ≥ 4 weeks, (4) humans ≥ 18 years of age, (5) published studies, including dissertations and Master's theses, (6) studies published in any language, (7) studies published between January 1, 1955 and May 1, 2009, (8) assessment of one or more of the following lipid and lipoprotein concentrations: total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), ratio of TC to HDL-C, non-HDL-C, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and triglycerides (TG). Two reviewers independently extracted all data. Random-effects models that account for heterogeneity and 95% confidence intervals were used to pool findings.

Results

Of the 1,401 citations reviewed, six studies representing 16 groups (8 intervention, 8 control) and up to 559 men and women (282 intervention, 277 control) met the criteria for analysis. Statistically significant intervention minus control reductions were found for TC (-15.5 mg/dl, 95% CI, -20.3 to -10.7), TC:HDL-C (-0.4 mg/dl, 95% CI, -0.7 to -0.2), LDL-C (-9.2 mg/dl, 95% CI, -12.7 to -5.8) and TG (-10.6 mg/dl, 95% CI, -17.2 to -4.0) but not HDL-C (-0.5 mg/dl, 95% CI, -4.0 to 3.1). Changes were equivalent to reductions of 7.5%, 6.6%, 7.2% and 18.2% respectively, for TC, TC:HDL-C, LDL-C and TG. Because of missing variance statistics, non-HDL-C was excluded.

Conclusions

Aerobic exercise combined with a prudent diet is highly efficacious for improving TC, TC:HDL-C, LDL-C and TG, but not HDL-C concentrations, in adults. However, additional studies are needed, including effectiveness studies using intention-to-treat analysis.

### Egg consumption and risk of cardiovascular disease: three large prospective US cohort studies, systematic review, and updated meta-analysis [^1782a29e]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

In the United States, cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in men and women. Diet and lifestyle undisputedly play a major part in the development of cardiovascular disease. In the past, limiting dietary cholesterol intake to 300 mg per day was widely recommended to prevent cardiovascular disease. However, because of the weak association between dietary cholesterol and blood cholesterol, and considering that dietary cholesterol is no longer a nutrient of concern for overconsumption, the most recent 2015 dietary guidelines for Americans did not carry forward this recommendation.

Eggs are a major source of dietary cholesterol, but they are also an affordable source of high quality protein, iron, unsaturated fatty acids, phospholipids, and carotenoids. However, because of the cholesterol content in eggs, the association between egg intake and cardiovascular disease risk has been a topic of intense debate in the past decade. Many prospective studies on the association between egg intake and cardiovascular disease risk have provided conflicting findings. Some studies have reported no association between egg intake and risk of cardiovascular disease, some have reported a higher risk, and others have reported an inverse association with cardiovascular disease eventsor subclinical measures. Even meta-analyses of prospective studies on egg consumption and cardiovascular disease risk did not provide consistent results and created further confusion.

### Expert panel on integrated guidelines for cardiovascular health and risk reduction in children and adolescents: summary report [^4cf87c74]. PES (2012). Medium credibility.

Pediatric cardiovascular guidelines — dietary pattern emphasizes a variety of vegetables, fruit, whole grains, and low-fat dairy products; includes protein foods such as lean meats, poultry without skin, seafood, beans and peas, eggs, processed soy products, nuts, and seeds; is low in saturated fat and trans fat, cholesterol, sodium, and added sugar; and stays within daily calorie limits. The underlying premise of the 2010 DGA is that foods, not supplements, should constitute the primary basis of a recommended eating plan for children and adolescents, and because the focus of these Guidelines is on CV risk reduction, the evidence review specifically evaluated dietary fatty acid and energy components as major contributors to hypercholesterolemia and obesity, as well as dietary composition and micronutrients as they affect hypertension. On average, children need greater energy intake per kilogram of body weight than adults to accommodate the body's demands for growth, and this must be balanced with physical activity needs.

Diet and Weight Management

The 2013 AHA/ACC Guideline on Lifestyle Management to Reduce Cardiovascular Riskreaffirms diet as an important intervention for lowering cholesterol and BP. The guideline recommended that patients eat plenty of vegetables, fruits, and whole grains; incorporate low‐fat dairy products, poultry, fish, legumes, nontropical vegetable oils, and nuts into their diet; and limit intake of sweets, sugar‐sweetened beverages, and red meats. Patients that specifically need to lower their cholesterol levels should reduce saturated and trans fat consumption, with ideally only 5% to 6% of daily calorie intake coming from saturated fat. Those with high BP should consume no more than 2400 mg of sodium a day, with an even greater effect in those consuming < 1500 mg a day.

Although many strategies exist to help patients maintain a heart healthy diet, the DASH diet, the US Department of Agriculture's "Choose My Plate," and the AHA diet are recommended and can be adapted for appropriate calorie requirements, personal and cultural food preferences, and nutritional treatment of other medical conditions. The Mediterranean‐style diet (enriched with olive oil, legumes, fish, chicken, nuts, wine, fruits and vegetables and low in artificial sugars, commercial sweets, pastries, butter, margarine, and red meat) also yields heart‐healthy benefits. In fact, the Mediterranean diet was recently shown in the Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea (PREDIMED) randomized trial to reduce the incidence of CV events (especially stroke) in high‐risk patientsand to improve glycemic control in those with type 2 diabetes.

Obesity (body mass index [BMI] ≥ 30 kg/m 2) is a major risk factor for CHD and carries even greater risk when fat is concentrated within the abdominal viscera. The 2013 AHA/ACC/The Obesity Society Guideline for the Management of Overweight and Obesity in Adultsrecommends that height, weight, BMI, and waist circumference be measured annually or more frequently in those that are overweight or obese. Current cut points for overweight and obesity are BMI > 25.0 to 29.9 kg/m 2 and BMI ≥ 30 kg/m 2, respectively. Although increased waist circumference is defined as > 35 in or 88 cm for women and > 40 in or 102 cm for men, even lower cutoffs should be used in some ethnic populations (eg, Hispanic, Asian, and African descent).

### Cardiovascular risk factor reduction in first responders resulting from an individualized lifestyle and blood test program: a randomized controlled trial [^a8dc691a]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

Baseline Characteristics of the Treatment and Control Conditions

The 96 treatment and 79 control subjects who began the study were well matched for age, sex, measures of adiposity, α 1 HDL (the primary outcome variable), and most other variables (Table 1). Thirty-six percent of the baseline sample (32.2% of treatment, 40% controls) had clinically low HDL-cholesterol (< 40 mg/dL). However, there was a 4-fold range in α 1 HDL in subjects with clinically low HDL-cholesterol, and a 5.6-fold range in α 1 HDL for subjects with normal to high HDL-cholesterol. Cholesterol medication use at baseline was nearly twice as high in the treatment as in the control group (27.1% vs 15.2%), but its use remained relatively stable during the study, 28.2% versus 14.3% at 3 months, 32.0% versus 11.4% at 6 months, and 29.7% versus 14.5% at 12 months. Statins represented all of the cholesterol medication use in the control group, and 92.3% in treatment group.

TABLE 1
Baseline Characteristics of the Recruited Sample

As percent of total energy intake, the median prescribed intake in the intervention group was 29% for protein (minimum, 25 th percentile, 75 th percentile, maximum: 15%, 24.5%, 32%, 35%, respectively), 41% for carbohydrates (30%, 38%, 45.5%, 55%, respectively), 30% for total fat (30%, 30%, 30%, 35%, respectively), and 10% for saturated fat (7%, 10%, 10%, 10%, respectively). Daily dietary cholesterol intake was recommended to stay below 200 mg/d for 45.2% of the sample and below 300 mg/d for 54.8% of the sample.

### Dietary recommendations in the prevention and treatment of coronary heart disease: do we have the ideal diet yet? [^ec92a5e6]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

To respond to the question of the best "heart-healthy" diet, we reviewed the effects of common diets on lipids, their efficacy, advantages, and limitations. The high-protein, low-carbohydrate diet is effective for weight loss over the short term, but its long-term benefits remain unproved. The very low-fat diet decreases levels of total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and, with lifestyle modifications, may slow progression of coronary atherosclerosis. The high-protein and very low-fat diets are difficult to follow over the long term. The American Heart Association diet, which is rich in fruits, vegetables, and nuts, decreases blood pressure and may be acceptable to most patients. However, it is rich in carbohydrates and may not be suitable for patients who are obese and/or have high levels of triglycerides. In such patients, diet based on foods with a low glycemic index may be an alternative. There is also immense interest in the Mediterranean diet, which is acceptable to most patients, may decrease some biomarkers of coronary atherosclerosis, and may decrease cardiovascular events and death. Despite these options, there is no "fits all" dietary recommendation for prevention of coronary heart disease. Importantly, dietary discretion is only 1 part of lifestyle changes, such as exercise and smoking cessation.

### Yet another study stirring the debate on saturated fat [^25a10cfc]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2022). Medium credibility.

See corresponding article on.

Dietary recommendations that guide the population toward healthy food choices have come a long way over the last 100 y. The prominence of a nutrient-based focus in earlier guidelines has yielded to recommendations promoting whole dietary patterns compatible with long-term health. Consistent features among current dietary guidelines around the world include emphasis on vegetables, fruits, and whole-grain products. The promotion of plant-based food products has also recently made its way into many food guides for both chronic disease prevention as well as diet sustainability purposes. The science supporting the place of these foods in a variety of healthy dietary patterns is hardly disputable. The recommendation to limit the consumption of highly processed foods to reduce the intake of sodium, added sugar, and SFAs is also a ubiquitous feature of most healthy eating guidelines.

Although mostly food-based, several dietary guidelines, including the Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA) 2020–2025 and Canada's Food Guide (CFG) 2019, continue to make specific recommendations targeting nutrients of public health concern, including SFAs. The SFA limit set by both the DGA 2020–2025 and the 2019 CFG is < 10% of total daily energy. The consumption of reduced-fat dairy foods is also encouraged to lower one's intake of SFAs. Discouraging the consumption of dietary SFA has been one of the key dietary targets of cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention for > 60 y. Increased intakes of SFAs almost invariably elevate serum LDL-cholesterol concentrations, which on its own is convincing enough to identify SFA as a villain. Replacing dietary SFAs by unsaturated fat has also been associated with cardiovascular benefits in several meta-analyses. Yet, the consensus around SFAs has eroded in the last 10 y. Why is that? For one, several meta-analyses have reported that dietary SFAs are not associated with an increased risk of CVD. Unsurprisingly, these controversy-stirring meta-analyses have been heavily criticized. On the other hand, there is emerging evidence from clinical and epidemiologic studies that SFAs from different sources may differentially affect cardiometabolic and CVD risk. For example, high intakes of SFAs from cheese did not increase LDL cholesterol to the same extent as the same high intakes of SFAs from butter. With more and more published studies on this topic, the concept that the food matrix may influence the cardiometabolic impacts of nutrients such as SFAs is both intriguing and challenging.

### Nutrition interventions for youth with dyslipidemia: a National Lipid Association clinical perspective [^99f35784]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2022). High credibility.

Table 10 — Dietary recommendations for treatment of children and adolescents with hypertriglyceridemia present, for moderate hypertriglyceridemia, fat at 25–30% daily caloric intake and to increase dietary sources of omega-3 fatty acids (O3FAs), with fish high in eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) while low in methyl-mercury recommended; cholesterol is 200 mg or less per day; and carbohydrate guidance is to decrease sugar intake by limiting foods and beverages with added sugars. Additional recommendations state that supplementation with prescription O3FAs may be beneficial for further TG-lowering, encourage 60 min moderate-to-vigorous physical activity or active play time daily for children 2 years of age and older, and limit sedentary screen time to < 2 h daily. For severe hypertriglyceridemia (familial chylomicronemia syndrome and multifactorial chylomicronemia syndrome), fat is < 10–15% daily caloric intake (< 15–20 g/day), ensure adequate intake of essential fatty acids (EFA), and medium chain triglyceride (MCT) oil, as needed, to increase caloric intake and daily percent caloric intake from fat; carbohydrates are limited to < 60% daily caloric intake with advice to avoid foods that contain simple carbohydrates and avoid alcohol; and additional recommendations include to monitor for EFA deficiency and fat-soluble vitamin deficiency — supplement as needed, encourage 60 min moderate-to-vigorous physical activity or active play time daily for children 2 years of age and older, and limit sedentary screen time to < 2 h daily; note that recent guidelines recommend lowering dietary cholesterol, but do not provide a specific limit.

### Dietary intakes of eggs and cholesterol in relation to all-cause and heart disease mortality: a prospective cohort study [^baea4424]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In this study we did not find a significant association between dietary intake of eggs and all‐cause and heart disease mortality in US adults, whereas total dietary cholesterol intake at high levels seemed to be associated with higher risk of all‐cause mortality. Our findings are generally supportive of the recommendation from the 2015–2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans that moderate consumption of up to 1 egg per day may be included in a healthy dietary pattern. However, caution should be taken for high‐risk individuals, such as those with hypercholesterolemia and those already with high dietary cholesterol intake levels. Our analyses should be replicated in other populations with different intake levels of eggs and cholesterol. In addition, further prospective studies are warranted to investigate the relationships between of high dietary egg and cholesterol intake and other major health outcomes such as incident CVDs and their subtypes.

Dietary adjuncts for lowering atherogenic cholesterol — plant sterols/stanols and viscous fibers: If a diet based on a cardioprotective dietary pattern plus activity and weight loss is insufficient to attain goals, clinicians may consider the use of dietary adjuncts; the NLA Expert Panel consensus view is that there was sufficient evidence to recommend consideration of supplemental plant sterols/stanols (∼2 g/day) and viscous fibers (5–10 g/day) to enhance reductions in atherogenic cholesterol, noting that greater viscous fiber intake (10 to 25 g/day) will generally result in greater lowering but is challenging to achieve, and that ASCVD event trials are not available for these interventions.

### Dietary cholesterol and egg intake are associated with the risk of gestational diabetes: a prospective study from southwest China [^85c827ea]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

The mechanisms underlying the effect of dietary cholesterol on blood glucose metabolism have not been fully determined. Many studies have documented that plasma lipids play an important role in blood glucose homeostasis. Some animal experiments have found that elevated plasma cholesterol levels may activate the proinflammatory signal cascade, and excessive cholesterol intake may elevate the serum levels of the amyloid A inflammatory marker, suggesting that excessive cholesterol intake increases serum cholesterol concentration, promotes the inflammatory response, and leads to insulin resistance. Another study has suggested that cholesterol accumulation in islets may cause damage to the function of pancreatic β-cells. In the present study, after adjustment for plasma lipid levels, the association was still present, suggesting that the effect of dietary cholesterol on blood glucose is not entirely due to hyperlipidaemia. Path analysis showed that cholesterol intake not only increased the risk of GDM by elevating plasma TC, but also increased the risk of GDM through other pathways.

The 2015–2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans does not specify a daily cholesterol intake limit but recommends consuming as little dietary cholesterol as possible while consuming a healthy eating pattern. In 2013, the Chinese Nutrition Society removed the upper limit of recommended dietary cholesterol intake from the DRIs. These recommendations might lead to excessive dietary cholesterol and egg consumption in the general population, leading to an increase in the incidence of GDM or T2DM. The dietary cholesterol intake of Chinese adults has gradually increased over the past 20 years from 165.8 mg/d in 1991 to 266.3 mg/d in 2011. In the present study, the average dietary cholesterol intake in early pregnancy, mainly from egg consumption, was 340.8 mg/d. Current evidence suggests that overconsumption of cholesterol can have deleterious effects in pregnant women. Thus, cholesterol intake should be limited to reasonable levels in pregnant women to reduce the risks of GDM.

### Expert panel on integrated guidelines for cardiovascular health and risk reduction in children and adolescents: summary report [^6cdb1f9b]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Pediatric cardiovascular health dietary pattern — children and adolescents. The guideline emphasizes a variety of vegetables, fruit, whole grains, and low-fat dairy products; includes protein foods such as lean meats, poultry without skin, seafood, beans and peas, eggs, processed soy products, nuts, and seeds; is low in saturated fat and trans fat, cholesterol, sodium, and added sugar; and stays within daily calorie limits. The underlying premise of the 2010 DGA is that foods, not supplements, should constitute the primary basis of a recommended eating plan for children and adolescents, and the evidence review specifically evaluated dietary fatty acid and energy components as major contributors to hypercholesterolemia and obesity, as well as dietary composition and micronutrients as they affect hypertension. On average, children need greater energy intake per kilogram of body weight than adults to accommodate the body's demands for growth, and this must be balanced with physical activity needs.

### Dietary fats and cardiovascular disease: a presidential advisory from the American Heart Association [^9d30e08e]. Circulation (2017). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading global cause of death, accounting for 17.3 million deaths per year. Preventive treatment that reduces CVD by even a small percentage can substantially reduce, nationally and globally, the number of people who develop CVD and the costs of caring for them. This American Heart Association presidential advisory on dietary fats and CVD reviews and discusses the scientific evidence, including the most recent studies, on the effects of dietary saturated fat intake and its replacement by other types of fats and carbohydrates on CVD. In summary, randomized controlled trials that lowered intake of dietary saturated fat and replaced it with polyunsaturated vegetable oil reduced CVD by ≈30%, similar to the reduction achieved by statin treatment. Prospective observational studies in many populations showed that lower intake of saturated fat coupled with higher intake of polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fat is associated with lower rates of CVD and of other major causes of death and all-cause mortality. In contrast, replacement of saturated fat with mostly refined carbohydrates and sugars is not associated with lower rates of CVD and did not reduce CVD in clinical trials. Replacement of saturated with unsaturated fats lowers low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, a cause of atherosclerosis, linking biological evidence with incidence of CVD in populations and in clinical trials. Taking into consideration the totality of the scientific evidence, satisfying rigorous criteria for causality, we conclude strongly that lowering intake of saturated fat and replacing it with unsaturated fats, especially polyunsaturated fats, will lower the incidence of CVD. This recommended shift from saturated to unsaturated fats should occur simultaneously in an overall healthful dietary pattern such as DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) or the Mediterranean diet as emphasized by the 2013 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology lifestyle guidelines and the 2015 to 2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans.

### Dietary cholesterol and myocardial infarction in the million veteran program [^c6213722]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Adherence to the DASH diet with reduced intake of dietary cholesterol improved outcomes compared with DASH diet adherence with a high intake of dietary cholesterol. A recent prospective analysis of 27 078 men in the ATBC (Alpha‐Tocopherol, Beta‐Carotene Cancer Prevention) study investigated the relationship between dietary cholesterol, serum cholesterol, and egg consumption with cause‐specific mortality. This study showed greater dietary cholesterol and egg consumption were associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease‐related mortality. Another study of 30 000 participants from the United States followed for 31 years included a more diverse population including 31% Black and 55% female subjects. Their findings showed that with each additional 300 mg of dietary cholesterol daily, there was a 17% increased risk for cardiovascular disease. They also found that the dietary cholesterol mortality risk estimates were higher in women. These studies with more diverse subject populations correlate with the results found in this study, where we observed that higher dietary cholesterol intake was significantly associated with a higher risk of MI in a large cohort of US veterans. Although recommendations on dietary cholesterol intake for improving cardiovascular outcomes have been highly debated, there has been expanding evidence correlating with the findings of this study. Further large interventional studies need to be conducted to further uncover this association.

Maintaining healthy dietary patterns, such as the DASH and Mediterranean diets, which are both low in dietary cholesterol, should remain as one of the primary focuses to optimize cardiovascular health, because this lifestyle habit may be easier for individuals to independently implement. Additionally, reductions in cholesterol intake, which can be achieved by lowering the intake of meat and eggs, may reduce the risk of incident MI. Encouraging such dietary recommendations to target reduced cholesterol intake may potentially improve cardiovascular fitness for veterans.

### Lipoprotein (a) and diet-a challenge for a role of saturated fat in cardiovascular disease risk reduction? [^9433b8ab]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2023). Medium credibility.

In this perspective, we discuss new evidence relating to current dietary recommendations to reduce SFA intake to modulate an individual's global risk of CVD. Although it is well established that lowering dietary SFA intake has a beneficial effect on LDL cholesterol concentrations, findings increasingly indicate an opposite effect on lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] concentrations. In recent years, many studies have firmly established a role for an elevated Lp(a) concentration as a genetically regulated, causal, and prevalent risk factor for CVD. However, there is less awareness of the effect of dietary SFA intake on Lp(a) concentrations. This study discusses this issue and highlights the contrasting effect of reducing dietary SFA intake on LDL cholesterol and Lp(a), 2 highly atherogenic lipoproteins. This calls attention to the need for precision nutrition approaches that move beyond a "one-size-fits-all" approach. To illustrate the contrast, we describe the dynamic contributions of Lp(a) and LDL cholesterol concentrations to CVD risk during interventions with a low-SFA diet, with the hope that this will stimulate further studies and discussions regarding dietary management of CVD risk.

Dietary fat limits in children — within appropriate age- and gender-based requirements, intake of total fat can be safely limited to 25–30 percent of total calories, saturated fat intake limited to 7–10 percent of calories, and dietary cholesterol limited to 300 mg/d; fat intake in infants younger than 12 months of age should not be restricted without medical indication. The remaining 20 percent of fat intake should comprise a combination of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats, and intake of trans fat should be limited as much as possible.

### Associations of dietary cholesterol, serum cholesterol, and egg consumption with overall and cause-specific mortality: systematic review and updated meta-analysis [^f6129304]. Circulation (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Despite substantial research highlighting the importance of exogenous dietary cholesterol intake and endogenous serum cholesterol level in human health, a thorough evaluation of the associations is lacking. Our study objective was to examine overall and cause-specific mortality in relation to dietary and serum cholesterol, as well as egg consumption, and conduct an updated meta-regression analysis of cohort studies.

Methods

We conducted a prospective analysis of 27 078 men in the ATBC Study (Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention). Multivariable-controlled cause-specific Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to calculate hazard ratios and 31-year absolute mortality risk differences. A systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort studies was also performed (PROSPERO [URL: https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/; Unique identifier: CRD42021272756]).

Results

Based on 482 316 person-years of follow-up, we identified 22 035 deaths, including 9110 deaths from cardiovascular disease (CVD). Greater dietary cholesterol and egg consumption were associated with increased risk of overall and CVD-related mortality. Hazard ratios for each additional 300 mg cholesterol intake per day were 1.10 and 1.13 for overall and CVD-related mortality, respectively; for each additional 50-g egg consumed daily, hazard ratios were 1.06 and 1.09, respectively, for overall and CVD-related mortality (all P values < 0.0001). After multivariable adjustment, higher serum total cholesterol concentrations were associated with increased risk of CVD-related mortality (hazard ratios per 1 SD increment, 1.14; P < 0.0001). The observed associations were generally similar across cohort subgroups. The updated meta-analysis of cohort studies on the basis of 49 risk estimates, 3601401 participants, and 255479 events showed consumption of 1 additional 50-g egg daily was associated with significantly increased CVD risk (pooled relative risk, 1.04 [95% CI, 1.00–1.08]; I² = 80.1%). In the subgroup analysis of geographic regions (P interaction = 0.02), an increase of 50-g egg consumed daily was associated with a higher risk of CVD in US cohorts (pooled relative risk, 1.08 [95% CI, 1.02–1.14]) and appeared related to a higher CVD risk in European cohorts with borderline significance (pooled relative risk, 1.05), but was not associated with CVD risk in Asian cohorts.

Conclusions

In this prospective cohort study and updated meta-analysis, greater dietary cholesterol and egg consumption were associated with increased risk of overall and CVD-related mortality. Our findings support restricted consumption of dietary cholesterol as a means to improve long-term health and longevity.

### Expert panel on integrated guidelines for cardiovascular health and risk reduction in children and adolescents: summary report [^fe8b4481]. PES (2012). Medium credibility.

Nutrition and diet — ages 11–21 y — primary beverage: fat-free unflavored milk; limit/avoid sugar-sweetened beverages; encourage water. Fat content guidance includes total fat 25–30% of daily kcal/EER, saturated fat 8–10% of daily kcal/EER, avoid trans fat as much as possible, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fat up to 20% of daily kcal/EER, and cholesterol < 300 mg/d. Encourage high dietary fiber intake from foods with a goal of 14 g/1,000 kcal; limit naturally sweetened juice (no added sugar) to 4–6 oz/d and encourage healthy eating habits such as breakfast every day, eating meals as a family, and limiting fast food meals. Naturally fiber-rich foods are recommended (fruits, vegetables, whole grains); fiber supplements are not advised, and refined carbohydrates should be limited (sugars, white rice, white bread).

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 2 [^8b64a8f2]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Plant sterols/stanols (PS) efficacy and triglyceride effects — use characteristics: Across formats and at intake levels ≤ 2 g/day, responses to plant sterols versus stanols and fat-based versus non-fat-based or dairy versus nondairy foods did not differ, and consuming PS multiple times per day may yield greater efficacy than a single intake, with single doses most effective when taken during or shortly after a meal that triggers bile flow. Absolute low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) reductions are larger with higher baseline LDL-C, though percentage reductions are similar across a wide baseline range. Beyond LDL-C, PS reduce triglyceride (TG) concentrations: in a meta-analysis of 12 randomized controlled trials, PS 1.6 to 2.5 g/day produced about a 6% TG reduction; subsequent reports show variable TG lowering from 0.8 to 28%, with greater responses in elevated TG (≥ 150 mg/dL) of 11–28% versus 0.8–7% in those with normal TG levels.

### Nutrition interventions for adults with dyslipidemia: a clinical perspective from the National Lipid Association [^969876d4]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2023). Medium credibility.

Lifestyle habits can have a profound impact on atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk. The National Lipid Association previously published recommendations for lifestyle therapies to manage dyslipidemia. This Clinical Perspective provides an update with a focus on nutrition interventions for the three most common dyslipidemias in adults: 1) low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) elevation; 2) triglyceride (TG) elevation, including severe hypertriglyceridemia with chylomicronemia; and 3) combined dyslipidemia, with elevations in both LDL-C and TG levels. Lowering LDL-C and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol are the primary objectives for reducing ASCVD risk. With severe TG elevation (≥ 500 mg/dL), the primary objective is to prevent pancreatitis and ASCVD risk reduction is secondary. Nutrition interventions that lower LDL-C levels include reducing cholesterol-raising fatty acids and dietary cholesterol, as well as increasing intakes of unsaturated fatty acids, plant proteins, viscous fibers, and reducing adiposity for patients with overweight or obesity. Selected dietary supplements may be employed as dietary adjuncts. Nutrition interventions for all patients with elevated TG levels include restricting intakes of alcohol, added sugars, and refined starches. Additional lifestyle factors that reduce TG levels are participating in daily physical activity and reducing adiposity in patients with overweight or obesity. For patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia, an individualized approach is essential. Nutrition interventions for addressing concurrent elevations in LDL-C and TG include a combination of the strategies described for lowering LDL-C and TG. A multidisciplinary approach is recommended to facilitate success in making and sustaining dietary changes and the assistance of a registered dietitian nutritionist is highly recommended.

### Gender differences and typical nutrition concerns of the diets of preschool children-the results of the first stage of an intervention study [^a68cad3d]. BMC Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Assessment of macronutrient intake

The favourable feature of the studied preschoolers' macronutrient intake was adequate intake of monounsaturated fatty acids and cholesterol. Intake of these macronutrients was also adequate in other Polish preschoolers, as well as in preschool children from other countries. Adequate intake of monounsaturated fatty acids in Polish children results from the popularity of rapeseed oil which in Poland is produced in large amounts. In Belgium, Finland and Great Britain rapeseed oil production is quite high and the highest of all other oils, whereas Spain and Greece are known for the widespread use of olive oil. It is also not surprising that cholesterol intake falls under the upper limit recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) in the prevention of diet-related diseases since energy intake at this stage of life is relatively low in comparison to energy intake of adults and the limit is the same irrespective of age. However, those children whose cholesterol intake was close to this limit are at risk of excessive cholesterol intake in the future because the increase of energy intake, which must accompany the increase of body height and body mass, may result in the increased intake of cholesterol. This may be observed in Spanish children: 2–5-year-olds consumed slightly less cholesterol than the upper limit, while 6–9-year-olds exceeded the WHO recommendations. Of course, one may claim that the amount of cholesterol in the diet is not important because recent recommendations of the European Food Safety Authority and the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee of the United States Department of Agriculture have not included any limitations of cholesterol intake. However, in our opinion this claim is not adequate for two reasons. First of all, the fact of not including the limits on cholesterol intake in the dietary guidelines worked out by both European and American experts, does not mean that cholesterol may be consumed in large amounts, as was interpreted by mass media. The experts did not state that high cholesterol intake is good for cardiovascular health. They only stated that the evidence is not adequate enough for setting a quantitative limit. Besides high-cholesterol foods are usually rich source of saturated fatty acids and these fatty acids should be limited in the daily diet. Moreover, examples of healthy eating patterns in the American guidelines in fact limit dietary cholesterol to a range of 100 to 300 mg/day. The second reason is the high prevalence of cardiovascular diseases in the studied children's families reported previously which indicates the necessity to pay special attention to nutritional factors which are able to prevent the onset of the diseases in genetically predisposed children. Therefore, it was highly favourable that cholesterol content in the studied children's diets did not exceed the WHO recommendations.

### Exercise effects on lipids in persons with varying dietary patterns-does diet matter if they exercise? Responses in studies of a targeted risk reduction intervention through defined exercise I [^b6692739]. American Heart Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The standard clinical approach for reducing cardiovascular disease risk due to dyslipidemia is to prescribe changes in diet and physical activity. The purpose of the current study was to determine if, across a range of dietary patterns, there were variable lipoprotein responses to an aerobic exercise training intervention.

Methods

Subjects were participants in the STRRIDE I, a supervised exercise program in sedentary, overweight subjects randomized to 6 months of inactivity or 1 of 3 aerobic exercise programs. To characterize diet patterns observed during the study, we calculated a modified z-score that included intakes of total fat, saturated fat, trans fatty acids, cholesterol, omega-3 fatty acids, and fiber as compared with the 2006 American Heart Association diet recommendations. Linear models were used to evaluate relationships between diet patterns and exercise effects on lipoproteins/lipids.

Results

Independent of diet, exercise had beneficial effects on low-density lipoprotein cholesterol particle number, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol size, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol size, and triglycerides (P < .05 for all). However, having a diet pattern that closely adhered to American Heart Association recommendations was not related to changes in these or any other serum lipids or lipoproteins in any of the exercise groups.

Conclusions

We found that even in sedentary individuals whose habitual diets vary in the extent of adherence to AHA dietary recommendations, a rigorous, supervised exercise intervention can achieve significant beneficial lipid effects.

### Saturated fats and health: a Reassessment and proposal for food-based recommendations: JACC state-of-the-art review [^5dcc2235]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

The recommendation to limit dietary saturated fatty acid (SFA) intake has persisted despite mounting evidence to the contrary. Most recent meta-analyses of randomized trials and observational studies found no beneficial effects of reducing SFA intake on cardiovascular disease (CVD) and total mortality, and instead found protective effects against stroke. Although SFAs increase low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, in most individuals, this is not due to increasing levels of small, dense LDL particles, but rather larger LDL particles, which are much less strongly related to CVD risk. It is also apparent that the health effects of foods cannot be predicted by their content in any nutrient group without considering the overall macronutrient distribution. Whole-fat dairy, unprocessed meat, and dark chocolate are SFA-rich foods with a complex matrix that are not associated with increased risk of CVD. The totality of available evidence does not support further limiting the intake of such foods.

### Expert panel on integrated guidelines for cardiovascular health and risk reduction in children and adolescents: summary report [^fcb465f8]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Dietary fat intake in children and adolescents — evidence review concludes that a diet with total fat at less than 30 percent of calories, saturated fat less than 10 percent of calories, and cholesterol intake < 300 mg/d is safe for healthy children, with one large trial initiating this approach in infancy and reporting no harmful effects throughout childhood into adolescence. Nutritionist-delivered interventions safely achieved average total fat intake of 28–30 percent of calories and average saturated fat intake of 8–10 percent of calories, and these levels were shown in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to be associated with lower total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL–C) in intervention subjects versus controls. No harmful, adverse effects at these intake levels were demonstrated through several years of follow-up, with one RCT demonstrating no harm for as long as 14 years. The evidence review identified no RCT in which dietary fat intake of 30–35 percent was evaluated, and in the STRIP study the intervention group's total fat intake never exceeded 30.5 percent from ages 7 months to 14 years, with nutritionist-tailored diet interventions associated with no adverse events under trial conditions.

### Dietary advice for reducing cardiovascular risk [^2dd853dc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Changes in population diet are likely to reduce cardiovascular disease and cancer, but the effect of dietary advice is uncertain.

Objectives

To assess the effects of providing dietary advice to achieve sustained dietary changes or improved cardiovascular risk profile among healthy adults.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register on The Cochrane Library (Issue 2 2000), MEDLINE (January 1966 to December 2000), EMBASE (January 1985 to December 2000), DARE (December 2000), CAB Health (December 1999), dissertation abstracts, and reference lists of articles. We contacted researchers in the field.

Selection Criteria

Randomised studies with no more than 20% loss to follow-up, lasting at least three months involving healthy adults comparing dietary advice with no advice or less intensive advice. Trials involving children, trials to reduce weight or those involving supplementation were excluded.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Study authors were contacted for additional information.

Main Results

Twenty-three trials with 29 intervention arms (comparisons) comparing dietary advice with no advice were included in the review. Dietary advice reduced total serum cholesterol by 0.13 mmol/l (95% CI 0.03 to 0.23) and LDL cholesterol by 0.13 mmol/l (95% CI 0.01 to 0.25) after 3–12 months. Mean HDL cholesterol levels were unchanged. Dietary advice reduced blood pressure by 2.10 mmHg systolic (95% CI 1.37 to 2.83) and 1.63 mmHg diastolic (95% CI 0.56 to 2.71) and 24-hour urinary sodium excretion by 44.2 mmol (95% CI 33.6 to 54.7) after 3–36 months. Plasma triglycerides, ss-carotene and red cell folate were each measured in one small study which suggested no significant effect. Self-reported dietary intake may be subject to reporting bias, and there was significant heterogeneity in all the following analyses. Compared to no advice, dietary advice increased fruit and vegetable intake by 1.24 servings/day (95% CI 0.43 to 2.05). Dietary fibre intake increased with advice by 7.22 g/day (95% CI 2.84 to 11.60), while total dietary fat as a percentage of total energy intake fell by 6.18% (95% CI 4.00 to 8.36) with dietary advice and saturated fat intake fell by 3.28% (95% CI 1.92 to 4.64).

Authors' Conclusions

Dietary advice appears to be effective in bringing about modest beneficial changes in diet and cardiovascular risk factors over approximately 9 months but longer term effects are not known.

Serum cholesterol levels

Mean serum cholesterol levels decreased in all groups, control and intervention, except for the DART, where cholesterol levels were 1.2% higher in the control group after 2 years. This was unlikely to be clinically relevant. None of the reductions in mean serum cholesterol levels exceeded the critical difference of 19%, calculated by Fraser and Fogartyas the requirement for significance (p < 0.05).

Three studies alonereported SDs and significance for the start and end-of-study mean serum cholesterol levels. The one figure reported as statistically significant was the 14% reduction in mean serum cholesterol levels in the intervention group in the STARS (p < 0.001). The 8-year WHI studyreported the reductions in mean serum cholesterol levels in the intervention and control groups as 10.2 ± 32.0 mg/dL and 6.9 ± 31.9 mg/Dl, respectively, and reported the difference between the reductions, 3.26 mg/dL, as significant at p < 0.05 from a 2-sample test.

The standardised mean difference in serum cholesterol levels, for the 10 trials (12 interventions) combined, was −11.4% ± 6.5% for the intervention groups and −4.7% ± 4.8% for the control groups (table 1). The effect size was 1.18.

### 2023 AHA / ACC / ACCP / ASPC / NLA / PCNA guideline for the management of patients with chronic coronary disease: a report of the American Heart Association / American college of cardiology joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^7b057d00]. Circulation (2023). High credibility.

Recommended nutrition — plant-based and Mediterranean-based diets for chronic coronary disease (CCD) include reducing saturated fat and increasing monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats and complex carbohydrates; higher dietary fiber intake is associated with improvement in cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors and with a lower risk of CVD events and all-cause death. For patients at higher CVD risk, the American Heart Association (AHA) recommends lowering saturated fatty acids to < 6% of total caloric intake, and a recent Cochrane review of randomized trials that reduced saturated fat intake, altered dietary fats, or both highlighted a 17% reduction of CVD events in patients with CCD; among secondary prevention trials, the number needed to treat for an additional benefit was 53, by lowering saturated fat. Reduction in saturated fatty acids with healthier fat and carbohydrate intake lowers low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), which is associated with lower CVD morbidity and mortality, and a meta-analysis supports a dose-response relationship of higher quality carbohydrate intake and lower CVD-related morbidity and mortality rates.

### Recommended dietary pattern to achieve adherence to the American Heart Association / American college of cardiology (AHA / ACC) guidelines: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^453ae48b]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Mediterranean dietary pattern — composition, cardiometabolic risk factors, and outcomes: Fruits, vegetables, and whole grains contribute to a dietary fiber intake of 27 to 30 g/d, and the AHA/ACC lifestyle guideline designated "low evidence," concluding that counseling to eat a Mediterranean pattern resulted in no consistent effect on plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglycerides (TG), and cited "low evidence" for lowering systolic blood pressure (BP) by 6 to 7 mm Hg and diastolic BP by 2 to 3 mm Hg. In PREDIMED, participants were randomized to limited advice to lower total dietary fat (< 30% kcal total fat), extravirgin olive oil (50 g/d, equal to 425 kcal/d), or nuts (30 g/d, equal to 174 kcal/d, including 15 g/d walnuts, 7.5 g/d almonds, and 7.5 g/d hazelnuts) for 5 years; LDL-C was not significantly different among groups, while a significant 30% reduction in cardiovascular events was reported among the 2 Mediterranean diet groups. Greater adherence has been associated with reductions in coronary heart disease risk by 29% to 69% and reduced risk of a stroke by 13% to 53%, and meta-analyses reported a 10% reduction in risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) per 2-increment increase in adherence to the Mediterranean-style diet. The evidence for lowering saturated fatty acids (SFAs) to < 7% of total calories to reduce LDL-C is strong and justifies the American Heart Association (AHA) recommendation.

### Expert panel on integrated guidelines for cardiovascular health and risk reduction in children and adolescents: summary report [^cd22b9e1]. PES (2012). Medium credibility.

Pediatric fat intake limits — including hypercholesterolemia and infancy: Within appropriate age- and gender-based requirements and in normal children and in children with hypercholesterolemia, intake of total fat can be safely limited to 25 to 30 percent of total calories, saturated fat intake limited to 7–10 percent of calories, and dietary cholesterol limited to 300 mg/d, with this composition shown under qualified nutritionists to result in lower TC and LDL–C levels, less obesity, and less insulin resistance (Grade A). Under similar conditions and with ongoing follow-up, these levels of fat intake may have similar effects starting in infancy (Grade B), and fats are important to infants due to their role in brain and cognitive development; fat intake in infants younger than 12 months of age should not be restricted without medical indication. The remaining 20 percent of fat intake should comprise a combination of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats (Grade D), and intake of trans fat should be limited as much as possible (Grade D).

Plant sterols (PSs) for LDL-C lowering — mechanism, efficacy, and use: PSs lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) by reducing intestinal cholesterol absorption. Meta-analyses report reductions of 5–8% in LDL-C at ~2 g/day with a dose-response that plateaus at ~3 g/day. The European Atherosclerosis Society Consensus Panel found that 2 g/day lowered LDL-C by up to ~10% and recommended functional foods with added PSs for a variety of patients with elevated LDL-C levels, including those at low- to intermediate-risk who may not require pharmacotherapy, as an adjunct for patients on lipid-lowering pharmacotherapy who have not yet attained their therapeutic objective for LDL-C, and patients with familial hypercholesterolemia. PS products generally have the greatest LDL-C-lowering effect when consumed with meals, and the Panel acknowledged that there were no RCT data with CVD outcomes that established clinical benefit from the use of PSs.

### Egg consumption and risk of coronary heart disease and stroke: dose-response meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies [^2f959687]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Cardiovascular disease is now a public health crisis, affecting millions of people in both developed and developing countries. Although the rate of death attributable to the disease has declined in developed countries in the past several decades, it is still the leading cause of death and extorts a heavy social and economic toll globally. In low and middle income countries, the prevalence of cardiovascular disease has increased dramatically. By 2020, the disease is forecasted to be the major cause of morbidity and mortality in most developing nations.

In recent decades, concern has mounted regarding the high prevalence and costs associated with cardiovascular disease, with growing interest in altering risk factors and reversing this global epidemic. Among the known risk factors for cardiovascular disease, levels of low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol have aroused particular attention. In the Women's Health Study, after a mean follow-up of eight years, participants with the highest levels of LDL cholesterol showed a notably higher risk of cardiovascular events than those with the lowest levels. In addition, several meta-analyses of observational studies and randomized controlled trials have found that a reduction in concentrations of LDL cholesterol could significantly reduce the risk of coronary heart disease and stroke incidence and mortality. Diet is an important determinant of serum cholesterol, but dietary cholesterol has only a modest contribution to plasma concentrations of LDL cholesterol. On the other hand, dietary cholesterol may prompt the oxidation of LDL and increase postprandial lipemia, which could raise the risk of vascular disease. To minimize the elevation of blood cholesterol and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, the American Heart Association (AHA) has recommended the public to consume less than 300 mg/day of cholesterol.

Since eggs are a major source of dietary cholesterol, with one large egg containing almost 210 mg of cholesterol, the public has been recommended to limit egg consumption unless the intake of other foods high in cholesterol is restricted. However, eggs are also an inexpensive and low calorie source of many other nutrients, including minerals, proteins, and unsaturated fatty acids, which could lower the risk of cardiovascular disease. Additionally, in populations following a carbohydrate restricted diet, dietary cholesterol from eggs could increase plasma concentrations of high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, which has been suggested to protect against vascular disease. Therefore, some organizations have recommended that reducing egg intake might not be important for healthy people with normal levels of cholesterol in the blood. Food based dietary guidelines from countries including Nepal, Thailand, and South Africa recommend consuming eggs every day or regularly as part of a healthy diet.

### 2013 ACC / AHA cholesterol treatment guideline: what was done well and what could be done better [^d6e129d4]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Five years after convening the expert panel, the 2013 ACC/AHA Guideline on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol to Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Risk in Adults was released. The American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association issued the guideline on the basis of a systematic review of cholesterol treatment trials performed by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. This report critically appraises the guideline and provides our view of what was done well and what could be done better. In particular, we propose that the guideline succeeds in prioritizing statin therapy, expanding the focus to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (including stroke), and emphasizing absolute cardiovascular risk to determine eligibility for statin therapy. We contend that the guideline could be enhanced by refining the use of lipid goals rather than removing them, enhancing guidance on evaluation of cholesterol, and broadening the concept of age underpinning risk-based decision making to include vascular and physiological age. We further suggest that the next guideline panel could comprehensively review current best evidence, build on existing guidelines, and cultivate broader national and international consensus. Overall, we aim to continue discussions about the important contributions and shortfalls of the guideline and create momentum for effective implementation and timely updates.

### Reduction in saturated fat intake for cardiovascular disease [^f78c6fd3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Reducing saturated fat reduces serum cholesterol, but effects on other intermediate outcomes may be less clear. Additionally, it is unclear whether the energy from saturated fats eliminated from the diet are more helpfully replaced by polyunsaturated fats, monounsaturated fats, carbohydrate or protein.

Objectives

To assess the effect of reducing saturated fat intake and replacing it with carbohydrate (CHO), polyunsaturated (PUFA), monounsaturated fat (MUFA) and/or protein on mortality and cardiovascular morbidity, using all available randomised clinical trials.

Search Methods

We updated our searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (Ovid) and Embase (Ovid) on 15 October 2019, and searched Clinicaltrials.gov and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) on 17 October 2019.

Selection Criteria

Included trials fulfilled the following criteria: 1) randomised; 2) intention to reduce saturated fat intake OR intention to alter dietary fats and achieving a reduction in saturated fat; 3) compared with higher saturated fat intake or usual diet; 4) not multifactorial; 5) in adult humans with or without cardiovascular disease (but not acutely ill, pregnant or breastfeeding); 6) intervention duration at least 24 months; 7) mortality or cardiovascular morbidity data available.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed inclusion, extracted study data and assessed risk of bias. We performed random-effects meta-analyses, meta-regression, subgrouping, sensitivity analyses, funnel plots and GRADE assessment.

Main Results

We included 15 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (16 comparisons, 56,675 participants), that used a variety of interventions from providing all food to advice on reducing saturated fat. The included long-term trials suggested that reducing dietary saturated fat reduced the risk of combined cardiovascular events by 17% (risk ratio (RR) 0.83; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.70 to 0.98, 12 trials, 53,758 participants of whom 8% had a cardiovascular event, I² = 67%, GRADE moderate-quality evidence). Meta-regression suggested that greater reductions in saturated fat (reflected in greater reductions in serum cholesterol) resulted in greater reductions in risk of CVD events, explaining most heterogeneity between trials. The number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) was 56 in primary prevention trials, so 56 people need to reduce their saturated fat intake for ~four years for one person to avoid experiencing a CVD event. In secondary prevention trials, the NNTB was 53. Subgrouping did not suggest significant differences between replacement of saturated fat calories with polyunsaturated fat or carbohydrate, and data on replacement with monounsaturated fat and protein was very limited. We found little or no effect of reducing saturated fat on all-cause mortality (RR 0.96; 95% CI 0.90 to 1.03; 11 trials, 55,858 participants) or cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.95; 95% CI 0.80 to 1.12, 10 trials, 53,421 participants), both with GRADE moderate-quality evidence. There was little or no effect of reducing saturated fats on non-fatal myocardial infarction (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.07) or CHD mortality (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.16, both low-quality evidence), but effects on total (fatal or non-fatal) myocardial infarction, stroke and CHD events (fatal or non-fatal) were all unclear as the evidence was of very low quality. There was little or no effect on cancer mortality, cancer diagnoses, diabetes diagnosis, HDL cholesterol, serum triglycerides or blood pressure, and small reductions in weight, serum total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and BMI. There was no evidence of harmful effects of reducing saturated fat intakes.

Authors' Conclusions

The findings of this updated review suggest that reducing saturated fat intake for at least two years causes a potentially important reduction in combined cardiovascular events. Replacing the energy from saturated fat with polyunsaturated fat or carbohydrate appear to be useful strategies, while effects of replacement with monounsaturated fat are unclear. The reduction in combined cardiovascular events resulting from reducing saturated fat did not alter by study duration, sex or baseline level of cardiovascular risk, but greater reduction in saturated fat caused greater reductions in cardiovascular events.

### Dietary intakes of eggs and cholesterol in relation to all-cause and heart disease mortality: a prospective cohort study [^2ede089a]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

In our study, we did not find a significant association between dietary cholesterol intake and heart disease mortality. The results are consistent with those of several previous studies on CVD mortality and also in a systematic review of 19 studies with 361 923 participants, which did not identify significant associations with incident coronary heart disease, ischemic stroke, or hemorrhagic stroke. 36 Although increased dietary cholesterol intake was thought to modestly increase serum total and low‐density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol as well as LDL/high‐density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol ratio, 37 such an effect may not substantially increase the risk of CVD. This was demonstrated in a meta‐analysis of 17 trials, where 100 mg/day dietary cholesterol only increased total cholesterol by 0.056 mmol/L (2.2 mg/dL) and the LDL/HDL cholesterol ratio by 0.020 unit. 37 Cholesterol homeostasis is maintained constant through a compensatory mechanism, 38 and increased intake of dietary cholesterol is associated with decreased synthesis of endogenous cholesterol. In the pooling study of 6 US cohorts, Zhong et al 11 reported positive and monotonic associations between dietary cholesterol intake and risk of all‐cause mortality and incident CVD, even after adjustment for saturated fat, red meat, and other nutrients or foods consistently found to be related to risk of CVD and premature death. 39, 40, 41, 42 However, we observed a nonlinear U‐shaped association between dietary cholesterol and all‐cause mortality, and the weakly positive association was only restricted to participants with a daily intake ≥ 250 mg. The result raises concerns over whether the association between dietary cholesterol and increased all‐cause mortality depends on the baseline cholesterol consumption levels. Although our results among individuals with high consumption levels are in part consistent with those of Zhong et al, 11 there is still a possibility of residual confounding from foods and nutrients that may increase risk of mortality. Our findings need to be validated in other similar prospective studies to achieve consensus about the optimal intake levels of dietary cholesterol.
