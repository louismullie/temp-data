## Question

is lamotrigine better at treating depressive cycles than valproic acid

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether lamotrigine is better than valproic acid for treating depressive cycles in bipolar disorder. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "depressive cycles" means clinically (acute bipolar depression versus prevention of depressive relapse). Then, I should verify the regulatory status and labeled indications for lamotrigine and valproate. Next, I will review head-to-head and placebo-controlled evidence for acute bipolar depression, followed by maintenance-phase data. After that, I need to check guideline positions and weigh tolerability and drug–drug interactions. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, clinically grounded conclusion with caveats and monitoring needs.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame. "Depressive cycles" in bipolar disorder typically refers to two related but distinct goals: treating an acute bipolar depressive episode and preventing recurrence of depressive episodes during maintenance therapy. I need to ensure I separate these because the evidentiary strength differs by phase and by agent, and conflating them could mislead the conclusion.

> I will now examine regulatory status to anchor expectations. Lamotrigine is FDA-approved for maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder to delay mood episodes, with stronger evidence for delaying depressive episodes than mania, and it is not approved for acute bipolar depression or acute mania. Valproate (divalproex/valproic acid) is FDA-approved for acute mania/mixed episodes and for maintenance in some formulations, but it is not specifically approved for acute bipolar depression. Hold on, I should verify that I'm not overstating valproate's depressive indications — yes, its labeled maintenance claim is more limited and does not specifically target prevention of depressive episodes, whereas lamotrigine's label and pivotal trials emphasize delaying depressive recurrences [^112XGdU1] [^114VWFDN] [^111gfhv5].

> Next, I should review acute bipolar depression data for lamotrigine. Wait, let me verify the monotherapy signal. Five randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of lamotrigine monotherapy for acute bipolar depression failed to separate from placebo on primary endpoints, though some secondary measures favored lamotrigine in one study. This argues against lamotrigine monotherapy for acute bipolar depression despite occasional signals, so I should not jump to conclusions favoring it acutely [^1166YUEm]. But hold on, adjunctive data look different: when lamotrigine is added to lithium, there is a modest but significant improvement in depressive symptoms and response rates, suggesting a role as augmentation rather than monotherapy in acute depression. Similarly, in CEQUEL, adding lamotrigine to quetiapine produced a small improvement in depressive symptoms at 12 weeks and a larger benefit at 52 weeks, with an intriguing interaction whereby folic acid may blunt lamotrigine's effect, so I need to keep that interaction in mind [^1155pfm9] [^116GDwQv] [^115c89P4].

> Now, I should review valproate for acute bipolar depression. I need to check whether there are robust RCTs. The evidence base for valproate in acute bipolar depression is limited and generally negative or inconclusive in monotherapy trials, with no consistent superiority to placebo on primary depressive outcomes. Some reviews describe valproate as modestly effective at best for bipolar depression, reinforcing that it is not a strong choice for acute depressive episodes compared with agents like quetiapine, lurasidone, or lithium combinations. So, for acute bipolar depression, neither lamotrigine nor valproate has strong standalone evidence, but lamotrigine has clearer augmentation signals than valproate [^1168Qgix].

> Next, I should review maintenance-phase evidence, because that is where lamotrigine's profile is most distinct. Large, placebo-controlled maintenance trials show lamotrigine delays time to intervention for mood episodes and is particularly robust in delaying depressive episodes, with about 57% of patients remaining free of depressive intervention at 1 year versus 45% on placebo, while lithium is stronger for preventing mania. Pooled analyses and Cochrane data confirm lamotrigine's superiority to placebo for preventing relapse and its similar overall maintenance efficacy to lithium, albeit with relatively less antimanic protection. This pattern supports lamotrigine's niche in preventing depressive recurrences [^116vvfka] [^111zXUpk] [^113MfWrV] [^112F6Pq9].

> I should double-check valproate's maintenance data for depressive polarity. Cochrane suggests valproate reduces overall mood episode relapse versus placebo but does not demonstrate a clear, consistent advantage for preventing depressive episodes specifically, and comparative maintenance trials often show lithium or lamotrigine outperform valproate on depressive outcomes. Network meta-analyses also rank lamotrigine higher than valproate for preventing depressive relapses, reinforcing that valproate is less reliable for the depressive pole in maintenance therapy [^111zMXAf] [^1162GT9K].

> Next, I should review guidelines to ensure my interpretation aligns with consensus. The VA/DoD guideline recommends lamotrigine to prevent recurrence of bipolar depressive episodes with moderate-to-strong evidence confidence, while advising against lamotrigine monotherapy to prevent mania and noting insufficient evidence for lamotrigine monotherapy in acute bipolar depression. CANMAT/ISBD list lamotrigine as a first-line maintenance option with particular value for depressive polarity, and they also position lamotrigine as an adjunctive option in acute bipolar depression. In contrast, valproate is not highlighted as a preferred agent for preventing depressive recurrences in these guidelines, which instead emphasize antimanic and broad maintenance roles rather than depressive-pole specificity [^1141LNbd] [^111Fg6wz] [^115m8nwC] [^114oQq4h].

> I need to ensure tolerability and interactions are weighed appropriately. Lamotrigine is generally well tolerated but carries a rare risk of serious rash (SJS/TEN) mitigated by slow titration over about 6 weeks, which can delay benefit. Valproate commonly causes weight gain, sedation, tremor, and has a narrower therapeutic index requiring serum monitoring; importantly, valproate inhibits lamotrigine glucuronidation, roughly doubling lamotrigine levels and increasing rash risk, necessitating lower lamotrigine doses when combined. These factors can influence adherence and safety, especially in long-term maintenance strategies [^117V8ZJK] [^117AcVFR] [^1168Qgix].

> Let me synthesize and make sure I'm not overgeneralizing. For acute bipolar depression, neither lamotrigine nor valproate has strong monotherapy evidence, but lamotrigine shows a modest signal as adjunctive therapy (notably with lithium or quetiapine), whereas valproate lacks consistent acute antidepressant efficacy. For preventing depressive recurrences, lamotrigine has robust, replicated evidence of benefit and is guideline-endorsed for this specific purpose, while valproate's evidence for preventing depressive episodes is weaker and less consistent. Therefore, if the clinical question targets depressive cycles in the maintenance phase, lamotrigine is the better-supported choice; if the question targets acute bipolar depression, neither is ideal as monotherapy, but lamotrigine has a more favorable adjunctive profile than valproate [^1166YUEm] [^1155pfm9] [^116GDwQv] [^113MfWrV] [^1141LNbd] [^111zMXAf].

> But wait, what if the patient has frequent manic episodes or requires rapid antimanic stabilization? In that scenario, valproate's stronger antimanic and anti-mixed efficacy may make it the more appropriate anchor, with lamotrigine added later for depressive-pole prophylaxis once euthymia is achieved. I should confirm dosing adjustments: when combining with valproate, lamotrigine must be titrated more slowly to a lower target (typically 100 mg/day) to mitigate interaction-related rash risk, and dose changes should follow the labeled schedules during co-therapy or when valproate is discontinued [^117V8ZJK] [^113bhCfu].

> Final clinical take: Yes, lamotrigine is generally better than valproic acid for treating and preventing depressive cycles in bipolar disorder, particularly for maintenance prevention of depressive episodes, where the evidence is strongest and guideline support is consistent. For acute bipolar depression, neither agent excels as monotherapy, but lamotrigine has more credible augmentation data than valproate. Valproate remains valuable for mania and mixed states, so individualized selection and rational combination therapy are often necessary to optimize across poles of illness [^113MfWrV] [^1141LNbd] [^111zMXAf] [^1149W4nV].

Lamotrigine is **superior to valproic acid for preventing depressive episodes** in bipolar disorder, with robust evidence for delaying depressive relapse and a favorable tolerability profile [^113MfWrV] [^111Eq1aq]. Valproic acid is **more effective for acute mania** and has a less favorable side-effect profile, including weight gain and sedation [^111zMXAf] [^111Eq1aq]. For acute bipolar depression, lamotrigine shows modest efficacy as adjunctive therapy but is not effective as monotherapy; valproic acid has minimal antidepressant effect. Guidelines recommend lamotrigine for maintenance to prevent depressive episodes, while valproic acid is preferred for acute mania or mixed states.

## Clinical evidence for lamotrigine in depressive cycles

### Acute bipolar depression

- **Monotherapy**: Lamotrigine monotherapy shows modest efficacy in acute bipolar depression, with a small but significant benefit over placebo in some trials [^113PEYDX].
- **Adjunctive therapy**: Lamotrigine as adjunctive therapy (e.g. with lithium or quetiapine) improves depressive symptoms and increases response rates, though evidence quality is low to moderate [^111gWx4D] [^1155pfm9] [^116GDwQv].
- **Limitations**: Slow titration delays onset, limiting acute utility [^111wCovR].

---

### Maintenance treatment

- **Preventing depressive relapse**: Lamotrigine significantly delays depressive relapse versus placebo and is comparable to lithium for depressive episodes [^113MfWrV] [^111zXUpk] [^116vvfka].
- **Tolerability**: Generally well tolerated; serious rash (SJS/TEN) is rare with slow titration [^113MfWrV] [^117V8ZJK].
- **Guideline support**: Strongly recommended for maintenance to prevent depressive episodes [^1141LNbd] [^111Fg6wz].

---

## Clinical evidence for valproic acid in depressive cycles

### Acute bipolar depression

Limited efficacy: Valproic acid has **minimal antidepressant effect** in acute bipolar depression and is not recommended as a first-line treatment for this indication [^1168Qgix] [^115m8nwC].

---

### Maintenance treatment

- **General relapse prevention**: Valproic acid prevents overall mood episode relapse but is less effective than lamotrigine for depressive episodes [^111zMXAf].
- **Side effects**: Weight gain, sedation, and metabolic effects limit long-term use [^111zMXAf] [^117WVWi6].
- **Guideline support**: Recommended for maintenance, but less specific for depressive relapse prevention than lamotrigine [^111Fg6wz].

---

## Comparative efficacy and tolerability

| **Aspect** | **Lamotrigine** | **Valproic acid** |
|-|-|-|
| Acute bipolar depression | Modest efficacy; better as adjunctive therapy | Minimal efficacy |
| Maintenance (depressive episodes) | Strong efficacy; delays relapse significantly | Limited efficacy for depressive relapse |
| Acute mania | Ineffective | Effective |
| Tolerability | Generally well tolerated; rare serious rash | Weight gain, sedation, metabolic effects |
| Guideline support | Strong for depressive relapse prevention | General maintenance support |

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Lamotrigine is **strongly recommended for maintenance** to prevent depressive episodes, while valproic acid is preferred for acute mania or mixed states. Lamotrigine is favored for patients with predominantly depressive polarity or rapid cycling, whereas valproic acid is chosen for prominent manic symptoms or when lamotrigine is contraindicated.

---

## Patient-specific considerations

- **Depressive polarity**: Lamotrigine is preferred for frequent depressive episodes.
- **Manic polarity**: Valproic acid is preferred for frequent manic episodes.
- **Comorbidities**: Valproic acid may be less suitable in patients with obesity, metabolic syndrome, or pregnancy risk.
- **Tolerability**: Lamotrigine is better tolerated long-term for many patients [^111Eq1aq].

---

Lamotrigine is **superior to valproic acid for preventing depressive episodes**, with stronger evidence and better tolerability, whereas valproic acid remains superior for acute mania. Treatment should be individualized based on illness polarity, comorbidities, and patient preferences.

Lamotrigine for acute bipolar depression — We suggest lamotrigine in combination with lithium or quetiapine for acute bipolar depression, and the Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence on the effectiveness of adjunctive therapy with lamotrigine was very low with the recommendation categorized as Reviewed, New-added. In general, lamotrigine is well tolerated, but its use is associated with the rare occurrence of a serious and potentially fatal dermatological condition, SJS/TEN, and based on guidance from FDA approved product labeling, minimizing this risk requires that lamotrigine treatment starts at low, subtherapeutic doses with slow titration over 6 weeks to effective target doses. Overall, though, the Work Group concluded that, the benefits of adjunctive treatment with lamotrigine for individuals with bipolar depression outweigh the harms and burdens. In addition to its effectiveness as an adjunctive treatment of acute bipolar depression, lamotrigine has also demonstrated effectiveness as a monotherapy for the prevention of recurrent episodes of bipolar depression in BD 1 but not for mania, and early use during an acute episode might simplify long-term management by establishing a treatment regimen effective for maintenance as well as acute treatment.

Although treatment guidelines have commonly recommended maintenance therapy with lamotrigine or quetiapine as first‐line treatments in bipolar disorder patients at risk for depressive episode recurrence, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 there clearly is a need for additional options that are safe, well‐tolerated, and effective for the maintenance therapy of bipolar disorder patients at risk for depression recurrence.

Lurasidone has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of acute bipolar depression, both as monotherapy, and as adjunctive therapy with lithium or valproate. Three randomized, double‐blind, 6‐week trials have been completed, a monotherapy trial comparing two flexible‐fixed doses of lurasidone (20–60 mg/day; 80–120 mg/day), 23 and two flexible dose trials of lurasidone (20–120 mg/day) administered adjunctively with lithium or valproate. 24, 25 We report here the results of the 6‐month, open‐label, uncontrolled extension of the three 6‐week studies, designed to evaluate long‐term safety and tolerability of lurasidone in patients with bipolar depression. A secondary aim was to evaluate the effectiveness of lurasidone in maintaining improvement in depressive symptoms.

### Valproate as a risk factor for lamotrigine discontinuation [^116NGMW1]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Although lamotrigine may be useful for treating bipolar depressive patients, some lamotrigine-associated adverse effects may prevent the continuation of treatment. The purpose of the present study was to identify risk factors for lamotrigine discontinuation after adjustment for several potential interactive factors.

Methods

We examined tolerability in those who discontinued lamotrigine within 2 months of treatment and those who maintained lamotrigine for more than 2 months. Groups were examined separately because 6–8 weeks are necessary to titrate dose and drug eruptions can often occur within 2 months of treatment commencement.

Results

Multiple regression analysis revealed that valproate combination was positively and significantly associated with lamotrigine discontinuation after adjustment for other factors.

Limitations

The limitations of the present study were retrospective observation and a relatively small number of subjects.

Conclusions

The present findings reconfirm that lamotrigine and valproate combination treatment may prevent the continuation of lamotrigine in some patients.

### Comparative effectiveness of valproic acid in different serum concentrations for maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder: a retrospective cohort study using target trial emulation framework [^117AcVFR]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Bipolar disorder (BD) is a serious mental disorder associated with high rates of disability, suicide, and mortality. Prevention of major depressive or manic episode recurrence is a major challenge for the long-term management of BD. Therefore, maintenance treatment after management of acute mood episodes is a crucial step for the prevention of the recurrence of major affective episodes. Mood stabilisers such as valproic acid (VPA) remain the mainstay treatment of choice during the maintenance phase. Multiple studies have shown VPA's consistent effectiveness to prevent patients' mood recurrence and improve patients' quality of life when used as maintenance treatment for BD, making it a common drug choice for stable patients with BD.

Although VPA may be effective in preventing the recurrence of any mood episode during maintenance treatment, treatment with VPA requires routine monitoring of serum concentration due to its narrow therapeutic index and potential drug interaction. VPA has been known to increase the sedative effects of neuroleptics and benzodiazepines, and also to inhibit the metabolism of lamotrigine. Furthermore, VPA exhibits a complex pharmacokinetic profile due to concentration-dependent protein binding and clearance characteristics that have been shown to vary among patients of different age groups. In the past, few studies have assessed the optimal (i.e. the most efficacious) range of serum VPA concentrations for the maintenance treatment of patients with BD. Current major guidelines (e.g. the British Association for Psychopharmacology (BAP) guideline,2018 Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) and International Society for Bipolar Disorders (ISBD) guidelines, and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guideline) either lack suggestions for an optimal serum VPA concentration or simply suggest maintaining a serum VPA concentration within accepted laboratory values, such as 50–100 μg/ml, highlighting the need for further research.

4.4.3 Step 3: add on or switch therapy (alternate first‐line agents)

Across several different medications for bipolar depression, early improvement (after 2 weeks) has been found to be a reasonable predictor of overall response, whereas lack of early improvement is a more robust predictor of non‐response. 255 Lamotrigine is the exception to this rule, given a necessary slow titration initiating the medication. In the case of non‐response, dosing should be optimized and issues of non‐adherence identified and addressed (see Section 2) prior to adjusting treatment strategies.

When determining whether an agent should be switched or another first‐line agent be added on to any current treatment, the effectiveness of each of the medications needs to be understood in the context of all the goals of managing BD. It is often the case that a medication may be selected to address several goals; for instance, lithium could be added for acute depression with intent to also bolster anti‐manic prophylaxis. In this scenario, if lithium is ineffective in the individual patient for an acute bipolar depression but is also being used over the long term for anti‐manic prophylaxis, then an "add‐on" intervention should be the next treatment for the acute bipolar depression. If, for instance, the anti‐manic prophylaxis is already being fully provided by an atypical antipsychotic, then the new medication could replace lithium via a switch strategy. Decision‐making must also address efficacy for comorbid conditions, as well as tolerability concerns. In principle, all things being equal, a switch is preferred over add‐on to limit the degree of polypharmacy, but the clinical reality is that medications may be helpful for some but not all components of the illness, and using rational polypharmacy via add‐on treatments is often required. For situations in which patients experience a depressive episode while already receiving an adequately dosed antidepressant, strong consideration should be given to discontinuing or switching the class of antidepressant, unless clear benefits are apparent in reducing the severity or frequency of depressive episodes. Switch of medications should be done in an overlap and taper manner unless there is medical necessity for abrupt discontinuation. 257

All first‐line options should be tried in adequate doses for an adequate duration of time before considering second‐line options either as an add‐on or switch strategy.

### Lamotrigine update and its use in mood disorders [^113oyAbZ]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To provide a qualitative, systematic update and review of the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, efficacy in mood disorders, adverse effects, and costs of lamotrigine.

Data Sources

Citations obtained from MEDLINE searches (1985-September 2001) using lamotrigine as a text word, articles identified in reference lists of pertinent articles, abstracts presented at conferences, and research data from GlaxoSmithKline.

Data Extraction

English-language articles were considered for possible inclusion. Each title and abstract was examined to determine whether the publication contained up-to-date information relevant to the objective. Twenty clinical trials that provided data on response rates in mood disorders were tabulated.

Data Synthesis

Lamotrigine's primary action is to modulate voltage-gated sodium channels. Evidence suggests that it decreases glutamate transmission, directly reduces calcium influx, mildly blocks transmitter reuptake, and alters intracellular mechanisms of resting transmitter release. The average half-life of lamotrigine is approximately 24 hours, but decreases to approximately 7.4 hours when used concurrently with phenytoin, and increases to approximately 59 hours with valproic acid. Seven of the 20 clinical trials were randomized, double-blind, and controlled. Existing data are inadequate to evaluate lamotrigine use in major depression. The pooled response rates for patients with depressed, manic, mixed, and rapid cycling bipolar disorder were similar, ranging from 52% to 63%. Adverse effects are infrequent when the drug is used alone, but become more frequent when lamotrigine is combined with other anticonvulsants. While most rashes are mild, approximately 1 in 500 patients develops exfoliative dermatitis. A slow upward dose titration is recommended to reduce the incidence of serious rash, but this may delay the attainment of adequate dosage for 6 weeks. Lamotrigine has positive effects on cognitive function, but occasionally produces insomnia. Lamotrigine costs 2–4 times more than lithium, carbamazepine, and generic valproic acid.

Conclusions

When efficacy, adverse effects, and cost are considered, lamotrigine should probably be reserved as a second-line agent for bipolar depression.

### Separate and concomitant use of lamotrigine, lithium, and divalproex in bipolar disorders [^111XAXvz]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2004). Low credibility.

Expert consensus emphasizes the need for better recognition and accurate diagnosis of bipolar disorder. Current research on lithium, divalproex, and lamotrigine provides new insight into the effective management of this illness. Advances in identifying the mechanism of action of mood stabilization has focused on signaling pathways within the cell that are associated with neurotrophic effects. Clinical research has led to confirmatory evidence of the efficacy of lithium in all phases of bipolar disorder, with the greatest effects seen in the treatment and prevention of mania. Compared to divalproex, lithium also has been found to have greater efficacy in the prevention of suicide. Lamotrigine has emerged as a first line treatment for bipolar depression, which is an area of weakness for other mood stabilizers. Oral loading of divalproex leads to rapid stabilization of mania without imposing a greater adverse effect burden than conventional dosing. Because no agent is universally effective in all phases of the illness, combination therapy with two or more agents often is the best option.

### Randomized, double-blind pilot trial comparing lamotrigine versus citalopram for the treatment of bipolar depression [^114wGZDj]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Uncertainty exists regarding the best approach for treating bipolar depression among patients already receiving a first-line mood stabilizer. The aim of this pilot study was to compare adding a second mood stabilizer or an antidepressant at this treatment decision point.

Methods

Twelve-week, randomized, double-blind pilot trial comparing the addition of lamotrigine or citalopram for bipolar depressed patients on mood stabilizer medication. Change in depressive symptoms and risk of switch were examined.

Results

Twenty subjects were randomized. Each treatment group experienced a significant mean reduction in total MADRS scores (citalopram Delta - 14.2, p = 0.002; lamotrigine Delta - 13.3, p = 0.001), and there was no significant difference between treatment groups (p = 0.78). Total response rates increased from 31.6% at week 6 to 52.6% at week 12. One out of ten patients in each group experienced a switch to hypomania.

Limitations

Small sample size. Lack of a placebo arm.

Conclusions

Results of this small trial suggest that both lamotrigine and citalopram appear to be reasonable choices as add-on acute treatment for bipolar depression, with response rates continuing to rise considerably past 6 weeks of treatment.

VA/DoD bipolar disorder guideline — lamotrigine monotherapy for acute bipolar depression reports that Bahji et al. (2020) reviewed 'six placebo-controlled clinical trials with very low GRADE evidence' and found 'No significant drug-placebo differences for changes in depressive symptoms'.Across analyses lamotrigine was 'associated with increased rates of treatment response and remission', and in BD 1 studies it was 'associated with increased rates of response but not with remission'.Given 'the very low quality of the evidence', it states 'it is impossible to conclude that the benefits of lamotrigine monotherapy for the treatment of acute bipolar depression outweigh the harms'.

### An observational nationwide register based cohort study on lamotrigine versus lithium in bipolar disorder [^116FReB2]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2012). Low credibility.

It is not clear whether the effectiveness of lamotrigine versus lithium differs for patients with bipolar disorder treated in clinical practice. We compared rates of switch to, or add on of, another psychotropic, and rates of psychiatric hospitalization for patients treated with lamotrigine or lithium in clinical practice. Using linkage of nationwide Danish registers we identified 730 patients who received lamotrigine and 3518 patients received lithium subsequent to a diagnosis of bipolar disorder in psychiatric hospital settings during a period from 1995 to 2006. The overall rate of switch to or add on of another psychotropic (the opposite drug of interest (lithium or lamotrigine), antidepressants, antipsychotics or other anticonvulsants than lamotrigine) was increased for lamotrigine compared with lithium (HR = 2.60, 95% CI: 2.23–3.04), regardless of whether the index episode was depressive, manic, mixed or remission. In addition, the overall rate of psychiatric hospitalization was increased for lamotrigine compared with lithium (HR = 1.45, 95% CI: 1.28–1.65), as were the rates for patients with a depressive (HR = 1.31, 95% CI: 1.01–1.70) and patients with a manic (HR = 1.65, 95% CI: 1.31–2.09) index episode. Rates did not differ significantly between the drugs for patients with a mixed index episode and for patients in remission. It is concluded that in daily clinical practice, treatment with lithium is in general superior to treatment with lamotrigine.

### Evidence-based guidelines for bipolar disorder therapy… [^117WVWi6]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

Lithium was the earliest mood-stabilizing medication and still is used extensively. The efficacy of lithium is well established in patients who are in manic states, and it is known to reduce the rates of suicide. Lithium is most effective in patients who have little comorbidity and do not cycle rapidly. Patients who are likely not to respond well to lithium include those with frequent previous episodes, rapid cycling, depressive and anxious symptoms during the manic phase, substance abuse, and medical conditions. The second-generation antiepileptic drugs divalproex and carbamazepine are highly effective in patients with acute mania, but have less effect in patients with depression and in the prevention of symptom recurrence.

These drugs are useful in patients who do not respond to lithium, but their use is limited by side effects such as weight gain and sedation, as well as multiple drug-drug interactions and the need to monitor blood levels of the drug along with hepatic and hematologic indexes. Conversely, the third-generation antiepileptic drug lamotrigine is effective in the treatment of depression and the prevention of recurrence, and does not require blood monitoring. The major problem with lamotrigine is a rash that develops in up to 10 percent of patients and can progress to Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Fewer data are available about other third-generation antiepileptic drugs. Gabapentin is useful for anxiety symptoms, and topiramate may improve depressive states. Oxcarbazepine may provide many of the antimania and antidepressant effects of carbamazepine with fewer side effects and drug interactions.

These actions appear to be independent of the antipsychotic effects of these drugs, and most bipolar patients benefit at low dosages. This group of drugs may be particularly effective as adjunctive therapy with antidepressants in patients with bipolar depression and in maintenance therapy, when combined with lithium or divalproex. The biggest disadvantage of the novel antipsychotics is weight gain; lipid and glucose abnormalities also occur.

### Lamotrigine (Subvenite) [^111LVcb9]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.4 Bipolar Disorder

The goal of maintenance treatment with SUBVENITE is to delay the time to occurrence of mood episodes (depression, mania, hypomania, mixed episodes) in patients treated for acute mood episodes with standard therapy [see Indications and Usage (1.2)].

Patients taking SUBVENITE for more than 16 weeks should be periodically reassessed to determine the need for maintenance treatment.

Adults

The target dose of SUBVENITE is 200 mg/day (100 mg/day in patients taking valproate, which decreases the apparent clearance of lamotrigine, and 400 mg/day in patients not taking valproate and taking either carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, or other drugs such as rifampin and the protease inhibitor lopinavir/ritonavir that increase the apparent clearance of lamotrigine). In the clinical trials, doses up to 400 mg/day as monotherapy were evaluated; however, no additional benefit was seen at 400 mg/day compared with 200 mg/day [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. Accordingly, doses above 200 mg/day are not recommended.

Treatment with SUBVENITE is introduced, based on concurrent medications, according to the regimen outlined in Table 5. If other psychotropic medications are withdrawn following stabilization, the dose of SUBVENITE should be adjusted. In patients discontinuing valproate, the dose of SUBVENITE should be doubled over a 2-week period in equal weekly increments (see Table 6). In patients discontinuing carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, or other drugs such as rifampin and the protease inhibitors lopinavir/ritonavir and atazanavir/ritonavir that induce lamotrigine glucuronidation, the dose of SUBVENITE should remain constant for the first week and then should be decreased by half over a 2-week period in equal weekly decrements (see Table 6). The dose of SUBVENITE may then be further adjusted to the target dose (200 mg) as clinically indicated.

### New treatment guidelines for acute bipolar depression: a systematic review [^112iy3Ff]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Bipolar depression poses a great burden on patients and their families due to its duration, associated functional impairment, and limited treatment options. Given the complexity of the disorder and the advances in treatment, a number of clinical guidelines, consensus statements and expert opinions were developed with the aim to standardize treatment and provide clinicians with treatment algorithms for every-day clinical practice. Unfortunately, they often led to conflicting conclusions and recommendations due to limitations of the available literature. As findings emerge from research literature, guidelines quickly become obsolete and need to be updated or revised. Many guidelines have been updated in the last 5 years, after the last review of bipolar disorder (BD) treatment guidelines.

Objective

The purpose of this work is to systematically review guidelines, consensus meetings and treatment algorithms on the acute treatment of bipolar depression updated or published since 2005, to critically underline common and critical points, highlight limits and strengths, and provide a starting point for future research

Materials and Methods

The MEDLINe/PubMed/Index Medicus, PsycINFO/PsycLIT, Excerpta Medica/EMBASE, databases were searched using "depression", "bipolar", "manic-depression", "manic-depressive" and "treatment guidelines" as key words

Results

The search returned 204 articles. Amongst them, there were 28 papers concerning structured treatment algorithms and/or guidelines suggested by official panels. After excluding those guidelines that were not performed by scientific societies or international groups and those published before 2005, the final selection yielded 7 papers When looking into guidelines content, the results indicate a trend to the gradual acceptance of the use of the atypical antipsychotic quetiapine as monotherapy as first-line treatment. Antidepressant monotherapy is discouraged in most of them, although some support the use of antidepressants in combination with antimanic agents for a limited period of time. Lamotrigine has become a highly controversial option.

Conclusion

The management of bipolar depression is complex and should be differentiated from management of unipolar depression. Guidelines may be useful instruments for helping clinicians to choose and plan bipolar depression treatment by integrating the more updated scientific knowledge with every-day clinical practice and patient-specific factors; however, a further effort is needed in order to improve guidelines implementation in clinical practice. The latest updates on treatment guidelines for bipolar depression give priority to novel treatment approaches, such as quetiapine, over more traditional ones, such as lithium or antidepressants. Lamotrigine is a controversial option.

### New treatment guidelines for acute bipolar mania: a critical review [^113Qp1L2]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2012). Low credibility.

A number of treatment guidelines for bipolar disorder have been published and updated in the last few years. They are aimed at providing a synthesis of the best available scientific knowledge, and their application to every-day work should be helpful to clinicians. The aim of this report is to critically review recent guidelines focusing on the treatment of manic/hypomanic and mixed episodes. Guidelines are quite heterogeneous in methodology and conclusions, but they all agree that the treatment of manic/hypomanic and mixed episodes should generally be initiated with a medication such as lithium (Li), valproate (VPA) or atypical antipsychotics (AAP), including aripiprazole, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, and ziprasidone as monotherapy. All guidelines agree on stopping ongoing antidepressant medication during mania. Combination therapy including Li or VPA with an AAP is suggested usually as second-line choice, sometimes as first-choice treatment for severe mania. Carbamazepine is mostly suggested as second line and not recommended in combination. Other antiepileptic drugs are not recommended for the treatment of mania, although lamotrigine may be maintained if it was prescribed previously for the prevention of depressive episodes. Main sources of discrepancies among guidelines include benefit-risk ratio issues (how much priority is given to efficacy over safety and tolerability), starting with combination versus monotherapy, and how to deal with treatments which are more experience-based than evidence-based (i.e.: electroconvulsive therapy).

### Anticonvulsants in bipolar disorders: current research and practice and future directions [^117KXAUi]. Bipolar Disorders (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine the clinical effectiveness of drugs with anticonvulsant properties for interventions in persons with bipolar disorder and to place these findings in the context of clinicians' practices and their implications for future research to more effectively manage bipolar disorders.

Methods

Major electronic databases were searched up to February 2009 for clinical trial data, both original studies and reviews, on drugs with anticonvulsant properties studied for bipolar disorders.

Results

Valproate, principally as divalproex, has strong evidence for effectiveness in mania, moderately strong evidence for benefits in prophylaxis of recovered states, and recent proof-of-concept evidence for benefits in bipolar depression. Lamotrigine has strong evidence for evidence for effectiveness in maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder, principally for benefits in depressive states. Lamotrigine has been established as ineffective in mania and has lacked efficacy in acute bipolar depression in most randomized trials. Carbamazepine has strong evidence for effectiveness in mania, but lacks adequate studies in other aspects of bipolar disorder treatment. Its adverse effect profile and pharmacokinetic interference with a wide range of drugs, including many employed in bipolar disorder, warrants limitation of use to patients who have responded inadequately to other regimens.

Conclusions

Three drugs, valproate, lamotrigine, and carbamazepine, have strong evidence-based support for use in clinical states of bipolar disorder. Other anticonvulsant drugs investigated in bipolar disorder either have evidence of lack of benefits in bipolar disorder or have been inadequately studied to determine possible effectiveness.

### All studies are not created equal: a systematic narrative review of bipolar depression clinical trial inclusion / exclusion rules and baseline severity scores [^112MhJZZ]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Several bipolar depression treatment guidelines have been designed to assist clinicians with medication selection. When ranking medications, none explicitly considered the inclusion/exclusion criteria or baseline severity scores of the reviewed clinical trials. This article aimed to determine if sufficient differences exist in these variables to justify their consideration when designing treatment guidelines.

Methods

Using Ovid and PubMed databases in May and September 2022, all published, short-term cross-over or parallel-group design studies comparing second generation antipsychotics (SGAs), mood stabilizers, or antidepressants versus placebo in bipolar depressed patients were identified. Included studies must have enrolled adult bipolar I/II depressed patients, randomized patients into two or more treatment groups, utilized a double-blind, prospective design written in English, and had primary outcome results that were statistically significant in favor of the investigational treatment.

Results

Thirty studies met eligibility criteria, comprising a total of 8791 patients. Among those studies, there were seventeen antipsychotic trials, six lithium trials, one lamotrigine trial, three valproate trials, two carbamazepine trials, and two antidepressant trials. The analysis revealed substantial differences among the studies. Although this was seen among all the different drug classes, these differences are clearest when comparing the lithium trials to those of the SGAs.

Limitations

Limitations included the selection of severity scores from the treatment arm with the most severe score and the exclusive focus on mood stabilizers, antidepressants, and SGAs.

Conclusions

Severity of the enrolled patient sample and treatment-resistance should be considered in addition to other factors when ranking medications in bipolar depression treatment guidelines.

### Lamotrigine (Lamictal) [^117VFzNY]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The dosage of lamotrigine PO for treatment of bipolar disorder in adults (maintenance therapy, in patients taking carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, or primidone, but not valproate) is:

- Start at: 50 mg PO daily for 2 weeks, followed by 100 mg PO daily for another 2 weeks, and 200 mg PO daily and 300 mg PO daily for weeks 5 and 6, respectively
- Maintenance: 300–500 mg PO daily, in 2 divided doses

### Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) and International Society for Bipolar Disorders (ISBD) 2018 guidelines for the management of patients with bipolar disorder [^1136YV3R]. Bipolar Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Clinicians are advised to appropriately dose these medications for an adequate period of time before concluding lack of efficacy. Clinical trials have shown that there is no difference in efficacy between quetiapine 300mg and 600mg daily doses. Lower doses of quetiapine have not been studied in clinical trials for bipolar depression. Therefore, clinicians are advised to consider a target dose of 300 mg/day for quetiapine. For lithium, we suggest that serum lithium levels should be maintained between 0.8 and 1.2 meq/L, while for lamotrigine, the target should be a minimum of 200 mg/day.

### Treatment of bipolar depression: an update [^112iUf11]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2008). Low credibility.

This article attempts to summarize the current status of our knowledge and practice in the acute treatment and prophylaxis of bipolar depression. For prophylactic treatment, our knowledge about lithium firmly supports its usefulness against bipolar depression and its specific effectiveness for suicidal prevention. Valproic acid and carbamazepine could be effective, too, while lamotrigine which seems to be preferably effective against depression but not mania. The FDA has approved the olanzapine-fluoxetine combination and quetiapine monotherapy for the treatment of acute bipolar depression. The usefulness of antidepressants in bipolar depression is controversial both for acute and prophylactic treatment; guidelines suggest their cautious use and always in combination with an antimanic and mood stabilizer agent, because in some patients they may induce switching to mania or hypomania, mixed episodes and rapid cycling. Data on psychosocial intervention are restricted to the maintenance phase. Electroconvulsive therapy and transcranial magnetic stimulation are additional options for refractory patients. Bipolar depression seems to be a more difficult condition to treat than mania. Most patients need complex combination treatment although the published evidence on this type of treatment is limited.

### Methodological differences between pharmacological treatment guidelines for bipolar disorder: what to do for the clinicians? [^115TLopZ]. Comprehensive Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Numerous guidelines for bipolar disorder have been published. The aim of this article is to underline the main differences between consensus-based guidelines (CBG) and evidence-based guidelines (EBG) currently available for the management of bipolar disorder.

Methods

A literature search for guidelines published since 2006 was performed. A qualitative analysis was then conducted to compare the methodologies and the guidelines contents.

Results

Comparison between CBG and EBG found more similarities than differences. However, discordances were found in the first-line choice of treatment (monotherapy or combination, use of lamotrigine or lithium in bipolar depression), time to reassessment and duration of maintenance treatment, introduction as from the acute phase a regimen compatible with long-term use and pharmacotherapy during pregnancy.

Conclusions

The choice of policy, whatever the methodology used, is up to the authors and can, therefore, depend on their interpretation of the available scientific evidence. Combining both methodologies (CBG and EBG) enables us to meet the complete definition of evidence-based medicine.

### Relapse prevention in bipolar disorder: a critical review of current guidelines [^114n4XPE]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2006). Low credibility.

Bipolar disorder is an important and serious mental illness associated with significant morbidity and mortality. However, unfortunately, the evidence base regarding treatment is less than satisfactory. In such circumstances clinicians often resort to reputable sets of guidelines. A number of these currently exist; in the United Kingdom the most prominent being that produced by the British Association of Psychopharmacology (BAP). This paper reviews the methodology of this guideline and its recommendations regarding the long-term treatment of bipolar disorder and compares this with guidelines produced by the American Psychiatric Association (APA), the Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) and the Texas Implementation of Medication Algorithms (TIMA) for bipolar I disorder. It is concluded that the BAP guidelines continue to be a reasonable set of recommendations, though there are new data available since their publication. All the guidelines reviewed place lithium and valproate at the top of the list of options for long-term treatment. There is a trend to increasingly recognize atypical antipsychotics, particularly olanzapine, as an additional alternative and an increasing prominence of lamotrigine for prevention of depressive relapses. All other treatment options currently have an extremely limited evidence base and do not feature consistently in the published guidelines.

### Lamotrigine (Lamictal) [^113zoG7k]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The dosage of lamotrigine XR PO for adjunctive treatment for generalized tonic-clonic seizures in adults (primary, in patients taking valproate) is:

- Start at: 25 mg PO q48h for 2 weeks, followed by 25 mg PO daily for another 2 weeks and 50 mg PO daily, 100 mg PO daily, and 150 mg PO daily for weeks 5, 6, and 7, respectively
- Maintenance: 200–250 mg PO daily

### Efficacy of newer anticonvulsant medications in bipolar spectrum mood disorders [^116e6nkC]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Background

More treatment options for all phases of bipolar disorder are needed. While lithium, valproate, and carbamazepine remain the standard of care for treatment of bipolar disorder, many patients do not respond adequately to these treatments. Some new antiepileptic medications such as lamotrigine, gabapentin, topiramate, oxcarbazepine, tiagabine, and zonisamide are beginning to be used to treat bipolar disorder.

Data Sources

Evidence for effectiveness of these novel antiepileptic drugs in treating acute mania and depression as well as in preventing the recurrence of mania and depression is reviewed. A MEDLINE search (1966–2001) was performed for clinical trials that were published in English using the keywords lamotrigine, gabapentin, topiramate, oxcarbazepine, tiagabine, and zonisamide, plus the terms bipolar disorder and mania. Evidence for effectiveness of monotherapy is presented first when it is available. Data from augmentation treatment studies and open case series in which standard ratings of symptoms were employed are presented when these are the only available data.

Data Synthesis

Twenty-eight reports of the efficacy of novel antiepileptic medications in bipolar disorder are reviewed. Evidence is strongest for lamotrigine monotherapy in patients with bipolar depression, in some patients with rapid-cycling bipolar disorder, and as prophylaxis. Evidence for the efficacy of topiramate in acute and refractory mania is promising but comes predominantly from open trials. Although some very small studies have found that oxcarbazepine and zonisamide may have some effectiveness for treating mania, these data are very preliminary. Results are mixed from the 2 small open trials of tiagabine. Although gabapentin is widely used in bipolar disorder, controlled data do not support the use of gabapentin as an antimanic medication or mood stabilizer.

Conclusion

More controlled trials are needed to assess the effectiveness of novel antiepileptic medications in bipolar disorder.

### Treatment of bipolar depression: current status, continued challenges, and the STEP-BD approach [^115TzQLv]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Even though at least 10% (if not 20%) of those who experience a first lifetime episode of depression will subsequently develop bipolar disorder, the alliance of academic and industry research agendas that leads to developing and testing new antidepressants has failed to produce a sufficient knowledge base. It is therefore impossible to apply a truly empirical approach to guide the treatment of people with bipolar depression. Consequently, there are holes in contemporary evidenced-based practice guidelines large enough to drive a truck through; furthermore, there are some recommendations that have no factual basis other than expert opinion. However, with new research emerging on lamotrigine and olanzapine, in addition to the pending results of larger studies supported by the National Institute of Mental Health and the Stanley Foundation, there is evidence that some progress is being made.

### The efficacy of lamotrigine in bipolar disorder: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1116yoRV]. Bipolar Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

To provide up-to-date clinical guidance on the efficacy of lamotrigine in bipolar disorder (BD).

Methods

Eligible studies were identified during a systematic literature search according to PRISMA-guidelines. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cohort studies that quantitatively assessed lamotrigine's efficacy in BD. We divided the included studies into three groups: 1. acute treatment of depression, 2. acute treatment of mania and hypomania, and 3. maintenance treatment. Analyses were stratified by control group (placebo vs active comparator) and treatment strategy (monotherapy vs add-on treatment).

Results

We included 20 RCTs (n = 1166 lamotrigine users) and 20 cohort studies (n = 11,141 lamotrigine users). Twenty-four of these studies were included in meta-analyses. During depressive episodes, greater decreases in depressive symptomatology were associated with initiation of lamotrigine as add-on treatment than with placebo (SMD -0.30 [95% CI = -0.51, -0.10], df = 3, p = 0.004). Decreases in depressive symptomatology did not differ significantly between lamotrigine and the active comparator (SMD -0.28 [95% CI = -1.06, 0.50], df = 3, p = 0.488). As a maintenance treatment, lamotrigine was associated with a significantly lower relapse/recurrence rate than placebo (risk ratio (RR) 0.84 [95% CI = 0.71, 0.99], df = 2, p = 0.037). Relapse/recurrence rates did not differ significantly between lamotrigine and lithium (RR 1.06 [95% CI = 0.89, 1.25], df = 2, p = 0.513). A qualitative assessment of high-quality register-based studies found that lamotrigine was associated with lower hospital admission rates than other commonly used treatment regimes.

Conclusions

There is substantial evidence for the efficacy of lamotrigine in BD, specifically as add-on treatment during acute depressive episodes and as maintenance treatment for preventing relapse and recurrence.

### Anticonvulsant efficacy of valproate-like carboxylic acids: a potential target for anti-bipolar therapy [^11589EBe]. Bipolar Disorders (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Bipolar disorder (BPD) is a severe and chronic illness, with a lifetime prevalence of approximately 1.5%. Despite the availability of some mood stabilizing drugs including lithium, valproate (valproic acid), lamotrigine and carbamazepine, BPD is characterized by high rates of recurrence, as treatment with these and other drugs is ineffective for and not well-tolerated by a significant percentage of patients. Most drugs currently used for the maintenance treatment of BPD are anticonvulsants (e.g., valproate, carbamazepine and lamotrigine).

Objectives

The aim of this paper is to review the studies characterizing the anticonvulsant efficacy of valproate-like carboxylic acids and related compounds, some of which may have potential for the treatment of manic-depressive illness.

Results

The data reviewed herein demonstrate clearly that some dietary fatty acids and other valproate-like carboxylic acids exhibit potent anticonvulsant activity, and may thus be candidates for mood stabilizing treatment options for BPD.

### Long-term outcome of bipolar depressed patients receiving lamotrigine as add-on to lithium with the possibility of the addition of paroxetine in nonresponders: a randomized, placebo-controlled trial with a novel design [^1166vWGY]. Bipolar Disorders (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

In two previous manuscripts, we described the efficacy of lamotrigine versus placebo as add-on to lithium (followed by the addition of paroxetine in nonresponders) in the short-term treatment of bipolar depression. In this paper we describe the long-term (68 weeks) outcome of that study.

Methods

A total of 124 bipolar depressed patients receiving lithium were randomized to addition of lamotrigine or placebo. After eight weeks, paroxetine was added to nonresponders for another eight weeks. Responders continued medication and were followed for up to 68 weeks or until a relapse or recurrence of a depressive or manic episode.

Results

After eight weeks, the addition of lamotrigine to lithium was significantly more efficacious than addition of placebo, while after addition of paroxetine in nonresponders both groups further improved with no significant difference between groups at week 16. During follow-up the efficacy of lamotrigine was maintained: time to relapse or recurrence was longer for the lamotrigine group [median time 10.0 months (confidence interval: 1.1–18.8)] versus the placebo group [3.5 months (confidence interval: 0.7–7.0)].

Conclusion

In patients with bipolar depression, despite continued use of lithium, addition of lamotrigine revealed a continued benefit compared to placebo throughout the entire study.

### Long-term treatment of bipolar disorder with lamotrigine [^11645EME]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

Bipolar depression is as debilitating as mania in bipolar disorder, but the treatment of bipolar depression has historically received less attention. To date, there is no mood stabilizer (liberally defined as a medication that decreases episode severity, duration, or frequency in one phase of bipolar illness without producing a negative effect in other phases) that demonstrates similar efficacy in both the depressive and the manic phases of bipolar disorder. However, bipolar depression — which is prevalent, sometimes chronic, and associated with a low quality of life and a high risk of suicide — must be addressed as energetically as mania. Recent research into the long-term treatment of bipolar disorder has raised several questions about the generalizability of early lithium studies, as a result of these studies' designs. Researchers conducting more recent studies of mood stabilizers in the long-term treatment of bipolar disorder have attempted to clarify their results by, for example, performing survival analyses of the data. Until pharmacotherapy has been found that is equally efficacious in the treatment of both manic and depressive episodes in bipolar disorder, the use of combination therapy to manage bipolar disorder is advised. Lithium and divalproex sodium remain the first-line treatments for mania. Lamotrigine has been found to have acute efficacy in treating episodes of bipolar depression without increasing cycling or provoking a switch into mania, as well as a long-term role in delaying relapse and recurrence of depressive episodes.

### Antidepressants in bipolar disorder: the case for caution [^111VS1on]. Bipolar Disorders (2003). Low credibility.

The 2002 American Psychiatric Association (APA) guidelines for the treatment of bipolar disorder recommended more conservative use of antidepressants. This change in comparison with previous APA guidelines has been criticized, especially from some groups in Europe. The Munich group in particular has published a critique of assumptions underlying the conservative recommendations of the recent APA treatment guidelines. In this paper, we re-examine the argument put forward by the Munich group, and we demonstrate that indeed, conceptually and empirically, there is a strong rationale for a cautious approach to antidepressant use in bipolar disorder, consistent with, and perhaps even more strongly than, the APA guidelines. This rationale is based on support for the following four propositions: (i) The risk of antidepressant induced mood-cycling is high, (ii) Antidepressants have not been shown to definitively prevent completed suicides and reduce mortality, whereas lithium has, (iii) Antidepressants have not been shown to be more effective than mood stabilizers in acute bipolar depression and have been shown to be less effective than mood stabilizers in preventing depressive relapse in bipolar disorder and (iv) Mood stabilizers, especially lithium and lamotrigine, have been shown to be effective in acute and prophylactic treatment of bipolar depressive episodes. We therefore draw three conclusions from this interpretation of the evidence: (i) There are significant risks of mania and long-term worsening of bipolar illness with antidepressants, (ii) Antidepressants should generally be reserved for severe cases of acute bipolar depression and not routinely used in mild to moderate cases and (iii) Antidepressants should be discontinued after recovery from the depressive episode, and maintained only in those who repeatedly relapse after antidepressant discontinuation (a minority we judge to represent only about 15–20% of bipolar depressed patients).

### Bipolar disorders and the effectiveness of novel anticonvulsants [^113rZrt3]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

The discovery that valproic acid is helpful in the management of patients with rapid-cycling bipolar disorder led to an explosion of research culminating in the third-generation anticonvulsants. Refractory depressive phases are frequent in bipolar disorders. No studies to date have shown that gabapentin is effective in bipolar mania or hypomania. Lamotrigine may have a role in treating bipolar depressive episodes, but it is not a particularly effective antimanic agent. Topiramate has shown encouraging results in both depressed and manic bipolar patients, and it may also promote weight loss. The new anticonvulsants are promising agents for the treatment of bipolar disorders, but they are heterogeneous with regard to their efficacy, target symptoms, and adverse event profiles.

### Lamotrigine in the acute treatment of bipolar depression: results of five double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials [^1166YUEm]. Bipolar Disorders (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

The efficacy of lamotrigine as maintenance treatment for bipolar disorder (BD), particularly for delaying depressive episodes, is well established, but its efficacy in the acute treatment of bipolar depression is less clear. This paper reports the results of five randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of lamotrigine monotherapy for the acute treatment of bipolar depression.

Methods

Adult subjects with bipolar I or II disorder experiencing a depressive episode were randomized to placebo or lamotrigine monotherapy (after titration, at a fixed dose of 50 mg or 200 mg daily in Study 1; a flexible dose of 100–400 mg daily in Study 2; or a fixed dose of 200 mg daily in Studies 3, 4 and 5) for 7–10 weeks.

Results

Lamotrigine did not differ significantly from placebo on primary efficacy endpoints [17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale in Studies 1 and 2; Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) in Studies 3, 4 and 5]. In Study 1, lamotrigine significantly separated from placebo on some secondary measures of efficacy, including the MADRS, the Clinical Global Impressions-Severity (CGI-S) and the CGI-Improvement (CGI-I), but seldom differed on secondary efficacy endpoints for the other studies.

Conclusions

Lamotrigine monotherapy did not demonstrate efficacy in the acute treatment of bipolar depression in four out of five placebo-controlled clinical studies. Lamotrigine was well tolerated in the acute treatment of bipolar depression.

### Newer anticonvulsants in the treatment of bipolar disorder [^114eouTS]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

The anticonvulsants valproate and carbamazepine have efficacy in treating acute mania, but their efficacy in treating acute bipolar depression and preventing mood episodes remains uncertain. Despite this, and given their utility and widespread use, both are widely accepted as standard treatments for bipolar disorder. All the newer anticonvulsants that have become available during the last decade have been or are being assessed to determine their efficacy in the treatment of various phases of bipolar disorder. Among the newer anticonvulsants, some appear to have efficacy in treating core bipolar symptoms, while others have efficacy in treating psychiatric comorbidity such as substance abuse or an anxiety disorder. Lamotrigine is the most widely studied and is effective in treating and preventing bipolar depression, and it is the only anticonvulsant approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as a maintenance treatment for bipolar disorder. Other newer anticonvulsants, levetiracetam, oxcarbazepine, phenytoin, and zonisamide offer promise, but further studies are required before they can be recommended for routine use to treat bipolar disorder. Gabapentin and topiramate do not appear to have efficacy in treating acute mania, but their utility in bipolar depression and prevention of mood episodes has not been studied in double-blind trials. Pregabalin has utility in treating generalized anxiety disorder, but it has not been studied in bipolar disorder. Given the success of lamotrigine in treating bipolar disorder, further double-blind controlled trials of the newer anticonvulsants in treating bipolar disorder are warranted. This article summarizes current evidence from trials of anticonvulsants in bipolar disorder and makes recommendations for their clinical use.

### Comparative evaluation of quetiapine plus lamotrigine combination versus quetiapine monotherapy (and folic acid versus placebo) in bipolar depression (CEQUEL): a 2 × 2 factorial randomised trial [^116GDwQv]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2016). Medium credibility.

Background

Depressive symptoms are a major cause of disability in bipolar disorder and there are few safe and effective treatments. The combination of lamotrigine plus quetiapine potentially offers improved outcomes for people with bipolar depression. We aimed to determine if combination therapy with quetiapine plus lamotrigine leads to greater improvement in depressive symptoms over 12 weeks than quetiapine monotherapy plus lamotrigine placebo.

Methods

In this double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, parallel group, 2×2 factorial trial (CEQUEL), patients with DSM-IV bipolar disorder I or II, who were aged 16 years or older, and required new treatment for a depressive episode, were enrolled from 27 sites in the UK. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) by an adaptive minimisation algorithm to lamotrigine or placebo and to folic acid or placebo. Participants and investigators were masked to the treatment groups. The primary outcome was improvement in depressive symptoms at 12 weeks with the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-self report version 16 (QIDS-SR16). Analysis was by modified intention-to-treat. This trial is registered with EUdraCT, number 2007–004513–33.

Findings

Between Oct 21, 2008, and April 27, 2012, 202 participants were randomly assigned; 101 to lamotrigine and 101 to placebo. The mean difference in QIDS-SR16 total score between the group receiving lamotrigine versus the placebo group at 12 weeks was -1·73 ([95% CI -3·57 to 0·11]; p = 0·066) and at 52 weeks was -2·69 ([-4·89 to -0·49]; p = 0·017). Folic acid was not superior to placebo. There was a significant interaction (p = 0·028), with folic acid reducing the effectiveness of lamotrigine at 12 weeks. The mean difference on QIDS-SR16 was -4·14 ([95% CI -6·90 to -1·37]; p = 0·004) for patients receiving lamotrigine without folic acid compared with 0·12 ([-2·58 to 2·82]; p = 0·931) for those receiving lamotrigine and folic acid.

Interpretation

Addition of lamotrigine to quetiapine treatment improved outcomes. Folic acid seems to nullify the effect of lamotrigine. CEQUEL should encourage clinicians and patients to consider lamotrigine for bipolar depression, but also to be aware that concurrent folic acid might reduce its effectiveness.

### Lithium and lamotrigine for the treatment of bipolar II disorder-a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials [^114UY5Ui]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to synthesize the evidence from randomized trials of lithium, lamotrigine, and placebo for the treatment of bipolar II disorder (BDII) in terms of bipolar II depression, hypomania, and maintenance treatment.

Methods

A literature search was performed 20th November 2024 across PubMed, Embase and PsycINFO, and grey literature for studies of lithium, lamotrigine, and placebo in adults with BDII, across illness phases. Primary outcomes were efficacy and tolerability. We conducted random-effects pair-wise meta-analysis to provide a summary measure of effect, assessed the risk of bias, and assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE framework.

Results

Our search yielded 2326 records, including 10 randomized trials comprising 645 patients with BDII. The evidence was very uncertain regarding lithium's effect on the risk of new affective episodes, regardless of polarity, compared with placebo (RR 0.86, 95% CI [0.66, 1.11], I² = 0%, four studies, very low certainty evidence). A quantitative synthesis could not be conducted to compare lamotrigine and placebo. The evidence was very uncertain regarding the effect of lithium on depression severity compared with lamotrigine (mean HAMD17 difference: 1.27, 95% CI [-3.84, 6.38], I² = 0%, two studies, very low certainty evidence). The overall risk of bias was of 'some concern' for 84% of outcomes assessed. For all outcomes, the certainty of the evidence was graded 'very low'.

Conclusion

The evidence for lithium and lamotrigine in treating BDII is scarce, and the certainty of the evidence is very low. Large, well-conducted RCTs of patients with BDII are needed.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for management of bipolar disorder [^117QdScN]. VA/DoD (2023). High credibility.

VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline — Recommendation 21 on lamotrigine for bipolar disorder states: "We suggest against lamotrigine as monotherapy for the prevention of recurrence of mania" and is rated "(Weak against | Reviewed, New-added)". The guideline notes "Evidence does not support the use of lamotrigine to prevent recurrence of mania", although "the evidence does support the use of lamotrigine to prevent bipolar depressive episodes". Adverse effects are described as generally mild with "no difference from placebo in discontinuation because of side effects", but "rare, but serious" events including "potentially fatal SJS/TEN" are reported; "milder rashes occur in 10% of individuals" and other symptoms "blurred vision, ataxia, headaches, and nausea might occur", leading the Work Group to conclude "the harms exceed the benefits for this indication". The guideline highlights that "If an individual is on valproate, the drug might raise lamotrigine levels and can increase the risk of rashes, including dangerous ones", and that lamotrigine "requires a slow titration… that usually takes at least six weeks", with "Frequent follow-up with the prescribing provider" needed; the recommendation is "categorized as Reviewed, New-added".

### A 52-week, open-label continuation study of lamotrigine in the treatment of bipolar depression [^117U3WKJ]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Lamotrigine has demonstrated efficacy for the acute treatment of depression in bipolar I patients in a placebo-controlled, monotherapy study. We describe the results of a 52-week, open-label continuation of that trial.

Method

Patients meeting DSM-IV criteria for bipolar I disorder with a current major depressive episode who completed a 7-week, double-blind study of bipolar depression were offered 1 year of open-label lamotrigine therapy (flexible doses of 100–500 mg/day) in a continuation study. To maintain the acute study blind, the first 3 weeks of the continuation study remained blinded while patients previously randomly assigned to placebo were titrated to a lamotrigine dose of 50 mg/day. Patients who had been randomly assigned to lamotrigine continued at their fixed doses. Beginning at week 4, all patients received open-label lamotrigine for up to 49 additional weeks. Concomitant psychotropic medications were permitted during the open-label phase. Effectiveness (Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale [MADRS], Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement scale) and safety assessments were administered at weeks 4, 12, 24, 36, and 52. The study was conducted from June 1996 to December 1998.

Results

Of 135 patients completing the acute study, 124 (92%) entered the continuation study: 77 had received lamotrigine and 47 had received placebo in the acute study. The mean duration of lamotrigine exposure was 10.4 months, with a mean modal dose of 187 mg/day. Sixty-nine patients (56%) completed 1 year of treatment. Significant and sustained improvement from baseline was seen in mean observed MADRS scores (p < .05). The proportion of patients achieving remission (MADRS score ≤ 11) by week 4 of the study was 81.4%, and episodes of mania/hypomania occurred less frequently than in the preceding year. Headache was the most common drug-related adverse event.

Conclusion

During 1 year of open-label therapy with lamotrigine as adjunctive therapy or monotherapy, bipolar I patients experienced sustained improvement in depressive symptoms without evidence of mood destabilization.

### The efficacy of pharmacological interventions in the treatment of major depressive disorder and bipolar depression with mixed features: a systematic review [^115YEsUV]. Bipolar Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

4 Discussion

Herein, we identified seven studies that met the inclusion criteria for this systematic review. Of the seven reports, most used post hoc analysis to determine the efficacy and safety of a pharmacological treatment as the prespecified and primary efficacy outcome. No single agent was found to be efficacious as part of two large adequately powered double‐blind placebo‐controlled trials wherein evaluating outcomes in persons enrolled primarily on the basis of mixed features as part of an MDE (often employed as the benchmark of demonstrated efficacy). Second‐generation antipsychotics were the class of drugs most studied, notably lurasidone, lumateperone, cariprazine, olanzapine, and quetiapine. Available evidence also indicates that each of the aforementioned interventions did not result in a significantly higher rate of treatment‐emergent affective switching. Moreover, lithium, valproate, and lamotrigine, three agents commonly prescribed for persons living with bipolar disorder, have been insufficiently evaluated in adults with depressive episodes with mixed features. The inadequacy of the evidence base for these three agents does not negate the possibility that they may be meaningfully effective in depressive episodes with mixed features.

Mixed features have historical, conceptual, nosologic, and therapeutic implications. Mixed features, states, and episodes have been variably defined and described for over a century. Supplanting mixed episodes with mixed features in the DSM‐5 in 2013 was a pivot towards a more dimensional and unifying conceptualization of mixed features across mood disorders. Debate continues about the essential aspects of mixed features and whether the exclusion of non‐overlapping symptoms may potentially reduce sensitivity in the interest of specificity. Debate also continues regarding the central features of mixed and whether mixed features identify a unique sub‐population and/or are a transitory phenomenon. Separate lines of observation also suggest that mixed features may be increasingly replacing euphoric presentations perhaps due to prescription behavior (e.g. antidepressant utilization), social and economic determinants, and/or increased rates of comorbidity (e.g. obesity). Against this background, there is an urgent need to identify safe and effective therapeutic avenues for MDEs with mixed features, which are estimated to affect 25%–40% of all adults presenting mood disorders clinically.

### Mood stabilizers and / or antipsychotics for bipolar disorder in the maintenance phase: a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^1162GT9K]. Molecular Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

We searched Embase, PubMed, and CENTRAL from inception until 22 May 2020 to investigate which antipsychotics and/or mood stabilizers are better for patients with bipolar disorder in the maintenance phase. We performed two categorical network meta-analyses. The first included monotherapy studies and studies in which the two drugs used were specified (i.e., aripiprazole, aripiprazole once monthly, aripiprazole+lamotrigine, aripiprazole+valproate, asenapine, carbamazepine, lamotrigine, lamotrigine+valproate, lithium, lithium+oxcarbazepine, lithium+valproate, olanzapine, paliperidone, quetiapine, risperidone long-acting injection, valproate, and placebo). The second included studies on second-generation antipsychotic combination therapies (SGAs) (i.e., aripiprazole, lurasidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, and ziprasidone) with lithium or valproate (LIT/VAL) compared with placebo with LIT/VAL. Outcomes were recurrence/relapse rate of any mood episode (RR-any, primary), depressive episode (RR-dep) and manic/hypomanic/mixed episode (RR-mania), discontinuation, mortality, and individual adverse events. Risk ratios and 95% credible interval were calculated. Forty-one randomized controlled trials were identified (n = 9821; mean study duration, 70.5 ± 36.6 weeks; percent female, 54.1%; mean age, 40.7 years). All active treatments other than carbamazepine, lamotrigine+valproate (no data) and paliperidone outperformed the placebo for RR-any. Aripiprazole+valproate, lamotrigine, lamotrigine+valproate, lithium, olanzapine, and quetiapine outperformed placebo for RR-dep. All active treatments, other than aripiprazole+valproate, carbamazepine, lamotrigine, and lamotrigine+valproate, outperformed placebo for RR-mania. Asenapine, lithium, olanzapine, quetiapine, and valproate outperformed placebo for all-cause discontinuation. All SGAs+LIT/VALs other than olanzapine+LIT/VAL outperformed placebo+LIT/VAL for RR-any. Lurasidone+LIT/VAL and quetiapine+LIT/VAL outperformed placebo+LIT/VAL for RR-dep. Aripiprazole+LIT/VAL and quetiapine+LIT/VAL outperformed placebo+LIT/VAL for RR-mania. Lurasidone+LIT/VAL and quetiapine+LIT/VAL outperformed placebo+LIT/VAL for all-cause discontinuation. Treatment efficacy, tolerability, and safety profiles differed among treatments.

### Lamotrigine chewable dispersible (lamotrigine) [^111rUvwD]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

2.4. Bipolar Disorder

The goal of maintenance treatment with lamotrigine is to delay the time to occurrence of mood episodes (depression, mania, hypomania, mixed episodes) in patients treated for acute mood episodes with standard therapy [see Indications and Usage (1)].

Patients taking lamotrigine for more than 16 weeks should be periodically reassessed to determine the need for maintenance treatment.

Adults

The target dose of lamotrigine is 200 mg/day (100 mg/day in patients taking valproate, which decreases the apparent clearance of lamotrigine, and 400 mg/day in patients not taking valproate and taking either carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, or other drugs such as rifampin and the protease inhibitors lopinavir/ritonavir that increase the apparent clearance of lamotrigine). In the clinical trials, doses up to 400 mg/day as monotherapy were evaluated; however, no additional benefit was seen at 400 mg/day compared with 200 mg/day [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. Accordingly, doses above 200 mg/day are not recommended.

Treatment with lamotrigine is introduced, based on concurrent medications, according to the regimen outlined in Table 5. If other psychotropic medications are withdrawn following stabilization, the dose of lamotrigine should be adjusted. In patients discontinuing valproate, the dose of lamotrigine should be doubled over a 2-week period in equal weekly increments (see Table 6). In patients discontinuing carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, or other drugs such as rifampin and the protease inhibitors lopinavir/ritonavir and atazanavir/ritonavir that induce lamotrigine glucuronidation, the dose of lamotrigine should remain constant for the first week and then should be decreased by half over a 2-week period in equal weekly decrements (see Table 6). The dose of lamotrigine may then be further adjusted to the target dose (200 mg) as clinically indicated.

Quetiapine (level 1), 241, 242, 243 lithium (level 2), 244, 245, 246 lamotrigine (level 2) 242, 247, 248 and lurasidone (level 2) 249 are all recommended as first‐line treatment options with evidence for efficacy as monotherapy.

Lurasidone (level 1) 249, 250 and lamotrigine (level 2) 251, 252 are also recommended as first‐line adjunctive treatments (Figure 2). Although quetiapine and lithium have not been assessed for efficacy as adjunctive treatments for acute bipolar depression, clinicians may choose to apply this combination in patients who experience depression when optimized on one of either of these medications.

Figure 2
Lithium and lamotrigine as first‐line agents for bipolar I depression: Summary of evidence > [Colour figure can be viewed at]

Recommendations as to which first‐line treatment should be considered first are outlined in our hierarchy. We recommend that the agents listed first in the hierarchy be tried first, in the order listed, unless there are patient‐specific reasons for choosing an agent lower down in the order, such as previous history of response/ non‐response or clinical features (see Clinical features which help direct treatment choices). For instance, if a patient presents with an acute bipolar depressive episode and is not taking any treatment and has not been treated for this episode, that patient should be commenced on quetiapine monotherapy if there is no previous history of non‐response or tolerability concerns with quetiapine. However, if a patient had been taking lithium and either had a breakthrough acute bipolar depressive episode or did not respond to monotherapy with lithium, then lurasidone or lamotrigine or quetiapine add‐on or switch to quetiapine monotherapy or lurasidone monotherapy might be more appropriate in that order, given that lurasidone and lamotrigine adjunctive therapies have demonstrated efficacy in lithium non‐responders. Similarly, in non‐responders to lithium monotherapy, adjunctive lamotrigine could be another option.

### Rationale for using lithium in combination with other mood stabilizers in the management of bipolar disorder [^112K6B1c]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Bipolar disorder is a complex illness, and no single agent has been proven in randomized, placebo-controlled trials to effectively prevent and/or control all aspects of the illness-acute mania, rapid cycling, and breakthrough depression. However, for the most important issue, prophylaxis of episodes, lithium has more evidence of efficacy than any other agent. Like lithium, typical antipsychotics, carbamazepine, divalproex, and the atypical antipsychotic olanzapine are effective in the treatment of mania. Carbamazepine, divalproex, and olanzapine seem effective in preventing manic episodes but, like lithium, are less effective in preventing depression. Few trials have been conducted in the more difficult-to-treat characteristics of bipolar disorder, specifically, rapid cycling and break-through depression. For patients with rapid cycling, carbamazepine or divalproex therapy may improve symptoms, but only lamotrigine has been shown to reduce cycling, mostly in the bipolar II group, in a randomized, placebo-controlled study. For the treatment of depressive episodes, lithium and olanzapine have shown modest efficacy in controlled trials, and among the mood stabilizers, lamotrigine has the most robust effect. Because manic symptoms may respond best to one agent and depressive symptoms to another, combination therapy may be the optimal treatment for many patients with bipolar disorder. For example, lithium augmentation may improve overall response rates to treatment with carbamazepine or divalproex, and the lithium-lamotrigine combination should provide effective prevention of both mania and depression. Also, each mood stabilizer may be given at lower doses when given in combination, resulting in a reduced side effect burden and improved compliance.

### Lamotrigine in the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder [^113MfWrV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Bipolar disorder is a chronic mental disorder with repetitive mania/hypomania as well as depressive episodes, which eventually results in marked impairment in overall functioning and health-related quality of life. A worldwide prevalence rate of 2.4% has been reported. The risk of suicide is higher in people with bipolar disorder than those with other mental disorders. Therefore, effective management of bipolar disorder in the maintenance period is warranted to minimize the risk of relapse or recurrence. Although lithium has been the standard treatment of bipolar disorder for many years, it is associated with adverse effects and teratogenicity. Lamotrigine is approved to be expected for prevention of recurrence for the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder. In addition, lamotrigine is as effective as lithium. Therefore, we performed a systematic review to confirm the efficacy and safety of lamotrigine in the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and tolerability of lamotrigine in the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder.

Search Methods

We searched Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Group's Specialized Register (CCMDCTR) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) from inception to 21 May 2021. We also searched international trial registries and contacted experts in the field.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials enrolling adults with bipolar disorder who were treated with lamotrigine, placebo or lithium.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviews authors independently checked the eligibility of studies and extracted data using a standardized form. Data extracted included study characteristics, participant characteristics, intervention details, settings, and outcome measures in the term of efficacy and tolerability. Study information were then entered into RevMan web.

Main Results

We included 11 studies with a total of 2314 participants in this review; 1146 were randomized to lamotrigine, 869 were randomized to placebo and, 299 to lithium. We rated all studies as having an unclear risk of bias in at least one domain of Cochrane's tool for assessing risk of bias, with the most commonly observed weakness being selection bias (random sequence generation and allocation concealment). We judged five studies to be at a high risk of detection bias (blinding of outcome assessment). These potential biases pose as major threat to the validity of the included studies in this review. Outcomes of efficacy showed a possible advantage of lamotrigine over placebo. The estimated risk ratio (RR) for recurrence of manic symptom at one year as measured by the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) was 0.67, (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.51 to 0.87; 3 studies, 663 participants; low-certainty evidence) in favor of lamotrigine. The RR of clinical worsening with the need for additional psychotropic treatment (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.98; 4 studies, 756 participants) based on moderate-certainty evidence. The possible benefits of lamotrigine were also seen for the outcome of treatment withdrawal due to any reason at 6–12 months after treatment (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.99; 4 studies, 700 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Regarding tolerability, our analyses showed that the incidence rates of adverse effects were similar between the lamotrigine group and the placebo group (short-term effect: RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.42; 5 studies, 1138 participants; very low-certainty evidence; long-term effect: RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.23; 4 studies, 756 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). In the comparison between lamotrigine and lithium, efficacy was similar between groups except for recurrence of mania episode at one year. Recurrence of manic symptoms was higher in the lamotrigine group than that of the lithium group (RR 2.13, 95% CI 1.32 to 3.44; 3 studies, 602 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Analysis of adverse effects at 6–12 months showed that a lower proportion of participants experienced at least one adverse effect when treated with lamotrigine compared to lithium (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.96; 4 studies, 691 participants; moderate-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Low- to moderate-certainty evidence collectively suggests that lamotrigine may be superior to placebo as a treatment modality for bipolar disorder. In comparison to lithium, people with bipolar disorder seem to tolerate lamotrigine better in the long run; however, the demonstrated efficacy in the maintenance of bipolar disorder was similar between the two groups.

### Valproic acid, valproate and divalproex in the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder [^111zMXAf]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Bipolar disorder is a recurrent illness that is amongst the top 30 causes of disability worldwide and is associated with significant healthcare costs. In the past, emphasis was placed solely on the treatment of acute episodes of bipolar disorder; recently, the importance of episode prevention and of minimisation of iatrogenicity has been recognised. For many years, lithium was the only mood stabiliser in common use, and it remains an agent of first choice in the preventative treatment of bipolar disorder. However, an estimated 20% to 40% of patients may not respond adequately to lithium. Valproate is an anticonvulsant drug that has been shown to be effective in acute mania and is frequently used in maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder. When the acceptability of long-term treatment is considered, together with efficacy, the adverse event profile of a medication is also important. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2001 and last updated in 2009.

Objectives

1. To determine the efficacy of valproate continuation and maintenance treatment:a) in preventing or attenuating manic, depressive and mixed episodes of bipolar disorder; b) in preventing or attenuating episodes of bipolar disorder in patients with rapid cycling disorder; and; c) in improving patients' general health and social functioning, as measured by global clinical impression, employment and marital stability.2. To review the acceptability to patients of long-term valproate treatment, as measured by numbers of dropouts and reasons for dropping out, by compliance and by reference to patients' expressed views regarding treatment.3. To investigate the adverse effects of valproate treatment (including general prevalence of side effects) and overall mortality rates.

Search Methods

Search of the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials and the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group Register (CCDANCTR) (to January 2013), which includes relevant randomised controlled trials from the following bibliographic databases: The Cochrane Library (all years), EMBASE, (1974 to date), MEDLINE (1950 to date) and PsycINFO (1967 to date). No language restrictions were applied. Reference lists of relevant papers and previous systematic reviews were handsearched. Pharmaceutical companies marketing valproate and experts in this field were contacted for supplemental data.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials allocating participants with bipolar disorder to long-term treatment with valproate or any other mood stabiliser, or antipsychotic drugs, or placebo. Maintenance treatment was defined as treatment instituted specifically or mainly to prevent further episodes of illness.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three review authors independently extracted data. A double-entry procedure was employed by two review authors. Information extracted included study characteristics, participant characteristics, intervention details and outcome measures in terms of efficacy, acceptability and tolerability. For dichotomous data, risk ratios were calculated with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For statistically significant results, we calculated the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) and the number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH). For continuous data, mean differences (MDs) or standardised mean differences (SMDs) were calculated along with 95% CIs. MDs were used when the same scale was used to measure an outcome; SMDs were employed when different scales were used to measure the same outcome. The primary analysis used a fixed-effect model. Binary outcomes were calculated on a strict intention-to-treat (ITT) basis; dropouts were included in this analysis. When data were missing and the method of "last observation carried forward" (LOCF) had been used to do an ITT analysis, then the LOCF data were used.

Main Results

Six randomised controlled trials (overall 876 participants) lasting 6 to 24 months were included. Two studies (overall 312 participants) compared valproate with placebo, four studies (overall 618 participants) valproate with lithium, one study (overall 23 participants) valproate with olanzapine and one study (overall 220 participants) valproate with the combination of valproate plus lithium. In terms of study quality, most studies reported the methods used to generate random sequence; however, only one study reported enough details on allocation concealment. Four of six included studies described their design as "double blind", but only two trials reported full details about blinding. Valproate was more effective than placebo in preventing study withdrawal due to any mood episode (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.93; NNTB 8), but no difference in efficacy was found between valproate and lithium (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.20). Valproate was associated with fewer participants dropping out of treatment for any cause when compared with placebo or lithium (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.95 and RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.77 to 0.98, respectively). However, combination therapy with lithium plus valproate was more likely to prevent relapse than was monotherapy with valproate (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.96). Significant differences in adverse event frequencies were found, and lithium was associated with more frequent diarrhoea, polyuria, increased thirst and enuresis, whereas valproate was associated with increased sedation and infection.

Authors' Conclusions

Limited evidence supports the efficacy of valproate in the long-term treatment of bipolar disorder. Clinicians and patients should consider acceptability and tolerability profile when choosing between lithium and valproate-their combination or other agents-as long-term treatment for bipolar disorder.

### The current understanding of lamotrigine as a mood stabilizer [^112cNUQT]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine whether lamotrigine has a unique role in the treatment of bipolar disorder, we evaluated the results of recent clinical trials and molecular and cell biological studies on lamotrigine.

Data Sources

Using keywords such as bipolar disorder, lamotrigine, clinical trial, outcomes studies, and mechanisms, we conducted a search for English-language articles on MEDLINE and Index Medicus and also on abstracts presented in recent research conferences.

Data Synthesis

Several studies have strongly suggested that lamotrigine is effective for the acute treatment of bipolar depression as well as for long-term maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder. Stevens-Johnson syndrome is a concern, but the incidence of this side effect may not be as high as previously believed, if dosing is slowly titrated. The action mechanisms underlying the mood-stabilizing effects of lamotrigine are unknown at present but recent studies have produced interesting leads. Lamotrigine modulates various ion channels, altering neuronal excitability. The use-dependent inhibition of neuronal firing by lamotrigine is potentially important because it could result in attenuating supranormal neuronal activities that are possibly associated with bipolar disorder. Lamotrigine inhibits the release of glutamate, similarly to lithium, and its possible association with mood-stabilizing or antidepressant effects needs to be further examined. Unlike lithium or valproic acid, however, lamotrigine does not down-regulate the expression of protein kinase C or MARCKS, suggesting that lamotrigine employs different intracellular mechanisms for long-term changes in neuro-biology from those of lithium or valproic acid.

Conclusion

The efficacy of lamotrigine for bipolar depression may provide us with new options in the treatment of bipolar disorder. Examining the effects of lamotrigine on various molecular mechanisms in correlation with its unique efficacy on bipolar depression may enhance our understanding of action mechanisms of the mood stabilizers.

### Lamotrigine (Lamictal) [^117V8ZJK]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.4 Bipolar Disorder

The goal of maintenance treatment with LAMICTAL is to delay the time to occurrence of mood episodes (depression, mania, hypomania, mixed episodes) in patients treated for acute mood episodes with standard therapy [see Indications and Usage (1.2)].

Patients taking LAMICTAL for more than 16 weeks should be periodically reassessed to determine the need for maintenance treatment.

Adults

The target dose of LAMICTAL is 200 mg/day (100 mg/day in patients taking valproate, which decreases the apparent clearance of lamotrigine, and 400 mg/day in patients not taking valproate and taking either carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, or other drugs such as rifampin and the protease inhibitor lopinavir/ritonavir that increase the apparent clearance of lamotrigine). In the clinical trials, doses up to 400 mg/day as monotherapy were evaluated; however, no additional benefit was seen at 400 mg/day compared with 200 mg/day [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. Accordingly, doses above 200 mg/day are not recommended.

Treatment with LAMICTAL is introduced, based on concurrent medications, according to the regimen outlined in Table 5. If other psychotropic medications are withdrawn following stabilization, the dose of LAMICTAL should be adjusted. In patients discontinuing valproate, the dose of LAMICTAL should be doubled over a 2-week period in equal weekly increments (see Table 6). In patients discontinuing carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, or other drugs such as rifampin and the protease inhibitors lopinavir/ritonavir and atazanavir/ritonavir that induce lamotrigine glucuronidation, the dose of LAMICTAL should remain constant for the first week and then should be decreased by half over a 2-week period in equal weekly decrements (see Table 6). The dose of LAMICTAL may then be further adjusted to the target dose (200 mg) as clinically indicated.

If other drugs are subsequently introduced, the dose of LAMICTAL may need to be adjusted. In particular, the introduction of valproate requires reduction in the dose of LAMICTAL [see Drug Interactions (7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

To avoid an increased risk of rash, the recommended initial dose and subsequent dose escalations of LAMICTAL should not be exceeded [see Boxed Warning].

Adults

The effectiveness of lamotrigine in the maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder was established in 2 multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in adult patients (aged 18 to 82 years) who met DSM-IV criteria for bipolar I disorder. Trial 1 enrolled patients with a current or recent (within 60 days) depressive episode as defined by DSM-IV and Trial 2 included patients with a current or recent (within 60 days) episode of mania or hypomania as defined by DSM-IV. Both trials included a cohort of patients (30% of 404 subjects in Trial 1 and 28% of 171 patients in Trial 2) with rapid cycling bipolar disorder (4 to 6 episodes per year).

In both trials, patients were titrated to a target dose of 200 mg of lamotrigine as add-on therapy or as monotherapy with gradual withdrawal of any psychotropic medications during an 8- to 16-week open-label period. Overall 81% of 1,305 patients participating in the open-label period were receiving 1 or more other psychotropic medications, including benzodiazepines, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), atypical antipsychotics (including olanzapine), valproate, or lithium, during titration of lamotrigine. Patients with a CGI-severity score of 3 or less maintained for at least 4 continuous weeks, including at least the final week on monotherapy with lamotrigine, were randomized to a placebo-controlled double-blind treatment period for up to 18 months. The primary endpoint was TIME (time to intervention for a mood episode or one that was emerging, time to discontinuation for either an adverse event that was judged to be related to bipolar disorder, or for lack of efficacy). The mood episode could be depression, mania, hypomania, or a mixed episode.

### Lamotrigine (Subvenite) [^114VWFDN]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In Trial 1, patients received double-blind monotherapy with lamotrigine 50 mg/day (n = 50), lamotrigine 200 mg/day (n = 124), lamotrigine 400 mg/day (n = 47), or placebo (n = 121). Lamotrigine (200- and 400-mg/day treatment groups combined) was superior to placebo in delaying the time to occurrence of a mood episode (Figure 1). Separate analyses of the 200- and 400-mg/day dose groups revealed no added benefit from the higher dose.

In Trial 2, patients received double-blind monotherapy with lamotrigine (100 to 400 mg/day, n = 59), or placebo (n = 70). Lamotrigine was superior to placebo in delaying time to occurrence of a mood episode (Figure 2). The mean dose of lamotrigine was about 211 mg/day.

Although these trials were not designed to separately evaluate time to the occurrence of depression or mania, a combined analysis for the 2 trials revealed a statistically significant benefit for lamotrigine over placebo in delaying the time to occurrence of both depression and mania, although the finding was more robust for depression.

### Mood stabilizers and / or antipsychotics for bipolar disorder in the maintenance phase: a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^112z1Tak]. Molecular Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We performed a systematic review and NMAs of efficacy, acceptability, tolerability, and safety for mono- or combination therapies using mood stabilizers and/or antipsychotics in the treatment of adult patients with BD in the maintenance phase. We extended a previous NMA by two SGAs (i.e. asenapine and AOM), by investigating many more adverse effects and by examining efficacy and safety of various combination therapies using SGA and LIT/VAL. Overall, most of the mood stabilizers and/or antipsychotics reduced the recurrence/relapse rates of any mood episode. However, when examining individual mood symptoms, both drug types appeared to be more effective for treating mania than depression.

Aripiprazole+valproate was the best treatment for reducing the recurrence/relapse rates of any mood episode and depressive episodes. However, these significances disappeared during sensitivity analyses adjusting for enrichment design and sponsorship. Lithium+oxcarbazepine ranked high with respect to reducing the recurrence/relapse rates of any mood episode (2nd), depressive episodes (2nd), and manic/hypomanic/mixed episodes (3rd). Lamotrigine+valproate ranked third for reducing the recurrence/relapse rate of depressive episodes. However, these results were based on only one small study (< 50 patients in each treatment arm). Lithium+valproate ranked first for all-cause discontinuation, based on the results of a single open-label study. We deemed the result inconclusive, given the CINeMA rating showed low and very low confidence levels for these treatments.

Asenapine ranked high with respect to reducing the recurrence/relapse rates of any mood episode (3rd), manic/hypomanic/mixed episodes (1st), all-cause discontinuation (3rd), and discontinuation due to adverse events (1st), which might represent novel insights into the pharmacological treatment of patients with BD in the maintenance phase. Although it did not prevent recurrence/relapse of depressive episodes, asenapine ranked fifth for outcome. It should be noted that this ranking was made from only one 26-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of asenapine. Furthermore, asenapine carries the risk of oral hypoesthesia, and this distinctive side effect makes it difficult to blind; the asenapine study might therefore be subject to performance and detection biases.

### Pharmacotherapy of bipolar mixed States [^1178D8F6]. Bipolar Disorders (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

Mixed episodes comprise up to 40% of acute bipolar admissions. They are difficult-to-treat, complex clinical pictures. This review provides an overview of the available literature on the pharmacotherapy of manic-depressive mixed states and suggests treatment options.

Method

Literature was identified by searches in Medline, Embase and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register. Studies were considered relevant if they contained the keywords mixed mania, mixed state(s), mixed episode(s), treatment, therapy, study or trial.

Results

Overall, there were very few double-blind, placebo-controlled studies specifically designed to treat manic-depressive mixed states. Rather, patients with mixed states comprised a sub-group of the examined patient cohorts. Nevertheless, the data show that acute mixed states do not respond favourably to lithium. Instead, valproate and olanzapine are drugs of first choice. Carbamazepine may play a role in the prevention of mixed states. Antidepressants should be avoided, because they may worsen intraepisodic mood lability. Lamotrigine may be useful in treating mixed states with predominantly depressive symptoms.

Conclusions

More treatment studies specifically designed to treat the complex clinical picture of mixed states are clearly needed. Current treatment recommendations for clinical practice based on the available literature can only target select aspects of these episodes.

### A single dose of lamotrigine induces a positive memory bias in healthy volunteers [^114WSefJ]. Psychological Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Bipolar disorder (BD) is characterized by recurrent presentations of elevated mood episodes, in the form of either mania or hypomania and depressive episodes (APA). Affecting over 1% of the global population, this severe chronic affective illness is among the leading causes of worldwide disability (Global Burden of Disease Study; Judd et al.). BD's predominant mood state is bipolar depression (Malhi, Mitchell, & Salim). However, most available treatments for BD such as mood stabilizers (i.e. lithium), antiepileptic drugs (i.e. carbamazepine and valproate sodium), or atypical antiepileptic drugs (i.e. olanzapine) exert their effects primarily on mania/hypomania and, to a lesser extent, on depression (Goldsmith, Wagstaff, Ibbotson, & Perry).

Lamotrigine is a relatively new drug that is associated with prevention of depressive episodes within the clinical presentation of BD. First licensed as an add-on treatment for epilepsy, lamotrigine was quickly seen to have beneficial effects in BD, gaining approval in 2003 as a maintenance treatment for BD by the US FDA (Goldsmith et al; Vajda, Dodd, & Horgan). The mechanisms underlying the effects of lamotrigine in BD are not fully understood but have been suggested to involve inhibition of voltage-gated sodium channels and reductions in presynaptic glutamate release (Ketter, Manji, & Post; Lee, Fu, Chen, Su, & Liou; Prica, Hascoet, & Bourin; Sills & Rogawski). Such effects would be expected to counter enhanced excitatory neurotransmission in bipolar disorder (Sanacora, Zarate, Krystal, & Manji).

### Treatment guidelines for bipolar disorder: a critical review [^115so2bi]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2005). Low credibility.

Introduction

The development of treatment guidelines emerged as an important element so as to standardize treatment and to provide clinicians with algorithms, which would be able to carry research findings to the everyday clinical practice.

Material and Method

The MEDLINE was searched with the combination of each one of the key words 'mania', 'manic', 'bipolar', 'manic-depression', 'manic-depressive' with 'treatment guidelines'.

Results

The search was updated until March 1st, 2004 and returned 224 articles. Twenty-seven papers concerning the publication of treatment algorithms were traced.

Discussion

Despite supposedly being evidence-based, guidelines for the treatment of bipolar disorder vary significantly across committees or working groups. Overall, however, at the first stage of the mania/hypomania algorithm, monotherapy with lithium, divalproex sodium or olanzapine is generally recommended. At latter stages combination therapy is strongly recommended. It is clearly stated that in bipolar depression antidepressants should be used only in combination with antimanic agents in order to avoid switching of phases. During the maintenance phase all patients should receive antimanic agents, while some may need the addition of antidepressants. The most recent guidelines emphasize the use of atypical antipsychotics for mania and lamotrigine for depression. The main problem with guidelines is that they are rapidly outdated and that the evidence base relies mainly on registration monotherapy trials that hardly reflect treatment in routine clinical conditions.

Conclusion

Treatment guidelines may be useful to avoid non-evidence-based treatment decisions, but they are quickly out-of-date and may not fully apply to the clinical setting. The more recent guidelines point the value of atypical antipsychotics, lithium, and valproate in the treatment of mania; the role of lithium, lamotrigine, and olanzapine as options for maintenance therapy; and the scarcity of options for the treatment of bipolar depression. Psychoeducation is also supported by most guidelines as an adjunctive treatment.

### Lamotrigine in the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder… [^112F6Pq9]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

Evidence-Based Answer Compared with placebo, lamotrigine reduces the recurrence of manic symptoms at one year and the need for additional psychotropics necessitated by worsening clinical symptoms. The adverse effect profile of lamotrigine is similar to that of placebo. 1 Compared with lithium, lamotrigine is similarly effective at treating recurrences of depressive episodes and any episode requiring additional psychotropic therapy, but it is less effective at reducing the recurrence of manic episodes at one year. Patients using lamotrigine have fewer reported adverse effects and withdrawals from treatment compared with those using lithium.
1.

Compared with placebo, lamotrigine was more effective at reducing the recurrence of manic episodes at one year. Lamotrigine was also more effective than placebo at reducing clinical symptoms requiring additional psychotropic medication. No differences were noted in the recurrence of depressive episodes at one year or in short-term or long-term adverse effects in patients treated with lamotrigine compared with placebo. Fewer study participants receiving lamotrigine stopped taking their medication after six to 12 months of treatment. Among the effectiveness outcomes studied, lamotrigine and lithium had a similar recurrence of depressive symptoms, recurrence of clinical symptoms requiring additional psychotropic therapy, recurrence of manic symptoms using the Young Mania Rating Scale, and active suicidal behavior.

However, lamotrigine was less effective in reducing the recurrence of manic episodes at one year among studies using an assessor's judgment instead of a rating scale. 4 Lamotrigine is an anticonvulsant approved by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration for the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder. It is not effective for treating acute bipolar mania or hypomania. Given the reduced adverse effect profile compared with lithium, lamotrigine may be an appropriate monotherapy during the maintenance phase of bipolar disorder.

### Lamotrigine: when and where does it act in affective disorders? A systematic review [^1179VdeD]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2011). Low credibility.

Recent published data and treatment guidelines have created uncertainty about the use of lamotrigine in affective disorders, especially in acute bipolar depression. Furthermore, unpublished data on lamotrigine in mania, mixed episodes, unipolar depression and rapid cycling are still waiting to be integrated into the literature. Therefore, we critically reviewed the position of lamotrigine in the acute and long-term treatment of affective disorders. Studies were identified by searching English language articles published in MEDLINE using the key words: lamotrigine, bipolar depression, unipolar depression, mania, mixed episode, long-term treatment, rapid-cycling. Results of unpublished trials were obtained from the GlaxoSmithKline website. Lamotrigine showed efficacy in the prophylaxis of bipolar disorder, more so in depressive than manic episodes. There was no evidence of effectiveness in the acute treatment of mania, mixed episodes, unipolar depression or rapid-cycling bipolar I disorder. Its effect in the acute treatment of bipolar depression is at most small. Based on current evidence, lamotrigine is indicated for the prophylaxis of bipolar disorder with predominantly depressive episodes. Its effectiveness in the acute treatment of bipolar depression is open to debate, and practical considerations limit its usefulness here. There are no grounds for recommending its use in manic or mixed states, in rapidly-cycling bipolar I or in unipolar depression.

### Reevaluating therapies for bipolar depression [^115GWPcg]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

The most commonly employed pharmacotherapies for bipolar depression include antidepressants, lithium, and anticonvulsants, such as lamotrigine, valproate, and carbamazepine. A combination of these agents, usually an antidepressant and a mood stabilizer, is often required to achieve an optimal response. However, some treatment guidelines still caution that antidepressant exposure should be minimized in patients with bipolar depression, due to concern that they may trigger treatment-emergent mania or cycle acceleration. This advice prevails despite data showing that antidepressants are effective in treating bipolar depression and evidence that coadministration of a mood-stabilizing medication, at least with modern antidepressants, such as the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, can reduce the risk of treatment-emergent mania to levels comparable with those observed with mood stabilizer monotherapy. Although the antidepressant efficacy of most mood stabilizers has not been satisfactorily proven, first-line therapy with 1 mood stabilizer alone or a combination of 2 mood stabilizers is still recommended by many guidelines. Inappropriate treatment of bipolar depression may leave patients at high risk of suicide and increased chronicity of symptoms; effective therapy should, therefore, be provided as early as possible. The efficacy and safety of antidepressants for bipolar depression both as monotherapy and when combined with a mood stabilizer should be studied in adequately powered trials in order to revise treatment guidelines. Electroconvulsive therapy remains an option for treatment-refractory patients and those intolerant to pharmacologic treatment, as well as patients who are pregnant or at high risk of suicide.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for management of bipolar disorder [^1141LNbd]. VA/DoD (2023). High credibility.

Bipolar disorder — prevention of recurrence of bipolar depression: We recommend lamotrigine for the prevention of recurrence of bipolar depressive episodes (Strong for | Reviewed, New-added). Evidence suggests that treatment with lamotrigine can help prevent the recurrence of depressive episodes in individuals with BD, with trials reporting efficacy for preventing not just mood episodes in general, but depressive episodes in particular; limited comparative evidence found no difference when comparing lamotrigine to lithium, and studies included both BD 1 and BD 2 without distinguishing between groups. As lamotrigine monotherapy has demonstrated effectiveness for prevention of depression but not mania, the Work Group acknowledged that it should be of value specifically in individuals with BD 2. Patient-centered considerations include that the medication is in general well tolerated though a risk of serious side effects (e.g. SJS/TEN) exists, many individuals prefer not to take maintenance medication, and titration can be cumbersome because it requires slow titration over the course of many weeks.

### The Korean medication algorithm project for bipolar disorder (KMAP-BP): changes in preferred treatment strategies and medications over 16 years and five editions [^112gtzpv]. Bipolar Disorders (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The Korean Medication Algorithm Project for Bipolar Disorder (KMAP-BP) is based on expert consensus and has been revised five times since 2002. This study evaluated the changes in treatment strategies advocated by the KMAP-BP over time.

Methods

The five editions of the KMAP-BP were reviewed, and the recommendations of the KMAP-BP were compared with those of other bipolar disorder (BP) treatment guidelines.

Results

The most preferred option for the initial treatment of mania was a combination of a mood stabilizer (MS) and an atypical antipsychotic (AAP). Either MS or AAP monotherapy was also considered a first-line strategy for mania, but not for all types of episodes, including mixed/psychotic mania. In general, although lithium and valproic acid were commonly recommended, valproic acid has been increasingly preferred for all phases of BP. The most notable changes over time included the increasing preference for AAPs for all phases of BP, and lamotrigine for the depressive and maintenance phases. The use of antidepressants for BP has gradually decreased, but still represents a first-line option for severe and psychotic depression.

Conclusions

In general, the recommended strategies of the KMAP-BP were similar to those of other guidelines, but differed in terms of the emphasis on rapid effectiveness, which is often desirable in actual clinical situations. The major limitation of the KMAP-BP is that it is a consensus-based rather than an evidence-based tool. Nevertheless, it may confer advantages in actual clinical practice.

### The use of anticonvulsants in the aftermath of mania [^114W1x1k]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2006). Low credibility.

This paper reviews the evidence for the efficacy of anticonvulsants in the continuation and maintenance phases of treatment of bipolar disorder, when there has been an episode of mania (Bipolar-I disorder). The evidence to be considered is primarily that arising from randomized controlled trials. A literature search was performed to identify all randomized controlled trials of anticonvulsants used as maintenance treatment for bipolar-I disorder. Placebo-controlled studies were preferred, however there have been relatively few of these and clinical practice must therefore be guided by evidence carrying a lower level of conviction. Valproate monotherapy lacks a convincing evidence base. The view that valproate is more effective than lithium in rapid cycling has not been borne out. Lamotrigine is effective in preventing depression after an episode of mania. As monotherapy, lithium appears superior to carbamazepine in bipolar patients not previously treated with either drug. The combination of lithium and carbamazepine may be superior to either drug alone, in certain treatment-resistant patients, but is associated with increased side effects. Other anticonvulsants lack evidence supporting their use in bipolar disorder except in treating co-morbid alcohol dependence, anxiety and bulimic symptoms. Valproate continues to be recommended by most current guidelines despite the lack of evidence.

### Comparative efficacy and tolerability of pharmacological treatments in the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^111Eq1aq]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2014). Medium credibility.

Background

Lithium is the established standard in the long-term treatment of bipolar disorder, but several new drugs have been assessed for this indication. We did a network meta-analysis to investigate the comparative efficacy and tolerability of available pharmacological treatment strategies for bipolar disorder.

Methods

We systematically searched Embase, Medline, PreMedline, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for randomised controlled trials published before June 28, 2013, that compared active treatments for bipolar disorder (or placebo), either as monotherapy or as add-on treatment, for at least 12 weeks. The primary outcomes were the number of participants with recurrence of any mood episode, and the number of participants who discontinued the trial because of adverse events. We assessed efficacy and tolerability of bipolar treatments using a random-effects network meta-analysis within a Bayesian framework.

Findings

We screened 114 potentially eligible studies and identified 33 randomised controlled trials, published between 1970 and 2012, that examined 17 treatments for bipolar disorder (or placebo) in 6846 participants. Participants assigned to all assessed treatments had a significantly lower risk of any mood relapse or recurrence compared with placebo, except for those assigned to aripiprazole (risk ratio [RR] 0·62, 95% credible interval [CrI] 0·38–1·03), carbamazepine (RR 0·68, 0·44–1·06), imipramine (RR 0·95, 0·66–1·36), and paliperidone (RR 0·84, 0·56–1·24). Lamotrigine and placebo were significantly better tolerated than carbamazepine (lamotrigine, RR 5·24, 1·07–26·32; placebo, RR 3·60, 1·04–12·94), lithium (RR 3·76, 1·13–12·66; RR 2·58, 1·33–5·39), or lithium plus valproate (RR 5·95, 1·02–33·33; RR 4·09, 1·01–16·96).

Interpretation

Although most of the drugs analysed were more efficacious than placebo and generally well tolerated, differences in the quality of evidence and the side-effect profiles should be taken into consideration by clinicians and patients. In view of the efficacy in prevention of both manic episode and depressive episode relapse or recurrence and the better quality of the supporting evidence, lithium should remain the first-line treatment when prescribing a relapse-prevention drug in patients with bipolar disorder, notwithstanding its tolerability profile.

Funding

None.

### Valproate [^1168Qgix]. Bipolar Disorders (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

This article summarizes the role of valproate as a treatment for bipolar disorder and related conditions.

Methods

Published studies and reviews were systematically reviewed. Results from randomized, parallel group, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies that included an active comparator are emphasized.

Results

Valproate is an effective treatment for manic patients. Valproate was superior to placebo in one 1-year randomized, parallel group study in rate of recurrence requiring discontinuation, rate of depression requiring discontinuation, total early termination and time to 25% of patients relapsing with mania, and in controlling mild depressive symptoms. On some measures, including time to development of a manic episode, valproate did not differ from placebo. Assessments of maintenance efficacy of valproate and other putative prophylactic treatments for bipolar disorder are problematic, because of the need to analyze multiple indices of efficacy, and practical and ethical issues that limit generalizability of results of placebo-controlled studies. Valproate has some advantages over lithium in treatment of mania for persons with more severe illnesses. Valproate benefits a broader spectrum of bipolar conditions than lithium. Valproate appears at best modestly effective for bipolar depression. Used in combination with several other treatments, additive benefits result, that are greater than with any of the treatments as monotherapy. Side effects are generally mild and manageable, particularly with divalproex. Weight gain and pharmacokinetic interaction with lamotrigine are perhaps the most consistent problems in use. Valproate contributes to neural tube defects if taken during the first trimester of pregnancy, and this risk must be conveyed to women.

Conclusions

Valproate is an effective and useful treatment for bipolar disorder. Studies clarifying its spectrum of efficacy, its safety and efficacy in combination regimens, and its mechanisms of action are warranted.

### Effectiveness of lamotrigine in bipolar disorder in a clinical setting [^116wJhiK]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess lamotrigine effectiveness in bipolar disorder (BD) patients in a clinical setting.

Method

Open lamotrigine was naturalistically administered to outpatients at the Stanford University BD Clinic assessed with the Systematic Treatment Enhancement Program for BD (STEP-BD) Affective Disorders Evaluation, and monitored longitudinally with the STEP-BD Clinical Monitoring Form.

Results

One hundred and ninety-seven patients (64 BD I, 110 BD II, 21 BD NOS, 2 Schizoaffective Bipolar Type, mean ± SD age 42.2 ± 14.4 years, 62% female) had 200 trials of lamotrigine. Lamotrigine was combined with a mean of 2.1 ± 1.5 other psychotropic medications, most often during euthymia or depressive symptoms. Mean lamotrigine duration was 434 ± 444 days, and mean final dose was 236 ± 132mg/day without valproate, and 169 ± 137mg/day with valproate. Lamotrigine was discontinued in only 26.5% of trials at 255 ± 242 days, most often due to inefficacy, and seldom due to adverse effects. In 31.5% of trials lamotrigine was continued 264 ± 375 days with no subsequent psychotropic added. In 42.0% of trials lamotrigine was continued 674 ± 479 days, but had subsequent psychotropic added at 146 ± 150 days, most often for anxiety/insomnia and depressive symptoms. In 145 trials started at Stanford, lamotrigine primarily yielded relief of depressive symptoms or maintained euthymia. In 55 trials in which lamotrigine was started prior to Stanford, lamotrigine primarily maintained euthymia. Lamotrigine was generally well tolerated, with no serious rash, and only 3.5% discontinuing due to benign rash.

Conclusion

In a cohort of bipolar disorder outpatients commonly with comorbid conditions, and most often receiving complex combination therapy, lamotrigine had a low (26.5%, with an overall mean duration of treatment of 434 days) discontinuation rate, suggesting effectiveness in BD in a clinical setting.

VA/DoD bipolar disorder guideline — vitamin B9 (folic acid) as adjunctive treatment summarizes that evidence from three RCTs within two systematic reviews (SRs) suggested folic acid might improve manic symptoms but not depressive symptoms in BD; a small RCT showed significant improvement in manic symptoms with sodium valproate plus 3 mg per day of folic acid versus placebo, while another RCT showed no difference in depressive symptoms when adding 500 mcg per day of folic acid to quetiapine and lamotrigine, and a third RCT showed no difference for depression when adding folic acid versus placebo; overall confidence was low because of small sample sizes and imprecision, and concurrent folic acid might reduce the effectiveness of lamotrigine.

### Comparative economic evaluation of quetiapine plus lamotrigine combination vs quetiapine monotherapy (and folic acid vs placebo) in patients with bipolar depression (CEQUEL) [^112gbqBs]. Bipolar Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

2.1 Study design and study population

CEQUEL was a multi‐centre (27 sites), double‐blind, randomized, placebo‐controlled, parallel group, 2 × 2 factorial clinical trial conducted in the UK (for more details on the clinical study, see Geddes et al 9). The clinical trial was registered with EudraCT, number 2007‐004513‐33 and approved by the Oxfordshire REC B ethics committee. Patient inclusion criteria were a primary diagnosis of bipolar disorder type I or II based on DSM‐IV 14 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders — IV) criteria for hypomanic or manic episode, a current depressive episode requiring new pharmacological treatment, informed consent and aged 16 years or over. Following a 7‐14 days run‐in phase on quetiapine monotherapy, 202 participants were randomized to the following added medication (see Figure 1 for an overview): 101 participants to lamotrigine (200 mg/d; 100 mg/d with concurrent valproate and 400 mg/d with concurrent combined oral contraceptives), 101 to placebo lamotrigine. Additionally, participants not currently taking folic acid and without contraindications to do so were assigned to folic acid (500 µg/d) or placebo folic acid. Out of the 202 study participants, 94 participants were thus separately randomized to folic acid and 92 participants to placebo folic acid. Sixteen participants were not randomized to the folic acid/placebo comparison. One participant died during the 52 weeks follow‐up (suicide; group allocation: placebo lamotrigine/active folic acid) and was excluded from the health economic analysis. Table 1 presents the baseline characteristics of the 201 analysed participants.

### Discontinuation of psychotropic medication: a synthesis of evidence across medication classes [^116tnmCt]. Molecular Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Discontinuation symptoms (DS)

Lithium: discontinuation of lithium may lead to irritability, anxiety, restlessness, vertigo, dizziness, and lightheadedness, particularly in the first week. Symptoms are generally mild and self-limiting. Abruptly or rapidly stopping lithium (within 2 weeks) can lead to "rebound" manic and depressive episodes. There is no strong evidence that lithium is less effective when discontinued and restarted, compared to continuous treatment, a phenomenon that has been seen in anecdotal case reports and in about 15% of patients across seven published cohort studies.

Valproate/carbamazepine/lamotrigine: for carbamazepine, valproate, and lamotrigine, discontinuation phenomena include anxiety, agitation, irritability, lack of energy, depression, insomnia, depersonalization, and impaired concentration and memory.

Antipsychotics: SGA's have been addressed in the section on antipsychotics above.

Risk factors for relapse following discontinuation

In bipolar disorder, young age of onset, psychotic features, numerous previous episodes, rapid cycling, comorbid anxiety, comorbid substance use, and persistent subthreshold symptoms are risk factors for recurrence, even during maintenance treatment. These factors likely increase the risk of relapse following discontinuation, although direct evidence is lacking.

When to discontinue?

Most guidelines recommend that mood stabilizers for acute manic or depressive episodes be continued at least for several months after symptomatic remission (i.e. during the continuation treatment phase following the acute treatment and preceding maintenance treatment), but evidence is scarce. However, in most patients with bipolar disorder it is recommended that a mood stabilizer should be continued for long-term maintenance treatment to prevent recurrences and improve inter-episodic functioning.

### A placebo-controlled 18-month trial of lamotrigine and lithium maintenance treatment in recently depressed patients with bipolar I disorder [^116vvfka]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Background

The anticonvulsant lamotrigine was previously shown to be effective for bipolar depression. This study assessed the efficacy and tolerability of lamotrigine and lithium compared with placebo for the prevention of mood episodes in bipolar disorder.

Method

During an 8- to 16-week open-label phase, lamotrigine (titrated to 200 mg/day) was added to current therapy for currently or recently depressed DSM-IV-defined bipolar I outpatients (N = 966) and concomitant drugs were gradually withdrawn. Patients stabilized on open-label treatment (N = 463) were then randomly assigned to lamotrigine (50, 200, or 400 mg/day; N = 221), lithium (0.8–1.1 mEq/L; N = 121), or placebo (N = 121) monotherapy for up to 18 months. The primary outcome measure was time from randomization to intervention (addition of pharmacotherapy) for any mood episode (depressive, manic, hypomanic, or mixed). Data were gathered from September 1997 to August 2001.

Results

Time to intervention for any mood episode was statistically superior (p = .029) for both lamotrigine and lithium compared with placebo-median survival times were 200, 170, and 93 days, respectively. Intervention for depression was more frequent than for mania by a factor of nearly 3:1. Lamotrigine was statistically superior to placebo at prolonging the time to intervention for a depressive episode (p = .047). The proportions of patients who were intervention-free for depression at 1 year were lamotrigine 57%, lithium 46%, and placebo 45%. Lithium was statistically superior to placebo at prolonging the time to intervention for a manic or hypomanic episode (p = .026). The proportions of patients who were intervention-free for mania at 1 year were lamotrigine 77%, lithium 86%, and placebo 72%. Headache was the most frequent adverse event for all 3 treatment groups.

Conclusion

Lamotrigine and lithium were superior to placebo for the prevention of mood episodes in bipolar I patients, with lamotrigine predominantly effective against depression and lithium predominantly effective against mania.

### Pharmacological treatment of adult bipolar disorder [^1149W4nV]. Molecular Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

We summarize evidence supporting contemporary pharmacological treatment of phases of BD, including: mania, depression, and long-term recurrences, emphasizing findings from randomized, controlled trials (RCTs). Effective treatment of acute or dysphoric mania is provided by modern antipsychotics, some anticonvulsants (divalproex and carbamazepine), and lithium salts. Treatment of BD-depression remains unsatisfactory but includes some modern antipsychotics (particularly lurasidone, olanzapine+fluoxetine, and quetiapine) and the anticonvulsant lamotrigine; value and safety of antidepressants remain controversial. Long-term prophylactic treatment relies on lithium, off-label use of valproate, and growing use of modern antipsychotics. Lithium has unique evidence of antisuicide effects. Methods of evaluating treatments for BD rely heavily on meta-analysis, which is convenient but with important limitations. Underdeveloped treatment for BD-depression may reflect an assumption that effects of antidepressants are similar in BD as in unipolar major depressive disorder. Effective prophylaxis of BD is limited by the efficacy of available treatments and incomplete adherence owing to adverse effects, costs, and lack of ongoing symptoms. Long-term treatment of BD also is limited by access to, and support of expert, comprehensive clinical programs. Pursuit of improved, rationally designed pharmacological treatments for BD, as for most psychiatric disorders, is fundamentally limited by lack of coherent pathophysiology or etiology.

Regarding depressive episodes with mixed features, only combination therapy of lithium and an atypical antipsychotic was categorized as a first‐line treatment for BP‐I (7.1 ± 2.0) (Table 2). Second‐line treatments were lithium monotherapy (6.7 ± 2.2), combination therapy of valproic acid and an atypical antipsychotic (6.5 ± 2.1), olanzapine monotherapy (6.3 ± 2.3), and combination therapy of lithium and valproic acid (6.3 ± 2.2). None of the choices were categorized as a first‐line treatment for depressive episodes with mixed features in BP‐II. The following choices were categorized as second‐line treatments: lithium monotherapy (6.7 ± 2.3), combination therapy of lithium and an atypical antipsychotic (6.6 ± 2.3), quetiapine monotherapy (6.2 ± 2.4), combination therapy of valproic acid and an atypical antipsychotic (6.1 ± 2.3), and olanzapine monotherapy (6.1 ± 2.3).

3.4 Maintenance treatment for bipolar disorder

Lithium monotherapy was considered a treatment of choice for the maintenance phase in BP‐I (7.8 ± 1.8) and a first‐line treatment in BP‐II (7.3 ± 2.3) (Table 3). Combination therapy of lithium and an atypical antipsychotic was categorized as a first‐line treatment for the maintenance phase in BP‐I (6.9 ± 2.1) and a second‐line treatment in BP‐II (6.7 ± 2.2). These were followed by second‐line choices, including combination therapy of lithium and lamotrigine (6.4 ± 2.5), combination therapy of lithium and valproic acid (6.4 ± 2.4), and lamotrigine monotherapy (6.2 ± 2.3) for BP‐I, and lamotrigine monotherapy (6.4 ± 2.5), quetiapine monotherapy (6.2 ± 2.3), and combination therapy of lamotrigine and an atypical antipsychotic (6.1 ± 2.3) for BP‐II.

1 INTRODUCTION

Worldwide, mental and substance abuse disorders accounted for 8.6 million years lived with disability (YLD) in 2010, making it the number one cause of YLDs. 7.4% of it are attributed to bipolar disorders, 1 ranking them 18th for all global years lived with disability and 6th of all mental and behavioural disorders. 2 Bipolar disorders are associated with reduced life expectancy by 11‐20 years 3 and a 20% higher risk of suicide 4 compared to the general population as well as reduced quality of life for both the people affected 5 and their families. 6 These adverse outcomes are especially related to the depressive episodes of bipolar disorders. In addition, bipolar disorders cause high direct healthcare costs and substantial societal costs due to patients' production losses. 7

Quetiapine or lamotrigine is among the few treatment options recommended by NICE (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence) guidelines 8 for treatment of bipolar depression. However, monotherapy is associated with limited efficacy or, in the case of lamotrigine, switch to mania, while combination therapies appear to be associated with better outcomes. 9 Thus, lamotrigine in combination with lithium therapy was found to be effective in the LamLit trial. 10 The CEQUEL trial investigated if quetiapine combined with lamotrigine resulted in greater improvement in depressive symptoms than quetiapine monotherapy. Since there was also some evidence that folic acid, a widely accessible over‐the‐counter drug, is an effective treatment option for patients with unipolar depression, 11 its add‐on effect was also investigated using a factorial design.

In the CEQUEL trial, a lower mean QIDS‐SR16 (Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology — self report version) total score for the group receiving lamotrigine vs the placebo group was observed at 12 weeks (−1.73, 95% CI: −3.57 to 0.11, P = 0.066) and at 52 weeks (−2.69, 95% CI: −4.89 to −0.49, P = 0.017), implying that quetiapine‐lamotrigine combination therapy improved depressive symptoms more than quetiapine alone. Accordingly, lamotrigine's use was recommended in the recent BAP (British Association for Psychopharmacology) bipolar guidelines. 12 Addition of folic acid was not found to be superior to placebo but, rather, to reduce the effect of lamotrigine. 9

Acute bipolar depression adjunctive therapy — We suggest lamotrigine in combination with lithium or quetiapine for acute bipolar depression (Weak for | Reviewed, New-added). A systematic review (SR) and network meta-analysis reported five studies of adjunctive lamotrigine in mixed samples of individuals with bipolar disorder (BD), with primary analysis treatment response favoring lamotrigine (RR: 1.43; 95% CI: 1.00–2.04); there were no significant effects in analyses limited to BD 1 or BD 2, the quality of evidence was very low, and secondary analyses found no significant differences in symptoms or remission. In randomized controlled trials (RCTs), adjunctive lamotrigine with lithium produced significant changes in provider-rated symptoms and response rates based on > 50% reductions at 6 and 8 weeks; as an adjunct to quetiapine, patient-reported symptoms were significantly greater than placebo at one year with low quality of evidence, and remission was greater at 12 weeks and one year, but not at 22 weeks; neither study reported outcomes specifically for BD 1 or BD 2 subtypes.

### A pooled analysis of 2 placebo-controlled 18-month trials of lamotrigine and lithium maintenance in bipolar I disorder [^111zXUpk]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Two clinical trials, prospectively designed for combined analysis, compared placebo, lithium, and lamotrigine for treatment of bipolar I disorder in recently depressed or manic patients.

Method

1315 bipolar I patients (DSM-IV) enrolled in the initial open-label phase, and 638 were stabilized and randomly assigned to 18 months of double-blind monotherapy with lamotrigine (N = 280; 50–400 mg/day fixed dose or 100–400 mg/day flexible dose), lithium (N = 167; serum level of 0.8–1.1 mEq/L), or placebo (N = 191). The primary endpoint was time from randomization to intervention for a mood episode. Data were gathered from August 1997 to August 2001.

Results

Lamotrigine and lithium were superior to placebo for time to intervention for any mood episode (median survival: placebo, 86 days [95% CI = 58 to 121]; lithium, 184 days [95% CI = 119 to not calculable]; lamotrigine, 197 days [95% CI = 144 to 388]). Lamotrigine was superior to placebo for time to intervention for depression (median survival: placebo, 270 days [95% CI = 138 to not calculable]; lithium, median not calculable; lamotrigine, median not calculable). Lithium and lamotrigine were superior to placebo for time to intervention for mania (median survival not calculable for any group). Results of additional analyses adjusted for index mood were similar; however, only lithium was superior to placebo for intervention for mania. There was no evidence that either active treatment caused affective switch. Adverse event analysis indicated more diarrhea (19% vs. 7%, p < .05) and tremor (15% vs. 4%, p < .05) in lithium-treated patients compared with lamotrigine-treated patients.

Conclusions

Lamotrigine and lithium stabilized mood by delaying the time to treatment for a mood episode. Lamotrigine was effective against depression and mania, with more robust activity against depression. Lithium was effective against mania.

Other common treatments for BD-D

The US FDA approval process relies on a review of manufacturer-provided information regarding safety and effectiveness of a drug for specific indications. Once approved for a specific indication, 'off label' use is allowed. There are several drugs not approved by the FDA that are commonly used 'off label' for treatment of BD-D and have substantial supporting evidence.

Classic mood stabilisers

Lithium is effective in the acute treatment of mania and long-term maintenance of mood and prophylaxis, and may be particularly effective in a subset of patients. There are few trials comparing lithium with placebo for BD-D, but a small study of 29 patients with acute depression assigned to lithium or imipramine after a placebo trial found a 32% reduction in depressive symptoms among patients treated with lithium for 4 weeks. Despite clear evidence of long-term benefits, including robust antisuicidal effects, the evidence for rapid or short-term benefits of lithium in acute BD-D is generally considered modest.

Of the antiepileptic mood stabilisers, lamotrigine, which has been found to have antidepressant effects in placebo-controlled trials, may be best supported. In a meta-analysis of five RCTs (n = 1072), lamotrigine improved MADRS, with a relative risk (RR) of 1.22 (95% CI: 1.06 to 1.41, p = 0.005). The author concludes that the overall pool effect was modest, although the advantage over placebo was larger in patients with more severe depression. Some evidence also exists for use of carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine as secondary choices. In a meta-analysis of monotherapy (including lamotrigine, carbamazepine and valproic acid), mood stabilisers are moderately efficacious for acute BD-D (RR = 1.30, 95% CI: 1.16 to 1.44; NNT = 10, 95% CI: 7 to 18), but studies are few and limited by the high rates of discontinuation.

### Comparative economic evaluation of quetiapine plus lamotrigine combination vs quetiapine monotherapy (and folic acid vs placebo) in patients with bipolar depression (CEQUEL) [^113C4aTy]. Bipolar Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

In fact, the adoption of lamotrigine has lagged behind that of other new drugs used in bipolar disorders in the UK. 13 This probably reflects the absence of a marketing authorization for its use in bipolar depression. Therefore, evidence for efficacy and cost‐effectiveness from independent clinical trials is of critical importance in improving practice. The analysis of further data from CEQUEL on quality of life, costs and cost‐effectiveness over 52 weeks of treatment of patients with bipolar disorders here contributes a complementary perspective for considering the regular use of lamotrigine.

14.2. Bipolar Disorder

Adults The effectiveness of lamotrigine in the maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder was established in 2 multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in adult patients (aged 18 to 82 years) who met DSM-IV criteria for bipolar I disorder. Trial 1 enrolled patients with a current or recent (within 60 days) depressive episode as defined by DSM-IV and Trial 2 included patients with a current or recent (within 60 days) episode of mania or hypomania as defined by DSM-IV. Both trials included a cohort of patients (30% of 404 subjects in trial 1 and 28% of 171 patients in Trial 2) with rapid cycling bipolar disorder (4 to 6 episodes per year).

In both trials, patients were titrated to a target dose of 200 mg of lamotrigine, as add-on therapy or as monotherapy, with gradual withdrawal of any psychotropic medications during an 8- to 16-week open-label period. Overall 81% of 1,305 patients participating in the open-label period were receiving 1 or more other psychotropic medications, including benzodiazepines, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), atypical antipsychotics (including olanzapine), valproate, or lithium, during titration of lamotrigine. Patients with a CGI-severity score of 3 or less maintained for at least 4 continuous weeks, including at least the final week on monotherapy with lamotrigine, were randomized to a placebo-controlled, double-blind treatment period for up to 18 months. The primary endpoint was TIME (time to intervention for a mood episode or one that was emerging, time to discontinuation for either an adverse event that was judged to be related to bipolar disorder, or for lack of efficacy). The mood episode could be depression, mania, hypomania, or a mixed episode.

Lithium. In three placebo‐controlled RCTs conducted in the 1970s and 1980s (duration = 11‐25 months), lithium decreased the frequency and/or severity of hypomanic and depressive episodes. 399, 450, 452 Serum lithium levels were 0.8‐1.2 mEq/L. A number of active comparator studies also support lithium. As noted above, lithium was as effective as quetiapine in preventing relapse in a 6‐month single‐blind trial. 453 A 20‐month study comparing lithium and divalproex in rapid cycling BDI + BDII found the two drugs to be equally effective in preventing relapses. 496 The authors noted that findings were similar for BDII and BDI, but results were otherwise not reported separately for BDII. In a 2.5‐year study in BDII + BD NOS, lithium and carbamazepine were equally effective on most outcomes, although a numerical advantage favoured carbamazepine for reducing clinical plus subclinical recurrence. 405 In contrast, head‐to‐head comparisons with antidepressants (reviewed below) found that lithium was not as effective in preventing depressive relapse as fluoxetine or venlafaxine. 469, 497 This may be explained by the mean lithium levels, which were 0.7 mEq/L in both studies, while the fluoxetine trial was also enriched for fluoxetine responders.

Long‐term naturalistic data also provide strong support for lithium. In a 6‐year study of patients with either BDI or BDII (39% with BDII), lithium reduced time in hypomania/mania by 61% and time in depression by 53% in the entire sample, compared with the period before lithium treatment was initiated. 498 The authors noted that the proportion of time with mood symptoms was significantly lower for BDII than for BDI.

Lamotrigine. In a 6‐month placebo‐controlled RCT of lamotrigine monotherapy in rapid cycling BDI + BDII, post hoc analysis showed that significantly more lamotrigine‐treated than placebo‐treated patients with BDII were stable without recurrence into any mood episode, 323 although lamotrigine was not superior to placebo in BDI. In a large 52‐week RCT in BDI + BDII, adjunctive lamotrigine was superior to placebo for improving depression severity and remission rates. However, results were not presented separately for BDII. 251 Open‐label trials and retrospective chart reviews also support lamotrigine. 248, 499, 500, 501, 502

### Effectiveness of mood stabilizers and antipsychotics in the maintenance phase of bipolar disorder: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials [^112WGi6a]. Bipolar Disorders (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Bipolar disorder (BD) is a leading cause of disability. Systematic reviews of randomized trials for the treatment of the maintenance phase of BD are lacking.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy and tolerability of mood stabilizers and antipsychotics in the maintenance treatment of BD.

Methods

We systematically reviewed randomized controlled trials of licensed medications for the treatment of any phase of BD. We included randomized controlled trials comparing a medication to placebo or another medication. Comprehensive searches of electronic databases were conducted to March 2005. Outcomes investigated were relapse due to mania, depression or any mood episode, and withdrawal due to any reason or due to an adverse event. Data were combined through meta-analysis.

Results

Fourteen studies (n = 2,526) met the inclusion criteria. Lithium, lamotrigine, olanzapine and valproate semisodium each demonstrated evidence to support long-term use. Compared with placebo, all medications were more effective at preventing relapse because of any mood episode. Hazard ratios (HR) were 0.68 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.53–0.86] for lithium, 0.68 (95% CI = 0.55–0.85) for lamotrigine, and 0.82 (95% CI = 0.57–1.20) for valproate semisodium; for olanzapine, the risk ratio (RR) was 0.58 (95% CI = 0.49–0.69). Lithium and olanzapine significantly reduced manic relapses (HR = 0.53; 95% CI = 0.35–0.79 and RR = 0.37; 95% CI = 0.24–0.57, respectively). Lamotrigine and valproate semisodium significantly reduced depressive relapses (HR = 0.65; 95% CI = 0.46–0.91 and RR = 0.40; 95% CI = 0.20–0.82, respectively). Lithium significantly reduced manic relapses compared with lamotrigine (HR = 0.56; 95% CI = 0.34–0.92) and olanzapine significantly reduced manic relapses compared with lithium (RR = 1.69; 95% CI = 1.12–2.55). Withdrawal due to an adverse event was approximately twice as likely with lithium compared with valproate semisodium (RR = 1.81; 95% CI = 1.08–3.03) and lamotrigine (RR = 2.20; 95% CI = 1.31–3.70). There were few data for carbamazepine or medications given as adjunct therapy.

Conclusions

Mood stabilizers have differing profiles of efficacy and tolerability, suggesting complementary roles in long-term maintenance treatment.

### Employing pharmacologic treatment of bipolar disorder to greatest effect [^114RZZv3]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Mechanisms of action, onset and duration of action, and interactions with other medications — all of these pharmacokinetic properties of pharmacologic agents affect the efficacy and safety of therapeutic regimens for bipolar disorder. For example, antiglutamatergic agents such as lamotrigine may relieve depression but have no impact on mania. Atypical antipsychotics with the dual effect of blocking dopamine and serotonin receptors in the brain decrease psychosis, mania, and, according to some preliminary indications, possibly depression. The impact of these properties has been borne out in clinical studies. Mood stabilizers such as lithium and valproate stabilize mood by significantly decreasing the manic and hypomanic symptoms of bipolar disorder, although they can have effects on depressive symptoms too. Lamotrigine stabilizes mood by reducing depression. The atypical anti-psychotics have been shown to be effective either as monotherapy or in combination with mood stabilizers.

### Six month trial of lamotrigine vs. sodium valproate for treatment of mixed mania… [^113dSrC2]. ClinicalTrials (2005). Low credibility.

Lamotrigine was postulated to decrease glutamate release by acting at voltage-sensitive sodium channel in their refractory phase, stabilizing presynaptic neuronal membranes and inhibiting pathologic release of glutamate. As abnormalities in glutamatergic system have been implicated in depression, and NMDA receptor antagonists reverse anxiety or depression in various stress models, lamotrigine could act as an antidepressant. Thus, lamotrigine has a potential to have both antimanic and antidepressant activity, and in theory should be uniquely effective for mixed mania. Indeed, clinical trials reviewed in detail by Hurley, demonstrated that lamotrigine is somewhat effective an antimanic agent, and has significant antidepressant activity in bipolar depression. Of note, although Sporn and Sachs reported a switch from depression to rapid cycling, such incidences were few.

In our institution, lamotrigine was effective for treatment of mixed mania and bipolar depression in patients receiving standard maintenance treatment for Bipolar Mood Disorder. Lamotrigine did worsen agitation in two elderly patients with symptoms of irritable mania. Hypothesis/Objectives Objective One. To compare the efficacy of the lamotrigine with sodium valproate for treatment of depressive symptoms of acute mania in patients with Bipolar Mood Disorder. Hypothesis One: Lamotrigine will be more effective than sodium valproate in treatment of depressive symptoms in acute mixed mania. Objective Three. To compare the efficacy of lamotrigine to that of sodium valproate in maintenance treatment of patients with bipolar mood disorder and a recent past episode of mixed mania. Hypothesis Three: The lamlotrigine will be more efficacious than sodium valproate in maintenance treatment of patients with bipolar mood disorder and a recent past episode of mixed mania.

The lamotrigine patients will have lower relapse rate. The lamotrigine patients will have lower rates of depression than patients treated with sodium valproate. Objective Four: To compare the side effect profile of lamotrigine treatment of mixed mania to sodium valproate treatment of mixed mania in patients with bipolar mood disorder and a recent past episode of mixed mania.

### A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of augmentation with lamotrigine or placebo in patients concomitantly treated with fluoxetine for resistant major depressive episodes [^117V1Ljv]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Evidence of the antidepressant efficacy of lamotrigine is increasing, although there are no placebo-controlled trials of lamotrigine augmentation in depression. The aim of this study was to assess if augmentation with lamotrigine was superior to placebo in patients who were receiving fluoxetine for resistant major depressive episodes.

Method

Twenty-three patients who had experienced at least 1 major depressive episode that was resistant to at least 1 prior trial of antidepressant therapy were selected. These patients were treated with fluoxetine, 20 mg/day, and concomitantly randomly assigned to receive either lamotrigine (N = 13) or placebo (N = 10) for 6 weeks. The dose of lamotrigine was titrated upward from 25 mg/day to 100 mg/day. Patients suffering from bipolar II disorder (N = 8) or from major depressive disorder (N = 15) (DSM-IV criteria) were enrolled, resulting in heterogeneity of the sample. The primary outcome measure was Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression score. Data were collected from 2000–2001.

Results

Lamotrigine was statistically superior to placebo on the Clinical Global Impressions scale at endpoint, both in absolute terms (mean ± SD Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness scores: lamotrigine, 2.15 ± 1.28; placebo, 3.40 ± 1.17; p = .0308) and using a responder analysis, with response defined as a Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement score of 2 or less (lamotrigine, 84.62% [N = 11]; placebo, 30.00% [N = 3]; p = .013). The effect of lamotrigine on Clinical Global Impressions scale scores was seen in both major depressive disorder and bipolar II disorder. Lamotrigine, however, failed to separate statistically from placebo on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression and Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale. This failure to differentiate on a primary outcome measure is essentially a negative study result. This result is most likely an artifact of the small sample size used and the resultant limited power of the study.

Conclusion

The results of this trial add to the literature suggesting potential efficacy of the antidepressant profile of lamotrigine. In addition, this study points to a possible role of lamotrigine as an augmentation agent in depression.

Because patients with bipolar disorder often do not respond sufficiently to treatment with 1 mood stabilizer, psychiatrists frequently employ combination therapy and add antipsychotics, antiepileptics, or antidepressants to mood stabilizers. Combination therapy can be more effective than monotherapy in controlling breakthrough or treatment-resistant episodes. For example, atypical antipsychotics have been shown to be effective adjunctive treatments for mania and for patients with psychotic symptoms during a depressive episode, while the combination of a mood stabilizer and lamotrigine or an anti-depressant has been found to control bipolar depression. The American Psychiatric Association guideline for the treatment of bipolar disorder recommends optimizing individual medications before switching to combination therapy. Selecting a combination treatment regimen with an acceptable side effect profile is critically important because patients may discontinue therapy they cannot tolerate. Agents should be added carefully, with continued monitoring of adverse effects. Physicians should give patients only as much medication as needed.

Discussion

As prudently stated by Cohen', Medications that do not work on average may help some patients, and medications that do work on average will not be appropriate for all patients. Individual cases require thoughtful trials of the alternatives tailored to each person'. This may be especially important in BD-D, which is a particularly difficult state to treat. Clinical decision making for this disorder may be best thought of on a case-by-case basis.

Additionally, prospective data are needed to further inform the long-term risk versus benefit trade-offs of atypical antipsychotics in BD-D. While the FDA-approved medications do clearly impact the severity of depressive episodes, long-term use of antipsychotics has significant adverse effects; they are often discontinued due to intolerability, and when continued as maintenance therapy, there is little guidance as very few studies have looked beyond the acute phase of treatment in BD-D. In a recent study that did attempt to assess the value of mood stabilisers, antipsychotics and antiepileptics during the maintenance phase, the following medications outperformed placebo: aripiprazole plus valproate, lamotrigine, lamotrigine plus valproate, lithium, olanzapine, and quetiapine. However, it is important to consider that trials examining antipsychotics versus placebo are sparse, and more studies are required to allow more reliable clinically definitive outcomes. Similarly, head-to-head comparisons between treatments for BD-D are limited. As such, there have been efforts to compare treatments for BD-D, but these efforts are significantly limited.

Many have called for renewed consideration of antidepressants when used in combination with mood-stabilising medications, and recent review articles on the acute use of antidepressants in BD-D highlight a compelling need for further studies with longer follow-up periods and careful definition of emerging mania. Others have suggested that, while the risk of mania induction with antidepressants exists, it may have historically been overestimated. Further, 'proneness' towards pharmacologically induced mania via antidepressant use may occur in a clinical subpopulation, suggesting that others may be at relatively lower risk. It is thus reasonable to conceptualise antidepressant risk and likely therapeutic benefit as complex and multideterminant phenomena. Factors that one might consider in this debate are history of antidepressant-induced mania, bipolar subtype, existence of rapid cycling, recency of last manic episode, comorbid substance use, antidepressant class and choice of concurrent mood stabiliser.

14.2 Bipolar Disorder

Adults

The effectiveness of LAMICTAL in the maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder was established in 2 multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in adult patients (aged 18 to 82 years) who met DSM-IV criteria for bipolar I disorder. Trial 1 enrolled patients with a current or recent (within 60 days) depressive episode as defined by DSM-IV and Trial 2 included patients with a current or recent (within 60 days) episode of mania or hypomania as defined by DSM-IV. Both trials included a cohort of patients (30% of 404 subjects in Trial 1 and 28% of 171 patients in Trial 2) with rapid cycling bipolar disorder (4 to 6 episodes per year).

In both trials, patients were titrated to a target dose of 200 mg of LAMICTAL as add-on therapy or as monotherapy with gradual withdrawal of any psychotropic medications during an 8- to 16-week open-label period. Overall 81% of 1,305 patients participating in the open-label period were receiving 1 or more other psychotropic medications, including benzodiazepines, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), atypical antipsychotics (including olanzapine), valproate, or lithium, during titration of LAMICTAL. Patients with a CGI-severity score of 3 or less maintained for at least 4 continuous weeks, including at least the final week on monotherapy with LAMICTAL, were randomized to a placebo-controlled double-blind treatment period for up to 18 months. The primary endpoint was TIME (time to intervention for a mood episode or one that was emerging, time to discontinuation for either an adverse event that was judged to be related to bipolar disorder, or for lack of efficacy). The mood episode could be depression, mania, hypomania, or a mixed episode.

5.5.4 Step 4: add on or switch therapy (second‐line agents)

Second‐line

Although olanzapine (level 1) 381, 382 is effective in preventing any mood, manic or depressive episode, it is considered second‐line treatment because of safety issues such as metabolic syndrome. Biweekly long‐acting injectable risperidone monotherapy (level 1) 383 or adjunctive therapy (level 2) 384 has demonstrated efficacy in preventing any mood or manic episode, but had no clear efficacy in depressive episode prevention in these trials. Further, there was a trend for superiority of oral risperidone adjunctive therapy at 6 months in preventing any mood episode and in preventing mania but not depression. 367 Carbamazepine (level 2) has not been assessed in any large placebo‐controlled trials, but active comparator trials support its efficacy. 385 Paliperidone (level 2) was more effective than placebo in preventing any mood or manic episode but less effective than olanzapine. 386

Ziprasidone oral adjunctive therapy (level 2) 387 has been shown to be effective in preventing any mood or manic episode, although there are conflicting (positive and negative) data for acute treatment (see Sections 3 and 4). There was a trend for superiority of lurasidone adjunctive therapy in preventing any mood episode (but not manic or depressive episodes individually) in a controlled trial with significant separation from placebo in preventing mood episodes in those with an index depressive episode. 388 Thus, lurasidone adjunctive therapy may be appropriate for those who responded to this medication during an index depressive episode.

5.5.5 Step 5: add on or switch therapy (third‐line agents)

Third‐line

Third‐line agents are listed alphabetically in Table 18. There was a trend for superiority of adjunctive aripiprazole with lamotrigine (level 2) 389 compared to lamotrigine monotherapy in preventing mania; thus, this combination may provide additional prophylaxis for patients on lamotrigine monotherapy in preventing manic relapses. Clozapine (level 4) 162 and gabapentin (level 4) 390 may also be useful adjunctive treatments for those who incompletely respond to first‐ or second‐line therapies. The olanzapine/fluoxetine combination appears to maintain mood stability over a 6‐month period in patients with bipolar depression who respond acutely to this combination (level 2). 391

Responders to lamotrigine have a predominantly depressive polarity as well as comorbid anxiety. 420, 421 Lamotrigine monotherapy is not appropriate for patients with frequent manic episodes, as it has limited efficacy in preventing mania.

Quetiapine has been shown to be effective in preventing manic, depressive and mixed episodes in patients with index manic, depressive and mixed episodes, and thus may be particularly valuable in those with mixed features. 422 Asenapine appears to be effective in preventing both mania and depression, although the magnitude of prophylactic efficacy is greater for mania relative to depression. In a randomized open trial of carbamazepine versus lithium, responders to carbamazepine were more likely to have an atypical illness, BDII or schizoaffective disorder. 405

Data to differentiate anti‐psychotic medication responders from non‐responders are lacking.

Overall, some of these possible predictors can have clinical utility, but not all are practical. For instance, it is difficult to evaluate a pre‐treatment course in patients who started their treatment after one or two episodes (practice recommended by most treatment guidelines), and biomarkers are intriguing but lack sufficient replication and are not readily available.

In patients with a history of a rapid cycling course, as indicated in previous sections, factors associated with rapid cycling must be addressed. These include discontinuation of stimulants and antidepressants and treating hypothyroidism if present. With regard to treatment options, the evidence suggests that monotherapy with a single mood stabilizer is often ineffective and patients may require a combination of mood stabilizers to achieve mood stability.

### Efficacy and safety of lamotrigine as add-on treatment to lithium in bipolar depression: a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^1155pfm9]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

Lamotrigine is one of the pharmacologic options for the treatment of bipolar depression but has only been studied as monotherapy. This study compared the acute effects of lamotrigine and placebo as add-on therapy to ongoing treatment with lithium in patients with bipolar depression.

Method

Outpatients (N = 124) aged 18 years and older with a DSM-IV bipolar I or II disorder and a major depressive episode (Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale [MADRS] score ≥ 18 and Clinical Global Impressions-Bipolar Version [CGI-BP] severity of depression score ≥ 4) while receiving lithium treatment (0.6–1.2 mmol/L) were randomly assigned to 8 weeks of double-blind treatment with lamotrigine (titrated to 200 mg/d) or placebo. The primary outcome measure was mean change from baseline in total score on the MADRS at week 8. Secondary outcome measures were response (defined as a reduction of ≥ 50% on the MADRS and/or change of depression score on the CGI-BP of "much improved" or "very much improved" compared to baseline) and switch to mania or hypomania (defined as a CGI-BP severity of mania score of at least mildly ill at any visit). Patients were included in the study between August 2002 (Spain started in October 2003) and May 2005.

Results

Endpoint mean change from baseline MADRS total score was -15.38 (SE = 1.32) points for lamotrigine and -11.03 (SE = 1.36) points for placebo (t = -2.29, df = 104, p = .024). Significantly more patients responded to lamotrigine than to placebo on the MADRS (51.6% vs. 31.7%, p = .030), but not on the CGI-BP change of depression (64.1% vs. 49.2%, p = .105). Switch to mania or hypomania occurred in 5 patients (7.8%) receiving lamotrigine and 2 patients (3.3%) receiving placebo (p = .441).

Conclusion

Lamotrigine was found effective and safe as add-on treatment to lithium in the acute treatment of bipolar depression.

### What is a "mood stabilizer"? An evidence-based response [^116eJqr7]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

The term "mood stabilizer" is widely used in the context of treating bipolar disorder, but the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not officially recognize the term, and no consensus definition is accepted among investigators. The authors propose a "two-by-two" definition by which an agent is considered a mood stabilizer if it has efficacy in treating acute manic and depressive symptoms and in prophylaxis of manic and depressive symptoms in bipolar disorder. They review the literature on the efficacy of agents in any of these four roles to determine which if any agents meet this definition of mood stabilizer.

Method

The authors conducted a comprehensive review of English-language literature describing peer-reviewed, U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality class A controlled trials in order to identify agents with efficacy in any of the four roles included in their definition of a mood stabilizer. The trials were classified as positive or negative on the basis of primary outcome variables. An "FDA-like" criterion of at least two positive placebo-controlled trials was required to consider an agent efficacious. The authors also conducted a sensitivity analysis by raising and relaxing the criteria for including trials in the review.

Results

The authors identified 551 candidate articles, yielding 111 class A trials, including 81 monotherapy trials with 95 independent analyses published through June 2002. Lithium, valproate, and olanzapine had unequivocal evidence for efficacy in acute manic episodes, lithium in acute depressive episodes and in prophylaxis of mania and depression, and lamotrigine in prophylaxis (relapse polarity unspecified). Thus, only lithium fulfilled the a priori definition of a mood stabilizer. Relaxing the quality criterion did not change this finding, while raising the threshold resulted in no agents fulfilling the definition.

Conclusions

When all four treatment roles are considered, the evidence supported a role for lithium as first-line agent for treatment of bipolar disorder. The analysis also highlights unmet needs and promising agents and provides a yardstick for evaluating new treatment strategies.
