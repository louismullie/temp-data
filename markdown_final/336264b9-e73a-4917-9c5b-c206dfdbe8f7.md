## Question

How to approach npo hypoglycemia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to approach hypoglycemia in patients who are NPO, with explicit stepwise thinking and self-verification language preserved and enhanced. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define and risk-stratify hypoglycemia in the NPO context. Then, I should verify immediate treatment protocols when the patient is NPO and cannot swallow. Next, I will examine insulin and glucose infusion adjustments to prevent recurrence. After that, I need to ensure appropriate monitoring cadence and transitions. Finally, I should review special populations, root-cause analysis, and quality improvement elements to close the loop on prevention and surveillance.

> Let me first confirm the definitions and risk stratification so I don't jump to conclusions: Level 1 hypoglycemia is glucose less than 70 mg/dL but at least 54 mg/dL, Level 2 is less than 54 mg/dL, and Level 3 is severe hypoglycemia with altered mental status requiring assistance. In the NPO setting, risk is amplified by absent enteral carbohydrates, insulin on board, renal or hepatic disease, and altered cognition, so I need to keep these in mind as I proceed [^1144zz5V].

> Wait, let me verify the immediate treatment when the patient is NPO and cannot take anything by mouth: for glucose 41–70 mg/dL, give half an ampule of D50W intravenously, and for glucose less than 40 mg/dL, give a full ampule of D50W. I should double-check that this aligns with nursing protocols and that rechecking glucose in 15 minutes and repeating if still under 70 mg/dL is standard, which it is in long-term care and hospital protocols, and I should also remember that if there is no IV access, intramuscular or intranasal glucagon is appropriate while securing access [^116MvaSr] [^115CzzYq] [^114QwuN3].

> Hold on, I should verify insulin adjustments to prevent recurrence once hypoglycemia is treated: for type 1 diabetes or insulin-dependent type 2 diabetes who are NPO, basal insulin should generally be continued to prevent ketosis, but prandial insulin must be held. If hypoglycemia occurs, I should reduce the total daily insulin dose by about 10–20% and consider adding dextrose-containing IV fluids such as D5W at 75–100 mL/hr to provide a glucose source while NPO, with close monitoring to titrate the rate. I need to ensure I'm not inadvertently stopping basal insulin in type 1 diabetes, which would risk DKA, and I should confirm that perioperative guidance supports continuing basal with prandial holds and dextrose support when needed [^117FyeHJ] [^113nkJDA] [^111xUSSf].

> I need to check the monitoring cadence because missing the nadir is a classic pitfall: for NPO patients on insulin, point-of-care glucose should be checked every 4–6 hours at minimum, and after a hypoglycemic event I should increase to every 1–2 hours until three consecutive values are in range, then de-escalate. If continuous glucose monitoring is available and the patient is high risk, I should continue or initiate CGM with periodic POC confirmation in a hybrid approach, recognizing inpatient CGM is under enforcement discretion and not FDA-cleared for dosing, so POC remains the reference standard for treatment decisions [^115ijXqa] [^114y7fxT] [^112iYrJU].

> Let me consider special populations so I don't overgeneralize: in type 1 diabetes, I must maintain basal insulin and provide dextrose when NPO to avoid DKA. In pregnancy, basal rates or doses should be reduced by about 25–50% pre-procedurally when NPO and dextrose may be added to maintenance fluids. In renal or hepatic failure, insulin clearance is reduced, so I should lower doses and monitor more frequently. In older adults, I should deintensify regimens and individualize targets to reduce hypoglycemia risk. For patients with hypoglycemia unawareness, I should set higher premeal targets temporarily and intensify surveillance [^117FyeHJ] [^1119moti] [^112LCtkB] [^115pXrxW].

> Next, I should review root-cause analysis and prevention so this episode informs future care: I need to document the exact glucose value, symptoms, timing relative to insulin, nutritional status, and contributing medications. I should verify whether insulin was given without carbohydrates, whether dextrose infusions were interrupted, and whether oral hypoglycemics like sulfonylureas were continued. Then I should adjust the regimen, consider dextrose infusion while NPO, and ensure the hypoglycemia prevention plan is communicated at handoffs. Institutional surveillance and EHR-based alerts can support timely dose adjustments and reduce recurrence [^112792Rc] [^111Tzuez] [^1144zz5V].

> But wait, what if the patient is on an insulin pump or receiving continuous insulin infusion? I should confirm pump continuation policies and infusion protocols: many centers allow continuation of personal pumps with close monitoring, and for IV insulin, validated algorithms require frequent glucose checks and careful coordination with nutrition. Importantly, when transitioning off IV insulin, I need to give the first subcutaneous basal dose 1–2 hours before stopping the infusion to avoid a gap in coverage, and I should double-check that the transition dose is typically based on a percentage of the prior 24-hour infusion requirement [^113N3AbV] [^116vtoub].

> I should double-check that my treatment and prevention steps align with major guidelines: ADA 2025 supports glucose as first-line for conscious hypoglycemia, repeat in 15 minutes, and structured hypoglycemia surveillance in the hospital. AACE recommends glucagon when oral carbs are not feasible and emphasizes education and regimen review. The Endocrine Society supports inpatient CGM for high-risk patients with a hybrid approach and highlights structured education to reduce hypoglycemia risk [^116MvaSr] [^115pXrxW] [^111TCaaR].

> In summary, I need to ensure a disciplined sequence: treat severe hypoglycemia immediately with IV dextrose or glucagon, reassess in 15 minutes and repeat until over 70 mg/dL. Continue basal insulin for type 1 diabetes while holding prandial doses when NPO. Add dextrose infusion to provide substrate. Reduce total daily insulin by 10–20% after an episode. Monitor every 4–6 hours routinely and every 1–2 hours after hypoglycemia until stable. Tailor for special populations. And perform root-cause analysis with documentation and system-level prevention to close the loop and reduce recurrence [^116MvaSr] [^117FyeHJ] [^115ijXqa] [^112792Rc].

NPO hypoglycemia is best managed by **IV dextrose for severe cases** and **dextrose-containing fluids for prevention** [^115CzzYq] [^117FyeHJ]. Use **D50W 25 g IV push** for severe hypoglycemia, then D5W or D10W infusions to maintain glucose > 70 mg/dL [^115CzzYq] [^114GQUpj] [^117FyeHJ] [^116MvaSr]. Monitor glucose every 1–2 hours initially, then every 4–6 hours once stable [^115ijXqa]. Adjust insulin by holding prandial doses, reducing basal by 50% if NPO all day, and continuing basal for type 1 diabetes to prevent DKA [^117FyeHJ]. Identify and treat causes, and use standardized protocols to reduce recurrence [^112792Rc] [^113nkJDA].

## Immediate management of NPO hypoglycemia

### Severe hypoglycemia (glucose < 40 mg/dL or altered mental status)

- **IV dextrose**: Administer 25 g IV dextrose (50 mL of 50% dextrose solution, D50W) over 1–3 minutes [^115CzzYq].

- **Glucagon**: If IV access is unavailable, administer 1 mg glucagon IM or intranasally; repeat once after 15 minutes if needed [^115pXrxW].

- **Monitoring**: Recheck glucose every 15 minutes until stable, then every 1–2 hours initially [^111nM22C].

---

### Mild to moderate hypoglycemia (glucose 40–70 mg/dL)

For mild to moderate hypoglycemia (glucose 40–70 mg/dL), use **IV dextrose** — 10 g IV dextrose (100 mL of 10% dextrose solution, D10W) over 1–2 minutes — or **dextrose infusion** with D5W or D10W at 50–100 mL/hour to maintain glucose > 70 mg/dL [^117FyeHJ]. Recheck glucose every 15 minutes until stable, then every 1–2 hours initially [^111nM22C].

---

## Preventive strategies for NPO hypoglycemia

### Insulin regimen adjustments

- **Basal insulin**: Continue basal insulin in type 1 diabetes to prevent DKA; reduce basal dose by 50% if NPO all day [^117UAQGT].

- **Prandial insulin**: Hold prandial insulin when NPO [^117UAQGT].

- **Correction insulin**: Use conservative correction insulin dosing based on frequent glucose monitoring [^115ijXqa].

---

### Dextrose-containing intravenous fluids

Use **D5W infusion** at 50–100 mL/hour for NPO patients at risk of hypoglycemia, and **D10W infusion** for patients with higher insulin requirements or recurrent hypoglycemia [^notfound].

---

### Frequent glucose monitoring

Initially, **monitor glucose every 1–2 hours** until stable, then every 4–6 hours [^115ijXqa]. Use **continuous glucose monitoring (CGM)** for high-risk patients when available [^111TCaaR].

---

## Identification and management of underlying causes

Common causes of NPO hypoglycemia include **excessive insulin dosing**, **inadequate dextrose supplementation**, **renal or hepatic impairment**, and **altered nutritional intake**. Management includes reviewing and adjusting insulin regimens, ensuring adequate dextrose supplementation, evaluating renal and hepatic function, and coordinating with nutrition services to optimize caloric intake.

---

## Role of standardized protocols and clinical decision support systems

Standardized protocols and clinical decision support systems (CDSS) reduce hypoglycemia by guiding insulin dosing, glucose monitoring, and dextrose administration. They also enable **early detection** of at-risk patients and prompt intervention [^111Tzuez].

---

## Special considerations

- **Type 1 diabetes**: Never discontinue basal insulin; provide dextrose-containing fluids to prevent DKA [^117FyeHJ].

- **Renal or hepatic impairment**: Reduce insulin doses and monitor glucose more frequently [^114Z8zdE].

- **Elderly patients**: Use conservative insulin dosing and frequent monitoring due to higher hypoglycemia risk [^112LCtkB].

Decision and implementation considerations for inpatient programs: The panel members determined that this recommendation addressed a high-priority problem — that of inpatient hypoglycemia, and noted that hypoglycemia is dangerous and costly as well as associated with significant adverse outcomes and increased hospital length of stay (LOS) with poor recovery and increased mortality. The panel noted that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS) will include hypoglycemia as a priority quality measure in the inpatient setting beginning in 2023, with potential financial penalties for institutions with excessive rates of hypoglycemia. The panel appreciated that the institution of glycemic surveillance and management programs can be very costly with high resource requirements, that staff training can be very time-intensive and repeated education is required, and that for such a program to work well there must be integration between glucometers, the main laboratory, and the EHRs so that daily reports can be easily created and made available to hospital staff.

In order to prevent inadequate repetition of gaps in care, in the design of this tool we considered time required for decision making and to observe effects of management changes applicable to routine clinical practice. These messages corresponding to gaps in care were presented in the EMR as synchronous alerts when providers were in the record of corresponding patients in real time. This design presented the information in a way that intended to facilitate learning about the gap in care scenarios and their management while situated in the context of clinical practice.

Process of validation and implementation in clinical practice

Findings of a previous qualitative needs assessment study using semistructured interviews of clinicians denoted their interest in having support for glucose management in the hospital using information technology. The perspectives of inpatient providers ratified a need of clinicians, and endorsed the development of the CDS tool and its implementation program. Prior to the integration of the tool in the clinical EMR environment, we conducted an exhaustive authentication process. This consisted in direct chart audits for accuracy verification of algorithmic workflows enabling cases detection. This assessment of precision reaffirmed the expected reliability of the tool. We conducted random audits during each ON and OFF periods of the study demonstrating complete alignment between design and product. Prior to the introduction of this CDS tool to hospital clinical practice, the program was endorsed by the hospital's chief medical office. In order to inform hospital providers of this new practice resources, we carried a communication agenda of in-person informational sessions to inpatient clinical services and email announcements by the study lead (APL).

Hypoglycemia risk factors

A total of 131 (53%) patients with hypoglycemia had a glomerular filtration rate < 60 mL/min at time of the hypoglycemic episode, 97 patients (43%) had poor oral intake or were nil per os (NPO) at some point during the admission, other risk factors and concomitant medications are described in table 2. Patients were treated in the hospital with basal-bolus insulin regimen, basal plus correctional insulin per sliding scale (SSI), or combination of insulin and oral agents, or with sliding-insulin scale alone (table 1).

In multivariate analysis for predictors of asymptomatic hypoglycemia including age, gender, renal function, blood glucose, BMI and HbA1c value, we found that older age and male gender were independent predictors of asymptomatic hypoglycemia, with men having two times higher odds than women (OR 2.08, CI 1.13 to 3.83, p = 0.02) (table 4). These relationships were independent of glucose levels at the time of the indexed event. In multivariate analysis adjusted for age, gender, renal function, LOS, and race, we found no significant association between a composite of complications and asymptomatic hypoglycemia (p = 0.7).

### Sitagliptin for the prevention of stress hyperglycemia in patients without diabetes undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery [^1155vSA4]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2019). High credibility.

Clinical guidelines from professional organizations recommend the use of insulin to manage stress hyperglycemia in cardiac surgery patients. Although effective in improving glycemic control, its use is labor intensive and is associated with higher risk of hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia after cardiac surgery, as hyperglycemia, has been found to be an independent factor for increased risk of complications, longer length of hospital stay, and increased mortality. The increased risk of iatrogenic hypoglycemia with insulin therapy has triggered the search of alternative approaches and treatment regimens. Recently, several randomized controlled studies have reported that the treatment with DPP-4 inhibitors results in similar improvement in glycemic control than insulin therapy, but with lower risk of hypoglycemia, in non-critically ill hospitalized patients with type 2 diabetes and mild to moderate hyperglycemia. Thus, we tested if stress hyperglycemia could be prevented with the use of a DPP-4 inhibitor, which could facilitate the management of patients after cardiac surgery. Unfortunately, our results indicate that treatment with sitagliptin was unsuccessful in preventing stress hyperglycemia after cardiac surgery. Among several causes, it could be possible that the time of administration of sitagliptin (24 hours prior to surgery) was not early enough to prevent stress hyperglycemia. One potential explanation could be that patients were kept NPO (Nil per Os) during the perioperative period. Native glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is secreted in response to food intake, thus perhaps inhibition of the DPP-4 enzyme may not necessarily lead to a significant increase of circulating GLP-1 in these patients as compared with patients who are tolerating oral intake. We could also speculate that the glycemic lowering effect of sitagliptin, an oral DPP-4 inhibitor, may not be potent enough to compensate for the stress hyperglycemic response. It is possible that the perioperative use of GLP-1 could achieve better glycemic control avoiding the need for insulin therapy after surgery. We did observe lower insulin dose requirements and duration of insulin infusion among patients with hyperglycemia exposed to sitagliptin, which may shorten ICU stay for a patient and decrease the nursing effort spent on glycemic control.

### Novel automated self-adjusting subcutaneous insulin algorithm improves glycemic control and physician efficiency in hospitalized patients [^113AcBAB]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Hyperglycemia occurs in 22% to 46% of hospitalized patients, negatively affecting patient outcomes, including mortality, inpatient complications, length of stay, and hospital costs. Achieving inpatient glycemic control is challenging due to inconsistent caloric intake, changes from home medications, a catabolic state in the setting of acute illness, consequences of acute inflammation, intercurrent infection, and limitations in labor-intensive glucose monitoring and insulin administration.

Method

We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional analysis at the University of California San Francisco hospitals between September 3, 2020 and September 2, 2021, comparing point-of-care glucose measurements in patients on nil per os (NPO), continuous total parenteral nutrition, or continuous tube feeding assigned to our novel automated self-adjusting subcutaneous insulin algorithm (SQIA) or conventional, physician-driven insulin dosing. We also evaluated physician efficiency by tracking the number of insulin orders placed or modified.

Results

The proportion of glucose in range (70–180 mg/dL) was higher in the SQIA group than in the conventional group (71.0% vs 69.0%, P = 0.153). The SQIA led to a lower proportion of severe hyperglycemia (> 250 mg/dL; 5.8% vs 7.2%, P = 0.017), hypoglycemia (54–69 mg/dL; 0.8% vs 1.2%, P = 0.029), and severe hypoglycemia (< 54 mg/dL; 0.3% vs 0.5%, P = 0.076) events. The number of orders a physician had to place while a patient was on the SQIA was reduced by a factor of more than 12, when compared with while a patient was on conventional insulin dosing.

Conclusions

The SQIA reduced severe hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia, and severe hypoglycemia compared with conventional insulin dosing. It also improved physician efficiency by reducing the number of order modifications a physician had to place.

ii. Intravenous insulin infusion.

The only method of insulin delivery specifically developed for use in the hospital is continuous intravenous infusion, using regular crystalline insulin. There is no advantage to using rapid acting analogs, whose structural modifications increase the rate of absorption from subcutaneous depots, in an intravenous insulin infusion. The medical literature supports the use of intravenous insulin infusion in preference to the subcutaneous route of insulin administration for several clinical indications among nonpregnant adults. These include DKA and nonketotic hyperosmolar state; general preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative care; the postoperative period following heart surgery; following organ transplantation; with cardiogenic shock; exacerbated hyperglycemia during high-dose glucocorticoid therapy; type 1 patients who are NPO; or in critical care illness in general. It may be used as a dose-finding strategy in anticipation of initiation or reinitiation of subcutaneous insulin therapy in type 1 or type 2 diabetes.

Many institutions use insulin infusion algorithms that can be implemented by nursing staff. Although numerous algorithms have been published, there have been no head-to-head comparisons between insulin infusion strategies. Algorithms should incorporate the concepts that maintenance requirements differ between patients and change over the course of treatment. Ideally, intravenous insulin algorithms should consider both current and previous glucose levels, the rate of change of plasma glucose, and the current intravenous insulin infusion rate. For all algorithms, frequent (Q 1–2 h) bedside glucose testing is required.

iii. Transition from intravenous to subcutaneous insulin therapy.

For those who will require subcutaneous insulin, the very short half-life of intravenous insulin necessitates administering the first dose of subcutaneous insulin before discontinuation of the intravenous insulin infusion. If short or rapid-acting insulin is used, it should be injected 1–2 h before stopping the infusion. If intermediate- or long-acting insulin is used alone, it should be injected 2–3 h before. A combination of short/rapid- and intermediate/long-acting insulin is usually preferred. Basal insulin therapy can be initiated at any time of the day and should not be withheld to await a specific dosing time, such as bedtime. A recent clinical trial demonstrated that a regimen using 80% of the intravenous insulin requirement over the preceding 24 h, divided into basal and bolus insulin components, was effective at achieving blood glucose levels between 80 and 150 mg/dl following discontinuation of the intravenous insulin.

In this new software system, glycemic targets were defined according to ACE/ADA guidelines. Average BG between 100 and 140 mg/dL was defined as target for the non-critically ill-patients BG control.

The category dose insulin was defined to become easier to remind the total daily dose of insulin (TDDI). The standard TDDI was 0.4 units/kg and was defined as insulin dose category number ´8´. One category could be increased or decreased by 0.05 units/kg, according to modifier factors described ahead. A lower category dose was considered for patients at risk of hypoglycemia, such as elderly patients or those with renal or liver impairment. Higher dose was considered for patients with higher insulin resistance, such as obese patients or those in use of high dose of corticosteroids. Every modifier factor could affect the insulin dose category independently and the final category was defined according to their combination. BG testing was recommended before meals and at bedtime in patients who were eating, or every 6 h in patients who were receiving nothing by mouth (nil per os — NPO) or receiving continuous enteral feeding (Fig. 1).

### Scientific advisory on nocturnal hypoglycemia in insulin-treated patients with diabetes: recommendations from Indian experts [^114bLzFW]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Insulin is one of the commonly prescribed glucose lowering agents in diabetes. Hypoglycemia is the most common complication, and severe hypoglycemia is the most serious complication of insulin therapy. Almost half of all severe hypoglycemia episodes (HEs) occur at night. However, patients are often unaware of their nocturnal hypoglycaemia (NH) risk. Additionally, both healthcare professionals and patients find it difficult to manage NH. The purpose of this expert group meeting is to improve NH awareness and provide guidance for the physicians to recognize and manage NH.

Method

The panel of experts in an e-board deliberated extensively upon the available literature and guidelines on hypoglycemia and NH discussed the consensus on definition, detection, reporting, monitoring, treatment, and optimization of therapy in NH.

Result

& Conclusion: Though there are many guidelines on the management of HEs in patients with diabetes, very few touch the topic of NH. This scientific advisory on management of NH in insulin treated patients with diabetes is formulated to address this gap in understanding regarding management of NH.

Diabetes hypoglycemia management — For measured glucose < 70 mg/dL [3.9 mmol/L] in persons able to safely swallow, fast-acting carbohydrates followed by complex carbohydrates should be used, and glucagon should be used to correct hypoglycemia if individuals are unable or unwilling to ingest carbohydrates orally; if there is no response after 15 min, an additional same dose may be administered. Persons with severe hypoglycemia with altered mental status or with profound hypoglycemia need to be hospitalized, persons treated with alpha-glucosidase inhibitors must be given oral glucose or lactose-containing foods, and persons at risk for hypoglycemia should perform frequent blood glucose monitoring (BGM) or preferably use continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices.

### Quality gaps in screening and monitoring for postoperative hyperglycemia in a Canadian hospital: a retrospective cohort study [^117L1bUc]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2021). High credibility.

Outcomes

Outcomes were defined using the perioperative glycemic process map developed with input from endocrinologists, perioperative internists, surgeons, data analysts, and quality improvement experts (figure 1). Measures are reported separately for patients with and without diabetes, and are stratified into screening measures, perioperative monitoring measures, perioperative glycemic outcome measures, and balancing measures. All measures are reported for the first 24 hours after surgery, which is based on previous work that suggests this is the most critical time period for development of adverse postoperative complications due to hyperglycemia. We defined in-target point-of-care capillary glucose measurement using the Diabetes Canada target as between 4.0 and 10.0 mmol/L. We measured the proportion of high-risk patients who underwent preoperative HbA1c measurement within the year prior to surgery or during the surgical admission. Monitoring for postoperative hyperglycemia was based on the number of POCT measurements in the first 24 hours after surgery. There are no major society guideline recommendations on the optimal number of POCT measurements after surgery, but our institutional policies recommend four times per day for patients using insulin or with diabetes and fasting.

Outcome measures included the proportion of POCT per patient that were in target, and number of patients with moderate (one or more POCT results between 14.0 and 17.9 mmol/L) or severe hyperglycemia (one or more POCT results > 18.0 mmol/L), considering only patients who had at least one POCT measurement. The balancing measure was the number of patients who experienced a hypoglycemic episode (one or more POCT results < 4.0 mmol/L).

Patients were categorized as having received a sliding scale insulin regimen (also called variable dose subcutaneous insulin regimen or correction-only dose insulin) if they received correction dose insulin alone without scheduled mealtime (if not nil per os (NPO)) or basal insulin for more than 65% of their inpatient stay. Patients were considered to have received a basal bolus insulin regimen if they received an ultra-long-acting, long-acting, or intermediate-acting insulin formulation and a scheduled mealtime insulin (if eating) dose for more than 65% of their inpatient stay. Intravenous insulin is only used during metabolic decompensation or in critical care units in our hospital and is not routinely used for the perioperative setting. Length of hospital stay in days was extracted from the EHR.

### EADSG guidelines: insulin therapy in diabetes [^111xUSSf]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Treatment for Non-critically Ill Patients

Insulin is the preferred treatment for glycemic control in critically ill patients. For non-critically ill patients with good nutritional intake basal, meal-related, and correction insulin dose are preferred. Subcutaneous rapid- or short-acting insulin before meals or every 4–6 h may be used in patients not on regular meals or in patients receiving continuous enteral/parenteral nutrition to correct hyperglycemia. For non-critically ill patients with poor oral intake or those who are taking nothing by mouth (NPO), basal insulin or a basal plus bolus correction insulin regimen is preferred. Basal-bolus is preferred over sliding scale insulin (SSI) owing to improved glycemic control and reduced hospital complications. Premixed insulin is preferred in the outpatient setting and basal-bolus therapy in the inpatient setting.

Recommendations

Consider using basal plus bolus correction insulin regimen, with the addition of meal-related insulin in patients who have good nutritional intake, in non-critically ill patients (Grade A, EL I)
Avoid sliding scale insulin in the inpatient hospital setting (Grade A, EL I)

Treatment for Critically Ill Patients

In the critically ill patients, continuous IV insulin is preferred. When the patient is able to take regular meals, basal and correction insulin doses are administered. When transitioning T1DM or T2DM patients to outpatient, SC insulin, SC basal insulin should be started 2–4 h before the IV insulin is discontinued.

Surgery

Perioperative Management

Perioperative management of blood glucose levels is based on the following objectives: (1) reduction in morbidity and mortality, (2) prevention of severe hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia, (3) maintenance of physiological electrolyte and fluid balance, (4) prevention of ketoacidosis, and (5) achieving the target glycemic levels less than 10 mmol/L in critical patients and less than 7.7 mmol/L in stable patients. Long-acting insulin (insulin glargine) should be discontinued 2–3 days prior to surgery and combination of intermediate-acting insulin (NPH) with short- or rapid-acting insulin twice daily or Regular insulin before meals and intermediate-acting insulin at bedtime used for glycemic control. Figure 6 shows the perioperative management in T1DM and T2DM patients.

Objective

The aim is to provide guidelines for the evaluation and management of adults with hypoglycemic disorders, including those with diabetes mellitus.

Evidence

Using the recommendations of the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system, the quality of evidence is graded very low (plus sign in circle ooo), low (plus sign in circle plus sign in circle oo), moderate (plus sign in circle plus sign in circle plus sign in circle o), or high (plus sign in circle plus sign in circle plus sign in circle plus sign in circle).

Conclusions

We recommend evaluation and management of hypoglycemia only in patients in whom Whipple's triad — symptoms, signs, or both consistent with hypoglycemia, a low plasma glucose concentration, and resolution of those symptoms or signs after the plasma glucose concentration is raised — is documented. In patients with hypoglycemia without diabetes mellitus, we recommend the following strategy. First, pursue clinical clues to potential hypoglycemic etiologies — drugs, critical illnesses, hormone deficiencies, nonislet cell tumors. In the absence of these causes, the differential diagnosis narrows to accidental, surreptitious, or even malicious hypoglycemia or endogenous hyperinsulinism. In patients suspected of having endogenous hyperinsulinism, measure plasma glucose, insulin, C-peptide, proinsulin, beta-hydroxybutyrate, and circulating oral hypoglycemic agents during an episode of hypoglycemia and measure insulin antibodies. Insulin or insulin secretagogue treatment of diabetes mellitus is the most common cause of hypoglycemia. We recommend the practice of hypoglycemia risk factor reduction — addressing the issue of hypoglycemia, applying the principles of intensive glycemic therapy, and considering both the conventional risk factors and those indicative of compromised defenses against falling plasma glucose concentrations — in persons with diabetes.

### Clinical characteristics of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus continued on oral antidiabetes medications in the hospital [^1178aRer]. Endocrine Practice (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective: Basal/basal-bolus insulin with discontinuation of home oral antidiabetes medications (OADs) is the preferred method to achieve glycemic control in many hospitalized patients. We hypothesized that a subset of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) can achieve an acceptable level of blood sugar control without cessation of their OADs when hospitalized. Methods: A retrospective chart review was conducted on patients with T2DM who were only on OADs at home, admitted to Fairview Hospital, a community hospital in the Cleveland Clinic Health System. We divided patients into those whose OADs were continued (group 1) and those whose OADs were discontinued (group 2), with or without the addition of insulin in the hospital. Blood glucose (BG) levels and patient characteristics were compared. Results: There were 175 patients, 73 in group 1 and 102 in group 2. The percentage of patients achieving all BG values within 100 to 180 mg/dL was the same between group 1 (21.9%) and group 2 (23.8%) (P = 0.78). Mean BG was similar between group 1 and group 2 (146.1 ± 41.4 mg/dL versus 152.1 ± 38.9 mg/dL; p = 0.33), with no significant difference in terms of percentage of patients with hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia. A greater proportion of patients in group 1 had an uninterrupted feeding status, nonintensive care unit admission and no contrast dye exposure, and a shorter length of stay. Conclusion: Our study shows that patients with certain characteristics could achieve an acceptable level of glycemic control without cessation of their home OADs. Abbreviations: BG = blood glucose; DPP-4 = dipeptidyl dipeptidase 4; GFR = glomerular filtration rate; HbA1c = hemoglobin A1c; ICU = intensive care unit; LOS = length of stay; NPO = nil per os; OAD = oral antidiabetes medication; POC = point of care; T2DM = type 2 diabetes mellitus.

### Peri-liver transplant hyperglycemia: mechanisms, associated factors, consequences, and management – A systematic review [^113K1747]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Based on existing protocols and studies, the authors of this article propose a protocol that will be detailed in a subsequent section. As shown in Figure 4, this proposed protocol is tailored to the clinical conditions of liver transplant recipients. It is essential to note that, due to the heightened risk of AKI and hypoglycaemia in liver transplant recipients, insulin dosing should be approached with greater caution than typically recommended in standard guidelines.

FIGURE 4
Suggested algorithm for glycemic control in liver transplant recipients; Abbreviations: BG: Blood glucose, DC: Discontinue, DKA: Diabetic ketoacidosis, EN: Enteral nutrition, GCs: Glucocorticoids, HHS: Hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic state, NEP: Norepinephrine, NPO: Nil per os, PN: Parenteral nutrition, PO: Per os, R/O: Rule out, TDD: Total daily dose.

According to the American Diabetes Association (ADA) guidelines, insulin therapy should be initiated in hospitalised patients with persistent hyperglycemia when blood glucose levels exceed 180 mg/dL on two occasions. Once therapy is initiated, a target glycemic range of 140–180 mg/dL is recommended for most critically ill patients with hyperglycemia. The Modified Yale protocol, with a blood glucose target of 140–180 mg/dL, provides guidelines for adjusting insulin infusion rates in liver transplant recipients. In critically ill liver transplant recipients, research is limited. Available studies have proposed the initiation and adjustment of insulin infusion according to their respective protocols, often with a lower target blood glucose range of 80–120 mg/dL.

Based on ADA guidelines, the aforementioned studies, and the clinical situations and risks associated with liver transplant recipients, the authors of this review recommend the following blood glucose management strategy. Continuous intravenous insulin infusion is initiated for certain liver transplant recipients in critical care settings, specifically those with severe hyperglycemia (blood glucose ≥ 250 mg/dL) after excluding hyperglycemic emergencies such as diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic shock. Also, in recipients with 180 ≤ blood glucose < 250 mg/dL and receiving high‐dose vasopressors (e.g. norepinephrine ≥ 30 μg/min), continuous intravenous insulin infusion is initiated because the efficacy of subcutaneous insulin is not reliable. It is suggested to consider a fixed dose of intermediate‐ or long‐acting insulin alongside intravenous insulin infusion to manage glucocorticoid‐induced hyperglycemia.

v. Hypoglycemia prevention.

Hypoglycemia, especially in insulin-treated patients, is the leading limiting factor in the glycemic management of type 1 and type 2 diabetes. In the hospital, multiple additional risk factors for hypoglycemia are present, even among patients who are neither "brittle" nor tightly controlled. Patients with or without diabetes may experience hypoglycemia in the hospital in association with altered nutritional state, heart failure, renal or liver disease, malignancy, infection, or sepsis. Additional triggering events leading to iatrogenic hypoglycemia include sudden reduction of corticosteroid dose, altered ability of the patient to self-report symptoms, reduction of oral intake, emesis, new NPO status, inappropriate timing of short- or rapid-acting insulin in relation to meals, reduction of rate of administration of intravenous dextrose, and unexpected interruption of enteral feedings or parenteral nutrition.

Despite the preventable nature of many inpatient episodes of hypoglycemia, institutions are more likely to have nursing protocols for the treatment of hypoglycemia than for its prevention. Tracking such episodes and analyzing their causes are important quality improvement activities.

3. Diabetes care providers in the hospital

Inpatient diabetes management may be effectively provided by primary care physicians, endocrinologists, or hospitalists. Involvement of appropriately trained specialists or specialty teams may reduce length of stay, improve glycemic control, and improve outcomes. In the care of diabetes, implementation of standardized order sets for scheduled and correction-dose insulin may reduce reliance on sliding-scale management. A team approach is needed to establish hospital pathways. To achieve glycemic targets associated with improved hospital outcomes, hospitals will need multidisciplinary support to develop protocols for subcutaneous insulin therapy that effectively and safely achieve glycemic targets.

### Approach to the hypoglycemic patient [^1167r6Yw]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Hypoglycemia is commonly encountered in the emergency department. Patients can present with a myriad of symptoms and its presentation can mimic other more serious diagnoses. Despite the relative ease of its management, clinicians often miss the diagnosis or mismanage it even when discovered. Glucose is an important energy source for the brain and failing to recognize hypoglycemia or mismanaging it can lead to permanent neurologic disability or death. Although it is important to replenish glucose in a rapid fashion, it is equally important to discover and manage the underlying etiology to prevent further episodes of hypoglycemia.

Hypoglycemia treatment in LTCFs

The best approach to minimize hypoglycemia is by preventing its occurrence in the first place. Most hypoglycemia episodes are preventable, and minimizing their duration and frequency has been proven to decrease mortality. Hospitals have implemented several strategies to decrease the occurrence of hypoglycemia such as reviewing patients' treatment regimen when BG is less than < 70 mg/dL. This includes monitoring glucocorticoids doses, activity level, oral intake, and enteral or parenteral feedings as well. Hospital protocols aim to evaluate root causes to address systemic issues when hypoglycemia occurs rather than treating it as a separate event. To improve synchronization of prandial insulin with mealtime, several strategies are executed in the hospital settings. Some methods include alerting the nurse of meals tray delivery by food staff or standardizing the food delivery schedules. A remote surveillance system that allows a diabetes specialist to make recommendations in the patient chart has also been tested. It demonstrated decrease in the hypoglycemia frequency and the approach was widely accepted. Furthermore, novel approaches are also being studied in hospitalized patients to predict hypoglycemia using machine learning or artificial intelligence embedded in the electronic medical record. Providers at LTCF could implement some of the strategies that are followed in the hospital, but quality improvement projects and research trials are needed to explore the full effects in such environments.

All hospitals and long-term facilities have instituted a hypoglycemia treatment protocol. These are usually executed by nurses when blood glucose falls below 70 mg/dL and providers are ought to alter the diabetes management regimen to decrease the risk of further severe and very severe hypoglycemia. If the patient is able to swallow or has an oral access using gastric or nasogastric tubes, 15 g of carbohydrate should be administered. This equals 4 oz of juices or regular soda, 8 oz of skim milk, or one instant glucose of 31 g tube. If the patient is not able or allowed (nil per os (NPO)) to swallow, a half of dextrose 50 ampule should be given intravenousy for a BG between 41 mg/dL and 70 mg/dL, or a full ampule when blood glucose is less than 40 mg/dL. In both cases, blood glucose should be rechecked in 15 min and the approach can be repeated if glucose remains less than 70 mg /dL. Once hypoglycemia is resolved (> 70/mg/dL), the treatment plan should be examined carefully for any possible contributors such as the presence of glucose-lowering medications (eg, SUs) or higher than needed insulin dosage.

Model parameters

Table 2 shows the fully adjusted models with ORs, coefficients, and intercepts. The univariate associations for each predictor are shown in online supplementary table S2. For biochemical hypoglycemia, there were a total of 3935 events and 44 variables in the model, with an event per variable (EPV) ratio of 89. For clinically significant hypoglycemia, there were a total of 1081 events and 35 variables, with an EPV ratio of 30.9. Thus, both models exceeded the recommended EPV of 10 or more.

Table 2
Logistic regression models with ORs and coefficients from validation data sets

Predictors associated with reduced risk of hypoglycemia in one or both models included female sex, increasing age over 40 years, admission to surgical service, higher weight, higher index day mean and nadir BG, higher admission nadir BG, non-NPO diet, liver disease, and steroid use. Predictors associated with increased risk of hypoglycemia in one or both models included increasing basal insulin doses (in range of ≤ 0.8 units/kg), increasing nutritional insulin doses (in range of ≤ 0.6 units/kg), use of high-dose SSI, higher index day and admission CV BG, NPO diet, type 1 diabetes/pancreatectomy, type 2 diabetes, CKD, and digestive diseases.

There was significantly lower total insulin use in surgical compared with medical patients, with median (IQR) doses of 0.07 (0.02–0.24) and 0.14 (0.04–0.38) unit/kg/day, respectively (P < 0.001). Lower insulin doses in surgical patients may have been related to higher prevalence of NPO status in this group: 54.8% of index days were NPO in surgery patients compared with 45.2% in medical patients (P < 0.001).

Glycemic measures were the strongest predictors of hypoglycemia risk. For example, in model 1, for each 10 mg/dL increase in index day mean BG, the reductions in the adjusted odds of hypoglycemia were 27%, 14%, and 1% in the ranges of BG of ≤ 100 mg/dL, > 100 and ≤ 150 mg/dL, and > 150 mg/dL, respectively. Similarly, each 10% increase in the admission CV BG beyond 18% was associated with a 19% increase in the adjusted odds of hypoglycemia.

Online supplementary tables S3 and S4 provide an explanation on how to use each model to calculate prediction for an individual patient-day using mock case examples.

### Prevention and management of insulin-associated hypoglycemia in hospitalized patients [^113nkJDA]. Endocrine Practice (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether appropriate therapeutic changes in insulin doses are made to prevent and manage insulin-associated hypoglycemic events in non-critically ill hospitalized patients.

Methods

This retrospective study was conducted in hospitalized adults on medical or surgical floors with insulin-associated hypoglycemia, excluding treatment with insulin infusions, insulin pumps, and parenteral nutrition. The first hypoglycemic event after 48 hours of admission was the index event. Over the 1-year study period, a total of 457 insulin-associated hypoglycemic events were included as index events.

Results

An indication for an insulin dose adjustment was identified in 32 and 42% of patients on day -2 and day -1, respectively, before the index hypoglycemic event, of which 35 and 55%, respectively, had an insulin dose reduction ≥ 10%. Following the hypoglycemic event, 44% of patients had an insulin dose reduction of ≥ 20%. Therapeutic reduction of the total daily insulin dose by ≥ 20% was associated with increased odds of normoglycemia and lower odds of hyperglycemia but was not associated with lower odds of recurrent hypoglycemia on the day following the index hypoglycemic event. There was a high prevalence of hypoglycemic risk factors in this population, with kidney disease and nil per os status being the most prevalent contributing factors.

Conclusion

Adherence to the current practice recommendation to reduce insulin doses in patients with borderline hypoglycemia and following overt hypoglycemia was modest. Further studies are needed to understand the associated risks and to define appropriate therapeutic changes for insulin treated patients with borderline and overt hypoglycemia.

### Diabetes mellitus in pregnancy: implications for obstetric anesthesia [^1134DJYG]. Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Because pregnant patients so commonly can present with euglycemia, the most common mistake we see is for providers to not initiate insulin therapy quickly enough or at sufficient levels upon recognition of DKA in pregnancy. It is important to realize that insulin must be given to inhibit ongoing synthesis of ketoacids and thereby correct acidosis. If a patient's serum glucose level is less than 200 mg/dl, an exogenous sugar source should be administered in the form of 5% dextrose added to maintenance fluids (as described above) to avoid hypoglycemia. If the patient is hyperglycemic, a continuous IV infusion of regular insulin is typically started at a rate of 0.1 U · kg –1 · h –1 after an initial bolus of 0.1 U/kg. The ongoing insulin rate is adjusted based on changes in serum glucose levels. Due to challenges with managing insulin in these individuals, we typically have them remain NPO until the anion gap metabolic acidosis is corrected. We also strongly recommend against allowing patients to continue to use any wearable subcutaneous insulin pumps during treatment of DKA while on an IV insulin infusion.

### Insulin analogs versus human insulin in the treatment of patients with diabetic ketoacidosis: a randomized controlled trial [^117UAQGT]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

After resolution of DKA, insulin infusion was discontinued 2 h after the administration of subcutaneous insulin. Patients with newly diagnosed diabetes received an initial total daily dose (TDD) of insulin of 0.6 unit · kg −1 · day −1. Subjects receiving insulin therapy before admission received the same outpatient insulin amount, with the TDD switched to glargine and glulisine or to NPH and regular insulin on a unit-for-unit basis.

Patients treated with subcutaneous glargine and glulisine received 50% of the TDD as glargine and 50% as glulisine insulin. Glargine was given once daily at the same time of day and glulisine was given in three equally divided doses before each meal. Glargine was given at the full dose independently of food intake, but to prevent hypoglycemia, the dose of glulisine was held if a subject was not able to eat a given meal. Patients treated with NPH and regular insulin received two-thirds of the TDD before breakfast and one-third of the TDD before dinner. The insulin dose was given as two-thirds NPH and one-third regular insulin in the morning with breakfast and two-thirds NPH and one-third regular insulin in the evening with dinner. To prevent hypoglycemia, regular insulin was held if a subject was not able to eat a given meal; in addition, the dose of NPH was reduced by 50% if a patient was kept NPO all day. Insulin dosage was adjusted daily according to glucose values to maintain target blood glucose < 140 mg/dl before meals. The insulin dose was adjusted, and supplemental insulin was given based on blood glucose levels (supplementary Table B, available in an online appendix).

The primary outcome of the study was the determination of differences in the rate of hypoglycemic events (blood glucose < 70 mg/dl) during the transition period between treatment groups. Secondary outcomes included differences in the time to resolution of DKA and hyperglycemia, average blood glucose during intravenous insulin infusion, mean daily blood glucose after resolution of DKA, length of hospital stay, and hospital complications between treatment groups.

To determine if, for inpatients with hyperglycemia who are NPO, on TF, or on TPN, an automated self-adjusting subcutaneous rapid acting insulin algorithm (SQIA) we developed and programmed into the EMR leads to improvements in glucose control compared to conventional insulin treatment (CI). Design/Intervention/Setting/PatientsRetrospective cohort study using EMR data from 9/3/2020 to 9/2/2023, of all adult inpatients, comparing point-of-care (POC) glucose measurements between patients on SQIA versus CI and either NPO, or on TF, or on TPN. The analysis looked at the proportion of q4 hour POC glucose levels in the following ranges: hypoglycemia (< 70 mg/dL), in range (71–180 mg/dL), moderate hyperglycemia (181–250 mg/dL), and severe hyperglycemia (> 250 mg/dL).

Results

There were 5,031 intervals (associated with 4310 hospitalizations) in which the patient was NPO or on TF or TPN and on the SQIA (73.5%) or CI (26.5%). The proportion of glucose values in the hypoglycemic and severely hyperglycemic ranges were significantly lower in the SQIA group vs. the CI group (hypoglycemia: 0.65% vs. 1.10%; difference -0.45%; -0.62 to -0.28%; p < 0.001; hyperglycemia: 5.40% vs. 6.65%; difference -1.25%; -2.03% to -0.46%; p = 0.002). With glucocorticoids, rates of severe hyperglycemia were lower for patients on the SQIA, particularly those receiving high-dose glucocorticoids (11.1% lower).

Conclusions

Patients had a lower proportion of both hypoglycemic and severely hyperglycemic measurements when their blood glucose levels were managed using the SQIA than when managed using conventional physician-driven insulin orders.

4. Self-management in the hospital

Self-management of diabetes in the hospital may be appropriate for competent adult patients who have a stable level of consciousness, have reasonably stable daily insulin requirements, successfully conduct self-management of diabetes at home, have physical skills needed to successfully self-administer insulin and perform SMBG, have adequate oral intake, and are proficient in carbohydrate counting, use of multiple daily insulin injections or insulin pump therapy, and sick-day management. The patient and physician, in consultation with nursing staff, must agree that patient self-management is appropriate under the conditions of hospitalization. For patients conducting self-management in the hospital, it is imperative that basal, prandial, and correction doses of insulin and results of bedside glucose monitoring be recorded as part of the patient's hospital medical record. While many institutions allow patients on insulin pumps to continue these devices in the hospital, others express concern regarding use of a device unfamiliar to staff, particularly in patients who are not able to manage their own pump therapy. If a patient is too ill to self-manage either multiple daily injections or CSII, then appropriate subcutaneous doses can be calculated on the basis of their basal and bolus insulin needs during hospitalization, with adjustments for changes in nutritional or metabolic status.

5. Preventing hypoglycemia

Hypoglycemia, especially in insulin-treated patients, is the leading limiting factor in the glycemic management of type 1 and type 2 diabetes. In the hospital, multiple additional risk factors for hypoglycemia are present, even among patients who are neither "brittle" nor tightly controlled. Patients with or without diabetes may experience hypoglycemia in the hospital in association with altered nutritional state, heart failure, renal or liver disease, malignancy, infection, or sepsis. Additional triggering events leading to iatrogenic hypoglycemia include sudden reduction of corticosteroid dose, altered ability of the patient to self-report symptoms, reduction of oral intake, emesis, new NPO status, inappropriate timing of short- or rapid-acting insulin in relation to meals, reduction of rate of administration of intravenous dextrose, and unexpected interruption of enteral feedings or parenteral nutrition.

Despite the preventable nature of many inpatient episodes of hypoglycemia, institutions are more likely to have nursing protocols for the treatment of hypoglycemia than for its prevention. Tracking such episodes and analyzing their causes are important quality improvement activities.

Brief report

Inpatient hyperglycemia is associated with adverse clinical outcomes in hospitalized patients, with or without known previous diabetes mellitus (DM), including prolonged hospital stay, infection, disability after hospital discharge, death and higher health care costs. Even in patients without DM, hyperglycemia may be an acute manifestation of critical and surgical illness that results from the metabolic and hormonal changes, in response to injury and stress.

The American College of Endocrinology (ACE) and the American Diabetes Association (ADA) Task Force on Inpatient Glycemic Control recommend fasting blood glucose (BG) level less than 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L) and a random BG level less than 180 mg/dL (10.0 mmol/L), without excess hypoglycemia, for the majority of non-critically ill patients treated with insulin. In order to avoid hypoglycemia, readjustments in the insulin regimen were considered if BG levels decline below 100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L). It was suggested for BG testing: before meals and at bedtime in patients who were eating, or every 4–6 h in patients who were receiving nothing by mouth (nil per os — nPO) or receiving continuous enteral feeding. Despite the fact that many studies have shown solid evidence in support of inpatient glycemic control, BG control remains deficient and overlooked.

Intrapartum Insulin Management

There are no rigorous data to inform guidelines or practice patterns regarding insulin management on the morning of scheduled births. For individuals planning a scheduled cesarean birth or other surgery, insulin dosing is typically reduced before the procedure due to standard NPO policies. We suggest that for patients taking multiple daily injections of insulin, basal dosing be reduced by 25 to 50% depending on the type of insulin. For those patients using wearable insulin pumps to administer insulin, we recommend decreasing the basal rate by 25% preoperatively on the morning of surgery and to further decrease it during the postpartum period. Table 4 includes a summary of recommended adjustments to basal insulin regimens before scheduled surgeries in pregnancy.

Table 4.
Adjustment to Basal Insulin Dosing for Patients Made NPO in Anticipation of a Scheduled Anesthetic

For individuals admitted for an induction of labor (where NPO policies are typically not as strict, and patients are typically allowed clear liquids throughout active labor), some practice reviews suggest that home insulin can simply be continued at usual dosing. However, we think basal insulin should routinely be decreased by 25%. This is because oral intake of glucose typically decreases during labor relative to usual, even as the metabolic stress of labor creates an increased need for circulating glucose.

QUESTION 4: DOES INPATIENT MANAGEMENT OF HYPERGLYCEMIA REPRESENT A SAFETY CONCERN?

Overtreatment and undertreatment of hyperglycemia represent major safety issues in hospitalized patients with and without diabetes. Fear of hypoglycemia, clinical inertia, and medical errors are major barriers to achieving optimal blood glucose control (,–). In most clinical situations, safe and reasonable glycemic control can be achieved with appropriate use of insulin, adjusted according to results of bedside glucose monitoring.

Clinical situations that increase the risk for hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia in the hospital include the following:
Changes in caloric or carbohydrate intake ("nothing by mouth" status, enteral nutrition, or parenteral nutrition)
Change in clinical status or medications (for example, corticosteroids or vasopressors)
Failure of the clinician to make adjustments to glycemic therapy based on daily BG patterns
Prolonged use of SSI as monotherapy
Poor coordination of BG testing and administration of insulin with meals
Poor communication during times of patient transfer to different care teams
Use of long-acting sulfonylureas in elderly patients and those with kidney or liver insufficiency
Errors in order writing and transcription

Hypoglycemia is a major safety concern with use of insulin and insulin secretagogues. Hypoglycemia can occur spontaneously in patients with sepsis orin patients who receive certain medications, including quinolone antibiotics and β-adrenergic agonists. Although not all hypoglycemic episodes are avoidable, the use of nurse-driven hypoglycemia treatment protocols that prompt early therapy for any BG levels < 70 mg/dl (< 3.9 mmol/l) can prevent deterioration of potentially mild events — for example, BG values of 60–69 mg/dl (3.3–3.8 mmol/l) — to more severe events — for example, BG concentrations < 40 mg/dl (< 2.2 mmol/l). Particular attention is required in high-risk patients, including those with malnutrition; advanced age; a history of severehypoglycemia; or autonomic, kidney, liver, or cardiac failure.

Clinical inertia can be defined as not adjusting glycemic therapy in response to persistently abnormal results on BG determination. Often, there is a lack of ownership for diabetes management, particularly in hospitalized patients admitted with a primary diagnosis other than diabetes. This inaction may be due in part to insufficient knowledge or confidence in diabetes management. Improvements in care can be achieved by ongoing education and training.

Until blood glucose levels stabilise, as indicated by three consecutive readings within the target range, patients receiving insulin infusion should have their blood glucose measured hourly. Once blood glucose levels have stabilised for 12 to 24 h, monitoring can be reduced to every 2 h. Thereafter, if there are no significant changes in nutritional intake or clinical conditions, blood glucose levels can be monitored every 4 h. However, if any of the following conditions occur — such as changes in insulin infusion rate, significant alterations in the clinical status, initiation or discontinuation of vasopressors, commencement or cessation of renal replacement therapy, or significant changes in nutritional intake — hourly blood glucose monitoring should be resumed until two to three consecutive readings fall within the target range. For critically ill patients, it is preferable to obtain blood glucose samples from indwelling vascular catheters. Blood glucose measurements using glucometers in these patients are unreliable and should be avoided whenever possible.

For inpatient management of hyperglycemia in noncritical care settings, a glycemic target range of 100–180 mg/dL is recommended. In patients receiving three main meals, blood glucose levels should be measured with a glucometer before each meal and at bedtime. For patients who are nil per os (NPO) or receiving enteral or parenteral nutrition, blood glucose levels should be measured with a glucometer every 4 to 6 h. If these patients regularly experience hypoglycemia, blood glucose levels should be monitored more frequently. Patients without a history of diabetes (HbA1c < 6.5%) who experience hyperglycemia during hospitalisation are considered to have stress‐induced or drug‐induced hyperglycemia.

Insulin is the preferred choice over oral antidiabetic agents for managing glucocorticoid‐induced hyperglycemia, particularly in significant hyperglycemia and severe illness. In liver transplant recipients, methylprednisolone is predominantly used for immunosuppression. Since methylprednisolone is an intermediate‐acting glucocorticoid, the most suitable insulin for managing hyperglycemia is an intermediate‐acting basal insulin, such as NPH insulin. Following liver transplantation, as the glucocorticoid dose is gradually reduced and calcineurin inhibitors are initiated alongside glucocorticoids within 1 to 5 days post‐transplant, the NPH insulin dose would be adjusted in accordance with the glucocorticoid dosage.

ABM Clinical Protocol #25 — preprocedural fasting for breastfed infants defines scope, minimum fasting aims, and safety context, stating this protocol will help define the minimum fasting requirements for breastfed infants and provide suggestions to avoid unnecessary fasting while improving the infant's safety and comfort during the required fasting periods; stated goals are to prevent pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents during anesthesia or sedation, prevent hypoglycemia intraoperatively and during the NPO period, prevent volume depletion and maximize hemodynamics, minimize stress or anxiety in the NPO infant, and support optimal breastfeeding of the dyad before and after the procedure. Both general anesthesia and moderate sedation require adherence to the same fasting guidelines, and per American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) guidance sedation and analgesia comprise a continuum of states ranging from minimal sedation (anxiolysis) through general anesthesia; for this protocol the term anesthesia is used to encompass the continuum of moderate sedation to general anesthesia. Mechanistically, upon initiation of sedation or induction of anesthesia, the gag and cough reflexes are inhibited, allowing residual stomach contents to regurgitate into the open larynx and cause aspiration of solid particulates and acidic gastric juices, which can then lead to pneumonitis or pneumonia; while the incidence of aspiration is low with proper fasting (where from 3 to 10 out of every 10,000 anesthetics performed on children), aspiration pneumonitis may necessitate mechanical ventilation and/or a prolonged hospital course, and infants with multiple co-morbidities are placed in a higher risk stratification by the ASA with a higher incidence of aspiration. Historically, all patients had to be NPO or nothing by mouth after midnight to avoid pulmonary aspiration syndrome, and the safest practice and most effective prevention of pulmonary aspiration is adherence to current fasting guidelines.

Discussion and conclusions

Obtaining a pre-operative glucose measurement prior to induction of general anesthesia is prudent in any diabetic patient. But the timing of this pre-operative glucose check is less clear-cut as it involves judgment based on multiple parameters such as recent prior glucose values, the types of medications given preoperatively for glycemic control and their timings, as well as NPO status. In this particular case our last glucose check was 0.5 h after administration of regular insulin or 1.5 h prior to anesthesia induction. Regular insulin has an onset of action of about 30 min and its duration peaks between 2 and 4 h after dosing. The patient received long-acting insulin glargine (Lantus) 6 h prior to surgery; though it does not really peak, its duration of action can be as long as 12–24 h. This, combined with the regular insulin, whose effect was still increasing at the time of induction, meant that the last pre-op check at 1.5 h prior to induction did not capture the nadir glucose trajectory. In hindsight, a pre-operative glucose measurement closer to induction would have been more reflective of the situation.

Sometime patients are scheduled to undergo anesthesia for an elective surgery at a given time but unforeseen developments delay the procedure by a few hours. In this case the hyperglycemia took hours to correct and this resulted in a morning scheduled surgery instead delayed to the afternoon. The unintended consequence of this was an extended NPO period which further contributed to poor glycemic control. Early-on in management, when the hyperglycemia was being aggressively corrected, a low-dose concurring infusion of D5W sugar could have benefited this patient by reducing the likelihood of hypoglycemia from over correction.

If we knew that the patient was hypoglycemic, we would have delayed induction and instead treated the hypoglycemia. However, the patient only started complaining of hypoglycemic symptoms on induction after we started infusing the anesthetic. The intra-operative glucose check immediately after induction was prompted because of inkling from what the patient verbally expressed on induction.

Hypoglycemia management in insulin-treated diabetes mellitus: For premeal hypoglycemia (glucose < 70 mg/dL), prandial insulin should be adjusted as follows — pre‑midday meal glucose < 70 mg/dL: decrease AM meal dose by 10% to 20%; pre‑evening meal glucose < 70 mg/dL: decrease pre‑midday meal dose by 10% to 20%; and bedtime glucose < 70 mg/dL: decrease pre‑evening meal dose by 10%. Persons with DM on insulin and their families/companions should be educated on the symptoms and treatment of hypoglycemia (< 70 mg/dL) and severe hypoglycemia (< 54 mg/dL); if a person can safely swallow, an oral source of glucose should be given, and for a person who is unresponsive or unable to take oral glucose, glucagon should be administered. Glucagon formulations require reconstitution before subcutaneous or intramuscular injection, but soluble glucagon and a glucagon analog, dasiglucagon, are available that do not require reconstitution and are ready for immediate injection, and intranasal glucagon also has been shown to be efficacious.

### Prandial insulin dosing using the carbohydrate counting technique in hospitalized patients with type 2 diabetes [^111UP2Yo]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Hypoglycemia was managed with a 10–20% reduction in prandial insulin, unless it occurred overnight, in which case, the basal insulin was reduced. Due to the occurrence of two subjects with a glucose < 2.2 mmol/L, an amendment was implemented partway into the study to manage more advanced hypoglycemia (< 2.8 mmol/L) with a 50% reduction in TDD. This amendment also allowed the provider to reduce the basal insulin up to 20% prior to a procedure for which the patient was NPO.

Capillary blood glucose checks were ordered before and 2 h after meals and at bedtime (7-point profiles) using the Accuchek Inform glucometer.

Patients at the study institution are typically able to customize meals with the assistance of a dietary technician by choosing from several options that fit within the diet ordered by the primary team. For this study, a "carbohydrate-controlled" diet was ordered for all patients. The actual content of this diet varies but also depends upon the calorie content ordered (for example, an 1,800-calorie diet consists of ∼45 g at breakfast and 65 g at lunch and dinner, but patients may choose to ask for supplemental items). Treatment satisfaction was measured at day 3 using the Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Inpatients (DTSQ-IP). Each item is scored on a 7-point scale (0 to 6). Item 17 was excluded because it referred to a diabetes inpatient specialist nurse, which was not a feature of this study.

### Safety and efficacy of continuous insulin infusion in noncritical care settings [^112zJnkN]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Continuous insulin infusion (CII) to manage hyperglycemia is the accepted standard of care in the intensive care unit (ICU); however, the safety and efficacy of CII in the non-ICU setting has not been determined.

Research Design and Methods

This is a retrospective analysis of 200 consecutive patients receiving CII while admitted to general medical-surgical units at Emory University Hospital. We evaluated clinical outcomes and rates of hyperglycemia (blood glucose [BG] > 200 mg/dL) and hypoglycemia (BG < 60 mg/dL) events during CII.

Results

A total of 200 patients (age 52 ± 16 years; male/female [M/F] 108/92) were admitted to general medicine (45%) or surgery (55%) services, 88.5% with history of diabetes and 41% treated with corticosteroids. The mean BG prior to and during the CII was 323 mg/dL and 170 mg/dL, respectively. Blood glucose of ≤ 150 mg/dL was the targeted goal in 85% of patients and 67% achieved a BG ≤ 150 mg/dL by hospital day 2. Hypoglycemia (BG < 60 mg/dL) occurred at least once in 22% of patients, and severe hypoglycemia (BG < 40 mg/dL) occurred in 5% of patients. Multivariate regression analyses showed that nutrition status during CII was associated with increased frequency of hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia. Compared to patients kept nil per os (NPO), oral intake during CII increased rates of hyperglycemic (P = 0.012) and hypoglycemic events (P = 0.035).

Conclusions

CII resulted in rapid and sustained glycemic control and a rate of hypoglycemic events similar to that reported in recent ICU trials. The rates of hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic events are significantly higher in patients allowed to eat during CII.

### Management of individuals with diabetes at high risk for hypoglycemia: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^114y7fxT]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

Endocrine Society hypoglycemia guideline — results outline scope and recommendation strengths: The panel agreed on 10 questions specific to hypoglycemia risk and prevention in people with diabetes for which 10 recommendations were made. The guideline includes conditional recommendations for use of real-time continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and algorithm-driven insulin pumps in people with type 1 diabetes (T1D), use of CGM for outpatients with type 2 diabetes at high risk for hypoglycemia, use of long-acting and rapid-acting insulin analogs, and initiation and continuation of CGM for select inpatient populations at high risk for hypoglycemia. Strong recommendations were made for structured diabetes education programs for those at high risk for hypoglycemia; use of glucagon preparations that do not require reconstitution versus those that do for managing severe outpatient hypoglycemia for adults and children; for children, use of real-time CGM for individuals with T1D receiving multiple daily injections; and the use of inpatient glycemic management programs leveraging electronic health record data to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia.

### Standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^113HavEv]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for diabetes mellitus type 1, more specifically with respect to management of hypoglycemia, ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to administer glucose as the preferred treatment of conscious patients with glucose < 70 mg/dL (< 3.9 mmol/L), although any form of glucose-containing carbohydrate may be used. Avoid using foods or beverages high in fat and/or protein for initial treatment of hypoglycemia. Repeat the treatment if hypoglycemia persists 15 minutes after initial administration.

Recommendation 5 — We suggest continuation of personal continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) in the inpatient setting with or without algorithm-driven insulin pump (ADIP) therapy rather than discontinuation. (2⊕OOO) This should be performed via a hybrid approach in which CGM use is combined with periodic point-of-care blood glucose (POC-BG) testing to validate the accuracy of CGM. Inpatient CGM use is not currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) but currently has enforcement discretion, and it has been used in hospitals recently with emergency use authorization during the COVID-19 pandemic.

### Development and validation of a prediction model for insulin-associated hypoglycemia in non-critically ill hospitalized adults [^111tyeAm]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2018). Medium credibility.

For most insulin-treated hospitalized patients on medical/surgical wards, BG measurements are typically obtained four times daily (before each meal and at bedtime) or every 4 hours if nil per os (NPO). We evaluated several glycemic measures as predictors of incident hypoglycemia. Mean BG and coefficient of variation of BG (CV BG) and nadir BG were summarized both on the index day and for all inpatient days up to and including the index day. Both index day and admission-level glycemic measures were evaluated as predictors.

Using relevant International Classification of Disease s (ICD-9) diagnostic codes, we generated categories of clinical conditions that could affect glucose regulation. We categorized type 1 diabetes mellitus and postsurgical hypoinsulinemia as insulin-deficient states. Without information about home insulin use, we could not identify patients with type 2 diabetes who were insulin-deficient. Acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) predispose to hypoglycemia via reduced insulin clearance and reduced gluconeogenesis. Liver failure causes hyperglycemia due to increased insulin resistanceand in decompensated failure may cause hypoglycemia due to reduced gluconeogenesis. Chronic alcohol use can cause hypoglycemia due to depletion of glycogen stores from prolonged fasting and inhibition of gluconeogenesis. We combined alcohol dependency and end-stage liver disease into a category of liver disease. Congestive heart failure is another less common hypoglycemic risk factor. Acute pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer have both been associated with hyperglycemia (ie, pancreatogenous diabetes). Given the low prevalence of each of these conditions, we combined them into one category. Steroids, which are commonly used in hospitalized patients, contribute to hyperglycemia via insulin resistance. We evaluated systemic steroid use as a binary predictor, but did not have information about steroid dose to evaluate the effect of steroid tapers on insulin requirements and hypoglycemia risk. Given the very low ICD coding for sepsis among diagnoses (0.07% of index days), sepsis was not included as a predictor in this non-critically ill population. Adrenal insufficiency is another known hypoglycemic risk factor; however, coding for this condition was virtually absent.

Reduced carbohydrate intake following insulin administration is a common cause of hypoglycemia. In addition to diet orders reflecting varying degrees of carbohydrate intake, we created a category of digestive diseases to include several conditions (nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, intestinal obstruction) that could influence carbohydrate intake. Although we considered using diagnostic codes associated with malnourishment (eg, failure to thrive, cachexia), coding for these conditions was exceedingly low.

### Near-miss hypoglycemia-reflections on perioperative glucose management guidelines in diabetics [^117FyeHJ]. BMC Anesthesiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Type 1 diabetics are completely dependent on the administration of exogenous insulin, fluid therapy, and glucose to prevent diabetic ketoacidosis. As a result, diabetic ketoacidosis is a particular concern in type 1 diabetics. Concurrent administration of insulin, glucose and potassium should be considered perioperatively until oral intake is resumed. When possible, intravenous glucose infusion and insulin therapy should be continued when a Type 1 diabetic is NPO. Recent NPO guidelines that allow clear liquids to be consumed up to two hours prior to surgery can assist preoperatively in avoiding and treating hypoglycemia.

Perioperative blood glucose management is not currently addressed by the ASA guidelines. Different approaches and recommendations exist. Regardless of the clinician's preference, vigilance is paramount in perioperative glucose management and patient specific judgment is particularly valuable in glucose management decisions

Recommendation 4 — inpatient continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) for high hypoglycemia risk: We suggest initiation of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) in the inpatient setting for select inpatients at high risk for hypoglycemia. (2⊕OOO). Background notes that intermittent point-of-care blood glucose (POC-BG) monitoring is time-consuming and not desirable to patients, whereas CGMs measure interstitial glucose levels every 1 to 5 minutes and have detected hypoglycemia missed by traditional POC-BG. Remarks specify a hybrid approach combining CGM with periodic POC-BG to validate accuracy, and state that inpatient CGM is not currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) but currently has enforcement discretion and has been used in hospitals with emergency use authorization during the COVID-19 pandemic.
