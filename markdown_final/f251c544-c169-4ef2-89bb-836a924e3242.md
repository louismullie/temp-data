## Question

What are common adverse effects of antipsychotic medications?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the common adverse effects of antipsychotic medications using the provided sources. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define and prioritize "common" versus "serious" adverse effects from the literature. Then, I should verify the main physiologic categories and extract representative examples. Next, I will consider drug-specific variability and risk stratification. After that, I need to check recommended monitoring and management strategies, including special populations. Finally, I will reconcile any apparent contradictions across sources and synthesize a clear, clinically useful summary [^112ocfn7] [^113XgCpt] [^116Go8Yw].

> Let me first confirm the scope and data structure I'm relying on: the documents consistently cluster adverse effects into metabolic/endocrine, movement disorders (EPS), prolactin/sexual, sedation/cognitive, cardiovascular, and anticholinergic domains; but hold on, I should verify which of these are truly "common" versus merely "serious" because frequency and clinical impact are not identical and can be drug-specific, so I need to be cautious not to overgeneralize across the entire class [^113XgCpt] [^112MuNdn].

> Wait, let me verify the "common" designation across sources before proceeding: multiple reviews and practice-focused papers consistently flag weight gain/metabolic changes, EPS (especially akathisia and parkinsonism), hyperprolactinemia/sexual dysfunction, and sedation as frequent and clinically consequential, while also noting hypotension and anticholinergic effects as notable tolerability issues; serious events like QT prolongation, torsades, NMS, agranulocytosis, and myocarditis are rarer but high-impact and must remain on the radar [^114vdAfT] [^114Trqvj] [^114QE5C7] [^113XgCpt].

> I will now examine metabolic effects because they are repeatedly emphasized: increased appetite, weight gain, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, and progression to metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes are well-documented with atypical antipsychotics, with mechanistic links spanning central and peripheral targets and clinically defined MetS criteria; I should confirm that guideline-consistent monitoring includes baseline and periodic weight, BMI, waist circumference, BP, fasting glucose, and lipids, as this directly mitigates risk and is repeatedly recommended [^112dL4bR] [^114S5X9C] [^111u4Cf5].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about movement disorders without distinguishing acute versus tardive syndromes: acute EPS encompasses parkinsonism, dystonia, and akathisia and remains common particularly with high D2 blockade, while tardive dyskinesia emerges with chronic exposure; management generally starts with dose reduction or switching to lower-EPS liability agents and using targeted treatments such as anticholinergics for parkinsonism/dystonia or beta-blockers/benzodiazepines for akathisia, while for TD a VMAT2 inhibitor is a recommended option; I should double-check that these strategies align with guideline statements [^111XS5dZ] [^11522qag] [^112b3t6v] [^114P2JYw] [^111xHqpt].

> Let me think about prolactin-related and sexual adverse effects next: dopamine blockade can elevate prolactin, leading to menstrual irregularities, galactorrhea, gynecomastia, decreased libido, erectile and orgasmic dysfunction, hypogonadism, and — over time — bone demineralization; I should confirm that recognition is often missed without direct inquiry and that management includes switching to lower-prolactin agents or addressing symptomatic hypogonadism when appropriate, and that some antipsychotics have lower propensity for prolactin elevation than others [^111dyEMQ] [^1153gHrT] [^114QE5C7] [^117CXxzL].

> Next, I should review sedation and cognitive effects: sedation is frequently cited as one of the most common and functionally impairing side effects, with impacts on daytime sleepiness, concentration, and motivation; but wait, I need to consider receptor-binding contributions such as H1 antagonism and remember that switching from a sedating to a less sedating agent can unmask rebound insomnia or activation, so tapering and cross-titration strategies should be planned to avoid withdrawal-emergent effects [^114Trqvj] [^114vdAfT] [^116qmwvK].

> I will now examine cardiovascular risks: I should confirm that QT prolongation with potential torsades and ventricular arrhythmias is a recognized class concern necessitating caution in patients with baseline risk or polypharmacy; hmm, wait a minute — mortality and cerebrovascular risk signals are nuanced, with meta-analyses assessing short-term serious adverse events and mortality showing low absolute event rates but requiring vigilance, whereas an older EFNS dementia guideline suggested atypicals do not confer greater stroke or mortality versus conventional agents, which may not fully reflect later risk syntheses or population differences, so I must present this carefully and contextually [^111XLFrV] [^1113ija4] [^1176qUsW] [^115Eyazv].

> I need to check anticholinergic and other notable effects to avoid omission: dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision, and cognitive blunting are clinically relevant and can be compounded by adjunctive anticholinergics used for EPS; orthostatic hypotension is also seen via alpha-1 blockade; for clozapine specifically, I should confirm life-threatening but rare events such as agranulocytosis and myocarditis, and not forget oral health consequences like xerostomia, dysgeusia, sialorrhea, and TD-related oral movement impacts that affect quality of life [^113XgCpt] [^114vdAfT] [^112T3bjC].

> But wait, what if the risk is highly drug-specific rather than class-wide — let me reconsider the stratification: large comparative analyses emphasize that antipsychotics differ more in side effects than in efficacy, with clozapine and olanzapine carrying higher metabolic risk on average and haloperidol showing higher EPS risk relative to many SGAs; I initially wrote "SGA agents, particularly clozapine and ol… " and then realized I must complete and clarify "olanzapine" as most associated with diabetes and progressive weight gain in observational syntheses, while ziprasidone appears more weight neutral; head-to-head FEP trials also show greater EPS with haloperidol compared to SGAs, reinforcing the need for individualized selection [^116Go8Yw] [^113xpgNK] [^111eyYnZ] [^11522qag].

> I should confirm core management principles now: if a benefit is clear and the effect is not life-threatening, start with dose reduction or schedule adjustment, then consider switching to a better-tolerated agent, and use targeted pharmacologic treatments when indicated; for metabolic risk, guidelines recommend lifestyle interventions and weight-management services, and I need to check the emerging consensus on metformin — co-prescribe metformin when early weight gain exceeds clinically relevant thresholds or when using high- or medium-risk agents in at-risk patients; for EPS, use anticholinergics for parkinsonism/dystonia and beta-blockers or benzodiazepines for akathisia, but avoid prophylactic antimuscarinics; for TD, consider a VMAT2 inhibitor [^113XgCpt] [^111u4Cf5] [^112axa8T] [^111mMxBF] [^1146EHFC] [^113jJpqe] [^111xHqpt] [^114P2JYw] [^112b3t6v].

> Hold on, I should verify special populations and settings: children and adolescents appear more vulnerable to weight gain, metabolic changes, prolactin elevation, sedation, and EPS, so careful baseline assessment and proactive monitoring are critical; in dementia-related psychosis/agitation, guidelines recommend discussing tapering and attempting discontinuation by approximately four months if feasible, owing to risk–benefit considerations; and with higher-risk agents like haloperidol or in frail populations, start low, titrate cautiously, and individualize dosing to tolerability [^111brCgP] [^112yaLy8] [^1113WtHS] [^113hWHC8] [^116Y5g94].

> Finally, I need to ensure my synthesis is clinically actionable: the most commonly encountered and functionally important adverse effects across antipsychotics include metabolic/weight gain, EPS (including akathisia), hyperprolactinemia/sexual dysfunction, sedation/cognitive slowing, and anticholinergic and cardiovascular effects, but their relative likelihood is drug-specific, so choice should be guided primarily by side-effect profiles, patient comorbidities, and patient preferences, with systematic monitoring and early intervention to mitigate risk and preserve adherence and outcomes [^115c7tx6] [^116Go8Yw].

Antipsychotics commonly cause **metabolic side effects** (weight gain, dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia, diabetes) [^112dL4bR] and **extrapyramidal symptoms** (parkinsonism, dystonia, akathisia, tardive dyskinesia) [^111XS5dZ]. Other common effects include sedation [^114Trqvj]; anticholinergic symptoms (dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision) [^112T3bjC]; hyperprolactinemia (galactorrhea, sexual dysfunction) [^114S5X9C]; cardiovascular effects (QT prolongation, orthostatic hypotension) [^111XLFrV]; and sexual dysfunction [^114QE5C7]. Overall, **risk varies by agent**: clozapine and olanzapine carry higher metabolic risk [^112dL4bR], whereas haloperidol carries a higher EPS risk [^111XS5dZ]. Regular monitoring and individualized management are essential to minimize adverse effects and improve adherence [^112ocfn7] [^115c7tx6] [^116Go8Yw].

---

## Metabolic side effects

**Metabolic disturbances** are among the most clinically significant adverse effects of antipsychotics, especially second-generation agents (SGAs) [^112dL4bR]. They include significant weight gain — most pronounced with clozapine and olanzapine and to a lesser extent with risperidone and quetiapine [^116Go8Yw] — dyslipidemia with elevated triglycerides and cholesterol that increase cardiovascular risk [^111eyYnZ], and hyperglycemia and diabetes due to insulin resistance, with increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus, especially with SGAs [^112dL4bR].

---

## Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS)

- **EPS** are movement disorders commonly associated with antipsychotics, especially first-generation agents (FGAs) [^1133GxDo] [^111XS5dZ]. These include:

- **Parkinsonism**: Characterized by tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia [^111XS5dZ].

- **Dystonia**: Involuntary muscle contractions causing abnormal postures [^113hfo6F].

- **Akathisia**: A subjective feeling of restlessness and an inability to sit still [^111XS5dZ] [^114P2JYw].

- **Tardive dyskinesia**: A potentially irreversible condition characterized by repetitive, involuntary movements, particularly of the face and tongue [^111XS5dZ] [^112kqSUA].

---

## Sedation and cognitive impairment

**Sedation** is a common side effect, particularly with agents that have antihistaminergic properties [^114Trqvj], and can significantly impair daily functioning, cognitive performance, and overall quality of life [^116Go8Yw].

---

## Anticholinergic side effects

Antipsychotics with **anticholinergic properties** can cause:

- **Dry mouth**: Xerostomia is a common complaint among patients [^112T3bjC].

- **Constipation**: A frequent and sometimes severe side effect [^113XgCpt].

- **Blurred vision**: Due to impaired accommodation [^112MuNdn].

- **Cognitive impairment**: Particularly in elderly patients [^113jJpqe].

---

## Hyperprolactinemia

**Hyperprolactinemia** — elevated prolactin levels — is a common side effect, particularly with FGAs and certain SGAs (e.g. risperidone) [^114S5X9C]. Clinical consequences include galactorrhea, gynecomastia, menstrual irregularities, and sexual dysfunction (decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, and infertility) [^111dyEMQ].

---

## Cardiovascular side effects

Antipsychotics are associated with several **cardiovascular side effects**, including QT prolongation with increased risk of torsades de pointes and sudden cardiac death [^111XLFrV], orthostatic hypotension with dizziness and fainting upon standing, and tachycardia [^1176qUsW].

---

## Sexual dysfunction

**Sexual dysfunction** is common and often underreported, including decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, delayed ejaculation, and anorgasmia [^114QE5C7] [^114s5hmu].

---

## Summary of common side effects by antipsychotic class [^116Go8Yw]

| **Side effect** | **First-generation antipsychotics (FGAs)** | **Second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs)** |
|-|-|-|
| Metabolic syndrome | Low | High (especially clozapine, olanzapine) |
| Extrapyramidal symptoms | High | Lower |
| Sedation | Moderate | High (especially quetiapine, olanzapine) |
| Anticholinergic effects | Moderate | Moderate |
| Hyperprolactinemia | High | Moderate (high with risperidone) |
| Cardiovascular effects | Moderate | Moderate |
| Sexual dysfunction | High | Moderate |

---

## Clinical management of side effects

Effective management of **antipsychotic side effects** includes:

- **Regular monitoring**: Weight, glucose, lipids, prolactin levels, and cardiovascular parameters [^112ocfn7] [^111u4Cf5].

- **Dose adjustment**: Lowering the dose or switching to another antipsychotic with a more favorable side effect profile [^112ocfn7] [^115c7tx6].

- **Adjunctive medications**: Use of anticholinergic medications for EPS, beta-blockers for akathisia, and metformin for metabolic side effects [^113XgCpt] [^111mMxBF].

- **Patient education**: Informing patients about potential side effects and encouraging adherence to treatment and monitoring protocols [^111yk7D7].

---

Antipsychotics are associated with a range of side effects — metabolic disturbances, extrapyramidal symptoms, sedation, anticholinergic effects, hyperprolactinemia, cardiovascular effects, and sexual dysfunction. The **risk and severity of these side effects vary** by specific medication and patient characteristics [^116Go8Yw].

### Prolactin-related and metabolic adverse effects of atypical antipsychotic agents [^114S5X9C]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

While there are many effective antipsychotics available to clinicians for treating schizophrenia or bipolar mania, the onset of antipsychotic-associated prolactin-related and metabolic adverse effects can diminish the effectiveness of treatment. Increased levels of prolactin (hyperprolactinemia) associated with some antipsychotics raise the risk of sexual side effects. The increased appetite and/or sedation (reduced activity levels) induced by other antipsychotics can lead to weight gain, dyslipidemia, and high blood pressure and, if unchecked, ultimately to cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. Clinicians should take steps to help their patients avoid unnecessary risks associated with antipsychotic use.

These steps include monitoring risk factors for developing these illnesses by taking careful patient histories and baseline measurements of patients' weight and blood chemistry. Patients should be made aware of potential metabolic and prolactin-related side effects, and periodic checks should also be made to watch for changes in weight, body mass index, waist size, blood pressure, fasting glucose, or lipid levels that could be harmful and may increase risk for cardiovascular disease.

### Cardiovascular effects of antipsychotics used in bipolar illness [^111XLFrV]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

Many antipsychotics are used to treat disorders other than schizophrenia, such as bipolar disorder. However, some of these agents are associated with cardiovascular side effects that can have serious or fatal implications for the patient. One dangerous side effect is QT prolongation, which can lead to torsades de pointes and ventricular arrhythmia. The group of drugs labeled as antipsychotics is diverse, making it challenging for the clinician to keep track of which agents cause which effects. Therefore, it is important for clinicians to learn to identify signs of cardiovascular side effects and manage those events when they occur.

### Metabolic effects of atypical antipsychotics: Molecular targets [^112dL4bR]. Journal of Neuroendocrinology (2023). High credibility.

Atypical antipsychotics (AAPs) are commonly prescribed drugs in the treatment of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and other mental diseases with psychotic traits. Although the use of AAPs is associated with beneficial effects in these patients, they are also linked with undesired metabolic side effects, including metabolic syndrome (MetS). MetS is defined by the presence of metabolic abnormalities such as large waist circumference, dyslipidemia, fasting hyperglycemia, and elevated blood pressure, which predispose to type 2 diabetes (T2D) and cardiovascular disease.

In this review, the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in these undesired metabolic abnormalities induced by AAPs are described. These mechanisms are complex as AAPs have multiple cellular targets which significantly affect the activities of several hormones and neuromodulators. Additionally, AAPs impact all the relevant metabolic organs, namely the liver, pancreas, adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and intestine, as well as the central and peripheral nervous system.

A better understanding of the molecular targets linking AAPs with MetS and of the mechanisms responsible for clinically different side effects of distinct AAPs is needed. This knowledge will help in the development of novel AAPs with fewer adverse effects, as well as adjuvant therapies for patients receiving AAPs.

### Movement disorders associated with neuroleptic treatment [^111XS5dZ]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

Neuroleptic-induced movement disorders, or extrapyramidal side effects (EPS), can be classified into acute and tardive syndromes. Among the former are parkinsonism, dystonia, and akathisia. Conventional neuroleptics that have traditionally been used to treat psychiatric disorders are often associated with EPS. The newer atypical antipsychotics provide a more promising treatment strategy for psychiatric disorders and have a lower potential for producing EPS than conventional neuroleptics.

### What side effects are problematic for patients prescribed antipsychotic medication? The Maudsley side Effects (MSE) measure for antipsychotic medication [^112MuNdn]. Psychological Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Why do we need a self-report measure?

National audits of clinical records in UK mental health services have found deficiencies in the quality and frequency of recommended side-effect screenings for patients prescribed antipsychotics in both community and inpatient settings. Observational studies and survey reports also found that, in clinical practice, mental health nurses tend to monitor only a limited number of antipsychotic side effects and rely on general questioning and observation to detect medication-related problems. This data collection method is inaccurate as patients tend to underestimate adverse effects in response to such general questions. The problems are no fewer in the clinical scientific evidence. Reviews of side-effect reporting conclude that most studies used no published side-effect rating scales except for movement disorders, or only assessed a limited range of effects. Spontaneous reporting of side effects important to patients is probably scarce given the likely misattribution of side effects to symptoms, forgetfulness, or embarrassment about raising intimate effects.

- **What should a measure include**: The comprehensive assessment of antipsychotic side effects presents several challenges, one being the diversity of potential problems, including anticholinergic and metabolic side effects and adverse effects on the motor, endocrine, and cardiovascular systems.

### Safety and tolerability of atypical antipsychotics in patients with bipolar disorder: Prevalence, monitoring and management [^112yUEVY]. Bipolar Disorders (2003). Low credibility.

Atypical antipsychotics are associated with fewer movement disorders and a lower risk of tardive dyskinesia than conventional antipsychotics but are not without side effects. Metabolic side effects associated with some atypical antipsychotics are a concern for both clinicians and patients. Adverse events related to central nervous system effects, weight gain, and alterations in glucose, lipid, and prolactin levels in patients with depression, bipolar disorder, and anxiety disorders have been reported.

Balancing the significant benefits of treatment with these agents against the potential risks of metabolic disturbances and other adverse effects is crucial. Emerging data are making it possible to determine the risk-benefit analysis for specific atypical antipsychotics in individual patients, allowing for targeted selection of treatment. A new concept of effectiveness is emerging that attempts to balance the adverse effects of treatment with patient quality of life.

Patients treated with atypical antipsychotics should have their weight, waist circumference, glucose, and lipids monitored on a regular basis. Monitoring of prolactin levels is not suggested; however, a baseline measurement before initiating treatment can be useful, with subsequent assessment only if a patient demonstrates symptoms. Prevention of weight gain is important. Diet and exercise should be considered for prevention and management, with the use of pharmacologic strategies approached with caution in patients with mood disorders. If a patient is at high risk of developing diabetes, certain pharmacologic agents should be considered.

### Addressing side effects from antipsychotic treatment in schizophrenia [^114vdAfT]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

Antipsychotic treatment of schizophrenia is associated with an array of adverse events, many of which are difficult for patients to tolerate and promote nonadherence to treatment. Serious adverse events include extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), hyperprolactinemia, weight gain leading to metabolic syndrome, sedation, cognitive deficits, and hypotension. Clinicians need to be aware of each antipsychotic's propensity to cause these adverse events, as well as strategies for avoiding or minimizing their occurrence.

### The American Psychiatric Association practice guideline for the treatment of patients with schizophrenia [^114P2JYw]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for schizophrenia, specifically concerning the management of drug side effects, APA 2020 guidelines recommend considering the following options for patients experiencing akathisia with antipsychotic therapy:

- **Lowering the dosage**: Reduce the dosage of the antipsychotic medication.
- **Switching medications**: Switch to another antipsychotic medication.
- **Adding benzodiazepine**: Add a benzodiazepine medication.
- **Adding β-adrenergic blocking agent**: Incorporate a β-adrenergic blocking agent.

### Retrograde ejaculation associated with quetiapine and treatment with low-dose imipramine [^114BMcfb]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

Sexual side effects are common among those using antipsychotic medication and may result in poor compliance and reduced quality of life. Retrograde ejaculation (RE) has been described as occurring with a number of antipsychotic medications, including thioridazine, risperidone, iloperidone, and clozapine, but there are no guidelines regarding management of antipsychotic-associated RE. Imipramine has been suggested as a treatment for antipsychotic-associated RE in one small study of patients prescribed thioridazine and a case series of patients prescribed iloperidone.

Quetiapine is a commonly used antipsychotic and is thought to be associated with fewer sexual side effects relative to other antipsychotic medications. This case report describes a 25-year-old man with first episode psychosis who developed RE during treatment with quetiapine, which improved with low-dose imipramine. This is the first description of RE occurring with quetiapine and successful treatment of quetiapine-associated RE with imipramine.

### The American Psychiatric Association practice guideline on the use of antipsychotics to treat agitation or psychosis in patients with dementia [^113hWHC8]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2016). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia, specifically concerning antipsychotics, tapering, and discontinuation, APA 2016 guidelines recommend discussing the possible tapering of the antipsychotic with the patient (if clinically feasible) and the patient's surrogate decision-maker (if relevant). This discussion should involve input from family or others involved with the patient in the case of a positive response to treatment.

Elicit their preferences and concerns and review the initial goals, observed benefits and side effects of antipsychotic treatment, and potential risks of continued exposure to antipsychotics. Additionally, consider the past experience with antipsychotic medication trials and tapering attempts.

### The impact of hyperprolactinaemia on sexual function in patients with psychosis [^114QE5C7]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2008). Low credibility.

Sexual dysfunction is a common but significantly underestimated side effect of antipsychotic medication. It is frequently related to the hyperprolactinaemia induced by the dopamine-blocking properties of these agents, but may also be related to the anti-serotonergic, anticholinergic, and antiadrenergic properties of antipsychotics. Knowledge of the receptor pharmacology of an individual antipsychotic will help to determine whether it is more or less likely to cause sexual side effects.

### Worsening stimulant use disorder outcomes coinciding with off-label antipsychotic prescribing: A commonly unrecognised side effect [^116dJ74p]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). Low credibility.

Antipsychotic medications are widely used off-label among persons with substance use disorder (SUD). Their antidopaminergic effects may alleviate symptoms of SUD — including anxiety, low mood, and insomnia. Additionally, some reports note that certain psychoactive medications, including antipsychotics, are diverted and used outside of a normal prescription for symptom management or for the perceived ability to augment the 'high' of illicit drugs. In these contexts, the off-label prescribing of certain antipsychotic medications has become increasingly concerning.

While dopamine antagonists are recognized to stimulate food cravings and weight gain, outside of the possible role in increasing nicotine craving and use, their impact on other SUD outcomes is poorly recognized. Research has demonstrated that antipsychotic therapy can produce 'supersensitivity' to dopamine, enhancing the motivational effects of addictive drugs. This case report focuses on the possible unintended consequences of dopamine antagonists, such as worsening stimulant cravings and use disorder.

The report acknowledges that there may be clinical circumstances where off-label use is beneficial. For example, during severe agitation and anxiety in stimulant intoxication or among individuals with severe conditions like schizophrenia, where they are indicated. Nevertheless, the widespread off-label antipsychotic use requires caution.

### Making sense of the literature on antipsychotics and long-term functioning: Taking natural history and personalization seriously [^112KLgRm]. Psychological Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Antipsychotics are generally effective in the short-term management of psychosis, improving not only symptom control but also quality of life and functioning. A comprehensive analysis by Leucht et al. of 167 RCTs conducted over 60 years reported a standardized mean difference (SMD) of 0.45 for positive symptoms (typically regarded as a medium-sized effect), with SMDs of 0.35 for quality of life and 0.34 for functioning (conventionally, small-sized effects), confirming moderate benefits in these domains.

For maintenance treatment, antipsychotics have shown similar efficacy, particularly in preventing relapse within the first year of treatment. A Cochrane review and meta-analysis by Ceraso et al. involving 75 RCTs found that antipsychotic medications significantly reduced relapse rates (24% v. 61% for placebo, 30 RCTs, RR = 0.38) and hospitalizations (7% v. 18% for placebo, 21 RCTs, RR = 0.43). These drugs also modestly improved quality of life (SMD = −0.32, 95% CI = −0.57 to −0.07) and social functioning (SMD = −0.43, 95% CI = −0.53 to −0.34).

However, these benefits come with a substantial risk of adverse effects, which can negatively impact functioning for some patients. Common side effects include sedation, akathisia, anticholinergic effects, and weight gain. Ceraso et al. reported higher incidences of movement disorders (14% v. 8% for placebo), sedation (8% v. 5%), and weight gain (9% v. 6%) in maintenance studies.

### American diabetes association postgraduate meetings — 2011 [^111eyYnZ]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Henderson characterized tardive dyskinesia, the major side effect of the first-generation antipsychotic agents, as being quite uncomfortable but not associated with increased mortality, whereas there is concern that SGA agents' side effects may, in fact, increase mortality. The diagnosis of schizophrenia itself appears to be associated with visceral adiposity. Nearly half of schizophrenic patients have metabolic syndrome, making this a high-risk group for such adverse drug effects. Similar evidence of adverse metabolic effects of SGA has been found in children and adolescents.

There is extensive evidence that SGA agents, particularly clozapine and olanzapine, and to a lesser extent risperidone and quetiapine, are associated with an increased likelihood of diabetes and progressive weight gain, although ziprasidone and fluphenazine appear to be weight neutral. Furthermore, clozapine and olanzapine are associated with reduced insulin sensitivity in comparison with risperidone, even in the absence of obesity.

There has been interest in the use of medications to cause weight loss, including the antidepressants bupropion, fluoxetine, and sertraline; the antiepileptic topiramate — although its association with cognitive impairment limits its use — and zonisamide, metformin, and chromium. A study of patients with new-onset schizophrenia receiving olanzapine showed that adding metformin attenuated weight gain, although with some gastrointestinal side effects. However, "the best data", Henderson stated, "has been switching the patient off the offending agent" with diabetes sometimes resolving as a result.

### Second-generation antipsychotic drugs and short-term mortality: A systematic review and meta-analysis of placebo-controlled randomised controlled trials [^1113ija4]. The Lancet Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Acutely occurring, life-threatening side effects of antipsychotic drugs might contribute to the reduced life expectancy observed in patients with severe mental disorders. We aimed to assess this hypothesis by conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis of deaths occurring in placebo-controlled trials of antipsychotic drugs.

- **Methods**: For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we included randomized controlled trials comparing second-generation antipsychotics with placebo across several diagnostic categories. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane CENTRAL, BIOSIS, PsycINFO, PubMed, ClinicalTrials.gov, and WHO ICTRP from inception (the last search was done on Jan 21, 2017), and contacted pharmaceutical companies and regulatory authorities for further eligible trials. We examined mortality from any cause (the primary outcome) and mortality from natural causes, suicide, and other non-natural causes. We synthesized the results using odds ratios (ORs) in a common-effects meta-analysis. We investigated the effects of age, diagnostic category, sex, study duration, antipsychotic drug used, drug dose, and polypharmacy through subgroup and meta-regression analyses.

- **Findings**: We identified 596 randomized controlled trials published between 1978 and 2017, comprising 108,747 participants. 352 studies (comprising 84,988 participants) with available mortality data constituted the main dataset for our meta-analysis. There were 207 (0.4%) deaths reported among 53,804 patients on an antipsychotic drug and 99 (0.3%) deaths among 31,184 patients in the placebo group.

### Receptor-binding profiles of antipsychotics: Clinical strategies when switching between agents [^116qmwvK]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2007). Low credibility.

In spite of apparent improvements in the pharmacotherapy of schizophrenia, many patients still demonstrate an incomplete therapeutic response to antipsychotic medication and/or intolerable adverse effects, necessitating a change in their medication regimen. The switch from one antipsychotic to another, however, is not without challenges and can be complicated by withdrawal-emergent adverse effects that prompt the patient or the clinician to abort the switch. The extent to which these adverse events can be predicted by comparing the effects of the old and new antipsychotic medications on various receptor systems, including dopaminergic, muscarinic, and histaminergic receptors, is of considerable clinical and research interest. For example, patients receiving a sedating antipsychotic with high affinity for histamine H(1) receptors could experience rebound insomnia if switched to a less sedating agent with a low affinity for H(1) receptors. An understanding of the differential receptor-binding profiles of the various antipsychotics can help clinicians anticipate and manage potential clinical issues that may be encountered when switching antipsychotic therapy.

### Quality improvement in resident education: A pilot project to mitigate metabolic side effects from atypical antipsychotic medications in youth [^115xvNeB]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2015). Low credibility.

Individuals treated with atypical antipsychotic medications during critical periods of development may experience long-lasting negative health effects. Some children remain on these medications for extended periods, thus increasing exposure during critical development times. Overweight children have increased rates of metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes. Another study reported that children who are overweight have increased rates of carotid intimal media thickening, a risk factor for cerebrovascular accidents.

Juonala et al. (2005) revealed that childhood obesity, high LDL, and low HDL are associated with decreased carotid artery elasticity in adulthood, which is also a risk factor for cerebrovascular accidents. A prospective cohort study of 2,195 children followed for 21 years in Finland demonstrated that childhood obesity, high triglycerides, high insulin, and high CRP are risk factors for adult metabolic syndrome.

It is important for residents to feel empowered to undertake quality improvement (QI) endeavors, such as improving side effect monitoring of medications to enhance clinical care for their patients. Quality improvement was included as a required core competency in systems-based care education by the United States Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) in July 2011. However, there is little guidance on how best to integrate these ACGME guidelines with practical implementation.

### Antipsychotic drugs and extrapyramidal side effects in first episode psychosis: A systematic review of head-head comparisons [^11522qag]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2012). Low credibility.

This systematic review aimed to determine whether the risk of extrapyramidal side effects (EPS) differed between antipsychotic drugs used in first episode psychosis (FEP). We identified 11 RCTs comparing two or more antipsychotics in FEP and reporting on EPS. All trials assessed one or more second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs); one assessed chlorpromazine, one zuclopenthixol, and seven trials assessed haloperidol. Assessment and reporting of EPS varied. Compared with one or more SGA comparators, haloperidol was associated with significantly higher rates/severity of parkinsonism, akathisia, and greater use of anticholinergics and beta-blockers. Two trials with low-dose haloperidol (≤ 4 mg) showed significantly worse EPS outcomes versus an SGA. Two of four long-term haloperidol trials (≥ 1 year) found a higher dyskinesia-risk with haloperidol versus olanzapine and risperidone respectively; the remaining two trials found no difference (various SGA comparators). There was an EPS advantage for clozapine versus chlorpromazine and risperidone versus zuclopenthixol. There was little evidence of EPS-differences between SGAs, possibly reflecting the use of low doses. We conclude that SGAs offer an EPS advantage over FGAs in FEP, though the evidence largely relates to comparisons with haloperidol. Standardized assessment and reporting of EPS would assist future research.

### Atypical antipsychotics and newer antidepressants [^114FfSfJ]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Atypical antipsychotics and newer antidepressants are commonly prescribed medications responsible for tens of thousands of adverse drug exposures each year. Emergency medicine physicians should have a basic understanding of the pharmacology and toxicity of these agents. This knowledge is crucial for providing proper care and timely management of patients presenting with adverse drug effects from exposure to atypical antipsychotics and newer antidepressants.

### Clinicians' recognition of the metabolic adverse effects of antipsychotic medications [^111yk7D7]. Schizophrenia Research (2005). Low credibility.

There is a growing concern regarding the propensity of second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) to induce weight gain and metabolic adverse effects. Recent consensus guidelines have recommended assessment and monitoring procedures to appropriately detect and manage these adverse effects. This study addresses the appreciation and readiness of clinicians to implement management guidelines for these adverse effects. Respondents indicated awareness of the risks of treatment with SGAs. The extent of monitoring for metabolic adverse effects was low and inconsistent across measures and in frequency of evaluation. Ongoing efforts are needed to support and encourage change in clinician practice.

### Comparative efficacy and tolerability of 32 oral antipsychotics for the acute treatment of adults with multi-episode schizophrenia: A systematic review and network meta-analysis [^116Go8Yw]. Lancet (2019). High credibility.

Because so many antipsychotic options are available, our results should help healthcare providers find the most suitable drug for the individual patient, balancing side-effect profiles and the efficacy of different drugs. We confirm that antipsychotics differ more in their side effects than in their efficacy. We believe that efficacy differences between compounds exist, but the fact that their measurement is based on subjective rating scales is problematic. The development of objective efficacy measures would render interpretation easier. Clinicians must remember that reported results are averages and that response and side effects might vary considerably in individual patients.

### Addressing adverse effects of antipsychotic treatment in young patients with schizophrenia [^111brCgP]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

Children and adolescents are at a greater risk than adults for antipsychotic-induced adverse effects such as extrapyramidal symptoms, prolactin elevation, sedation, weight gain, and metabolic effects, which can have long-term health consequences for young patients. Clinicians should complete careful baseline assessments and perform dietary and lifestyle counseling when initiating antipsychotic treatment, then proactively monitor for adverse effects to optimize physical as well as psychiatric outcomes. Strategies to manage adverse effects that occur or worsen during treatment include switching medications, lowering the dosage of medications, and initiating targeted treatments to address clinically relevant changes.

### Predicting parkinsonism side-effects of antipsychotic polypharmacy prescribed in secondary mental healthcare [^112RK4bh]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2018). Low credibility.

Antipsychotic polypharmacy (APP) use has been discouraged by existing guidelines due to lack of evidence supporting its effectiveness, as well as evidence indicating an increased risk for further hospitalizations, high dose prescribing, side-effects, and mortality. However, APP remains prevalent in clinical practice, highlighting the increasing need to better understand interactions between different antipsychotics.

Previous literature on APP suggests that side-effects are common, with their nature and severity substantially dependent on the dose and type of antipsychotics used. Currently, there are no guidelines for APP prescribing, except in relation to pharmacokinetic–pharmacodynamic interactions; however, these do not specify which antipsychotics can be combined and at what doses. At present, it is common to grade antipsychotic combinations using chlorpromazine equivalents to estimate the risk for the occurrence of side-effects. While this has been successful for single antipsychotics, the non-linear interactions of two or more antipsychotics at different receptor systems render this approach less useful for combination treatments.

In this project, we focused on parkinsonism as an adverse drug event to evaluate the potential of a new predictive algorithm based on quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP). This approach contrasts with 'big data' analytics, which rely on high-quality training sets that are often not available or easily generalizable. The QSP approach is based on a computer model of relevant human pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, providing a more focused methodology for predicting potential side-effects.

### Neuropsychiatric disorders: The choice of antipsychotics in schizophrenia [^113hMy4U]. Nature Reviews Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

Second-generation antipsychotics have emerged as the predominant treatment for schizophrenia, largely due to claims of improved efficacy and a lower incidence of adverse effects compared to older drugs. However, a new meta-analysis concludes that the difference in efficacy between newer and older agents is small. The classification scheme for antipsychotics does not withstand close scrutiny.

### Treating movement disorders and akathisia as side effects of antipsychotic pharmacotherapy [^1138CNru]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

One of the most common reasons for switching antipsychotic medication is to reduce the burden of side effects, particularly movement disorders and akathisia associated with typical antipsychotics. Adjusting the antipsychotic dose and, if necessary, switching treatment to an antipsychotic with low extrapyramidal symptom liability may help to optimize the clinical management of schizophrenia. Switching from a typical to an atypical antipsychotic or between atypical antipsychotics involves considering a variety of factors relating to the patient, illness, medication, and the patient's environment.

### Haloperidol [^116Y5g94]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

There is considerable variation in the amount of medication required for treatment from patient to patient. As with all antipsychotic drugs, the dosage of haloperidol should be individualized according to the needs and response of each patient. Dosage adjustments, whether upward or downward, should be carried out as rapidly as practicable to achieve optimum therapeutic control.

To determine the initial dosage, consideration should be given to the patient's age, severity of illness, previous response to other antipsychotic drugs, and any concomitant medication or disease state.

- **Children, debilitated, or geriatric patients**: These patients, as well as those with a history of adverse reactions to antipsychotic drugs, may require less haloperidol. The optimal response in such patients is usually obtained with more gradual dosage adjustments and at lower dosage levels, as recommended below.

### Common pitfalls, and how to avoid them, in child and adolescent psychopharmacology: Part II [^115HqrYc]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2024). Low credibility.

- **Dosing**: When using antipsychotics in young people, particularly in children, it is important to adjust doses considering efficacy and tolerability. Adjusting dosages based solely on body weight has not proven adequate. Although a general recommendation for antipsychotic therapy is to "start low and go slow", a common pitfall is not using full dosages due to concerns about adverse events. In the event of a lack of efficacy, clinicians should raise dosages to the maximum recommended levels while monitoring for adverse events. However, increasing antipsychotic dosages above the maximum recommended dose, a common pitfall in cases with inadequate response, should be avoided as it results in greater differences in side effects than in efficacy. Abrupt cessation of antipsychotic medications can cause withdrawal dyskinesia and a syndrome of deteriorating behavior in children and adolescents.

- **Management of treatment-resistant psychosis**: Managing treatment resistance is also challenging in children and adolescents with psychosis. There is high variability among practitioners in the waiting time before switching to another antipsychotic in cases of treatment non-response. Although recommendations from guidelines may differ, waiting more than six weeks in cases of no improvement in psychotic symptoms or functioning is not supported by evidence and should be avoided. A common practice in cases of non-response, besides increasing dosages above the maximum recommended dose, is to use an antipsychotic combination therapy.

### Antipsychotics in the treatment of schizophrenia: an overview [^113xpgNK]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

Schizophrenia is characterized by positive, negative, cognitive, disorganization, and mood symptoms. Antipsychotics are the mainstay in the pharmacologic treatment of schizophrenia. Findings concerning efficacy for positive symptoms and disorganization suggest no consistent differences among available antipsychotics, with the exception of clozapine's superior efficacy for treatment-resistant schizophrenia.

Efficacy for negative, depressive, and cognitive symptoms appears to be determined by:
(1) The extent to which reduction in positive symptoms brings about improvement in these other domains.
(2) The extent to which extrapyramidal side effects (EPS) and anticholinergic effects (of the antipsychotic and of agents used to treat EPS) exacerbate them.

Thus, the ability of antipsychotics to produce a potent antipsychotic effect without EPS and need for concomitant anticholinergic therapy yields multiple therapeutic benefits. In contrast to their broadly similar efficacy, antipsychotics differ markedly in their propensity to cause various adverse effects.

Although second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) have generally been believed to be associated with a lower risk of EPS but a higher risk of metabolic adverse effects than first-generation agents (FGAs), the substantial variation in these and other side effects among agents within both classes indicates that it is not clinically useful to make a categorical distinction between FGAs and SGAs. Choice of antipsychotic medication should be based on individual preference, prior treatment response and side effect experience.

### Brain deficit patterns of metabolic illnesses overlap with those for major depressive disorder: A new metric of brain metabolic disease [^113AmSaG]. Human Brain Mapping (2023). Low credibility.

The higher rates of MET in patients with mental illnesses raise the concern of potential side effects of long-term use of psychiatric medications. Antipsychotics, in particular, may increase the risk of developing metabolic syndrome, obesity, hypertension, and diabetes. Specifically, people taking second-generation antipsychotics are at increased risk for developing diabetes compared to patients taking first-generation antipsychotics.

Antipsychotic use in adolescent and young adult patients with schizophrenia has been associated with higher overall MET rates. Similarly, a study by Andersohn et al. reported that long-term antidepressant use was associated with higher rates of diabetes. The dose and duration of antidepressant use were significantly correlated with total cholesterol in adults, including both LDL and HDL levels. Another study found a positive correlation between the cumulative dose of antidepressants and hypertension.

Conversely, the combined use of antidepressants and antihypertensive drugs resulted in better control over blood pressure in a 24-week trial versus taking only antihypertensive drugs, especially in older populations. Overall, there is strong evidence that long-term use of antipsychotics is associated with risks for MET, but the links between the use of antidepressants and MET are more tenuous.

### Antidepressant and antipsychotic side-effects and personalised prescribing: A systematic review and digital tool development [^113o7wJc]. The Lancet Psychiatry (2023). Low credibility.

In high-income countries, up to 17% of adults are prescribed antidepressants, and up to 2% are prescribed antipsychotics. Rates of prescribing antidepressants and antipsychotics are increasing year on year. Although antipsychotics and antidepressants are effective treatments in some patients, approximately 75% of patients experience side-effects. These side-effects are diverse and can impair quality of life and functioning, contribute to morbidity and mortality rates, create stigma, and result in poor medication concordance, thus increasing the risk of relapse of psychiatric illness.

Side-effects are factors that people with depression and schizophrenia primarily consider when making prescription decisions, and concerns about side-effects represent a barrier to the treatment of mental illness. National and professional bodies recommend that side-effect discussions are central to antipsychotic and antidepressant prescribing decisions. However, simultaneously considering the relative side-effect profile for every available antidepressant and antipsychotic is a complex, multidimensional process.

For example, a discussion regarding which of 20 antidepressants to select on the basis of the relative risk of ten side-effects involves 1900 pairwise comparisons; spending 10 seconds considering each comparison would require more than 5 hours of discussion. This process is further complicated by the fact that the avoidance of some side-effects will be important to one patient but not to another, meaning that, at an individual level, greater consideration needs to be given to avoiding specific side effects.

### Prolactin, hyperprolactinaemia and antipsychotic treatment: a review and lessons for treatment of early psychosis [^111dyEMQ]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2012). Low credibility.

Hyperprolactinaemia is a common side effect of antipsychotics, with markedly raised levels being less common. Higher levels of prolactin result from longer exposure to higher doses, especially with older antipsychotics or with risperidone, sulpiride, or amisulpride. Consequences of raised prolactin include galactorrhoea, gynaecomastia, menstrual abnormalities, and sexual dysfunction, including hypogonadism and fertility problems. In the longer term, bone demineralisation can also occur. Younger patients may be more susceptible to hyperprolactinaemia. Trial reports often fail to state the frequency of raised levels.

### Antidepressant and antipsychotic side-effects and personalised prescribing: A systematic review and digital tool development [^113EEkGc]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2023). High credibility.

Both meta-analytic and ordinal outcomes were normalized (minimum–maximum scaled) to provide values between 0 and 1. These normalized scores were used as proxy effect sizes. When there was more than one meta-analysis for a given side-effect, the meta-analysis examining the largest number of drugs was selected. Consequently, meta-analyses with sample overlap were excluded. When multiple guidelines ranked drugs for the same side-effect, a mean of the normalized scores was calculated.

We imputed missing effect sizes for drug–side-effect pairs based on ordinal ranking scores as follows: when there were ten or more of each type of data point (≥ 10 meta-analytic effect sizes and ≥ 10 ordinal ranking scores) for the same drug–side-effect pair, linear regression was used to define the relationship between ordinal ranking scores (the predictor, or independent variable) and meta-analytic effect sizes (the predicted, or dependent variable) for the given side-effect. This model was then used to predict missing meta-analytic effect sizes for other drugs based on available ranking scores. If there were fewer than ten overlapping data points and imputation was not possible, ordinal scores were extracted. If multiple meta-analyses examined the same side-effect for the same number of drugs, the meta-analysis with the largest regression model coefficient of determination was selected.

The validity of some side-effect network meta-analysis results has been queried due to the inclusion of small outlier studies. Therefore, we excluded meta-analytic effect sizes and used imputed data instead.

### Improvement in cognition associated with novel antipsychotic drugs: A direct drug effect or reduction of EPS [^1177aDdt]. Schizophrenia Research (2000). Low credibility.

The administration of novel, versus classic, antipsychotic agents to patients suffering from psychosis is associated with both moderately better scores on cognitive tests and fewer extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS). Improved motor functioning may enable better performance on some components of cognitive test batteries. Since the advantages of novel antipsychotics on cognitive performance are not very large, it is sometimes difficult to discern if improvement in a given cognitive task is due to a direct effect of the novel antipsychotic drug or is secondary to the novel drug's decreased propensity to induce EPS. To distinguish between these possibilities, the present study examined the ability of patients suffering from schizophrenia receiving classic versus novel antipsychotics to perform a computerized visuo-motor test (VMT). The VMT assesses planning capabilities, attention, and executive functions known to be impaired in schizophrenia, which are suggested to be affected by novel antipsychotics.

- **Methods**: Seventy-six patients suffering from schizophrenia or schizophreniform disorder, receiving haloperidol (23 patients, mean dose 10.01 ± 6.1mg/day), olanzapine (26 patients, mean dose 10.56 ± 4.9 mg/day), or risperidone (27 patients, mean dose 4.35 ± 1.7 mg/day) were assessed for EPS using the parkinsonian subscale of the Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Subscale (ESRS) and with the VMT.

- **Results**: Cognitive functioning, as measured by the VMT, was better for patients receiving risperidone or olanzapine compared with those receiving haloperidol.

### Effectiveness of antipsychotic drugs in patients with chronic schizophrenia [^115uXxBT]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

The relative effectiveness of second-generation (atypical) antipsychotic drugs compared to older agents has been incompletely addressed, though newer agents are currently used far more commonly. We compared a first-generation antipsychotic, perphenazine, with several newer drugs in a double-blind study.

- **Methods**: A total of 1,493 patients with schizophrenia were recruited at 57 U.S. sites and randomly assigned to receive olanzapine (7.5 to 30 mg per day), perphenazine (8 to 32 mg per day), quetiapine (200 to 800 mg per day), or risperidone (1.5 to 6.0 mg per day) for up to 18 months. Ziprasidone (40 to 160 mg per day) was included after its approval by the Food and Drug Administration. The primary aim was to delineate differences in the overall effectiveness of these five treatments.

- **Results**: Overall, 74 percent of patients discontinued the study medication before 18 months (1,061 of the 1,432 patients who received at least one dose): 64 percent of those assigned to olanzapine, 75 percent of those assigned to perphenazine, 82 percent of those assigned to quetiapine, 74 percent of those assigned to risperidone, and 79 percent of those assigned to ziprasidone. The time to the discontinuation of treatment for any cause was significantly longer in the olanzapine group than in the quetiapine (P < 0.001) or risperidone (P = 0.002) group, but not in the perphenazine (P = 0.021) or ziprasidone (P = 0.028) group. The times to discontinuation because of intolerable side effects were similar among the groups, but the rates differed (P = 0.04); olanzapine was associated with a higher rate of certain side effects compared to others.

### Worsening stimulant use disorder outcomes coinciding with off-label antipsychotic prescribing: A commonly unrecognised side effect [^114MBH92]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). Low credibility.

Antipsychotic medications exert their effects via dopamine antagonism and are widely used off-label among persons with substance use disorders (SUD). While dopamine antagonists are recognised to stimulate food craving and weight gain, their impact on other SUD outcomes, outside of possibly increasing nicotine craving and use, is poorly recognised. In this context, research has demonstrated that antipsychotic therapy can produce 'supersensitivity' to dopamine, enhancing the motivational effects of addictive drugs. Worsened drug craving and higher rates of substance use have been observed in double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. Nevertheless, the widespread off-label antipsychotic prescribing among persons with SUD implies that the risks of worsening SUD outcomes are overall poorly recognised in both primary care and among specialists. We present a typical case of worsening stimulant use disorder in a patient prescribed antipsychotic medication for low mood and insomnia, highlighting that this is likely a widely under-recognised adverse effect of off-label antipsychotic therapy.

### Reducing the burden of side effects during long-term antipsychotic therapy: The role of "switching" medications [^117PmXJ5]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2007). Low credibility.

One of the great challenges of long-term treatment of schizophrenia and related disorders is minimizing the medical or psychological burden from persistent side effects. Because of the differences in side effect profiles between the newer and older antipsychotic medications, and distinct differences among the newer agents themselves, the spectrum of side effects associated with antipsychotic therapy has changed tremendously. The authors review changing from one antipsychotic to another ("switching") as a potential treatment strategy for reducing the overall side effect burden of antipsychotic therapy.

This review identifies six steps to the evaluation of switching antipsychotics because of side effects:

1. Establish a causal attribution that the clinical problem is an adverse effect of the antipsychotic medication.
2. Understand the course of the side effect, especially regarding present and future risks for the individual patient receiving the antipsychotic treatment.
3. Understand the potential risks and benefits of other side effect interventions that do not require switching the antipsychotic.
4. Be aware of the side effect profiles of other possible antipsychotics, with an understanding of the potential effectiveness of changing (switching) to another antipsychotic for this side effect.
5. Calculate the side effect risks of switching antipsychotics.
6. Calculate the efficacy risks of switching antipsychotics.

The authors explain how to evaluate the specific side effect in the context of the medication and the overall management of the patient.

### Sexual side effects of novel antipsychotic medications [^114s5hmu]. Schizophrenia Research (2002). Low credibility.

The novel antipsychotic medications offer a more favorable extrapyramidal side effect profile than conventional agents. However, it is uncertain whether these novel antipsychotics provide any benefit regarding sexual side effects.

- **Methods**: We prospectively administered a survey of sexual functioning to 25 male patients with DSM-IV schizophrenia taking both conventional and novel antipsychotics. Contrasts were made between three treatment groups: clozapine (CLOZ), risperidone (RIS), and a combined haloperidol/fluphenazine (HAL/FLU) group.

- **Results**: A decrease in overall sexual functioning was reported in all medication groups (40–71%). The majority of subjects taking RIS or HAL/FLU reported a decline in one or more aspects of sexual functioning. Examining specific aspects of sexual functioning revealed that a decline in sexual interest was significantly less common on CLOZ compared to RIS (0% vs. 64%; chi² = 6.1, df = 1, p = 0.01) or HAL/FLU (0% vs. 67%; chi² = 5.2, df = 1, p = 0.02). However, a decline in erectile frequency was significantly more common on RIS compared to CLOZ (40% vs. 93%; chi² = 6.2, df = 1, p = 0.01) or HAL/FLU (50% vs. 93%; chi² = 4.8, df = 1, p = 0.03). For enjoyment of orgasm and ejaculatory volume, significantly fewer CLOZ subjects compared to RIS subjects reported a decline (20% vs. 86%; chi² = 7.4, df = 1, p = 0.01).

- **Conclusions**: Sexual side effects are common and clinically pertinent adverse effects associated with both novel and conventional antipsychotic medications. These side effects deserve increased attention in clinical work and future research with emerging antipsychotic drugs.

### Olanzapine [^115Cmnsi]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The stated frequencies of adverse reactions represent the proportion of individuals who experienced, at least once, a treatment-emergent adverse reaction of the type listed. A reaction was considered treatment emergent if it occurred for the first time or worsened while receiving therapy following baseline evaluation. The reported reactions do not include those reaction terms that were so general as to be uninformative. Reactions listed elsewhere in labeling may not be repeated below. It is important to emphasize that, although the reactions occurred during treatment with olanzapine, they were not necessarily caused by it. The entire label should be read to gain a complete understanding of the safety profile of olanzapine.

The prescriber should be aware that the figures in the tables and tabulations cannot be used to predict the incidence of side effects in the course of usual medical practice, where patient characteristics and other factors differ from those that prevailed in the clinical trials. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments, uses, and investigators. The cited figures, however, do provide the prescribing healthcare provider with some basis for estimating the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the adverse reactions' incidence in the population studied.

- **Incidence of adverse reactions in short-term, placebo-controlled and combination trials**: The following findings are based on premarketing trials of oral olanzapine for schizophrenia, and bipolar I disorder.

### Tolerability of antipsychotics: Recent controversies and future management [^114BB8VK]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

Individuals with schizophrenia experience increased morbidity and mortality due to both natural and unnatural causes. Some antipsychotics used to treat this disorder may contribute to the poor physical health in this population. Clinicians must accept responsibility for both the physical and mental health care of patients with schizophrenia by preferentially selecting antipsychotics with a low incidence of adverse side effects, monitoring for any metabolic disturbances that may be associated with these drugs, and actively managing risk factors that may worsen patients' physical health.

### Intermittent drug techniques for schizophrenia [^116ES7bQ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Antipsychotic medication is considered the mainstay of treatment for schizophrenia and is generally regarded as highly effective, especially in controlling positive symptoms. However, long-term antipsychotic exposure has been associated with a range of adverse effects, including extra-pyramidal symptoms (EPS), neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), tardive dyskinesia, and death. Intermittent drug techniques refer to the 'use of medication only during periods of incipient relapse or symptom exacerbation rather than continuously'. The aim is to reduce the risk of typical adverse effects of antipsychotics by 'reducing long-term medication exposure for patients who are receiving maintenance treatment while limiting the risk of relapse'; with a further goal of improving social functioning resulting from the reduction of antipsychotic-induced side effects.

- **Objectives**: To review the effects of different intermittent drug techniques compared with maintenance treatment in people with schizophrenia or related disorders.

- **Search methods**: We searched The Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (April 2012) and supplemented this by contacting relevant study authors, hand-searching relevant intermittent drug treatment articles, and manually searching reference lists.

- **Selection criteria**: All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared intermittent drug techniques with standard maintenance therapy for people with schizophrenia. Primary outcomes of interest were relapse and hospitalisation.

- **Data collection and analysis**: At least two review authors selected trials.

### Antidepressant and antipsychotic side-effects and personalised prescribing: A systematic review and digital tool development [^115jpSYm]. The Lancet Psychiatry (2023). High credibility.

- **Research in context**:

- **Evidence before this study**: Although clinical guidelines stipulate the need for discussion between clinician and patient about antidepressant and antipsychotic side-effects before making prescription decisions, they do not specify how this complex, multidimensional process should be done. We searched PubMed for studies that provide an evidence-based synthesis of the relative risk or magnitude of antidepressant or antipsychotic side-effects using data from randomised controlled trials, with the search terms "(antipsychotic OR antidepressant) AND side effect", filtering for systematic review. We then searched PubMed from database inception up to Jan 28, 2023, with no language restrictions, for studies describing a digital tool that facilitates antidepressant or antipsychotic prescriptions in people with depression or schizophrenia by considering all side-effects of all treatments while also incorporating individual patient concerns, with the search terms "(antipsychotic OR antidepressant OR depression OR schizophrenia) AND side effect AND digital tool". Of the 737 studies retrieved, 14 provided meta-analytic data for antipsychotic or antidepressant side-effects. However, these studies were limited by either focusing on a restricted range of side-effects or a limited number of drugs. Thus, no studies were identified that have provided clinicians with a comprehensive, evidence-based synthesis of antidepressant or antipsychotic side-effects. Furthermore, no studies were identified describing a digital application to facilitate antidepressant or antipsychotic prescribing.

### Quality improvement in resident education: A pilot project to mitigate metabolic side effects from atypical antipsychotic medications in youth [^11538yPg]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2015). Low credibility.

This resident physician-led quality improvement project aimed to enhance the health of youth prescribed atypical antipsychotic medications by increasing physician monitoring for metabolic side effects while simultaneously educating trainees in quality improvement methodology. The plan, do, study, act quality improvement framework was utilized. Baseline metabolic monitoring rates of patients prescribed atypical antipsychotic medications in the two psychiatry resident outpatient clinics were obtained. Rates were stratified based on time on medication (< 1 year, ≥ 1 year) and parameter monitored. Subsequent metabolic monitoring rates following targeted changes were obtained.

Problem-solving sessions with residents revealed barriers to monitoring, such as limited awareness of specific guideline recommendations and lack of convenient access to medical equipment, like calibrated scales. Residents received education about atypical antipsychotic monitoring guidelines and side effect treatment. They were provided with calibrated scales, and atypical antipsychotic monitoring templates were introduced.

Online surveys were conducted to determine self-reported baseline monitoring rates and comfort with guidelines following targeted changes. The baseline metabolic monitoring rates of patients prescribed atypical antipsychotic medications was 9% (range: 0 to 17.6%) for youth in their first year taking an atypical antipsychotic medication and 58.9% (range: 29% to 100%) in subsequent years on medication. The implementation of relatively simple changes led to modest improvements in monitoring.

### Safety and tolerability of antipsychotic treatment in young patients with schizophrenia [^112yaLy8]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

Antipsychotics have proven efficacy for treating patients with early-onset schizophrenia, and aripiprazole, olanzapine, quetiapine, and risperidone have FDA approval for treating adolescents aged 13 to 17 years. Children and adolescents appear to have a higher risk than adults for experiencing adverse events, such as extrapyramidal symptoms, prolactin elevation, weight gain, and metabolic effects when taking antipsychotic medications. Pediatric studies indicate that adverse effect profiles differ among commonly used antipsychotics. Clinicians should consider the differing adverse effect profiles when choosing medications for young patients.

### What is the role of sedating antidepressants, antipsychotics, and anticonvulsants in the management of insomnia [^115tVjP6]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2012). Low credibility.

Psychiatric medications such as antidepressants, antipsychotics, and anticonvulsants are commonly prescribed by physicians for the off-label use of improving sleep. The preference for these medications over FDA-approved insomnia drugs may be due to the desire to address both sleep problems and psychiatric illness with a single medication or to avoid hypnotic drugs because of their publicized side effects. However, there have been few large studies demonstrating the efficacy and safety of most off-label medications prescribed for insomnia. Additionally, many of these medications have significant known side effect profiles.

This review explores pertinent research studies published in recent years regarding antidepressant, antipsychotic, and anticonvulsant medications frequently prescribed for sleep difficulties. Although there have been few large-scale studies for most of these medications, some may be appropriate for treating sleep issues in specific, well-defined populations.

### The American Psychiatric Association practice guideline for the treatment of patients with schizophrenia [^112b3t6v]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2020). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of schizophrenia, particularly in the context of managing drug side effects, the APA 2020 guidelines recommend considering the following options for patients experiencing parkinsonism as a result of antipsychotic therapy:

- **Lowering the dosage**: Reduce the dosage of the antipsychotic medication.
- **Switching medications**: Switch to another antipsychotic medication.
- **Anticholinergic treatment**: Treat with an anticholinergic medication.

### Movement disorders associated with atypical antipsychotic drugs [^1133GxDo]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

Data from clinical trials reviewed in this article fulfill predictions based on preclinical findings that atypical antipsychotic drugs are associated with a reduced potential for inducing extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) and other movement disorders. Atypical drugs have been shown to reduce all subtypes of acute EPS, the frequency of EPS-related patient dropouts, and the need for concomitant antiparkinsonian drug use. Clozapine remains superior to other atypicals in treating psychosis without worsening motor symptoms in patients with Parkinson's disease. Atypicals may be selectively advantageous in treating schizophrenic patients with a predisposition to catatonia. Although the risk of developing lethal neuroleptic malignant syndrome may be diminished with atypical drugs, clinicians must remain alert to the signs of this disorder. Atypicals have reduced liability for inducing tardive dyskinesia (TD) and show antidyskinetic properties in patients with preexisting TD. Passive resolution of TD may be facilitated in some patients by the use of these agents. Thus, the risk of movement disorders has become only one of several considerations in choosing among antipsychotic drugs.

### Use of antipsychotic drugs in dermatology [^112gRF1e]. Clinics in Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Antipsychotic drugs can be beneficial in dermatology because of their central nervous system and peripheral effects. All antipsychotic drugs have a central postsynaptic dopamine D2 receptor blocking effect, which underlies their antipsychotic action. The drugs have varying degrees of histamine H1-receptor, cholinergic muscarinic receptor, and α1-adrenergic receptor blocking effects, which can affect cutaneous perception and the autonomic reactivity of the skin. This can be potentially beneficial in the management of certain histamine or sympathetically mediated dermatologic manifestations (e.g. urticaria, pruritus, hyperhidrosis).

In addition to their antipsychotic effects, antipsychotic drugs also have a general anxiolytic effect, partly due to their α1-adrenergic receptor blocking action, which can benefit many dermatologic conditions, including pruritus. They are most commonly used in dermatology for managing delusional disorder (somatic type) manifesting as delusional infestation, as monotherapy, or as augmentation therapy of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants. They are also used for managing trichotillomania and skin-picking or excoriation disorder.

There is earlier literature on the possible beneficial effect of phenothiazine antipsychotics in a wide range of pruritic dermatoses and the efficacy of pimozide as adjunctive therapy for metastatic melanoma, both warranting further investigation.

### Antipsychotic dosing: How much but also how often [^111bg3Na]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2010). Low credibility.

Considerable focus has been devoted to determining how much antipsychotic medication is appropriate for optimal clinical response, although clarity on how often antipsychotics should be administered is still lacking. Clinicians are aware of the increased risk of relapse related to antipsychotic nonadherence or discontinuation. Practice dictates continuous antipsychotic exposure with the goal of achieving steady-state levels to maintain effectiveness and prevent relapse. Does this mean we need to, or should, administer antipsychotics at least daily? There is a body of evidence challenging this long-established clinical axiom.

### Switching antipsychotic therapy: what to expect and clinical strategies for improving therapeutic outcomes [^115sw5hH]. Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2007). Low credibility.

When a patient taking an antipsychotic is not experiencing symptomatic remission or is experiencing adverse effects (AEs) that are intolerable or damaging to their physical health, changing medication may be the best path to a good outcome. However, many clinicians are reluctant to switch medications except in the clearest cases of failure. This reluctance is intensified by the occurrence of AEs caused by transitioning patients too rapidly between agents with different receptor-binding profiles.

Emergent antipsychotic-switching syndromes include the "withdrawal triad", comprised of cholinergic rebound, supersensitivity psychosis, and emergent withdrawal dyskinesias (and other motor syndromes). More recently, another element has been observed, consistent with an activation syndrome. This activation syndrome may occur as a consequence of switching from highly sedative agents or as a consequence of initial prodopaminergic drive. All these effects can be minimized by careful planning of gradual switch procedures and judicious use of adjunctive medications.

### The effects of atypical antipsychotic medications on psychosocial outcomes [^112yWCjD]. Schizophrenia Research (2003). Low credibility.

This review examines the question — Do atypical antipsychotic medications improve psychosocial outcomes? — by examining studies that compared the effects of atypicals to conventional antipsychotics or to other atypical medications. The authors reviewed randomized clinical trials of atypical antipsychotic medication that included psychosocial variables as outcomes. Findings from 31 published studies on more than 12,000 individuals generally showed that atypical medications led to significant improvements in negative symptoms compared to conventional antipsychotics.

- **Global assessment of psychosocial functioning and quality of life**: Effects were mixed, with only about half the studies reporting significant improvements.

Olanzapine yielded the best results on psychosocial functioning; remoxipride was found to yield few significant changes on these variables. This review provides evidence that some atypical antipsychotics may have direct effects on some of the psychosocial disabilities that result from serious mental illness.

### Evidence-based guidelines for the pharmacological treatment of schizophrenia: Updated recommendations from the British Association for Psychopharmacology [^113jJpqe]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2020). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of schizophrenia, particularly the management of drug side effects, the BAP 2020 guidelines recommend against prescribing antimuscarinic agents prophylactically with antipsychotic medications. The need for antimuscarinic agents should be determined for emergent extrapyramidal symptoms, such as parkinsonism and acute dystonia, on an individual basis. This determination should consider the patient's history of extrapyramidal side effects and the risk of antimuscarinic side effects.

### "First do no harm". A systematic review of the prevalence and management of antipsychotic adverse effects [^114xHQ2s]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2015). Low credibility.

We aim to identify the prevalence and management strategies of nine clinically important categories of antipsychotic adverse effects: extrapyramidal symptoms, sedation, weight gain, type II diabetes, hyperprolactinaemia, metabolic syndrome, dyslipidaemia, sexual dysfunction, and cardiovascular effects.

Antipsychotic drugs are widely prescribed for schizophrenia and other mental disorders. The adverse effects of antipsychotics are common, with a potential negative impact on adherence and engagement. Despite this, the scientific study of the prevalence or management of adverse antipsychotic effects is a neglected area.

A systematic review was undertaken using pre-defined search criteria and three databases, with hand searching of citations and references. Inclusion was agreed on by two independent researchers after review of abstracts or full text. Quality analysis of included studies was conducted using pre-agreed criteria.

In total, 53 studies met inclusion criteria, revealing the following: (1) Antipsychotic polypharmacy was associated with increased frequency of adverse effects, and (2) a longer duration of treatment is associated with greater severity (e.g. higher BMI); (3) clozapine was more strongly associated with metabolic disturbance than other antipsychotics in three studies, and olanzapine was associated with the most weight gain in three studies; (4) hyperprolactinaemia was more common in women than men, but 50% of men noted sexual dysfunction versus 25–50% in women; (5) despite clinical guideline recommendations, there is insufficient guidance on managing these adverse effects.

### Antidepressant and antipsychotic side-effects and personalised prescribing: A systematic review and digital tool development [^114LVWo1]. The Lancet. Psychiatry (2023). High credibility.

To our knowledge, we have compiled the most comprehensive side-effect databases for antipsychotics and antidepressants at the time of writing, incorporating meta-analytic data for more than 65,000 people, alongside a synthesis of seven national or international guidelines for 69 drugs. Furthermore, for the first time to our knowledge, meta-analytic data were complemented by imputed results that were based on ordinal ranking scores, providing a compromise between the superior accuracy of meta-analytic results and broader drug coverage of guidelines.

Although the databases could be used in isolation to inform prescribing decisions, clinicians would still be faced with the challenge of simultaneously considering multiple side-effects for multiple drugs while also incorporating individual patient concerns. Our umbrella review highlighted the dilemma that often confronts clinicians and patients when making prescription decisions, whereby avoidance of one group of side-effects increases the risk of others (e.g. for antipsychotics, choosing drugs with a relatively low risk of weight gain and sedation results in the use of drugs with a relatively high risk of movement side-effects and hyperprolactinemia).

The Psymatik Treatment Optimizer aids in these challenges by facilitating evidence-based, personalised, and comprehensive antipsychotic and antidepressant prescribing decisions that are based on drug–side-effect profiles. Although an online tool exists that uses a traffic light system to rank medications on the basis of anticholinergic side-effects, to our knowledge, the Psymatik Treatment Optimizer provides a more nuanced approach.

### Metformin for the prevention of antipsychotic-induced weight gain: Guideline development and consensus validation [^1146EHFC]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for schizophrenia, particularly in addressing the side effects of medications, the AIWG-ICG 2024 guidelines recommend co-prescribing metformin with medium-risk antipsychotics, such as quetiapine, paliperidone, or risperidone, to prevent antipsychotic-induced weight gain. This is advised for patients with cardiometabolic risk factors or those aged 10–25 years.

### Prolactin elevation with antipsychotic medications: mechanisms of action and clinical consequences [^1153gHrT]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

Antipsychotic agents differ in efficacy and side effects, such as movement disorders and prolactin elevation, because of varying mechanisms of action. A revised nomenclature for antipsychotic agents, which categorizes the drugs according to efficacy, risk of movement disorders, and risk of prolactin elevation, is described.

Prolactin elevation, a potential side effect of some antipsychotic medications, is underdiagnosed but can have serious short-term and long-term consequences. Short-term problems include menstrual irregularities, sexual dysfunction, and depression. Long-term problems related to prolactin elevation include decreased bone density and osteoporosis, relapse of psychosis due to poor compliance resulting from sexual dysfunction or depression, and perhaps cancer, although more research in this area is needed.

Despite the serious nature of these effects, prolactin elevation is seldom detected because clinicians often fail to inquire about sexual function or other symptoms that signal elevated prolactin levels in a patient. These are issues that patients may not bring up with clinicians unless they are directly asked. Therefore, when patients are taking antipsychotic medications, clinicians should regularly inquire about sexual dysfunction, depression, menstrual disturbances, galactorrhea, and gynecomastia.

### The psychological consequences of the sedating side effects of antipsychotic medication: A systematic review [^114Trqvj]. Psychiatry Research (2025). Low credibility.

Sedation is a common side effect of antipsychotic medication. It is poorly defined but is generally understood to encompass excessive daytime sleepiness, difficulty thinking or concentrating, and oversleeping. Sedation is often cited as impacting functioning and well-being; however, no review at the time of writing has assessed this relationship.

- **Aims of review**: This review aims to explore the impact of the sedating side effects of antipsychotic medication on patient functioning and well-being.

- **Methods**: Papers were identified by searching the databases PubMed, PsycINFO, EBSCO, CINAHL, and Clarivate Web of Science. A narrative synthesis and quality appraisal were conducted.

- **Results**: Eleven peer-reviewed papers met the eligibility criteria. Sedation was often identified as the most common side effect but was not uniformly defined. Results consistently supported a negative effect of sedation on functioning (e.g. ability to perform day-to-day tasks and motivation). With respect to well-being, a negative impact of sedation was identified on quality of life and anhedonia, but there were less consistent interactions with other domains (e.g. anxiety), with few papers reporting on these links.

- **Conclusion**: Despite the plausible impact of sedation on patients being widely discussed, there is surprisingly little empirical research in this area. The research that exists broadly supports a negative impact of sedation on functioning and well-being, although there are some complexities requiring further investigation. Many domains (e.g. interaction with mood) have not been substantively investigated.

### Drugs and prolactin [^117CXxzL]. Pituitary (2008). Low credibility.

Medications commonly cause hyperprolactinemia, and their use must be differentiated from pathologic causes. The most common medications to cause hyperprolactinemia are the antipsychotic agents, although some of the newer atypical antipsychotics do not do so. Other medications causing hyperprolactinemia include antidepressants, antihypertensive agents, and drugs that increase bowel motility.

Often, medication-induced hyperprolactinemia is symptomatic, causing galactorrhea, menstrual disturbance, and erectile dysfunction. In the individual patient, it is important to differentiate hyperprolactinemia due to a medication from a structural lesion in the hypothalamic-pituitary area. This can be done by stopping the medication temporarily to determine if the prolactin (PRL) levels return to normal, switching to another medication in the same class that does not cause hyperprolactinemia (in consultation with the patient's physician and/or psychiatrist), or by performing an MRI or CT scan.

If the hyperprolactinemia is symptomatic, management strategies include switching to an alternative medication that does not cause hyperprolactinemia, using estrogen/testosterone replacement, or cautiously adding a dopamine agonist.

### Second-generation antipsychotic drugs and short-term somatic serious adverse events: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1176qUsW]. The Lancet Psychiatry (2019). Low credibility.

Antipsychotic drugs might cause acutely occurring, serious side effects and thus contribute to the increased physical morbidity and mortality observed in patients with severe mental health disorders. We examined this hypothesis by conducting a meta-analysis of International Conference on Harmonisation-Good Clinical Practice-defined serious adverse events occurring in placebo-controlled trials of antipsychotics.

- **Methods**: For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing second-generation antipsychotics with placebo. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL, BIOSIS, PsycINFO, PubMed, ClinicalTrials.gov, and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform for trials published in any language from database inception up until January 27, 2017. Trials were included without limitations in population (diagnostic category, age, sex, ethnicity), dosing regimen, blinding status, duration, or publication year. Only psychological studies lasting less than 1 day and trials conducted in mainland China were excluded. We contacted pharmaceutical companies, drug regulatory authorities, and study investigators for additional data. The primary outcome was the number of patients with at least one somatic serious adverse event. We estimated minimum and maximum numbers of patients with the outcome in each study group and synthesized the results with odds ratios (ORs) in a common-effects meta-analysis.

- **Findings**: We identified 597 RCTs, comprising 108,664 participants.

### Oral health impacts of medications used to treat mental illness [^112T3bjC]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

Many psychotropic medications affect oral health. This review identified oral side effects for antidepressant, antipsychotic, anticonvulsant, antianxiety, and sedative drugs that are recommended in Australia for the management of common mental illnesses and provides recommendations to manage these side effects.

- **Methods**: The Australian Therapeutic Guidelines and the Australian Medicines Handbook were searched for medications used to treat common mental health conditions. For each medication, the generic name, class, and drug company-reported side effects were extracted from the online Monthly Index of Medical Specialties (eMIMs) and UpToDate databases. Meyler's Side Effect of Drugs Encyclopaedia was used to identify additional oral adverse reactions to these medications.

- **Results**: Fifty-seven drugs were identified: 23 antidepressants, 22 antipsychotics or mood stabilizers, and 12 anxiolytic or sedative medications. Xerostomia (91%) was the most commonly reported side effect among all classes of medications of the 28 identified symptoms. Other commonly reported adverse effects included dysgeusia (65%) for antidepressants, and tardive dyskinesia (94%) or increased salivation (78%) for antipsychotic medications.

- **Conclusions**: While xerostomia has often been reported as a common adverse effect of psychotropic drugs, this review has identified additional side effects, including dysgeusia from antidepressants and tardive dyskinesia and increased salivation from antipsychotics. Clinicians should consider oral consequences of psychotropic medication in addition to other side effects.

### Management of common adverse effects of antipsychotic medications [^113XgCpt]. World Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

The benefits of antipsychotic medications are sometimes obscured by their adverse effects. These effects range from relatively minor tolerability issues, such as mild sedation or dry mouth, to very unpleasant issues like constipation, akathisia, and sexual dysfunction. They can also be painful, such as acute dystonias, disfiguring, like weight gain and tardive dyskinesia, or life-threatening, such as myocarditis and agranulocytosis. Importantly, adverse effect profiles are specific to each antipsychotic medication and do not neatly fit into first- and second-generation classifications.

This paper reviews management strategies for the most frequent side effects and identifies common principles intended to optimize net antipsychotic benefits. It is crucial to only use antipsychotics if the indication is clear and to continue them only if a benefit is discernible. If an antipsychotic is providing substantial benefit and the adverse effect is not life-threatening, the first management choice should be to lower the dose or adjust the dosing schedule. The next option is to change the antipsychotic, which is often reasonable unless the risk of relapse is high. In some instances, behavioral interventions can be tried.

Concomitant medications, though generally not desirable, are necessary in many instances and can provide considerable relief. Among concomitant medication strategies, anticholinergic medications for dystonias and parkinsonism are often effective. Beta-blockers and anticholinergic medications are useful for akathisia, and metformin may lead to slight to moderate weight loss.
