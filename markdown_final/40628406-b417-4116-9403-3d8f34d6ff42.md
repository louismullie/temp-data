## Question

Elevated alk phos bone

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about evaluating and managing an elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP) that is likely of bone origin. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming that the ALP elevation is indeed from bone rather than liver or other sources. Then, I should verify the magnitude of elevation and what thresholds matter clinically. Next, I will consider the major etiologies that drive bone ALP up, including Paget's disease, hyperparathyroidism, vitamin D deficiency, medications, and malignancy. After that, I need to outline a targeted diagnostic workup. Finally, I will synthesize management strategies tailored to the underlying cause, including bisphosphonates, denosumab, calcitonin, and monitoring plans, while double-checking safety issues like hypocalcemia and renal function throughout.

> Let me first confirm the source of the ALP elevation, because I need to ensure we are not missing liver or biliary disease masquerading as "bone" ALP. I should fractionate ALP into bone-specific and liver fractions, review GGT, ALT, and AST, and correlate with clinical context; if the bone fraction predominates and liver enzymes are normal, that supports a bone source, whereas a parallel rise in GGT/ALT/AST would redirect me to hepatobiliary evaluation. Wait, let me verify that I'm not overlooking pregnancy or adolescence, where placental or osteoblastic activity can raise total ALP; in those settings, isoenzyme analysis helps avoid misattribution. I should also remember that benign familial hyperphosphatasemia can cause persistent ALP elevation without disease, so a careful family history and isoenzyme pattern can prevent unnecessary workup [^116VC1qq].

> Next, I should review the degree of elevation, because magnitude guides urgency and differential. Mild elevations, up to about 1.5–2 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), can be seen with healing fractures, early hyperparathyroidism, or medication effects, whereas levels at or above 2× ULN push me to consider Paget's disease, bone metastases, or metabolic bone disease. Hold on, I should verify Paget's thresholds: multiple labels define moderate-to-severe Paget's as ALP at least 2× ULN, which aligns with when anti-resorptive therapy is typically indicated, so documenting this benchmark matters for treatment decisions [^114prU4f] [^1134VWqF] [^111FD53Y].

> I will now examine Paget's disease of bone, since it is a classic cause of markedly elevated bone ALP. Let me think about the pathophysiology: disordered osteoclast-mediated resorption followed by exuberant but disorganized osteoblast activity produces characteristic bone pain, deformity, and fracture risk, with ALP serving as a biochemical index of disease activity. I should confirm that ALP is typically at least 2× ULN in active disease and that bisphosphonates reliably suppress ALP, reflecting reduced turnover; indeed, alendronate 40 mg daily for 6 months achieves response in about 85% of patients, and zoledronic acid 5 mg IV once produces faster and more complete biochemical remission than oral risedronate in randomized trials [^114prU4f] [^notfound] [^1113GFeS].

> But wait, what if the ALP is driven by hyperparathyroidism rather than Paget's. I should check serum calcium, phosphorus, and intact PTH; in primary hyperparathyroidism, calcium is high or high-normal with suppressed phosphate and elevated or inappropriately normal PTH, and bone ALP may rise due to increased turnover. Hold on, I should verify medication contributors: levothyroxine over-replacement increases bone resorption and can elevate bone ALP with suppressed PTH, so I need to review thyroid dosing and labs carefully in this context [^1114wm4G] [^115fuHcC] [^116J5jHQ] [^1116PwvP] [^114SUXV4].

> I need to ensure I do not miss vitamin D deficiency and osteomalacia, which can elevate bone ALP through secondary hyperparathyroidism and increased osteoid formation. Let me first confirm 25-hydroxyvitamin D, calcium, phosphate, and PTH; low vitamin D with elevated PTH and low or low-normal calcium supports osteomalacia, and ALP often improves with vitamin D repletion. Wait, I should double-check for tenofovir-related proximal renal tubulopathy as a reversible cause of osteomalacia; if suspected, I should evaluate renal function, phosphate handling, and consider switching antiretrovirals while correcting vitamin D and phosphate [^114jRUSK] [^113CuZAr] [^113MSfZT] [^111RL4Ux] [^115tNrZT] [^116BhCii] [^111DAeMT].

> Let me consider medications that directly affect bone turnover and ALP. Teriparatide stimulates bone formation and predictably increases bone-specific ALP by roughly 40–45% in women and about 23% in men within months, so an expected rise on therapy is not pathological. Conversely, potent anti-resorptives like alendronate and zoledronic acid generally lower ALP as turnover falls; if ALP remains high despite therapy, I should reconsider adherence, absorption, or alternate diagnoses. I should also remember that asfotase alfa (Strensiq) elevates measured serum ALP due to drug interference, so ALP cannot be used to monitor bone disease in treated patients [^115f6amZ] [^1176Xron].

> Malignancy must be on the radar when ALP is markedly elevated, especially in older adults or those with concerning symptoms. I should confirm whether bone metastases are plausible and, if so, obtain a bone scan or PET/CT and consider tumor markers guided by primary tumor risk. Hold on, I should verify that denosumab and zoledronic acid are appropriate in this setting: both reduce skeletal-related events in solid tumor bone metastases, with denosumab noninferior or superior to zoledronic acid in multiple trials, so early involvement of oncology and bone-directed therapy is prudent [^114oaNKd] [^1148zJAA] [^114ZSHVd].

> Next, I should review a focused diagnostic workup once bone ALP is confirmed. I will now examine a bone-focused panel including calcium, phosphate, intact PTH, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, TSH and free T4, and renal function; if Paget's is suspected, I should add urinary N-telopeptide or serum CTX to corroborate high turnover, and if hyperparathyroidism is suspected, I should obtain 24-hour urine calcium to help distinguish primary from secondary causes. Let me verify imaging indications: plain radiographs of symptomatic bones can show cortical thickening and osteolysis in Paget's, bone scan helps detect polyostotic disease, and MRI delineates marrow and soft tissue involvement when complications are suspected [^1137nw4i].

> For management of Paget's disease, I should confirm that bisphosphonates are first-line. Alendronate 40 mg daily for 6 months achieves high response rates and improves bone pain, while zoledronic acid 5 mg IV once is superior to oral risedronate for speed and completeness of biochemical remission; I need to ensure calcium and vitamin D are adequate before and after therapy to mitigate hypocalcemia. Calcitonin is a reasonable alternative when bisphosphonates are contraindicated, though it is less potent and generally reserved for refractory or intolerant cases. I should double-check that ALP is monitored every 3–6 months initially to document response and guide retreatment if relapse occurs [^114prU4f] [^1137nw4i] [^1113GFeS] [^114rCAkw] [^112tRqhY].

> For osteoporosis with elevated bone turnover, I should confirm that anti-resorptives lower ALP and fracture risk. Alendronate 10 mg daily or 70 mg weekly reduces bone-specific ALP by about 15–30% and total ALP by 8–18%, with urinary resorption markers falling by roughly 60%, consistent with reduced turnover; zoledronic acid annually and denosumab every 6 months are alternatives, with denosumab particularly useful in renal impairment. Hold on, I should verify that we correct calcium and vitamin D and monitor for hypocalcemia, especially in patients with impaired renal function or low baseline calcium [^1115svf1] [^112yffNS] [^111FD53Y].

> For hyperparathyroidism, I need to ensure definitive therapy when indicated. Parathyroidectomy is curative for primary disease, while cinacalcet can be used when surgery is contraindicated; I should confirm that bone ALP declines after correction of hypercalcemia, reflecting reduced turnover. Wait, let me verify that secondary hyperparathyroidism from vitamin D deficiency requires repletion of vitamin D and calcium rather than parathyroid surgery, to avoid overtreatment [^notfound].

> For vitamin D deficiency and osteomalacia, I should confirm that repletion with cholecalciferol or ergocalciferol is done with close monitoring of calcium and phosphate, and that ALP typically normalizes over months as mineralization recovers. I need to check for underlying causes of malabsorption or renal phosphate wasting, and if tumor-induced osteomalacia is suspected, burosumab can normalize phosphate and improve bone health; dosing is individualized to maintain serum phosphorus in the normal range with monthly checks early on [^11729Ke5] [^1136cbgQ] [^117MYp9F].

> I should double-check medication-related contributors and adjust accordingly. If levothyroxine over-replacement is present, I should reduce the dose to the minimum effective level and recheck thyroid function and bone markers; if tenofovir-related renal phosphate wasting is suspected, I should consider switching antiretrovirals and correct phosphate and vitamin D. Let me reconsider any anabolic or anti-resorptive therapy timelines so I do not misinterpret expected marker changes as treatment failure [^1114wm4G] [^114jRUSK] [^113CuZAr] [^115f6amZ].

> Finally, I need to ensure follow-up and safety monitoring are explicit. After initiating anti-resorptives, I should check calcium and symptoms within 1–2 weeks, monitor ALP every 3–6 months until stable, and reassess fracture risk and BMD at 1–2 years. For Paget's, I should plan periodic ALP surveillance indefinitely given relapse risk, and for osteoporosis, I should re-evaluate the need for continued therapy at 3–5 years per label guidance. Hold on, I should verify that any new ALP rise prompts re-fractionation to avoid missing a superimposed liver process or new bone disease [^112tRqhY] [^111FD53Y].

An elevated bone alkaline phosphatase (ALP) reflects **increased osteoblast activity** from high bone turnover [^115f6amZ] or remodeling [^112Xfuna]. The most common causes are **Paget's disease, osteoporosis, bone metastases, and hyperparathyroidism**; less common causes include osteomalacia, renal osteodystrophy, and medications such as teriparatide or levothyroxine [^115f6amZ] [^1114wm4G]. Evaluation should include a **focused history, exam, and labs** (calcium, phosphate, PTH, 25(OH)D, liver enzymes, renal function) and imaging (plain films, bone scan, DXA) to identify the cause and guide therapy [^notfound]. Management targets the underlying disorder, with bisphosphonates or denosumab for high-turnover states, calcium/vitamin D for deficiency, and surgery or medical therapy for hyperparathyroidism; monitoring ALP helps track response and disease control [^114prU4f] [^114oaNKd] [^11729Ke5].

## Physiological role of bone alkaline phosphatase

Bone ALP is produced by osteoblasts and is essential for bone mineralization; **elevated levels indicate increased osteoblast activity** from higher bone turnover or remodeling [^115f6amZ].

## Clinical evaluation of elevated bone alkaline phosphatase

### History and physical examination

Assess **bone pain, fractures, deformities, and systemic symptoms** (fever, weight loss, hypercalcemia). Review medications, supplements, and family history of bone disease. On examination, look for bone tenderness, deformities, and signs of hypercalcemia or malignancy.

---

### Laboratory tests

- **Calcium and phosphate**: Evaluate for hyperparathyroidism, osteomalacia, renal osteodystrophy.
- **Parathyroid hormone (PTH)**: Differentiate primary vs secondary hyperparathyroidism.
- **25-hydroxyvitamin D**: Assess deficiency.
- **Liver enzymes**: Exclude hepatic causes of elevated ALP.
- **Renal function tests**: Evaluate renal osteodystrophy.

---

### Imaging studies

Obtain **plain radiographs** to detect Paget's disease, metastases, or fractures, and use a bone scan to identify metastases or Paget's lesions. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) assesses bone density and osteoporosis.

---

## Clinical significance and implications

Elevated bone ALP signals **active bone disease** and helps monitor treatment response and disease progression [^111DANLz]. Persistent elevation warrants evaluation for serious conditions such as metastases or metabolic bone disease [^116VC1qq].

---

## Management strategies

Management targets the **underlying cause**:

- **Paget's disease**: Bisphosphonates (e.g. alendronate, zoledronic acid) reduce bone turnover and ALP [^114prU4f] [^1137nw4i].
- **Osteoporosis**: Antiresorptives (bisphosphonates, denosumab) lower bone turnover and ALP [^112yffNS].
- **Hyperparathyroidism**: Parathyroidectomy or calcimimetics reduce bone turnover [^notfound].
- **Osteomalacia**: Vitamin D and calcium supplementation correct deficiency and normalize ALP [^notfound].
- **Medication-induced**: Adjust or discontinue offending drugs when possible [^1114wm4G].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Track **ALP at regular intervals** to assess response and disease activity [^111DANLz]. Combine with clinical assessment and imaging to guide ongoing management and detect complications.

---

Elevated bone ALP reflects increased osteoblast activity from high bone turnover; **identifying the cause enables targeted therapy** and ALP monitoring to track response and disease control [^115f6amZ].

### Alendronate sodium tablet (alendronate) [^1115svf1]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In clinical studies of up to two years' duration, alendronate 5 and 10 mg/day reduced cross-linked N- telopeptides of type I collagen (a marker of bone resorption) by approximately 60% and reduced bone- specific alkaline phosphatase and total serum alkaline phosphatase (markers of bone formation) by approximately 15 to 30% and 8 to 18%, respectively. As a result of inhibition of bone resorption, alendronate 5 and 10 mg/day induced asymptomatic decreases in serum calcium (approximately 1 to 2%) and serum phosphate (approximately 1 to 8%).

Paget's Disease of Bone

Paget's disease of bone is a chronic, focal skeletal disorder characterized by greatly increased and disorderly bone remodeling. Excessive osteoclastic bone resorption is followed by osteoblastic new bone formation, leading to the replacement of the normal bone architecture by disorganized, enlarged, and weakened bone structure.

Clinical manifestations of Paget's disease range from no symptoms to severe morbidity due to bone pain, bone deformity, pathological fractures, and neurological and other complications. Serum alkaline phosphatase, the most frequently used biochemical index of disease activity, provides an objective measure of disease severity and response to therapy.

Alendronate sodium decreases the rate of bone resorption directly, which leads to an indirect decrease in bone formation. In clinical trials, alendronate 40 mg once daily for six months produced significant decreases in serum alkaline phosphatase as well as in urinary markers of bone collagen degradation. As a result of the inhibition of bone resorption, alendronate sodium induced generally mild, transient, and asymptomatic decreases in serum calcium and phosphate.

### Calcitonin salmon (Miacalcin) [^114rCAkw]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

14.1	Paget's Disease of Bone

The trials used for the basis of approval for calcitonin salmon injection for treatment of Paget's disease of bone were conducted in patients with moderate to severe disease characterized by polyostotic involvement with elevated serum alkaline phosphatase and urinary hydroxyproline excretion. In open-label clinical trials of several months to two years duration with historical controls, biochemical abnormalities were substantially improved (more than 30% reduction) in about 2/3 of patients studied and bone pain was improved in a similar fraction. A small number of documented instances of reversal of neurologic deficits have occurred, including improvement in the basilar compression syndrome, and improvement of spinal cord and spinal nerve lesions. There is too little experience to predict the likelihood of improvement of any given neurologic lesion. Hearing loss is improved infrequently (4 of 29 patients studied by audiometry). Patients with increased cardiac output due to extensive Paget's disease of bone have had measured decreases in cardiac output while receiving calcitonin salmon. The number of treated patients in this category is too small to predict how likely such a result will be.

There is no evidence that the prophylactic use of calcitonin salmon is beneficial in asymptomatic patients.

14.2	Hypercalcemia

In four open-label clinical trials enrolling 53 patients, calcitonin salmon has been shown to lower elevated serum calcium levels of patients with carcinoma (with or without metastases), multiple myeloma, and primary hyperparathyroidism (lesser response). These patients were treated with calcitonin salmon only when other methods of lowering serum calcium (hydration, oral phosphate, corticosteroids) were unsuccessful or unsuitable. With patients' pre-therapy serum calcium levels as controls, reduction in serum calcium was evident within 1 to 2 hours of administration. The peak effect occurred within 24 to 48 hours of injection and administration of calcitonin salmon every 12 hours maintained a hypocalcemic effect for approximately 5 to 8 days, the time period evaluated for most patients in the clinical trials. The average reduction of 8-hour post-injection serum calcium was approximately 9% (2 to 3 mg/dL). Patients with higher values of serum calcium tended to show greater reductions during calcitonin salmon treatment.

### Zoledronic acid (reclast) [^111FD53Y]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

1.1 Treatment of Osteoporosis in Postmenopausal Women

Reclast is indicated for treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. In postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, diagnosed by bone mineral density (BMD) or prevalent vertebral fracture, Reclast reduces the incidence of fractures (hip, vertebral, and non-vertebral osteoporosis-related fractures). In patients at high risk of fracture, defined as a recent low-trauma hip fracture, Reclast reduces the incidence of new clinical fractures [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

1.2 Prevention of Osteoporosis in Postmenopausal Women

Reclast is indicated for prevention of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

1.3 Osteoporosis in Men

Reclast is indicated for treatment to increase bone mass in men with osteoporosis [see Clinical Studies (14.3)].

1.4 Glucocorticoid-Induced Osteoporosis

Reclast is indicated for the treatment and prevention of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis in men and women who are either initiating or continuing systemic glucocorticoids in a daily dosage equivalent to 7.5 mg or greater of prednisone and who are expected to remain on glucocorticoids for at least 12 months [see Clinical Studies (14.4)].

1.5 Paget's Disease of Bone

Reclast is indicated for treatment of Paget's disease of bone in men and women. Treatment is indicated in patients with Paget's disease of bone with elevations in serum alkaline phosphatase of two times or higher than the upper limit of the age-specific normal reference range, or those who are symptomatic, or those at risk for complications from their disease [see Clinical Studies (14.5)].

1.6 Important Limitations of Use

The safety and effectiveness of Reclast for the treatment of osteoporosis is based on clinical data of three years duration. The optimal duration of use has not been determined. All patients on bisphosphonate therapy should have the need for continued therapy reevaluated on a periodic basis. Patients at low-risk for fracture should be considered for drug discontinuation after 3 to 5 years of use. Patients who discontinue therapy should have their risk for fracture reevaluated periodically.

### Risedronate sodium [^111insLy]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Figure 6 Mean Percent Change from Baseline in Serum Alkaline Phosphatase Excess by Visit

Response to risedronate sodium therapy was similar in patients with mild to very severe Paget's disease. Table 6 shows the mean percent reduction from baseline at Day 180 in excess serum alkaline phosphatase in patients with mild, moderate, or severe disease.

Response to risedronate sodium therapy was similar between patients who had previously received anti-pagetic therapy and those who had not. In the active-controlled study, 4 patients previously non-responsive to 1 or more courses of anti-pagetic therapy (calcitonin, Didronel) responded to treatment with risedronate sodium tablets 30 mg daily (defined by at least a 30% change from baseline). Each of these patients achieved at least 90% reduction from baseline in serum alkaline phosphatase excess, with 3 patients achieving normalization of serum alkaline phosphatase levels.

Histomorphometry of the bone was studied in 14 patients with bone biopsies: 9 patients had biopsies from pagetic bone lesions and 5 patients from non-pagetic bone. Bone biopsy results in non-pagetic bone did not reveal osteomalacia, impairment of bone remodeling, or induction of a significant decline in bone turnover in patients treated with risedronate sodium tablets.

### Alendronate sodium (Fosamax) [^114prU4f]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

14.5	Treatment of Paget's Disease of Bone

The efficacy of FOSAMAX 40 mg once daily for six months was demonstrated in two double-blind clinical studies of male and female patients with moderate to severe Paget's disease (alkaline phosphatase at least twice the upper limit of normal): a placebo-controlled, multinational study and a U.S. comparative study with etidronate disodium 400 mg/day. Figure 6 shows the mean percent changes from baseline in serum alkaline phosphatase for up to six months of randomized treatment.

Figure 6:

At six months the suppression in alkaline phosphatase in patients treated with FOSAMAX was significantly greater than that achieved with etidronate and contrasted with the complete lack of response in placebo-treated patients. Response (defined as either normalization of serum alkaline phosphatase or decrease from baseline greater than or equal to 60%) occurred in approximately 85% of patients treated with FOSAMAX in the combined studies vs. 30% in the etidronate group and 0% in the placebo group. FOSAMAX was similarly effective regardless of age, gender, race, prior use of other bisphosphonates, or baseline alkaline phosphatase within the range studied (at least twice the upper limit of normal).

Bone histology was evaluated in 33 patients with Paget's disease treated with FOSAMAX 40 mg/day for 6 months. As in patients treated for osteoporosis [see Clinical Studies (14.1)], FOSAMAX did not impair mineralization, and the expected decrease in the rate of bone turnover was observed. Normal lamellar bone was produced during treatment with FOSAMAX, even where preexisting bone was woven and disorganized. Overall, bone histology data support the conclusion that bone formed during treatment with FOSAMAX is of normal quality.

Figure 6

Mean Percent Change from Baseline in Serum Alkaline Phosphatase Excess by Visit

Response to ACTONEL therapy was similar in patients with mild to very severe Paget's disease. Table 6 shows the mean percent reduction from baseline at Day 180 in excess serum alkaline phosphatase in patients with mild, moderate, or severe disease.

Response to ACTONEL therapy was similar between patients who had previously received anti-pagetic therapy and those who had not. In the active-controlled study, 4 patients previously non-responsive to 1 or more courses of anti-pagetic therapy (calcitonin, Didronel) responded to treatment with ACTONEL 30 mg daily (defined by at least a 30% change from baseline). Each of these patients achieved at least 90% reduction from baseline in serum alkaline phosphatase excess, with 3 patients achieving normalization of serum alkaline phosphatase levels.

Histomorphometry of the bone was studied in 14 patients with bone biopsies: 9 patients had biopsies from pagetic bone lesions and 5 patients from non-pagetic bone. Bone biopsy results in non-pagetic bone did not reveal osteomalacia, impairment of bone remodeling, or induction of a significant decline in bone turnover in patients treated with ACTONEL.

### Zoledronic acid (reclast) [^1137nw4i]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

14.5 Treatment of Paget's Disease of Bone

Reclast was studied in male and female patients with moderate to severe Paget's disease of bone, defined as serum alkaline phosphatase level at least twice the upper limit of the age-specific normal reference range at the time of study entry. Diagnosis was confirmed by radiographic evidence.

The efficacy of one infusion of 5 mg Reclast vs. oral daily doses of 30 mg risedronate for 2 months was demonstrated in two identically designed 6-month randomized, double-blind trials. The mean age of patients in the two trials was 70. Ninety-three percent (93%) of patients were Caucasian. Therapeutic response was defined as either normalization of serum alkaline phosphatase (SAP) or a reduction of at least 75% from baseline in total SAP excess at the end of 6 months. SAP excess was defined as the difference between the measured level and midpoint of normal range.

In both trials, Reclast demonstrated a superior and more rapid therapeutic response compared with risedronate and returned more patients to normal levels of bone turnover, as evidenced by biochemical markers of formation (SAP, serum N-terminal propeptide of type I collagen [P1NP]) and resorption (serum CTx 1 [cross-linked C-telopeptides of type I collagen] and urine α-CTx).

### Alendronate sodium (alendronate) [^112Xfuna]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Osteoporosis in Men

Treatment of men with osteoporosis with alendronate 10 mg/day for two years reduced urinary excretion of cross-linked N-telopeptides of type I collagen by approximately 60% and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase by approximately 40%. Similar reductions were observed in a one-year study in men with osteoporosis receiving once weekly alendronate 70 mg.

Glucocorticoid-Induced Osteoporosis

Sustained use of glucocorticoids is commonly associated with development of osteoporosis and resulting fractures (especially vertebral, hip, and rib). It occurs both in males and females of all ages. Osteoporosis occurs as a result of inhibited bone formation and increased bone resorption resulting in net bone loss. Alendronate decreases bone resorption without directly inhibiting bone formation.

In clinical studies of up to two years' duration, alendronate 5 and 10 mg/day reduced cross-linked N-telopeptides of type I collagen (a marker of bone resorption) by approximately 60% and reduced bone-specific alkaline phosphatase and total serum alkaline phosphatase (markers of bone formation) by approximately 15 to 30% and 8 to 18%, respectively. As a result of inhibition of bone resorption, alendronate 5 and 10 mg/day induced asymptomatic decreases in serum calcium (approximately 1 to 2%) and serum phosphate (approximately 1 to 8%).

Paget's Disease of Bone

Paget's disease of bone is a chronic, focal skeletal disorder characterized by greatly increased and disorderly bone remodeling. Excessive osteoclastic bone resorption is followed by osteoblastic new bone formation, leading to the replacement of the normal bone architecture by disorganized, enlarged, and weakened bone structure.

Clinical manifestations of Paget's disease range from no symptoms to severe morbidity due to bone pain, bone deformity, pathological fractures, and neurological and other complications. Serum alkaline phosphatase, the most frequently used biochemical index of disease activity, provides an objective measure of disease severity and response to therapy.

Alendronate sodium decreases the rate of bone resorption directly, which leads to an indirect decrease in bone formation. In clinical trials, alendronate sodium 40 mg once daily for six months produced significant decreases in serum alkaline phosphatase as well as in urinary markers of bone collagen degradation. As a result of the inhibition of bone resorption, alendronate sodium induced generally mild, transient, and asymptomatic decreases in serum calcium and phosphate.

Osteoporosis in Men

Treatment of men with osteoporosis with FOSAMAX 10 mg/day for two years reduced urinary excretion of cross-linked N-telopeptides of type I collagen by approximately 60% and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase by approximately 40%. Similar reductions were observed in a one-year study in men with osteoporosis receiving once weekly FOSAMAX 70 mg.

Glucocorticoid-Induced Osteoporosis

Sustained use of glucocorticoids is commonly associated with development of osteoporosis and resulting fractures (especially vertebral, hip, and rib). It occurs both in males and females of all ages. Osteoporosis occurs as a result of inhibited bone formation and increased bone resorption resulting in net bone loss. Alendronate decreases bone resorption without directly inhibiting bone formation.

In clinical studies of up to two years' duration, FOSAMAX 5 and 10 mg/day reduced cross-linked N-telopeptides of type I collagen (a marker of bone resorption) by approximately 60% and reduced bone-specific alkaline phosphatase and total serum alkaline phosphatase (markers of bone formation) by approximately 15 to 30% and 8 to 18%, respectively. As a result of inhibition of bone resorption, FOSAMAX 5 and 10 mg/day induced asymptomatic decreases in serum calcium (approximately 1 to 2%) and serum phosphate (approximately 1 to 8%).

### Risedronate sodium (Actonel) [^1134VWqF]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

14.5 Treatment of Paget's Disease

The efficacy of ACTONEL was demonstrated in 2 clinical studies involving 120 men and 65 women. In a double-blind, active-controlled study of patients with moderate-to-severe Paget's disease (serum alkaline phosphatase levels of at least 2 times the upper limit of normal), patients were treated with ACTONEL 30 mg daily for 2 months or Didronel (etidronate disodium) 400 mg daily for 6 months. At Day 180, 77% (43/56) of ACTONEL-treated patients achieved normalization of serum alkaline phosphatase levels, compared to 10.5% (6/57) of patients treated with Didronel (p less than 0.001). At Day 540, 16 months after discontinuation of therapy, 53% (17/32) of ACTONEL-treated patients and 14% (4/29) of Didronel-treated patients with available data remained in biochemical remission.

During the first 180 days of the active-controlled study, 85% (51/60) of ACTONEL-treated patients demonstrated a greater than or equal to 75% reduction from baseline in serum alkaline phosphatase excess (difference between measured level and midpoint of the normal range) with 2 months of treatment compared to 20% (12/60) in the Didronel-treated group with 6 months of treatment (p less than 0.001). Changes in serum alkaline phosphatase excess over time (shown in Figure 6) were significant following only 30 days of treatment, with a 36% reduction in serum alkaline phosphatase excess at that time compared to only a 6% reduction seen with Didronel treatment at the same time point (p less than 0.01).

### Parathyroid hormone — Natpara — parathyroid hormone [^115VxWcA]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

WARNING: POTENTIAL RISK OF OSTEOSARCOMA

In male and female rats, parathyroid hormone caused an increase in the incidence of osteosarcoma (a malignant bone tumor). The occurrence of osteosarcoma was dependent on parathyroid hormone dose and treatment duration. This effect was observed at parathyroid hormone exposure levels ranging from 3 to 71 times the exposure levels in humans receiving a 100 mcg dose of NATPARA. These data could not exclude a risk to humans [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].
Because of a potential risk of osteosarcoma, use NATPARA only in patients who cannot be well-controlled on calcium and active forms of vitamin D alone and for whom the potential benefits are considered to outweigh this potential risk [see Indications and Usage (1), Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
Avoid use of NATPARA in patients who are at increased baseline risk for osteosarcoma, such as patients with Paget's disease of bone or unexplained elevations of alkaline phosphatase, pediatric and young adult patients with open epiphyses, patients with hereditary disorders predisposing to osteosarcoma or patients with a prior history of external beam or implant radiation therapy involving the skeleton [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
Because of the risk of osteosarcoma, NATPARA is available only through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) called the NATPARA REMS Program [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

WARNING: POTENTIAL RISK OF OSTEOSARCOMA

See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning.

In male and female rats, parathyroid hormone caused an increase in the incidence of osteosarcoma (a malignant bone tumor) that was dependent on dose and treatment duration. A risk to humans could not be excluded (5.1, 13.1)
Because of the potential risk of osteosarcoma, prescribe NATPARA only to patients who cannot be well-controlled on calcium and active forms of vitamin D and for whom the potential benefits are considered to outweigh the potential risk. (1, 5.1)

### Calcitonin salmon (Miacalcin) [^116UjeYQ]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Miacalcin synthetic injection is a calcitonin, indicated for the following conditions:

Treatment of symptomatic Paget's disease of bone when alternative treatments are not suitable (1.1)
Treatment of hypercalcemia (1.2)
Treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis when alternative treatments are not suitable. Fracture reduction efficacy has not been demonstrated (1.3)

Limitations of Use:

Due to the possible association between malignancy and calcitonin salmon use, the need for continued therapy should be re-evaluated on a periodic basis (1.4, 5.3)

1.1	Treatment of Paget's Disease of Bone

Miacalcin injection is indicated for the treatment of symptomatic Paget's disease of bone in patients with moderate to severe disease characterized by polyostotic involvement with elevated serum alkaline phosphatase and urinary hydroxyproline excretion. There is no evidence that the prophylactic use of calcitonin salmon is beneficial in asymptomatic patients. Miacalcin injection should be used only in patients who do not respond to alternative treatments or for whom such treatments are not suitable (e.g., patients for whom other therapies are contraindicated or for patients who are intolerant or unwilling to use other therapies).

1.2	Treatment of Hypercalcemia

Miacalcin injection is indicated for the early treatment of hypercalcemic emergencies, along with other appropriate agents, when a rapid decrease in serum calcium is required, until more specific treatment of the underlying disease can be accomplished. It may also be added to existing therapeutic regimens for hypercalcemia such as intravenous fluids and furosemide, oral phosphate or corticosteroids, or other agents.

1.3	Treatment of Postmenopausal Osteoporosis

Miacalcin injection is indicated for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis in women greater than 5 years postmenopause. The evidence of efficacy for calcitonin salmon injection is based on increases in total body calcium observed in clinical trials. Fracture reduction efficacy has not been demonstrated. Miacalcin injection should be reserved for patients for whom alternative treatments are not suitable (e.g., patients for whom other therapies are contraindicated or for patients who are intolerant or unwilling to use other therapies).

1.4	Important Limitations of Use

Due to the possible association between malignancy and calcitonin salmon use, the need for continued therapy should be re-evaluated on a periodic basis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

### Exemestane [^112ETf5d]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.4 Laboratory Abnormalities

In patients with early breast cancer, the incidence of hematological abnormalities of Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) grade ≥ 1 was lower in the exemestane treatment group, compared with tamoxifen. Incidence of CTC grade 3 or 4 abnormalities was low (approximately 0.1%) in both treatment groups. Approximately 20% of patients receiving exemestane in clinical studies in advanced breast cancer experienced CTC grade 3 or 4 lymphocytopenia. Of these patients, 89% had a pre-existing lower grade lymphopenia. Forty percent of patients either recovered or improved to a lesser severity while on treatment. Patients did not have a significant increase in viral infections, and no opportunistic infections were observed. Elevations of serum levels of AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, and gamma glutamyl transferase > 5 times the upper value of the normal range (i.e., ≥ CTC grade 3) have been rarely reported in patients treated for advanced breast cancer but appear mostly attributable to the underlying presence of liver and/or bone metastases. In the comparative study in advanced breast cancer patients, CTC grade 3 or 4 elevation of gamma glutamyl transferase without documented evidence of liver metastasis was reported in 2.7% of patients treated with exemestane and in 1.8% of patients treated with megestrol acetate.

In patients with early breast cancer, elevations in bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, and creatinine were more common in those receiving exemestane than either tamoxifen or placebo. Treatment-emergent bilirubin elevations (any CTC grade) occurred in 5% of exemestane patients and 0.8% of tamoxifen patients on the Intergroup Exemestane Study (IES), and in 7% of exemestane treated patients vs. 0% of placebo treated patients in the 027 study. CTC grade 3 to 4 increases in bilirubin occurred in 0.9% of exemestane treated patients compared to 0.1% of tamoxifen treated patients. Alkaline phosphatase elevations of any CTC grade occurred in 15% of exemestane treated patients on the IES compared to 2.6% of tamoxifen treated patients, and in 14% of exemestane treated patients compared to 7% of placebo treated patients in study 027. Creatinine elevations occurred in 6% of exemestane treated patients and 4.3% of tamoxifen treated patients on the IES and in 6% of exemestane treated patients and 0% of placebo treated patients in study 027.

5.5 Use in Premenopausal Women

Exemestane is not indicated for the treatment of breast cancer in premenopausal women.

### Alendronate sodium (Fosamax) [^112tRqhY]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.2	Mineral Metabolism

Hypocalcemia must be corrected before initiating therapy with FOSAMAX [see Contraindications (4)]. Other disorders affecting mineral metabolism (such as vitamin D deficiency) should also be effectively treated. In patients with these conditions, serum calcium and symptoms of hypocalcemia should be monitored during therapy with FOSAMAX.

Presumably due to the effects of FOSAMAX on increasing bone mineral, small, asymptomatic decreases in serum calcium and phosphate may occur, especially in patients with Paget's disease, in whom the pretreatment rate of bone turnover may be greatly elevated, and in patients receiving glucocorticoids, in whom calcium absorption may be decreased.

Ensuring adequate calcium and vitamin D intake is especially important in patients with Paget's disease of bone and in patients receiving glucocorticoids.

5.3	Musculoskeletal Pain

In post-marketing experience, severe and occasionally incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain has been reported in patients taking bisphosphonates that are approved for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. This category of drugs includes FOSAMAX (alendronate). Most of the patients were postmenopausal women. The time to onset of symptoms varied from one day to several months after starting the drug. Discontinue use if severe symptoms develop. Most patients had relief of symptoms after stopping. A subset had recurrence of symptoms when rechallenged with the same drug or another bisphosphonate.

In placebo-controlled clinical studies of FOSAMAX, the percentages of patients with these symptoms were similar in the FOSAMAX and placebo groups.

### Pamidronate disodium [^117VrKJ7]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

No statistically significant differences between treatment groups, or statistically significant changes from baseline were observed for the bone pain response, mobility, and global evaluation in the 45 mg and 90 mg groups. Improvement in radiologic lesions occurred in some patients in the 90 mg group.

Twenty-five patients who had Paget's disease were retreated with 90 mg of pamidronate disodium. Of these, 44% had a ≥ 50% decrease in serum alkaline phosphatase from baseline after treatment, and 39% had a ≥ 50% decrease in urine hydroxyproline/creatinine ratio from baseline after treatment.

Osteolytic Bone Metastases of Breast Cancer and Osteolytic Lesions of Multiple Myeloma

Osteolytic bone metastases commonly occur in patients with multiple myeloma or breast cancer. These cancers demonstrate a phenomenon known as osteotropism, meaning they possess an extraordinary affinity for bone. The distribution of osteolytic bone metastases in these cancers is predominantly in the axial skeleton, particularly the spine, pelvis, and ribs, rather than the appendicular skeleton, although lesions in the proximal femur and humerus are not uncommon. This distribution is similar to the red bone marrow in which slow blood flow possibly assists attachment of metastatic cells. The surface-to-volume ratio of trabecular bone is much higher than cortical bone, and therefore disease processes tend to occur more floridly in trabecular bone than at sites of cortical tissue.

In the comparative study in advanced breast cancer patients, CTC grade 3 or 4 elevation of gamma glutamyl transferase without documented evidence of liver metastasis was reported in 2.7% of patients treated with AROMASIN and in 1.8% of patients treated with megestrol acetate.

In patients with early breast cancer, elevations in bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, and creatinine were more common in those receiving exemestane than either tamoxifen or placebo. Treatment-emergent bilirubin elevations (any CTC grade) occurred in 5% of exemestane patients and 0.8% of tamoxifen patients on the Intergroup Exemestane Study (IES), and in 7% of exemestane treated patients vs. 0% of placebo treated patients in the 027 study.

### Seladelpar lysine (Livdelzi) [^113XkeMc]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Fractures: Consider the risk of fracture in patients treated with LIVDELZI. Monitor bone health according to current standards of care. (5.1)
Liver Test Abnormalities: Obtain baseline clinical and laboratory liver assessments prior to starting LIVDELZI and monitor during treatment. Interrupt or discontinue LIVDELZI if the liver tests worsen. (5.2)
Biliary Obstruction: Avoid use in patients with complete biliary obstruction. If biliary obstruction is suspected, interrupt LIVDELZI and treat as clinically indicated. (5.3)

5.1	Fractures

Fractures occurred in 4% of LIVDELZI-treated patients compared to no placebo-treated patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Consider the risk of fracture in the care of patients treated with LIVDELZI and monitor bone health according to current standards of care.

5.2	Liver Test Abnormalities

LIVDELZI has been associated with dose-related increases in serum transaminase (aspartate aminotransferase [AST] and alanine aminotransferase [ALT]) levels greater than 3-times upper limit of normal (ULN) in PBC patients receiving 50 mg once daily (5-times higher than the recommended dosage) and 200 mg (20-times higher than the recommended dosage) once daily. Transaminase levels returned to pretreatment levels upon LIVDELZI discontinuation. LIVDELZI 10 mg once daily did not show a similar pattern for increases in transaminase levels [see Overdosage (10)].

Obtain baseline clinical and laboratory assessments at treatment initiation with LIVDELZI and monitor thereafter according to routine patient management. Interrupt LIVDELZI treatment if the liver tests (ALT, AST, total bilirubin [TB], and/or alkaline phosphatase [ALP]) worsen, or the patient develops signs and symptoms consistent with clinical hepatitis (e.g., jaundice, right upper quadrant pain, eosinophilia). Consider permanent discontinuation if liver tests worsen after restarting LIVDELZI.

5.3 	Biliary Obstruction

Avoid use of LIVDELZI in patients with complete biliary obstruction. If biliary obstruction is suspected, interrupt LIVDELZI and treat as clinically indicated.

### Teriparatide [^115f6amZ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Effects on Markers of Bone Turnover — Daily administration of teriparatide injection to men and postmenopausal women with osteoporosis in clinical studies stimulated bone formation, as shown by increases in the formation markers serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP) and procollagen I carboxy-terminal propeptide (PICP). Data on biochemical markers of bone turnover were available for the first 12 months of treatment. Peak concentrations of PICP at 1 month of treatment were approximately 41% above baseline, followed by a decline to near-baseline values by 12 months. BSAP concentrations increased by 1 month of treatment and continued to rise more slowly from 6 through 12 months. The maximum increases of BSAP were 45% above baseline in women and 23% in men. After discontinuation of therapy, BSAP concentrations returned toward baseline. The increases in formation markers were accompanied by secondary increases in the markers of bone resorption: urinary N-telopeptide (NTX) and urinary deoxypyridinoline (DPD), consistent with the physiological coupling of bone formation and resorption in skeletal remodeling. Changes in BSAP, NTX, and DPD were lower in men than in women, possibly because of lower systemic exposure to teriparatide in men.

In the study of patients with glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis, the effects of teriparatide injection on serum markers of bone turnover were similar to those observed in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis not taking glucocorticoids.

### Zoledronic acid (reclast) [^1113GFeS]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

The 6-month combined data from both trials showed that 96% (169/176) of Reclast-treated patients achieved a therapeutic response as compared with 74% (127/171) of patients treated with risedronate. Most Reclast patients achieved a therapeutic response by the Day 63 visit. In addition, at 6 months, 89% (156/176) of Reclast-treated patients achieved normalization of SAP levels, compared to 58% (99/171) of patients treated with risedronate (p < 0.0001) (see Figure 2).

The therapeutic response to Reclast was similar across demographic and disease-severity groups defined by gender, age, previous bisphosphonate use, and disease severity. At 6 months, the percentage of Reclast-treated patients who achieved therapeutic response was 97% and 95%, respectively, in each of the baseline disease severity subgroups (baseline SAP less than 3xULN, greater than or equal to 3xULN) compared to 75% and 74%, respectively, for the same disease severity subgroups of risedronate-treated patients.

In patients who had previously received treatment with oral bisphosphonates, therapeutic response rates were 96% and 55% for Reclast and risedronate, respectively. The comparatively low risedronate response was due to the low response rate (7/23, 30%) in patients previously treated with risedronate. In patients naïve to previous treatment, a greater therapeutic response was also observed with Reclast (98%) relative to risedronate (86%). In patients with symptomatic pain at screening, therapeutic response rates were 94% and 70% for Reclast and risedronate, respectively. For patients without pain at screening, therapeutic response rates were 100% and 82% for Reclast and risedronate, respectively.

Bone histology was evaluated in 7 patients with Paget's disease 6 months after being treated with Reclast 5 mg. Bone biopsy results showed bone of normal quality with no evidence of impaired bone remodeling and no evidence of mineralization defect.

### Alendronate sodium [^112yffNS]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Daily oral doses of alendronate (5, 20, and 40 mg for six weeks) in postmenopausal women produced biochemical changes indicative of dose-dependent inhibition of bone resorption, including decreases in urinary calcium and urinary markers of bone collagen degradation (such as deoxypyridinoline and crosslinked N-telopeptides of type I collagen). These biochemical changes tended to return toward baseline values as early as 3 weeks following the discontinuation of therapy with alendronate and did not differ from placebo after 7 months.

Long-term treatment of osteoporosis with alendronate sodium 10 mg/day (for up to five years) reduced urinary excretion of markers of bone resorption, deoxypyridinoline and cross-linked N-telopeptides of type I collagen, by approximately 50% and 70%, respectively, to reach levels similar to those seen in healthy premenopausal women. Similar decreases were seen in patients in osteoporosis prevention studies who received alendronate sodium 5 mg/day. The decrease in the rate of bone resorption indicated by these markers was evident as early as one month and at three to six months reached a plateau that was maintained for the entire duration of treatment with alendronate sodium. In osteoporosis treatment studies alendronate sodium 10 mg/day decreased the markers of bone formation, osteocalcin and bone specific alkaline phosphatase by approximately 50%, and total serum alkaline phosphatase by approximately 25 to 30% to reach a plateau after 6 to 12 months. In osteoporosis prevention studies alendronate sodium 5 mg/day decreased osteocalcin and total serum alkaline phosphatase by approximately 40% and 15%, respectively. Similar reductions in the rate of bone turnover were observed in postmenopausal women during one-year studies with once weekly alendronate sodium 70 mg for the treatment of osteoporosis and once weekly alendronate sodium 35 mg for the prevention of osteoporosis. These data indicate that the rate of bone turnover reached a new steady-state, despite the progressive increase in the total amount of alendronate deposited within bone.

These biochemical changes tended to return toward baseline values as early as 3 weeks following the discontinuation of therapy with alendronate and did not differ from placebo after 7 months.

Long-term treatment of osteoporosis with alendronate 10 mg/day (for up to five years) reduced urinary excretion of markers of bone resorption, deoxypyridinoline and cross-linked N-telopeptides of type l collagen, by approximately 50% and 70%, respectively, to reach levels similar to those seen in healthy premenopausal women. Similar decreases were seen in patients in osteoporosis prevention studies who received alendronate 5 mg/day. The decrease in the rate of bone resorption indicated by these markers was evident as early as one month and at three to six months reached a plateau that was maintained for the entire duration of treatment with alendronate sodium. In osteoporosis treatment studies alendronate 10 mg/day decreased the markers of bone formation, osteocalcin and bone specific alkaline phosphatase by approximately 50%, and total serum alkaline phosphatase by approximately 25 to 30% to reach a plateau after 6 to 12 months. In osteoporosis prevention studies alendronate 5 mg/day decreased osteocalcin and total serum alkaline phosphatase by approximately 40% and 15%, respectively. Similar reductions in the rate of bone turnover were observed in postmenopausal women during one-year studies with once weekly alendronate 70 mg for the treatment of osteoporosis and once weekly alendronate 35 mg for the prevention of osteoporosis. These data indicate that the rate of bone turnover reached a new steady- state, despite the progressive increase in the total amount of alendronate deposited within bone.

### Asfotase alfa (Strensiq) [^1176Xron]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

Drug Interference with Laboratory Tests: Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP) is used as a detection reagent in many laboratory tests and the presence of asfotase alfa in clinical laboratory samples could result in erroneous test results. Inform laboratory personnel and discuss use of an alternative testing platform for patients on treatment. (7.1)
Serum Alkaline Phosphatase: Serum ALP measurements are expected to be elevated during treatment and may be unreliable for clinical decision making. (7.1)

7.1	Drug Interference with Laboratory Tests

Laboratory Tests Utilizing Alkaline Phosphatase as a Detection Reagent

Studies have shown that there is analytical interference between asfotase alfa and laboratory tests that utilize an alkaline phosphatase (ALP)-conjugated test system, rendering erroneous test results in patients treated with STRENSIQ. ALP-conjugated test systems are utilized to measure substances such as hormones, bacterial antigens and antibodies. Therefore, it is recommended that laboratory assays which do not have ALP-conjugate technology be used when testing samples from patients who are receiving STRENSIQ.

To avoid erroneous test results for patients treated with STRENSIQ, inform laboratory personnel that the patient is being treated with STRENSIQ and discuss the use of a testing platform which does not utilize an ALP-conjugated test system.

Serum Alkaline Phosphatase

High serum ALP measurements detected through clinical laboratory testing are expected in patients receiving STRENSIQ and reflect circulating concentrations of asfotase alfa.

Do not rely on serum ALP measurements for clinical decision making in patients treated with STRENSIQ.

### Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate [^114jRUSK]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.5 Bone Loss and Mineralization Defects

Bone Mineral Density

In clinical trials in HIV-1 infected adults, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate was associated with slightly greater decreases in bone mineral density (BMD) and increases in biochemical markers of bone metabolism, suggesting increased bone turnover relative to comparators [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Serum parathyroid hormone levels and 1,25 Vitamin D levels were also higher in subjects receiving tenofovir disoproxil fumarate.

Clinical trials evaluating tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in pediatric subjects were conducted. Under normal circumstances, BMD increases rapidly in pediatric patients. In HIV-1 infected subjects 2 years to less than 18 years of age, bone effects were similar to those observed in adult subjects and suggest increased bone turnover. Total body BMD gain was less in the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate-treated HIV-1 infected pediatric subjects as compared to the control groups. Similar trends were observed in chronic HBV-infected pediatric subjects 2 years to less than 18 years of age. In all pediatric trials, normal skeletal growth (height) was not affected for the duration of the clinical trials [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

The effects of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate-associated changes in BMD and biochemical markers on long-term bone health and future fracture risk in adults and pediatric subjects 2 years and older are unknown. The long-term effect of lower spine and total body BMD on skeletal growth in pediatric patients, and in particular, the effects of long-duration exposure in younger children is unknown.

Although the effect of supplementation with calcium and vitamin D was not studied, such supplementation may be beneficial. Assessment of BMD should be considered for adult and pediatric patients who have a history of pathologic bone fracture or other risk factors for osteoporosis or bone loss. If bone abnormalities are suspected, appropriate consultation should be obtained.

Mineralization Defects

Cases of osteomalacia associated with proximal renal tubulopathy, manifested as bone pain or pain in extremities and which may contribute to fractures, have been reported in association with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate use [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Arthralgia and muscle pain or weakness have also been reported in cases of proximal renal tubulopathy. Hypophosphatemia and osteomalacia secondary to proximal renal tubulopathy should be considered in patients at risk of renal dysfunction who present with persistent or worsening bone or muscle symptoms while receiving TDF-containing products [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

### Radium ra 223 dichloride (Xofigo) [^116e9HEC]. FDA (2019). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

The active moiety of Xofigo is the alpha particle-emitting isotope radium-223 (as radium Ra 223 dichloride), which mimics calcium and forms complexes with the bone mineral hydroxyapatite at areas of increased bone turnover, such as bone metastases (see Table 2). The high linear energy transfer of alpha particles (80 keV/micrometer) leads to a high frequency of double-strand DNA breaks in adjacent cells including tumor cells, osteoblasts and osteoclasts, resulting in an anti-tumor effect on bone metastases. The alpha particle range from radium-223 dichloride is less than 100 micrometers (less than 10 cell diameters) which limits damage to the surrounding normal tissue.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Compared with placebo, there was a difference in favor of Xofigo for all five serum biomarkers for bone turnover studied in a phase 2 randomized study (bone formation markers: bone alkaline phosphatase [ALP], total ALP and procollagen I N propeptide [PINP], bone resorption markers: C-terminal crosslinking telopeptide of type I collagen [S-CTX-I] and type I collagen crosslinked C-telopeptide [ICTP]).

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

The pharmacokinetics of radium-223 dichloride in blood was linear in terms of dose proportionality and time independence in the dose range investigated (51 to 276 kBq [1.38 to 7.46 microcurie] per kg body weight).

Distribution

After intravenous injection, radium-223 is rapidly cleared from the blood and is distributed primarily into bone or is excreted into intestine. Fifteen minutes post-injection, about 20% of the injected radioactivity remained in blood. At 4 hours, about 4% of the injected radioactivity remained in blood, decreasing to less than 1% at 24 hours after the injection. At 10 minutes post-injection, radioactivity was observed in bone and in intestine. At 4 hours post-injection, the percentage of the radioactive dose present in bone and intestine was approximately 61% and 49%, respectively. No significant uptake was seen in other organs such as heart, liver, kidneys, urinary bladder, and spleen at 4 hours post-injection [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

Metabolism

Radium-223 is an isotope that decays and is not metabolized.

### Burosumab (Crysvita) [^1136cbgQ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.5 Recommended Dosage for Adult Patients with Tumor-induced Osteomalacia (18 years of age and older)

The recommended starting dosage for adults is 0.5 mg/kg body weight administered every 4 weeks, rounded to the nearest 10 mg, up to a maximum dose of 2 mg/kg not to exceed 180 mg, administered every 2 weeks.

After initiation of treatment with CRYSVITA, assess fasting serum phosphorus on a monthly basis, measured 2 weeks post-dose, for the first 3 months of treatment, and thereafter as appropriate. If serum phosphorus is within the normal range, continue with the same dose. Follow the dose adjustment schedule below to maintain serum phosphorus within the reference range.

Dose Adjustment

Reassess fasting serum phosphorus level 2 weeks after dose adjustment.

Do not adjust CRYSVITA more frequently than every 4 weeks.

Dose Increase

If serum phosphorus is below the normal range, the dose should be titrated in accordance with Table 5 up to the maximum dose of 2 mg/kg not to exceed 180 mg, administered every 2 weeks. For those individuals not reaching a serum phosphorus greater than the lower limit of the normal range, physicians may consider dividing total dose administered every 4 weeks and administering every 2 weeks.

Dose Decrease

If serum phosphorus is above the normal range, withhold the next dose and reassess the serum phosphorus level in 4 weeks. The patient must have serum phosphorus below the reference range to reinitiate CRYSVITA. Once serum phosphorus is below the reference range, treatment may be restarted at approximately half the initial starting dose, up to a maximum dose of 180 mg administered every 2 weeks for adults. After a dose decrease, reassess serum phosphorus level 2 weeks after the dose adjustment. If the level remains below the reference range after the re-initiation dose, the dose can be adjusted as outlined per Table 5.

Dose Interruption

If a patient undergoes treatment of the underlying tumor (i.e., surgical excision or radiation therapy) CRYSVITA treatment should be interrupted and serum phosphorus reassessed after treatment has been completed. CRYSVITA dose should be restarted at the patient's initiation dose if serum phosphorus remains below the lower limit of normal. Follow dose adjustment per Table 5 to maintain serum phosphorus within the reference range.

2.6 Missed Dose

If a patient misses a dose, resume CRYSVITA as soon as possible at the prescribed dose. To avoid missed doses, treatments may be administered 3 days either side of the scheduled treatment date.

WARNINGS/PRECAUTIONS

Vitamin D supplementation should be used with caution in those with hypercalcemia or conditions that may lead to hypercalcemia such as hyperparathyroidism and those who form calcium-containing kidney stones. High doses of vitamin D can lead to elevated levels of calcium that reside in the blood and soft tissues. Bone pain, high blood pressure, formation of kidney stones, renal failure, and increased risk of heart disease can occur.

Prolonged use of iron salts may produce iron storage disease.

Folic acid, especially in doses above 0.1 mg daily, may obscure pernicious anemia, in that hematologic remission may occur while neurological manifestations remain progressive.

The use of folic acid doses above 1 mg daily may precipitate or exacerbate the neurological damage of vitamin B12 deficiency.

### Calcitriol capsules 0.25 mcg (calcitriol) [^113msuLi]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

Since calcitriol is believed to be the active hormone which exerts vitamin D activity in the body, adverse effects are, in general, similar to those encountered with excessive vitamin D intake, i.e., hypercalcemia syndrome or calcium intoxication (depending on the severity and duration of hypercalcemia) (see WARNINGS). Because of the short biological half-life of calcitriol, pharmacokinetic investigations have shown normalization of elevated serum calcium within a few days of treatment withdrawal, i.e., much faster than in treatment with vitamin D3preparations.

The early and late signs and symptoms of vitamin D intoxication associated with hypercalcemia include:

Early: weakness, headache, somnolence, nausea, vomiting, dry mouth, constipation, muscle pain, bone pain, metallic taste, and anorexia, abdominal pain or stomach ache.

Late: polyuria, polydipsia, anorexia, weight loss, nocturia, conjunctivitis (calcific), pancreatitis, photophobia, rhinorrhea, pruritus, hyperthermia, decreased libido, elevated BUN, albuminuria, hypercholesterolemia, elevated SGOT (AST) and SGPT (ALT), ectopic calcification, nephrocalcinosis, hypertension, cardiac arrhythmias, dystrophy, sensory disturbances, dehydration, apathy, arrested growth, urinary tract infections, and, rarely, overt psychosis.

In clinical studies on hypoparathyroidism and pseudohypoparathyroidism, hypercalcemia was noted on at least one occasion in about 1 in 3 patients and hypercalciuria in about 1 in 7 patients. Elevated serum creatinine levels were observed in about 1 in 6 patients (approximately one half of whom had normal levels at baseline).

In concurrent hypercalcemia and hyperphosphatemia, soft-tissue calcification may occur; this can be seen radiographically (see WARNINGS).

In patients with normal renal function, chronic hypercalcemia may be associated with an increase in serum creatinine (see PRECAUTIONS: General).

Hypersensitivity reactions (pruritus, rash, urticaria, and very rarely severe erythematous skin disorders) may occur in susceptible individuals. One case of erythema multiforme and one case of allergic reaction (swelling of lips and hives all over the body) were confirmed by rechallenge.

### Pamidronate disodium [^116NnAzx]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Drug-related musculoskeletal pain and nervous system symptoms (dizziness, headache, paresthesia, increased sweating) were more common in patients with Paget's disease treated with 90 mg of pamidronate disodium than in patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy treated with the same dose.

Adverse experiences considered to be related to trial drug, which occurred in at least 5% of patients with Paget's disease treated with 90 mg of pamidronate disodium in two U.S. clinical trials, were fever, nausea, back pain, and bone pain.

At least 10% of all pamidronate disodium-treated patients with Paget's disease also experienced the following adverse experiences during clinical trials:

Cardiovascular: Hypertension

Musculoskeletal: Arthrosis, bone pain

Nervous system: Headache

Most of these adverse experiences may have been related to the underlying disease state.

Osteolytic Bone Metastases of Breast Cancer and Osteolytic Lesions of Multiple Myeloma

The most commonly reported (> 15%) adverse experiences occurred with similar frequencies in the pamidronate disodium and placebo treatment groups, and most of these adverse experiences may have been related to the underlying disease state or cancer therapy.

Of the toxicities commonly associated with chemotherapy, the frequency of vomiting, anorexia, and anemia were slightly more common in the pamidronate disodium patients whereas stomatitis and alopecia occurred at a frequency similar to that in placebo patients. In the breast cancer trials, mild elevations of serum creatinine occurred in 18.5% of pamidronate disodium patients and 12.3% of placebo patients. Mineral and electrolyte disturbances, including hypocalcemia, were reported rarely and in similar percentages of pamidronate disodium-treated patients compared with those in the placebo group. The reported frequencies of hypocalcemia, hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia, and hypomagnesemia for pamidronate disodium-treated patients were 3.3%, 10.5%, 1.7%, and 4.4%, respectively, and for placebo-treated patients were 1.2%, 12%, 1.7%, and 4.5%, respectively. In previous hypercalcemia of malignancy trials, patients treated with pamidronate disodium (60 or 90 mg over 24 hours) developed electrolyte abnormalities more frequently (see ADVERSE REACTIONS, Hypercalcemia of Malignancy).

### Burosumab (Crysvita) [^117MYp9F]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.2 Adult X-linked Hypophosphatemia

Study 4 (NCT 02526160) is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in 134 adult XLH patients. The study comprises a 24-week placebo-controlled treatment phase followed by a 24-week open-label treatment period in which all patients received CRYSVITA. CRYSVITA was administered at a dose of 1 mg/kg every 4 weeks. At study entry, the mean age of patients was 40 years (range 19 to 66 years) and 35% were male. All patients had skeletal pain associated with XLH/osteomalacia at baseline. The baseline mean (SD) serum phosphorus concentration was below the lower limit of normal at 1.98 (0.31) mg/dL. Oral phosphate and active vitamin D analogs were not allowed during the study. Out of the 134 patients enrolled in the study, one patient in the CRYSVITA group discontinued treatment during the 24-week placebo-controlled treatment period, and 7 patients discontinued CRYSVITA during the open-label treatment period.

Study 5 (NCT 02537431) is a 48-week, open-label, single-arm study in 14 adult XLH patients to assess the effects of CRYSVITA on improvement of osteomalacia as determined by histologic and histomorphometric evaluation of iliac crest bone biopsies. Patients received 1 mg/kg CRYSVITA every four weeks. At study entry, the mean age of patients was 40 years (range 25 to 52 years) and 43% were male. Oral phosphate and active vitamin D analogs were not allowed during the study.

### Abiraterone acetate (abiraterone) [^11578QKq]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.3 Hepatotoxicity

In postmarketing experience, there have been abiraterone acetate–associated severe hepatic toxicity, including fulminant hepatitis, acute liver failure and deaths [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

In the combined data of 5 randomized clinical trials, grade 3–4 ALT or AST increases (at least 5X ULN) were reported in 6% of 2230 patients who received abiraterone acetate, typically during the first 3 months after starting treatment. Patients whose baseline ALT or AST were elevated were more likely to experience liver test elevation than those beginning with normal values. Treatment discontinuation due to ALT and AST increases or abnormal hepatic function occurred in 1.1% of 2230 patients taking abiraterone acetate. In these clinical trials, no deaths clearly related to abiraterone acetate were reported due to hepatotoxicity events.

Measure serum transaminases (ALT and AST) and bilirubin levels prior to starting treatment with abiraterone acetate, every two weeks for the first three months of treatment and monthly thereafter. In patients with baseline moderate hepatic impairment receiving a reduced abiraterone acetate dose of 250 mg, measure ALT, AST, and bilirubin prior to the start of treatment, every week for the first month, every two weeks for the following two months of treatment and monthly thereafter. Promptly measure serum total bilirubin, AST, and ALT if clinical symptoms or signs suggestive of hepatotoxicity develop. Elevations of AST, ALT, or bilirubin from the patient's baseline should prompt more frequent monitoring. If at any time AST or ALT rise above five times the ULN, or the bilirubin rises above three times the ULN, interrupt abiraterone acetate treatment and closely monitor liver function.

Re-treatment with abiraterone acetate at a reduced dose level may take place only after return of liver function tests to the patient's baseline or to AST and ALT less than or equal to 2.5X ULN and total bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5X ULN [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

Permanently discontinue abiraterone acetate for patients who develop a concurrent elevation of ALT greater than 3 x ULN and total bilirubin greater than 2 x ULN in the absence of biliary obstruction or other causes responsible for the concurrent elevation [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

The safety of abiraterone acetate re-treatment of patients who develop AST or ALT greater than or equal to 20X ULN and/or bilirubin greater than or equal to 10X ULN is unknown.

### Vimseltinib (Romvimza) [^112FSBRn]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Hepatotoxicity

Cases of serious and fatal liver injury have occurred with the use of another kinase inhibitor that targets CSF1R [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)]. Serious and fatal liver injury have not been observed with ROMVIMZA.

Across clinical trials in 253 patients treated with ROMVIMZA, 2% had Grade 3 increased AST, and 1% had Grade 3 increased ALT. Dose interruptions occurred in 2% of patients and dose reductions occurred in 1% of patients due to AST/ALT increase. One patient discontinued therapy due to Grade 3 AST increased.

Avoid ROMVIMZA in patients with pre-existing increased serum transaminases; total bilirubin or direct bilirubin (> ULN); or active liver or biliary tract disease, including ALP. Monitor liver tests, including AST, ALT, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, ALP and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), prior to initiation of ROMVIMZA, twice a month for the first two months and once every 3 months for the first year of therapy and as clinically indicated thereafter. Withhold and reduce the dose, or permanently discontinue ROMVIMZA based on the severity of the hepatotoxicity [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

5.2 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity

Based on data from animal studies and its mechanism of action, ROMVIMZA can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women. In female rats administered vimseltinib, fetal structural abnormalities occurred at exposures that were at least 3 times the recommended dose based on area under the curve (AUC). Advise pregnant women on the potential risk to the fetus.

Advise females of reproductive potential and males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ROMVIMZA and for 1 month after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)].

Treatment discontinuation due to ALT and AST increases or abnormal hepatic function occurred in 1.1% of 2230 patients taking abiraterone acetate. In these clinical trials, no deaths clearly related to abiraterone acetate were reported due to hepatotoxicity events.

Measure serum transaminases (ALT and AST) and bilirubin levels prior to starting treatment with ABIRTEGA, every two weeks for the first three months of treatment and monthly thereafter. In patients with baseline moderate hepatic impairment receiving a reduced ABIRTEGA dose of 250 mg, measure ALT, AST, and bilirubin prior to the start of treatment, every week for the first month, every two weeks for the following two months of treatment and monthly thereafter. Promptly measure serum total bilirubin, AST, and ALT if clinical symptoms or signs suggestive of hepatotoxicity develop. Elevations of AST, ALT, or bilirubin from the patient's baseline should prompt more frequent monitoring. If at any time AST or ALT rise above five times the ULN, or the bilirubin rises above three times the ULN, interrupt ABIRTEGA treatment and closely monitor liver function.

### Pexidartinib hydrochloride (Turalio) [^113DestU]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Among 768 patients who received TURALIO in clinical trials, there were two irreversible cases of cholestatic liver injury. One patient with advanced cancer and ongoing liver toxicity died and one patient with a confirmed case of VBDS required a liver transplant.

In ENLIVEN, 3 of 61 (5%) patients who received TURALIO developed signs of serious liver injury, defined as ALT or AST ≥ 3 × ULN with total bilirubin ≥ 2 × ULN. In these patients, peak ALT ranged from 6 to 9 × ULN, peak total bilirubin ranged from 2.5 to 15 × ULN, and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) was ≥ 2 × ULN. ALT, AST, and total bilirubin improved to < 2 × ULN in these three patients 1 to 7 months after discontinuing TURALIO.

Avoid TURALIO in patients with pre-existing increased serum transaminases; total bilirubin or direct bilirubin (> ULN); or active liver or biliary tract disease, including increased ALP. Monitor liver tests, including AST, ALT, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, ALP, and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) prior to initiation of TURALIO, weekly for the first 8 weeks, every 2 weeks for the next month and every 3 months thereafter. Withhold and dose reduce, or permanently discontinue TURALIO based on the severity of the hepatotoxicity [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Refer patients to a hepatologist if liver tests do not return to normal. Rechallenge with a reduced dose of TURALIO may result in a recurrence of increased serum transaminases, bilirubin, ALP., or other signs of liver injury. Monitor liver tests weekly for the first month after rechallenge.

5.2 TURALIO REMS Program

TURALIO is only available through a restricted program under a REMS, because of the risk of hepatotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Notable requirements of the TURALIO REMS Program include the following:

Prescribers must be certified with the program by enrolling and completing training.
Patients must complete and sign an enrollment form for inclusion in a patient registry.
Pharmacies must be certified with the program and must only dispense to patients who are authorized to receive TURALIO.

### Denosumab (Wyost) [^114oaNKd]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

14.1 Bone Metastasis from Solid Tumors

The safety and efficacy of denosumab for the prevention of skeletal-related events in patients with bone metastases from solid tumors was demonstrated in three international, randomized (1:1), double-blind, active-controlled, noninferiority trials comparing denosumab with zoledronic acid. In all three trials, patients were randomized to receive denosumab 120 mg subcutaneously every 4 weeks or 4 mg zoledronic acid intravenously (IV) every 4 weeks (dose adjusted for reduced renal function). Patients with creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min were excluded. In each trial, the main outcome measure was demonstration of noninferiority of time to first skeletal-related event (SRE) as compared to zoledronic acid. Supportive outcome measures were superiority of time to first SRE and superiority of time to first and subsequent SRE; testing for these outcome measures occurred if the main outcome measure was statistically significant. An SRE was defined as any of the following: pathologic fracture, radiation therapy to bone, surgery to bone, or spinal cord compression.

Study 20050136 (NCT00321464) enrolled 2046 patients with advanced breast cancer and bone metastasis. Randomization was stratified by a history of prior SRE (yes or no), receipt of chemotherapy within 6 weeks prior to randomization (yes or no), prior oral bisphosphonate use (yes or no), and region (Japan or other countries). Forty percent of patients had a previous SRE, 40% received chemotherapy within 6 weeks prior to randomization, 5% received prior oral bisphosphonates, and 7% were enrolled from Japan. Median age was 57 years, 80% of patients were White, and 99% of patients were women. The median number of doses administered was 18 for denosumab and 17 for zoledronic acid.

### Valoctocogene roxaparvovec-rvox (Roctavian) [^115Be8aX]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

For one-time single-dose intravenous use only.

Treatment with ROCTAVIAN should be under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of hemophilia and/or bleeding disorders.

For Patient Selection

Perform testing for pre-existing antibodies to AAV5 using the FDA approved companion diagnostic.

DO NOT administer ROCTAVIAN to patients with a positive test for antibodies to AAV5. Information on FDA-approved tests for the detection of antibodies to AAV5 is available at: http://www.fda.gov/CompanionDiagnostics.
Perform factor VIII inhibitor titer testing [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.6)].

DO NOT administer ROCTAVIAN to a patient with a positive test for factor VIII inhibitor.
Perform liver health assessments, which include:In case of radiological liver abnormalities and/or liver function test abnormalities (ALT, AST, GGT, ALP or total bilirubin > 1.25 × ULN or INR ≥ 1.4), consider a consultation with a hepatologist to assess eligibility for ROCTAVIAN.
Liver function tests [alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), total bilirubin and international normalized ration (INR)]
Ultrasound and elastography or laboratory assessments for liver fibrosis
Assess patient's ability to receive corticosteroids and/or other immunosuppressive therapy that may be required for an extended period [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. Ensure that the risks associated with immunosuppression are acceptable for the individual patient.
DO NOT administer ROCTAVIAN to patients with active acute or uncontrolled chronic infections, known significant hepatic fibrosis (stage 3 or 4 on the Batts-Ludwig scale or equivalent) or cirrhosis, or mannitol hypersensitivity [see Contraindications (4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.8)].

### Glipizide and metformin hydrochloride [^114hqSkv]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Hypoglycemia:

Glipizide-metformin hydrochloride tablets are capable of producing hypoglycemia; therefore, proper patient selection, dosing, and instructions are important to avoid potential hypoglycemic episodes. The risk of hypoglycemia is increased when caloric intake is deficient, when strenuous exercise is not compensated by caloric supplementation, or during concomitant use with other glucose-lowering agents or ethanol. Renal insufficiency may cause elevated drug levels of both glipizide and metformin hydrochloride. Hepatic insufficiency may increase drug levels of glipizide and may also diminish gluconeogenic capacity, both of which increase the risk of hypoglycemic reactions. Elderly, debilitated, or malnourished patients and those with adrenal or pituitary insufficiency or alcohol intoxication are particularly susceptible to hypoglycemic effects. Hypoglycemia may be difficult to recognize in the elderly, and in people who are taking beta-adrenergic blocking drugs.

Renal and Hepatic Disease:

The metabolism and excretion of glipizide may be slowed in patients with impaired renal and/or hepatic function. If hypoglycemia should occur in such patients, it may be prolonged and appropriate management should be instituted.

Hemolytic Anemia:

Treatment of patients with glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency with sulfonylurea agents can lead to hemolytic anemia. Because glipizide and metformin hydrochloride tablets belong to the class of sulfonylurea agents, caution should be used in patients with G6PD deficiency and a non-sulfonylurea alternative should be considered. In postmarketing reports, hemolytic anemia has also been reported in patients who did not have known G6PD deficiency.

Vitamin B12 Levels:

In controlled clinical trials with metformin of 29 weeks duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B12, without clinical manifestations, was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B12absorption from the B12-intrinsic factor complex, is, however, very rarely associated with anemia and appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin or vitamin B12supplementation. Measurement of hematologic parameters on an annual basis is advised in patients on metformin and any apparent abnormalities should be appropriately investigated and managed (see PRECAUTIONS: Laboratory Tests).

Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B12or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B12levels. In these patients, routine serum vitamin B12measurements at two- to three-year intervals may be useful.

Macrovascular Outcomes

There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with glipizide and metformin hydrochloride or any other antidiabetic drug.

### Multiple vitamins injection (infuvite pediatric) [^112QsGJs]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.6 Potential to Develop Vitamin Deficiencies or Excesses

In patients receiving parenteral multivitamins such as with INFUVITE PEDIATRIC, blood vitamin concentrations should be periodically monitored to determine if vitamin deficiencies or excesses are developing. INFUVITE PEDIATRIC may not correct long-standing specific vitamin deficiencies. The administration of additional doses of specific vitamins may be required [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

5.7 Interference with Urine Glucose Testing

INFUVITE PEDIATRIC contains vitamin C which is also known as ascorbic acid. Ascorbic acid in the urine may cause false negative urine glucose results.

5.8 Vitamin E Overdose in Infants Receiving Additional Vitamin E

Additional vitamin E supplementations of patients receiving INFUVITE PEDIATRIC may result in elevated blood concentrations of vitamin E and potential vitamin E toxicity in infants. Avoid additional oral or parental doses of vitamin E in infants. Daily dose of INFUVITE PEDIATRIC contains adequate concentrations of vitamin E required to achieve normal blood levels of vitamin E.

5.9 Risk of Low Vitamin A Levels

Lower vitamin A concentrations may occur after administration of INFUVITE PEDIATRIC due to the adherence of Vitamin A to plastic. Monitor blood vitamin A concentrations periodically. Additional administration of therapeutic doses of vitamin A may be required, especially in low-birth weight infants.

5.10 Risk of E-Ferol Syndrome in Low-Birth Weight Infants

E-Ferol syndrome manifested by thrombocytopenia, renal dysfunction, hepatomegaly, cholestasis, ascites, hypotension and metabolic acidosis has been reported in low-birth weight infants following administration of polysorbates which are found in INFUVITE PEDIATRIC. No E-Ferol syndrome associated with INFUVITE PEDIATRIC has been reported.

Relapsed or Refractory, Systemic ALK-Positive ALCL - Study ADVL0912

The safety of XALKORI was evaluated in Study ADVL0912 [see Clinical Studies 14.2], which included 26 patients with relapsed or refractory, systemic ALCL after at least one systemic therapy. Eligible patients were 1 to ≤ 21 years of age and were required to have an absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1000/mm3(750/mm3if bone marrow was involved), platelet count ≥ 75,000/mm3(25,000/mm3if bone marrow was involved), creatinine clearance ≥ 70ml/min/1.73m2, and QTc ≤ 480 msec. The study excluded patients with ALT > 2.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN), bilirubin ≤ 1.5 times ULN, and central nervous system tumors.

Patients with ALCL received XALKORI 165 mg/m2or 280 mg/m2orally twice daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The median duration of exposure was 5.4 months (range 1.8, 82.3 months), with 46% of patients treated for at least 6 months and 35% of patients treated for at least 12 months.

Serious adverse reactions occurred in 35% of patients with ALCL treated with XALKORI. The most frequent serious adverse reactions were neutropenia (12%) and hypotension (8%).

5.6 Potential to Develop Vitamin Deficiencies or Excesses

In patients receiving parenteral multivitamins such as with INFUVITE PEDIATRIC, blood vitamin concentrations should be periodically monitored to determine if vitamin deficiencies or excesses are developing. INFUVITE PEDIATRIC may not correct long-standing specific vitamin deficiencies. The administration of additional doses of specific vitamins may be required [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

5.7 Interference with Urine Glucose Testing

INFUVITE PEDIATRIC contains vitamin C which is also known as ascorbic acid. Ascorbic acid in the urine may cause false negative urine glucose results.

5.8 Vitamin E Overdose in Infants Receiving Additional Vitamin E

Additional vitamin E supplementations of patients receiving INFUVITE PEDIATRIC may result in elevated blood concentrations of vitamin E and potential vitamin E toxicity in infants. Avoid additional oral or parental doses of vitamin E in infants. Daily dose of INFUVITE PEDIATRIC contains adequate concentrations of vitamin E required to achieve normal blood levels of vitamin E.

5.9 Risk of Low Vitamin A Levels

Lower vitamin A concentrations may occur after administration of INFUVITE PEDIATRIC due to the adherence of Vitamin A to plastic. Monitor blood vitamin A concentrations periodically. Additional administration of therapeutic doses of vitamin A may be required, especially in low-birth weight infants.

Clinical Studies

In formal clinical trials of 1509 healthy adult patients, symptoms suggestive of drug sensitivity, such as shortness of breath, chest pain, urticaria, rash and pruritus occurred in 3 patients (approximately 0.2%).

As would be expected with a drug which lowers serum estradiol levels, the most frequently reported adverse reactions were those related to hypoestrogenism.

In controlled studies comparing SYNAREL (400 µg/day) and danazol (600 or 800 mg/day), adverse reactions most frequently reported and thought to be drug-related are shown in the figure below:

In addition, less than 1% of patients experienced paresthesia, palpitations, chloasma, maculopapular rash, eye pain, asthenia, lactation, breast engorgement, and arthralgia.

Changes in Bone Density

After six months of treatment with SYNAREL, vertebral trabecular bone density and total vertebral bone mass, measured by quantitative computed tomography (QCT), decreased by an average of 8.7% and 4.3%, respectively, compared to pretreatment levels. There was partial recovery of bone density in the post-treatment period; the average trabecular bone density and total bone mass were 4.9% and 3.3% less than the pretreatment levels, respectively. Total vertebral bone mass, measured by dual photon absorptiometry (DPA), decreased by a mean of 5.9% at the end of treatment.

After six months treatment with SYNAREL, bone mass as measured by dual x-ray bone densitometry (DEXA), decreased 3.2%. Mean total vertebral mass, re-examined by DEXA six months after completion of treatment, was 1.4% below pretreatment. There was little, if any, decrease in the mineral content in compact bone of the distal radius and second metacarpal. Use of SYNAREL for longer than the recommended six months or in the presence of other known risk factors for decreased bone mineral content may cause additional bone loss.

14.2	Relapsed or Refractory, Systemic ALK-Positive Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma

The efficacy of XALKORI was evaluated in Study ADVL0912 (NCT00939770), a multicenter, single arm, open-label study in patients 1 to ≤ 21 years of age that included 26 patients with relapsed or refractory, systemic ALK-positive ALCL after at least one systemic treatment. ALK-positive status (confirmation of an ALK fusion) was determined locally by immunohistochemistry or fluorescence in situ hybridization. The study excluded patients with primary cutaneous ALCL or central nervous system involvement by lymphoma.

Patients received XALKORI 280 mg/m2(20 patients) or 165 mg/m2(6 patients) orally twice daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients were permitted to discontinue XALKORI to undergo hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).

Of the 26 patients evaluated, the median age was 11 years (range: 3 to 20); 69% were male, 54% were White, 19% Black, 8% Asian. Patient enrollment by age category was 4 patients from 3 to < 6 years, 11 patients from 6 to < 12 years, 7 patients from 12 to < 18 years, and 4 patients from 18 to ≤ 21 years.

All patients had received multi-agent systemic therapy, 2 (8%) had received a prior HSCT and 4 (15%) had received at least 3 prior therapies.

Efficacy was based on objective response rate and duration of response, as assessed by an independent review committee (Table 19). The median time to first response was 3.9 weeks (range: 3.5 to 9.1 weeks).

### Benign familial hyperphosphatasemia… [^116VC1qq]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Elevated alkaline phosphatase activity in serum suggests bone or liver disease or a neoplasm but can also indicate pregnancy or another benign condition. A family with benign hyperphosphatasemia was studied to elucidate the genetics and enzyme defect. Serum total alkaline phosphatase activity was greater than the population mean in all six family members, and more than 7 SDs above the mean in two of four offspring. Monoclonal antibodies to three alkaline phosphatase isoenzymes, intestinal, placental, and tissue nonspecific, demonstrated markedly increased intestinal alkaline phosphatase levels in all family members and significantly elevated liver/bone/ kidney activity in the two offspring. Guanidine hydrochloride denaturation of the liver/bone/kidney component showed high alkaline phosphatase activity from liver in both siblings and from bone in one.

The mode of inheritance in this family is obscure, but a complex regulation of the products of two different alkaline phosphatase genes seems likely. Steps toward diagnosis are suggested. Early recognition of this benign biochemical abnormality should help to avoid unnecessary diagnostic tests. Siraganian PA, Mulvihill JJ, Mulivor RA, Miller RW. Benign Familial Hyperphosphatasemia.
