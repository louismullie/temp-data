## Question

Is migraine with aura contraindicated in hot

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether migraine with aura is contraindicated in hot environments or with heat exposure. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "contraindicated" means in this context and whether that term applies to environmental exposures. Then, I should verify what the provided documents say about heat or hot environments and migraine with aura. Next, I will check for any indirect or related safety considerations that could be conflated with heat. After that, I should review authoritative guidelines and labels for any explicit cautions. Finally, I will synthesize a clear, grounded conclusion and practical advice, making sure I'm not overextending any inferences from the data provided.

> Let me first confirm the terminology so I don't misstate the issue. "Contraindicated" is a medical term used for therapies, procedures, or substances that should not be used in a given condition due to harm risk; it is not typically used for environmental exposures like heat, so I need to be careful not to overextend the term here. Hold on, I should verify whether any guideline or label in the provided set uses "contraindicated" in relation to heat and migraine with aura; I don't see such usage in the cited materials, which instead reserve "contraindicated" for drugs or devices in specific patient populations, such as combined hormonal contraception in women with migraine with aura due to stroke risk, not for environmental heat exposure [^115hteJP] [^116bt8Vg] [^111nhED7] [^115RPFSp].

> Next, I should review what the provided sources actually say about heat and migraine. Wait, let me verify the trigger data. One large survey identified heat as a patient-reported trigger in about 30% of migraine patients, but it did not isolate migraine with aura from migraine without aura, so I cannot conclude that heat is uniquely contraindicated for aura specifically based on that dataset. I should also note that the experimental hypoxia study deliberately controlled out temperature and other external factors to isolate hypoxia as a trigger, which means it cannot be used to infer that heat is a validated trigger in migraine with aura. So, the best I can say from the provided sources is that heat is a commonly reported trigger across migraine populations, not a formal contraindication and not specifically studied for aura-only cohorts in these materials [^115dwJJv] [^1155Et22].

> I will now examine whether any guideline or label in the set explicitly warns against heat exposure in migraine with aura. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should double-check the VA/DoD guidelines, AAN/AHS guidance, and FDA labels for acute treatments. I find no statements that heat or hot environments are contraindicated for people with migraine with aura in these sources. Instead, the documents focus on medication contraindications, diagnostic criteria, and vascular risk management, not environmental temperature advisories. This absence strongly suggests that, within the scope of the provided references, there is no formal contraindication regarding heat exposure for migraine with aura [^notfound].

> But wait, what if the confusion stems from related safety issues that get conflated with heat? I need to check for indirect links. The well-established contraindication is combined hormonal contraception in women with migraine with aura due to increased ischemic stroke risk; that is a medication contraindication, not an environmental one. Separately, migraine with aura is associated with modestly increased cardiovascular risk, and guidelines recommend optimizing vascular risk factors, again unrelated to ambient temperature. I should confirm that none of these translate into a heat-specific prohibition; they do not. So, while vascular risk is real and should be managed, it does not create a heat-exposure contraindication in these materials [^115hteJP] [^113r2HbD] [^114p6PXh] [^111XVoqo].

> Let me consider practical clinical implications without overstating the evidence. Since heat is a commonly reported trigger, individualized trigger identification and mitigation are reasonable, but that is not the same as declaring heat "contraindicated". I should confirm that standard migraine care emphasizes trigger management and acute treatment strategies; yes, guidelines and reviews support patient education on triggers and appropriate acute therapy, and they do not advise avoiding heat categorically for those with aura. Therefore, a balanced approach is to counsel patients to track whether heat reliably precipitates attacks and to use pre-emptive strategies (hydration, cooling, timing of acute therapy) rather than imposing a blanket restriction on heat exposure [^11246K1g] [^111GVeU7] [^115dwJJv].

> Synthesis and conclusion: I should double-check that I'm aligning with the evidence boundaries. Based on the provided sources, there is no formal contraindication stating that migraine with aura prohibits exposure to hot environments or heat. Heat appears as a patient-reported trigger in a subset of migraine patients, but the materials do not establish a unique prohibition for aura phenotypes or a guideline-backed restriction on heat exposure. Therefore, the accurate answer is that migraine with aura is not contraindicated in hot environments according to the provided references; instead, patients should be counseled to identify personal triggers and manage vascular risk factors where applicable, with individualized plans for heat exposure if it consistently precipitates attacks [^115dwJJv] [^113r2HbD] [^114p6PXh].

---

There is **no absolute contraindication** to heat exposure for patients with migraine with aura. Heat is a recognized trigger for some patients [^115dwJJv], but it is not universally contraindicated. Patients should be counseled to **identify and avoid personal triggers**, including heat, and to manage heat exposure with hydration, cooling, and prompt treatment of aura or headache. If heat consistently triggers attacks, consider preventive strategies or alternative therapies [^11246K1g] [^114yWAAt]. There is no evidence that heat increases stroke risk in migraine with aura beyond the baseline vascular risk, which should be managed proactively [^113r2HbD].

---

## Pathophysiological relationship between heat and migraine with aura

Heat exposure can precipitate migraine attacks, including those with aura, through several mechanisms:

- **Vasodilation**: Heat-induced vasodilation may exacerbate headache pain in migraine patients.

- **Dehydration**: Heat exposure can cause dehydration, a known migraine trigger.

- **Neurological effects**: Heat may influence cortical spreading depression (CSD), the underlying mechanism of aura, although direct evidence is limited.

---

## Clinical evidence on heat exposure and migraine with aura

There is **no absolute contraindication** to heat exposure for patients with migraine with aura. Heat is a recognized trigger for some patients, but it is not universally contraindicated. Patients should be counseled to identify and avoid personal triggers, including heat, and to manage heat exposure with hydration, cooling, and prompt treatment of aura or headache. If heat consistently triggers attacks, consider preventive strategies or alternative therapies. There is no evidence that heat increases stroke risk in migraine with aura beyond the baseline vascular risk, which should be managed proactively [^113r2HbD] [^114p6PXh].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines do not list heat exposure as a **contraindication** for patients with migraine with aura. Instead, they emphasize:

- **Trigger identification**: Patients should identify and avoid personal triggers, including heat, if it consistently precipitates attacks.

- **Preventive strategies**: Preventive medications and lifestyle modifications are recommended for patients with frequent or severe attacks [^11246K1g].

- **Acute treatment**: Acute treatments, including triptans and CGRP receptor antagonists, are recommended for acute attacks, with consideration of aura-specific timing and safety [^116UKkoU] [^114MAxhC].

---

## Potential risks and complications

While heat exposure is not absolutely contraindicated, it may pose certain risks for patients with migraine with aura:

- **Increased frequency and severity**: Heat exposure may increase the frequency and severity of migraine attacks, including aura symptoms.

- **Stroke risk**: Migraine with aura is associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke, particularly in women [^114p6PXh]. However, there is no direct evidence that heat exposure independently increases stroke risk in these patients [^notfound].

- **Dehydration and electrolyte imbalance**: Heat exposure can lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances, which may exacerbate migraine symptoms.

---

## Clinical management and precautions

Patients with migraine with aura who are exposed to heat should take the following precautions:

- **Hydration**: Maintain adequate hydration before, during, and after heat exposure.

- **Cooling measures**: Use cooling strategies such as fans, air conditioning, or cold packs.

- **Avoidance**: Avoid prolonged exposure to extreme heat or direct sunlight.

- **Prompt treatment**: Treat aura and headache symptoms promptly with appropriate medications.

- **Preventive strategies**: Consider preventive medications or lifestyle modifications if heat consistently triggers attacks [^11246K1g] [^115dwJJv].

---

## Alternative therapies and preventive measures

Several **alternative therapies and preventive measures** may help manage heat-triggered migraine with aura:

- **Preventive medications**: Beta-blockers, antiepileptics (e.g. topiramate, lamotrigine), and CGRP monoclonal antibodies may reduce attack frequency and severity [^11246K1g] [^114yWAAt] [^1176Prwa].

- **Lifestyle modifications**: Regular sleep, stress management, and dietary adjustments may reduce migraine frequency.

- **Non-pharmacological interventions**: Acupuncture, biofeedback, and cognitive-behavioral therapy may be beneficial for some patients [^11246K1g] [^112qPLJY].

---

## Conclusion and clinical recommendations

Heat exposure is **not absolutely contraindicated** for patients with migraine with aura. It may trigger attacks in some individuals, but with appropriate precautions and management, patients can safely tolerate heat exposure. Clinicians should:

- **Counsel patients**: Educate patients on identifying and avoiding personal triggers, including heat if applicable.

- **Develop individualized plans**: Tailor preventive and acute treatment strategies to patient-specific triggers and risk factors.

- **Monitor vascular risk**: Address cardiovascular risk factors, as patients with migraine with aura have an increased risk of ischemic stroke [^113r2HbD] [^114p6PXh].

In summary, heat exposure is not absolutely contraindicated for patients with migraine with aura. Individualized counseling, preventive strategies, and prompt acute treatment are essential for managing heat-triggered attacks.

Methods

Criteria for considering studies in this review

Types of studies

Randomised controlled trials were included in this study without language or publication status restrictions. Any study with a sample size of fewer than 10 participants can be included in this systematic review, but will be excluded from relevant meta-analyses due to concerns of potentially high risk of publication bias and an inflated magnitude of OR. In the study selection phase, we found no studies with fewer than 10 participants.

Types of participants

This study included female participants who were diagnosed with MM, either PMM or MRM, regardless of their age, race, sex or marital status. Only studies with explicit diagnosis of MM were included in this trial. However, studies on general migraine without aura that did not take measures to isolate MM from the population or even mentioned menstrual migraine in their study protocol and final report were excluded. Those with overt acupuncture contraindications (bleeding disorders and anticoagulation) were excluded.

Types of interventions

Experimental interventions

The experimental arm was explicitly claimed as a modality of acupuncture or its related acupoint stimulation such as needle, heat, electricity, physical pressure, laser and so on. The combinational use of acupuncture to medications was considered in this review. Studies that compared the efficacy of different forms of acupuncture were excluded.

Control interventions

The following control groups were considered: (1) acupuncture versus sham devices; (2) acupuncture versus routine care; (3) acupuncture versus medications; and (4) acupuncture in addition to active treatment (medications conventionally used for immediate pain relief) versus active treatment alone.

Types of outcome measures

Primary outcome

The primary outcome was the number of migraine attacks per month at completion of acupuncture treatment.

Secondary outcomes

Secondary outcomes included (1) days with migraine per month; (2) mean headache intensity measured by the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS); (3) amount of headache medication use; (4) number of migraine attacks per month at the last post-treatment visit (3–6 months); and (5) adverse events (AEs).

Introduction

Specific problems occur in clinical treatment trials for migraine with aura that differ from those encountered in treatment trials for migraine without aura.

Discussion

Based on our experience with four such trials, we point to a number of possible solutions and outline areas for future inquiry. We make recommendations about subject selection; the choice, definition and assessment of outcome measures; optimal treatments in relation to aura and headache; and we provide samples of study report forms used to record occurrence of aura and headache in this population.

### May lamotrigine be an alternative to topiramate in the prevention of migraine with aura? Results of a retrospective study [^114yWAAt]. BMJ Neurology Open (2020). High credibility.

Conclusion

Lamotrigine is equally effective as topiramate for the preventive treatment of migraine with aura and exhibits a better tolerability profile. Lamotrigine should be considered in clinical practice especially for patients reporting prolonged aura and who do not respond, have contraindications or discontinue topiramate treatment due to side effects.

### Migraine and aura triggered by normobaric hypoxia [^1155Et22]. Cephalalgia (2020). Medium credibility.

Strengths and limitations

In this study, we employed normobaric hypoxia as a trigger for headaches and migraines in a large population of 30 otherwise healthy patients with and without migraine. The results demonstrate that genuine migraine attacks can be elicited under hypoxia without chemical stimuli. However, an interaction of oxidative agents with molecular or cellular mechanisms not inherent to authentic migraines cannot be completely excluded. As there are virtually no strict contraindications against exposure to normobaric hypoxia, it can be applied even to those excluded from receiving common triggering substances. The reported visual aura symptoms were in no way different to the aura symptoms usually experienced by the migraineurs with aura and not accompanied by any other neurological symptoms. Therefore, we conclude that these symptoms signal proper aura events and not ischemic vascular events during the long normobaric hypoxia, even in the two subjects who never experienced aura before. Our procedures and experimental conditions were highly standardized to rule out external influences such as temperature, sunlight, exertion and dehydration. By utilizing an NHC, we also prevented disruptive factors that might occur when applying hypoxia through a breathing mask (odours, pericranial pressure, atmospheric pressure differences, breathing resistance). As was pointed out in a previous review of experimental migraine models, experimentally induced migraines cannot fulfill the complete ICHD-III criteria. In this study we tried to approximate the experimentally induced migraines to authentic migraines by patient self-evaluation. A potential drawback in the design of our study is the lack of a control group or sham exposition. However, after conducting hypoxic research for almost 2 decades and thorough sicentific consideration, we refrained from utilizing a sham approach. Most volunteers subjected to an FiO 2 of 12.6% almost immediately perceive the lack of oxygen due to shortness of breath followed by an increased respiratory drive, rendering an accurate blinding unlikely. As this study is based on an earlier experiment published by our group to evaluate migraine-like headache in healthy non-migraineurs under hypoxia, we abstained from including another group of healthy volunteers.

### Hypothermia during migraine attacks [^114Pzq3J]. Cephalalgia (2010). Low credibility.

Episodic spontaneous hypothermia is an infrequent disorder. Here, the case of a patient with migraine who experienced hypothermia during her migraine attacks is presented. The authors propose that larger clinical series should be studied to evaluate the occurrence of hypothermia in migraine, as well as the possible influence of some preventive regimens in this setting.

### May lamotrigine be an alternative to topiramate in the prevention of migraine with aura? Results of a retrospective study [^115KEAyf]. BMJ Neurology Open (2020). High credibility.

Background

Evidence suggests that lamotrigine could be effective in reducing aura frequency and duration. However, studies comparing lamotrigine to other, first-line prophylactic agents solely involving patients suffering from migraine with aura are still lacking. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of lamotrigine and topiramate for the preventive treatment of migraine with aura.

Methods

Fifty-three patients suffering from migraine with aura treated with lamotrigine or topiramate for at least 6 months were included. Pre- and post-treatment clinical data regarding monthly aura frequency and duration, monthly migraine frequency, days of headache and rescue medication used per month were collected.

Results

Responder rates were similar between the two treatment groups at 6-month follow-up. Interestingly, responder rates for aura frequency and duration were higher in the lamotrigine group compared with the topiramate group (88% vs 79% and 73% vs 54%). Moreover, 50% of the lamotrigine-treated patients reported a complete disappearance of migraine aura compared with 37% of topiramate-treated patients. Side effects were more frequent in topiramate group compared with lamotrigine group (p = 0.004).

Conclusions

Lamotrigine should be considered in clinical practice for the preventive treatment of migraine with aura especially for patients reporting prolonged aura and who do not respond, have contraindications or discontinue topiramate treatment due to side effects.

1. Clinical trials for the acute treatment of migraine attacks

1.1. Subject selection

1.1.1. Migraine definition

Recommendation:

Eligible subjects should fulfil the diagnostic criteria for migraine according to the most current version of the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD) of the IHS.

Comments:

Clinical trials of acute treatments for migraine can include subjects who have migraine without aura, migraine with aura, and both migraine types, but the ICHD diagnostic criteria should be fulfilled to avoid population heterogeneity. In trials focusing on the acute treatment of migraine with aura, subjects with both migraine types can be included, as aura symptoms are recognizable, the attack types are distinguishable, and most people who have migraine with aura also have attacks of migraine without aura. (Refer to Section 2.1 for more information about migraine with aura.) In trials enrolling participants with a history of both types of attacks, the type of the treated attack should be classified according to ICHD criteria based on the clinical features captured in a diary. Note that this requirement may be impractical when subjects are instructed to treat early, because early treatment of migraine can modify the clinical features of an attack and thereby prevent analysis by type (refer to Section 2.2 for more information about early intervention trials). In some instances, after efficacy and safety have been demonstrated in subjects with confirmed diagnoses of migraine without aura and migraine with aura, trials targeting subjects with probable migraine – migraine-like attacks missing one of the features required to fulfil all criteria for a type or subtype of migraine – may be appropriate.

### May lamotrigine be an alternative to topiramate in the prevention of migraine with aura? Results of a retrospective study [^1174fg6g]. BMJ Neurology Open (2020). High credibility.

Contrary to topiramate, the role of lamotrigine in the prevention of migraine is more controversial.

The North American guidelines for the preventive treatment of episodic migraine included lamotrigine among medications established to be ineffective. This low level of grading is essentially based on the results of two prospective, randomized, controlled trials, involving migraineurs both with and without aura. Both studies failed to demonstrate the efficacy of lamotrigine in migraine prophylaxis compare to placebo and topiramate respectively. However, posthoc analysis from the abovementioned studies, exploring the role of lamotrigine in reducing migraine aura frequency, was not conducted due to the small number of patients suffering from migraine with auraincluded. Lamotrigine is an antiepileptic drug that exerts its function by blocking voltage-sensitive sodium channels, indirectly leading to the inhibition of neuronal release of glutamate, a neurotransmitter involved in the development and propagation of CSD. Evidence suggests that chronic intraperitoneal administration of lamotrigine determine a strong suppression of CSD propagation in rats compared with placebo and valproate. More than a decade ago, several pilot, open label studies exploring the role of lamotrigine in the prophylaxis of migraine aura were conducted and pointed to a great efficacy of the drug in reducing both frequency and duration of aura episodes. Based on these findings, a prospective open study including 59 patients suffering from migraine with aura treated with lamotrigine showed a sustained reduction of aura frequency and duration. Additionally, more than three quarters of the aura responder patients also reported a significance reduction of migraine attacks frequency during the treatment period, suggesting a potential efficacy of lamotrigine for the prophylaxis of migraine headache as well. Based on these results, lamotrigine is largely used in clinical practice for the preventive treatment of migraine with aura especially in patients for whom other preventive treatments are ineffective or contraindicated, although clear evidence supporting the non-inferiority of lamotrigine compared with other approved migraine prophylactic agents is still lacking.

### May lamotrigine be an alternative to topiramate in the prevention of migraine with aura? Results of a retrospective study [^115UEEN9]. BMJ Neurology Open (2020). High credibility.

Material and methods

We reviewed the clinical records of 1152 patients referred to our Headache Clinic from January 2014 to February 2019. Inclusion criteria for the enrolment were: a diagnosis of migraine with aura or aura without migraine according to the last Headache International Society diagnostic criteria; aged ≥ 18 years; migraine onset before the 50 years of age; presence of migraine attacks for at least 1 year prior to entering the study; at least two attacks of migraine with aura or aura without migraine per month in the previous 3 months. Exclusion criteria were: any other non-migraine headache; chronic headache defined as more than 15 headache days per month; coexistence of medication overuse headache; any other severe co-morbid medical condition (e.g. cardiac, hepatic, renal and psychiatric disease); other preventive migraine treatments in the last 3 months prior to entering the study; previous failure of more than two prophylactic agents. Patients allocation to topiramate or lamotrigine treatment was based on neurologist's clinical judgement, taking into account patient clinical scenario, possible contraindications to the drugs, previous ineffective preventive treatments as well as patient preferences.

### Clinical practice guideline: Ménière's disease [^114rkCgR]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2020). High credibility.

International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD) migraine with aura — diagnosis requires at least 2 attacks fulfilling B and C; one or more fully reversible aura symptoms (visual, sensory, speech and/or language, motor, brainstem, or retinal); and at least 3 of 6 characteristics: at least 1 aura symptom spreads gradually over ≥ 5 minutes, two or more aura symptoms in succession, each individual aura symptom lasts 5–60 minutes, at least 1 aura symptom is unilateral, at least 1 aura symptom is positive, and the aura is accompanied, or followed within 60 minutes, by headache; not better accounted for by another ICHD-3 diagnosis. Notes add that when 3 symptoms occur during an aura the acceptable maximal duration is 3 × 60 minutes and motor symptoms may last up to 72 hours.

### May lamotrigine be an alternative to topiramate in the prevention of migraine with aura? Results of a retrospective study [^115kj7vE]. BMJ Neurology Open (2020). High credibility.

Finally, according to the North American Antiepileptic Drug pregnancy registry, topiramate showed a dose independent threefold higher risk of congenital malformations and child developmental retardation in women exposed to the drug, especially in the first trimester of pregnancy. On the other hand, teratogenic activity of lamotrigine is dose-dependent and exerted at higher dosage than that used for migraine prophylaxis. Based on our findings, lamotrigine should be considered in clinical practice for patients having migraine with aura reporting unresponsiveness to topiramate treatment or who discontinue the drug due to side effects. Moreover, lamotrigine could be safely offered to patients who have contraindications to topiramate, especially migraine with aura women planning to have pregnancy.

Regarding the effects on aura frequency and duration, our results showed a trend towards a better efficacy of lamotrigine compared with topiramate. Responder rates for monthly aura frequency were similar between the two treatment groups. However, approximately half of the lamotrigine-treated patients reported a complete disappearance of aura at 6-month follow-up. Additionally, lamotrigine determined a reduction of aura duration per episode of approximately 15 min. In line with previous findings, lamotrigine should then be considered in clinical practice for the treatment of prolonged or disturbing migraine with aura. We are aware of several limitations of this study. A possible bias in patients' selection, the small number of patients recruited, the absence of a placebo controlled group and the retrospective nature of our study may have indicated a higher efficacy of both drugs than observed in other studies. Although results similar to ours for lamotrigine have been previously reported by Pascual et al with a retrospective, non-placebo-controlledì analysis, we think that the main result of our study was not the demonstration of the effectiveness of any specific drug, rather the evidence of a similar effectiveness of lamotrigine compared with topiramate. This could open new therapeutic possibilities, especially in patients for whom topiramate is contraindicated or who are intolerant to this drug. We hope that our observation may stimulate further prospective, double-blind, randomized, controlled trials to prove the role of lamotrigine in the prophylaxis of migraine with aura.

### Migraine headache prophylaxis [^11246K1g]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Migraine headaches are a debilitating condition that affects approximately 1% of the US population. Goals of migraine prophylaxis include reduction in headache severity and frequency, improved response to acute treatment, fewer days with disability, improvement in quality of life, and empowerment of patients with a sense of control over the condition. Indications for consideration of preventive therapy include frequent headaches, failure of or contraindication to acute treatments, overuse of acute treatments, and patient preference. First-line medications include propranolol, metoprolol, topiramate, divalproex, valproate, and calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor antagonists. However, use of calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor antagonists is limited by cost and insurance coverage. Amitriptyline and venlafaxine are considered second-line medications due to a greater number of adverse events and less supporting evidence, respectively. OnabotulinumtoxinA (Botox) injection is approved for chronic migraine prophylaxis. It is as effective as other medications, is well tolerated, and has lower discontinuation rates than other drugs. Common migraine triggers include alcohol, anxiety, dehydration, excessive caffeine, eye strain, hunger, sleep deprivation, and stress. Physicians should recommend identification and management of migraine triggers. Cognitive behavior therapy, acupuncture, neural stimulators, and exercise are supported by varying levels of evidence and can be used individually or in combination with pharmacotherapy. Alternative agents, including feverfew, magnesium, and melatonin, have shown effectiveness and are generally well tolerated.

2. Special issues

2.1. Migraine with aura

Many people who have migraine without aura also have attacks of migraine with aura. Both attack types have, in most cases, similar headache features and associated symptoms, and they may share the same basic pain mechanisms. So far, no treatment has been shown to be effective when administered in the aura phase, either for reducing the duration of the aura or preventing the subsequent headache; in separate assessments of acute treatment given during the aura phase, sumatriptan 6 mg SC and eletriptan 40 mg oral tablets had no effect on the aura or the headache.

The main challenge in clinical trials focused on subjects who have migraine with aura is diagnostic accuracy. The current ICHD classification recognizes the main type, migraine with typical aura (group 1.2.1), as well as variants for typical aura followed by migraine headache, typical aura followed by non-migraine headache, and aura not followed by headache. Since most acute treatment trials are carried out in mixed populations – subjects who have migraine with aura, subjects who have migraine without aura, and subjects who have attacks of both migraine types – investigators cannot determine whether both types of attacks occurring in the same subject have similar or different responses to treatment unless each attack is separately classified as migraine with aura or migraine without aura. Therefore, a detailed recording of each aura symptom and the total duration of the aura is mandatory, and these should be based on uniform requirements. To improve accuracy and ensure that response to migraine-associated aura is being evaluated, diagnostic and treatment diaries capable of recording specific aura symptoms and duration of aura should be used. With these specialized instruments, an observation of blurred vision or visual snow, which might be mistaken for aura with a standard diary, would not be enough to classify an attack as migraine with aura. Note that in trials designed to assess treatment of the aura phase, detailed instruction about the proper use of diaries is mandatory.

Analysis of evidence — The original search identified 179 articles, and a supplemental search (2007–2009) yielded 105 additional articles; of the total 284 articles, 29 were classified as Class I or Class II. Included studies randomized adult patients with migraine to an agent or a comparator (including placebo) and utilized masked outcome assessment, and at least 2 panelists independently reviewed and rated each study according to the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) therapeutic classification of evidence scheme; studies with completion rates below 80% were downgraded. Studies were excluded if they assessed acute migraine treatment, migraine aura treatment/prevention, or nonpharmacologic treatments.

### Guidelines of the international headache society for controlled trials of acute treatment of migraine attacks in adults: fourth edition [^116AKjca]. Cephalalgia (2019). Medium credibility.

1.2.9. Timing of administration

Recommendations:

1.2.9.1. The timing of acute treatment should be defined in the trial protocol.

1.2.9.2. Usually, participants are instructed to treat when migraine headache pain is of at least moderate intensity, but alternatives include treating as soon as possible after headache onset, treating when pain intensity is mild, and treating when pain intensity is severe.

1.2.9.3. The timing of acute treatment must be consistent with the objectives of the trial.

1.2.9.4. Subjects should record the time and pain intensity at the time of treatment in the trial diary.

Comments:

The head pain of migraine frequently begins with mild intensity, progressively increases with variable speed to a peak, and is followed by resolution; headache pain can also fluctuate spontaneously during a migraine attack. These characteristics can pose challenges regarding the timing of treatment (e.g. early or when the attack is fully developed) and the evaluation of trial results. For example, healthcare providers typically recommend treating early in the course of a migraine attack, while pain intensity is mild, because it can enhance efficacy. At the beginning of an attack, however, migraine without aura can be difficult to distinguish from non-migraine headaches. Thus, subjects in migraine clinical trials who are instructed to treat as soon as possible (i.e. at the first sign of migraine) may mistakenly treat other headache types. The potential for confusion is mitigated when attacks are allowed to fully develop. Having subjects wait until pain intensity is moderate or severe before treating increases the specificity of migraine diagnoses. Yet because this strategy conflicts with common clinical advice about early treatment, it is essential that participants in clinical trials receive clear instruction about when to use acute treatment. In later stages of development, depending on the specific objectives of the program, trials evaluating early intervention and treatment when headache pain intensity is severe (e.g. for early morning migraine) are encouraged when investigating the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of new treatments.

### Levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol (levora) [^116bt8Vg]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

9. Headache

LEVORA 0.15/30–28 is contraindicated in females who have headaches with focal neurological symptoms or have migraine headaches with aura, and in women over age 35 years who have migraine headaches with or without aura (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).

If a woman using LEVORA 0.15/30–28 develops new headaches that are recurrent, persistent, or severe, evaluate the cause and discontinue LEVORA 0.15/30–28 if indicated. Consider discontinuation of LEVORA 0.15/30–28 if there is an increased frequency or severity of migraines during COC use (which may be prodromal of a cerebrovascular event).

Neurology (2019). High credibility.

Triptans during aura and specialist referral in pediatric migraine explains that clinicians should counsel adolescent patients with migraine with aura that taking their triptan during a typical aura is safe, but that the triptan may be more effective if taken at the onset of head pain (Level B), consistent with evidence in adults that it is safe to take triptans during the aura although they may be more effective if taken at the onset of pain. The page also states that according to the FDA, triptans are contraindicated in those with a history of hemiplegic aura or migraine with brainstem aura, and clinicians may consider referral of children and adolescents who do not respond to other treatments to a headache specialist to find effective treatment (Level C).

### Migraine [^111GVeU7]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2022). High credibility.

Migraine is a common, chronic, disorder that is typically characterized by recurrent disabling attacks of headache and accompanying symptoms, including aura. The aetiology is multifactorial with rare monogenic variants. Depression, epilepsy, stroke and myocardial infarction are comorbid diseases. Spreading depolarization probably causes aura and possibly also triggers trigeminal sensory activation, the underlying mechanism for the headache. Despite earlier beliefs, vasodilation is only a secondary phenomenon and vasoconstriction is not essential for antimigraine efficacy. Management includes analgesics or NSAIDs for mild attacks, and, for moderate or severe attacks, triptans or 5HT 1B/1D receptor agonists. Because of cardiovascular safety concerns, unreliable efficacy and tolerability issues, use of ergots to abort attacks has nearly vanished in most countries. CGRP receptor antagonists (gepants) and lasmiditan, a selective 5HT1 F receptor agonist, have emerged as effective acute treatments. Intramuscular onabotulinumtoxinA may be helpful in chronic migraine (migraine on ≥ 15 days per month) and monoclonal antibodies targeting CGRP or its receptor, as well as two gepants, have proven effective and well tolerated for the preventive treatment of migraine. Several neuromodulation modalities have been approved for acute and/or preventive migraine treatment. The emergence of new treatment targets and therapies illustrates the bright future for migraine management.

### Transient ischaemic attacks: mimics and chameleons [^114vHAtq]. Practical Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Migraine aura

Up to about 20% of patients with suspected TIA have migraine aura; this is the most common mimic in our experience (figure 1). The diagnostic challenge arises particularly when the aura occurs with minimal or no headache. This phenomenon, described by Miller Fisher as 'late-life migraine accompaniment', is now usually referred to as acephalgic migraine. A migraine aura reflects cortical spreading depression, so classically has a spreading onset corresponding to adjacent cortical regions over minutes, usually resolving within 30 min and only rarely lasting over an hour. Visual disturbances, sometimes with scintillating scotomata, geometric (especially zigzag) patterns or other positive symptoms with varied descriptions ('like looking through a heat haze'; 'like looking through raindrops moving down a window'; 'like looking through a kaleidoscope', etc), are the most common. It may help to ask the patient to draw their visual aura (figure 2). Auras can include sensory, motor or speech disturbances. In migraine, different modalities may be involved (eg, visual and somatosensory) but they often occur sequentially, with one resolving as the other begins, rather than all simultaneously as in TIAs. Although auras are typically experienced just before or simultaneously with headache, headache onset can occasionally be delayed for more than an hour after the end of the aura.

Figure 2
Drawing of a visual migraine aura by a patient showing a characteristic zigzag pattern.

Headache may also occur at TIA or stroke onset, especially in young women with a prior history of migraine, where it is probably triggered by the stroke (ie, a 'symptomatic' rather than "primary" migraine). Thus the presence of typical migrainous aura or headache does not exclude TIA (or stroke). The concept of migrainous infarction is controversial and the safest initial policy is to assume that migraine does not cause cerebrovascular events, and to investigate all patients for alternative causes.

### Guidelines of the international headache society for controlled trials of acute treatment of migraine attacks in adults: fourth edition [^1165RaQb]. Cephalalgia (2019). Medium credibility.

1.1.4. Frequency of attacks

Recommendations:

1.1.4.1. Attacks of migraine should occur two to eight times per month.

1.1.4.2. The frequency of other headaches (including non-target) must be no greater than 1 day per month.

1.1.4.3. There should be at least 48 hours of freedom from headache between attacks of migraine under study.

1.1.4.4. Subjects should experience fewer than 15 headache days per month.

Comments:

A minimum of two attacks per month is recommended. The maximum frequency of eight attacks per month reduces the probability that those with incipient medication overuse, medication-overuse headache, or chronic migraine will be included in the trial. Allowing 48 hours of freedom from headache between migraine attacks permits clear identification of individual attacks and distinction from relapse, and it avoids the use of multiple treatments for a single prolonged attack. The evaluation of three to five consecutive attacks provides information on consistency of response and may attenuate the placebo effect on the first attack (refer to Section 1.2.12 for more information about consistency of response).

1.1.5. Duration of migraine

Recommendation:

Migraine should be present for at least 1 year prior to inclusion in a clinical trial.

Comments:

Because there are no objective signs or biomarkers for the diagnosis of migraine, and the 1-year requirement increases the specificity of the diagnostic criteria, a minimum course of 1 year is advised to exclude people with headache types that may mimic migraine. The history may be based on subject recall or physician evaluation of medical records. At least five prior attacks of migraine without aura or two prior attacks of migraine with aura are required for diagnoses using ICHD criteria.

1.1.6. Age at onset

Recommendation:

The age at onset of migraine should be less than 50 years.

Comments:

Few adults will be excluded by this criterion, as migraine beginning after the age of 50 years is rare, and the prevalence of secondary headaches or organic diseases mimicking migraine increases after age 50. The inclusion of subjects with onset of migraine after 50 years of age can be considered in phase IV trials, as long as the migraine diagnosis is well established by ICHD criteria, and secondary headaches have been ruled out.

### The triggers or precipitants of the acute migraine attack [^115dwJJv]. Cephalalgia (2007). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to evaluate and define the triggers of the acute migraine attack. Patients rated triggers on a 0–3 scale for the average headache. Demographics, prodrome, aura, headache characteristics, postdrome, medication responsiveness, acute and chronic disability, sleep characteristics and social and personal characteristics were also recorded. One thousand two hundred and seven International Classification of Headache Disorders-2 (1.1–1.2, and 1.5.1) patients were evaluated, of whom 75.9% reported triggers (40.4% infrequently, 26.7% frequently and 8.8% very frequently). The trigger frequencies were stress (79.7%), hormones in women (65.1%), not eating (57.3%), weather (53.2%), sleep disturbance (49.8%), perfume or odour (43.7%), neck pain (38.4%), light(s) (38.1%), alcohol (37.8%), smoke (35.7%), sleeping late (32.0%), heat (30.3%), food (26.9%), exercise (22.1%) and sexual activity (5.2%). Triggers were more likely to be associated with a more florid acute migraine attack. Differences were seen between women and men, aura and no aura, episodic and chronic migraine, and between migraine and probable migraine.

### Effect of adrenomedullin on migraine-like attacks in patients with migraine: a randomized crossover study [^115Y8LsF]. Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To determine whether the IV infusion of adrenomedullin, a potent vasodilator belonging to calcitonin family of peptides, provokes attacks of migraine in patients.

Methods

Twenty patients with migraine without aura participated in a placebo-controlled and double-blind clinical study. In a randomized crossover design, the patients received an IV infusion of human adrenomedullin (19.9 pmol/kg/min) or placebo (saline) administrated via an automated IV pump (20 minutes). The patients participated in 2 study days with a washout period of minimum of 7 days. The primary outcome of the study was predefined as a difference in migraine incidence (0–12 hours), and the secondary outcomes were the area under curve (AUC 0–12 hours) for the headache intensity score and AUC 0–90 minutes for mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), flushing, and heart rate (HR).

Results

Eleven patients with migraine without aura (55%) fulfilled migraine attacks criteria after adrenomedullin infusion compared to only 3 patients who reported attack (15%) after placebo (p = 0.039). We found that patients reported in a period of 0 to 12 hours stronger headache intensity after adrenomedullin compared to placebo infusion (p = 0.035). AUC 0–90 minutes value for HR and flushing (p < 0.05) was significant and for MAP (p = 0.502) remained unchanged. Common reported adverse events were facial flushing, heat sensation, and palpitation (p < 0.001).

Conclusion

Our data implicate adrenomedullin in migraine pathogenesis. This suggests that adrenomedullin or its receptors are novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of migraine. However, we cannot discount the possibility that adrenomedullin may be acting through the canonical calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor.

### Migraine does not affect pain intensity perception: a cross-sectional study [^112p9qeq]. Pain Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To explore perceived pain intensity (PPI) in three drug-naïve patient groups characterized by homogeneous migraine phenotypes-migraine without aura without cutaneous allodynia (MwoA CA-), MwoA with ictal CA (MwoA CA+), and migraine with aura without cutaneous allodynia (MwA CA-)-compared with age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HCs).

Methods

Using trigeminal heat stimulation (THS) at three different predefined intensities (41°C, 51°C, and 53°C) performed by the contact heat-evoked potential stimulator (CHEPS), PPI was investigated in 34 patients with MwoA CA-, 30 patients with MwoA CA+, and 30 patients with MwA CA- compared with 30 age- and sex-matched HCs. The patients had never taken migraine-preventive drugs, and they were investigated during an interictal period to avoid confounds associated with migraine attack. Secondary analyses evaluated associations between PPI and clinical features of migraine in patients.

Results

No significant differences were observed between the four groups for each experimentally induced stimulus. Moreover, no significant correlations were found between clinical variables and the PPI of the THS at any level of experimental stimulus.

Conclusions

Despite the converging evidence of pain threshold abnormalities in migraine patients, our findings suggest that migraine patients did not exhibit differences in the PPI of THS when compared with HCs, independent of phenotype and migraine severity, as well as somatic, psychiatric, or pharmacological interferences. This may depend on both the nature of the pain stimulus experienced and the involvement of selective regions or specific pain processing pathways.

### Are some patient-perceived migraine triggers simply early manifestations of the attack? [^112qjRkg]. Journal of Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Subject recruitment

Subjects with migraine were identified through online advertisements, bulletins, patient group advertising and university advertising and through local and national headache clinics. The inclusion criteria for the study included a diagnosis of migraine with or without aura, using ICHD-3 beta, which was in use at the time of the study. We identified subjects with up to 22 headache days a month, a history of spontaneous premonitory symptoms with attacks, and no medical or psychiatric contraindications to study participation and/or NTG exposure. Use of any oral single agent oral preventive therapy for migraine was allowed. Exclusion criteria included medication overuse, illicit drug use, excess alcohol consumption and smoking. Use of more than one oral preventive agent for migraine, the use of neuromodulatory devices, or both, and onabotulinum toxin type A and/or greater occipital nerve injections within the past 3 months were also excluded.

Given the generally poor ability of NTG to trigger aura, we did not anticipate that aura would be triggered in the study and act as a potential confound to identification of premonitory symptoms. We included subjects on single agent preventive therapy to aid recruitment, noting that it has never been systematically studied if the use of migraine preventive agents alters the reporting of premonitory symptoms. Recruitment was completed from February 2015 to July 2017.

Sample size

The initial nitroglycerin triggering study, from which these data are extracted, aimed to study sufficient subjects exposed to nitroglycerin to exceed our previous experience. We, therefore, aimed to expose at least 50 subjects to nitroglycerin.

### Diagnostic and therapeutic aspects of hemiplegic migraine [^114rTpR1]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Treatment

As there are no randomised controlled trials in patients with HM, the treatment remains empirical, similarly to the more common types of migraine, based on small studies and single reports.

The management of HM relies on the control of triggering factors and sometimes severe attacks can require hospitalisation to ensure fluid balance and food intake. Fever and seizures can be treated symptomatically. There are reports of exacerbations due to vasoconstrictive drugs (ergotamine and dihydroergotamine) in patients with HM, raising the concern that vasoconstriction might aggravate the aura. As a consequence, the use of triptans is debated and they are historically contraindicated; hence patients with HM have been excluded from clinical trials. In a retrospective study, triptans appeared to be effective in the treatment of headache; of interest, about half of patients preferred to use triptans during aura as opposed to patients with migraine with aura. Finally, in a single case, a woman affected by HM worsened after starting prophylactic treatment with topiramate. Hence, a medication that can abolish the long-lasting and bothersome aura symptoms is in demand. Many authors support the idea that the propagation of CSD, mediated by the release of glutamate and activation of NMDA receptors, may be the correct target for the acute management of the aura. According to this theory, any medications that inhibit CSD might be useful in the treatment of aura. Nasal administration of ketamine reduced the duration of the aura in patients with FHM. Furosemide and magnesium exploit a similar mechanism acting in CSD. Moreover, intravenous verapamil has shown to be effective for the recovery of both headache and aura in three out of four patients with HM in a single report. Moreover, a prompt recovery has been described in three patients with CACNA1A mutations through the combined use of steroids and hypertonic solutions in course of encephalopathy and cerebral oedema. However, the current evidence is still based on single reports or studies on a small cohort of patients, often lacking a confirmed genetic diagnosis of HM.

Current therapeutic recommendations are based on isolated reports and suggest a possible prophylactic treatment with verapamil and acetazolamide to reduce frequency and severity of migraine attacks, but many new agents have been proposed(table 3).

### Dynamic optimization of chronic migraine treatment: current and future options [^112qPLJY]. Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

Comparator studies that assess treatment effects in a clinical setting have improved the understanding of the efficacy and tolerability of prophylactic treatments for chronic migraine (CM). It is premature to recommend device-based treatments, such as occipital nerve stimulation, vagal nerve stimulation, and patent foramen ovale closure for CM, because clinical trials are in the preliminary stages. Physical therapy techniques, like applying heat or cold packs, ultrasonography, and electrical stimulation, have been shown to lessen pain. Nonpharmacologic treatments, including cognitive behavioral therapy, stress management, and biofeedback, have been investigated and proved effective in some areas of pain management, including migraine. However, pharmacologic interventions may be necessary for effective, long-term prophylaxis. Several medications under investigation, including topiramate, gabapentin, tizanidine, and amitriptyline, have proved efficacious in reducing the number of migraine episodes and the pain associated with migraine, although adverse events may prevent continued use of some agents. Evidence supports the use of botulinum toxin type A (BoNT-A) for CM, with or without medication overuse, to achieve a significant reduction in headache episodes. Efficacy of BoNT-A for CM is comparable with or better than that of valproate and topiramate, with better tolerability. Predictors of response to BoNT-A for CM appear to include predominantly unilateral location of the headache and the presence of cutaneous or muscle allodynia. BoNT-A has been demonstrated to be safe and well tolerated, with rare discontinuations due to adverse events. Recent clinical trials indicate that rational combination therapy may have a place in treating refractory CM. Well-controlled multicenter trials are awaited.

MARLISSA®(levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets) is contraindicated in females who have headaches with focal neurological symptoms or have migraine headaches with aura, and in women over age 35 years who have migraine headaches with or without aura (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).

If a woman using MARLISSA®(levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets) develops new headaches that are recurrent, persistent, or severe, evaluate the cause and discontinue MARLISSA®if indicated. Consider discontinuation of MARLISSA®if there is an increased frequency or severity of migraines during COC use (which may be prodromal of a cerebrovascular event).

### Norethindrone acetate / ethinyl estradiol (Femlyv) [^115RPFSp]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.3 Migraine

FEMLYV is contraindicated in females who have migraines with aura [see Contraindications (4)]. Discontinue FEMLYV in females using FEMLYV who develop new migraines that are recurrent, persistent, or severe. Discontinue FEMLYV if there is an increased frequency or severity of migraines during CHC use (which may be prodromal of a cerebrovascular event).

Migraines with aura increase the risk for stroke. This stroke risk is further increased in females who have migraines with aura with use of CHCs.

5.4 Malignant Neoplasms

Breast Cancer

FEMLYV is contraindicated in females who currently have or have had breast cancer because breast cancer may be hormonally sensitive [see Contraindications (4)].

Epidemiology studies have not found a consistent association between use of combined oral contraceptives (COCs) and breast cancer risk. Studies do not show an association between ever (current or past) use of COCs and risk of breast cancer. However, some studies report a small increase in the risk of breast cancer among current or recent users (< 6 months since last use) and current users with longer duration of COC use [see Postmarketing Experience (6.2)].

Cervical Cancer

A causal relationship between the use of CHCs and the development of cervical cancer and intraepithelial neoplasia has not been clearly established. In observational studies, the use of oral hormonal contraceptives in females for five years or more, compared to females who did not use oral hormonal contraceptives, was associated with an increased risk of cervical cancer and intraepithelial neoplasia. In these studies, the use of oral hormonal contraceptives in females for 10 years or more, compared to females who received oral hormonal contraceptives for 5–9 years, was associated with an increased risk of cervical cancer and intraepithelial neoplasia. Limitations in these epidemiologic studies include potential recall bias, differences in sexual behavior, and other factors such as establishing whether there were data on persistent high-risk Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) infection.

### Neurostimulation in the treatment of primary headaches [^114kd78b]. Practical Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Using SpringTMS

Box 4 gives our recommended regimens for SpringTMS in acute migraine attacks. The device is held against the occiput and the pulse delivered with the press of a button (figure 4). The device should be used as early as possible into a migraine attack. Following review, the clinician can adapt the number of pulses delivered if needed. Patients should use the device for at least 3 months to assess efficacy as there is some evidence of an increased benefit at 12 weeks compared with 6 weeks. Reported side effects are transient and mild; these include dizziness, light-headedness, tingling and worsening of migraine pain. Table 2 lists its contraindications.

Box 4
Using SpringTMS for the acute treatment of migraine with and without aura

Use the device at onset of migraine symptoms of pain and/or aura.

The device is held against the occiput and a button pressed to initiate the pulse.

For acute treatment of migraine:

Deliver two sequential pulses as early as possible into the attack.

Continue delivering two pulses every 15 min for 2 h or until attack resolves.

After first month, reassess and, if needed, increase to three pulses with each treatment.

After second month, reassess and, if needed, increase to four pulses delivered with each treatment.

Some controversy exists regarding contraceptive management in women with migraines, particularly migraines with aura.

However, it should be avoided in women with migraine with aura and women with simple migraines who have other risk factors for stroke. Progestin only contraceptives as well as the copper intrauterine device can be safely used in women with migraines. Accurate classification of a patient's headache type can avoid unnecessary restriction of effective contraceptive methods, particularly those containing estrogen.

### Guidelines of the international headache society for controlled trials of acute treatment of migraine attacks in adults: fourth edition [^113Z9CMo]. Cephalalgia (2019). Medium credibility.

1.1.2. Other primary headaches

Recommendations:

1.1.2.1. Individuals satisfying criteria for chronic migraine or with a history of chronic migraine in the last 12 months should be excluded from pivotal efficacy trials for the acute treatment of migraine. In subsequent trials, exploration of the benefits of new acute treatments in subjects with chronic migraine is needed.

1.1.2.2. Subjects with other concomitant primary headache types (e.g. tension-type headache) are allowed if attacks are infrequent (i.e. present on an average of < 1 day/month and < 12 days/year) and can be differentiated from migraine based on the quality of pain and associated symptoms.

Comments:

Individuals with chronic migraine are excluded from the initial clinical trials of acute treatment because they may complicate analyses of efficacy in undifferentiated populations (refer to for guidance about trials evaluating preventive treatments in adults with chronic migraine). Subjects with migraine may have other primary headache types, including tension-type headache. Those experiencing primary headaches that cannot be distinguished from ICHD-defined migraine without aura should be excluded.

1.1.3. Secondary headaches

Recommendation:

Individuals with secondary headaches, including medication-overuse headache, should be excluded.

Comments:

Excessive use of acute medications for migraine does not necessarily lead to medication-overuse headache, and some individuals may fulfil IHS criteria for overuse of acute medications without suffering from a chronic pattern of headache. The secondary headache exclusion also applies to these subjects.

### Efficacy and safety of eptinezumab in patients with migraine and self-reported aura: post hoc analysis of PROMISE-1 and PROMISE-2 [^1138K8G4]. Cephalalgia (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Migraine with aura is a distinct diagnosis characterized by the presence of one or more fully reversible focal neurologic symptoms (Table 1), which are usually followed by headache and associated migraine symptoms. Most patients with migraine with aura report visual disturbances, such as visual scintillations and scotoma, that spread gradually over ≥ 5 minutes, last 5‒60 minutes, and precede headache onset within 60 minutes. Migraine with aura reportedly comprises approximately one-third of all migraine diagnoses and has been associated with increased risk of cerebro- and cardiovascular disease.

Table 1.
Migraine with aura diagnostic criteria.

Eptinezumab is a humanized immunoglobulin G1 monoclonal antibody specific for calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and is indicated for the preventive treatment of migraine in adults. In the pivotal PROMISE-1 and PROMISE-2 trials, eptinezumab 100 mg and 300 mg, the approved dose levels, met the primary efficacy endpoint; that is, they statistically significantly reduced mean monthly migraine days (MMDs) over Weeks 1–12 in patients with migraine, with sustained efficacy occurring as early as Day 1 after infusion. Given the high prevalence of migraine with aura, the associated medical risks, and the scarcity of published data specific to this population, we conducted a post hoc subgroup analysis of pooled data from the PROMISE trials to assess the efficacy and safety of eptinezumab for the preventive treatment of migraine in patients who self-reported a history of aura, potentially in addition to their migraines without aura.

Methods

Participants

We recruited participants from physicians' referrals and local advertisements at two outpatient sites: one site with two offices serving greater Columbus, Ohio, and one site in Athens, Ohio, serving rural southeastern Ohio. Inclusion criteria were age 18 to 65 years, diagnosis of migraine (with or without aura) according to the international classification of headache disorders criteria at two separate evaluations during the evaluation clinic visit, and diary confirmed criteria for severity of migraine during the optimised acute treatment run-in of at least three migraines with disability per 30 days. Exclusion criteria were diagnosis of probable medication overuse headache according to the international classification of headache disorders criteria, a pain disorder other than migraine as the primary presenting problem, 20 or more days with headache a month, contraindication or sensitivity to any study drug, current use of migraine preventive drugs (with participant's preference or welfare contraindicating withdrawal), current psychological treatment, psychiatric disorder needing immediate or priority treatment, and inability to read and understand the study materials; for women, current or planned breast feeding or pregnancy or unwillingness to use an established contraceptive method were also exclusion criteria. All participants gave written informed consent.

### Prevalence, severity, and associated factors in women in east Asia with moderate-to-severe vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause [^111Xtb88]. Menopause (2022). Medium credibility.

Survey part II

Only participants with moderate-to-severe VMS, based on the US FDA 2003 Guideline criteria, who had completed the Part I survey were eligible to complete Part II of the survey. Moderate VMS was defined as "Sensation of heat with sweating, able to continue activity" and severe VMS was defined as "Sensation of heat with sweating, causing cessation of activity. " Part II of the survey collected information on clinical characteristics, participants' eligibility and willingness to take HT, HRQoL, treatment landscape, and healthcare-seeking behavior and key driving factors.

Objectives and endpoints

The primary objective was to estimate the prevalence of menopausal VMS and moderate-to-severe VMS in perimenopausal or postmenopausal women living in East Asia, and assess their eligibility and willingness to receive HT. Menopausal VMS was defined as sensation of heat with/without sweating, based on US FDA Guidelines. Primary endpoints included VMS prevalence and severity and the proportion of women self-reporting eligibility and willingness to take menopausal HT. HT subgroups among the peri- or postmenopausal women aged 40 to 65 years with moderate-to-severe menopause related VMS were defined as follows:

HT-willing: receiving HT for menopause-related VMS.
HT-averse: discontinued HT, or decided not to receive HT despite being HT-eligible based on clinical advice.
HT-contraindicated: presenting with any of the following underlying conditions: abnormal or unexplained vaginal bleeding, severe active liver disease, deep vein thrombosis, endometrial/uterine cancer, ovarian cancer, stroke/angina pectoris/ myocardial infaction, other contraindications based on local clinical inputs, including breast cancer, coronary heart disease, dementia, embolism, porphyria cutanea tarda, hypertriglyceridemia, endometriosis, migraine, and leiomyosarcoma.
HT-stoppers: had received HT but discontinued due to various reasons.
HT-caution per physician's advice: advised by a physician that they were HT-ineligible due to contraindications or high-risk comorbidity, but did not disclose the specific condition(s).
HT-caution due to high-risk comorbidity: presenting with any of the following risk factors: current smokers, any first- degree relatives with history of breast, endometrial/uterine or ovarian cancer, high cholesterol, hypertriglyceridemia, migraine, diabetes.

5.8 Headache

Levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets is contraindicated in females who have headaches with focal neurological symptoms or have migraine headaches with aura, and in women over age 35 years who have migraine headaches with or without aura [see Contraindications (4)].

If a female taking levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets develop new headaches that are recurrent, persistent, or severe, evaluate the cause and discontinue levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets if indicated.

Consider discontinuation of levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets if there is an increased frequency or severity of migraine during COC use (which may be prodromal of a cerebrovascular event) [see Contraindications (4)].

5.9 Bleeding Irregularities and Amenorrhea

Bleeding and/or spotting that occurs at any time while taking the first 84 tablets of each extended-cycle regimen is considered "unscheduled" bleeding/spotting. Bleeding that occurs during the time a woman takes the seven white inert tablets is considered "scheduled" bleeding.

Unscheduled Bleeding and Spotting

Females using levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets may experience unscheduled (breakthrough or intracyclic) bleeding and spotting especially during the first 3 months of use. Bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or by changing to a different contraceptive product. If unscheduled bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles evaluate for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy.

Before prescribing levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets, advise the woman to weigh the occurrence of fewer scheduled menses (4 per year instead of 13 per year) against the occurrence of increased unscheduled bleeding and/or spotting.

The clinical trial of the efficacy of levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets (91-day cycles) in preventing pregnancy also assessed scheduled and unscheduled bleeding. The participants in the study were composed primarily of women who had used oral contraceptives previously as opposed to new users. Women with a history of breakthrough bleeding/spotting ≥ 10 consecutive days on oral contraceptives were excluded from the study. More levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets subjects, compared to subjects on the comparator 28-day cycle regimen, discontinued prematurely for unacceptable bleeding (7.7% [levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets] vs. 1.8% [28-day cycle regimen]).

### Sporadic and familial hemiplegic migraine: pathophysiological mechanisms, clinical characteristics, diagnosis, and management [^114YvqbQ]. The Lancet: Neurology (2011). Medium credibility.

Hemiplegic migraine is a rare form of migraine with aura that involves motor aura (weakness). This type of migraine can occur as a sporadic or a familial disorder. Familial forms of hemiplegic migraine are dominantly inherited. Data from genetic studies have implicated mutations in genes that encode proteins involved in ion transportation. However, at least a quarter of the large families affected and most sporadic cases do not have a mutation in the three genes known to be implicated in this disorder, suggesting that other genes are still to be identified. Results from functional studies indicate that neuronal hyperexcitability has a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of hemiplegic migraine. The clinical manifestations of hemiplegic migraine range from attacks with short-duration hemiparesis to severe forms with recurrent coma and prolonged hemiparesis, permanent cerebellar ataxia, epilepsy, transient blindness, or mental retardation. Diagnosis relies on a careful patient history and exclusion of potential causes of symptomatic attacks. The principles of management are similar to those for common varieties of migraine, except that vasoconstrictors, including triptans, are historically contraindicated but are often used off-label to stop the headache, and prophylactic treatment can include lamotrigine and acetazolamide.

### Migraine with visual aura is a risk factor for incident atrial fibrillation: a cohort study [^114sCowD]. Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Assessment of migraine

Trained interviewers administered a headache questionnaire to participants during visit 3. Modified ICHD-3diagnostic criteria were applied to data collected in this questionnaire to differentiate migraine with visual aura and migraine without visual aura. Having a migraine was defined by participant responses endorsing headaches lasting at least 4 hours or longer in duration. Headaches were characterized with symptoms of throbbing or pulsating pain, and were mostly on one side. In addition to those symptoms, headaches were also accompanied by photophobia and phonophobia or nausea or vomiting. Headaches were differentiated into 2 categories: migraine with visual aura and migraine without visual aura. Participants with migraine with visual aura reported seeing spots, jagged lines, or heat waves in one or both eyes before onset of headache. Other types of auras (speech/language, motor sensory, and brainstem) that are less common were not assessed. Headaches lasting more than 4 hours that did not match requirements for either category were classified as nonmigraine headaches. Lastly, participants without a history of experiencing headaches more than 4 hours were categorized as the no-headache group. Those with nonmigraine headaches were not included in the analysis. Comparing this method of applying the modified ICHD-3 criteria to the headache data in ARIC to when the participant reported that a physician had made a migraine diagnosis (visit 3), we determined that the former had a positive predictive value of 95%.

### Drospirenone and estetrol (Nextstellis) [^113cs719]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

5.2 Hyperkalemia

NEXTSTELLIS is contraindicated in females with conditions that predispose to hyperkalemia (e.g., renal impairment, hepatic impairment, and adrenal insufficiency). Females receiving daily, long-term treatment for chronic conditions or diseases with medications that may increase serum potassium concentration should have their serum potassium concentration checked during the first treatment cycle. Monitor serum potassium concentration in females at increased risk for hyperkalemia (i.e., those females who take a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor long-term and concomitantly with NEXTSTELLIS) [see Drug interactions (7)]. Monitor females taking NEXTSTELLIS who later develop medical conditions and/or begin medication that put them at an increased risk for hyperkalemia.

NEXTSTELLIS contains drospirenone, a progestin, which has anti-mineralocorticoid activity, including the potential for hyperkalemia in high-risk females, comparable to a 25 mg dose of spironolactone. In two Phase 3 trials of NEXTSTELLIS (N = 3,632) for the prevention of pregnancy in females 16–50 years of age, seven subjects were noted to have hyperkalemia and one subject discontinued due to elevated potassium levels. Most females who developed hyperkalemia in the clinical development studies of NEXTSTELLIS had only mild potassium elevations and/or isolated increases that returned to normal while still on study medication.

5.3 Hypertension

NEXTSTELLIS is contraindicated in females with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease [see Contraindications (4)]. For all females, including those with well-controlled hypertension, monitor blood pressure periodically and stop NEXTSTELLIS if blood pressure rises significantly.

An increase in blood pressure has been reported in females using COCs. This increase is more likely in older females with extended duration of use.

5.4 Migraine

NEXTSTELLIS is contraindicated in females who have migraines with aura [see Contraindications (4)]. Discontinue NEXTSTELLIS in females using NEXTSTELLIS who develop new migraines that are recurrent, persistent, or severe. Discontinue NEXTSTELLIS if there is an increased frequency or severity of migraines during CHC use (which may be prodromal of a cerebrovascular event).

Migraines with aura increase the risk for stroke. This stroke risk is further increased in females who have migraines with aura with use of CHCs.

### Guidelines of the international headache society for controlled trials of acute treatment of migraine attacks in adults: fourth edition [^116XHMJM]. Cephalalgia (2019). Medium credibility.

1.2.5. Stratification

Recommendations:

1.2.5.1. There is usually no need for stratification in acute treatment trials.

1.2.5.2. Stratification may be considered when an imbalance between the treatment groups or an important factor may influence the results of a trial.

Comments:

Randomization alone may not ensure full comparability between subjects in different treatment groups, especially in smaller trials, and stratified randomization is sometimes used to circumvent potential imbalances. The EMA recommends that stratification variables usually be included as covariates in primary analyses, regardless of their prognostic value. In controlled trials for migraine, the use of stratification by prognostic factors should be limited to a few variables and only to those that have historically demonstrated effects on primary efficacy endpoint(s). Stratification variables that have been used in acute treatment trials include age, body weight, headache intensity at baseline, migraine type (i.e. with or without aura), menstrual versus non-menstrual attacks, and concomitant preventive treatment. Given the preponderance of females with migraine, sex may also be used as a stratification factor to control for imbalances in treatment groups.

1.2.6. Intention to treat

Recommendations:

1.2.6.1. Randomized controlled trials of acute treatments for migraine should follow the principle of intention to treat (ITT), which implies that analyses should include all randomised subjects in the groups to which they were randomly assigned, regardless of treatment received.

1.2.6.2. The full analysis set may be modified to exclude subjects from the analysis if no treatment was taken or if no data points after treatment were recorded. A plan should be provided prospectively as to how participants missing the 2-hour endpoint or who treat but do not record data will be handled. Those who treat but do not record data should probably be counted as failures, and those who use rescue medication before the 2-hour time assessment should be counted as failures.

Comments:

The ITT principle encourages, where reasonable, the inclusion of subjects who withdrew, were lost to follow-up, or did not fully adhere to trial protocol. The ITT principle should be adhered to when the primary outcome is a variable that measures a change from baseline to any post-dose time point or to the end of the trial. When the primary outcome is defined as a rate of change, and the analysis will therefore imply a slope or rate of calculation, only subjects who have received at least one dose and recorded at least one data point should be included.

Triptans in pregnancy and breast feeding?

The major concern for migraine medications during pregnancy is of potential teratogenicity; our practice during pregnancy is to continue triptans only if benefit outweighs risk. The sumatriptan pregnancy register (626 pregnancies exposed to sumatriptan) has highlighted that the risk of first trimester birth defects was 4.2%, versus 3–5% in the general population. There are fewer data for other triptans. The current NICE CG150 headache guideline states that triptans can and should be considered for pregnant patients experiencing disabling headache attacks when other therapies have proven unhelpful and when patients have been counselled about their use in pregnancy. Triptans are generally considered compatible with breast feeding as less than 10% of the drug dose appears in breast milk; however, there are no large studies in this area.

Should we use triptans in patients with migraine aura?

Auras were previously thought to represent a vasoconstrictive episode and consequently there was concern about using triptans, which cause vasoconstriction, as this might in theory predispose to stroke. However, current understanding is that cortical spreading depression underlies aura, calling into question this theoretical contraindication. Studies of triptan use in familial hemiplegic aura report an excellent response to triptans and only minor side effects. Opinions vary among headache physicians, depending on the type of aura. Triptans are generally prescribed for migraine associated with non-motor aura. However, for hemiplegic migraine and also basilar migraine, there is less consensus, but the potential benefit of triptans may well outweigh their theoretical risks.

Migraine prevention

Migraine preventative treatments aim to reduce the frequency and severity of attacks and may help reduce the frequency of analgesic use. It is usually unrealistic for patients to expect complete headache cessation and it can be useful to have a discussion with patients about realistic goals of treatment. Prophylactic treatment is typically considered if there are more than four migraine days per month. However, preventative therapy may also be given for less frequent but very disabling attacks.

Most medications used as preventatives were originally used for a different indication, and the evidence for individual agents varies. The agents used can be classified into antiepileptic drugs, beta blockers, antidepressants, serotonergic antagonists (methysergide is no longer manufactured), calcium channel antagonists, angiotensin modulators (ACE inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor inhibitors), nutrients and herbal products (Feverfew).

### Migraine with brainstem aura accompanied by disorders of consciousness [^116FGcQu]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Migraine with brainstem aura (MBA) accompanied by disorders of consciousness (DOC) is a rare subtype of migraine. The pathophysiology of MBA with DOC has not been elucidated yet. Some patients have a family history of migraine, and women are more affected than men. The aura symptoms are diverse; however, when MBA is combined with DOC, the clinical manifestations are more complicated. Coma is the most common clinical manifestation. The overall duration of the patient's DOC is short and can often return to normal within half an hour. Headache often occurs after regaining consciousness and can also occur at the same time as DOC. The most common headache is located at the occipital region. Although DOC is reversible, considering the current small number of cases, we still need to improve our understanding of the disease to avoid misdiagnosis. The MBA patient's electroencephalogram and cerebral blood flow perfusion may have transient changes and may return to normal in the interictal period or after the DOC. Although triptans have traditionally been contraindicated in MBA under drug instructions, the evidence of basilar artery constriction, as postulated in MBA, is lacking. Lasmiditan is currently the first and only 5-HT 1F receptor agonist approved by the Food and Drug Administration. The calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor antagonists and monoclonal antibody therapies may be the most promising for future consideration. Here, the pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, diagnostic tools, and treatment progress for MBA with DOC are reviewed.

Oral contraceptives have been shown to cause glucose intolerance in a significant percentage of users. Carefully monitor females with prediabetes and diabetes who are using levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol. Levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol may decrease glucose tolerance.

A small proportion of women will have persistent hypertriglyceridemia while on COCs. As discussed earlier (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS), changes in serum triglycerides and lipoprotein levels have been reported in oral-contraceptive users.

9. Elevated Blood Pressure

Levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol is contraindicated in women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). For all females, including those with well-controlled hypertension, monitor blood pressure at routine visits and stop levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol if blood pressure rises significantly.

An increase in blood pressure has been reported in females using CHCs, and this increase is more likely in older women with extended duration of use. The effect of CHCs on blood pressure may vary according to the progestin in the CHC.

### Migraine and cardiovascular disease: what cardiologists should know [^114p6PXh]. European Heart Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Migraine is a chronic neurovascular disease with a complex, not fully understood pathophysiology with multiple causes. People with migraine suffer from recurrent moderate to severe headache attacks varying from 4 to 72 h. The prevalence of migraine is two to three times higher in women compared with men. Importantly, it is the most disabling disease in women < 50 years of age due to a high number of years lived with disability, resulting in a very high global socioeconomic burden. Robust evidence exists on the association between migraine with aura and increased incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD), in particular ischaemic stroke. People with migraine with aura have an increased risk of atrial fibrillation, myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular death compared with those without migraine. Ongoing studies investigate the relation between migraine and angina with non-obstructive coronary arteries and migraine patients with patent foramen ovale. Medication for the treatment of migraine can be preventative medication, such as beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers, antiepileptics, antidepressants, some of the long-acting calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor antagonists, or monoclonal antibodies against calcitonin gene-related peptide or its receptor, or acute medication, such as triptans and calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor antagonists. However, these medications might raise concerns when migraine patients also have CVD due to possible (coronary) side effects. Specifically, knowledge gaps remain for the contraindication to newer treatments for migraine. All cardiologists will encounter patients with CVD and migraine. This state-of-the-art review will outline the basic pathophysiology of migraine and the associations between migraine and CVD, discuss current therapies, and propose future directions for research.

### Assessment of erenumab safety and efficacy in patients with migraine with and without aura: a secondary analysis of randomized clinical trials [^1176Prwa]. JAMA Neurology (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Migraine with aura may respond differently to therapies than migraine without aura. Individuals with migraine with aura have an elevated vascular risk, necessitating a safety assessment of migraine preventive treatments in this patient subgroup.

Objective

To assess the efficacy and safety profiles of erenumab in patients with migraine with aura.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This post hoc secondary analysis evaluated 4 double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials that were conducted in treatment centers in North America, Europe, Russia, and Turkey between August 6, 2013, and November 12, 2019. Participants were adults aged 18 to 65 years with episodic migraine or chronic migraine and were randomized to receive either erenumab or placebo.

Interventions

One or more dose of erenumab (70 mg or 140 mg once per month) or placebo was administered by subcutaneous injection in the double-blind treatment phase and open-label or dose-blinded active treatment, and erenumab, 70 mg or 140 mg, was administered once per month by subcutaneous injection during extension phases.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Efficacy assessments included change from baseline monthly migraine days (MMDs) and monthly acute migraine-specific medication (AMSM) days. Safety end points included patient incidences of adverse events. Subgroups of patients were categorized according to their history of aura.

Results

Of the 2682 patients who were randomized in the 4 trials, 1400 (52.2%) received 1 or more dose of erenumab, 70 mg or 140 mg, and 1043 (38.9%) received placebo. Patients had a mean (SD) age of 41.7 (11.2) years and were predominantly women (n = 2055 [84.1%]). Reductions from baseline MMDs and AMSM days were greater in the erenumab than placebo groups in patients with and without a history of aura during the double-blind treatment phase, and these reductions were maintained throughout the extension phases. In patients with episodic migraine and a history of aura, least-squares mean differences in change from baseline MMDs at week 12 were -1.1 (95% CI, -1.7 to -0.6) in those who received erenumab, 70 mg, and -0.9 (95% CI, -1.6 to -0.2) in those who received erenumab, 140 mg, compared with placebo. In patients with chronic migraine with a history of aura, the least-squares mean differences from placebo treatment were -2.1 (95% CI, -3.8 to -0.5) in those who received erenumab, 70 mg, and -3.1 (95% CI, -4.8 to -1.4) in those who received erenumab, 140 mg. Overall safety profiles were similar across treatment groups regardless of aura history and were comparable to that of placebo over 12 weeks, with no increased emergence of adverse events over time.

Conclusions and Relevance

Results of this secondary analysis of 4 randomized clinical trials showed reduced migraine frequency and AMSM days with erenumab treatment in patients with migraine with and without a history of aura. The findings support the efficacy and safety of using erenumab in this patient population.

### Efficacy and safety of eptinezumab in patients with migraine and self-reported aura: post hoc analysis of PROMISE-1 and PROMISE-2 [^111xYHDW]. Cephalalgia (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

The full methodologies of PROMISE-1 (NCT02559895) and PROMISE-2 (NCT02974153) have been published; key elements are reviewed here. Both studies were conducted in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice guidelines, the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, and all applicable local regulatory requirements. Independent ethics committee or institutional review board approval was obtained for each study site, with all patients providing written informed consent prior to study participation.

Both studies were phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trials that evaluated the preventive efficacy, tolerability, and safety of eptinezumab in adults with migraine. PROMISE-1 enrolled patients with episodic migraine (EM) and PROMISE-2 enrolled patients with chronic migraine (CM). Migraine was defined using the International Classification for Headache Disorders (ICHD) definitions for migraine broadly. Patients separately reported any experience of aura with their migraine, being asked if they experience aura at the screening visit (and if it was ever experienced without headache pain). To improve the accuracy of self-reporting, investigators confirmed each patient's understanding of aura during the screening visit and provided additional description and/or explanation, if needed. Educational materials pertaining to aura were also provided as part of electronic Diary (eDiary) training. The guide for investigators when discussing aura with patients included the following points of education, which were in alignment with ICHD criteria (Table 1): (a) Aura may affect vision, senses, speech or language, movement, and balance; (b) Sometimes an aura symptom may be followed by a second or third symptom of aura; (c) The symptoms may sometimes begin on one side of the head or body; (d) Each aura symptom may last anywhere from 5 minutes to an hour or more; (e) When the aura is related to a migraine, the migraine headache usually occurs within an hour of the aura. Visual aura was described as when vision is disturbed by bright, shimmering jagged or zigzag lines that spread, altering more and more in the field of vision. Additional symptoms of migraine with aura that were described included the sensation of pins and needles spreading slowly from one spot on one side of the body, face and/or tongue, which may be followed by numbness, as well as numbness without the pins and needles sensation and sensitivity, and trouble speaking or muscle weakness, clumsiness, or difficulty walking. Patients were told that these symptoms tend to happen about an hour before the start of a migraine but can vary.

### Efficacy and safety of eptinezumab in patients with migraine and self-reported aura: post hoc analysis of PROMISE-1 and PROMISE-2 [^113jG2tR]. Cephalalgia (2022). Medium credibility.

Patients were randomized to receive eptinezumab 30 mg (PROMISE-1 only), 100 mg, 300 mg, or placebo administered intravenously every 12 weeks. Patients in PROMISE-1 received up to four treatments (48 weeks). Patients in PROMISE-2 received up to two treatments (24 weeks).

This post hoc analysis evaluated the efficacy and safety of eptinezumab for the preventive treatment of migraine in the subgroup of patients who self-reported a history of aura at screening in either study. It included only those patients who received approved eptinezumab dose levels (i.e. 100 mg or 300 mg) or placebo. Outcome measures included changes in migraine frequency (i.e. MMDs), migraine responder rates (≥ 50% and ≥ 75%) over Weeks 1–12 and 13–24, percent of migraine attacks with aura, acute medication days, and treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). Patients from PROMISE-1 and PROMISE-2 were pooled for all analyses except for the change from baseline in MMDs due to the differences in patient populations at baseline.

Monthly migraine days were derived from eDiary data and were based on 4-week intervals. A 50% responder was a patient who achieved a ≥ 50% reduction in MMDs, and a 75% responder was a patient who achieved a ≥ 75% reduction in MMDs. These reductions were evaluated by comparing the baseline frequency of migraine days to the migraine frequency in 4-week intervals. Results from the 4-week intervals were combined to produce 12- and 24-week responder endpoints.

In the daily eDiaries, patients indicated whether they experienced aura symptoms as discussed with the investigator during screening with their headache/migraine, which was used to determine the percentage of migraine attacks with aura. Available data from the 4-week intervals was combined to produce an average over 12 weeks. Patients with no migraine during a study were counted as a percentage of zero, and there was no missing data imputation for missing eDiary assessments.

### Migraine with aura and risk of cardiovascular and all cause mortality in men and women: prospective cohort study [^111XVoqo]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Comparison with other studies

This population based cohort study measured mortality from all causes and cardiovascular disease in men and women with migraine separately by aura status. Our findings are consistent with the increasing evidence that migraine, particularly migraine with aura, is associated with cardiovascular disease. Previous reports in which migraine has been shown to be protective for all cause mortalitycould be explained by methodological differences with this study. For example, two of these studieswere based on patient based rather than population based samples. Furthermore, one of these studiesidentified those with migraine based in part on their use of triptans, which are contraindicated in people with risk factors for cardiovascular disease. The aim of the two studieswas not to compare risk in those with and without migraine but to assess possible risk of triptans in people with migraine. The fact that those two studies showed a protective effect could also explain why a recent meta-analysis of five studies (including those two studies) showed no risk for mortality from cardiovascular disease associated with migraine overall (with and without aura combined) (relative risk 1.03, 0.79 to 1.34). Only one study included in that meta-analysis estimated the risk of mortality separately in people with migraine with aura. This study suggested that women with migraine with aura were at about twice the risk of cardiovascular mortality compared with women without headache.

The hazard ratios for mortality for cardiovascular disease in men with migraine were somewhat higher than the corresponding values for all cause mortality. The risk was independent of traditional risk factors for cardiovascular disease measured at baseline. Several studies have reported greater risk of stroke in people with migrainethan in others, especially for those with aura. The risk of coronary heart disease among people with migraine varies more between studies, from being lower than normal to being moderately increased. In our study the risk increase for mortality from coronary heart disease was mainly confined to men with migraine with aura.

The increased risk of overall mortality or mortality related to cardiovascular disease associated with migraine with aura is significant but modest: 20% for women and 20% for men, with respect to all cause mortality, and 18% for women and 42% for men, with respect to cardiovascular disease mortality.

### Ubrogepant in the acute management of migraine: a narrative review [^114MAxhC]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Ubrogepant is a small-molecule calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonist that received Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for the acute treatment of migraine with and without aura in adults. The ACHIEVE I and ACHIEVE II Phase III clinical trials showed that ubrogepant was superior to placebo for pain freedom and freedom of the most bothersome migraine-associated symptom at 2 hours after medication intake. The 52-week open label extension of the Phase III trials demonstrated safety of ubrogepant. A real-world study conducted at a tertiary headache center also confirmed the efficacy and safety of ubrogepant. Adverse event rates were higher in the real-world population. Studies are needed to evaluate its long-term efficacy and safety, especially in the setting of co-administration with other CGRP modulating therapies such as the CGRP monoclonal antibodies.

### Methodology of drug trials in migraine: history and suggestions for the future [^116ERiiY]. Cephalalgia (2024). Medium credibility.

There is a multitude of scientific papers and guideline papers on the methodology of drug trials in migraine. Here, we try to condense this into a single paper and to make proposals for future consideration. Literature known by the authors and from reference lists of relevant publications was used for the history. Relevant literature for our proposals was searched on PubMed. The main headings in published guidelines, namely, Patient selection, Trial design, Evaluation of results and Statistics, have remained unchanged over the years. Most of the methodology has remained unchanged but the changes that have taken place are important. Chronic migraine has been studied separately from episodic migraine, children and adolescents distinguished from adults, and migraine without aura from migraine with aura. In trial design, the group comparison design has taken priority over the cross-over design, but the latter is suggested for investigator driven, comparative, dose finding and aura trials because of its superior power. There is a confusing number of possible primary end points: number of migraine attacks, number of migraine days, number of headache days and number of 50% responders in prophylactic trials, whereas two-hour pain free is agreed in acute trials. However, also 24- and 48-hour pain free have been suggested and headache relief is sometimes still used against recommendations. Most bothersome symptom has been requested as a co-primary end point by Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Our future suggestions are meant to provide food for thought for future committee work. We suggest that most bothersome symptom needs to be discussed with FDA as a co-primary end point in acute trials. It could also be discussed whether episodic- and chronic migraine need separate study. Migraine with- and without aura should be studied separately. Furthermore, two-hour pain free should be maintained as the primary end point but the use of stricter outcome parameters should be explored. In prophylactic trials, migraine days are recommended over migraine attacks and over 50% responders. For investigator-initiated trials, comparative trials and proof of concept trials by small companies, the cross-over design with its superior power is still recommended. Finally, the need to lump various guidelines into one major document should be considered. The methodology of drug trials in migraine has been worked out in detail. It is important that these guidelines be followed in all clinical trials. We highlight several issues that merit attention in the future.

Migraine and the combined contraceptive pill?

Women with migraine and active aura have a twofold increased risk of ischaemic stroke. In women aged less than 45 years, smoking and the combined contraceptive pill further increase the stroke risk.NICE recommends avoiding combined hormonal contraceptives in women who have migraine with aura due to the increased risk of stroke. In these patients, we recommend the progesterone-only pill, contraceptive implant, depot or levonorgesterol intrauterine device.

Treating headache in the emergency department

When managing acute, severe headache in the emergency department, our first concern is to identify red flags (see table 4). An accurate headache history is essential and if a true thunderclap or sinister headache is identified this will need investigating.

Table 4
Secondary headaches presenting to the emergency department

When there is a positive diagnosis of severe migraine, its effective management can ensure high-quality patient care and also facilitates a timely discharge. We offer sumatriptan 6 mg, typically with an antiemetic such as metoclopramide or prochlorperazine. A recent systematic review advised against using morphine, tramadol, intramuscular diclofenac, haloperidol or dexamethasone. A period of intravenous rehydration may also help. It is also essential to make a future management plan to help prevent readmissions, which often are multiple in severe migraineurs. Clinicians can review the need for migraine prophylaxis and abortive therapy as an outpatient. A GON block can help patients in crisis before discharge.

### Migraine and risk of stroke [^115tXYsq]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

MIGRAINE AND VASCULAR RISK FACTORS

The role of conventional vascular risk factors on the risk of cardiovascular events in people with migraine is controversial. Migraine, and particularly MA, is associated with an unfavourable cardiovascular risk profile and an increased 10-year predicted risk of coronary heart disease based on the Framingham Risk Score. Frequent headache and long-term migraine are associated with a poorer cardiovascular risk profile. Although people with migraine have an increased risk of ischaemic stroke in the presence of vascular risk factors, several studies have shown that the association between migraine and ischaemic stroke is apparent in people with low Framingham Risk Score. The few exceptions were a positive association with family history of cardiovascular disease, cigarette smoking and oral contraceptives. This agrees with reports that coronary and carotid arteries of individuals with active migraine are found to be less severely affected by atherosclerosis than individuals without migraine, suggesting a non-atherosclerotic mechanism behind the MA-ischaemic stroke link.

Clinical implication

Most migraine patients have MO and are of no or little increased risk of stroke, and they should be reassured instead of being frightened. People with MA are at increased risk of developing cardio/cerebrovascular disease, and while migraine prevention in people with MA has not been shown to reduce stroke risk, management of vascular risk factors in those with MA is important in reducing stroke risk. Comorbidities should be treated adequately (arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus and dyslipidaemia). Migraine patients with aura should be advised to stop smoking, particularly if they also take oral contraceptives. Oral contraceptive use should be carefully discussed in women with MA because of the increased vascular risk. Their prescription should be contraindicated in women with MA and other comorbid vascular risk factor or congenital or acquired thrombophilia.

### Assessment of erenumab safety and efficacy in patients with migraine with and without aura: a secondary analysis of randomized clinical trials [^1121ZhyB]. JAMA Neurology (2022). High credibility.

In the chronic migraine trial, the mean (SE) number of baseline monthly aura days ranged from 6.5 (0.5) to 7.5 (0.4) days among patients with 1 or more aura days during baseline (eTable 4 in Supplement 6). The change from baseline in monthly aura days did not substantially differ among treatment groups (eTable 4 in Supplement 6).

Safety

Overall safety profiles were similar across treatment groups regardless of aura history (Figure 4; eTable 5 in Supplement 6). In patients without a history of aura, 49.7% (n = 280) in the placebo group vs 46.4% (n = 343) in the erenumab group reported an AE during the double-blind treatment phase. In patients with a history of aura, the AE rates were 47.9% (n = 230) in the placebo group vs 47.7% (n = 315) in the erenumab group. Most AEs that were reported were mild or moderate in severity. Discontinuations because of AEs during the double-blind treatment phase were low in both subgroups but slightly higher in patients with a history of aura who received erenumab (2.3% [n = 15] vs 1.4% [n = 10]) (eTable 5 in Supplement 6).

### Efficacy and safety of eptinezumab in patients with migraine and self-reported aura: post hoc analysis of PROMISE-1 and PROMISE-2 [^114aHDb8]. Cephalalgia (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

This post hoc subgroup analysis evaluated the efficacy and safety of eptinezumab for migraine prevention in patients with migraine and self-reported aura.

Methods

PROMISE-1 (NCT02559895; episodic migraine) and PROMISE-2 (NCT02974153; chronic migraine) were randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials that evaluated eptinezumab for migraine prevention. In both studies, the primary outcome was the mean change from baseline in monthly migraine days over Weeks 1–12. Patients in this analysis included those who self-reported migraine with aura at screening.

Results

Of patients with episodic migraine, ∼75% reported a history of aura at screening; of patients with chronic migraine, ∼35% reported a history of aura. Changes in monthly migraine days over Weeks 1–12 were –4.0 (100 mg) and –4.2 (300 mg) with eptinezumab versus –3.1 with placebo in patients with episodic migraine with aura, and were –7.1 (100 mg) and –7.6 (300 mg) with eptinezumab versus –6.0 with placebo in patients with chronic migraine with aura. Treatment-emergent adverse events were reported by 56.0% (100 mg), 57.4% (300 mg), and 55.4% (placebo) of patients.

Conclusions

The preventive migraine efficacy of eptinezumab in patients in the PROMISE studies who self-reported aura was comparable to the overall study populations, demonstrating a similarly favorable safety and tolerability profile.

### Migraine: preventive treatment [^1114kAYC]. Cephalalgia (2002). Low credibility.

Migraine is a common episodic headache disorder. A comprehensive headache treatment plan includes acute attack treatment to relieve pain and impairment and long-term preventive therapy to reduce attack frequency, severity, and duration. Circumstances that might warrant preventive treatment include: (i) migraine that significantly interferes with the patient's daily routine despite acute treatment; (ii) failure, contraindication to, or troublesome side-effects from acute medications; (iii) overuse of acute medications; (iv) special circumstances, such as hemiplegic migraine; (v) very frequent headaches (more than two a week); or (vi) patient preference. Start the drug at a low dose. Give each treatment an adequate trial. Avoid interfering, overused, and contraindicated drugs. Re-evaluate therapy. Be sure that a woman of childbearing potential is aware of any potential risks. Involve patients in their care to maximize compliance. Consider co-morbidity. Choose a drug based on its proven efficacy, the patient's preferences and headache profile, the drug's side-effects, and the presence or absence of coexisting or co-morbid disease. Drugs that have documented high efficacy and mild to moderate adverse events (AEs) include beta-blockers, amitriptyline, and divalproex. Drugs that have lower documented efficacy and mild to moderate AEs include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), calcium channel antagonists, gabapentin, topiramate, riboflavin, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

### Highlights of prescribing information… [^1153rn5r]. FDA (DailyMed) (2019). Medium credibility.

Hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema and anaphylaxis, have occurred in patients receiving sumatriptan. Such reactions can be life threatening or fatal. In general, anaphylactic reactions to drugs are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. TOSYMRA is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to sumatriptan. In an open-label study that was designed to evaluate the local tolerability of TOSYMRA, repeated use of TOSYMRA was allowed over the course of 6 months. In this study, local irritative symptoms were reported in approximately 46% of patients treated with TOSYMRA, the most common of which were application site reactions, dysgeusia, and throat irritation. Cardiovascular: Hypotension, palpitations. Neurological: Dystonia, tremor. Ergot-containing drugs have been reported to cause prolonged vasospastic reactions.

Because these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine-containing or ergot-type medications and TOSYMRA within 24 hours of each other is contraindicated. MAO-A inhibitors increase systemic exposure by 2-fold. Therefore, the use of TOSYMRA in patients receiving MAO-A inhibitors is contraindicated. Because their vasospastic effects may be additive, coadministration of TOSYMRA and other 5-HT1 agonists within 24 hours of each other is contraindicated. Adverse reactions observed in these clinical trials were similar in nature to those reported in clinical trials in adults. The frequency of all adverse reactions in these patients appeared to be both dose- and age-dependent, with younger patients reporting reactions more commonly than older pediatric patients. Coronary vasospasm was observed after intravenous administration of sumatriptan injection.

Overdoses would be expected from animal data to possibly cause convulsions, tremor, inactivity, erythema of the extremities, reduced respiratory rate, cyanosis, ataxia, mydriasis, injection site reactions, and paralysis.
