## Question

No, list ssri for anxiety disorders with no effect on weight

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which SSRIs are appropriate for anxiety disorders and have no effect on weight. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which SSRIs are actually indicated or commonly used for anxiety disorders. Then, I should verify the weight-effect profiles of each SSRI across acute and long-term treatment. Next, I will check whether any SSRI truly has "no effect" on weight or if the claim is too strong. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified list and note monitoring and alternatives if weight neutrality is paramount.

> Let me first confirm the SSRI landscape for anxiety. SSRIs and SNRIs are first-line pharmacotherapy for generalized anxiety disorder, and SSRIs are also first-line for social anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and OCD, with sertraline, escitalopram, paroxetine, fluoxetine, citalopram, and fluvoxamine as the principal agents used in practice and guidelines, though individual SSRIs vary in regulatory approvals and evidence base by disorder [^01908ae8] [^41b00fe4].

> Wait, let me verify the weight-effect claim before I jump ahead. The premise that any SSRI has "no effect" on weight is too absolute; across the class, weight effects vary by agent, dose, duration, and individual susceptibility, and even agents with relatively favorable profiles can show small average changes over time, so I should frame this as "weight-neutral or minimal effect" rather than "no effect" [^21cbea1c] [^37dcc518].

> I will now examine fluoxetine. In the acute phase (about 4–12 weeks), fluoxetine is associated with modest weight loss or weight neutrality, but over longer-term maintenance (> 4 months), weight tends to normalize toward baseline, so it is not weight-neutral in all phases; still, compared with several peers, its long-term weight liability is lower, making it a reasonable choice when minimizing weight gain is a priority [^21cbea1c] [^37dcc518].

> Next, I should review sertraline. Hold on, I should double-check the directionality. In pediatric MDD trials, sertraline showed a small mean weight loss versus placebo over 10 weeks, and in longer-term observational data, sertraline has among the lowest average weight gain among first-line antidepressants, though absolute gains are small; thus, sertraline is generally considered weight-neutral or low risk for gain in many patients, albeit with interindividual variability [^280cf22a] [^eacd3420].

> Let me consider escitalopram. Randomized data in GAD show minimal mean weight change over 24 weeks (about 3 lb), and escitalopram is not singled out in meta-analyses as high risk for weight gain; however, a large 2024 observational analysis found escitalopram had slightly higher odds of ≥ 5% weight gain than sertraline, so I should not overstate weight neutrality here, even though the absolute average gain remains small [^9a1d3848] [^eacd3420].

> I need to check citalopram. Comparative long-term data in OCD suggest citalopram is associated with moderate mean weight gain over 2.5 years, indicating it is not weight-neutral, though the magnitude varies and is generally less than paroxetine; thus, citalopram sits in a middle-risk category rather than a weight-neutral one [^a55c7fb9].

> Hold on, I should verify paroxetine and fluvoxamine. Multiple sources consistently identify paroxetine as the SSRI with the highest risk of weight gain, and fluvoxamine also shows higher likelihood of weight-gain searches in large-scale observational data; accordingly, these should be avoided when weight neutrality is paramount [^21cbea1c] [^3b6e166b].

> But wait, what if the clinical context is pediatric or adolescent anxiety. I should confirm that pediatric guidelines emphasize routine weight and growth monitoring with SSRIs, and that fluoxetine and sertraline remain common first-line choices with attention to weight trajectories during treatment, reinforcing that "no effect" is unrealistic and that proactive monitoring is essential [^b0b828ea] [^280cf22a].

> Let me synthesize a practical, risk-stratified answer. No SSRI has truly "no effect" on weight, but fluoxetine and sertraline are the most defensible options when minimizing weight gain is a priority, with fluoxetine often showing early weight loss or neutrality and sertraline demonstrating low average long-term weight gain; escitalopram is generally low risk but may have a slightly higher propensity for ≥ 5% gain than sertraline, while citalopram is intermediate and paroxetine and fluvoxamine carry higher weight-gain risk and should generally be avoided when weight neutrality is critical [^21cbea1c] [^eacd3420] [^a55c7fb9] [^3b6e166b].

> I should confirm monitoring and mitigation steps. Baseline weight and BMI should be recorded, with periodic reassessment during treatment; if weight gain emerges, consider dose reduction, switching to a lower-risk SSRI such as fluoxetine or sertraline, or adding nonpharmacologic weight-management strategies, recognizing that shared decision-making about expected weight effects improves adherence and outcomes [^21cbea1c] [^c5121ae8].

> Final check and bottom line: there is no SSRI with absolutely no weight effect, but fluoxetine and sertraline are the closest to "weight-neutral" within the class for anxiety disorders, with escitalopram as a reasonable alternative when balanced against efficacy and tolerability; paroxetine and fluvoxamine are higher risk for weight gain and should be deprioritized when weight neutrality is a key clinical goal [^21cbea1c] [^eacd3420] [^a55c7fb9] [^3b6e166b].

There is **no SSRI with zero risk of weight change** for anxiety disorders; all SSRIs can cause weight loss or gain depending on the patient and treatment duration [^37dcc518]. However, **fluoxetine and sertraline** are the most weight-neutral options, with fluoxetine often causing mild early weight loss and sertraline having minimal long-term weight change [^21cbea1c] [^eacd3420]. Escitalopram and citalopram are generally neutral but can cause modest weight gain in some patients [^eacd3420] [^a55c7fb9]. Paroxetine and fluvoxamine have the highest risk of weight gain and should be avoided if weight neutrality is a priority [^21cbea1c] [^3b6e166b]. Monitor weight regularly and individualize therapy based on patient risk factors and preferences [^b0b828ea].

## Weight effects of SSRIs in anxiety disorders

SSRIs have **variable effects on weight**, influenced by the specific medication, treatment duration, and individual patient factors [^37dcc518]. Weight changes can occur in both directions, with some patients experiencing weight loss, particularly during acute treatment, while others experience weight gain, especially with long-term therapy [^39cff53d].

---

## SSRIs with minimal weight effects

Among SSRIs, **fluoxetine and sertraline** are generally considered to have minimal weight effects, making them preferred choices for patients with anxiety disorders who are concerned about weight changes [^21cbea1c].

- **Fluoxetine**: Often associated with mild weight loss or weight neutrality, particularly during acute treatment phases. Long-term use may result in minimal weight gain, but overall, it is considered weight-neutral [^21cbea1c].

- **Sertraline**: Clinical studies indicate minimal long-term weight change, with some patients experiencing slight weight loss initially. Sertraline is generally well-tolerated regarding weight [^eacd3420].

---

## SSRIs associated with weight gain

Certain SSRIs have a **higher propensity for weight gain**, particularly with long-term use. These include:

- **Paroxetine**: Consistently associated with significant weight gain, especially with prolonged treatment. It is considered one of the SSRIs with the highest risk of weight gain [^21cbea1c].

- **Fluvoxamine**: Also associated with weight gain, although to a lesser extent than paroxetine [^3b6e166b].

- **Citalopram and escitalopram**: Generally considered weight-neutral, but some patients may experience modest weight gain with long-term use [^eacd3420].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Clinical guidelines emphasize the importance of **individualized treatment** and regular monitoring of weight and growth, particularly in pediatric and adolescent populations [^b0b828ea]. The American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP) recommends regular monitoring of height, weight, and BMI during SSRI treatment, with no specific laboratory tests required [^b0b828ea].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing weight changes

Several **patient-specific factors** can influence the likelihood and magnitude of weight changes with SSRIs:

- **Age**: Younger patients may be more susceptible to weight changes.

- **Gender**: Females may be more prone to weight gain with certain SSRIs [^fe5de537].

- **Baseline BMI**: Patients with lower baseline BMI may be at higher risk of weight gain [^fe5de537].

- **Genetic factors**: Genetic variations, such as CYP2D6 metabolizer status, may influence SSRI metabolism and susceptibility to weight gain [^notfound].

---

## Clinical implications and management strategies

Given the variability in weight effects among SSRIs, clinicians should:

- **Individualize treatment**: Select SSRIs with minimal weight effects, such as fluoxetine or sertraline, for patients with obesity or those at risk of weight gain [^21cbea1c].

- **Monitor weight regularly**: Track weight and BMI at each visit, especially during the initial months of treatment and after dose adjustments [^b0b828ea].

- **Educate patients**: Discuss potential weight effects and encourage healthy lifestyle habits, including diet and exercise [^c5121ae8].

- **Consider alternatives**: If significant weight gain occurs, consider switching to another SSRI or a different class of antidepressants, such as bupropion, which is associated with weight loss [^21cbea1c].

## Summary of SSRIs and weight effects

| **Ssri** | **Weight effect** | **Clinical recommendation** |
|-|-|-|
| Fluoxetine | Minimal; often weight-neutral or mild weight loss | Preferred for weight-conscious patients |
| Sertraline | Minimal; slight weight loss initially | Preferred for weight-conscious patients |
| Escitalopram | Generally weight-neutral; modest gain possible | Reasonable alternative |
| Citalopram | Generally weight-neutral; modest gain possible | Reasonable alternative |
| Paroxetine | Significant weight gain | Avoid if weight gain is a concern |
| Fluvoxamine | Moderate weight gain | Avoid if weight gain is a concern |

---

There is **no SSRI with zero risk of weight change** for anxiety disorders, but fluoxetine and sertraline are the most weight-neutral options, whereas paroxetine and fluvoxamine carry a higher risk of weight gain. Individualize therapy and monitor weight regularly to optimize outcomes [^21cbea1c].

### Clinical practice guideline for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with anxiety disorders [^b0b828ea]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2020). High credibility.

Children and adolescents with anxiety disorders — SSRI dosing and monitoring are described with a conservative medication trial that may increase doses within the therapeutic range at approximately 1- to 2-week intervals for shorter half-life SSRIs and at approximately 3- to 4-week intervals for longer half-life SSRIs until the benefit-to-harm ratio is optimized and remission is achieved, and because an initial adverse effect of SSRIs can be anxiety or agitation, it may be advisable to start with a subtherapeutic dose as a "test" dose. Systematic assessment of treatment response using standardized symptom rating scales can be considered as a supplement to the clinical interview, and for all SSRIs, medical monitoring can include height and weight; no specific laboratory tests are recommended. The optimal duration is unclear, but a generally accepted approach would be to continue an effective, tolerated dose for approximately 12 months after remission, monitoring for several months after discontinuation for re-emergence of symptoms, and discontinuation generally should occur during a relatively stress-free period.

### Escitalopram therapy for major depression and anxiety disorders [^8de5be83]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Randomized controlled clinical trials have demonstrated that escitalopram is efficacious in a range of mood and anxiety disorders, but the individual trials are insufficiently large to allow a full exploration of its tolerability.

Objective

To assess the tolerability and safety of escitalopram through analysis of all randomized controlled clinical trials in major depressive disorder and anxiety disorders.

Methods

Analyses of tolerability were based on data from all available randomized, double-blind, controlled studies completed by December 2006 in which escitalopram was compared with placebo or active compounds (citalopram, fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, venlafaxine). Adverse events (AEs) that occurred more frequently with escitalopram than with placebo were listed, and tolerability and safety were evaluated.

Results

Nausea was the only AE with an incidence greater than or equal to 10% and 5 percentage points greater than with placebo during short-term treatment. In general, AEs were mild to moderate in severity. AEs related to sexual dysfunction were similarly frequent with escitalopram and citalopram, but were higher with paroxetine. No suicide occurred among escitalopram-treated patients, and there were no significant differences between escitalopram and placebo in incidence of suicidal behavior, measured by self-harm and suicidal thoughts. The 8 week withdrawal rate due to AEs was higher with escitalopram than with placebo (7.3% vs 2.8%; p < 0.001) but lower than with paroxetine (6.6% vs 9.0%; p < 0.01) or venlafaxine (6.1% vs 13.2%; p < 0.01) (Fisher's Exact test, 2 tailed). Compared with paroxetine, escitalopram resulted in significantly fewer discontinuation symptoms (average increase in Discontinuation Emergent Signs and Symptoms Scale of 1.6 vs 3.9; p < 0.01). There were no clinically relevant changes in clinical laboratory values in patients treated with escitalopram. Mean weight change after 6 months of treatment with escitalopram (0.58 ± 2.63 kg) was similar to that with placebo (0.15 ± 2.33 kg). The incidence of cardiovascular events was similar to that with placebo. The risk of AEs was no higher in special patient populations, such as the elderly (≥ 65 y of age) or those with hepatic dysfunction.

Conclusions

Based on data from randomized controlled trials involving more than 4000 escitalopram-treated patients, escitalopram (10–20 mg/day) is safe and well tolerated in short- and long-term treatment.

### Is increased antidepressant exposure a contributory factor to the obesity pandemic? [^ea33421f]. Translational Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

SSRIs and SNRIs

Initially, when patients were treated acutely with SSRIs weight loss was observed. Currently, SSRIs are useful for the treatment of obese patients with binge eating disorder, given their anti-impulsive action. However, their clinical relevance for weight loss in these patients remains unclear. In the recently published Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guideline on the Pharmacological Management of Obesity, the use of SSRIs is not listed as a therapeutic tool. Despite the fact that SSRI use has been associated with weight loss when acutely treated, a number of studies have shown SSRIs to be associated with long-term risk of weight gain. However, the number of long-term studies over the period of 1 year is limited, and there is a need for studies specifically investigating the long-term effects of SSRIs on body weight.

Cascade et al. reported that 6% of patients using SSRIs gained weight. The Canadian National Population Health Survey (NPHS) is a longitudinal study that has found that SSRIs and the SNRI venlafaxine use are associated with significant weight gain. A long-term comparison study investigated the effects of different types of SSRI on weight gain in patients with panic disorder. It showed that paroxetine, fluoxetine, citalopram and fluvoxamine induced weight gain of, respectively, 8.2 ± 5.4, 5.2 ± 4.4, 6.9 ± 5.7 and 6.3 ± 4.2 kg in a 1-year period. Michelson et al. observed changes in body weight during a 1-year trial period of fluoxetine treatment. The initial 12-week period was associated with weight loss of 0.35 kg, and 50 weeks of treatment resulted in weight gain of 3 kg.

### Evidence-based somatic treatment of depression in adults [^87c05936]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

The efficacy of antidepressants has become a contentious topic over the last decade, and yet a review of the literature shows that they are consistently more effective than placebo. Although the average magnitude of this effect is unclear, many individual patients respond well to a course of antidepressants, and relapse when the medication is discontinued. Choosing the right antidepressant for a given patient remains more art than science, but the studies reviewed here provide some helpful guidance. Table 4 lists the second-generation antidepressants along with potential reasons for choosing one over the other (based on side effects, costs, or possible therapeutic advantages.) Based on these data, the following conclusions can be drawn:

- For an all-around first-line antidepressant, sertraline is hard to beat, given its combination of efficacy, tolerability, and low expense. Once escitalopram becomes generic, it will join sertraline in this category.
- Bupropion is often a first-line alternative to sertraline, because of its lack of sexual side effects; although it has less efficacy for anxiety disorders, it is helpful for other comorbidities, such as tobacco dependence and attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder.
- Both paroxetine and mirtazepine are often maligned because of side effects of sedation and weight gain; however, these side effects may be advantageous for those whose depressive symptoms include insomnia and excessive weight loss.
- Although not specifically reviewed in this article, certain antidepressants are liable to cause more drug–drug interactions than others; the most prominent of these are fluoxetine, paroxetine, and fluvoxamine.

### Remission of generalized anxiety disorder: a review of the paroxetine clinical trials database [^07770db3]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

Paroxetine is a potent selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor with antidepressant and anxiolytic activity that is effective in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), improving the core symptoms of anxiety, worry, and tension. The majority of patients with GAD have chronic symptomatology and significant comorbid mood and anxiety disorders that often require ongoing pharmacotherapy. This article reviews the efficacy and tolerability of paroxetine in the short- and long-term treatment of GAD including remission data.

Data Sources

Data from more than 1800 outpatients with DSM-IV-defined GAD were analyzed from 3 short-term (8-week) studies and a longer (6-month) relapse prevention study. These studies were all randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of paroxetine.

Data Synthesis

The results emphasize the benefit of paroxetine treatment in GAD, enabling a substantial proportion of patients to achieve clinical remission and preventing relapse. Long-term treatment with paroxetine also shows good tolerability with no evidence of weight gain.

Conclusion

Given the high comorbidity of psychiatric depression and anxiety, the long-term efficacy and tolerability of paroxetine are important considerations when selecting a first-line therapy for patients with GAD.

### Topiramate treatment for SSRI-induced weight gain in anxiety disorders [^e34ffa04]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Antidepressants, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), have been associated with significant weight gain, a problem that frequently leads to noncompliance and premature discontinuation of treatment. Topiramate is a novel anticonvulsant that has also been used as a mood stabilizer and augmentation agent in mood disorders. Topiramate has been observed to have an interesting side effect of weight loss in some individuals. In this study, topiramate was added to the treatment regimen of patients with a primary DSM-IV anxiety disorder who had experienced substantial SSRI-induced weight gain, in an attempt to induce weight loss.

Method

Topiramate was added to SSRI treatment in 15 anxiety disorder patients, starting at a dose of 50 mg/day and titrating up to a target daily dose of 100 mg/day, with a maximum dose of 250 mg/day. Subjects' weight was measured at baseline and after 5 and 10 weeks of treatment.

Results

Before topiramate treatment, SSRI-treated subjects in this sample had gained a mean of 13.0 ± 8.4 kg (28.6 ± 18.5 lb). After the addition of a mean dose of 135.0 ± 44.1 mg/day of topiramate for approximately 10 weeks, subjects lost a mean of 4.2 ± 6.0 kg (9.3 ± 13.3 lb).

Conclusion

Topiramate may have a role in managing SSRI-induced weight gain in anxiety disorder patients.

### Incidence of adverse events and comparative tolerability of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors for the treatment of anxiety, obsessive-compulsive, and stress disorders: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^c8f5e2fd]. Psychological Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) show similar efficacy as treatments for anxiety, obsessive-compulsive, and stress-related disorders. Hence, comparisons of adverse event rates across medications are an essential component of clinical decision-making. We aimed to compare patterns of adverse events associated with SSRIs and SNRIs in the treatment of children and adults diagnosed with these disorders through a network meta-analysis. We searched MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Embase, Cochrane, websites of regulatory agencies, and international registers from inception to 09 September 2022, for randomized controlled trials assessing the efficacy of SSRIs or SNRIs. We analyzed the proportion of participants experiencing at least one adverse event and incidence rates of 17 specific adverse events. We estimated incidence rates and odds ratios through network meta-analysis with random effects and three-level models. We analyzed 799 outcome measures from 80 studies (n = 21 338). Participants in medication groups presented higher rates of adverse events (80.22%, 95% CI 76.13–83.76) when compared to placebo groups (71.21%, 67.00–75.09). Nausea was the most common adverse event (25.71%, CI 23.96–27.54), while weight change was the least common (3.56%, 1.68–7.37). We found higher rates of adverse events of medications over placebo for most medications, except sertraline and fluoxetine. We found significant differences between medications for overall tolerability and for autonomic, gastrointestinal, and sleep-related symptoms. Adverse events are a common reason that patients discontinue SSRIs and SNRIs. Results presented here guide clinical decision-making when clinicians weigh one medication over another. This might improve treatment acceptability and compliance.

### A large-scale observational comparison of antidepressants and their effects [^3b6e166b]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) represent a diverse class of medications widely prescribed for depression and anxiety. Despite their common use, there is an absence of large-scale, real-world evidence capturing the heterogeneity in their effects on individuals. This study addresses this gap by utilizing naturalistic search data to explore the varied impact of six different SSRIs on user behavior.

Methods

The study sample included ∼508 thousand Bing users with searches for one of six SSRIs (citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline) from April-December 2022, comprising 510 million queries. Cox proportional hazard models were employed to examine 30 topics (e.g., shopping, tourism, health) and 195 health symptoms (e.g., anxiety, weight gain, impotence), using each SSRI as a reference. We assessed the relative hazard ratios between drugs and, where feasible, ranked the SSRIs based on their observed effects. We used Cox proportional hazard models in order to account for both the likelihood of users searching for a particular topic or symptom and the associated time to that search. The temporal aspect aided in distinguishing between potential symptoms of the disorder, short-term medication side effects, and later appearing side effects.

Results

Differences were found in search behaviors associated with each SSRI. E.g., fluvoxamine was associated with a significantly higher likelihood of searching weight gain compared to all other SSRIs (HRs 1.85–2.93). Searches following citalopram were associated with significantly higher rates of later impotence queries compared to all other SSRIs (HRs 5.11–7.76), except fluvoxamine. Fluvoxamine was associated with a significantly higher rate of health related searches than all other SSRIs (HRs 2.11–2.36).

Conclusions

Our study reveals new insights into the varying SSRI impacts, suggesting distinct symptom profiles. This novel use of large-scale, naturalistic search data contributes to pharmacovigilance efforts, enhancing our understanding of intra-class variation among SSRIs, potentially uncovering previously unidentified drug effects.

### Clinical practice guideline for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with anxiety disorders [^549ef078]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2020). High credibility.

Serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) — for all SNRIs, medical monitoring should include height, weight, pulse, and blood pressure, and no specific laboratory tests are recommended. As with SSRIs, a discontinuation syndrome has been reported following missed doses or acute discontinuation of SNRIs, and SNRIs also warrant a slow discontinuation taper.

### Agomelatine versus other antidepressive agents for major depression [^7f18e2e4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Major depressive disorder (MDD), or depression, is a syndrome characterised by a number of behavioural, cognitive and emotional features. It is most commonly associated with a sad or depressed mood, a reduced capacity to feel pleasure, feelings of hopelessness, loss of energy, altered sleep patterns, weight fluctuations, difficulty in concentrating and suicidal ideation. There is a need for more effective and better tolerated antidepressants to combat this condition. Agomelatine was recently added to the list of available antidepressant drugs; it is a novel antidepressant that works on melatonergic (MT1 and MT2), 5-HT 2B and 5-HT2C receptors. Because the mechanism of action is claimed to be novel, it may provide a useful, alternative pharmacological strategy to existing antidepressant drugs.

Objectives

The objective of this review was 1) to determine the efficacy of agomelatine in alleviating acute symptoms of major depressive disorder in comparison with other antidepressants, 2) to review the acceptability of agomelatine in comparison with other antidepressant drugs, and, 3) to investigate the adverse effects of agomelatine, including the general prevalence of side effects in adults.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Collaboration's Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Review Group's Specialised Register (CCDANCTR) to 31 July 2013. The CCDANCTR includes relevant randomised controlled trials from the following bibliographic databases: CENTRAL (the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) (all years), EMBASE (1974 onwards), MEDLINE (1950 onwards) and PsycINFO (1967 onwards). We checked reference lists of relevant studies together with reviews and regulatory agency reports. No restrictions on date, language or publication status were applied to the search. Servier Laboratories (developers of agomelatine) and other experts in the field were contacted for supplemental data.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials allocating adult participants with major depression to agomelatine versus any other antidepressive agent.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data and a double-entry procedure was employed. Information extracted included study characteristics, participant characteristics, intervention details and outcome measures in terms of efficacy, acceptability and tolerability.

Main Results

A total of 13 studies (4495 participants) were included in this review. Agomelatine was compared to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), namely paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline, escitalopram, and to the serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), venlafaxine. Participants were followed up for six to 12 weeks. Agomelatine did not show any advantage or disadvantage over the other antidepressants for our primary outcome, response to treatment (risk ratio (RR) 1.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.95 to 1.08, P value 0.75 compared to SSRIs, and RR 1.06; 95% CI 0.98 to 1.16, P value 0.16 compared to venlafaxine). Also, agomelatine showed no advantage or disadvantage over other antidepressants for remission (RR 0.83; 95% CI 0.68 to 1.01, P value 0.07 compared to SSRIs, and RR 1.08; 95% CI 0.94 to 1.24, P value 0.73 compared to venlafaxine). Overall, agomelatine appeared to be better tolerated than venlafaxine in terms of lower rates of drop outs (RR 0.40; 95% CI 0.24 to 0.67, P value 0.0005), and showed the same level of tolerability as SSRIs (RR 0.95; 95% CI 0.83 to 1.09, P value 0.44). Agomelatine induced a lower rate of dizziness than venlafaxine (RR 0.19, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.64, P value 0.007). With regard to the quality of the body of evidence, there was a moderate risk of bias for all outcomes, due to the number of included unpublished studies. There was some heterogeneity, particularly between published and unpublished studies. The included studies were conducted in inpatient and outpatient settings, thus limiting the generalisability of the results to primary care settings. With regard to precision, the efficacy outcomes were precise, but the tolerability outcomes were mostly imprecise. Publication bias was variable and depended on the outcome of the trial. Our review included unpublished studies, and we think that this reduced the impact of publication bias. The overall methodological quality of the studies was not very good. Almost all of the studies were sponsored by the pharmaceutical company that manufactures agomelatine (Servier), and some of these were unpublished. Attempts to contact the pharmaceutical company Servier for additional information on all unpublished studies were unsuccessful.

Authors' Conclusions

Agomelatine did not seem to provide a significant advantage in efficacy over other antidepressive agents for the acute-phase treatment of major depression. Agomelatine was better tolerated than paroxetine and venlafaxine in terms of overall side effects, and fewer participants treated with agomelatine dropped out of the trials due to side effects compared to sertraline and venlafaxine, but data were limited because the number of included studies was small. We found evidence that compared agomelatine with only a small number of other active antidepressive agents, and there were only a few trials for each comparison, which limits the generalisability of the results. Moreover, the overall methodological quality of the studies was low, and, therefore, no firm conclusions can be drawn concerning the efficacy and tolerability of agomelatine.

### Recommendations from the 2023 international evidence-based guideline for the assessment and management of polycystic ovary syndrome [^09fc8bd1]. European Journal of Endocrinology (2023). High credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) — antidepressant and anxiolytic treatment notes that psychological therapy could be considered first-line management, and antidepressant medications considered in adults where mental health disorders are clearly documented and persistent, or if suicidal symptoms are present, based on general population guidelines. Lifestyle intervention and other therapies (e.g. COCP, metformin, laser hair removal) that target PCOS features should be considered, given their potential to improve psychological symptoms. Where pharmacological treatment for anxiety and depression is offered in PCOS, healthcare professionals should apply caution to avoid inappropriate treatment with antidepressants or anxiolytics and to limit use of agents that exacerbate PCOS symptoms, including weight gain, and healthcare professionals should be aware that not managing anxiety and depression may impact adherence to PCOS treatment / management.

Table 3 is based on the pooled population and lists effect sizes for (i) HDRS-17-sum, (ii) some of the subscales previously proposed, and (iii) all individual HDRS-17 items. In line with the comparisons of mean effect sizes presented above, all subscales yielded higher effect sizes than the HDRS-17-sum; however, for all subscales and for all other individual items, the effect size was lower than it was for the depressed mood item. Exclusion of the seven trials (comprising 12 comparisons) that were not included in the FDA reports since they were completed after the submission of the FDA application yielded somewhat higher effect sizes for both HDRS-17-sum and depressed mood, but again the effect size for depressed mood was considerably higher than that for HDRS-17-sum (Table 3).

For three items, gastrointestinal complaints, loss of weight and sexual functioning, the effect sizes based on the pooled population were negative (though non-significantly for gastrointestinal complaints and sexual functioning). For all three, an increase in severity at end point as compared with baseline was significantly more common in SSRI-treated patients than in those given placebo, the odds ratios being 1.27 for gastrointestinal symptoms (P = 0.009), 1.24 for weight change (P = 0.005) and 1.21 for sexual symptoms (P = 0.03).

### Long-term side effects of SSRIs: sexual dysfunction and weight gain [^c0d3f09f]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are associated with a variety of side effects, many of which are resolved during the first couple of weeks of treatment. Side effects that emerge or persist after 1 month of treatment include sexual dysfunction and weight gain. Although these adverse events are serious, they can be managed successfully if recognized early.

### Fluoxetine for adults who are overweight or obese [^3337bad6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Fluoxetine is a serotonin reuptake inhibitor indicated for major depression. It is also thought to affect weight control: this seems to happen through appetite changes resulting in decreased food intake and normalisation of unusual eating behaviours. However, the benefit-risk ratio of this off-label medication is unclear.

Objectives

To assess the effects of fluoxetine for overweight or obese adults.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, the ICTRP Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov and World Health Organization (WHO) ICTRP Search Portal. The last date of the search was December 2018 for all databases, to which we applied no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the administration of fluoxetine versus placebo, other anti-obesity agents, non-pharmacological therapy or no treatment in overweight or obese adults without depression, mental illness or abnormal eating patterns.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened abstracts and titles for relevance. Screening for inclusion, data extraction and risk of bias assessment was performed by one author and checked by the second. We assessed trials for the overall certainty of the evidence using the GRADE instrument. For additional information we contacted trial authors by email. We performed random-effects meta-analyses and calculated the risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for dichotomous outcomes and the mean difference (MD) with 95% CI for continuous outcomes.

Main Results

We identified 1036 records, scrutinized 52 full-text articles and included 19 completed RCTs (one trial is awaiting assessment). A total of 2216 participants entered the trials, 1280 participants were randomly assigned to fluoxetine (60 mg/d, 40 mg/d, 20 mg/d and 10 mg/d) and 936 participants were randomly assigned to various comparison groups (placebo; the anti-obesity agents diethylpropion, fenproporex, mazindol, sibutramine, metformin, fenfluramine, dexfenfluramine, fluvoxamine, 5-hydroxy-tryptophan; no treatment; and omega-3 gel). Within the 19 RCTs there were 56 trial arms. Fifteen trials were parallel RCTs and four were cross-over RCTs. The participants in the included trials were followed up for periods between three weeks and one year. The certainty of the evidence was low or very low: the majority of trials had a high risk of bias in one or more of the risk of bias domains. For our main comparison group - fluoxetine versus placebo - and across all fluoxetine dosages and durations of treatment, the MD was -2.7 kg (95% CI -4 to -1.4; P < 0.001; 10 trials, 956 participants; low-certainty evidence). The 95% prediction interval ranged between -7.1 kg and 1.7 kg. The MD in body mass index (BMI) reduction across all fluoxetine dosages compared with placebo was -1.1 kg/m² (95% CI -3.7 to 1.4; 3 trials, 97 participants; very low certainty evidence). Only nine placebo-controlled trials reported adverse events. A total of 399 out of 627 participants (63.6%) receiving fluoxetine compared with 352 out of 626 participants (56.2%) receiving placebo experienced an adverse event. Random-effects meta-analysis showed an increase in the risk of having at least one adverse event of any type in the fluoxetine groups compared with placebo (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.42; P = 0.07; 9 trials, 1253 participants; low-certainty evidence). The 95% prediction interval ranged between 0.74 and 1.88. Following fluoxetine treatment the adverse events of dizziness, drowsiness, fatigue, insomnia and nausea were observed approximately twice as often compared to placebo. A total of 15 out of 197 participants (7.6%) receiving fluoxetine compared with 12 out of 196 participants (6.1%) receiving placebo experienced depression. The RR across all fluoxetine doses compared with placebo was 1.20 (95% CI 0.57 to 2.52; P = 0.62; 3 trials, 393 participants; very low certainty evidence). All-cause mortality, health-related quality of life and socioeconomic effects were not reported. The comparisons of fluoxetine with other anti-obesity agents (3 trials, 234 participants), omega-3 gel (1 trial, 48 participants) and no treatment (1 trial, 60 participants) showed inconclusive results (very low certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Low-certainty evidence suggests that off-label fluoxetine may decrease weight compared with placebo. However, low-certainty evidence suggests an increase in the risk for dizziness, drowsiness, fatigue, insomnia and nausea following fluoxetine treatment.

### Practice guideline for the treatment of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder [^41b00fe4]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Obsessive-compulsive disorder acute phase — choosing specific pharmacological treatment: Clomipramine, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, and sertraline, which are approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of OCD, are recommended pharmacological agents. Although meta-analyses and head-to-head trials suggest greater efficacy for clomipramine than for fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, and sertraline, the results of head-to-head trials comparing clomipramine and SSRIs directly do not support this impression. Because SSRIs have a less troublesome side-effect profile than clomipramine, an SSRI is preferred for a first medication trial. Although all SSRIs (including citalopram and escitalopram) appear to be equally effective, individual patients may respond well to one and not to another, and reasons for this patient-specific response are unknown; no demographic or clinical variables are sufficiently accurate predictors of treatment outcome to guide selection. In choosing among SSRIs, the psychiatrist should consider safety and acceptability of particular side effects, applicable FDA warnings, potential drug interactions, past treatment response, and co-occurring general medical conditions; for example, paroxetine, the SSRI most associated with weight gain and the most anticholinergic SSRI, would not be the first choice for patients with obesity, diabetes mellitus, constipation, or urinary hesitancy.

### Antidepressant side effects and their impact on treatment outcome in people with major depressive disorder: an iSPOT-D report [^f6b99ae9]. Translational Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) are first-line pharmacological treatments for people with major depressive disorder (MDD) and anxiety disorders. However, SSRIs and SNRIs are associated with a range of side effects, including loss of appetite, weight loss, drowsiness, dizziness, fatigue, headaches, increased suicidal thoughts, nausea/vomiting, sexual dysfunction, and increased risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. While specific antidepressant side effects are diverse, they also occur generally with a high frequency, intensity, and burden. Previous studies suggest that frequency, intensity, and burden of side effects are impacted by antidepressant treatment type, anxiety symptoms, and the presence of anxious depression (for a review, see Ionescu et al.).

Anxious depression is present in approximately half of the MDD population and is commonly defined either syndromally (i.e. co-occurring MDD and anxiety disorder diagnoses) or using 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale Depression (HRSD 17) criteria (i.e. MDD diagnosis and an HRSD 17 anxiety/somatisation factor score of ≥ 7). Some, but not all studies suggest that anxious depression increases the severity of side effects (for a review, see Ionescu et al.). For example, people with anxious depression were found to have a greater maximum frequency, intensity, and burden of side effects compared to people with non-anxious depression in the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) trial. A greater side effect severity has also been found at various study endpoints in people with anxious depression compared to people with MDD only. However, these associations are not found in all definitions of anxious depression, with Gaspersz et al. finding no differences in the frequency of side effects between people with syndromal and non-syndromal anxious depression.

### Paroxetine hydrochloride anhydrous [^d9942e72]. FDA (2015). Low credibility.

In placebo-controlled clinical trials involving more than 3,200 patients, the ranges for the reported incidence of sexual side effects in males and females with major depressive disorder, OCD, panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, and GAD are displayed in Table 6.

There are no adequate and well-controlled studies examining sexual dysfunction with paroxetine treatment.

Paroxetine treatment has been associated with several cases of priapism. In those cases with a known outcome, patients recovered without sequelae.

While it is difficult to know the precise risk of sexual dysfunction associated with the use of SSRIs, physicians should routinely inquire about such possible side effects.

Weight and Vital Sign Changes

Significant weight loss may be an undesirable result of treatment with paroxetine for some patients but, on average, patients in controlled trials had minimal (about 1 pound) weight loss versus smaller changes on placebo and active control. No significant changes in vital signs (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse and temperature) were observed in patients treated with paroxetine in controlled clinical trials.

ECG Changes

In an analysis of ECGs obtained in 682 patients treated with paroxetine and 415 patients treated with placebo in controlled clinical trials, no clinically significant changes were seen in the ECGs of either group.

### Association between CYP metabolizer phenotypes and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors induced weight gain: a retrospective cohort study [^fe5de537]. BMC Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Obesity is a chronic and complex multifactorial disease associated with multiple metabolic comorbidities, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, and psychiatric diagnoses such as major depressive and anxiety disorders. There is a bidirectional relation between depression and obesity; thus, patients with obesity have a 55% increased risk of being diagnosed with depression over time, and patients with depression have a 58% increased risk of developing obesity.

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the first-line treatment for depression. One side effect of their use is body weight gain during short- and long-term management. In fact, it is reported that patients prescribed an SSRI gain 4.2 kg more than non-users after a three-month treatment period, and that after 2.5 years of SSRI treatment, there is an increment of 2.5% of the initial body weight. The risk factors associated with weight gain while receiving antidepressant medications are lower BMI at baseline, age under 65, and female gender. However, the mechanisms of weight gain related to antidepressant use are not well known. Possible mechanisms include remission of major depression and increased neurotransmitters such as serotonin, which regulates feeding behaviors, energy expenditure, and decreased brown adipose tissue thermogenesis.

Overall effects of SSRIs over time

Lastly, we focused on the overall symptom-specific effects of SSRIs at all assessments (i.e. not adjusted for other symptom-specific effects; Fig. 2, panel b) and compared these to the direct effects as derived from the networks (Fig. 2, panel a). At all assessments, SSRIs had the strongest overall effects on depressed mood (e.g. Cohen's d = −0.40 at week 6) and psychic anxiety (e.g. Cohen's d = −0.31 at week 6), which is in line with the strong direct effects identified by the network estimations. In contrast, the overall effects of SSRIs on cognitive symptoms were substantial (i.e. Cohen's d ranging from −0.25 to −0.19 at week 6), whereas the direct effects were small. The detrimental overall effect of SSRIs on loss of weight was largely in line with its direct effect. No overall effect on genital problems was found, whereas the networks revealed a direct detrimental effect of active treatment that gradually became stronger over time.

Antidepressants and mood stabilizers — weight and lipid effects in youth: Valproic acid shows "Weight gain seen during first 3 months of treatment," with additional notes including "Increased hunger due to low glucose levels" and "No direct effect on lipids." Lithium lists "Risk of weight gain is high" and "No direct effect on lipids." Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) — "Fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline" — are the "Most commonly used medication for treatment of depression in adolescents," and are linked to a "Small increase (0.007) in BMI z-score over a 14 month period of treatment as compared to no medication," with "Weight gain greater in females than males" and "No direct effect on lipids." Serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) — "Mirtazapine and Trazodone" — note "Weight gain greater in females than males" and an "Unfavorable effect on triglycerides and LDL."

### Practice guideline for the treatment of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder [^e5c15b57]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Implementing pharmacotherapy for obsessive-compulsive disorder highlights practical dosing and response expectations: for most patients, "the starting dose is that recommended by the manufacturer," yet "for patients who are worried about side effects, the medication can be started at half the listed dose or less," and many SRIs "are available in liquid form or in pills that can be split." Lower initial doses and gradual titration "may also be needed in patients with co-occurring anxiety disorders," and in the elderly "lower starting doses of medication and a more gradual approach to dose increase are often advisable." "Most patients will not experience substantial improvement until 4–6 weeks" and some responders may show "little improvement for as many as 10–12 weeks." Trial data "suggest that higher SSRI doses produce a somewhat higher response rate and somewhat greater magnitude of symptom relief," and "some patients… may benefit from even higher doses than those shown in the last column of Table 3," in which case "the patient should be closely monitored for side effects, including the serotonin syndrome"; moreover, patients "who have not responded to a known effective dose after 10–12 weeks may respond at higher doses."

### One (effect) size does not fit at all: interpreting clinical significance and effect sizes in depression treatment trials [^ca371b20]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2020). Medium credibility.

One early attempt to improve measuring of depression severity was undertaken by Per Bech. Bech extracted a unidimensional six-item subscale from the 17 items included in the original HDRS. This subscale, developed well before introduction of modern antidepressants, has several decades later been shown to yield 20–30% larger drug-placebo separation than the full HDRS scale. Its constituent items, that is, depressed mood, feelings of guilt, work and interests, psychomotor retardation, psychic anxiety and general somatic symptoms – which measures fatigability and loss of energy – correspond well to symptoms that explain most variance in patient-assessed impairment of functioning. This suggests these are the symptoms that matter most to patients. Add suicidal ideation to this list and one has the collection of symptoms where serotonergic antidepressants most clearly, and rapidly, separate from both placebo and psychotherapy. By contrast, serotonergic antidepressants do not excel on HDRS items such as insomnia, agitation, somatic anxiety, gastrointestinal symptoms, sexual dysfunction and weight loss (Table 1); especially not in people with comparatively mild depression. Taken together, the mean HDRS change gives an incomplete and noisy picture. In fact, the effects of antidepressants are not small and non-specific, as suggested, rather they are sizeable and affect preferentially those symptoms that depressed persons appear to judge most relevant.

### Escitalopram oxalate (Lexapro) [^6ac405e9]. FDA (2014). Low credibility.

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Lexapro® is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) indicated for:

Acute and Maintenance Treatment of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) in adults and adolescents aged 12–17 years (1.1)
Acute Treatment of Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) in adults (1.2)

1.1 Major Depressive Disorder

Lexapro (escitalopram) is indicated for the acute and maintenance treatment of major depressive disorder in adults and in adolescents 12 to 17 years of age [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

A major depressive episode (DSM-IV) implies a prominent and relatively persistent (nearly every day for at least 2 weeks) depressed or dysphoric mood that usually interferes with daily functioning, and includes at least five of the following nine symptoms: depressed mood, loss of interest in usual activities, significant change in weight and/or appetite, insomnia or hypersomnia, psychomotor agitation or retardation, increased fatigue, feelings of guilt or worthlessness, slowed thinking or impaired concentration, a suicide attempt or suicidal ideation.

1.2 Generalized Anxiety Disorder

Lexapro is indicated for the acute treatment of Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) in adults [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

Generalized Anxiety Disorder (DSM-IV) is characterized by excessive anxiety and worry (apprehensive expectation) that is persistent for at least 6 months and which the person finds difficult to control. It must be associated with at least 3 of the following symptoms: restlessness or feeling keyed up or on edge, being easily fatigued, difficulty concentrating or mind going blank, irritability, muscle tension, and sleep disturbance.

### Metabolic, behavioral health, and disordered eating comorbidities associated with obesity in pediatric patients: an obesity medical association (OMA) clinical practice statement 2022 [^f94d125a]. Obesity Pillars (2022). High credibility.

Anxiety in children with overweight/obesity — epidemiology, screening, and treatment considerations are as follows: Obesity in children is strongly associated with depression and anxiety even after other risk factors are taken into account, with prevalence in the general population 20–25% of youth with the median age of onset 6 years; the frequency (odds ratio) of anxiety in children with obesity is 1.30, children with severe obesity have five times higher risk of anxiety, and anxiety with increased BMI is more common in females than in males. Because of increased prevalence, routine screening for anxiety is recommended in children and adolescents with overweight/obesity, using instruments such as Screen for Child Anxiety Related Disorders (SCARED) (41 items — widely used), Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) (7 items), and Spence Children's Anxiety Scale (SCAS) (35–45 items). A child with a positive screen should be referred to a mental health professional; possible treatments include psychotherapy, and if pharmacotherapy is added to the treatment regimen, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are first line therapeutic choices, noting that SSRI medications are frequently associated with medication induced weight gain and the choice of SSRI needs to balance effectiveness with a possible exacerbation of weight gain.

### Escitalopram [^cef9ca2a]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

8.4 Pediatric Use

Major Depressive Disorder

The safety and effectiveness of escitalopram for the treatment of major depressive disorder have been established in pediatric patients 12 years of age and older. Use of escitalopram for this indication is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies in adults with additional evidence from an 8-week, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled study that compared escitalopram 10 mg to 20 mg once daily to placebo in pediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age with major depressive disorder [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. The safety of escitalopram was similar to adult patients with MDD [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

The safety and effectiveness of escitalopram for the treatment of major depressive disorder have not been established in pediatric patients younger than 12 years of age. In a 24-week, open- label safety study in 118 pediatric patients aged 7 to 11 years who had major depressive disorder, the safety findings were consistent with the known safety and tolerability profile for escitalopram.

Generalized Anxiety Disorder

The safety and effectiveness of escitalopram for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder have not been established in pediatric patients younger than 7 years of age.

Antidepressants increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in pediatric patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Decreased appetite and weight loss have been observed in association with the use of SSRIs. Consequently, regular monitoring of weight and growth should be performed in children and adolescents treated with an SSRI such as escitalopram.

### Fluoxetine for anorexia nervosa after weight restoration: moderation of effect by depression [^6e61159a]. Psychological Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Although symptoms of anxiety and depression are common among individuals with anorexia nervosa (AN), the small number of randomized placebo-controlled trials (RCTs) of antidepressants have provided little evidence of therapeutic benefit (Fornaro et al.). Among these negative trials was an RCT from our group comparing the benefit of fluoxetine versus placebo in preventing relapse among women with AN in the 12 months following full weight restoration (Walsh et al.). There was no significant difference between fluoxetine and placebo in time to relapse, the primary outcome measure. The only two significant differences were in secondary analyses of change in anxiety and in obsessionality over time favoring fluoxetine (uncorrected for multiple comparisons). No significant differences were found in similar analyses of nine other features, including depression, raising concerns about the validity of the finding regarding anxiety.

In light of the well-established efficacy of SSRIs in the treatment of depression and the surprising lack of efficacy of fluoxetine in the original study, we conducted a new analysis to examine whether the effect of fluoxetine versus placebo was moderated by depression. Specifically, we assessed whether fluoxetine was of greater benefit to the more depressed patients.

### Screening for eating disorders in adolescents and adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^614740fe]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF — scope of review, potential harms, and current practice: The USPSTF commissioned a systematic review to evaluate the benefits and harms of screening for eating disorders in adolescents and adults with a normal or high BMI, and evidence limited to populations who are underweight or have other physical signs or symptoms of eating disorders was not considered; the USPSTF has not previously made a recommendation on this topic. Potential harms of screening questionnaires include false-positive screening results leading to unnecessary referrals (and associated time and financial costs), treatment, labeling, anxiety, and stigma. Pharmacological interventions may result in adverse events such as dry mouth, headache, and insomnia (lisdexamfetamine); paresthesias and taste perversion (topiramate); or insomnia, nausea, and sexual disorder (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs]). Psychological interventions are likely to have minimal harms. Assessing weight, height, and BMI is standard care in primary care settings, and changes in growth or weight may result in the detection of some eating disorders, and no recent estimates of screening rates have been found in the literature.

### Efficacy and safety of SSRIs, SNRIs, and placebo in children and adolescents… [^fdcc101e]. JAMA Network (2017). Excellent credibility.

Because there was only 1 study, posttraumatic stress disorder was not included in subgroup analyses. Responses to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors were significantly larger in depressive disorders and anxiety disorders compared with obsessive-compulsive disorder. The placebo response was significantly larger in DDs compared with ADs and OCD and significantly larger in ADs compared with OCD. SNRI indicates serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. Thirty-six trials were eligible, including 6778 participants; 17 studies for DD, 10 for AD, 8 for OCD, and 1 for PTSD. Analysis showed that SSRIs and SNRIs were significantly more beneficial compared with placebo, yielding a small effect size.

Compared with participants receiving placebo, patients receiving an antidepressant reported significantly more treatment-emergent adverse events. With regard to adverse events, our finding that patients receiving any antidepressant reported more TEAEs, SAEs, and study discontinuation compared with those receiving placebo is in line with other meta-analyses reporting increased suicidality, 81 suicidal ideation, and suicide attempts 14 in children and adolescents receiving SSRIs and SNRIs compared with placebo.

### Second-generation antipsychotics for obsessive compulsive disorder [^b9f8813c]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is a psychiatric disorder which has been shown to affect 2 to 3.5% of people during their lifetimes. Inadequate response occurs in 40% to 60% of people that are prescribed first line pharmaceutical treatments (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)). To date not much is known about the efficacy and adverse effects of second-generation antipsychotic drugs (SGAs) in people suffering from OCD.

Objectives

To evaluate the effects of SGAs (monotherapy or add on) compared with placebo or other forms of pharmaceutical treatment for people with OCD.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group's controlled trial registers (CCDANCTR-Studies and CCDANCTR-References) were searched up to 21 July 2010. The author team ran complementary searches on ClinicalTrials.gov and contacted key authors and drug companies.

Selection Criteria

We included double-blind randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing oral SGAs (monotherapy or add on) in adults with other forms of pharmaceutical treatment or placebo in people with primary OCD.

Data Collection and Analysis

We extracted data independently. For dichotomous data we calculated the odds ratio (OR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) on an intention-to-treat basis based on a random-effects model. For continuous data, we calculated mean differences (MD), again based on a random-effects model.

Main Results

We included 11 RCTs with 396 participants on three SGAs. All trials investigated the effects of adding these SGAs to antidepressants (usually SSRIs). The duration of all trials was less than six months. Only 13% of the participants left the trials early. Most trials were limited in terms of quality aspects. Two trials examined olanzapine and found no difference in the primary outcome (response to treatment) and most other efficacy-related outcomes but it was associated with more weight gain than monotherapy with antidepressants. Quetiapine combined with antidepressants was also not any more efficacious than placebo combined with antidepressants in terms of the primary outcome, but there was a significant superiority in the mean Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) score at endpoint (MD -2.28, 95% CI -4.05 to -0.52). There were also some beneficial effects of quetiapine in terms of anxiety or depressive symptoms. Risperidone was more efficacious than placebo in terms of the primary outcome (number of participants without a significant response) (OR 0.17, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.66) and in the reduction of anxiety and depression (MD -7.60, 95% CI -12.37 to -2.83).

Authors' Conclusions

The available data of the effects of olanzapine in OCD are too limited to draw any conclusions. There is some evidence that adding quetiapine or risperidone to antidepressants increases efficacy, but this must be weighed against less tolerability and limited data.

1.1 Major Depressive Disorder

Escitalopram oral solution is indicated for the acute and maintenance treatment of major depressive disorder in adults and in adolescents 12 to 17 years of age [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

A major depressive episode (DSM-IV) implies a prominent and relatively persistent (nearly every day for at least 2 weeks) depressed or dysphoric mood that usually interferes with daily functioning, and includes at least five of the following nine symptoms: depressed mood, loss of interest in usual activities, significant change in weight and/or appetite, insomnia or hypersomnia, psychomotor agitation or retardation, increased fatigue, feelings of guilt or worthlessness, slowed thinking or impaired concentration, a suicide attempt or suicidal ideation.

1.2 Generalized Anxiety Disorder

Escitalopram oral solution is indicated for the acute treatment of Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) in adults [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

Generalized Anxiety Disorder (DSM-IV) is characterized by excessive anxiety and worry (apprehensive expectation) that is persistent for at least 6 months and which the person finds difficult to control. It must be associated with at least 3 of the following symptoms: restlessness or feeling keyed up or on edge, being easily fatigued, difficulty concentrating or mind going blank, irritability, muscle tension, and sleep disturbance.

Sensitivity analyses

To assess the accuracy of the most relevant edge weights in the estimated networks (Fig. 1), we performed a set of robustness checks. Supplemental Fig. S1 shows the bootstrapped sampling distribution (i.e. 5% and 95% quantiles) of the direct connections of SSRIs (relative to placebo) with depressed mood and psychic anxiety (i.e. the strongest beneficial effects of SSRIs) as well as with genital problems and loss of weight (i.e. the strongest detrimental effects of SSRIs) after 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6 weeks of treatment. The 5% and 95% quantiles did not include zero for depressed mood and -except for the network at week 1- psychic anxiety. The detrimental effect of SSRIs on genital problems gradually increased over time, with the 5% and 95% quantiles including zero at week 1 but not any other week. The direct aggravating effect of SSRIs on loss of weight was initially high and decreased over time, with the 5% and 95% quantiles including zero at week 3, 4 and 6.

To test the robustness of our network findings across trials, we estimated the networks while adjusting for trial-id and found no substantial differences in estimations; at week 6, for example, the beneficial effects of SSRIs on depressed mood (edge weight = −0.17) and psychic anxiety (edge weight = −0.12) and the detrimental effect on genital problems (edge weight = 0.11) were stable. Adjustment for age, which was significantly related to treatment condition (see the previous section on baseline characteristics), did also not substantially change the networks; at week 6, for example, the edge weights of SSRIs with depressed mood (edge weight = −0.17), psychic anxiety (edge weight = −0.11) and genital problems (edge weight = 0.11) remained the same.

### Escitalopram (Escitalopram oxalate) [^c0c5c5f4]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

8.4 Pediatric Use

Major Depressive Disorder

The safety and effectiveness of escitalopram for the treatment of major depressive disorder have been established in pediatric patients 12 years of age and older. Use of escitalopram for this indication is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies in adults with additional evidence from an 8-week, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled study that compared escitalopram 10 mg to 20 mg once daily to placebo in pediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age with major depressive disorder [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. The safety of escitalopram was similar to adult patients with MDD [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

The safety and effectiveness of escitalopram for the treatment of major depressive disorder have not been established in pediatric patients younger than 12 years of age. In a 24-week, open- label safety study in 118 pediatric patients aged 7 to 11 years who had major depressive disorder, the safety findings were consistent with the known safety and tolerability profile for escitalopram.

Generalized Anxiety Disorder

The safety and effectiveness of escitalopram for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder have not been established in pediatric patients younger than 7 years of age.

Antidepressants increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in pediatric patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Decreased appetite and weight loss have been observed in association with the use of SSRIs. Consequently, regular monitoring of weight and growth should be performed in children and adolescents treated with an SSRI such as escitalopram.

13, 14 Intrusive thoughts/re-experiencing phenomena also improved, although the degree of improvement was not statistically significant for each symptom scale. Whether patients with PTSD will benefit from long-term treatment with sertraline or a combination of the drug and behavior therapy is presently unknown. Sertraline has been associated with more cases of diarrhea than fluoxetine, but with fewer cases of anxiety and insomnia. At high doses, sertraline is an inhibitor of the CYP2D6 enzyme, but clinically significant drug interactions are unusual. Nevertheless, a two-week washout period is recommended before initiation of therapy with MAOIs.
12. 21, 22 Functional improvement was demonstrated in both studies.

The side effect profile of paroxetine is similar to that of the other SSRIs except that paroxetine tends to be more sedating and constipating, probably because of its anti-cholinergic activity. 7 The potential for weight gain, drug interactions, and sexual dysfunction tends to be slightly higher with paroxetine than with fluoxetine and sertraline. As with all SSRIs, it should not be taken in combination with MAOIs, and there should be a two-week washout period before starting MAOI therapy.
18. Recently, Paxil CR was brought to market in the United States in an attempt to decrease the gastrointestinal side effects of immediate-release paroxetine. 29 Anticholinergic side effects are significantly less severe than those encountered with other antidepressants. Sexual side effects are similar to side effects caused by SSRIs.

There were initial reports of significant elevations in diastolic blood pressure; however, subsequent analyses show that this phenomenon is significant only above a dosage of 300 mg daily. 36 The reported rate is one per 250, 000 to 300, 000 patient-years. Physicians should counsel patients who are taking nefazodone to be alert for signs and symptoms of liver failure, including jaundice, anorexia, gastrointestinal problems, and malaise. Nefazodone therapy should be avoided in patients with active liver disease or elevated serum transaminase levels, and discontinued in patients whose alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase levels are three times the upper limit of normal or more. There is no recommendation, however, for periodic testing of liver function.

### Reasons for discontinuation or change of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in online drug reviews [^245d26da]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What reasons for changes in the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are reported on a popular health website?

Findings

This qualitative study of 667 online drug reviews found that the most common reason for discontinuing SSRI use or switching to another SSRI was adverse events experienced, and the most common reason for dose change was titration. Adverse events categorized under psychiatric disorders (mostly apathy, anxiety, insomnia, and loss of libido), investigation results (mostly weight gain), and reproductive system and breast disorders (mostly sexual dysfunction) appeared disproportionately more often in online drug reviews than in US and UK regulatory adverse event reporting data.

Meaning

These results suggest that reasons for changes in SSRI use can be identified in online drug reviews and that adverse events mentioned may reflect those more salient to patients for discontinuing their medication.

### Antidepressants for anorexia nervosa [^f56be969]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Anorexia Nervosa (AN) is an illness characterised by extreme concern about body weight and shape, severe self-imposed weight loss, and endocrine dysfunction. In spite of its high mortality, morbidity and chronicity, there are few intervention studies on the subject.

Objectives

The aim of this review was to evaluate the efficacy and acceptability of antidepressant drugs in the treatment of acute AN.

Search Strategy

The strategy comprised of database searches of the Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Controlled Trials Register, MEDLINE (1966 to April 28th, 2005), EMBASE (1980 to week 36, 2004), PsycINFO (1969 to August week 5, 2004), handsearching the International Journal of Eating Disorders and searching the reference lists of all papers selected. Personal letters were sent to researchers in the field requesting information on unpublished or in-progress trials.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials of antidepressant treatment for AN patients, as defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, fourth edition (DSM-IV) or similar international criteria, were selected.

Data Collection and Analysis

Quality ratings were made giving consideration to the strong relationship between allocation concealment and potential for bias in the results; studies meeting criteria A and B were included. Trials were excluded if non-completion rates were above 50%. The standardised mean difference and relative risk were used for continuous data and dichotomous data comparisons, respectively. Whenever possible, analyses were performed according to intention-to-treat principles. Heterogeneity was tested with the I-squared statistic. Weight change was the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes were severity of eating disorder, depression and anxiety symptoms, and global clinical state. Acceptability of treatment was evaluated by considering non-completion rates.

Main Results

Only seven studies were included. Major methodological limitations such as small trial size and large confidence intervals decreased the power of the studies to detect differences between treatments, and meta-analysis of data was not possible for the majority of outcomes. Four placebo-controlled trials did not find evidence that antidepressants improved weight gain, eating disorder or associated psychopathology. Isolated findings, favouring amineptine and nortriptyline, emerged from the antidepressant versus antidepressant comparisons, but cannot be conceived as evidence of efficacy of a specific drug or class of antidepressant in light of the findings from the placebo comparisons. Non-completion rates were similar between the compared groups.

Authors' Conclusions

A lack of quality information precludes us from drawing definite conclusions or recommendations on the use of antidepressants in acute AN. Future studies testing safer and more tolerable antidepressants in larger, well designed trials are needed to provide guidance for clinical practice.

### Empirically supported use of psychiatric medications in adolescents and adults with IBD [^b031a308]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The use of psychotropic medications, particularly antidepressants, is common in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in spite of a lack of their robust efficacy in this population. This review provides an overview of the use trends of different classes of antidepressant and anti-anxiety medication and their effects on mood, nervous system function, gastrointestinal physiology and immunity drawing from the literature available in the general population, other medical conditions, and when available, patients with IBD. It also covers the evidence base for the actions, efficacy, and potential complications of antidepressants organized by different classes.

Methods

We conducted a PubMed search of articles relating the different drug classes probed to the terms above in different populations of interest. All types of articles were accepted including case reports and series, open and randomized trials, reviews, and expert opinion. We also examined the reference lists of the publications found.

Results

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are the most commonly prescribed agents for anxiety and depression in patients with IBD, though their efficacy for these conditions in the general population are mild to moderate at best. SSRIs are generally well tolerated, though at higher doses, they, like most antidepressant classes, can be associated with activation, serotonergic syndrome, and increased suicidal ideation. TCAs have many more serious side effects but have some shown efficacy for functional GI symptoms. A newer class, the serotonin noradrenergic reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), can be effective for refractory depression, anxiety and chronic pain syndromes with a side effect profile similar to both SSRIs and more mild manifestations of TCAs. Mirtazapine has moderate efficacy for depression if sedation and weight gain side effects are tolerated and some small support for use in nausea and vomiting. Bupropion targets dopamine and noradrenaline reuptake and has moderate efficacy for depression, and some small support for use in fatigue and smoking cessation. Buspirone has an indication for generalized anxiety disorder though studies show only a minimal benefit. It has some growing evidence for use in functional dyspepsia. Most of these agents have physiological effects on the brain, immune system, and gastrointestinal tract (with the exception of bupropion) hence their therapeutic and side effects manifested in these systems.

Conclusion

Antidepressant medications are frequently prescribed for depression, anxiety disorders, and chronic pain syndromes, but overall support for their efficacy is modest at best. Psychological interventions have growing support for having much more robust effects without the side effects of antidepressants and should be considered first-line treatment or at least an adjunct to psychotropic medications for these conditions.

### Practice parameter for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with eating disorders [^74eca702]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2015). Medium credibility.

Recommendation 7 — medications in anorexia nervosa (AN): The use of medications, including complementary and alternative medications, should be reserved for comorbid conditions and refractory cases [CG]. In AN, medications for adults have been tried in case series and small pilot studies, but results have not been encouraging; selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) were initially thought to help prevent relapse, but larger-scale studies did not support this, and no systematic studies of SSRIs have been conducted with adolescents with AN. Feasibility and acceptability of medication is a major problem because of fear of weight gain. A recent pilot RCT in adolescents found few benefits to adding risperidone to standard treatment, another small trial over a 10-week period found no differential benefit with the addition of olanzapine, and a small randomized study of quetiapine found some evidence of improvement but no statistically significant differences between groups. Preliminary data for adolescents also suggest atypical antipsychotics have been useful in case series and small RCTs in adults because of effects on weight, anxiety, and obsessive thinking.

### Common pitfalls, and how to avoid them, in child and adolescent psychopharmacology: part II [^9c5ab958]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2024). Medium credibility.

Eating disorders

Prescribing unnecessarily

Comorbidity is the norm alongside eating disorder diagnoses. Evidence suggests comorbidity rates, principally depression, anxiety and OCD, for adolescent anorexia nervosa range from 27% to 58%, and for bulimia nervosa, principally depression, from 48% to 60%. The treatment of comorbidities is not always necessary since the treatment for eating disorders includes strategies that facilitate emotional communication and coping skills. Consequently, without the need for additional treatment, depression and anxiety often resolve following the treatment of the eating disorder. Evidence suggests that, in some adult cases, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) may be useful in relapse prevention where symptoms do not fully resolve, although this has not been demonstrated in adolescents. The converse is not true – treatment for anxiety or depression is unlikely to improve eating disorder symptoms.

Refusal and non-adherence

Antipsychotic medications, specifically olanzapine (D2, 5-HT2 receptor antagonist) and aripiprazole, are effective in a small number of trials, case series and case reports in adults and adolescents with anorexia nervosa. However, the reluctance of patients to take olanzapine and low adherence and acceptability rates negate much of the potential efficacy of these medications and may account for why large clinical trials have not been possible to conduct in adolescent samples (e.g. a recent multisite olanzapine feasibility study –, personal communication). One possible reason for this lack of adherence is the focus on weight gain as the primary mechanism of action and the primary objective of olanzapine prescription. This is neither helpful nor, arguably, correct, although no mechanistic studies have been conducted as yet. Issues with accepting and tolerating weight gain as a desired outcome are central to the psychopathology of anorexia nervosa. Effective prescribing therefore requires reassurance that weight gain will not escalate over and above that expected for the standard treatment approach (typically eating disorders focussed family therapy) and that the purpose of the medication is to moderate emotional arousal associated with the first phases of treatment to manageable levels, without inducing somnolence. This is based on the sedative, anxiolytic and mood-regulating effects of antipsychotics, which may enable them to reduce obsessive ideas and anxiety, improving mood stability.

Methods

Study design

This retrospective cohort study approved by the Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board (IRB 19–001,222) included participants from the Right Drug, Right Dose, Right Time (RIGHT) Study who underwent genetic sequencing of pharmacogenomic genes. The RIGHT study included 11,090 participants, of which 60% were female and 97% were White. For the analyses, we considered participants from the RIGHT Study who had been prescribed citalopram, paroxetine, sertraline, or fluoxetine between 2004–2018. From those, we only included patients with a stable weight in the 6 months before starting the SSRI (n = 1,780). Of these, we exclude those who were < 18 years old, patients who did not have at least 6 months of treatment, did not have weight assessed during follow-up, had a history of bariatric surgery, were pregnant, or had a history of anti-obesity therapy (n = 1,117). The final analytic sample included 663 participants (Fig. 1). This study followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) reporting guideline (Additional file 2: Table S1).

Data collection

Three physicians exhaustively reviewed the electronic medical record (EMR) to confirm inclusion and exclusion criteria. For the 663 participants included in the analysis, medication list, height, and body weight were extracted from the EMR, and comorbidities were extracted with ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes. Race was self-reported by study participants in the EMR, and race categories (American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Black or African American, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, and White) were defined based on the US Office of Management and Budget's Revisions to the Standards for the Classification of Federal Data on Race and Ethnicity. Body weight was extracted in kilograms at the time of prescription (± 2 weeks), three (± 2 weeks), and six (± 2 weeks) months of the initial prescription. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated with the formula weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared.

### Antidepressant medications and weight change: a narrative review [^4a27a125]. Obesity (2020). Medium credibility.

Antidepressant medications are the first-line treatment option for moderate to severe major depressive disorder. However, most antidepressants have numerous documented adverse events, including cardiometabolic effects and weight gain, which are major public health concerns. Antidepressant agents provide varying risk of associated weight gain, including significant within-class differences. Some agents, such as mirtazapine, show significant levels of weight gain, while others, such as bupropion, demonstrate weight-loss effects. Current findings suggest the role of histamine and serotonin off-target appetite-promoting pathways in adverse weight-gain effects. Therefore, controlling for undesired weight effects is an important consideration for the selection of antidepressants.

After adjusting the severity distribution to reflect the no-treatment scenario (see figure 3 for a visualisation of the distributions), the sequela-weighted disability weight was 0·188 (0·070–0·341), meaning that 26·3% (10·2–45·7) of the non-fatal anxiety disorder burden was averted among patients of the 1997 NSMHWB. The sequela-weighted disability weight if all patients had access to optimal treatment was 0·056 (0·013–0·140). Location-specific sequela-weighted disability weights and severity proportions extrapolated from their respective HAQI scores are presented by GBD super-region in table 2 and by country in the appendix (pp 15–26).

### Weight gain during long-term treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder: a prospective comparison between serotonin reuptake inhibitors [^a55c7fb9]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Background

The effect of extended anti-depressant treatment on weight has been poorly investigated. Also unknown is whether different compounds have differential effects. The aim of the present study was to assess changes in weight in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) patients treated for 2.5 years with clomipramine or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.

Method

138 DSM-IV OCD patients who responded to 6-month acute treatment at the Mood and Anxiety Disorders Unit, Department of Neuroscience, University of Turin, Italy, were followed-up for 2 years while receiving open-label clomipramine, citalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, or sertraline. Patients were consecutively recruited and followed from May 1998 to March 2003. The mean percentage change in weight was compared for each group, as was the proportion of patients who had a ≥ 7% weight increase from baseline.

Results

At the end of the 2.5-year study period, patients had gained a mean of 2.5% of their body weight with respect to baseline (1.58 kg); 14.5% of the total sample experienced a significant (≥ 7%) weight increase. Within each but the fluoxetine treatment group, paired t tests showed a significant increase in weight from baseline to final visit. Analysis of variance showed a significant difference between treatment groups (p = .009), with clomipramine being associated with the highest weight increase and fluoxetine and sertraline with the lowest. A higher proportion of clomipramine-treated patients (34.8%) gained ≥ 7% in weight as compared with sertraline and fluoxetine, which accounted for the lowest percentage of patients with a significant weight gain (4.5% and 8.7%, respectively), although this difference was not statistically significant.

Conclusion

Risk of weight gain during extended serotonin reuptake inhibitor treatment for OCD differs depending on which compound is used. The differences among antiobsessive drugs may affect compliance with medication and health risks.

4 FREQUENT NEED FOR COMPLEX COMBINATION THERAPY

4.1 A new look at lithium

Guidance about how this is done is generally not available based on an inadequate treatment literature or spelled out in traditional guidelines, so we present here some preliminary suggestions as to how this might be pursued. Berk et al 2017reported that a year of randomized treatment with lithium of first episode manic patients was superior to that of quetiapine on virtually every measure assessed, including: mania, depression, functioning, cognition, and changes on brain imaging. Particularly if the patient has other characteristics predictive of lithium responsiveness, such as: a positive family history of bipolar disorder (and especially a family history of responsivity to lithium); euphoric mania; discrete episodes with well intervals; lack of anxiety and substance abuse comorbidity; and a sequence of mania‐depression‐well interval as opposed to DMI, one should strongly consider putting the patient on lithium or keeping it in the mix if it has already been used, but found not sufficiently effective. For the very large group without these characteristics such as those with an anxiety or substance abuse comorbidity, a mood stabilizing anticonvulsant such as valproate, lamotrigine, or carbamazepine or an atypical antipsychotic could be used in augmentation.

In the face of psychosis, residual manic or mixed symptoms, a well‐tolerated atypical antipsychotic in addition to lithium and an anticonvulsant might also be necessary. However, in people with psychotic symptoms, lithium has clear antipsychotic efficacy, suggesting the primacy of mood over psychosis in people with bipolar disorder. If the patient had had multiple depressive episodes prior to the first mania, lamotrigine or an atypical antipsychotic with efficacy in depression, such as quetiapine, lurasidone, or cariprazine might be preferred. It is noteworthy that the olanzapine‐fluoxetine combination (OFC) is not on our or many guideline's first‐line list as it can be associated with considerable weight gain and metabolic difficulties. There is evidence that weight gain is associated with poorer course and clinical outcomes and more pronounced brain structural and chemical changes in bipolar disorder. Further, it is also unlikely that OFC is a uniquely synergistic combination over and above that of other SSRI's or atypical antipsychotics, absence of data notwithstanding.

### Major depressive disorder, antidepressant use, and subsequent 2-year weight change patterns in the Netherlands study of depression and anxiety [^9300a575]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Although depression and obesity are bidirectionally associated, little is known about weight changes following major depressive disorder (MDD). This study compared 2-year weight changes between patients with current MDD (cMDD), patients with remitted MDD (rMDD), and healthy controls. Additionally, we examined the relationship between antidepressant medication use and 2-year weight change.

Method

Data from 2,542 adults aged 18–65 y were sourced from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety. Data were collected at baseline and after 2, 4, and 6 years (September 2004-April 2013). Depression status (DSM-IV criteria for MDD) was established with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Subsequent 2-year weight changes were categorized as weight loss (> 5% loss), weight stable (within 5% weight loss or gain), and weight gain (> 5% gain). The association of depression status with subsequent weight change, with weight stable as reference category, was studied by combining all repeated measurements in a mixed multinomial logistical regression model.

Results

cMDD, but not rMDD, was significantly associated with both weight gain and weight loss over a 2-year period after adjustment for covariates (odds ratio [OR] = 1.67; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.37–2.03; P < .001; and OR = 1.27; 95% CI 1.01–1.61; P = 0.045, respectively). Antidepressant use was associated with weight gain (SSRIs: OR = 1.26; 95% CI, 1.05–1.52; other antidepressants: OR = 1.36; 95% CI, 1.00–1.84; P < .05 for both), but not after considering depression status. Compared to cMDD patients who lost weight, those who gained weight had lower initial weight, were younger, had more comorbid anxiety disorders, and reported poorer quality of mood and reduced appetite as depressive symptoms.

Conclusions

Compared to controls, cMDD participants have greater odds of either gaining or losing weight over a 2-year period, regardless of antidepressant use.

### Pharmacological management of obesity: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^21cbea1c]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Medium credibility.

Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline — antidepressant selection and weight effects recommends a shared decision-making process that provides patients with quantitative estimates of the expected weight effect when antidepressant therapy is indicated (1|⊕⊕⊕○), noting that the expected length of treatment should also be considered. Evidence indicates heterogeneous weight effects: selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as fluoxetine and sertraline have been associated with weight loss during acute treatment (4–12 wk) and weight neutrality in the maintenance (> 4 mo) phase, with no significant effect observed for citalopram or escitalopram; paroxetine has the greatest long-term increase in body weight among SSRIs, amitriptyline is the most potent tricyclic inducer of weight gain, and mirtazapine is associated with long-term weight gain; among serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, venlafaxine and duloxetine have been reported to slightly increase body weight; bupropion is the only antidepressant that consistently causes weight loss and significantly decreased body weight in clinical trials; the commissioned systematic review found weight gain with amitriptyline (1.8 kg) and weight loss with bupropion (−1.3 kg) and fluoxetine (−1.3 kg).

### Evidence-based treatments in child and adolescent psychiatry: an inventory [^1844ced3]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To provide a list of evidence-based psychopharmacology and psychotherapy treatments for child psychiatry.

Method

Published reviews and Medline searches were examined to generate a list of treatments supported by randomized controlled trials.

Results

For psychopharmacology, the best evidence to date supports the use of stimulant medications for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) for obsessive-compulsive disorder. There is also reasonable evidence addressing SSRIs for anxiety disorders and moderate to severe major depressive disorder, and risperidone for autism. The psychosocial interventions best supported by well-designed studies are cognitive-behavioral and behavioral interventions, especially for mood, anxiety, and behavioral disorders. Family-based and systems of care interventions also have been found effective.

Conclusions

Although the number of evidence-based treatments for child psychiatry is growing, much of clinical practice remains based on the adult literature and traditional models of care. Challenges toward adopting evidence-based practices are discussed.

### Treatment and management of mental health conditions during pregnancy and postpartum: ACOG clinical practice guideline no. 5 [^d1f00995]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). High credibility.

Anxiety disorders in the perinatal period — prevalence, risks, and treatment positioning are summarized. Anxiety disorders are strikingly common, with contemporary data identifying that one in five women meet the diagnostic criteria for one or more disorders, and they can cause significant functional impairment; individuals with anxiety are more likely to have suicidal ideation and attempts compared with those without anxiety. Anxiety disorders are often comorbid with perinatal depression, and prenatal anxiety disorders are strong harbingers of postpartum depression; during pregnancy they have been associated with preterm birth and low birth weight, and prenatal anxiety disorders have been associated with behavioral challenges in offspring. Although psychotherapy-based approaches differ across anxiety disorders, OCD, and PTSD, the pharmacologic approach is similar in that first-line treatment is an antidepressant.

### Do side effects of antidepressants impact efficacy estimates based on the hamilton depression rating scale? A pooled patient-level analysis [^119cd9f9]. Translational Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

One could argue that SEs impact the overall well-being of the patient and that a rating scale including them provides a more accurate reflection of the overall usefulness of a drug than a scale not capturing unwanted SEs. While this reasoning applies for any scale aiming to measure overall well-being, HDRS and other depression rating scales are supposed to specifically measure depressive severity. Not least for future drug development, it is important to be able to distinguish drugs that are highly effective against depression, but provoke SEs in some patients, from those that are highly tolerable but only modestly effective. In this context, it is unfortunate that pharmaceutical companies and regulatory authorities still favour rating instruments with demonstrable shortcomings in this respect.

This study has a number of limitations. First, the symptoms that may be captured by HDRS-17 item 11 (somatic anxiety) are many and diverse. While we used an inclusive definition for the somatic anxiety-related SE group, being more (or even less) restrictive with regard to which SEs to include may strengthen or weaken the association between this SE group and the various outcome parameters. Second, there may exist SEs of active treatment of sufficient intensity to influence HDRS-17 ratings, but not of sufficient impact as to merit an adverse event report (and/or vice versa). This should likely work to attenuate the observed associations between reported SEs and HDRS-17 ratings. Relatedly, since the HDRS-17 separates between loss of appetite (HDRS-17 item 12) and weight loss (HDRS-17 item 16), we originally intended to include weight loss as a separate SE category, but opted not to do so after noting that SEs coded as 'weight loss' had low prevalence at endpoint (1.2%). Given the well-known short-term weight decreasing properties of drugs inhibiting serotonin reuptake, the low prevalence of weight loss-related SEs may reflect underreporting. Third, the association between adverse events and treatment response may also have been attenuated by the fact that both response and side effects should be influenced in the same direction by factors for which we did not control, such as inter-individual differences in dose, compliance, and drug metabolism. Fourth, due to the exploratory nature of this study we opted for a simple analysis scheme in which 'mild', 'moderate' and 'severe' SEs, irrespective of type, were translated into 1, 2 and 3 severity points, respectively, and then added together and analysed as linear predictors. This transformation, however, is questionable since severity categories are unlikely to be linearly spaced and since SEs likely differ in their association with HDRS-17 ratings. Thus, while we do believe that the results are strong enough to suggest a positive relation between SEs and (some) HDRS-17-derived outcome parameters, we do not assume this association to be linear. Fifth, early treatment emergent SEs, as well as early worsening in symptoms associated with depression (e.g. irritability, anxiety and mania), have been shown to predict lower remission rates. For feasibility reasons we, however, restricted our analyses to efficacy and SE reports collected at the endpoint visit (or last post-baseline visit in the ITT population); assessing to what extent SEs that appear early in treatment but remit prior to endpoint visit affect response trajectories over time was thus beyond the scope of this project. Sixth, the impact of SE "double counting" likely varies between studies due to differences in rater training, retention rates and adverse event recording practices. Seventh, this is a secondary analysis of data collected during the clinical development of duloxetine. While potentially a strength that these studies were not aimed at assessing the extent to which SEs and efficacy ratings may co-vary, hence limiting expectancy effects, the results should be replicated in studies directly aimed at assessing these issues, as well as in studies of other classes of antidepressants and outcome measures.

### Long-term body weight outcomes of antidepressant-environment interactions [^39cff53d]. Molecular Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

Discussion

We show here that during the course of a stress paradigm (restraint), short-term exposure to antidepressants decreases the depressive and anxiety behavioral correlates of stress. However, that short exposure to antidepressants is associated with significant body size and weight gain 122 days after discontinuation of antidepressant treatment in the context of a high-fat diet. We also show that a high-fat diet leads to correction of stress-induced weight loss in the absence of antidepressant treatment. These data suggest that exposure to antidepressants is a long-term risk factor for weight gain and obesity, even after antidepressant treatment is discontinued for a long time.

The relationship of antidepressant treatment and weight gain needs to be carefully examined. Clinically, weight gain is a common occurrence during both acute and long-term treatment with antidepressants, and it is a major problem for two reasons: (1) depressed patients are already at increased risk of cardiovascular disease, and weight gain could worsen that risk; and (2) weight gain is a cause of decreased antidepressant treatment compliance, resulting in treatment dropout. In adults, pooled analyses showed that SSRI treatment induces short-term weight loss, but long-term weight gain. There is still controversy of whether weight gain is mechanistically related to clinical improvement or if it is merely an undesirable side effect of antidepressant medication. Weight data have been derived primarily from re-analysis of drug trials or cross-sectional observation data. Moreover, it appears that specific types of antidepressants, such as tricyclic antidepressants and mirtazapine, are more likely to induce weight gain.

10. 1001/jama.
2024. 13390 Weight gain is a common adverse effect of antidepressants and might contribute to some patients stopping the medications. Now, a new observational study focused on the effects of 8 first-line antidepressants found that some types were associated with a greater chance of weight gain in patients than others. People who began taking the antidepressants escitalopram, paroxetine, and duloxetine tended to gain slightly more weight — up to about 0. 4 kg — after 6 months of using the medications compared with those who used sertraline, the researchers reported in Annals of Internal Medicine. They were also at a 10% to 15% higher risk of gaining at least 5% of their baseline weight, according to data involving more than 183 100 participants.

Sertraline was the most commonly prescribed antidepressant in the database the researchers used and was linked with an average increase of more than 1. 5 kg after 2 years. Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below.

### Mental health issues and psychological factors in athletes: detection, management, effect on performance, and prevention: American Medical Society for Sports Medicine position statement [^225c7fbc]. Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Depression in athletes — management and treatment considerations — emphasizes early recognition and team-based care, stating that health care providers should recognize that a concern about "performance," whether reported by an athlete or a coach, might be a symptom of depression or anxiety, and that unrecognized or undertreated depression can delay return to play. For the athlete with depression, there should be a multidisciplinary team approach; the team may include an MH care provider, a team physician, an AT, and family and coaching staff. When considering medication, prescribers should be aware of medications that may have a potential negative impact on performance and should also be familiar of side effects that may place an athlete at increased risk, including weight gain, sedation, and adverse cardiac effects; the health care team should also be aware of performance-enhancing effects, banned classes, and documentation needs, and a conservative approach to prescribing medication for depression is preferable. In an athlete without comorbid anxiety, bupropion can be considered; fluoxetine may be helpful if there is a comorbid ED, and there is some research that supports that fluoxetine does not have a negative impact on performance; other selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors may be reasonable options, and if there is an anxiety comorbidity clinicians could also consider SSRIs such as citalopram, sertraline, or fluoxetine. Nonpharmacological treatment can play a critical role; cognitive behavioral therapy, acceptance-based therapy, and mindfulness have all been used, none have been shown to be more effective than others in athletes, and the nonpharmacological approach should be tailored to the individual athlete and their clinical situation.

### Sertraline [^a3c8bb8c]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and efficacy of sertraline hydrochloride have been established in the treatment of OCD in pediatric patients aged 6 to 17 [See Adverse Reactions (6.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), Clinical Studies (14.2)]. Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients in patients with OCD below the age of 6 have not been established. Safety and effectiveness have not been established in pediatric patients for indications other than OCD. Two placebo-controlled trials were conducted in pediatric patients with MDD, but the data were not sufficient to support an indication for use in pediatric patients.

Monitoring Pediatric Patients Treated with Sertraline Hydrochloride

Monitor all patients being treated with antidepressants for clinical worsening, suicidal thoughts, and unusual changes in behavior, especially during the initial few months of treatment, or at times of dose increases or decreases [See Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Decreased appetite and weight loss have been observed with the use of SSRIs. Monitor weight and growth in pediatric patients treated with an SSRI such as sertraline hydrochloride.

Weight Loss in Studies in Pediatric Patients with MDD

In a pooled analysis of two 10-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, flexible dose (50 to 200 mg) outpatient trials for MDD (n = 373), there was a difference in weight change between sertraline hydrochloride and placebo of roughly 1 kg, for both children (ages 6 to 11) and adolescents (ages 12 to 17), in both age groups representing a slight weight loss for the sertraline hydrochloride group compared to a slight gain for the placebo group. For children, about 7% of the sertraline hydrochloride-treated patients had a weight loss greater than 7% of body weight compared to 0% of the placebo-treated patients; for adolescents, about 2% of sertraline hydrochloride-treated patients had a weight loss > 7% of body weight compared to about 1% of placebo-treated patients.

Methods

Search strategy and selection criteria

We conducted a computerised search of PubMed, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for articles published up to June 8, 2024. The detailed search strategy is provided in Supplemental Appendix 1.

The methods used in this meta-analysis adhered to the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) statement and checklist (PRISMA-2020). The study was a prespecified protocol registered in the international database of prospectively registered systematic reviews (PROSPERO: CRD42024547905). Studies were required to fulfil the following specifications: (a) placebo-controlled randomised controlled trials; (b) target population meeting diagnostic criteria for overweight/obesity; (c) receiving FDA- or EMA-approved weight-lowering pharmacotherapies; and (d) endpoints, including cardiometabolic or psychological indicators or adverse effects. The exclusion criteria are as follows: (a) participants were not overweight or obese; (b) the intervention did not involve weight-loss medications; (c) no placebo control was included; and (d) the outcomes did not assess weight-loss efficacy (e.g. changes in body weight, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference), cardiovascular and metabolic indicators (e.g. blood glucose, lipids, blood pressure), mental health-related indicators (e.g. depression, anxiety, sleep disorders), or safety indicators (e.g. severe adverse events or gastrointestinal side effects). The prespecified efficacy endpoints of this study included changes in body weight, BMI, waist circumference, body fat percentage, cardiovascular and metabolic indicators (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, fasting glucose, insulin, C-peptide, glycated hemoglobin, Homeostasis Model Assessment-estimated Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR), and C-reactive protein), as well as mental health indicators such as anxiety, depression, and sleep disorders. The prespecified safety endpoints included the occurrence of any adverse events, serious adverse events, and system-specific adverse reactions, particularly those affecting the gastrointestinal and nervous systems. The literature screening and selection process was performed independently by three authors (LL, ZL, and WY) following a predefined set of inclusion and exclusion criteria. Any disagreements arising during the screening were resolved through discussion and consensus among the authors to ensure an unbiased selection of studies.

### Antidepressants versus placebo for generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) [^d6001486]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) is a mental health condition characterised by excessive anxiety and worry about everyday events. GAD is a common disorder and generally affects women twice as often as men. Treatments include various psychological and pharmacological therapies. Among the pharmacological therapies, antidepressants, in particular, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), are commonly used for the treatment of GAD and many studies have shown their benefit over placebo. Only one systematic review and meta-analysis comparing all antidepressants to placebo has been done in the past. Since then, new data on existing antidepressants have emerged and new antidepressants have been introduced. An updated and more comprehensive review is needed to provide a stronger understanding of the efficacy, acceptability, tolerability, and impact on the quality of life of the various types of antidepressants compared to placebo.

Objectives

To assess the effects of antidepressants in GAD in adults, specifically: to determine the efficacy of antidepressants in alleviating symptoms of GAD compared to placebo and to review the acceptability of antidepressants in GAD in terms of adverse effects, including the general prevalence of adverse effects compared to placebo.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Health Disorders (CCMD) register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and two trials registers in October 2022.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCT) or cluster-RCTs that randomly assigned participants to receive either an antidepressant or placebo for the treatment of GAD. There were no restrictions on dose, frequency, intensity, or duration of treatment. The studies included adults of either sex with a primary diagnosis of GAD and without any serious medical comorbidities. Psychiatric comorbidities were allowed as long as GAD was the primary diagnosis. We excluded studies investigating psychotherapies and those that included participants who had regular use of benzodiazepines. There were no restrictions on setting, country, or language.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently checked eligibility and extracted data following standard Cochrane methodological procedures. We assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane RoB 1 tool. A third review author resolved disagreements between the two primary review authors. We extracted study characteristics, participant characteristics, intervention details, settings, and outcome measures regarding efficacy, acceptability, tolerability, and quality of life. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence.

Main Results

We included 37 unique RCTs with 12,226 participants in the review. The studies included adults with moderate-severe GAD and without any serious medical comorbidities. Few studies included participants with secondary psychiatric comorbidities. The double-blind treatment duration ranged from four weeks to 28 weeks. Antidepressants have a benefit over placebo on rate of treatment response measured as a reduction of at least 50% on the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) (risk ratio (RR) 1.41, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.29 to 1.55; 20 studies, 7267 participants; high-certainty evidence). The magnitude of effect corresponds to a number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) of 7 (95% CI 5 to 9). Antidepressants have no difference in acceptability compared to placebo, measured as the number of participants who dropped out during the trial as a proportion of the total number of randomised participants (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.14; 33 studies, 11,294 participants; high-certainty evidence). Fewer participants dropped out due to a lack of efficacy in the antidepressant group compared to the placebo group (RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.50; 29 studies, 11,007 participants; high-certainty evidence) with an NNTB of 27 (95% CI 24 to 32), and more participants dropped out due to adverse effects in the antidepressant group compared to placebo (RR 2.18, 95% CI 1.81 to 2.61; 32 studies, 11,793 participants; high-certainty evidence) with a number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) of 17 (95% CI 13 to 112). We observed similar findings when classes of antidepressants were compared with placebo. The certainty of the evidence for the analyses comparing different classes of antidepressants to placebo was high.

Authors' Conclusions

This review added to the growing literature on antidepressants in the treatment of GAD. We have high confidence that antidepressants are more effective than placebo at improving treatment response and that antidepressants have similar acceptability to placebo. Fewer participants dropped out due to a lack of efficacy in the antidepressant group compared to the placebo group and more participants dropped out due to adverse effects in the antidepressant group compared to placebo. We are highly confident in this evidence. This review identified some important gaps in the literature on antidepressants for GAD and can be used as a tool to guide future research. Future studies may be more transparent with their methodology and outcome reporting. Future reviews may also include people with comorbidities, and explore other sources of heterogeneity.

8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and efficacy of sertraline hydrochloride have been established in the treatment of OCD in pediatric patients aged 6 to 17 [See Adverse Reactions (6.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), Clinical Studies (14.2)]. Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients in patients with OCD below the age of 6 have not been established. Safety and effectiveness have not been established in pediatric patients for indications other than OCD. Two placebo-controlled trials were conducted in pediatric patients with MDD, but the data were not sufficient to support an indication for use in pediatric patients.

Monitoring Pediatric Patients Treated with Sertraline Hydrochloride

Monitor all patients being treated with antidepressants for clinical worsening, suicidal thoughts, and unusual changes in behavior, especially during the initial few months of treatment, or at times of dose increases or decreases [See Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Decreased appetite and weight loss have been observed with the use of SSRIs. Monitor weight and growth in pediatric patients treated with an SSRI such as sertraline hydrochloride.

Weight Loss in Studies in Pediatric Patients with MDD

In a pooled analysis of two 10-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, flexible dose (50 to 200 mg) outpatient trials for MDD (n = 373), there was a difference in weight change between sertraline hydrochloride and placebo of roughly 1 kg, for both children (ages 6 to 11) and adolescents (ages 12 to 17), in both age groups representing a slight weight loss for the sertraline hydrochloride group compared to a slight gain for the placebo group. For children, about 7% of the sertraline hydrochloride-treated patients had a weight loss greater than 7% of body weight compared to 0% of the placebo-treated patients; for adolescents, about 2% of sertraline hydrochloride-treated patients had a weight loss > 7% of body weight compared to about 1% of placebo-treated patients.

### Safety and efficacy of escitalopram in the long-term treatment of generalized anxiety disorder [^9a1d3848]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

Introduction

Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a chronic disorder that requires long-term treatment. Escitalopram has previously been shown to be effective and well tolerated in the acute treatment of GAD.

Method

Three 8-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of nearly identical design were conducted of escitalopram in moderate-to-severe GAD (DSM-IV criteria). Patients completing these trials were given the option of entering a 24-week, open-label, flexible-dose trial of escitalopram (10–20 mg/day). Data were collected from September 20, 2000, to August 15, 2002.

Results

Two hundred ninety-nine (56.8%) of 526 patients completed 24 weeks of open-label treatment. The mean Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A) score at baseline of open-label treatment was 13.1. Long-term escitalopram treatment led to continuing improvement on all anxiety and quality-of-life (QOL) scores. Of those completing 24 weeks of treatment, 92.0% were responders (Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement scale score ≤ 2), and the mean HAM-A score in the completed analysis was 6.9; using the last observation carried forward (LOCF), 75.9% were responders, and the mean HAM-A score in the LOCF analysis was 9.2 at endpoint. Insufficient therapeutic response and adverse events led to withdrawal of 4.2% and 9.9% of patients, respectively. Mean increase in weight from baseline was 3.0 lb. No clinically notable changes in mean laboratory, vital sign, or electrocardiographic values were observed.

Conclusion

These results support the long-term tolerability and effectiveness of escitalopram in the treatment of GAD.

Introduction

Depression and anxiety disorders are highly prevalent. World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 4.4% of the global population suffers from depressive disorder and 3.6% from an anxiety disorder, making them some of the leading causes of global disability and socioeconomic burden. This issue was highlighted during the COVID-19 pandemic, as a recent study suggests that the psychological footprint of COVID‐19 will likely be more substantial than its medical footprint. The development of mood disorders creates a burden that will impede national social and economic recovery even after the pandemic ends.

Depression and anxiety are likely to co-occur and share many symptoms and genetic factors. Despite the availability of a wide range of drugs for treating depression and anxiety, most patients fail to achieve complete and sustained remission. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the current first-line treatment for depression and anxiety, but they have pronounced limitations. Notably, they have low success rates, and delayed onset, and are associated with various side effects including sexual dysfunction and weight changes. These adverse side effects lead to a high percentage of patients who discontinue treatment. Therefore, there is a great need for a novel antidepressant treatment that has minimal side effects.

### Treatment and management of mental health conditions during pregnancy and postpartum: ACOG clinical practice guideline no. 5 [^41637380]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). High credibility.

Perinatal anxiety disorders — first-line pharmacotherapy is specified as follows: ACOG recommends that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) be used as first-line psychopharmacotherapy for perinatal anxiety, with serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) as reasonable alternatives, and pharmacotherapy individualized based on prior response; if there is no pharmacotherapy history, sertraline or escitalopram are reasonable first-line medications. Most experts recommend initiation of SSRIs or SNRIs for anxiety at half of the lowest recommended dose range to avoid early side effects such as agitation or insomnia, and treatment of anxiety and anxiety-related conditions often requires up-titration to doses that are higher than those for depression; experts also recommend that individuals with anxiety and anxiety-related conditions be in remission longer than those with an indication of depression before considering tapering or discontinuing psychopharmacotherapy.

### Bias in trials of antidepressants for anxiety… [^92ef8975]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

FDA indicates US Food and Drug Administration. Forest plot of effect size values for PD shows separate results according to the US Food and Drug Administration and according to the scientific literature. Weights are from random-effects analysis. aNot published. Forest plot of effect size values for OCD shows separate results according to the US Food and Drug Administration and according to the scientific literature. Weights are from random-effects analysis. Antidepressants are widely prescribed for conditions other than depression. 11 However, research on reporting biases for these other indications is lacking. The FDA review showed that the primary results for each of the dosage groups were nonsignificant.

Finally, one article61 presenting the results of trial 95–003, which compared the effect of sertraline with that of placebo in patients with SAD, combined scores on 3 end points in response vs nonresponse categories. Effect sizes based on data from the FDA reviews were 0. 32 for GAD,
0. 28 for PD, 0. 27 for PTSD, and
0. 39 for both OCD and SAD. For all disorders, the pooled effect sizes of trials published in agreement with the FDA review results were larger than the pooled effect sizes of trials that were not published or were published in disagreement with the FDA conclusion. Effect sizes based on the literature were larger for all disorders compared with effect sizes based on the FDA reviews, with the smallest increases for GAD and SAD and larger increases for OCD, PTSD, and PD. In the main analyses we combined 5 disorders classified as anxiety disorders in the DSM-IV; however, in the DSM-5, OCD is now classified under obsessive-compulsive and related disorders, and PTSD is under trauma- and stressor-related disorders. Therefore, with the recent change in taxonomy, our grouping of these disorders could be viewed as a limitation, although the efficacy of the drugs was comparable across disorders.

### Clinical practice guideline for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with anxiety disorders [^8527f77d]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2020). High credibility.

Children and adolescents with anxiety disorders — serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) can be considered among treatments offered to patients 6 to 18 years old with social anxiety, generalized anxiety, separation anxiety, and panic disorders. Medications from the SNRI class currently marketed in the United States are venlafaxine, desvenlafaxine, duloxetine, and levomilnacipran; atomoxetine is not further addressed because the effectiveness of atomoxetine for the treatment of anxiety as the primary disorder has not been established. Duloxetine is the only SNRI to have an FDA indication for the treatment of any anxiety disorder (specifically, generalized anxiety disorder in children and adolescents 7–17 years old). For dosing, venlafaxine extended release, desvenlafaxine, and duloxetine have sufficiently long elimination half-lives to permit single daily dosing, whereas venlafaxine immediate release may require twice- or thrice-daily dosing. Adverse effects of SNRIs can include diaphoresis, dry mouth, abdominal discomfort, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dizziness, headache, tremor, insomnia, somnolence, decreased appetite, weight loss, sustained clinical hypertension, increased blood pressure, and increased pulse; uncommon but potentially serious adverse effects include suicidal thinking and behavior (through age 24 years), behavioral activation/agitation, hypomania, mania, sexual dysfunction, seizures, abnormal bleeding, and serotonin syndrome. Venlafaxine may be associated with greater suicide risk than the other SNRIs, both venlafaxine and desvenlafaxine have been associated with overdose fatalities, and venlafaxine also has been associated with discontinuation symptoms. Duloxetine has been associated with hepatic failure and cholestatic jaundice, and duloxetine should be discontinued and not restarted in patients who develop jaundice or other evidence of clinically significant liver dysfunction; severe skin reactions can occur and accordingly duloxetine should be discontinued and not restarted at the first appearance of blisters, peeling rash, mucosal erosions, or other signs of hypersensitivity. Concomitant administration of any of the SNRIs and any of the MAOIs is contraindicated because of increased risk of serotonin syndrome; duloxetine may interact with drugs metabolized by CYP1A2 and CYP2D6, and compared to SSRIs, venlafaxine may have the least effect on the CYP450 system. At present, there is no clear role for pharmacogenomic testing in medication choice.

### Dosing of antidepressants in relation to body weight in children and adolescents with overweight [^6e71da2f]. International Journal of Obesity (2025). Medium credibility.

Regarding fluoxetine, both the Summary of Product Characteristics and a review article highlight the impact of body weight on steady-state plasma concentrations and recommend lower doses of fluoxetine for children with lower body weight. Importantly, dosing considerations for children and adolescents with overweight or obesity are not addressed.

Our results show that pediatric patients with overweight and obesity are prescribed lower doses of fluoxetine and sertraline per kilogram of body weight. While SSRIs are typically titrated based on therapeutic response and adverse effects, they have clearly defined maximum doses to avoid overdose and toxicity, which may contribute to the lower per-kilogram doses observed in these patients. Interestingly, studies in adults suggest that individuals with higher BMI or weight may have a reduced response to antidepressants, including SSRI. This reduced response may be linked to lower blood concentrations of the drugs, but other factors associated with overweight — such as inflammatory dysregulation, altered blood-brain barrier permeability, leptin resistance, and comorbid medical conditions — could also contribute to treatment resistance in these patients. However, it remains unclear whether BMI or weight similarly affects treatment response to SSRIs in children and adolescents.

It is still uncertain whether patients with overweight or obesity would benefit from higher or lower doses of antidepressants, as studies have shown mixed results on how elevated body weight may affect SSRI blood concentrations and therapeutic outcomes in children and adolescents. Considering the potential risks of treatment failure or drug toxicity in this population, larger studies are needed to measure both drug concentrations and treatment outcomes related to dosing in children with and without overweight and obesity. These data will be crucial for optimizing and individualizing dosing strategies for children and adolescents with overweight and obesity.

### Placebo response in trials with patients with anxiety, obsessive-compulsive and stress disorders across the lifespan: a three-level meta-analysis [^d680f0b4]. BMJ Mental Health (2023). High credibility.

Study selection and analysis

This study is part of a three-level network meta-analysis designed to evaluate the efficacy of SSRIs, SNRIs and placebo in internalising symptoms of children and adults diagnosed with anxiety, obsessive-compulsive or stress-related disorders. This review is registered in PROSPERO (registration number CRD42017069090) and is reported as recommended by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (online supplemental S1 table A).

Search

For this meta-analysis, we included RCTs assessing the efficacy of SSRIs, SNRIs and placebo in subjects with a primary diagnosis of any anxiety disorder, OCD or stress-related disorder according to standard operationalised diagnostic criteria (Feighner criteria, any International Classification of Diseases (ICD) version, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-III (DSM-III), Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-III-Revised (DSM-III-R), Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV (DSM-IV), Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV-Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) and Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5 (DSM-5). Studies could compare any SSRI or SNRI with each other (ie, head-to-head studies), with the same medication using distinct doses (ie, different dose studies) or with a placebo group; nevertheless, all RCTs had to include a placebo arm. Trials with any kind of previous intervention (eg, medication after psychotherapy period) or selection based on treatment resistance were excluded. No restriction was used regarding comorbidities with any other mental disorder (eg, depression, bipolar disorder), participants' age and sex, blindness of participants and researchers, date of publication, and study language.

We searched MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Embase and Cochrane using keywords related to study design, interventions and assessed disorders, from inception to 23 April 2015 and updated on 9 September 2022 (search strings are depicted in online supplemental S1 text A). Electronic database searches were supplemented with manual searches for published and unpublished RCTs registered in ClinicalTrials.gov, ISRCTN registry, European Clinical Trials Database, Pan African Clinical Trials Registry, International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers & Associations, Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, Food and Drug Administration database and pharmaceutical companies' databases. The reference lists of the included RCTs and relevant reviews were inspected, and experts were asked to indicate additional trials.

### Review: bupropion and SSRI-induced side effects [^d2682600]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2008). Low credibility.

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are a first line treatment option for millions of patients, due to the positive balance between efficacy and tolerability. However, some side effects associated with their use, can impair quality of life and compliance with treatment. This paper reviews the prevalence of sexual dysfunction, weight gain and emotional detachment during SSRI treatment, the profile of bupropion for each of these events and the ability of bupropion to reverse them. Double-blind trials, open-label trials and anecdotical reports derived from Medline were included. First, there is robust evidence that SSRIs can induce sexual side effects and that bupropion causes less sexual dysfunction than SSRIs. There is limited, mainly open-label evidence that bupropion can reverse SSRI-induced sexual side effects. Second, there is good evidence that long-term treatment with some SSRIs can result in weight gain and that long-term treatment with bupropion can result in a small weight loss. There is only anecdotical evidence that bupropion can reverse SSRI-induced weight gain. Third, treatment with SSRIs has been associated with; emotional detachment', although controversy exists about this concept. No data are available on the profile of bupropion for; emotional detachment' or for the reversal of SSRI-induced; emotional detachment' by bupropion-addition.

### Second-generation antipsychotics for anxiety disorders [^b861b1f6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Anxiety disorders are common and disabling conditions, with a lifetime prevalence of 17% in the general population. Due to high rates of treatment resistance, there is interest in new pharmacological treatment options such as second-generation antipsychotics.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of second-generation antipsychotics as monotherapy or adjunctive treatment for people with anxiety disorders.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group's controlled trial registers (CCDANCTR-Studies and CCDANCTR-References) were searched up to 21 July 2010. The author team ran complementary searches on ClinicalTrials.gov.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised trials (RCTs) comparing second-generation antipsychotic drugs with placebo, benzodiazepines, pregabalin or antidepressants. Participants were people with generalised anxiety disorder, panic disorder and specific phobias including social phobia.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors extracted data independently. For dichotomous data we calculated odds ratios (OR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI). For continuous data we calculated mean differences (MD) based on a random-effects model.

Main Results

The review currently includes eleven RCTs with 4144 participants on three second-generation antipsychotics (olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone). Nine studies investigated the effects of second-generation antipsychotics in generalised anxiety disorder, only two studies investigated the effects in social phobia. There were no studies on panic disorder or any other primary anxiety disorder. Seven studies investigated the effects of quetiapine. Participants with generalised anxiety disorder responded significantly better to quetiapine than to placebo (4 RCTs, N = 2265, OR = 2.21, 95% CI 1.10 to 4.45). However, they were more likely to drop out due to adverse events, to gain weight, to suffer from sedation or to suffer from extrapyramidal side effects. When quetiapine was compared with antidepressants, there was no significant difference in efficacy-related outcomes, but more participants in the quetiapine groups dropped out due to adverse events, gained weight and feeling sedated. Only two very small studies with a total of 36 participants examined olanzapine and found no difference in response to treatment. Two trials compared adjunctive treatment with risperidone with placebo and found no difference in response to treatment.

Authors' Conclusions

We identified eligible trials on quetiapine, risperidone and olanzapine. The available data on olanzapine and risperidone are too limited to draw any conclusions. Monotherapy with quetiapine seems to be efficacious in reducing symptoms of generalised anxiety disorder and this effect may be similar to that of antidepressants. However, quetiapine's efficacy must be weighed against its lower tolerability.

### Antidepressants and body weight: a comprehensive review and meta-analysis [^37dcc518]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

Psychotropic drugs often induce weight gain, leading to discomfort and discontinuation of treatment and, more importantly, increasing the risk of obesity-related illnesses such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and coronary heart disease. There is evidence that antidepressant drugs may induce a variable amount of weight gain, but results are sparse and often contradictory.

Data Sources

We performed a literature search using the MEDLINE, ISI Web of Knowledge, and Cochrane research databases for all publications available to January 2009. We used the following keywords: antidepressant, psychotropic drugs, body weight, weight gain, obesity, overweight, adverse event, side effects, SSRIs, tricyclic antidepressants, and the name of each antidepressant active compound together with body weight or other keywords. Studies reporting body weight changes during treatment with different antidepressants were selected for eligibility. Finally, 116 studies were included in the analysis.

Data Extraction

Weight change mean and standard deviation and size of each group were recorded. Missing means and standard deviations were directly calculated by using information available in the article when possible. Non-placebo-controlled studies were compared to a virtual placebo sample, whose mean and standard deviation were derived by the weighted mean of means and standard deviations of all placebo samples. Methodological quality of studies, heterogeneity, publication bias, and effect of treatment duration were systematically controlled.

Data Synthesis

Quantitative results evidenced that amitriptyline, mirtazapine, and paroxetine were associated with a greater risk of weight gain. In contrast, some weight loss occurs with fluoxetine and bupropion, although the effect of fluoxetine appears to be limited to the acute phase of treatment. Other compounds have no transient or negligible effect on body weight in the short term. However, the effect of each antidepressant may vary greatly depending on an individual's characteristics and generally became more evident in the long term to a variable degree across compounds.

Conclusions

Despite the fact that some analyses were done on only a few studies due to the difficulty of finding reliable information in literature, to our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive meta-analysis to allow comparison of different antidepressants as regards their impact on body weight. Data presented may be helpful for a more accurate treatment selection in patients at risk of obesity or related medical illness.

### The complex clinical response to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in depression: a network perspective [^ff503b1a]. Translational Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

Direct effects

At almost all assessments, the strongest direct beneficial effects of SSRIs were found for the two affective symptoms, i.e. depressed mood (e.g. edge weight = −0.17 at week 6) and psychic anxiety (e.g. edge weight = −0.11 at week 6). The effect on depressed mood was already substantial at week 1 (i.e. edge weight = −0.09) and the effect on psychic anxiety at week 2 (edge weight = −0.09), and both became stronger in the following weeks. Other direct beneficial effects were much weaker at all assessment (i.e. edge weights ≥ −0.05 for all symptoms at all assessments).

Interestingly, we also found some detrimental effects of active treatment. The detrimental effect of SSRIs on genital problems gradually increased over time, with an edge weight of 0.02 at week 1 and of 0.11 at week 6. The direct aggravating effect of SSRIs on loss of weight was initially high (i.e. edge weight of 0.16 at week 1) and decreased over time (i.e. edge weight of 0.03 at week 6). Other direct detrimental effects were much weaker (i.e. edge weights ≤ 0.06 for all other symptoms at all assessments).

Indirect effects

Figure 1 also shows that symptoms were related in an intricate way, illustrating the complexity of the clinical response to SSRIs. As the strongest direct beneficial effects were consistently found for the two affective symptoms, we zoomed in on the connections of these symptoms with other symptoms (i.e. indirect effects). At all assessments, depressed mood was most strongly connected to psychic anxiety (e.g. edge weight = 0.20 at week 6) and all four cognitive symptoms (e.g. edge weights ranging from 0.20 to 0.31 at week 6). Psychic anxiety showed the strongest connections to depressed mood (e.g. edge weight = 0.20 at week 6), specific arousal/somatic symptoms (e.g. agitation and somatic anxiety; both edge weights = 0.19 at week 6), and cognitive symptoms (e.g. feelings of guilt and loss of interest in work/activities; edge weights = 0.12 and 0.10 at week 6, respectively).
