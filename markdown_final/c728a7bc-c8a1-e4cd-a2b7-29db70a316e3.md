## Question

Common cause of elevated fasting glucose normal a1c

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the common causes of elevated fasting glucose with a normal A1C. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology that separates fasting hyperglycemia from chronic glycemia reflected by A1C. Then, I should verify the most common clinical phenotype that produces isolated impaired fasting glucose. Next, I will consider less common but important contributors such as medications, assay interference, and early dysglycemia. After that, I should review population-level data to quantify how often this discordance occurs. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, guideline-aligned approach to evaluation and follow-up, including when to add an OGTT or alternative markers.

> Let me first confirm the core concept: A1C reflects a weighted average of glycemia over roughly 2–3 months and is less sensitive to short-lived or intermittent hyperglycemia, whereas fasting plasma glucose captures a single time point and is more susceptible to acute and circadian influences, so discordance is expected in certain phenotypes and contexts [^c85d6568] [^76fdbe89].

> Now, I will examine the predominant mechanism. The most common cause of elevated fasting glucose with a normal A1C is isolated impaired fasting glucose due to hepatic insulin resistance and early beta-cell dysfunction that raise hepatic glucose production overnight, while daytime and postprandial glycemia remain near-normal, keeping the A1C below prediabetic thresholds; this is precisely why IFG and A1C identify overlapping but nonidentical populations at risk for diabetes [^8e28d157] [^5a49d240] [^073d8f26].

> Wait, let me verify the strength of evidence for this phenotype. Multiple cohorts show that isolated IFG is common and that A1C in the 5.7–6.4% range captures different individuals than IFG or IGT, with limited overlap among the three prediabetes categories; this supports the concept that IFG-only is a distinct, frequently observed discordant pattern in population screening [^073d8f26] [^05304ccd].

> Hold on, I should also consider medication-induced discordance. Niacin and statins can raise fasting glucose while A1C remains relatively unaffected, reflecting a pharmacologic shift in hepatic glucose output or insulin sensitivity rather than a change in chronic glycemia; this is a recognized clinical scenario where A1C may underestimate dysglycemia risk if used in isolation [^ab6c6dcd].

> I need to check for assay and physiologic interferences that can create spurious discordance. Conditions altering red cell turnover (hemolysis, recent blood loss, hemoglobinopathies, CKD/ESRD, pregnancy) can distort A1C, and certain A1C assays are vulnerable to hemoglobin variants; when discordance is persistent or marked, guidelines advise repeating testing with a different method or using alternative markers like fructosamine or glycated albumin to clarify true glycemia [^c7e66257] [^83e42e55] [^aef9b564].

> Let me consider early dysglycemia dynamics. In the evolution from normoglycemia to diabetes, fasting hyperglycemia can precede A1C elevation by months to years, so a normal A1C does not exclude pathophysiologic progression; this is why serial testing and risk-factor context matter, and why some high-risk patients warrant OGTT even with a normal A1C [^c9ea0933] [^aef9b564].

> Next, I should review how often this discordance occurs. Population syntheses indicate that isolated FPG elevation accounts for a meaningful fraction of newly detected dysglycemia, with estimates around 7–11% of diabetes and roughly 17% of prediabetes depending on the cohort and criteria, underscoring that this is not a rare laboratory curiosity but a clinically significant subset [^6cbb8771] [^37e23e2b].

> I will now examine the clinical implications. Isolated IFG signals increased risk of incident diabetes and cardiovascular disease, albeit generally at lower risk than combined IFG/IGT or A1C-defined prediabetes; nonetheless, lifestyle intervention reduces progression and remains first-line, with metformin considered selectively in high-risk phenotypes or when combined risk factors are present [^38f5bfa0] [^f9682708] [^5c5df066].

> But wait, what if the patient is high risk and the stakes are high? In that case, I should double-check whether an OGTT would change management. OGTT detects impaired glucose tolerance that fasting tests miss and is more predictive of cardiovascular outcomes; guidelines endorse OGTT when discordance persists or when clinical suspicion remains high despite a normal A1C, particularly in older adults, those with metabolic syndrome, or populations with known assay limitations [^aef9b564] [^83e42e55] [^c82732ed].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach. First, confirm the elevated fasting glucose with repeat testing under proper fasting conditions and ensure no preanalytic errors; second, review medications, anemia/hemolysis, CKD, and hemoglobin variants that could bias A1C; third, if discordance persists and risk is nontrivial, obtain an OGTT or consider fructosamine/glycated albumin; fourth, stratify risk using combined glycemic markers and metabolic risk factors; fifth, initiate lifestyle therapy for all with IFG and consider metformin for those with additional risk features or progression on serial testing [^83e42e55] [^aef9b564] [^f9682708].

> In summary, I should confirm the bottom line: the most common cause of elevated fasting glucose with a normal A1C is isolated impaired fasting glucose driven by hepatic insulin resistance and early beta-cell dysfunction, with medication effects and assay/physiologic interferences as important contributors; recognizing this discordance guides appropriate confirmatory testing, risk stratification, and targeted prevention strategies rather than false reassurance from a normal A1C [^8e28d157] [^c85d6568] [^6cbb8771].

Elevated fasting glucose with normal A1C most often reflects **isolated impaired fasting glucose (IFG)** [^8e28d157] due to hepatic insulin resistance and early beta-cell dysfunction, with normal A1C because postprandial glycemia remains intact [^5a49d240]. Other causes include **acute stress or illness** [^c85d6568], **medication effects** (e.g. corticosteroids, niacin, statins) [^ab6c6dcd], and **assay interference** (e.g. hemoglobinopathies, altered RBC turnover) [^93a691dc]. Confirm with repeat fasting glucose or an OGTT [^5ec8d461], and evaluate for cardiometabolic risk factors and reversible contributors [^aef9b564].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms

Several **pathophysiological mechanisms** can explain elevated fasting glucose with normal A1C:

- **Isolated impaired fasting glucose (IFG)**: IFG is characterized by hepatic insulin resistance and impaired basal insulin secretion, leading to elevated fasting glucose but normal postprandial glucose and A1C [^8e28d157] [^5a49d240].

- **Acute stress or illness**: Acute stress, illness, or corticosteroid use can transiently increase fasting glucose without significantly affecting A1C [^14825d03].

- **Medication-induced hyperglycemia**: Certain medications, such as niacin and statins, can elevate fasting glucose while A1C remains normal [^ab6c6dcd].

- **Assay interference**: Hemoglobinopathies, altered red blood cell turnover, or other factors can interfere with A1C assays, leading to falsely normal A1C despite elevated fasting glucose [^93a691dc].

---

## Clinical significance and risk implications

Elevated fasting glucose with normal A1C is clinically significant because it indicates **increased risk** of developing type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease [^38f5bfa0] [^5c5df066]. Individuals with isolated IFG have a higher risk of progression to diabetes than those with normal fasting glucose, although the risk is lower than in those with combined IFG and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) [^38f5bfa0]. Additionally, elevated fasting glucose is associated with increased cardiovascular risk, independent of A1C levels [^c36cc4ce].

---

## Diagnostic criteria and guidelines

According to the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinology (AACE), **prediabetes** can be diagnosed based on any of the following criteria:

| **Test** | **Prediabetes criteria** |
|-|-|
| Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) | 100–125 mg/dL (5.6–6.9 mmol/L) |
| Hemoglobin A1C (A1C) | 5.7–6.4% (39–47 mmol/mol) |
| 2-hour plasma glucose during OGTT | 140–199 mg/dL (7.8–11.0 mmol/L) |

---

Diagnosis of diabetes requires **confirmation** with repeat testing or a different test, and discordant results should prompt further evaluation [^83e42e55].

---

## Clinical evaluation and management

When evaluating a patient with elevated fasting glucose and normal A1C, clinicians should:

- **Confirm results**: Repeat fasting glucose or perform an OGTT to confirm the diagnosis and assess for impaired glucose tolerance [^5ec8d461].

- **Assess risk factors**: Evaluate for cardiovascular risk factors, family history, obesity, and lifestyle factors [^aef9b564].

- **Identify reversible causes**: Review medications, stressors, and acute illnesses that may contribute to elevated fasting glucose [^14825d03].

- **Lifestyle interventions**: Recommend dietary modifications, weight loss, and regular physical activity to reduce the risk of progression to diabetes [^f9682708].

- **Monitor progression**: Regularly monitor fasting glucose, A1C, and cardiovascular risk factors to detect progression early [^8a08ecf7].

---

## Limitations of A1C testing

A1C testing has several limitations that may explain discordant results:

- **Assay interference**: Hemoglobinopathies, altered red blood cell turnover, and certain medications can interfere with A1C assays [^93a691dc].

- **Individual variability**: Genetic and physiological differences can affect the relationship between glucose levels and A1C [^aef9b564].

- **Lower sensitivity**: A1C may be less sensitive in detecting early dysglycemia, particularly in isolated IFG [^c85d6568].

---

## Conclusion

Elevated fasting glucose with normal A1C most commonly reflects **isolated impaired fasting glucose** due to hepatic insulin resistance and early beta-cell dysfunction, with normal A1C because postprandial glycemia remains intact [^8e28d157]. Other causes include acute stress, medication effects, and assay interference. Confirm with repeat fasting glucose or OGTT, assess cardiometabolic risk, and initiate lifestyle interventions to reduce progression risk [^5ec8d461] [^f9682708].

### Elevated A1c in adults without a history of diabetes in the U.S [^fcfe4a92]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

This analysis suggests that elevated A1C (> 6%) is common in the general population of nondiabetic adults. The overall prevalence of A1C > 6% was 3.8%, corresponding to 7.1 million individuals in the U.S. population. Approximately 45% of these individuals have IFG and 45% have fasting glucose ≥ 126 mg/dl. Elevated A1C levels were particularly common among older adults, non-Hispanic blacks, and obese individuals. We found that demographic characteristics and risk factors for type 2 diabetes and its complications including older age, male sex, nonwhite race/ethnicity, lower attained education level, adiposity, and hypercholesterolemia were associated with elevated A1C even in the presence of normal fasting glucose.

Significant advantages of adopting A1C for the screening and diagnosis of diabetes are the high repeatability of the measurement and the high specificity of elevated values for detecting undiagnosed diabetes. Recent recommendations have stated that diagnosis based on A1C should be confirmed using a glucose-dependent test (FPG or OGTT) or by a second A1C. However, glucose-dependent tests are less reliable (repeatable) than A1C. Requiring confirmation of a highly reliable test by one that is less reliable poses problems for the interpretation of any discrepancy between the two values. In a previous study, we analyzed repeated measurements taken ∼2 weeks apart on an unselected sample of individuals without diabetes and found that 100% of individuals with A1C ≥ 7% had a second A1C measurement of ≥ 7% ∼2 weeks later and 80% of individuals with A1C ≥ 6.5 had an A1C level ≥ 6.5% 2 weeks later (Pearson's r = 0.95). There is little marginal gain to repeating the A1C test within a short (several week) time period. Furthermore, we show in the present study that 92% of individuals with A1C ≥ 7.0% also had FPG ≥ 126 mg/dl and 77% of individuals with A1C ≥ 6.5% had FPG ≥ 126 mg/dl. At the population level, elevated A1C is rare in the absence of elevated fasting glucose. Additional advantages to using A1C for screening and/or diagnosis of diabetes include national standardization of the assay, the low analytic variability (high methodological quality of the assay, even when compared with glucose), the widespread availability of the A1C test and its current use in the management and treatment of diabetes, and the fact that the patient does not need to fast.

### The pros and cons of diagnosing diabetes with A1c [^14825d03]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Fasting is not needed for A1C assessment and no acute perturbations (e.g. stress, diet, exercise) affect A1C

Plasma glucose levels are not stable but rather vary throughout the day, mainly in postprandial periods. Although it is believed that fasting glucose levels are reproducible across days, a number of acute perturbations of glucose homeostasis have been described. Acute stress can increase endogenous glucose production substantially and impair glucose utilization. People who are worried about blood sampling or experience a stressful situation in the hours preceding blood sampling can have an increase in fasting glucose concentration. On the contrary, exercise can decrease glucose levels, and an evening or early-morning session of physical exercise can affect the level of fasting glycemia. Moreover, most individuals do not pay attention to the request or are not asked to consume a diet with at least 200 g carbohydrate in the days before testing glucose. Some individuals do not abstain from food in the 8 h before testing, thus arriving to the laboratory in the postabsorptive rather than fasting condition. In addition, smoking or taking certain medications can adversely affect fasting glucose. The lack of appropriate preparation for glucose testing makes FPG less reliable for diabetes diagnosis, with results sometimes falsely elevated and sometimes apparently normal. On the contrary, A1C is not influenced by acute perturbations or insufficient fasting. Indeed, A1C can be measured anytime, irrespective of fasting or feeding.

### Elevated A1c in adults without a history of diabetes in the U.S [^10159e1f]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE

The purpose of this study was to examine the prevalence and correlates of elevated A1C in a large, nationally representative sample of adults without diabetes in the U.S.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

We analyzed data from 15,934 participants aged ≥ 20 years without diagnosed diabetes who had A1C measurements in the 1999–2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a cross-sectional and nationally representative sample of the U.S. population.

RESULTS

The overall prevalence of A1C > 6% was 3.8%, corresponding to 7.1 million adults without diabetes in the U.S. population. Approximately 90% of these individuals had fasting glucose ≥ 100 mg/dl. Older age, male sex, non-Hispanic black race/ethnicity, hypercholesterolemia, higher BMI, and lower attained education were significantly associated with having a higher A1C level even among individuals with normal fasting glucose (< 100 mg/dl) and after multivariable adjustment.

CONCLUSIONS

A single elevated A1C level (A1C > 6%) is common in the general population of adults without a history of diabetes and is highly reliable for the detection of elevated fasting glucose. Nondiabetic adults with elevated A1C are likely to have impaired fasting glucose and an array of other risk factors for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.

### Elevated A1c in adults without a history of diabetes in the U.S [^78e72040]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

It is unclear why nondiabetic non-Hispanic blacks have consistently higher A1C values even in the setting of normal fasting glucose levels and after adjustment for demographic and clinical characteristics. Further research should be conducted to determine whether this disparity stems from racial differences in postprandial glycemia or from racial differences in the tendency of hemoglobin to undergo glycosylation.

This study has several strengths including the large, nationally representative sample of healthy, nondiabetic individuals. We benefited from the rigorous measurement of risk factors using standardized protocols and strict quality control data collection and laboratory procedures in NHANES. Important limitations include the cross-sectional design, which limits our conclusions regarding the temporality of the observed associations. In addition, we had only a single measurement of fasting glucose. The American Diabetes Association recommends repeating an elevated fasting glucose measurement to confirm the diagnosis of diabetes. The use of a single measurement of fasting glucose rather than two will overestimate the prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes. Nonetheless, interpretation of single measurements of fasting glucose and A1C as analyzed in this study reflects a common clinical decision-making setting. Although we cannot rule out the possibility of laboratory differences over time, calibration of A1C to account for the change in laboratories in 2005–2006 using a published equation did not appreciably alter our results. The lack of OGTT data in the fasting glucose subsample for all survey years is an important limitation of this study. Nonetheless, similar results were obtained in multivariable models using the OGTT measurements in the subgroup from the 2005–2006 NHANES.

To date, the diagnostic utility of A1C has largely been assessed by its accuracy (as measured by its sensitivity and specificity) to detect glucose-defined cases of diabetes. The concordance of A1C with fasting glucose is important and, as confirmed by our data, an A1C ≥ 6.5% is specific for the detection of undiagnosed diabetes defined by a single fasting glucose level. Thus, it seems reasonable to adopt a single elevated A1C value as being diagnostic for diabetes. However, the real test of utility for A1C as a screening or diagnostic test of diabetes is its association with long-term clinical outcomes in an initially nondiabetic population specifically in comparison with fasting glucose levels. To address this question we need large, observational studies of A1C in populations of individuals without diabetes.

### A1c level and future risk of diabetes: a systematic review [^c2a188c1]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

Several studies found that A1C is particularly predictive of future diabetes after prior stratification of fasting plasma glucose. This is consistent with prior observations that elevated fasting and 2-h glucose in combination indicates greater risk than either fasting plasma glucose or A1C alone. This improved predictability may be a function of reducing error variance; in other words, conducting a follow-up test clarifies the group with more stable hyperglycemia, and is the main reason that a second test is recommended for a full clinical diagnosis.

Our most important limitation was the lack of original data to model the continuous association between A1C values and incidence. This lack of original data required us to use a modeling approach with which many readers are unfamiliar. Nevertheless, our modeling of average studies resulted in an average incidence value of roughly 1% per year for persons with normal A1C values, an incidence estimate that is consistent with numerous other estimates of the general population. The lack of access to raw data also prevented us from conducting formal ROC analyses of A1C cut-off points to distinguish between eventual cases/noncases or to quantitatively assess the impact of variation in population characteristics on the relationship between A1C and incidence. Our findings could also be influenced by the choice of outcome definition. A1C is more apt to predict diabetes if the outcome is also A1C-based. We did not detect major differences in the A1C/diabetes incidence association according to the choice of glycemic test. Since identifying A1C to predict diabetes defined by glycemic indicators is ultimately circular, future studies should examine the relationship of glycemic markers and later diabetes risk by using several glycemic markers to define incident diabetes, as well as to consider morbidity outcomes.

The growth of diabetes as a national and worldwide public health problem, combined with strong evidence for the prevention of type 2 diabetes with structured lifestyle intervention and metformin, have placed a new importance on the efficient determination of diabetes risk. The selection of specific thresholds, however, will ultimately depend on the interventions likely to be employed and the tradeoffs between sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value. These findings support A1C as a suitably efficient tool to identify people at risk and should help to advance efforts to identify people at risk for type 2 diabetes for referral to appropriate preventive interventions.

### Type 1 diabetes mellitus diagnosis in young adult preceded by years of elevated postprandial and fasting glucose but normal HbA1c: a clinical example of discordance [^c9ea0933]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2022). Medium credibility.

Herein, a case study of an individual with fasting blood glucose (FBG), glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and postprandial blood glucose (PBG) measures from the 3 years preceding their type 1 diabetes mellitus diagnosis is used to highlight discordance among these common diagnostic tests. Data from the patient's own records, participation in clinical research, and healthcare provider were collated. Measures of FBG (90–160 mg/dL) and PBG (195–247 mg/dL) were elevated for 3 years with a normal HbA1c (5.0–5.4%) and without any symptoms. Overt symptoms, including polyuria, polydipsia, and unexplained weight loss, manifested 3 years later prompting the patient to contact their physician. Testing revealed an elevated HbA1c (9.8%) and presence of glutamic acid decarboxylase autoantibodies (GAD) (9 IU/mL). Daily body composition measures and weighed food logs from the 3 months preceding and 4 months after diagnosis illustrate the effects of glucose spilling and inadequate insulin levels. Both FBG and PBG indicated diabetes 3 years prior to HbA1c. While FBG, PBG, and HbA1c are considered equally appropriate for screening and diagnosing diabetes, this case study highlights the need to revisit important distinctions between these tests that explain their frequent discordance.

### Diabetes mellitus: screening and diagnosis [^1a2e9a0c]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Diabetes mellitus is one of the most common diagnoses made by family physicians. Uncontrolled diabetes can lead to blindness, limb amputation, kidney failure, and vascular and heart disease. Screening patients before signs and symptoms develop leads to earlier diagnosis and treatment, but may not reduce rates of end-organ damage. Randomized trials show that screening for type 2 diabetes does not reduce mortality after 10 years, although some data suggest mortality benefits after 23 to 30 years. Lifestyle and pharmacologic interventions decrease progression to diabetes in patients with impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose tolerance. Screening for type 1 diabetes is not recommended. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends screening for abnormal blood glucose and type 2 diabetes in adults 40 to 70 years of age who are overweight or obese, and repeating testing every three years if results are normal. Individuals at higher risk should be considered for earlier and more frequent screening. The American Diabetes Association recommends screening for type 2 diabetes annually in patients 45 years and older, or in patients younger than 45 years with major risk factors. The diagnosis can be made with a fasting plasma glucose level of 126 mg per dL or greater; an A1C level of 6.5% or greater; a random plasma glucose level of 200 mg per dL or greater; or a 75-g two-hour oral glucose tolerance test with a plasma glucose level of 200 mg per dL or greater. Results should be confirmed with repeat testing on a subsequent day; however, a single random plasma glucose level of 200 mg per dL or greater with typical signs and symptoms of hyperglycemia likely indicates diabetes. Additional testing to determine the etiology of diabetes is not routinely recommended.

### Contributions of 2-h post-load glucose, fasting blood glucose and glycosylated haemoglobin elevations to the prevalence of diabetes and pre-diabetes in adults: a systematic analysis of global data [^156664bc]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Diabetes is a growing global public health concern, affecting over 537 million individuals worldwide — over 90% of whom have type 2 diabetes. Even more people are affected by pre‐diabetes, an intermediate stage between normoglycaemia and diabetes, although the introduction of this term has caused some concerns about over‐diagnosis and over‐treatment. Detection of diabetes and pre‐diabetes aims to identify individuals at increased risk of macrovascular (e.g. cardiovascular disease) and microvascular complications (e.g. retinopathy) and inform subsequent interventions, including pharmacological treatment. The diagnostic criteria for diabetes have been revised several times over the past few decades. Two‐hour post‐load glucose (2hPG) was first used to diagnose diabetes, and then fasting blood glucose (FPG) and glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) were added to the diagnostic criteria. Likewise, the criteria for diagnosing pre‐diabetes include impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and elevated HbA1c. According to the latest guidelines of the American Diabetes Association (ADA), a diagnosis of diabetes or pre‐diabetes can be made when any of these glycaemic indicators exceed their respective thresholds. Although diagnostic practice in other countries or populations may vary in terms of the more commonly used diagnostic measures (e.g. whether HbA1c testing is preferred), the cutoffs adopted (e.g. the lower thresholds of FPG and HbA1c for diagnosing pre‐diabetes) and diagnostic rigour (e.g. whether repeat testing is required if the first testing is positive), most countries' guidelines recommend that 2hPG, FPG and HbA1c can all be used for the diagnosis of diabetes and pre‐diabetes. The increase in the number of diagnostic measures would inevitably increase the number of new cases and prevalence of diabetes and pre‐diabetes, because the test results of different diagnostic measures do not align with each other perfectly. For example, in the case of isolated FPG elevation, the FPG level exceeds the diagnostic threshold for diabetes, while 2hPG and HbA1c are 'normal'

### Reframing prediabetes: a call for better risk stratification and intervention [^1388b133]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Prediabetes is an intermediate state of glucose homeostasis whereby plasma glucose concentrations are above normal but below the threshold of diagnosis for diabetes. Over the last several decades, criteria for prediabetes have changed as the cut points for normal glucose concentration and diagnosis of diabetes have shifted. Global consensus does not exist for prediabetes criteria; as a result, the clinical course and risk for type 2 diabetes vary. At present, we can identify individuals with prediabetes based on three glycemic tests (hemoglobin A1c, fasting plasma glucose, and 2-h plasma glucose during an oral glucose tolerance test). The majority of individuals diagnosed with prediabetes meet only one of these criteria. Meeting one, two, or all glycemic criteria changes risk for type 2 diabetes, but this information is not widely known and does not currently guide intervention strategies for individuals with prediabetes. This review summarizes current epidemiology, prognosis, and intervention strategies for individuals diagnosed with prediabetes and suggests a call for more precise risk stratification of individuals with prediabetes as elevated (one prediabetes criterion), high risk (two prediabetes criteria), and very high risk (three prediabetes criteria). In addition, the roles of oral glucose tolerance testing and continuous glucose monitoring in the diagnostic criteria for prediabetes need reassessment. Finally, we must reframe our goals for prediabetes and prioritize intensive interventions for those at high and very high risk for type 2 diabetes.

### Elevated A1c in adults without a history of diabetes in the U.S [^9dee3fee]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Figure 1
Count in millions (95% CI) of persons at different A1C cut points in the U.S. 2000 Census population aged ≥ 20 years without diabetes.

Figure 2 displays the distributions of A1C in individuals with normal fasting glucose (fasting glucose < 100 mg/dl), IFG (fasting glucose 100– < 126 mg/dl), and undiagnosed diabetes (fasting glucose ≥ 126 mg/dl), revealing substantially overlapping distributions in individuals with normal glucose and IFG but a right-skewed distribution in individuals with undiagnosed diabetes. The mean A1C levels in individuals with normal fasting glucose, IFG, and undiagnosed diabetes were 5.2 ± 0.01, 5.5 ± 0.01, and 6.9 ± 0.16%, respectively (not shown). Similarly, the distribution of individuals in the fasting glucose categories (< 100, 100–125, and ≥ 126 mg/dl) varied substantially, depending on the A1C cut point. For instance, among individuals with A1C > 6.0%, 45.6% had undiagnosed diabetes, 45.3% had IFG, and 9.1% had normal fasting glucose. In contrast, among individuals with an A1C ≥ 7.0%, 91.7% had undiagnosed diabetes, 6.6% had IFG, and only 1.7% had normal glucose levels. A comparison of the distribution of fasting glucose categories among individuals with A1C > 6.1% and A1C ≥ 6.5% yielded intermediate results. Among individuals with A1C > 6%, 53.3% had undiagnosed diabetes, 38.6% had IFG, and 8.1% had normal fasting glucose. Among individuals with A1C ≥ 6.5%, 76.7% had undiagnosed diabetes, 19.6% had IFG, and 1.7% had normal fasting glucose (supplementary Figure A, available in an online appendix at).

### Prediabetes [^5c5df066]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2025). High credibility.

Prediabetes or intermediate hyperglycaemia represents a preliminary stage in the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In addition to an increased likelihood of developing T2DM, individuals with prediabetes have an elevated risk of various vascular and non-vascular complications. No consensus has been achieved on the ideal screening strategy for prediabetes, with fasting plasma glucose concentration, glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) and the oral glucose tolerance test being the most frequently measured parameters. The two major phenotypes of prediabetes, that is, impaired fasting glucose and impaired glucose tolerance, may represent different pathophysiologies with varying natural history, risk of adverse outcomes and responsiveness to treatment. Most of the evidence for managing prediabetes focuses on lifestyle modification with or without medications in individuals with overweight or obesity and impaired glucose tolerance. Whether these interventions are beneficial in individuals with impaired fasting glucose and those of normal body weight is unclear, as is the cost-effectiveness and sustainability of pharmacotherapy for treating prediabetes. Large-scale national T2DM prevention programmes are currently under way to assess whether the benefits of interventions for prediabetes can be translated to the community setting.

### Approach to the patient with prediabetes [^726300e3]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2008). Low credibility.

Prediabetes consists of impaired fasting glucose and/or impaired glucose tolerance and is a significant risk factor for the development of type 2 diabetes, microvascular, and macrovascular disease. The values used to define prediabetes are arbitrary, because prediabetes represents an intermediary category along the continuum from normal glucose levels and tolerance to overt hyperglycemia. The progression from prediabetes to type 2 diabetes occurs over many years, strong evidence to support intervention to delay the progression from prediabetes to diabetes. Large, randomized prospective studies with lifestyle intervention and/or various modes of pharmacotherapy have demonstrated successful delay of diabetes. Several issues in the management of prediabetes remain controversial, such as the role of pharmacotherapy and when to escalate treatment. This article will review some of the issues surrounding the identification and treatment of prediabetes, with an interpretation of the available data to help guide management.

### Can' personalized diagnostics' promote earlier intervention for dysglycaemia? Hypothesis ready for testing [^816d55b6]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

The risk associated with progression to diabetes as well as for cardiovascular complications increases along a continuum, rather than being threshold-dependent. How can we identify those with glucose levels in the upper reaches of normal who are most in need of a preventive intervention? With present criteria, we are likely excluding many individuals who have heightened risk. We introduce here the possibility of using a "personalized" glucose profile to encourage early intervention in subjects in whom glucose metabolism is deteriorating (on an individual level) but not yet abnormal on a population-based norm. We further suggest that "personalized profiles" of hemoglobin A1c and basal plasma insulin may also help encourage appropriately early intervention. That the first line therapies are so effective, safe and simple make these more sensitive approaches very attractive.

### Contributions of 2-h post-load glucose, fasting blood glucose and glycosylated haemoglobin elevations to the prevalence of diabetes and pre-diabetes in adults: a systematic analysis of global data [^6cbb8771]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Aims

Some studies found that the association of fasting blood glucose (FPG) or glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) elevation with diabetic complications was not statistically significant after controlling for the confounding caused by 2-h post-load glucose (2hPG) elevation. Furthermore, inclusion of HbA1c as a diagnostic measure for diabetes has raised some concerns about over-diagnosis and over-treatment. This study aimed to quantify the contributions of 2hPG, FPG and HbA1c elevations to the prevalence of diabetes and pre-diabetes respectively, by synthesising global data, which can serve as essential parameters in cost-effectiveness analysis and inform updates of practice guidelines about prevention and control of diabetes.

Materials and Methods

The levels of 2hPG, FPG and HbA1c were classified as either 'elevated' or 'normal' Each distinct combination of these markers (e.g., 'elevated 2hPG, normal FPG and normal HbA1c') defined a unique subgroup, resulting in a total of seven subgroups for both diabetes and pre-diabetes. The contribution of 2hPG elevation to diabetes prevalence was calculated as its proportion among all diabetes cases; the same approach was applied to FPG and HbA1c elevations, as well as to pre-diabetes prevalence. To retrieve global data, five electronic databases (i.e. PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure and Wan Fang) were searched from their inception to February 2024. Studies that fulfilled the following criteria were considered eligible: (1) were conducted in adults without previously diagnosed diabetes; (2) were cross-sectional studies or baseline surveys of cohort studies (which can be regarded as a special type of cross-sectional studies); and (3) reported directly or allowed for calculation of the proportion of each subgroup out of all diabetes and/or the proportion of each subgroup out of all pre-diabetes. A 10-item tool selected from literature was used to appraise the quality of included data. The proportions of each subgroup among all diabetes cases were meta-analysed across eligible studies with the random-effects model using the MetaXL software. Similar meta-analyses were conducted for pre-diabetes.

Results

Thirty-two eligible studies were identified, with 25 reporting on newly detected diabetes (n = 289094) and 15 on pre-diabetes (n = 221988) and the majority of them using identical diagnostic cutoffs proposed by the American Diabetes Association (ADA). The mean age of participants ranged from 24 to 68years (median of mean ages: 51). Twenty-four studies (75%) were assessed as at low risk for ≥ 7 out of the 10 quality items. In the general population, based on the ADA criteria, the weighted prevalence of diabetes and pre-diabetes was 15% and 69%, respectively. Among those with newly detected diabetes (n = 24214), 69% had elevated 2hPG, 44% elevated FPG and 61% elevated HbA1c; 7% had isolated FPG elevation; 20% had isolated HbA1c elevation. Among those with newly detected pre-diabetes (n = 133621), 33% had elevated 2hPG, 51% elevated FPG and 68% elevated HbA1c; 17% had isolated FPG elevation; 34% had isolated HbA1c elevation. Sensitivity analyses stratified by participant comorbidities and study quality produced results consistent with the main findings.

Conclusions

The largest contributors to the prevalence of diabetes and pre-diabetes are 2hPG and HbA1c, respectively. Isolated FPG and HbA1c elevations account for over a quarter of all diabetes and more than half of all pre-diabetes.

### Mildly elevated liver transaminase levels: causes and evaluation [^4d6e2176]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Mild, asymptomatic elevations (less than five times the upper limit of normal) of alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase levels are common in primary care. It is estimated that approximately 10% of the U.S. population has elevated transaminase levels. An approach based on the prevalence of diseases that cause asymptomatic transaminase elevations can help clinicians efficiently identify common and serious liver disease. The most common causes of elevated transaminase levels are nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and alcoholic liver disease. Uncommon causes include drug-induced liver injury, hepatitis B and C, and hereditary hemochromatosis. Rare causes include alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency, autoimmune hepatitis, and Wilson disease. Extrahepatic sources, such as thyroid disorders, celiac sprue, hemolysis, and muscle disorders, are also associated with mildly elevated transaminase levels. The initial evaluation should include an assessment for metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance (i.e., waist circumference, blood pressure, fasting lipid level, and fasting glucose or A1C level); a complete blood count with platelets; measurement of serum albumin, iron, total iron-binding capacity, and ferritin; and hepatitis C antibody and hepatitis B surface antigen testing. The nonalcoholic fatty liver disease fibrosis score and the alcoholic liver disease/nonalcoholic fatty liver disease index can be helpful in the evaluation of mildly elevated transaminase levels. If testing for common causes is consistent with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and is otherwise unremarkable, a trial of lifestyle modification is appropriate. If the elevation persists, hepatic ultrasonography and further testing for uncommon causes should be considered.

### Contributions of basal and postprandial hyperglycemia over a wide range of A1c levels before and after treatment intensification in type 2 diabetes [^fbb4d752]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to measure the relative contribution of BHG versus PPHG in a common and specific clinical setting. We evaluated seven-point glucose profiles in a large group of patients with type 2 diabetes with A1C > 7.0% on OAD, for whom the relative importance of BHG versus PPHG has direct relevance to further therapy. Because 100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L) is considered the upper limit of normal fasting plasma glucose by the American Diabetes Association, the current analysis defined basal values above this level as elevated. We aimed to determine, using our method of calculation, whether before intensifying therapy these patients showed the A1C-dependent patterns of hyperglycemic exposure proposed by the earlier findings and to define how adding basal insulin and other interventions altered the initially observed patterns of hyperglycemia.

### ACP releases updated guidance statement on A1c targets for… [^6e77c902]. AAFP (2018). Low credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- Goals of glycemic control should be individualized to each patient, after discussing harms and benefits, preferences, overall health status, treatment burden, and expense.
- An A1C target of 7% to 8% is recommended for most patients, because targets of 7% or less do not appear to result in reduced risk of mortality or macrovascular events.
- The medication regimen may be de-escalated in patients with an A1C level less than 6. 5%, because there is no evidence of clinical benefit in patients at this level. From the AFP Editors More than 9% of persons in the United States have type 2 diabetes mellitus. Increased blood glucose levels in these patients can lead to polyuria, polydipsia, weight loss, and dehydration. Although lowering blood glucose levels can decrease the risk of these symptoms and the associated complications, there are still disadvantages to doing so, including adverse effects, increased treatment burden, and expense.

A1C measurement is one method for determining blood glucose levels, but it is inconsistent and can change based on a patient's race and ethnicity. Previous guidelines have recommended the use of medications to reach A1C targets; however, an ideal target remains debatable. This guidance statement from the American College of Physicians aims to help physicians achieve appropriate A1C targets via medication for nonpregnant patients with type 2 diabetes based on a review of six health care organization guidelines. Guidance Statements Goals of glycemic control via medication should be individualized to each patient, after talking about benefits and harms of more vs. less control, preferences, overall health status, treatment burden, and expense. Because targets of 7% or less vs. approximately 8% do not appear to result in reduced risk of mortality or macrovascular events, an A1C target of 7% to 8% is recommended for most patients.

Treatment in older persons and those with a shorter life expectancy should aim to reduce symptoms of hyperglycemia, rather than to achieve A1C targets. In addition, because achieving certain A1C targets is associated with more harm than good, these targets are not recommended in any patient expected to live fewer than 10 years because of older age, living in a long-term care facility, or with a chronic condition.

### Standards of medical care in diabetes – 2010 [^b72aa498]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

As is the case for individuals found to have IFG and IGT, individuals with an A1C of 5.7–6.4% should be informed of their increased risk for diabetes as well as CVD and counseled about effective strategies to lower their risks (see IV. PREVENTION/DELAY OF TYPE 2 DIABETES). As with glucose measurements, the continuum of risk is curvilinear, so that as A1C rises, the risk of diabetes rises disproportionately. Accordingly, interventions should be most intensive and follow-up should be particularly vigilant for those with an A1C > 6.0%, who should be considered to be at very high risk. However, just as an individual with a fasting glucose of 98 mg/dl (5.4 mmol/l) may not be at negligible risk for diabetes, individuals with an A1C < 5.7% may still be at risk, depending on the level of A1C and presence of other risk factors, such as obesity and family history.

Table 3 summarizes the categories of increased risk for diabetes.

### Elevated HbA1c and fasting plasma glucose in predicting diabetes incidence among older adults: are two better than one? [^c8eb4847]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

In summary, we found that IFG and elevated HbA 1c are associated with increased odds for subsequent diabetes in older adults. Obtaining both tests improves the ability to predict diabetes occurrence. Older adults with both IFG and elevated HbA 1c are at very high risk for diabetes, whereas those with two normal tests are unlikely to develop the disease over the next 7 years. Future studies of new-onset diabetes in older adults are needed to better understand the natural history of this condition and to document the effect of diabetes screening on clinical outcomes in the elderly.

### Should prediabetes be treated pharmacologically? [^9719bda2]. Diabetes Therapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Key Summary Points

Prediabetes is a dysglycemia with glycemic values between normal and those that define diabetes. People with prediabetes are characterized by decreased insulin sensitivity (insulin resistance) and impaired insulin secretion that cannot meet the extra demands on the pancreatic beta cells imposed by the insulin resistance. Prediabetes increases the risk for the subsequent development of diabetes. This risk begins with a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) concentration of 4.6–4.8 mmol/L and increases in a curvilinear manner, with the chances of developing diabetes progressively rising the closer the dysglycemia is to the diagnostic criteria for diabetes.

The criteria for the diagnosis of prediabetes differs between the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the international community (Table 1). Moreover, in contrast to the recommendation that the diagnosis of diabetes be confirmed, there is no such recommendation for the diagnosis of prediabetes. This is unfortunate because on a repeat oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) within 2–6 weeks, approximately half of individuals with Impaired Glucose Tolerance (IGT) have a normal result. If the international Impaired Fasting Glucose (IFG) criterion were used to diagnose prediabetes, 32% were normal on repeat testing. OGTTs are rarely used in clinical practice (except in pregnancy) so the diagnosis of prediabetes rests on FPG and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) testing. Depending on where one lives and the test used for the diagnosis, there is a marked difference in whether an individual will be diagnosed with prediabetes or not. To illustrate using the largest possible difference, the prevalence of prediabetes in the USA diagnosed by a FPG concentration of 5.6–6.9 mmol/L is 37.5% compared with the international prevalence diagnosed by an HbA1c level of 42–46 mmol/mol of 5.8%.

### Insulin concerns and promises [^c36cc4ce]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Hertzel Gerstein (Hamilton, Ontario, Canada) discussed early insulin treatment of type 2 diabetes, asking, "How early is early?" What, he asked, does a high glucose or A1C mean? At what glucose/A1C levels do problems develop? How are glucose/A1C levels controlled? Do any existing trials provide clues? And, finally, what will we learn from the ongoing ORIGIN trial?

In a meta-analysis of the relationship between fasting glucose concentration and vascular disease, with 8.5 million person-years of follow-up, the level that should be considered normal fasting glucose in terms of vascular risk, even with advanced diabetes, is 90–95 mg/dL. "The key to maintaining that normal fasting glucose is the pancreas and its insulin secretion", Gerstein said, implying that "the best test of the β-cell is your glucose level". His meta-analysis of prospective studies showed that IGT is associated with a 2.5-fold higher risk of nonfatal CVD and a 1.5-fold higher risk of mortality and that fasting glucose > 110 mg/dL without elevation in 2-h glucose was associated with 20, 28, and 21% increases in risks of myocardial infarction, nonfatal CVD, and mortality, respectively. Fasting glucose > 100 mg/dL was, adjusted for age, cigarettes, BMI, and blood pressure, associated with 7 and 15% increases in cardiovascular risks in men and in women, respectively. "Categories of increased glucose that are clearly not diabetic", Gerstein stated, "carry increased risk", with coronary mortality beginning to increase at fasting glucose levels of ∼95 mg/dL. In the 33-year follow-up of the Whitehall study, glucose levels measured 2 h after 50 g oral glucose showed a continuous relationship with coronary mortality beginning at 83 mg/dL; mortality increased 22% for every 18 mg/dL increase up to 200 mg/dL, leading to the notion of "a continuum of dysglycemia". Similar analysis with A1C shows an 18% increase in mortality risk for every 1% increase, "extending right into the normal range" as well.

### Diagnosis and classification of diabetes: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^747ef59d]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Fasting or 2-hour plasma glucose testing — In individuals without symptoms, fasting plasma glucose (FPG) or 2-hour plasma glucose (2-h PG) can be used for screening and diagnosis of diabetes, while measurement of random plasma glucose is sufficient to diagnose diabetes when symptoms of hyperglycemia or hyperglycemic crisis are present plus random plasma glucose ≥ 200 mg/dL [≥ 11.1 mmol/L]. In nonpregnant individuals, FPG (or A1C) is typically preferred for routine screening due to the ease of administration; however, the 2-h PG (OGTT) testing protocol diagnoses more diabetes than the other two tests and is preferentially recommended for screening for some conditions (e.g., cystic fibrosis-related diabetes or posttransplantation diabetes mellitus). Individuals may have difficulty fasting for the full 8-h period or may misreport their fasting status, and glycolysis and sample handling can affect results; people should follow a mixed eating pattern with at least 150 g of carbohydrates on the 3 days prior to OGTT, and antecedent carbohydrate restriction in the days prior to OGTT can falsely elevate postchallenge glucose levels, potentially resulting in a false-positive OGTT.

### Combining glycosylated hemoglobin A1c and fasting plasma glucose for diagnosis of type 2 diabetes in Chinese adults [^f74b2ce2]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a common disease reflecting metabolic disorders characterized with hyperglycemia, which may lead to specific long-term complications affecting heart, brain, eyes, kidneys and nervous system. Currently, diagnosis of T2DM in Chinese adults is principally according to the 1999 World Health Organization (WHO) diagnostic criteria, namely, a person can be diagnosed as T2DM when he or she has 1) a random plasma glucose ≥ 11.1 mmol/l accompanied by typical symptoms of diabetes such as thirst and polyuria; or 2) a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) ≥ 7.0 mmol/l; or 3) a 2-hour plasma glucose (2hPG) after an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) ≥ 11.1 mmol/l. These diagnostic criteria are determined based on the relationship between glucose levels and the risk of subsequent long-term complications.

The accuracy of glucose measurement, however, is more or less affected by the pre-analytic instability and biologic variability of glucose concentrations within and between days. Moreover, OGTT requires a second blood sample and is therefore more costly and time-consuming, bringing inconvenient in logistics and causing uncomfortable feeling in individuals. Compared with 2hPG in OGTT, FPG measurement is more reproducible and simpler to perform in clinics and communities. Therefore FPG measurement is usually used alone to screen T2DM in China. Due to that a certain proportion of T2DM patients have a normal FPG but an elevated 2hPG (≥ 11.1 mmol/l), almost half diabetes patients remain undiagnosed in China. A more efficient and practical method is needed to identify the individuals with diabetes in general population.

Hemoglobin A 1c (HbA 1c), a glycosylated form of hemoglobin, reflects one's plasma glucose levels over past 2–3 months and is less influenced by recent diet and emotional stress. HbA 1c level is a convenient and reliable measurement of chronic glycemia, and can be tested concurrently with FPG at fasting. HbA 1c is associated with the risk of long-term diabetic complications and has been used to monitor glycemic control status in prevalent patients with diabetes for about 30 years. Substantial studies, including one conducted in Chinese population, have proved that HbA 1c may be a helpful tool for diagnosing T2DM. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) has used an HbA 1c cut-point of 48 mmol/mol (6.5%) as one of diagnostic criteria for T2DM in its 2010 Clinical Practice Recommendations.

### Impaired glucose tolerance and impaired fasting glycaemia: the current status on definition and intervention [^8e28d157]. Diabetic Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

A workshop was convened by the International Diabetes Federation to review the latest information relating to the risks associated with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and impaired fasting glycaemia (IFG) for future diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD). The workshop sought to address three questions: (i) are the current definitions of IGT and IFG appropriate; (ii) are IFG and IGT risk factors, risk markers or diseases; (iii) what interventions (if any) should be recommended for people with IFG and IGT? The determinants of elevated fasting glucose and 2-h plasma glucose in an oral glucose tolerance test (2-HPG) levels differ. Raised hepatic glucose output and a defect in early insulin secretion are characteristic of the former, and peripheral insulin resistance is most characteristic of the latter. Therefore, it is not surprising that the concordance between the categories of IFG and IGT is limited. In all prevalence studies to date only half or less of people with IFG have IGT, and even a lower proportion (20–30%) with IGT also have IFG. In the majority of populations studied, IGT is more prevalent than IFG, and there is a difference in phenotype and gender distribution between the two categories. IFG is substantially more common amongst men and IGT slightly more common amongst women. The prevalence of IFG tends to plateau in middle age whereas the prevalence of IGT rises into old age. Both IFG and IGT are associated with a substantially increased risk of developing diabetes, with the highest risk in people with combined IFG and IGT. Because IGT is commoner than IFG in most populations it is more sensitive (but slightly less specific) for identifying people who will develop diabetes. In most populations studied, 60% of people who develop diabetes have either IGT or IFG 5 years or so before, with the other 40% having normal glucose tolerance at that time. The limited published data suggest that both isolated IFG (I-IFG) and isolated IGT (I-IGT) are similarly associated with cardiovascular risk factors, such as hypertension and dyslipidaemia, with the highest risk in those with combined IFG and IGT. However, some data have suggested that I-IGT is more strongly associated with hypertension and dyslipidaemia (features of the metabolic syndrome) than I-IFG. In unadjusted analyses both IFG and IGT are associated with CVD and total mortality. In separate analyses for fasting and 2-HPG adjusted for other cardiovascular risk factors (from the DECODE study) there remains a continuous relationship between 2-HPG and mortality, but an independent relationship with fasting glucose is only found above 7.0 mmol/l. Glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) levels are continuously and positively associated with CVD and total mortality independent of other CVD risk factors. Life style interventions, including weight loss and increased physical activity, are highly effective in preventing or delaying the onset of diabetes in people with IGT. Two randomized controlled trials of individuals with IGT found that life style intervention studies reduce the risk of progressing to diabetes by 58%. The oral hypoglycaemic drugs metformin and acarbose have also been shown to be effective, but less so than the life style measures. Similar data do not yet exist for the effectiveness of such interventions in people with I-IFG. Larger studies are required to evaluate the effects of interventions on cardiovascular outcomes in people with IGT. Cost effective strategies to identify people with IGT for intervention should be developed and evaluated. The use of simple risk scores to assess who should undergo an oral glucose tolerance test is one promising approach, although these will need to be population-specific. In conclusion, IGT and IFG differ in their prevalence, population distribution, phenotype, and risk of total mortality and CVD. The consensus of the workshop was: 1. The diagnostic thresholds for all categories of glucose intolerance should be revisited in the light of the latest evidence. There was no clear consensus (with current evidence) on whether IFG and IGT should be classified as diseases, but they clearly represent risk factors and risk markers for diabetes and CVD, respectively. 2. Both IGT and IFG are similarly associated with an increased risk of diabetes, but IGT is more strongly associated with CVD outcomes. 3. Risks are higher when IGT and IFG coexist. 4. Life style interventions are highly effective in delaying or preventing the onset of diabetes in people with IGT and may reduce CVD and total mortality, but the latter requires formal testing.

### Development of type 2 diabetes mellitus in people with intermediate hyperglycaemia [^38f5bfa0]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Intermediate hyperglycaemia (IH) is characterised by one or more measurements of elevated blood glucose concentrations, such as impaired fasting glucose (IFG), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and elevated glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). These levels are higher than normal but below the diagnostic threshold for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The reduced threshold of 5.6 mmol/L (100 mg/dL) fasting plasma glucose (FPG) for defining IFG, introduced by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) in 2003, substantially increased the prevalence of IFG. Likewise, the lowering of the HbA1c threshold from 6.0% to 5.7% by the ADA in 2010 could potentially have significant medical, public health and socioeconomic impacts.

Objectives

To assess the overall prognosis of people with IH for developing T2DM, regression from IH to normoglycaemia and the difference in T2DM incidence in people with IH versus people with normoglycaemia.

Search Methods

We searched MEDLINE, Embase, ClincialTrials.gov and the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal up to December 2016 and updated the MEDLINE search in February 2018. We used several complementary search methods in addition to a Boolean search based on analytical text mining.

Selection Criteria

We included prospective cohort studies investigating the development of T2DM in people with IH. We used standard definitions of IH as described by the ADA or World Health Organization (WHO). We excluded intervention trials and studies on cohorts with additional comorbidities at baseline, studies with missing data on the transition from IH to T2DM, and studies where T2DM incidence was evaluated by documents or self-report only.

Data Collection and Analysis

One review author extracted study characteristics, and a second author checked the extracted data. We used a tailored version of the Quality In Prognosis Studies (QUIPS) tool for assessing risk of bias. We pooled incidence and incidence rate ratios (IRR) using a random-effects model to account for between-study heterogeneity. To meta-analyse incidence data, we used a method for pooling proportions. For hazard ratios (HR) and odds ratios (OR) of IH versus normoglycaemia, reported with 95% confidence intervals (CI), we obtained standard errors from these CIs and performed random-effects meta-analyses using the generic inverse-variance method. We used multivariable HRs and the model with the greatest number of covariates. We evaluated the certainty of the evidence with an adapted version of the GRADE framework.

Main Results

We included 103 prospective cohort studies. The studies mainly defined IH by IFG 5.6 (FPG mmol/L 5.6 to 6.9 mmol/L or 100 mg/dL to 125 mg/dL), IFG 6.1 (FPG 6.1 mmol/L to 6.9 mmol/L or 110 mg/dL to 125 mg/dL), IGT (plasma glucose 7.8 mmol/L to 11.1 mmol/L or 140 mg/dL to 199 mg/dL two hours after a 75 g glucose load on the oral glucose tolerance test, combined IFG and IGT (IFG/IGT), and elevated HbA1c (HbA1c 5.7: HbA1c 5.7% to 6.4% or 39 mmol/mol to 46 mmol/mol; HbA1c 6.0: HbA1c 6.0% to 6.4% or 42 mmol/mol to 46 mmol/mol). The follow-up period ranged from 1 to 24 years. Ninety-three studies evaluated the overall prognosis of people with IH measured by cumulative T2DM incidence, and 52 studies evaluated glycaemic status as a prognostic factor for T2DM by comparing a cohort with IH to a cohort with normoglycaemia. Participants were of Australian, European or North American origin in 41 studies; Latin American in 7; Asian or Middle Eastern in 50; and Islanders or American Indians in 5. Six studies included children and/or adolescents. Cumulative incidence of T2DM associated with IFG 5.6, IFG 6.1, IGT and the combination of IFG/IGT increased with length of follow-up. Cumulative incidence was highest with IFG/IGT, followed by IGT, IFG 6.1 and IFG 5.6. Limited data showed a higher T2DM incidence associated with HbA1c 6.0 compared to HbA1c 5.7. We rated the evidence for overall prognosis as of moderate certainty because of imprecision (wide CIs in most studies). In the 47 studies reporting restitution of normoglycaemia, regression ranged from 33% to 59% within one to five years follow-up, and from 17% to 42% for 6 to 11 years of follow-up (moderate-certainty evidence). Studies evaluating the prognostic effect of IH versus normoglycaemia reported different effect measures (HRs, IRRs and ORs). Overall, the effect measures all indicated an elevated risk of T2DM at 1 to 24 years of follow-up. Taking into account the long-term follow-up of cohort studies, estimation of HRs for time-dependent events like T2DM incidence appeared most reliable. The pooled HR and the number of studies and participants for different IH definitions as compared to normoglycaemia were: IFG 5.6: HR 4.32 (95% CI 2.61 to 7.12), 8 studies, 9017 participants; IFG 6.1: HR 5.47 (95% CI 3.50 to 8.54), 9 studies, 2818 participants; IGT: HR 3.61 (95% CI 2.31 to 5.64), 5 studies, 4010 participants; IFG and IGT: HR 6.90 (95% CI 4.15 to 11.45), 5 studies, 1038 participants; HbA1c 5.7: HR 5.55 (95% CI 2.77 to 11.12), 4 studies, 5223 participants; HbA1c 6.0: HR 10.10 (95% CI 3.59 to 28.43), 6 studies, 4532 participants. In subgroup analyses, there was no clear pattern of differences between geographic regions. We downgraded the evidence for the prognostic effect of IH versus normoglycaemia to low-certainty evidence due to study limitations because many studies did not adequately adjust for confounders. Imprecision and inconsistency required further downgrading due to wide 95% CIs and wide 95% prediction intervals (sometimes ranging from negative to positive prognostic factor to outcome associations), respectively. This evidence is up to date as of 26 February 2018.

Authors' Conclusions

Overall prognosis of people with IH worsened over time. T2DM cumulative incidence generally increased over the course of follow-up but varied with IH definition. Regression from IH to normoglycaemia decreased over time but was observed even after 11 years of follow-up. The risk of developing T2DM when comparing IH with normoglycaemia at baseline varied by IH definition. Taking into consideration the uncertainty of the available evidence, as well as the fluctuating stages of normoglycaemia, IH and T2DM, which may transition from one stage to another in both directions even after years of follow-up, practitioners should be careful about the potential implications of any active intervention for people 'diagnosed' with IH.

### American association of clinical endocrinology clinical practice guideline: developing a diabetes mellitus comprehensive care plan-2022 update [^747e1b73]. Endocrine Practice (2022). High credibility.

AACE 2022 diabetes guideline — glucose testing and hemoglobin A1C (A1C) interpretation defines normal, prediabetes, and diabetes thresholds using fasting plasma glucose (FPG), 2-hour plasma glucose (2-h PG), random plasma glucose (PG), and A1C. Normal: FPG < 100 mg/dL, 2-h PG < 140 mg/dL, and A1C < 5.5%. Prediabetes: impaired fasting glucose (IFG) with FPG ≥ 100 to 125 mg/dL, impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) with 2-h PG ≥ 140 to 199 mg/dL, and A1C 5.7% to 6.4% for screening of prediabetes. Diabetes: FPG ≥ 126 mg/dL; 2-h PG ≥ 200 mg/dL or random PG ≥ 200 mg/dL + symptoms; and A1C ≥ 6.5% (secondary). A1C should be used only for screening prediabetes and diagnosis should be confirmed with glucose testing; for diabetes, glucose criteria are preferred, the same test should be repeated on a different day, two abnormal test results from the same sample confirm diagnosis, and a glucose level ≥ 200 mg/dL in the presence of diabetes mellitus (DM) symptoms does not need confirmation.

### Postchallenge glucose, A1c, and fasting glucose as predictors of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease: a 10-year prospective cohort study [^5a49d240]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

We compared A1C, a recently proposed indicator for high risk of diabetes, with the currently used 2-h and fasting glucose as predictors of incident type 2 diabetes and CVD during 10 years. To our knowledge, this is the first study comparing the recently proposed range of elevated A1C (5.7–6.4%) with both 2-h and fasting glucose, measuring the outcome with an OGTT. Furthermore, data comparing A1C and 2-h glucose regarding future cardiovascular risk are scarce and have been focused on mortality and yielded controversial results. Here, we examined outcome of individuals with new CVD presenting to a tertiary care center, thereby adding important evidence to the use of A1C as a predictor of incident macrovascular complications in those without a history of diabetes.

Different markers detected different individuals at risk of diabetes. Importantly, a marked amount of diabetes was preceded by elevation in one of the glycemic markers only, with limited overlap among the three. Fasting and 2-h glucose reflect different pathophysiological mechanisms of abnormal glucose homeostasis. The pathophysiology of isolated IFG includes reduced hepatic insulin sensitivity, β-cell dysfunction, and reduced β-cell mass. With isolated IGT, peripheral insulin sensitivity is reduced with a near-normal hepatic insulin sensitivity and progressive loss of β-cell function. In contrast with acute-phase markers, A1C is a widely used marker of chronic glycemia, reflecting average blood glucose levels over 2–3 months.

Our results lend support to the recent suggestion that an intermediate range of A1C may indicate high risk for type 2 diabetes, particularly if combined with fasting glucose. The range of A1C used in previous studies assessing the risk of future diabetes has varied, and elevated risk has been shown in ranges between 5.5 and 6.5%. A1C of 5.6–6.4% carried a hazard ratio of 13.7 for use of antidiabetes drug treatment at 3 years in Japanese, lending support to our findings in a similar range, but with a markedly longer follow-up period in our study. To our knowledge, this is the first longitudinal study of the nondiabetic A1C range and incident type 2 diabetes, as measured by an OGTT, in which the recently proposed A1C range of 5.7–6.4% has been evaluated.

3.4 The proportions of different combinations of, andamong participants newly detected with diabetes

Of the 25 studies reporting data on newly detected diabetes,15 were conducted in the general population and all of these adopted the ADA diagnostic criteria. Meta‐analysis of the 15 studies showed that the weighted prevalence of diabetes was 15% (see Table S4 for results of other scenarios). As shown in Figures 2A and S1, among adults with newly detected diabetes (n = 24 214), 69% (95% CI, 61%–75%; I² = 99%) had elevated 2hPG, 44% (95% CI, 41%–51%; I² = 97%) elevated FPG, and 61% (95% CI, 52%–69%; I² = 99%) elevated HbA1c; 11% (95% CI, 7%–16%; I² = 99%) had normal 2hPG but elevated FPG (regardless of their HbA1c levels); 7% (95% CI, 3%–11%; I² = 99%) had normal 2hPG and HbA1c but elevated FPG (i.e. isolated FPG elevation); 20% (95% CI, 12%–24%; I² = 99%) had normal 2hPG and normal FPG but elevated HbA1c (i.e. isolated HbA1c elevation).

5 CONCLUSION

This study shows that the largest contributors to the prevalence of diabetes and pre‐diabetes are 2hPG and HbA1c, respectively. FPG and HbA1c measurements identify a large number of new cases, with isolated FPG and HbA1c elevations accounting for over a quarter of all diabetes and more than half of all pre‐diabetes. However, not all of the new cases, particularly those with isolated FPG or HbA1c elevation, are at higher risk of diabetic complications or could benefit from treatment. While FPG and HbA1c are convenient to measure, current evidence shows that 2hPG could better stratify the risk of macrovascular complications, and those with 2hPG elevation have been consistently demonstrated to be able to benefit from treatment. Thus, refinement of the diagnostic algorithms for diabetes and pre‐diabetes may be warranted, for instance, through modifying the strategy of joint use of different glycaemic measures or reducing the number of diagnostic measures. To better inform clinical decision‐making and policy development, more longitudinal studies focusing on the prognostic validity of each glycaemic measure and the treatment benefit in individuals identified by them, particularly FPG and HbA1c, are needed, and both macrovascular and microvascular complications of diabetes should be examined as important outcomes in such studies.

### A1c versus glucose testing: a comparison [^76fdbe89]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

PERSPECTIVE

Notwithstanding the use of glucose (FPG and/or the OGTT) as the "gold standard" for the diagnosis of diabetes for many years, glucose testing suffers from several deficiencies. The requirement that the subject be fasting at the time the blood is drawn is a considerable inconvenience. While our ability to measure glucose has improved, inherent biological variability can produce very large differences within and among individuals. In conjunction with lack of sample stability, which is difficult to overcome in clinical practice, these factors results in lack of reproducibility of glucose testing.

A1C, which reflects chronic blood glucose values, is routinely used in monitoring glycemic control and guiding therapy. The significant reduction in microvascular complications with lower A1C and the absence of sample lability, combined with several other advantages (Table 3), have led to the recommendation by some organizations that A1C be used for screening and diagnosis of diabetes. Accumulating evidence suggests that racial differences in A1C values may be present, and the possible clinical significance of this needs to be determined. Importantly, A1C cannot be measured in certain conditions. Despite these caveats, A1C can be measured accurately in the vast majority of people. A comprehension of the factors that influence A1C values and the conditions where it should not be used will produce accurate and clinically meaningful results. The convenience of sampling at any time without regard to food ingestion makes it likely that measurement of A1C will result in the detection of many of the millions of people with diabetes who are currently undiagnosed.

The predicted probability of having screen-detected diabetes with isolated elevated HbA1c or FPG.

a, b, The probability, by sex, age and region, of participants who did not have previous diagnosis of diabetes of having elevated HbA1c (≥ 6.5%) at different FPG and BMI levels (a) and elevated FPG (≥ 7.0 mmol l −1) at different HbA1c and BMI levels (b). The probabilities were calculated using coefficients of prediction equation model 8, with measurement method set to laboratory for prediction. These results show the probability of having screen-detected diabetes if the second biomarker had been measured, for a person whose first biomarker was below the clinical threshold for diabetes diagnosis.

In Fig. 4, the coefficients from model 8 were used to calculate the probability that a person without a history of diabetes diagnosis, based on measurement of a single glycemic biomarker that is above the clinical threshold, would have elevated level of the other (elevated HbA1c at a specific FPG and BMI level (Fig. 4a) or elevated FPG at a specific HbA1c and BMI level (Fig. 4b)). These results show that people without a previous diagnosis who had an elevated level of one diabetes biomarker had varying probabilities of also being elevated for the other depending on region, age, sex and BMI. In particular, for those with screen-detected elevated HbA1c, the probability of also having FPG ≥ 7.0 mmol l −1 surpassed 90% in some region-age-BMI combinations. The exceptions were south Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean, where isolated elevated HbA1c and isolated elevated FPG were both common and hence only partially predicted one another.

The probabilities were calculated using coefficients of prediction equation model 8, with measurement method set to laboratory for prediction. These results show the probability that the second biomarker, had it been measured, would be above the clinical threshold for diabetes diagnosis, for a person whose first biomarker was above the clinical threshold for diabetes diagnosis. Having elevated levels of both biomarkers has high positive predictive value for subsequent clinical diagnosis and risk of complications.

### International expert committee report on the role of the A1c assay in the diagnosis of diabetes [^93a691dc]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Limitations of A1C as the recommended means of diagnosing diabetes

The A1C assay is the test of choice for the chronic management of diabetes and is now being recommended for its diagnosis; however, there are parts of the world where the costs of providing the assay preclude its routine use. In such circumstances, clinicians should continue to use the previously recommended approaches to diagnose diabetes based on glucose measurements. The International Expert Committee encourages clinicians worldwide to move as quickly as possible to A1C testing using standardized methods and instrumentation. However, the decision to change to A1C assays as the means of diagnosing diabetes should take into account the performance of local A1C assays and the local prevalence of conditions that may interfere with the assay. (See below.)

Although the discussion above argues for using the A1C assay for the diagnosis of diabetes in nonpregnant individuals, there are patient conditions that either will require a specific A1C assay method or will preclude A1C testing. First, some hemoglobin traits, such as HbS, HbC, HbF, and HbE, interfere with some A1C assay methods. Currently, many assay methods can correct for the presence of the most common hemoglobin traits, and affinity assays that are unaffected by hemoglobin traits may be used. Second, any condition that changes red cell turnover, such as hemolytic anemia, chronic malaria, major blood loss, or blood transfusions, will lead to spurious A1C results. Clinicians must be aware of these conditions, particularly in populations in which they are more prevalent. As in the setting where A1C assays are unavailable, the traditional diagnostic tests (e.g. FPG, 2HPG) must be used in individuals in whom interpreting the A1C is problematic. Third, A1C levels appear to increase with age, but the extent of the change, whether it relates to factors other than glucose metabolism, and the effect of the age-related increases on the development of complications are not sufficiently clear to adopt age-specific values in a diagnostic scheme. Similarly, racial disparities in A1C, based on putative differences in the relationship between glucose levels and A1C, have been suggested; however, here too, their etiology and significance are unclear, and it is premature to establish race-specific diagnostic values. Finally, there are rare clinical settings, such as rapidly evolving type 1 diabetes, where the A1C level will not have had time to "catch up" with the acute elevations in glucose levels; however, in these very rare cases, diabetes should be diagnosable with typical symptoms and casual glucose levels > 200 mg/dl (11.1 mmol/l) despite a nondiagnostic A1C level.

### Implications of alternative definitions of prediabetes for prevalence in U.S. adults [^3feb328a]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Increased levels of glycemia in the prediabetic range, measured by fasting or postchallenge glucose or by A1C can serve as simple and reasonably accurate predictors of subsequent type 2 diabetes risk. Above and beyond its association with diabetes, hyperglycemia at the prediabetic level is associated with increased risk of subsequent cardiovascular disease. The value of glycemic measures is further strengthened by evidence that diabetes risk can be reduced with structured lifestyle interventions and/or metformin among individuals with levels of glycemia above normal but below the diagnostic threshold for diabetes. This means that measures of glycemia can serve as practical indicators for referral to diabetes prevention programs.

A series of definitions to classify people at elevated glycemic risk have been recommended, including impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), impaired fasting glucose (IFG), and "prediabetes". In 1979, the National Diabetes Data Group (NDDG) defined IGT as fasting plasma glucose (FPG) < 140 mg/dL and 2-h plasma glucose values ranging from 140 to 199 mg/dL. The World Health Organization (WHO) also adopted this recommendation. The term IFG was introduced in 1997, whereby FPG values from 110 to 125 mg/dL additionally differentiated the metabolic state between normal and diabetic. In 2003, the Expert Committee on the Diagnosis and Classification of Diabetes Mellitus lowered the FPG cut point for IFG to 100 mg/dL, which optimized sensitivity and specificity in predicting diabetes and made the prevalence of prediabetes more comparable to IGT prevalence. The WHO did not change its previous recommendations, placing greater emphasis on 2-h plasma glucose.

Most recently, the American Diabetes Association recommended an A1C range of 5.7–6.4% to identify individuals at high risk for future diabetes. Because an overnight fast is not required to measure A1C, this change is expected to facilitate identification of people at risk for diabetes who could benefit from intervention.

Each change in definition has implications for the population prevalence of prediabetes, along with potential devotion of resources. Thus, we examined nationally representative data to 1) describe the prevalence of prediabetes among the U.S. population according to different glycemic measures and combinations of measures and 2) examine the degree of agreement between measures.

### Postchallenge glucose, A1c, and fasting glucose as predictors of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease: a 10-year prospective cohort study [^4da9b1ab]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

Breakdown of type 2 diabetes as predicted by the three tests is illustrated in Fig. 2. In total, 65.7% of the cases of newly diagnosed diabetes were predicted by a raise in ≥ 1 markers at baseline. The most common condition to precede diabetes was IGT (40.6%), followed by elevated A1C (32.8%), followed by IFG (21.9%). An elevation in an isolated marker predicted type 2 diabetes in a remarkable number of subjects. Percentages of isolated IGT, isolated elevated A1C, and isolated IFG preceding diabetes were 23.4, 14.1% and 6.3%, respectively (P = 0.31). A relatively small percentage of cases of diabetes were preceded by a combination of two markers, with all three elevated in only 7.8% of participants who developed diabetes. Specificity of IGT, IFG, and A1C for incident type 2 diabetes was 85.9–92.6% (Fig. 3). AUC ranged from 0.69 for 2-h glucose to 0.61 for fasting glucose (P = 0.36 for equality).

### Impaired glucose tolerance and impaired fasting glucose [^cc2e6f0b]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Impaired glucose tolerance and impaired fasting glucose form an intermediate stage in the natural history of diabetes mellitus. From 10 to 15 percent of adults in the United States have one of these conditions. Impaired glucose tolerance is defined as two-hour glucose levels of 140 to 199 mg per dL (7.8 to 11.0 mmol) on the 75-g oral glucose tolerance test, and impaired fasting glucose is defined as glucose levels of 100 to 125 mg per dL (5.6 to 6.9 mmol per L) in fasting patients. These glucose levels are above normal but below the level that is diagnostic for diabetes. Patients with impaired glucose tolerance or impaired fasting glucose have a significant risk of developing diabetes and thus are an important target group for primary prevention. Risk factors for diabetes include family history of diabetes, body mass index greater than 25 kg per m2, sedentary lifestyle, hypertension, dyslipidemia, history of gestational diabetes or large-for-gestational-age infant, and polycystic ovary syndrome. Blacks, Latin Americans, Native Americans, and Asian-Pacific Islanders also are at increased risk for diabetes. Patients at higher risk should be screened with a fasting plasma glucose level. When the diagnosis of impaired glucose tolerance or impaired fasting glucose is made, physicians should counsel patients to lose 5 to 7 percent of their body weight and engage in moderate physical activity for at least 150 minutes per week. Drug therapy with metformin or acarbose has been shown to delay or prevent the onset of diabetes. However, medications are not as effective as lifestyle changes, and it is not known if treatment with these drugs is cost effective in the management of impaired glucose tolerance.

Three years after a landmark study demonstrated that early diagnosis of and intervention of pre-diabetes can substantially reduce progression to type 2 diabetes, the majority of people with IFG and/or IGT were undiagnosed and untreated. Whether this is due to physicians being unaware of the evidence, unconvinced by the evidence, or clinical inertia is unclear. Consideration should be given to national policies to improve upon this situation such as public and provider education programs.

### Contributions of 2-h post-load glucose, fasting blood glucose and glycosylated haemoglobin elevations to the prevalence of diabetes and pre-diabetes in adults: a systematic analysis of global data [^d32c5af0]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

The management of pre‐diabetes is more controversial than that of diabetes, both because the huge number of people labelled as having this condition (two‐thirds of which being FPG and HbA1c elevations, as shown by this study) and because of the uncertainty around the causal relation between FPG and HbA1c and diabetic complications. Like the case of diabetes, a large body of evidence shows that the three glycaemic measures, when used individually, were each associated with increased cardiovascular disease and mortality, but few studies examined their 'independent effects' on the outcomes after controlling for the confounding caused by the other two glycaemic measures. One of the few studies that did so was Lind et al. which found that the 2hPG level in people with IGT was associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease after adjusting for FPG, 1‐h post‐load glucose, HbA1c and other major risk factors, whereas FPG and HbA1c were not associated with the outcome when analysed in the same model. However, a limitation of that study was its relatively small sample size (n = 504) and number of outcome events (n = 34). Other studies conducted in people with pre‐diabetes were mostly focused on one or two glycaemic measures only and thus were not able to clarify whether the observed association with outcomes (if any) resulted from confounding caused by other glycaemic measures. Because of this, whether it is justifiable to intervene with or 'manage' pre‐diabetes defined by FPG and HbA1c is open to question. Indeed, several randomised controlled trials have shown that lifestyle interventions and even some pharmacological treatment in people with pre‐diabetes did not lead to reductions in cardiovascular disease or mortality, although the progression to diabetes was slowed down to some extent. Thus, further prospective studies evaluating the independent effects of FPG and HbA1c levels on future diabetic complications among the pre‐diabetes population are warranted.

### Screening for diabetes and pre-diabetes with proposed A1c-based diagnostic criteria [^6a01dd57]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

Although A1C screening may be of limited value, better test characteristics appear to be provided by measuring random plasma glucose or glucose 1 h after a 50-g oral glucose challenge; either could be obtained opportunistically during office visits, at any time of day, and without a prior fast. Other tests or combinations of tests may also be useful, and it is possible that health economics analyses would identify one or another test as being more cost-effective in different patient populations and clinical settings. We still need to identify previously unrecognized diabetes and pre-diabetes to initiate preventive management.

### Limited overlap between intermediate hyperglycemia as defined by A1c 5.7–6.4%, impaired fasting glucose, and impaired glucose tolerance [^05304ccd]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Comparison of the prevalences of IH as diagnosed by A1C 5.7–6.4%, IFG, and IGT, showed that isolated forms of prediabetes are common at the population level. Differences in CVD risk factors were observed between the i-A1C, i-IFG, and i-IGT groups. Individuals with A1C 5.7–6.4% with normal OGTT were characterized by higher BMI, central obesity, and a more adverse lipid profile.

The comparability of A1C 5.7–6.4% with IFG and IGT as a marker of IH, particularly regarding associated CVD risk factors, is not well known. Data from previous studies using A1C and OGTT for the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes have been controversial regarding cardiovascular risk profile. In the Telde Study, Spanish subjects diagnosed with A1C were characterized by a higher BMI and waist circumference and lower levels of HDL cholesterol compared with the OGTT group. In contrast, in the Danish Inter99 study population, with a high prevalence of male smokers, individuals with A1C-defined diabetes were leaner and had a higher prevalence of lipid abnormalities compared with the OGTT group. Our results are in agreement with those of the Telde Study, showing that individuals classified with a prediabetic A1C of 5.7–6.4% were characterized by higher BMI, waist circumference, and triglycerides and lower HDL cholesterol levels. Further studies in different populations are required to evaluate the finding that the different markers seem to identify in part different individuals.

The advantage of using A1C is less day-to-day variability compared with OGTT. The 2-h glucose levels have higher variability than fasting glucose levels, but both have higher variability than A1C. The day-to-day variability of the OGTT is a limitation that must be considered when interpreting these results, because OGTT was performed only once in this epidemiological study.

Our study has several strengths. It was performed in an unselected nondiabetic population. We showed that differences in CVD risk profiles of type 2 diabetes are already present in the prediabetic stages of A1C 5.7–6.4%, IFG, and IGT. The study is limited because the OGTT was performed only once, and capillary samples were used for the 2-h glucose measurement, which may have given slightly higher values than venous plasma samples; however, this effect at the population level is marginal. Findings from our study are also limited to an aging white population.

### Postprandial hyperglycemia as an etiological factor in vascular failure [^32d829dc]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2009). Low credibility.

Figure 2
Pathophysiology of postprandial hyperglycemia. Hyperglycemic spikes following every meal induce oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction and inflammatory reactions.

Recent evidence suggests that almost 2 of 3 patients with symptomatic cardiovascular disease have abnormal glucose homeostasis. A significant number of these patients are not detected by increased fasting glucose levels, but rather by the presence of elevated glucose levels following a meal or during an oral glucose tolerance test. Glucose intolerance is generally established by a 75 g glucose load test, with impaired glucose tolerance, or prediabetes, defined as a 2-hour postload glucose level of 140 to 200 mg/dl and overt type 2 diabetes as a postload glucose level > 200 mg/dl. Postprandial hyperglycemia often occurs, even in the setting of good diabetic control assessed by hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and fasting glucose levels. Population studies have shown that a fasting glucose level as low as 90 mg/dl may be associated with a 2-hour postprandial glucose level > 200 mg/dl. In the early stages of type 2 diabetes, even when fasting glucose and HbA1c are within nornal ranges, postprandial hyperglycemia causes macrovascular complications such as myocardial infarction or stroke as well as microvascular complications. Emerging data indicate that even impaired glucose tolerance may predispose to progression of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular events. There is evidence that postprandial hyperglycemia, but not fasting hyperglycemia, independently predicts the occurrence of cardiovascular events. For example, the Funagata Diabetes Study showed consistently that 1- or 2-hour postload glucose levels were better predictors of cardiovascular risk than either fasting glucose or HbA1c levels, while the Diabetic Epidemiology: Collaborative Analysis of Diagnosis Criteria in Europe (DECODE) study demonstrated a continuous graded and direct relationship between 2-hour postload glucose levels and risk for cardiovascular death. Even in patients classified as having normal glucose tolerance with a postload glucose < 140 mg/dl, the level of postload glycemia correlates with the risk of cardiovascular death and all-cause mortality. The risk for postload glycemia begins to increase at levels > 80 mg/dl and by 140 mg/dl, the point at which patients are traditionally classified as having impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) or prediabetes, cardiovascular risk is already increased by 58%.

### Recommendations for management of diabetes during ramadan: update 2010 [^1aa74e2e]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

Pregnancy and fasting during Ramadan

Pregnancy is a state of increased insulin resistance and insulin secretion and of reduced hepatic insulin extraction. Fasting glucose concentrations are lower and postprandial glucose and insulin levels are substantially higher in healthy pregnant women than in healthy women who are not pregnant. Elevated blood glucose and A1C levels in pregnancy are associated with increased risk for major congenital malformations. Fasting during pregnancy would be expected to carry a high risk of morbidity and mortality to the fetus and mother, although controversy exists. While pregnant Muslim women are exempt from fasting during Ramadan, some with known diabetes (type 1, type 2, or gestational) insist on fasting. These women constitute a high-risk group, and their management requires intensive care.

In general, women with pregestational or gestational diabetes are at very high risk and may be strongly advised not to fast during Ramadan. However, if they insist on fasting, special attention should be given to their care. Pre-Ramadan evaluation of their medical condition is essential. This includes preconception care with emphasis on achieving near-normal blood glucose and A1C values, counseling about maternal and fetal complications associated with poor glycemic control, and education focused on self-management skills. Ideally, patients should be managed in high-risk clinics staffed by an obstetrician, diabetologists, a nutritionist, and diabetes nurse educators. The management of pregnant patients during Ramadan is based on an appropriate diet and intensive insulin therapy. The issues discussed above concerning the management of type 1 and type 2 diabetes also apply to this group, with the exception that more frequent monitoring and insulin dose adjustment is necessary.

Management of hypertension and dyslipidemia

Dehydration, volume depletion, and a tendency toward hypotension may occur with fasting during Ramadan, especially if the fast is prolonged and is associated with excessive perspiration. Hence, the dosage and/or the type of antihypertensive medications may need to be adjusted to prevent hypotension. Diuretics may not be appropriate during Ramadan for some patients. It is a common practice that the intake of foods rich in carbohydrates and saturated fats is increased during Ramadan. Appropriate counseling should be given to avoid this practice, and agents that were previously prescribed for the management of elevated cholesterol and triglycerides should be continued.

### Elevated A1c in adults without a history of diabetes in the U.S [^73eaf36f]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Figure 2
Weighted smoothed histogram comparing distributions of A1C by fasting glucose category, adults aged ≥ 20 years without diagnosed diabetes, U.S. 1992–2006.

Multivariable logistic regression analysis demonstrated that older age, male sex, non-Hispanic black and Mexican American race/ethnicity, hypertension, higher BMI, less than a high school education, and higher C-reactive protein levels were all associated with the prevalence of elevated A1C (A1C > 6%) even after multivariable adjustment in this population of adults without diagnosed diabetes (supplementary Table A). Current alcohol consumption was associated with lower A1C. We next examined the same variables but limited the population to individuals with normal A1C (A1C < 6%) and with a fasting glucose < 100 mg/dl and assessed the association with having an A1C level above the median in this population (A1C > 5.2%) (Table 2). Similar associations as in the model of A1C > 6% were observed in the full population. In Table 2, older age, male sex, non-Hispanic black and Mexican-American race/ethnicity, hypercholesterolemia, higher BMI, and lower attained education were significantly associated with having a higher A1C level, even after adjustment. Current smoking was associated with higher A1C and current alcohol consumption with lower A1C in this population with normal glucose levels. Additional adjustment for fasting glucose did not alter these results (data not shown). Our results were also unchanged in sensitivity analyses of NHANES 2005–2006, the only years for which OGTT data were available, in which we further excluded individuals with impaired glucose tolerance (2-h glucose ≥ 140 mg/dl) from our multivariable models (data not shown).

### A new look at screening and diagnosing diabetes mellitus [^ccce3482]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

Diabetes is underdiagnosed. About one third of people with diabetes do not know they have it, and the average lag between onset and diagnosis is 7 yr. This report reconsiders the criteria for diagnosing diabetes and recommends screening criteria to make case finding easier for clinicians and patients.

Participants

R.M.B. invited experts in the area of diagnosis, monitoring, and management of diabetes to form a panel to review the literature and develop consensus regarding the screening and diagnosis of diabetes with particular reference to the use of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). Participants met in open session and by E-mail thereafter. Metrika, Inc. sponsored the meeting.

Evidence

A literature search was performed using standard search engines.

Consensus Process

The panel heard each member's discussion of the issues, reviewing evidence prior to drafting conclusions. Principal conclusions were agreed on, and then specific cut points were discussed in an iterative consensus process.

Conclusions

The main factors in support of using HbA1c as a screening and diagnostic test include: 1) HbA1c does not require patients to be fasting; 2) HbA1c reflects longer-term glycemia than does plasma glucose; 3) HbA1c laboratory methods are now well standardized and reliable; and 4) errors caused by nonglycemic factors affecting HbA1c such as hemoglobinopathies are infrequent and can be minimized by confirming the diagnosis of diabetes with a plasma glucose (PG)-specific test. Specific recommendations include: 1) screening standards should be established that prompt further testing and closer follow-up, including fasting PG of 100 mg/dl or greater, random PG of 130 mg/dl or greater, or HbA1c greater than 6.0%; 2) HbA1c of 6.5–6.9% or greater, confirmed by a PG-specific test (fasting plasma glucose or oral glucose tolerance test), should establish the diagnosis of diabetes; and 3) HbA1c of 7% or greater, confirmed by another HbA1c- or a PG-specific test (fasting plasma glucose or oral glucose tolerance test) should establish the diagnosis of diabetes. The recommendations are offered for consideration of the clinical community and interested associations and societies.

### Contributions of 2-h post-load glucose, fasting blood glucose and glycosylated haemoglobin elevations to the prevalence of diabetes and pre-diabetes in adults: a systematic analysis of global data [^f4e79e3f]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

3.5 The proportions of different combinations of, andamong adult participants newly detected with pre‐diabetes

Of the 15 studies reporting data on newly detected pre‐diabetes,7 were conducted in the general population, and 5 of them adopted the ADA diagnostic criteria. Meta‐analysis of these five studies showed that the weighted prevalence of pre‐diabetes was 69% (see Table S4 for the results based on other criteria or populations). As shown in Figures 3A and S2, among adults with newly detected pre‐diabetes (n = 133 621), 33% (95% CI, 21%–47%; I² = 100%) had elevated 2hPG, 51% (95% CI, 42%–60%; I² = 100%) elevated FPG and 68% (95% CI, 59%–75%; I² = 100%) elevated HbA1c; 33% (95% CI, 23%–41%; I² = 100%) had normal 2hPG but elevated FPG (regardless of their HbA1c levels); 17% (95% CI, 9%–23%; I² = 100%) had normal 2hPG and HbA1c but elevated FPG (i.e. isolated FPG elevation); 34% (95% CI, 22%–40%; I² = 100%) had normal 2hPG and normal FPG but elevated HbA1c (i.e. isolated HbA1c elevation). Two general population‐based studies adopted investigators‐defined diagnostic criteria for pre‐diabetes. A Finland study (n = 486; FPG cutoff: 5.6–6.0 mmol/L) demonstrated that 2hPG elevation contributed most to pre‐diabetes (58%), followed by HbA1c (42%) and then FPG (27%) elevations, while a German study of middle‐aged and older adults (n = 2660; FPG cutoff: 6.1–6.9 mmol/L) found that HbA1c elevation contributed most to the prevalence of pre‐diabetes (71%), followed by 2hPG (37%) and then FPG (23%) elevations.

Prediabetes — definitions and confirmation: Prediabetes is identified by impaired fasting glucose (IFG), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), or A1C range thresholds, with glucose testing required for confirmation; specifically, IFG is "100 to 125 mg/dL", IGT is "a PG value of 140 to 199 mg/dL 2 hours after ingesting 75 g of glucose", and A1C is "between 5.7% and 6.4%", and "A1C should be used only for screening for prediabetes" with diagnosis "confirmed with glucose testing".

### Pre-diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular risk [^35bd21df]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

Pre-diabetes represents an elevation of plasma glucose above the normal range but below that of clinical diabetes. Pre-diabetes can be identified as either impaired fasting glucose (IFG) or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). The latter is detected by oral glucose tolerance testing. Both IFG and IGT are risk factors for type 2 diabetes, and risk is even greater when IFG and IGT occur together. Pre-diabetes commonly associates with the metabolic syndrome. Both in turn are closely associated with obesity. The mechanisms whereby obesity predisposes to pre-diabetes and metabolic syndrome are incompletely understood but likely have a common metabolic soil. Insulin resistance is a common factor; systemic inflammation engendered by obesity may be another. Pre-diabetes has only a minor impact on microvascular disease; glucose-lowering drugs can delay conversion to diabetes, but whether in the long run the drug approach will delay development of microvascular disease is in dispute. To date, the drug approach to prevention of microvascular disease starting with pre-diabetes has not been evaluated. Pre-diabetes carries some predictive power for macrovascular disease, but most of this association appears to be mediated through the metabolic syndrome. The preferred clinical approach to cardiovascular prevention is to treat all the metabolic risk factors. For both pre-diabetes and metabolic syndrome, the desirable approach is lifestyle intervention, especially weight reduction and physical activity. When drug therapy is contemplated and when the metabolic syndrome is present, the primary consideration is prevention of cardiovascular disease. The major targets are elevations of cholesterol and blood pressure.

### Contributions of 2-h post-load glucose, fasting blood glucose and glycosylated haemoglobin elevations to the prevalence of diabetes and pre-diabetes in adults: a systematic analysis of global data [^af843d6f]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

More importantly, not all of the newly identified patients are at increased risk of diabetic complications. For example, previous studies consistently found that 2hPG was independently associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease after adjustment for FPG, HbA1c and non‐glycaemic risk factors, whereas FPG was often not associated with risk of cardiovascular disease after adjusting for 2hPG and HbA1c. These findings suggest that some patients (e.g. those with isolated FPG elevation) may derive little benefit from glucose‐lowering drug treatment in terms of preventing diabetic complications as their baseline risk is low in the first place. Thus, it would be of interest to know the contribution of each glycaemic measure to the prevalence of diabetes and pre‐diabetes, for instance, the proportions of 'individuals with isolated FPG elevation' and 'individuals with abnormal values for two or three diagnostic measures' (who are at different risks of complications), out of all patients detected by the three glycaemic measures. This information can serve as essential parameters in cost‐effective analysis and development of clinical guidelines about diabetes management.

Against this background, we conducted a systematic review to quantify the contributions of 2hPG, FPG and HbA1c to the prevalence of diabetes and pre‐diabetes, respectively, and to examine how the patients identified by one glycaemic measure overlap with those identified by other measures.

### Lumateperone (Caplyta) [^5a2cbf5e]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.6 Metabolic
Changes

Antipsychotic drugs have caused metabolic changes, including hyperglycemia, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and weight gain. Although all of the drugs in the class have been shown to produce some metabolic changes, each drug has its own specific risk profile.

Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus

Hyperglycemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar coma or death, has been reported in patients treated with antipsychotics. There have been reports of hyperglycemia in patients treated with CAPLYTA. Assess fasting plasma glucose before or soon after initiation of antipsychotic medication and monitor periodically during long-term treatment.

Schizophrenia

In pooled data from short-term (4- to 6-week), placebo-controlled trials of adult patients with schizophrenia, mean changes from baseline and the proportion of patients with shifts from normal to greater than normal levels of fasting glucose in patients treated with CAPLYTA were similar to those in patients treated with placebo.

In an uncontrolled open-label trial of CAPLYTA for up to 1 year in patients with stable schizophrenia, the percentages of patients with shifts in fasting glucose and insulin values from normal to high were 8% and 12%, respectively. 4.7% of patients with normal hemoglobin A1c (< 6.5%) at baseline developed elevated levels (≥ 6.5%) post-baseline.

### Contributions of 2-h post-load glucose, fasting blood glucose and glycosylated haemoglobin elevations to the prevalence of diabetes and pre-diabetes in adults: a systematic analysis of global data [^7bb720fb]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

This systematic review showed that 2hPG elevation is the largest contributor (69%) to the prevalence of diabetes, followed by HbA1c (61%) elevation and then FPG elevation (44%). Inclusion of FPG as a diagnostic measure increases the number of cases by 11% relatively on top of those already identified by 2hPG, and inclusion of HbA1c further increases it by 20% on top of those already identified by 2hPG and FPG. Isolated FPG and HbA1c elevations account for 7% and 20% of all diabetes, respectively. For pre‐diabetes, HbA1c elevation is the largest contributor (68%) to the prevalence, followed by FPG elevation and then 2hPG elevation. Isolated FPG and HbA1c elevations account for 17% and 34% of all pre‐diabetes, respectively. According to the estimate of the International Diabetes Federation, approximately 589 million people are currently living with diabetes. Based on this number and the findings of this systematic review, the numbers of cases with diabetes or pre‐diabetes newly identified by FPG and HbA1c were estimated and shown in Table 3. However, it should be noted that these were extrapolations based on data from multiple sources, with inherent assumptions and potential for overestimation, and should therefore be interpreted as rough approximations with appropriate caution.

### Inadequacies of absolute threshold levels for diagnosing prediabetes [^3d1f8ec8]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Prediabetes comprising Impaired Fasting Glucose (IFG) and Impaired Glucose Tolerance (IGT) represents an intermediate stage of altered glucose metabolism between normal glucose levels and type 2 diabetes mellitus and is associated with an increased risk for the development of diabetes and cardiovascular disease. There is considerable evidence that glucose levels lower than those meeting the current definition of prediabetes may also be associated with similar risks particularly in high-risk individuals. Prediabetes is often unrecognized and therefore constitutes a major public health concern suggesting the need for earlier intervention than is currently recommended.

### Eye care of the patient with diabetes mellitus [^df70b640]. AOA (2019). High credibility.

Prediabetes — individuals whose blood glucose levels do not meet the criteria for diabetes but are higher than normal are classified as having prediabetes, and they have an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and stroke; age, race, and co-morbid hypertension, obesity, and dyslipidemia are significant risk factors associated with progression. Persons with prediabetes have impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), impaired fasting glucose (IFG), or abnormal glycosylated hemoglobin (A1C) levels, with IGT diagnosed only by the Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) and defined by a 2-hour plasma glucose in the 75-g OGTT of 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L) to 199 mg/dL (11.0 mmol/L), IFG defined as fasting glucose 100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L) to 125 mg/dL (6.9 mmol/L), and an A1C test level between 5.7 percent and 6.4 percent considered prediabetes.

### Glycemic variability: should we and can we prevent it? [^f236d24b]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

Diabetes is characterized by glycemic disorders that include both sustained chronic hyperglycemia and acute glucose fluctuations. There is now cogent evidence for the deleterious effects of sustained chronic hyperglycemia that results in excessive protein glycation and generation of oxidative stress. The role of glucose variability from peaks to nadirs is less documented, but there are many reasons to think that both upward (postprandial) and downward (interprandial) acute fluctuations of glucose around a mean value activate the oxidative stress. As a consequence, it is strongly suggested that a global antidiabetic strategy should be aimed at reducing to a minimum the different components of dysglycemia (i.e. A1C, fasting and postprandial glucose, as well as glucose variability). All the therapeutic agents that act on postprandial glucose excursions seem of particular interest for reducing the latter parameter (i.e., the glucose instability). Particular attention should be paid to such emerging therapeutic agents as the glucagon-like peptide 1 agonists and the dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP)-IV inhibitors that act through the incretin pathway.

RESULTS

Among the 1,690 participants during the baseline visit, the mean (SD) FPG was 92.8 mg/dL (9.5), and the median was 92.0 mg/dL (interquartile range 86–98). Respective values for HbA 1c were 5.3% (0.4) and 5.3% (5.1–5.6). The baseline characteristics of study participants are presented in Table 1. There were 779 (46.1%) men and 1,152 (68.2%) white participants in the present analysis. Of the study participants, 358 (21.2%) were identified as having IFG at baseline, 376 (22.2%) as having elevated HbA 1c, and 1,125 (66.6%) as having normal glucose tolerance (i.e. neither elevated FPG nor elevated HbA 1c). Among participants with dysglycemia, 189 (33.5%) had IFG only, 207 (36.6%) had elevated HbA 1c only, and 169 (29.9%) had both abnormalities.

### Recent applications of machine learning and deep learning models in the prediction, diagnosis, and management of diabetes: a comprehensive review [^45fb8360]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2022). Medium credibility.

T2DM is the most common type of diabetes so that it develops in more than 90% of all cases. The main reason for developing T2DM is the impaired secretion of insulin by pancreatic β‑cells, generally because of insulin resistance in adipose tissue 1 (BOX 1), liver, skeletal muscle, and liver.

Prediabetes occurs before hyperglycemia, which is a high-risk situation that predisposes subjects to the development of T2DM. Prediabetes can be determined by one of the following conditions: elevated glycated Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels, Impaired Fasting Glucose (IFG) levels, and Impaired Glucose Tolerance (IGT). Cases with IFG levels are specified by Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG) measures greater than normal. IGT is characterized by impaired late insulin secretion after a meal and insulin resistance in muscles. People with prediabetes have HbA1c amounts between 5.7 and 6.4%. The rates of annual conversion of prediabetes to T2DM are from 3 to 11% per year.

T2DM is heritable and the probable risk of getting T2DM is higher among siblings of a T2DM patient than in families without any T2DM patient. The risk of getting T2DM is higher when the mother has this disease in comparison with when the father has it. Also, the risk of T2DM is noticeably elevated with a non‑normal fasting glucose concentration of > 5.5 mmol.l –1 or a body mass index (BMI) of ≥ 30. The genetic studies revealed a Single‑Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) in TCF7L2, CDKAL1, SLC30A8, CDKN2A, FTO, HHEX, CDKN2B, GCKR, IGF2BP2, and many others in T2DM cases. However, these genetic variants only elevate the risk by 10–20%. T2DM detection can be assessed based on FPG levels, increased plasma glucose test, 2‑hour post‑glucose‑load glucose level, or HbA1c. Moreover, there is a linear correlation between cardiovascular disease and glycemia with no obvious threshold. The risk of developing distal symmetric peripheral polyneuropathy and diabetic nephropathy is raised with hyperglycemia lower than those accompanied by diabetic retinopathy.

### Limited overlap between intermediate hyperglycemia as defined by A1c 5.7–6.4%, impaired fasting glucose, and impaired glucose tolerance [^073d8f26]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

We compared the prevalences and overlap between intermediate hyperglycemia (IH), defined by a hemoglobin A(1c) (A1C) 5.7–6.4%, impaired fasting glucose (IFG), and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT).

Research Design and Methods

Oral glucose tolerance test results and A1C measurements were evaluated as markers of IH in an unselected cohort of 486 nondiabetic adults from Finland.

Results

The overall prevalence of IH was 34%. Prevalences of isolated A1C 5.7–6.4%, IGT, and IFG were 8.0, 13.2, and 4.5%, respectively. Overlap between these three markers was uncommon. Isolated A1C 5.7–6.4% was associated with a higher BMI compared with isolated IFG and IGT and with a more adverse lipid profile compared with isolated IFG.

Conclusions

Prevalence of isolated IH was high, with limited overlap between the definitions. Differences in cardiovascular disease risk factors were observed among the groups. This study demonstrates that an A1C of 5.7–6.4% detects, in part, different individuals with IH compared with IFG and IGT.

### Baseline fasting glucose level, age, sex, and body mass index and the development of diabetes in US adults [^7e6462f4]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

With regard to choice of diagnostic test, measuring the FPG level has the advantage of being widely available and inexpensive, but the associated fasting requirement is burdensome, and the test is associated with significant biological variation. There is an increasing move toward the use of HbA 1c level, or a combination of FPG level and HbA 1c level for diagnosis of diabetes. Using the HbA 1c level overcomes many of the disadvantages of using the FPG level, but it is more expensive, not as widely available, and may be influenced by factors other than glucose, including race and ethnicity and change in erythrocyte life span. Discriminating based on FPG level vs HbA 1c level will detect different populations, and these tests individually and combined are less sensitive and specific than the criterion standard oral glucose tolerance test. In a study using data from 117 worldwide studies, 29% participants with screening-detected diabetes had elevated FPG levels, 37% had isolated elevated HbA 1c levels, and 31% had an elevation in both parameters. However, 55% of those with screening-detected diabetes in central and eastern Europe and 45% in high-income Western regions had isolated abnormal FPG levels. Both abnormal FPG and HbA 1c levels are associated with increased risk of macrovascular and microvascular disease, and there are effective approaches for delaying type 2 diabetes across both categories, with more intensive approaches advised for those at highest risk. Based on this evidence, by relying on serial FPG measurements, we will have missed some individuals with diabetes in our cohort and possibly overestimated diabetes among individuals who erroneously did not fast for the test. However, our approach was in keeping with prior studies, and congruent with our study population demographics and the overall practice across REP clinical sites throughout the study period.

### Primary prevention of ASCVD and T2DM in patients at metabolic risk: an endocrine society* clinical practice guideline [^aef9b564]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). High credibility.

Glycemic tests for identifying elevated glycemia — Fasting plasma glucose (FPG), 2-hour plasma glucose after a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), and/or HbA1c can be used; the FPG test is automated and inexpensive but reflects only a single time point, the OGTT is more sensitive but more time-consuming, costly, and variable than FPG, and some evidence suggests the OGTT is a better predictor for cardiovascular and all-cause mortality than FPG. HbA1c is a more long-term measure of glycemia with less sensitivity and less variability than glucose tests and can be performed in the nonfasting state; marked discrepancies between HbA1c and plasma glucose may indicate Hb variant assay interference, for which an assay without analytic interference should be used. In conditions with increased red blood cell turnover (e.g., sickle cell disease or hemodialysis), plasma blood glucose criteria should be used to diagnose diabetes; emerging data suggest that genetic variants such as glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency can significantly impact HbA1c levels. There is a strong, continuous association between HbA1c and subsequent diabetes risk, and within the HbA1c spectrum of prediabetes the yearly incidence of diabetes increases from ~3% with an HbA1c of 5.7% to ~9.5% with an HbA1c of 6.5%.

Definitions of prediabetes (intermediate glycemia) — Table 3 specifies organizational thresholds. For ADA, impaired fasting glucose (IFG) is 100–125 mg/dL (5.6–6.9 mmol/L), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT; 2-h OGTT) is 140–199 mg/dL (7.8–11.0 mmol/L), and high risk by A1c is 5.7%–6.4% (39–46 mmol/mol), with the comment that "Any one of the three is sufficient". For WHO 2011, IFG is 110–125 mg/dL (6.1–6.9 mmol/L) and "A1c is not recommended for diagnosis of intermediate glycemia". For IEC 2009, high risk by A1c is 6.0%–6.4% (42–46 mmol/mol) and the comment states "Restricted to higher risk group than ADA definition for T2DM prevention".

### Elevation of fasting morning glucose relative to hemoglobin A1c in normoglycemic patients treated with niacin and with statins [^ab6c6dcd]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Niacin increases fasting glucose levels, and statins modestly increase the rate of new-onset diabetes. The clinical importance and mechanisms of these effects are not fully explored.

Objective

On the basis of anecdotal observations, we hypothesized that elevated morning fasting glucose may be accompanied by relatively normal hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) in patients treated with niacin and other lipid-modifying drugs. We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis to test this hypothesis.

Methods

The Duke Lipid Clinic database (1994–2007) was screened for simultaneous determinations of fasting morning glucose and HbA1c, yielding 1483 data pairs among 554 subjects. Subjects with diabetes, by clinical diagnosis, medication, or any HbA1c ≥ 6.5%, or nondiabetes were analyzed separately. Repeated-measures linear regression featured glucose as dependent variable and included terms for HbA1c, drug(s), and their interaction.

Results

Regression lines for glucose on HbA1c had altered slopes in the presence of niacin and/or statin use in normoglycemic subjects. The corresponding interaction terms (drug and HbA1c) were significant (niacin P = 0.026, statin P = 0.013). Fibrate use had no effect (interaction P = 0.49). When modeled together, niacin and statin effects were independent. Regression curves in diabetic patients were not affected by lipid medications.

Conclusion

Elevated fasting glucose may be accompanied by relatively normal HbA1c in niacin- and statin-treated patients. HbA1c reflects average daily glucose levels and is likely a better measure of the glycemic effect of lipid medications. Because our data were retrospective, confirmation from randomized trials is needed.

### Elevated A1c in adults without a history of diabetes in the U.S [^e5f46fad]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Statistical analysis

Analyses were performed incorporating the sampling weights (8-year combined weights) to obtain unbiased estimates from the complex NHANES sampling design using StataSE (version 10.0; StataCorporation, College Station, TX) and R (version 2; Free Software Foundation, Boston, MA). SEs for all estimates were obtained using the Taylor series (linearization) method following NCHS-recommended procedures. Analyses of FPG categories were limited to the morning plasma glucose sample and corresponding 8-year fasting subsample weights were used for these analyses. We generated weighted and smoothed histograms (kernel density estimator) to compare the distribution of A1C in individuals with normal fasting glucose, IFG, and undiagnosed diabetes.

For the purposes of this study, we defined "elevated A1C" as A1C > 6% in this population without a history of diabetes. However, we also assessed the prevalence of elevated A1C at cut points of 6.0, 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, 6.6, 6.7, 6.8, 6.9, and ≥ 7.0%. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and their corresponding 95% CIs were estimated from logistic regression models to assess the association between potential risk factors and elevated A1C levels. We conducted multivariable logistic analyses modeling A1C > 6% as the outcome in the overall population. In the population of adults with normal A1C (< 6%) and normal fasting glucose (< 100 mg/dl) levels, we modeled the association between risk factors of interest and A1C level above the weighted median A1C level in this population (> 5.2%). Model 1 included age, sex, and race/ethnicity. Model 2 included all variables in model 1 plus hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, BMI, education, history of cardiovascular disease, alcohol consumption, and C-reactive protein categories. Sensitivity analyses were conducting using the OGTT data only available in NHANES 2005–2006 and the appropriate 2-year fasting weights for this survey.

Estimates from this study are nationally representative of the noninstitutionalized population of adults ≥ 20 years in the U.S. Prevalence estimates were applied to the 2000 U.S. Census to obtain estimates of the number of nondiabetic individuals with elevated A1C in the U.S. in the year 2000.

### Pitfalls of HbA1c in the diagnosis of diabetes [^c82732ed]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Many health care providers screen high-risk individuals exclusively with an HbA1c despite its insensitivity for detecting dysglycemia. The 2 cases presented describe the inherent caveats of interpreting HbA1c without performing an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). The first case reflects the risk of overdiagnosing type 2 diabetes (T2D) in an older African American male in whom HbA1c levels, although variable, were primarily in the mid-prediabetes range (5.7–6.4% [39–46 mmol/mol]) for many years although the initial OGTT demonstrated borderline impaired fasting glucose with a fasting plasma glucose of 102 mg/dL [5.7 mmol/L]) without evidence for impaired glucose tolerance (2-hour glucose ≥ 140–199 mg/dl ([7.8–11.1 mmol/L]). Because subsequent HbA1c levels were diagnostic of T2D (6.5%-6.6% [48–49 mmol/mol]), a second OGTT performed was normal. The second case illustrates the risk of underdiagnosing T2D in a male with HIV having normal HbA1c levels over many years who underwent an OGTT when mild prediabetes (HbA1c = 5.7% [39 mmol/mol]) developed that was diagnostic of T2D. To avoid inadvertent mistreatment, it is therefore essential to perform an OGTT, despite its limitations, in high-risk individuals, particularly when glucose or fructosamine and HbA1c values are discordant. Innate differences in the relationship between fructosamine or fasting glucose to HbA1c are demonstrated by the glycation gap or hemoglobin glycation index.

### Elevated HbA1c and fasting plasma glucose in predicting diabetes incidence among older adults: are two better than one? [^deade525]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Few data on the actual incidence of new-onset diabetes in elderly individuals exist in the prior literature. In our study of older adults, 10.8% of participants developed diabetes over 7 years (roughly approximating an annual incidence of ∼1.5% per year), which is similar to the annual incidence of diabetes among persons ≥ 65 years old in the U.S. (1.5% in 2011, according to the Centers for Disease Control estimates). The effect of elevated HbA 1c and IFG on the odds of diabetes was comparable in our study with the effect observed in younger populations, although elevated HbA 1c appeared to be a stronger predictor in our study. Proportions of Health ABC participants who developed diabetes over 7 years were 10.6, 21.3, 47.9, and 3.4% in those with IFG alone, elevated HbA 1c alone, both IFG and elevated HbA 1c, and normal parameters at baseline, respectively (compared with the incidence of diabetes over 5 years of 8.5, 7.3, 37.6, and 1.1%, respectively, in the Japanese study) (mean age of 49.9 years).

The ADA guidelines recommend the use of either test, HbA 1c or FPG, to identify individuals at risk for diabetes. Another option is to measure both tests, either simultaneously or in sequence, but this strategy is more costly. Several investigators have specifically evaluated whether obtaining two tests is better than either one alone in predominantly younger populations. In studies conducted in Japan and China, the ability to predict diabetes with both FPG and HbA 1c was significantly better than with either one alone. In a U.S. study, the incidence of diabetes was substantially increased in those with elevated FPG and HbA 1c compared with those with only one elevated test, but more detailed analyses of combined testing were not performed.

In the Health ABC study, over 7 years, diabetes developed in roughly one of four participants with IFG and one of three participants with elevated HbA 1c — when only one of these tests was considered. When both tests were considered together, the probability of diabetes was only 1–2 in 10 for participants with one elevated value (HbA 1c or FPG) and close to 1 in 2 for those with both elevated values. Interestingly, when the WHO definition of IFG was applied (FPG 110 to < 126 mg/dL), participants with this type of IFG had a similar 1 in 2 probability of developing diabetes over time.

### Clinical practice guidelines for the care of girls and women with Turner syndrome [^520cafa6]. Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

Turner syndrome (TS) — diabetes mellitus risk and screening: Diabetes mellitus is common in TS, with studies reporting a 25%-70% lifetime prevalence, and individuals with TS are at an increased risk for both type 1 and type 2 diabetes; fasting glucose and hemoglobin A1c can be normal even in the setting of impaired glucose tolerance in individuals with TS, and some authors suggest that oral glucose tolerance testing (OGTT) may be a better screening test for diabetes in TS, while there are no TS-specific intervention studies to inform the best treatment modalities for diabetes (insulin, GLP-1 agonist, oral agents, etc.).

### Diagnosis and classification of diabetes: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^989dcb64]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Table 2.4 — Staging of type 1 diabetes defines three stages by autoimmunity and glycemia. Stage 1 includes autoimmunity with normoglycemia and is presymptomatic, with multiple islet autoantibodies and no impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) or impaired fasting glucose (IFG), normal A1C. Stage 2 includes autoimmunity with dysglycemia and is presymptomatic; diagnostic criteria include islet autoantibodies (usually multiple) plus dysglycemia defined by IFG: FPG 100–125 mg/dL (5.6–6.9 mmol/L), or IGT: 2-h PG 140–199 mg/dL (7.8–11.0 mmol/L), or A1C 5.7–6.4% (39–47 mmol/mol) or ≥ 10% increase in A1C. Stage 3 includes autoimmunity with overt hyperglycemia and symptomatic disease; diagnostic criteria are diabetes by standard criteria, and autoantibodies may become absent. Alternate additional stage 2 criteria used in trials are 30-, 60-, or 90-min plasma glucose on oral glucose tolerance test ≥ 200 mg/dL (≥ 11.1 mmol/L) with confirmatory testing in those aged ≥ 18 years; dysglycemia can be defined by one or more criteria.

### Screening for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^5ec8d461]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF screening tests and diagnostic thresholds state that prediabetes and type 2 diabetes can be detected by fasting plasma glucose, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), or an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Type 2 diabetes is consistent with a fasting plasma glucose level of 126 mg/dL (6.99 mmol/L) or greater, an HbA1c level of 6.5% or greater, or a 2-hour postload glucose level of 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) or greater; prediabetes is consistent with a fasting plasma glucose level of 100 to 125 mg/dL (5.55–6.94 mmol/L), an HbA1c level of 5.7% to 6.4%, or a 2-hour postload glucose level of 140 to 199 mg/dL (7.77–11.04 mmol/L). Because HbA1c measurements do not require fasting, they are more convenient than using a fasting plasma glucose level or an OGTT; the OGTT is performed fasting and measures blood glucose 2 hours after a 75-g oral glucose load, and the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes should be confirmed with repeat testing before starting interventions.

### Prediabetes and cardiovascular disease: pathophysiology and interventions for prevention and risk reduction [^3f7bf891]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Prediabetes is a state characterized by impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose tolerance. This review discusses the pathophysiology and macrovascular complications of prediabetes. The pathophysiologic defects underlying prediabetes include insulin resistance, alpha- and beta-cell dysfunction, increased lipolysis, inflammation, and suboptimal incretin effect. Recent studies have revealed that the long-term complications of diabetes manifest in some people with prediabetes; these complications include microvascular and macrovascular disorders. Finally, we present an overview of randomized control trials aimed at preventing progression from prediabetes to type 2 diabetes and discuss their implications for macrovascular risk reduction.

### Multi-dimensional characterization of prediabetes in the project baseline health study [^10ac1f31]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Prediabetes affects over one-third of the United States (U.S.) population and is associated with an increased risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD) and higher health care utilization and costs. However, prediabetes encompasses a wide range of abnormalities in glycemia, including impaired fasting glucose, impaired glucose tolerance, and impaired/elevated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), as well as a wide range of clinical, chemical, molecular, and pathophysiological abnormalities that are associated with varied risks of progression to more severe and clinically identifiable diabetes and CVD. Identification of the abnormalities associated with the different states of glycemia (normal glucose control, prediabetes, and diabetes) in the general U.S. population may help identify causal pathways of development and progression to more severe disease states. Additionally, identification of abnormalities associated with 'high-risk' prediabetes, or characteristics associated with a higher risk of progression to diabetes/CVD and complications, based on clinical, chemical, molecular, and pathophysiological data would allow for more targeted and effective preventive interventions.

The Project Baseline Health Study (PBHS) (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03154346) is a unique, multicenter, prospective cohort harnessing advanced technological and digital capabilities for recruitment and data collection. The PBHS study performed deep phenotyping at in-person study visits, including medical history, physical function measures, imaging and biospecimen collection, as well as longitudinal digital health data, survey data, and annual follow-up. While prediabetes has been characterized through traditional cohort studies, in this study, we characterized participants with prediabetes compared with participants who had normal glycemic control or diabetes using the diverse and novel measures collected in the PBHS study. In addition, we identified biomarkers associated with progression from prediabetes to diabetes as well as reversion from prediabetes to normal glycemic control.

### Elevated HbA1c and fasting plasma glucose in predicting diabetes incidence among older adults: are two better than one? [^bcf7464e]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Impaired fasting glucose (IFG) (100–125 mg/dL) has been traditionally used for identifying persons at high risk for the subsequent development of diabetes in the U.S. Recent guidelines have additionally endorsed the use of HbA 1c 5.7–6.4% to identify those at risk. However, multiple studies, including one conducted among older persons, suggest that HbA 1c may identify different individuals at risk for diabetes than traditional glucose measures. Although several recent investigations confirm that HbA 1c is strongly predictive of future diabetes in predominantly middle-aged populations, less is known about how well HbA 1c identifies older persons at risk for diabetes.

Despite the high prevalence of type 2 diabetes in the elderly (10.9 million Americans in 2010) and the high incidence (390,000 new cases in 2010) of late-onset type 2 diabetes (> 65 years), there are few specific studies on prediction of diabetes in this group. One such study, based on an earlier Health, Aging, and Body Composition (Health ABC) analysis, developed a prediction rule for diabetes development, which included several factors: advanced age, female sex, elevated fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and triglyceride levels. However, HbA 1c was not examined as a potential predictor. In the Cardiovascular Health Study of men and women ≥ 65 years of age, BMI, waist-to-hip ratio, and weight gain were associated with a higher risk of diabetes, but the impact of glycemic measures on diabetes was not specifically examined. An Italian study of older adults (age 65–84 years) found that the combination of abnormal FPG (defined using World Health Organization [WHO] criteria: 110 to < 126 mg/dL), increased waist circumference, and HbA 1c ≥ 7.0% increased the probability of incident diabetes roughly 14-fold. However, neither a direct comparison of current prediabetes categories (based upon FPG and HbA 1c) for prediction of diabetes nor an analysis of the utility of combined testing has previously been conducted in this population.

We therefore evaluated the odds for diabetes based upon baseline IFG and elevated HbA 1c among the participants of the longitudinal Health ABC study. We directly compared FPG- and HbA 1c -based criteria for predicting the eventual development of diabetes, and we evaluated the utility of combined testing for identifying older persons who develop diabetes. Since HbA 1c values are consistently higher in blacks compared with whites, we additionally explored race differences in diabetes prediction.

### ADA updates standards of medical care for patients with… [^cb2fc1a7]. AAFP (2017). Low credibility.

- Aspirin therapy should be considered for women with diabetes who are 50 years and older.
- The addition of ezetimibe to statin therapy should be considered for eligible patients who can tolerate only a moderate-dose statin From the AFP Editors. In the 2016 update, the ADA revised the order and discussion of diagnostic tests to make it clear that no one test is preferred over others. Diabetes may be diagnosed based on results of random plasma glucose testing, fasting plasma glucose testing, two-hour 75-g oral glucose tolerance testing, or an A1C level of 6. 5% or greater. Studies have confirmed that, compared with fasting plasma glucose and A1C testing, two-hour OGTT diagnoses more persons with diabetes.

A1C testing has several advantages compared with fasting plasma glucose testing and OGTT, including greater convenience, greater preanalytical stability, and less day-to-day variation during stress and illness. However, these advantages may be offset by the lower sensitivity of A1C testing at the designated cutoff, greater cost, limited availability in certain regions, and the imperfect correlation between A1C and average glucose levels in certain persons. Continuous Glucose Monitoring Two primary techniques are available for clinicians and patients to assess glycemic control: patient self-monitoring of blood glucose levels and A1C. Continuous glucose monitoring may be a useful adjunct to self-monitoring in select patients. Real-time continuous glucose monitoring devices measure interstitial glucose levels and include alarms for hypo- and hyperglycemia. However, the U. S.

Food and Drug Administration has not approved these devices as a sole agent to monitor glucose levels. A meta-analysis suggests that, compared with patient self-monitoring, continuous glucose monitoring is associated with short-term A1C lowering of approximately 0. 26%. This technology may be particularly useful in patients who are not aware of hypoglycemia or who have frequent hypoglycemic episodes, and may reduce severe hypoglycemia in patients with a history of nocturnal hypoglycemia. Because of the growing number of older adults with insulin-dependent diabetes, the ADA now recommends that persons who use continuous glucose monitoring and insulin pumps should have continued access after 65 years of age.

### Diagnosis and classification of diabetes: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^83e42e55]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Diabetes diagnosis — confirmatory testing and discordance management: Unless there is a clear clinical diagnosis with random plasma glucose ≥ 200 mg/dL [≥ 11.1 mmol/L], diagnosis requires confirmation by two abnormal screening test results obtained at the same time or at two different time points. If using samples at two different time points, it is recommended that the second test, which may be either a repeat of the initial test or a different test, be performed in a timely manner; for example, if the A1C is 7.0% (53 mmol/mol) and a repeat result is 6.8% (51 mmol/mol), diabetes is confirmed. Two different tests (such as A1C and fasting plasma glucose [FPG]) both above the diagnostic threshold when collected at the same time or at two different time points also confirm the diagnosis. If results from two different tests are discordant, the test result that is above the diagnostic cut point should be repeated, and the diagnosis is made based on the confirmatory screening test; for instance, if A1C shows two results ≥ 6.5% [= 48 mmol/mol] but FPG is < 126 mg/dL [< 7.0 mmol/L], the person should nevertheless be considered to have diabetes. If abnormal A1C and FPG results are near diagnostic margins, repeat the test in 3–6 months, and substantial discordance between glucose values and A1C should prompt additional follow-up and consideration of other biomarkers such as fructosamine and glycated albumin for monitoring glycemic management.

### The pros and cons of diagnosing diabetes with A1c [^9aaccc73]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Standardization of A1C assay is very poor and standardization of glucose assay is easier to implement

Inaccuracies in measurement and poor standardization of A1C assays are still a common problem, even in Western countries. Although a less than perfect standardization also exists for plasma glucose, this assay might be more easily aligned to a standard than A1C. Such programs now exist in the U.S. Japan, and Sweden, but there is still a long way to a global standardization of the A1C assays. Actually, all glycemic assessments require confirmation to make the diagnosis of diabetes correctly, mainly to avoid errors in sample handling and laboratory procedures.

A1C assay is unreliable and cannot be used in many subjects

Abnormal hemoglobin traits are not uncommon in many regions of the world, and they significantly interfere with A1C assay, leading to spurious results. Also, there are several clinical conditions that influence erythrocyte turnover (e.g. malaria, chronic anemia, major blood loss, hemolysis, uremia, pregnancy, smoking, and various infections) that are responsible for misleading A1C data. Still, we are aware of ethnic differences in the relation between blood glucose and A1C levels as well as an effect of aging. If different cut points regarding all these conditions need to be considered, A1C cannot be easily used to diagnose diabetes.

Within-day biological variability of plasma glucose might unveil disturbance of glucose metabolism

Biological variability in plasma glucose reflects our daily patterns of diet, physical and mental activity, sleep, etc. and also depends on possible pathophysiological processes that may underlie type 2 diabetes. By definition, postprandial, and also 2-h PG, vary more than FPG. In this regard, A1C, which does not have any substantial biological variability, provides little information on pathophysiological processes leading to type 2 diabetes. The variability in A1C is entirely due to other phenomena, not pathophysiological disturbances.

### American association of clinical endocrinology clinical practice guideline: developing a diabetes mellitus comprehensive care plan-2022 update [^f9682708]. Endocrine Practice (2022). High credibility.

Prediabetes — recommendation 11.6 and diagnostic thresholds: Diabetes medications including metformin, acarbose, pioglitazone, or glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) can be considered in persons with prediabetes or in those with adiposity-based chronic disease (ABCD) who remain glucose-intolerant after weight loss using lifestyle and/or weight-loss medications (Grade A; BEL 1). Prediabetes can be identified by impaired fasting glucose (fasting plasma glucose 100 to 125 mg/dL), impaired glucose tolerance (oral glucose tolerance test result 140 to 199 mg/dL, 2 hours after ingesting 75 g of glucose), or A1C 5.7% to 6.4%, and progression risk is greatest with a history of gestational diabetes mellitus, strong family history of type 2 diabetes, progressive glycemia within the prediabetes range, or meeting a combination of impaired fasting glucose, impaired glucose tolerance, or metabolic syndrome criteria (any 2 out of 3).

### Prediabetes: a worldwide epidemic [^8e802d9f]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Prediabetes, defined by blood glucose levels between normal and diabetic levels, is increasing rapidly worldwide. This abnormal physiologic state reflects the rapidly changing access to high-calorie food and decreasing levels of physical activity occurring worldwide, with resultant obesity and metabolic consequences. This is particularly marked in developing countries. Prediabetes poses several threats; there is increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and there are risks inherent to the prediabetes state, including microvascular and macrovascular disease. Studies have helped to elucidate the underlying pathophysiology of prediabetes and to establish the potential for treating prediabetes and preventing T2DM.

### Impact of A1c screening criterion on the diagnosis of pre-diabetes among U.S. adults [^d4df9430]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

It is important to recognize that either criterion (fasting glucose or A1C) is a diagnostic test, not a traditional screening test in that it is not compared with a true criterion standard. Astute clinicians may recognize the shortcomings of each test; however, many providers will probably choose only one or the other for use in practice. The clinical guidelines do not comment on the need for follow-up testing for pre-diabetes. This situation increases the likelihood of higher degrees of variation in screening practices with a possibility of more confusion among providers and patients. Educational interventions may need to be developed to help primary care providers and patients understand the advantages and shortcomings of each test used alone or in combination.

Pre-diabetes is a label developed to identify those at highest risk for incident diabetes in the near future. Data from observational studies suggest that 25–40% of individuals with pre-diabetes will develop diabetes over the next 3–8 years. Guidelines suggest targeting individuals identified as having pre-diabetes for early interventions. Currently, the most effective intervention for the prevention or delay of diabetes is intensive lifestyle behavior change with metformin therapy a less potent alternative. Whereas intensive lifestyle interventions are recommended for individuals identified via IFG, A1C, or IGT, current guidelines recommend that metformin be reserved for those with both combined IFG and IGT plus other risk factors such as A1C > 6%, hypertension, low HDL cholesterol, elevated triglycerides, or a family history of diabetes in a first-degree relative who are obese and aged > 60 years. This recommendation has led some investigators to call for follow-up IGT testing in all individuals identified as having pre-diabetes based on their fasting glucose. This is in part due to the observation that the odds for incident diabetes are fourfold higher among individuals with both IFG and IGT than either alone (odds ratio 39.5 vs. 10.0 and 10.9, respectively). With the use of A1C as a legitimate alternative diagnostic criterion for pre-diabetes, the need for a follow-up OGTT before prescribing metformin may become a point of contention. If an OGTT is not performed, combined criteria of A1C with follow-up IFG testing could be used because this group would also be very high risk, and the data could be combined with other metabolic abnormalities using one of the established diabetes risk calculators to generate a more precise risk estimate. Which criterion is more accurate and clinically relevant for predicting diabetes and tailoring interventions will need to be examined in future prospective studies.

### Cardiometabolic risk profiles and carotid atherosclerosis in individuals with prediabetes identified by fasting glucose, postchallenge glucose, and hemoglobin A1c criteria [^9c2eb493]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Hemoglobin A 1c (A1C) is an integrated measure of average blood glucose concentrations over the preceding 2–3 months and is widely used for monitoring metabolic control in individuals with diabetes. Recently, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) has revised criteria for the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes and the categories at increased risk for diabetes already including impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) on the basis of an ample analysis performed by an international expert committee recommending the use of A1C measurements as another diagnostic test option in addition to glucose values. Specifically for the categories of increased risk for type 2 diabetes, the new ADA recommendations state that an A1C from 5.7 to 6.4% identifies individuals at high risk for diabetes to whom the term prediabetes may be applied.

A1C measurements offer some practical advantages over assessments of fasting plasma glucose (FPG) or glucose levels during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), including lower day-to-day variability, less perturbations during periods of stress or illness, and requirement of a nonfasting sample. However, the A1C measure may identify distinct subjects at increased risk for type 2 diabetes compared with IFG and IGT, and if extensively implemented, may to some extent change the present epidemiologic setting of these dysglycemic conditions. Although it would be desirable for fasting glucose, 2-h postchallenge glucose, and A1C values to be equivalent in identifying at-risk subjects, a poor concordance among the three prediabetes categories has been reported in different ethnic groups.

### Use of high-normal levels of haemoglobin A (1C) and fasting plasma glucose for diabetes screening and for prediction: a meta-analysis [^c9b05ff8]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Using high-normal levels of haemoglobin A1C (Abnormal-A1C) or fasting plasma glucose (FPG) (Abnormal-FPG) for diabetes screening are expected to improve the ability to detect persons with or at high risk of diabetes. We assessed the diagnostic and predictive capacity for diabetes of Abnormal-A1C and Abnormal-FPG. We compared these to the combined use of the two measures to the single use of either measurement.

Methods

We analysed 31 eligible cross-sectional or cohort studies that assessed diagnostic or predictive ability, respectively, by using lower A1C and FPG cutoff values than recommended by current diabetes criteria. Positive and negative likelihood ratios (LR+ and LR-) were calculated to assess the ability to confirm or exclude diabetes, respectively, on the basis of a bivariate random-effects model.

Results

With both Abnormal-A1C and Abnormal-FPG, the pooled LR+ was above 4 for diagnosing diabetes and above 3 for predicting diabetes. However, the pooled LR- for predicting diabetes was higher with Abnormal-A1C (0.48) and Abnormal-FPG (0.49) in comparison with that for diagnosing diabetes (0.27, Abnormal-A1C; 0.28, Abnormal-FPG). In eight studies that assessed the predictive ability of the combination of A1C and FPG, using either Abnormal-A1C or Abnormal-FPG could lower LR- to 0.17 from 0.43 for only Abnormal-A1C and from 0.38 for only Abnormal-FPG. Accordingly, LR+ was also lowered to 2.37 from 3.36 for only Abnormal-A1C and from 3.84 for only-Abnormal-FPG.

Conclusion

The use of the two blood glucose tests had insufficient capacity to identify subjects at high risk for diabetes but had considerable capacity to identify undiagnosed diabetes.

### Prevalence of diabetes and high risk for diabetes using A1c criteria in the U.S. population in 1988–2006 [^012cebb4]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

The A1C test has recently been recommended for diagnosing diabetes, based on a detailed analysis of its attributes by an international expert committee. Laboratory-measured A1C is now as accurate and precise as glucose assays due to improvements in instrumentation and standardization. A1C samples can be obtained at any time, require no patient preparation, and are relatively stable at room temperature after collection. A1C has substantially less biologic variability and is unaffected by acute effects of stress or illness. As a measure of long-term glycemic exposure, A1C has been shown to be better and more consistently correlated with retinopathy in the setting of observational studies and clinical trials in type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients, which have established widely accepted A1C treatment goals for diabetes. A cut point of ≥ 6.5% for the diagnosis of diabetes was recommended by the committee as optimal for detecting a level of retinopathy thought to be diabetes specific and not due to other conditions (e.g. hypertension). A limitation of A1C for diagnosis is that the committee could not define a specific intermediate threshold at which increased risk for diabetes clearly begins. While there is a continuum of risk even at values into the normal range, the committee suggested the range of ≥ 6.0 to < 6.5% to represent the highest risk for progression to diabetes and one at which preventive measures might be implemented, with additional consideration of prevention efforts at lower levels in the presence of other risk factors. The committee hoped that its report would serve as a stimulus to the scientific community and professional organizations for considering the A1C assay for diagnosis of diabetes.

A change in diagnostic criteria has important public health implications pertaining to the magnitude of the population with diabetes or at high risk of diabetes. This report examines the prevalence of diagnosed and undiagnosed diabetes and high risk of diabetes based on self-report and A1C criteria in the U.S. population during 2003–2006. Prevalences are compared with those using the A1C criteria in 1988–1994 and 1999–2002. Finally, we compare the concordance in prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes using the new A1C criteria to criteria based on fasting plasma glucose and 2-h plasma glucose from an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT).

### Associations between features of glucose exposure and A1c: the A1c-derived average glucose (ADAG) study [^e474e6f3]. Diabetes (2010). Low credibility.

New treatment regimens and guidelines have increasingly focused on postprandial hyperglycemia as an additional target beyond average glucose control. However, direct evidence for an effect of specifically controlling postprandial glucose (PPG) and glucose excursions (over and above the effect of reducing average glucose levels on long-term diabetes complications) is limited. The current debate about whether postprandial hyperglycemia and excessive glucose variability are associated with an increased risk of diabetes complications is largely based on epidemiological studies. Many of these findings (,–) are based on an extrapolation of glucose levels 2 h after an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) as a model for the postprandial state rather than on "real-life" PPG measurements. Only a few studies have also measured the effect of A1C for comparison, and these show conflicting results.

Studies examining PPG control use various methods to quantify PPG, overall hyperglycemia, and glucose variability, without any standardization of methods. One approach to assess the role of PPG has been to examine the extent to which it contributes to overall glucose exposure, measured as A1C. Limited evidence suggests that postprandial glycemia is the dominant contributor to overall hyperglycemia in patients with good to moderate glycemic control (A1C < 8.5%), while fasting glucose levels represent the major contributor at higher A1C levels. These findings have been used to support the need to measure and treat PPG in order to reach clinical guideline levels of A1C. Measures of nocturnal glycemia are rarely used in the prediction of A1C. Available literature exploring the nocturnal glucose exposure is sparse and mostly focused on nocturnal hypoglycemia or assessment of glucose variability during glucose-lowering therapies.

Our aim was to examine the relationship among the most commonly used indexes of PPG, overall hyperglycemia, glucose variability, nocturnal glycemia, and A1C using glucose measures obtained during everyday activities from the A1C-Derived Average Glucose (ADAG) study. Additionally, we studied which blood glucose value(s) of the day provide the strongest prediction of mean blood glucose, as measured by A1C, especially focusing on pre- and postprandial glucose contributions to mean blood glucose levels.

### Evaluating the safety and efficacy of sodium-glucose Co-transporter 2 inhibitors in subjects with prediabetes: a protocol for a randomized controlled trial [^cd0e24ea]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Prediabetes is a state characterized by subclinical impairment in glycemic variables that falls between normal glucose tolerance and diabetes. Diagnostic criteria for prediabetes have evolved over time and vary across institutions. Prevalent definitions for prediabetes, proposed by the American Diabetes Association and the World Health Organization, encapsulate conditions such as impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), impaired fasting glucose (IFG), and a glycosylated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level fluctuating between 5.7% and 6.4%. The global prevalence of prediabetes is alarmingly high, with more than 30% of the population demonstrating one or more forms of prediabetic dysglycemia. Moreover, approximately 5–10% of people with impaired glucose regulation progress to diabetes annually, up to 70% of individuals with IFG and/or IGT go on to develop clinical type 2 diabetes at some time in the future, and the risk significantly increases with higher HbA1c levels or body mass index (BMI). Additionally, prediabetes is associated with dyslipidemia and microvascular dysfunction, and increases the risk and incidence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, cancer, and dementia. Given the escalating prevalence of prediabetes worldwide and its potential complications, identifying and treating individuals with prediabetes is of utmost importance. Recent evidence suggests that it is possible to prevent the progression from prediabetes to diabetes through lifestyle programs and metformin. It is necessary to evaluate whether other interventions are effective, thus providing more evidence for diabetes prevention.

### Type 2 diabetes mellitus in children and adolescents [^b45fafae]. Pediatrics in Review (2013). Low credibility.

On the basis of strong research evidence and consensus, type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM) remains the most common form of DM in children and adolescents. The incidence of type 2 DM in the pediatric population is rapidly increasing because of the obesity epidemic, and minority groups are disproportionately affected. (2) (10) (19) On the basis of some research evidence and consensus, it can be challenging to initially differentiate between type 2 DM and type 1 DM clinically because of the increased prevalence of obesity, the complex interplay of autoimmunity and obesity, and common symptoms at presentation. (1) (10) (19) Significant evidence and consensus support a genetic basis for the development of type 2 DM in children. Physicians should routinely screen at risk children older than age 10 years for DM. Screening criteria include obesity, a family history of type 2 DM, a minority racial or ethnic background, acanthosis nigricans, or other diseases associated with insulin resistance, including polycystic ovary syndrome, hypertension, or dyslipidemia. (1) (10) (18) (19) On the basis of consensus, diagnosis of type 2 DM can be confirmed by an elevated fasting blood glucose level greater than 126 mg/dl (7.0 mmol/L), an elevated 2-hour plasma glucose greater than 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) on an oral glucose tolerance test, an elevated random blood glucose greater than 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L), or a hemoglobin A1c level greater than 6.5% with suggestive symptoms. (10) According to strong research evidence and consensus, once the diagnosis has been made, treatment should be based on the acuity of presentation and should focus on lifestyle modification and on normalizing hyperglycemia to minimize complications. Metformin is currently first-line treatment for type 2 DM in children and adolescents older than age 10 years who present nonacutely. (18) (19) Strong research evidence and consensus demonstrate that because type 2 DM has an insidious onset, microvascular and macrovascular complications can be present at the time of diagnosis. Patients should be screened for the presence of complications when the diagnosis of type 2 DM is made and in follow-up. (6) (10).

### Should adults with prediabetes Be prescribed metformin to prevent… [^21aa2611]. AAFP (2019). Medium credibility.

The American Diabetes Association definition of prediabetes now includes a threshold value in fasting glucose, two-hour glucose tolerance test, or A1C. This definition dramatically expands the number of people who meet the definition of prediabetes; one-third of Americans older than 18 years meet the criteria. 2 In addition, many people will be mislabeled as having prediabetes. Compared with the reference standard of an oral glucose tolerance test, a single A1C measurement is 49% sensitive and 79% specific for prediabetes. 3 The ADA itself states that "prediabetes should not be viewed as a clinical entity in its own right but rather as an increased risk for diabetes and cardiovascular disease. " 1 Cutoff values for diabetes and prediabetes are arbitrary.

4 There is broad agreement that the first interventions for people with obesity, diabetes, or elevated blood glucose levels should be improving diet and exercise. A diagnosis is not needed to focus on these interventions to improve health and well-being. Studies of patients with borderline glucose values have shown a decreased incidence of crossing the threshold for a diabetes diagnosis with lifestyle intervention. 3 Those advocating for pharmacologic intervention for threshold glucose values cite randomized controlled trials that show a lower incidence of diabetes with metformin treatment. The landmark 2002 Diabetes Prevention Program studied metformin vs. placebo medication vs. a lifestyle modification program in patients without diabetes who had elevated fasting and postload plasma glucose levels. 5 This study showed a decreased incidence of diabetes at 2. 8 years. Using the ADA-defined threshold, 28. 9% in the placebo group,
21. 7% in the metformin group, and 14.

4% in the lifestyle group were diagnosed with diabetes at three years. At four years, the average A1C was 5. 9% in the metformin or lifestyle groups and
6. 1% in the placebo group. Although these surrogate outcome differences are statistically significant, they are not clinically meaningful. Treating borderline glucose values does not improve quality of life, mortality, or any other patient-oriented outcomes. 5, 6.

### Systematic literature review: should a bedtime snack be used to treat hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes? [^c1457d64]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Type 2 diabetes poses a significant and growing health risk. It is estimated that in 2019, ∼9.3% of the population or 463 million adults had diabetes worldwide with ∼90% of these cases being type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes is a well-documented risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, reducing life expectancy by 5–15 y. Without appropriate management, this can lead to uncontrolled blood glucose concentrations and an increased risk of complications such as blindness, amputation, and CVD. HbA1c is an important indicator of glycemic control over the preceding 2–3 mo, comprising contributions from both postprandial and fasting glucose concentrations. Findings from several cohort studies have demonstrated a 2-fold greater risk of CVD with high HbA1c or fasting glucose concentrations. Accordingly, targeting HbA1c < 53 mmol/mol (7.0%) and fasting glucose < 7.2 mmol/L remain the cornerstone of diabetes treatment in order to reduce the risk of the above-mentioned diabetes complications.

Fasting hyperglycemia is the term that describes elevated glucose concentrations upon waking after a nocturnal fast. In the morning, a cascade of gluconeogenic hormones are released as the body wakes, often causing a hyperglycemic event which if not regulated is known as the dawn phenomenon. Alternatively, another concept known as the Somogyi effect can occur, which describes the onset of hyperglycemia first induced by a hypoglycemic event that triggers high levels of gluconeogenesis to compensate for the dip in blood glucose. A potential strategy to reduce morning hyperglycemia is to consume a bedtime snack. Theoretically, ingestion of a snack before bedtime could mitigate fasting hyperglycemia by decreasing the nocturnal fasting window, reducing the gluconeogenic demands on the liver. Additionally, reducing the fasting window may elicit the second meal effect, which refers to the lasting impact a prior meal has on blood glucose concentrations following a subsequent meal. Furthermore, if ingestion of a bedtime snack results in fasting normoglycemia, overall glucose control and hence HbA1c could be improved.

### Child with suspected hyperglycemia [^8fcc3d4d]. PES (2020). High credibility.

Laboratory abnormalities — pre-diabetes is defined as fasting blood glucose: 100–125 mg/ dl, 2 hour post prandial glucose: 140–200 mg/dl after glucose load of 1 gm/kg (maximum dose: 75 gm) or HbA1c: 5.7–6.4%, while diabetes is defined as fasting blood glucose ≥ 126 mg/dl, 2 hour post prandial glucose ≥ 200 mg/dl after glucose load of 1 gm/ kg (maximum dose: 75 gm), HbA1c ≥ 6.5% or random blood glucose ≥ 200 mg/dl in patient with classic symptoms of hyperglycemia; in the absence of unequivocal hyperglycemia, result should be repeated.
