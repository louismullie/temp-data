## Question

Apixaban with fish oil interactions in patients with atrial fibrillation

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether fish oil (omega-3 fatty acids) interacts with apixaban in patients with atrial fibrillation, and if so, how to manage that interaction. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacology of apixaban and its known interaction profile. Then, I should verify the pharmacologic effects of fish oil on hemostasis and whether it meaningfully alters apixaban's mechanism. Next, I will check authoritative drug–drug interaction sources and clinical guidelines for any documented interaction. After that, I should review clinical trial and observational data for signals of increased bleeding when fish oil is combined with anticoagulants. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation and monitoring plan, including peri-procedural considerations and when to avoid or adjust therapy.

> Let me first confirm apixaban's pharmacology and interaction liabilities. Apixaban is a direct, selective factor Xa inhibitor with predictable pharmacokinetics, minimal dietary interactions, and relatively few clinically important drug–drug interactions compared with warfarin; clinically relevant interactions typically involve strong dual inhibitors of CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein, which can raise apixaban exposure and bleeding risk, prompting dose reduction or avoidance in some cases [^112j6s99] [^1138PCer] [^112UWwto].

> Now, I need to check the pharmacologic effects of fish oil. Omega-3 fatty acids (EPA/DHA) can modestly inhibit platelet aggregation and may prolong bleeding time, but they do not inhibit factor Xa or thrombin and do not meaningfully alter the coagulation cascade targeted by apixaban; importantly, any antiplatelet effect is generally mild and not equivalent to pharmacologic anticoagulation, so the theoretical concern is additive bleeding risk rather than a pharmacokinetic interaction with apixaban metabolism or transport [^114G3xCg] [^111WUSkN].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should verify whether authoritative sources list a specific interaction. A high-quality drug–drug interaction database (DrugBank) reports no interaction between apixaban and fish oil, which supports the absence of a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic clash. Additionally, contemporary AF guidelines emphasize management of CYP3A4/P-gp interactions with DOACs but do not list fish oil as an interacting agent, further suggesting no formal contraindication or mandated dose change when fish oil is used with apixaban [^112az2ha] [^112UWwto] [^1138PCer].

> Next, I should review clinical evidence for bleeding signals when fish oil is combined with anticoagulants. The FDA labeling for omega-3 products notes that some studies show prolongation of bleeding time with omega-3s and anticoagulants/antiplatelets, but the prolongation did not exceed normal limits and did not produce clinically significant bleeding episodes; a systematic review likewise found no consistent association between omega-3 dosing and bleeding, even with concomitant anticoagulants or antiplatelets at typical supplement doses, although caution is advised at higher doses and around procedures [^114G3xCg] [^111WUSkN].

> Wait, let me verify whether AF-specific data exist. I initially thought there might be AF-specific trials of apixaban plus fish oil, but I should double-check. I do not find randomized AF data specifically testing apixaban with fish oil, and the closest signals come from general anticoagulant cohorts and labeling language rather than AF-only studies, so extrapolation must be cautious and individualized [^notfound].

> I will now examine indirect but relevant data on bleeding with apixaban in polypharmacy and with antiplatelet agents to contextualize risk. In ARISTOTLE, concomitant aspirin increased bleeding on apixaban from 1.8% to 3.4% per year, and NSAID use was associated with higher bleeding risk; however, these reflect pharmacologically active antiplatelet or GI-mucosal effects rather than omega-3s, so they inform additive bleeding risk principles but are not direct evidence of an apixaban–fish oil interaction [^112DJNas] [^112jQ1QZ].

> Let me consider patient-level risk modifiers. Older age, low body weight, renal impairment, prior bleeding, and high HAS-BLED predict higher bleeding risk on anticoagulation; in such patients, even a modest antiplatelet effect from fish oil could theoretically tip the balance, so I should individualize counseling and monitoring rather than apply a blanket rule [^notfound].

> But wait, what if the patient is taking a prescription omega-3 ethyl ester (icosapent ethyl)? I should confirm that this is not the same as over-the-counter fish oil. Icosapent ethyl carries an FDA warning for increased bleeding when combined with antithrombotics and for increased atrial fibrillation/flutter hospitalizations, so if a patient is on icosapent ethyl rather than a standard supplement, the bleeding risk calculus and AF risk discussion are different and warrant closer monitoring and shared decision-making [^114Mwqzx] [^1141vdj6] [^1125bqQd].

> Next, I should review peri-procedural management. For elective procedures with moderate-to-high bleeding risk, it is reasonable to hold high-dose fish oil about 7 days pre-procedure given the potential to prolong bleeding time, then resume post-procedure once hemostasis is secure. This is consistent with expert guidance to pause omega-3s around invasive procedures, even though the evidence for clinically significant bleeding is limited at typical doses [^111WUSkN].

> I need to ensure practical monitoring is clear. No routine laboratory monitoring is required for apixaban, and standard coagulation tests are not reliable for DOAC effect; clinically, I would reinforce bleeding precautions, review all concomitant antiplatelet and NSAID use, and ask about bruising, epistaxis, hematuria, melena, or menorrhagia at follow-up, escalating evaluation if bleeding signs emerge or if fish oil dose is high or changed [^112j6s99].

> Let me synthesize the clinical recommendation. For most patients with AF taking apixaban, concomitant use of standard-dose fish oil supplements (about 1–2 g/day of combined EPA/DHA) appears safe without a need for apixaban dose adjustment, given no documented pharmacokinetic interaction and only mild, clinically inconsequential antiplatelet effects at typical doses. Counsel on additive bleeding risk, avoid high-dose regimens unless there is a compelling indication, and consider holding fish oil peri-procedurally, while maintaining vigilance for other, more impactful bleeding risks like NSAIDs or dual antiplatelet therapy [^112az2ha] [^114G3xCg] [^111WUSkN] [^112DJNas].

> Hold on, I should verify exceptions. If the patient is on prescription icosapent ethyl, has a high HAS-BLED score, is elderly with frailty, or is taking additional antithrombotics, I would favor a more conservative approach: use the lowest effective omega-3 dose, reassess necessity, and monitor more closely for bleeding. If bleeding occurs or risk escalates, discontinuation of fish oil is reasonable given the limited incremental benefit in AF and the potential for additive hemostatic effects [^114Mwqzx].

> In conclusion, after checking pharmacology, authoritative interaction sources, and available clinical data, there is no established clinically significant interaction between fish oil and apixaban, but a modest, additive antiplatelet effect is plausible. Therefore, routine co-administration is generally acceptable with standard counseling, with heightened caution in high-risk patients and around procedures, and with a clear distinction from prescription EPA formulations that carry different warnings [^112az2ha] [^114G3xCg] [^111WUSkN] [^114Mwqzx].

Apixaban and fish oil do not have a **clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction** [^notfound], but fish oil's mild antiplatelet effect may **additively increase bleeding risk** when combined with apixaban [^114G3xCg]. Routine co-administration is generally safe at typical doses (1–3 g/day) [^111WUSkN], but patients should be monitored for bruising, petechiae, or bleeding [^114xqpux], especially with high-dose fish oil or other bleeding risk factors [^111WUSkN]. No dose adjustment is required, but **caution is advised** in patients with high bleeding risk or before procedures; consider holding fish oil 1–2 weeks prior to surgery or invasive procedures [^notfound].

---

## Pharmacological mechanisms and potential interactions

### Apixaban

Apixaban is a **direct factor Xa inhibitor** [^112j6s99] that reduces thrombin generation and thrombus formation without directly affecting platelet aggregation. It has predictable pharmacokinetics, a low propensity for drug–drug interactions, and does not require routine laboratory monitoring [^114JLzB2].

---

### Fish oil (omega-3 fatty acids)

Fish oil contains **omega-3 fatty acids** (EPA and DHA) that have mild antiplatelet effects — reducing thromboxane A2 production and platelet aggregation — and may modestly prolong bleeding time [^114G3xCg]. At typical doses (1–3 g/day), clinically significant bleeding is uncommon [^111WUSkN].

---

### Potential interaction

There is **no direct pharmacokinetic interaction** between apixaban and fish oil [^notfound]; fish oil does not significantly affect CYP3A4 or P-glycoprotein, the main pathways of apixaban metabolism [^114esmVU]. The concern is a **pharmacodynamic interaction** — additive anticoagulant and antiplatelet effects that may increase bleeding risk, particularly at high fish oil doses or in patients with other bleeding risk factors [^114xqpux].

---

## Clinical evidence regarding bleeding risk

Clinical evidence on the **bleeding risk** of combining apixaban and fish oil is limited; no large randomized trials have specifically evaluated this combination. Available data suggest the following:

- **General omega-3 risk**: Omega-3 fatty acids can modestly prolong bleeding time, but clinically significant bleeding is rare at typical doses [^114G3xCg] [^111WUSkN].

- **Additive risk**: The main concern is additive bleeding risk when fish oil is combined with anticoagulants, especially at high doses or with other bleeding risk factors [^114xqpux].

- **Clinical experience**: Case reports and clinical experience suggest that the combination is generally well tolerated at standard doses, but caution is warranted in high-risk patients [^111WUSkN].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines do not specifically address the combination of apixaban and fish oil. General recommendations include:

- **Routine use**: Routine co-administration of fish oil with apixaban is generally considered safe at typical doses (1–3 g/day) [^112az2ha] [^111WUSkN].

- **Monitoring**: Patients should be monitored for signs of bleeding, such as easy bruising, petechiae, or unusual bleeding [^114xqpux].

- **High-risk patients**: Caution is advised in patients with high bleeding risk, those undergoing surgery, or those taking other medications that increase bleeding risk [^111WUSkN] [^112DJNas].

---

## Clinical scenarios requiring caution or dose adjustment

Certain clinical scenarios may warrant **additional caution** or consideration of dose adjustment:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| High-dose fish oil (> 3 g/day) | - Increased bleeding risk <br/> - Monitor closely or consider dose reduction [^114Mwqzx] |
| High bleeding risk (elderly, renal impairment, history of bleeding) | - Use caution <br/> - Monitor closely for bleeding [^notfound] |
| Upcoming surgery or invasive procedures | - Hold fish oil 1–2 weeks prior to procedure [^notfound] |
| Concomitant use of other anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents | - Increased bleeding risk <br/> - Monitor closely [^111ZrkZi] |

---

## Monitoring and management strategies

When combining apixaban and fish oil, clinicians should consider the following **monitoring and management strategies**:

- **Patient education**: Educate patients about signs of bleeding and when to seek medical attention [^notfound].

- **Regular follow-up**: Schedule regular follow-up visits to assess bleeding risk and adjust therapy as needed [^112FikNY].

- **Laboratory monitoring**: Routine laboratory monitoring is not required, but clinical vigilance for bleeding is essential [^114JLzB2].

---

## Summary of evidence and clinical implications

In summary, apixaban and fish oil do not have a **clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction** [^112az2ha], but fish oil's mild antiplatelet effect may **additively increase bleeding risk** when combined with apixaban [^114G3xCg]. Routine co-administration is generally safe at typical doses, but patients should be monitored for bleeding, especially with high-dose fish oil or other bleeding risk factors [^111WUSkN]. No dose adjustment is required, but caution is advised in high-risk patients or before procedures [^111WUSkN].

Warfarin interaction mitigation — The most effective method to avoid adverse outcomes associated with drug interactions is to try to avoid, when feasible, concurrent use of potentially interacting drugs and to use noninteracting alternatives instead; when noninteracting alternatives are not available, adverse outcomes can be avoided by increasing the frequency of monitoring and adjusting warfarin doses based on INR response, and prospective dosing adjustments are inappropriate because of the unpredictable nature of patient response to drug interactions.

### Polypharmacy and effects of apixaban versus warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation: post hoc analysis of the ARISTOTLE trial [^116FytTG]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To determine whether the treatment effect of apixaban versus warfarin differs with increasing numbers of concomitant drugs used by patients with atrial fibrillation.

Design

Post hoc analysis performed in 2015 of results from ARISTOTLE (apixaban for reduction in stroke and other thromboembolic events in atrial fibrillation)-a multicentre, double blind, double dummy trial that started in 2006 and ended in 2011.

Participants

18201 ARISTOTLE trial participants.

Interventions

In the ARISTOTLE trial, patients were randomised to either 5 mg apixaban twice daily (n = 9120) or warfarin (target international normalised ratio range 2.0–3.0; n = 9081). In the post hoc analysis, patients were divided into groups according to the number of concomitant drug treatments used at baseline (0–5, 6–8, ≥ 9 drugs) with a median follow-up of 1.8 years.

Main Outcome Measures

Clinical outcomes and treatment effects of apixaban versus warfarin (adjusted for age, sex, and country).

Results

Each patient used a median of six drugs (interquartile range 5–9); polypharmacy (≥ 5 drugs) was seen in 13932 (76.5%) patients. Greater numbers of concomitant drugs were used in older patients, women, and patients in the United States. The number of comorbidities increased across groups of increasing numbers of drugs (0–5, 6–8, ≥ 9 drugs), as did the proportions of patients treated with drugs that interact with warfarin or apixaban. Mortality also rose significantly with the number of drug treatments (P < 0.001), as did rates of stroke or systemic embolism (1.29, 1.48, and 1.57 per 100 patient years, for 0–5, 6–8, and ≥ 9 drugs, respectively) and major bleeding (1.91, 2.46, and 3.88 per 100 patient years, respectively). Relative risk reductions in stroke or systemic embolism for apixaban versus warfarin were consistent, regardless of the number of concomitant drugs (Pinteraction = 0.82). A smaller reduction in major bleeding was seen with apixaban versus warfarin with increasing numbers of concomitant drugs (Pinteraction = 0.017). Patients with interacting (potentiating) drugs for warfarin or apixaban had similar outcomes and consistent treatment effects of apixaban versus warfarin.

Conclusions

In the ARISTOTLE trial, three quarters of patients had polypharmacy; this subgroup had an increased comorbidity, more interacting drugs, increased mortality, and higher rates of thromboembolic and bleeding complications. In terms of a potential differential response to anticoagulation therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation and polypharmacy, apixaban was more effective than warfarin, and is at least just as safe.

Apixaban — pharmacology and interactions — Apixaban is an oral direct factor Xa inhibitor with an oral bioavailability of > 45%. In healthy men, plasma levels peak about 3 h after oral administration and clearance occurs with a terminal plasma half-life of 8 to 14 h. Elimination involves multiple pathways, including oxidative metabolism and renal and intestinal routes. Potent inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as ketoconazole or ritonavir, are contraindicated because they increase plasma drug concentrations.

### Fish oil interaction with warfarin [^11125jjq]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a case of elevated international normalized ratio (INR) in a patient taking fish oil and warfarin.

Case Summary

A 67-year-old white woman had been taking warfarin for 1(1/2) years due to recurrent transient ischemic attacks. Her medical history included hypothyroidism, hyperlipidemia, osteopenia, hypertension, and coronary artery disease. She also experienced an inferior myocardial infarction in 1995 requiring angioplasty, surgical repair of her femoral artery in 1995, and hernia repair in 1996. This patient has her INR checked in the anticoagulation clinic and is followed monthly by the clinical pharmacist. Prior to the interaction, her INR was therapeutic for 5 months while she was taking warfarin 1.5 mg/d. The patient admitted to doubling her fish oil dose from 1000 to 2000 mg/d. Without dietary, lifestyle, or medication changes, the INR increased from 2.8 to 4.3 within 1 month. The INR decreased to 1.6 one week after subsequent fish oil reduction, necessitating a return to the original warfarin dosing regimen.

Discussion

Fish oil supplementation could have provided additional anticoagulation with warfarin therapy. Fish oil, an omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid, consists of eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid. This fatty acid may affect platelet aggregation and/or vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors. Omega-3 fatty acids may lower thromboxane A(2) supplies within the platelet as well as decrease factor VII levels. Although controversial, this case report illustrates that fish oil can provide additive anticoagulant effects when given with warfarin.

Conclusions

This case reveals a significant rise in INR after the dose of concomitant fish oil was doubled. Patients undergoing anticoagulation therapy with warfarin should be educated about and monitored for possible drug-herb interactions. Pharmacists can play a crucial role in identifying possible drug interactions by asking patients taking warfarin about herbal and other alternative medicine product use.

### Efficacy and safety of apixaban compared with warfarin according to patient risk of stroke and of bleeding in atrial fibrillation: a secondary analysis of a randomised controlled trial [^112qrGRP]. Lancet (2012). Excellent credibility.

Background

The Apixaban for Reduction in Stroke and Other Thromboembolic Events in Atrial Fibrillation (ARISTOTLE) trial showed that apixaban is better than warfarin at prevention of stroke or systemic embolism, causes less bleeding, and results in lower mortality. We assessed in this trial's participants how results differed according to patients' CHADS(2), CHA(2)DS(2)VASc, and HAS-BLED scores, used to predict the risk of stroke and bleeding.

Methods

ARISTOTLE was a double-blind, randomised trial that enrolled 18,201 patients with atrial fibrillation in 39 countries. Patients were randomly assigned apixaban 5 mg twice daily (n = 9120) or warfarin (target international normalised ratio 2·0–3·0; n = 9081). The primary endpoint was stroke or systemic embolism. The primary safety outcome was major bleeding. We calculated CHADS(2), CHA(2)DS(2)VASc, and HAS-BLED scores of patients at randomisation. Efficacy analyses were by intention to treat, and safety analyses were of the population who received the study drug. ARISTOTLE is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00412984.

Findings

Apixaban significantly reduced stroke or systemic embolism with no evidence of a differential effect by risk of stroke (CHADS(2) 1, 2, or ≥ 3, p for interaction = 0·4457; or CHA(2)DS(2)VASc 1, 2, or ≥ 3, p for interaction = 0·1210) or bleeding (HAS-BLED 0–1, 2, or ≥ 3, p for interaction = 0·9422). Patients who received apixaban had lower rates of major bleeding than did those who received warfarin, with no difference across all score categories (CHADS(2), p for interaction = 0·4018; CHA(2)DS(2)VASc, p for interaction = 0·2059; HAS-BLED, p for interaction = 0·7127). The relative risk reduction in intracranial bleeding tended to be greater in patients with HAS-BLED scores of 3 or higher (hazard ratio [HR] 0·22, 95% CI 0·10–0·48) than in those with HAS-BLED scores of 0–1 (HR 0·66, 0·39–1·12; p for interaction = 0·0604).

Interpretation

Because apixaban has benefits over warfarin that are consistent across patient risk of stroke and bleeding as assessed by the CHADS2, CHA2DS2VASc, and HAS-BLED scores, these scores might be less relevant when used to tailor apixaban treatment to individual patients than they are for warfarin. Further improvement in risk stratification for both stroke and bleeding is needed, particularly for patients with atrial fibrillation at low risk for these events.

### Efficacy and safety of apixaban versus warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation and extremes in body weight [^113KsGMo]. Circulation (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Guidelines caution against the use of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants in patients with extremely high (> 120 kg) or low (≤ 60 kg) body weight because of a lack of data in these populations.

Methods

In a post hoc analysis of ARISTOTLE (Apixaban for Reduction in Stroke and Other Thromboembolic Events in Atrial Fibrillation; n = 18 201), a randomized trial comparing apixaban with warfarin for the prevention of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation, we estimated the randomized treatment effect (apixaban versus warfarin) stratified by body weight (≤ 60, > 60–120, > 120 kg) using a Cox regression model and tested the interaction between body weight and randomized treatment. The primary efficacy and safety outcomes were stroke or systemic embolism and major bleeding.

Results

Of the 18 139 patients with available weight and outcomes data, 1985 (10.9%) were in the low-weight group (≤ 60 kg), 15 172 (83.6%) were in the midrange weight group (> 60–120 kg), and 982 (5.4%) were in the high-weight group (> 120 kg). The treatment effect of apixaban versus warfarin for the efficacy outcomes of stroke/systemic embolism, all-cause death, or myocardial infarction was consistent across the weight spectrum (interaction P value > 0.05). For major bleeding, apixaban had a better safety profile than warfarin in all weight categories and even showed a greater relative risk reduction in patients in the low (≤ 60 kg; HR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.36–0.82) and midrange (> 60–120 kg) weight groups (HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.61–0.83; interaction P value = 0.016).

Conclusions

Our findings provide evidence that apixaban is efficacious and safe across the spectrum of weight, including in low- (≤ 60 kg) and high-weight patients (> 120 kg). The superiority on efficacy and safety outcomes of apixaban compared with warfarin persists across weight groups, with even greater reductions in major bleeding in patients with atrial fibrillation with low to normal weight as compared with high weight. The superiority of apixaban over warfarin in regard to efficacy and safety for stroke prevention seems to be similar in patients with atrial fibrillation across the spectrum of weight, including in low- and very high-weight patients. Thus, apixaban appears to be appropriate for patients with atrial fibrillation irrespective of body weight.

### Fish oil (omegaven) [^114G3xCg]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

Antiplatelet Agents and Anticoagulants: Prolonged bleeding time has been reported in patients taking antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants and oral omega-3 fatty acids. Periodically monitor bleeding time in patients receiving Omegaven and concomitant antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants. (7.1)

7.1 Antiplatelet Agents and Anticoagulants

Some published studies have demonstrated prolongation of bleeding time in patients taking antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants and oral omega-3 fatty acids. The prolongation of bleeding times reported in those studies did not exceed normal limits and there were no clinically significant bleeding episodes. Nonetheless, it is recommended to periodically monitor bleeding time in patients receiving Omegaven and concomitant antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants.

### Apixaban dose in patients with atrial Fibrillation and acute coronary syndrome and / or undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention: insights from AUGUSTUS [^114bf5Zs]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

The AUGUSTUS trial showed that, in patients with AF and ACS and/or PCI treated with a P2Y12 inhibitor, apixaban resulted in less bleeding and fewer hospitalizations than VKA and that aspirin resulted in more bleeding than placebo, without any significant difference in ischemic events. The present analysis extends the findings of the AUGUSTUS trial. We observed a significantly lower risk of major/CRNM bleeding and a similar rate of rehospitalization and ischemic events in patients appropriately receiving reduced dose apixaban compared with VKA. Similarly, there was a lower risk of major/CRNM bleeding and rehospitalization and a similar risk of ischemic events in patients appropriately receiving standard dose apixaban compared with VKA. Furthermore, the use of appropriately and inappropriately reduced dose apixaban as well as standard dose apixaban were generally associated with comparable clinical outcomes, with a signal toward less benefit with inappropriately reduced dose apixaban.

The same dose-reduction criteria were used in the ARISTOTLE (Apixaban for Reduction of Stroke and Other Thromboembolic Complications in Atrial Fibrillation) trial, which demonstrated that apixaban was superior to warfarin for the prevention of stroke or systemic embolism in patients with AF. In ARISTOTLE, a reduced dose of 2.5 mg twice daily (vs standard dose of 5.0 mg twice daily) of apixaban was given to patients who met ≥ 2 of the dose-reduction criteria in order to minimize the potential for higher drug exposures in a sample that may be at an increased risk of bleeding. Similar effects were observed for stroke or systemic embolism (P interaction = 0.22) and major bleeding (P interaction = 0.21) when comparing patients who appropriately received reduced dose apixaban with those who appropriately received standard dose apixaban.

Discussion

These observations from the ARISTOTLE study show that the risk of stroke, death, and major bleeding increases significantly with age, and that apixaban compared with warfarin reduces these outcomes in a consistent manner regardless of age, including in the group at least 80 years of age. As the absolute risks were higher in the older patient groups, the lack of interaction between treatment and age implies that the absolute benefits of apixaban were greater in the older population.

Previous studies have shown that anticoagulation treatment with warfarin is superior to antiplatelet treatment with aspirin for stroke prevention in patients with AF, even in the elderly. However, the risk of ICH, the numerous food and drug interactions, and the need for regular monitoring and dose adjustments complicate the long-term use of these drugs and render treatment with these agents problematic especially in the elderly. The development of new oral anticoagulants, at least as effective and safer than warfarin, with no requirement for routine coagulation monitoring and with less interactions than warfarin, is particularly attractive for the older patient group.

In this study, apixaban was shown to be superior to warfarin with respect to stroke prevention, bleeding complications, and mortality, with consistency across all age groups. The superiority of apixaban vs. warfarin was shown to be consistent even in patients ≥ 80 years. Taken together with the lack of need for coagulation monitoring and the few drug interactions, apixaban appears to be an attractive alternative for elderly patients with AF.

The dose of apixaban or placebo was reduced from 5 mg twice daily to 2.5 mg twice daily in 831 patients with two or more of the following factors: age ≥ 80 years, bodyweight ≤ 60 kg, and serum creatinine ≥ 133 μmol/L (≥ 1.5 mg/dL). Most of the patients receiving the reduced dose were ≥ 75 years old (n = 790). Target INR was kept at 2.0–3.0 in all patient groups according to current guidelines. The reduced dose was associated with a similar reduction in stroke and major bleeding as the normal dose of 5 mg twice daily, confirming that this was an appropriate dose in this high-risk group of patients.

### Apixaban (Eliquis) [^112j6s99]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Apixaban is a selective inhibitor of FXa. It does not require antithrombin III for antithrombotic activity. Apixaban inhibits free and clot-bound FXa, and prothrombinase activity. Apixaban has no direct effect on platelet aggregation, but indirectly inhibits platelet aggregation induced by thrombin. By inhibiting FXa, apixaban decreases thrombin generation and thrombus development.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

As a result of FXa inhibition, apixaban prolongs clotting tests such as prothrombin time (PT), INR, and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). Changes observed in these clotting tests at the expected therapeutic dose, however, are small, subject to a high degree of variability, and not useful in monitoring the anticoagulation effect of apixaban.

The Rotachrom®Heparin chromogenic assay was used to measure the effect of apixaban on FXa activity in humans primarily during the apixaban adult development program. A concentration-dependent increase in anti-FXa activity was observed in the dose range tested and was similar in healthy subjects and patients with AF.

This test is not recommended for assessing the anticoagulant effect of apixaban.

Effect of PCCs on Pharmacodynamics of ELIQUIS

There is no clinical experience to reverse bleeding with the use of 4-factor PCC products in individuals who have received ELIQUIS.

Effects of 4-factor PCCs on the pharmacodynamics of apixaban were studied in healthy subjects. Following administration of apixaban dosed to steady state, endogenous thrombin potential (ETP) returned to pre-apixaban levels 4 hours after the initiation of a 30-minute PCC infusion, compared to 45 hours with placebo. Mean ETP levels continued to increase and exceeded pre-apixaban levels reaching a maximum (34%-51% increase over pre-apixaban levels) at 21 hours after initiating PCC and remained elevated (21%-27% increase) at the end of the study (69 hours after initiation of PCC). The clinical relevance of this increase in ETP is unknown.

### The 2018 European Heart Rhythm Association practical guide on the use of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants in patients with atrial fibrillation [^112FikNY]. European Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

The current manuscript is the second update of the original Practical Guide, published in 2013 [Heidbuchel et al. European Heart Rhythm Association Practical Guide on the use of new oral anticoagulants in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. Europace 2013;15:625–651; Heidbuchel et al. Updated European Heart Rhythm Association Practical Guide on the use of non-vitamin K antagonist anticoagulants in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. Europace 2015;17:1467–1507]. Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are an alternative for vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) to prevent stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and have emerged as the preferred choice, particularly in patients newly started on anticoagulation. Both physicians and patients are becoming more accustomed to the use of these drugs in clinical practice. However, many unresolved questions on how to optimally use these agents in specific clinical situations remain. The European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA) set out to coordinate a unified way of informing physicians on the use of the different NOACs. A writing group identified 20 topics of concrete clinical scenarios for which practical answers were formulated, based on available evidence. The 20 topics are as follows i.e., (1) Eligibility for NOACs; (2) Practical start-up and follow-up scheme for patients on NOACs; (3) Ensuring adherence to prescribed oral anticoagulant intake; (4) Switching between anticoagulant regimens; (5) Pharmacokinetics and drug-drug interactions of NOACs; (6) NOACs in patients with chronic kidney or advanced liver disease; (7) How to measure the anticoagulant effect of NOACs; (8) NOAC plasma level measurement: rare indications, precautions, and potential pitfalls; (9) How to deal with dosing errors; (10) What to do if there is a (suspected) overdose without bleeding, or a clotting test is indicating a potential risk of bleeding; (11) Management of bleeding under NOAC therapy; (12) Patients undergoing a planned invasive procedure, surgery or ablation; (13) Patients requiring an urgent surgical intervention; (14) Patients with AF and coronary artery disease; (15) Avoiding confusion with NOAC dosing across indications; (16) Cardioversion in a NOAC-treated patient; (17) AF patients presenting with acute stroke while on NOACs; (18) NOACs in special situations; (19) Anticoagulation in AF patients with a malignancy; and (20) Optimizing dose adjustments of VKA. Additional information and downloads of the text and anticoagulation cards in different languages can be found on an EHRA website (www.NOACforAF.eu).

### Oral direct factor Xa inhibitors for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation [^116oX9Lw]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2012). Medium credibility.

Safe and effective stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation (AF) is crucial as the number of patients with this condition continues to increase. Several novel oral anticoagulants are being developed as replacements for warfarin for this indication. Direct factor Xa inhibitors comprise the largest class of oral anticoagulants in development; the inhibition of factor Xa is recognized to be a promising target for therapeutic anticoagulation, partly because of its location in the coagulation cascade. Apixaban, betrixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban are small-molecule, selective inhibitors that directly and reversibly bind to the active site of factor Xa. Their pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles vary, which might allow patient-specific therapy. Several of these agents have been tested in clinical trials for various indications, including AF, with favorable results. In particular, apixaban and rivaroxaban have shown superiority and noninferiority, respectively, to warfarin in phase III clinical trials for stroke prevention in AF. These agents have also been shown to be safe in terms of bleeding risk. Despite these advantages, factor Xa inhibitors have several characteristics, such as potential interactions with other drugs (inhibitors of cytochrome P450 and P-glycoprotein) and the inability to reverse their anticoagulant effects, as well as concerns about poor patient compliance, which must be considered when initiating patients on a novel factor Xa inhibitor.

### The future of atrial fibrillation therapy [^113g53JD]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2006). Low credibility.

Today management of atrial fibrillation (AF) centers on restoration and maintenance of normal sinus rhythm or control of the ventricular rate response to AF. Current guidelines state that rhythm and rate control strategies should be considered therapeutically equivalent, but recognize that no "one size fits all", an approach consistent with growing recognition of the heterogeneity of AF. As data from the Sotalol Amiodarone Atrial Fibrillation Efficacy Trial clearly demonstrate, conventional antiarrhythmics have a role in highly symptomatic AF accompanied by decreased quality of life. However, for many AF patients such drugs lack efficacy, have potentially serious side effects, and are poorly tolerated. In parallel with the development of more effective and safer antiarrhythmics, nontraditional approaches to prevention and treatment of AF are being explored. Treatments not considered "antiarrhythmic" that may prevent or forestall AF include aggressive antihypertensive therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, and some, but not all, beta-blockers and calcium channel antagonists, especially when used as adjunctive therapy. Other approaches include statins, steroids, and fish oil to reduce atrial fibrosis and inflammation, and pacemakers to prevent bradycardia-mediated AF and as a pacing preventive strategy in selected patients. Ablative techniques with potential to cure AF are gaining popularity, but are not yet simple, straightforward, and risk-free procedures. In the future, treatment of AF will progress beyond today's focus on AF as a purely electrocardiographic disease toward a patient and context-specific management strategy involving multiple treatment modalities.

### Impact of prior oral anticoagulant use and outcomes on patients from secondary analysis in the AUGUSTUS trial [^112ptudH]. Open Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Managing antithrombotic therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and/or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is challenging and can be affected by prior oral anticoagulant (OAC) treatment. We examined the relationship between prior OAC use and outcomes in the AUGUSTUS trial.

Methods

This prespecified secondary analysis is from AUGUSTUS, an open-label, 2-by-2 factorial, RCT to evaluate the safety of apixaban versus vitamin K antagonist (VKA) and aspirin versus placebo in patients with AF and ACS and/or PCI. The primary endpoint, major or clinically relevant non-major bleeding and clinical outcomes were compared in patients receiving (n = 2262) or not receiving (n = 2352) an OAC prior to enrolment.

Results

Patients with prior OAC use had more comorbidities, higher CHA 2 DS 2 -VASC and HAS-BLED scores, and were more likely enrolled following elective PCI. There was no difference in major or clinically relevant non-major bleeding with or without prior OAC (30 days: 5.1% vs 5.9% (adjusted HR (aHR) 0.82, 95%CI 0.63 to 1.06); 180 days: 13.5% vs 13.5% (aHR 0.98, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.16)). Patients with prior OAC use had a lower risk of death or ischaemic events (30 days: 1.7% vs 2.8% (aHR 0.61, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.92); 180 days: 5.4% vs 7.6% (aHR 0.70, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.88)). No interactions between randomised treatment (apixaban vs VKA, aspirin vs placebo) and prior OAC status were observed for outcomes, apart from apixaban (vs VKA) being associated with a lower risk of myocardial infarction with prior OAC use (180 days: 2.0% vs 3.7% (aHR 0.56, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.91().

Conclusions

In AUGUSTUS, prior OAC use was associated with fewer ischaemic events but not more bleeding. In patients with AF and ACS and/or undergoing PCI, clinicians can be assured that the trial results can be applied to patients regardless of their prior OAC status.

### 2023 ACC / AHA / ACCP / HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^1138PCer]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation — specific drug interaction directives for DOACs and dabigatran include contraindications and dose adjustments: Rivaroxaban is contraindicated with ketoconazole or ritonavir due to extreme increases in rivaroxaban levels (1580% or 1530%); apixaban requires dose adjustment to 2.5 mg twice daily when ketoconazole, itraconazole, or ritonavir is started, and apixaban plasma level increased by 99% with ketoconazole in healthy subjects; for patients with creatinine clearance (CrCl) 30 to 50 mL/min receiving dabigatran with dronedarone or ketoconazole, dose adjustment to dabigatran 75 mg twice daily is required to match exposure seen in patients with CrCl 15 to 29 mL/min on dronedarone alone.

### Fish oil and postoperative atrial fibrillation: the omega-3 fatty acids for prevention of post-operative atrial fibrillation (OPERA) randomized trial… [^113Ja8dy]. JAMA Network (2012). Excellent credibility.

Main Outcome Measure Occurrence of postoperative AF lasting longer than 30 seconds. Secondary end points were postoperative AF lasting longer than 1 hour, resulting in symptoms, or treated with cardioversion; postoperative AF excluding atrial flutter; time to first postoperative AF; number of AF episodes per patient; hospital utilization; and major adverse cardiovascular events, 30-day mortality, bleeding, and other adverse events. Use of chronic or prophylactic antiarrhythmic drugs, history of prior AF, and planned AF ablation were not exclusions, given the similar or higher risk of postoperative AF in these patients and no known biologic interaction that might reduce efficacy of n-3-PUFAs in such patients. The study was approved by the human subjects committees of all participating institutions and conducted according to international standards of Good Clinical Practice.

All patients provided written informed consent. Safety outcomes included adverse events and bleeding assessed by 24-hour chest tube output following surgery, total packed red blood cell transfusions, and composite bleeding indices. Potential adverse events were recorded and reported to the steering committee and the independent data and safety monitoring board, as well as to the US Food and Drug Administration, European Medicines Agency, and Argentina National Administration of Drugs, Foods and Medical Devices. Effects of n-3-PUFAs on the primary end point did not significantly differ among most prespecified subgroups. Potential interaction was observed only by type of cardiac surgery, with patients undergoing valve surgery having a trend toward lower risk of postoperative AF with n-3-PUFA treatment.

In post hoc analyses, risk of postoperative AF with n-3-PUFA treatment was similar whether valve surgery was aortic or mitral. Compared with patients in the placebo group, those in the n-3-PUFA group received significantly fewer packed red blood cell transfusions, including during surgery, after surgery, and overall. Other bleeding indices did not significantly differ by treatment. Minor adverse events commonly seen with fish oil, such as gastrointestinal upset, burping, and fish oil taste, occurred more commonly in the n-3-PUFA group. Adverse events requiring discontinuation of study drug and other serious adverse events were similar between groups.

### Polypharmacy and effects of apixaban versus warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation: post hoc analysis of the ARISTOTLE trial [^113T1LSo]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

In an era of increasing life expectancy, and with a growing population of survivors with various comorbidities, clinical decision making with regard to antithrombotic therapy for atrial fibrillation has become an even greater clinical challenge. Despite the well appreciated risk of stroke, oral anticoagulation is often not prescribed in older people, and undertreatment has been associated with adverse outcomes. However, physicians increasingly acknowledge that treatment decisions should probably be based on biological age rather than chronological age.

In various populations, polypharmacy has been associated with multiple comorbidities and frailty. Moreover, the risk of drug-drug interactions increases with the number of concomitant drug treatments. In addition, polypharmacy has been related to a higher risk of death and bleeding complications, also in patients with atrial fibrillation. In this context, patients with polypharmacy could have a differential response to anticoagulation therapy.

With the introduction of apixaban, a safer alternative to warfarin has become available that has also proven to be of value in patients considered unsuitable for warfarin treatment. In a previous report, we demonstrated that the benefits of apixaban versus warfarin were irrespective of age (< 65 years v 65–74 years v ≥ 75 years). However, among the elderly population, there are patients with hardly any comorbidity, whereas there are also younger patients with clinically significant comorbidity. On average, patients with atrial fibrillation use about four to six different drug treatments. Given that polypharmacy is generally defined as the use of five or more concomitant drug treatments, and thus represents an everyday issue, additional information on the effect of oral anticoagulation drugs in this subset of patients is of clinical importance. Especially in the case of apixaban, information on the effect of potentiating drugs is limited, and is of interest in patients treated with many concomitant drugs.

In this context, we performed a post hoc analysis of the ARISTOTLE trial (apixaban for reduction of stroke and other thromboembolic events in atrial fibrillation) to assess the association between the number of drugs used and the extent of comorbidity and adverse outcome. In addition, we looked at the relative treatment effect of apixaban versus warfarin in relation to the number of concomitant drug treatments.

### Prognosis of patients with ischemic stroke with prior anticoagulant therapy: direct oral anticoagulants versus warfarin [^1118vERy]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Atrial fibrillation is the most common cause of cardiac embolism in ischemic stroke, accounting for approximately 15% to 30% of all causes of ischemic stroke. Patients with ischemic stroke due to atrial fibrillation have more severe disability or higher mortality rates than those with other causes. Vitamin K antagonists are mainly used as oral anticoagulants. However, it is not easy to maintain a suitable drug concentration for treatment because they interact with foods and other drugs. Since dabigatran, apixaban, and rivaroxaban were recommended as new direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) to prevent ischemic stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation in 2012, DOACs are currently recommended as first‐line treatment.

However, ischemic stroke can occur even in patients with atrial fibrillation despite appropriate anticoagulant treatment. Previous studies have shown that 1% to 2% of ischemic strokes occur annually in patients with atrial fibrillation receiving DOACs. Among all patients with ischemic stroke, the proportion of patients who develop ischemic stroke while taking DOACs is gradually increasing, and it has recently been reported to account for up to 6%. In the study published in the United Kingdom, 10.4 patients in the vitamin K antagonist group and 9.4 in the DOAC group had ischemic stroke per 1000 person‐years of atrial fibrillation patients.

### Apixaban monitoring: the jury is still Out [^114JLzB2]. JACC: Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Current guidelines recommend using a direct-acting oral anticoagulant (DOAC) in preference to warfarin in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) and a CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score of 2 or higher. This recommendation is based on consistent findings from a series of large randomized trials demonstrating equivalent or superior efficacy of DOACs relative to warfarin in preventing stroke coupled with a lower risk for major bleeding, including intracranial hemorrhage. Clinically, DOACs are more convenient than warfarin for both clinicians and patients because they do not require routine monitoring and they have far fewer interactions with other medications and foods.

Yet, despite the favorable risk-benefit profile of DOACs, patients taking these medications remain at risk for stroke and bleeding complications. In the ARISTOTLE (Apixaban for Reduction In Stroke and Other ThromboemboLic Events in Atrial Fibrillation) trial, for example, patients randomized to apixaban experienced an annual stroke rate of 1.19% and an annual rate of major bleeding of 2.13%. In patients taking warfarin, it is well established that a subtherapeutic international normalized ratio (INR) is associated with an increased risk for stroke, while the risk for major bleeding rises progressively as the INR exceeds the therapeutic range. This suggests that some stroke events in patients taking DOACs may be linked to inadequate anticoagulation and that some bleeding events may be associated with excess anticoagulation. This in turn invites the question of whether monitoring DOAC levels, at least in selected patients at high risk for stroke or bleeding, would translate to improved outcomes for patients with NVAF.

### Icosapent ethyl [^1141vdj6]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter

Icosapent ethyl capsules are associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter requiring hospitalization. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 8,179 subjects, adjudicated atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter requiring hospitalization for 24 or more hours occurred in 127 (3%) patients treated with icosapent ethyl capsules compared to 84 (2%) patients receiving placebo [HR = 1.5 (95% CI 1.14, 1.98)]. The incidence of atrial fibrillation was greater in patients with a previous history of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter.

5.2 Potential for Allergic Reactions in Patients with Fish Allergy

Icosapent ethyl capsules contain ethyl esters of the omega-3 fatty acid, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), obtained from the oil of fish. It is not known whether patients with allergies to fish and/or shellfish are at increased risk of an allergic reaction to icosapent ethyl capsules. Inform patients with known hypersensitivity to fish and/or shellfish about the potential for allergic reactions to icosapent ethyl capsules and advise them to discontinue icosapent ethyl capsules and seek medical attention if any reactions occur.

5.3 Bleeding

Icosapent ethyl capsules are associated with an increased risk of bleeding. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 8,179 patients, 482 (12%) patients receiving icosapent ethyl capsules experienced a bleeding event compared to 404 (10%) patients receiving placebo. Serious bleeding events occurred in 111 (3%) of patients on icosapent ethyl capsules vs. 85 (2%) of patients receiving placebo. The incidence of bleeding was greater in patients receiving concomitant antithrombotic medications, such as aspirin, clopidogrel, or warfarin.

### Apixaban in patients with atrial fibrillation [^116pgzNT]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2011). Excellent credibility.

The study AVERROES was published by Connolly SJ and colleagues in 2011 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Atrial fibrillation, Acute ischemic stroke and Transient ischemic attack. In the AVERROES study, the trial question was: what is the role of apixaban in patients with AF who are at an increased risk for stroke for whom VKA therapy is unsuitable? In the AVERROES study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the AVERROES study, the population was: 5599 patients (2322 female, 3277 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with AF who were at increased risk for stroke and for whom VKA therapy was unsuitable. The key exclusion criteria were valvular disease requiring surgery, a serious bleeding event in the previous 6 months or a high risk of bleeding, current alcohol or drug abuse or psychosocial issues, life expectancy < 1 year, or severe renal insufficiency. In the AVERROES study, the interventions were: n = 2808 apixaban (5 mg PO BID) n = 2791 aspirin (81–324 mg PO once daily). In the AVERROES study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in the incidence of stroke or systemic embolism (1.6% / y vs. 3.7% / y; HR 0.45, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.62). In the AVERROES study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in death (3.5% vs. 4.4%; HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.02) Significant decrease in hospitalization for cardiovascular causes (12.6% vs. 15.9%; HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.91). In the AVERROES study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in major bleeding (1.4% vs. 1.2%, p = 0.57; HR 1.13, 95% CI 0.74–1.75). significant differences in serious adverse event (22% vs. 27%, p < 0.001). In the AVERROES study, the conclusion was: in patients with AF who were at increased risk for stroke and for whom VKA therapy was unsuitable, apixaban was superior to aspirin with respect to the incidence of stroke or systemic embolism.

### Efficacy and safety of apixaban compared with warfarin according to age for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation: observations from the ARISTOTLE trial [^1151h2xf]. European Heart Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Aims

The risk of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) increases with age. In the ARISTOTLE trial, apixaban when compared with warfarin reduced the rate of stroke, death, and bleeding. We evaluated these outcomes in relation to patient age.

Methods and Results

A total of 18 201 patients with AF and a raised risk of stroke were randomized to warfarin or apixaban 5 mg b.d. with dose reduction to 2.5 mg b.d. or placebo in 831 patients with ≥ 2 of the following criteria: age ≥ 80 years, body weight ≤ 60 kg, or creatinine ≥ 133 μmol/L. We used Cox models to compare outcomes in relation to patient age during 1.8 years median follow-up. Of the trial population, 30% were < 65 years, 39% were 65 to < 75, and 31% were ≥ 75 years. The rates of stroke, all-cause death, and major bleeding were higher in the older age groups (P < 0.001 for all). Apixaban was more effective than warfarin in preventing stroke and reducing mortality across all age groups, and associated with less major bleeding, less total bleeding, and less intracranial haemorrhage regardless of age (P interaction > 0.11 for all). Results were also consistent for the 13% of patients ≥ 80 years. No significant interaction with apixaban dose was found with respect to treatment effect on major outcomes.

Conclusion

The benefits of apixaban vs. warfarin were consistent in patients with AF regardless of age. Owing to the higher risk at older age, the absolute benefits of apixaban were greater in the elderly.

### Polypharmacy and effects of apixaban versus warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation: post hoc analysis of the ARISTOTLE trial [^114uMq8N]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

Objective To determine whether the treatment effect of apixaban versus warfarin differs with increasing numbers of concomitant drugs used by patients with atrial fibrillation.

Design Post hoc analysis performed in 2015 of results from ARISTOTLE (apixaban for reduction in stroke and other thromboembolic events in atrial fibrillation) — a multicentre, double blind, double dummy trial that started in 2006 and ended in 2011.

Participants 18 201 ARISTOTLE trial participants.

Interventions In the ARISTOTLE trial, patients were randomised to either 5 mg apixaban twice daily (n = 9120) or warfarin (target international normalised ratio range 2.0–3.0; n = 9081). In the post hoc analysis, patients were divided into groups according to the number of concomitant drug treatments used at baseline (0–5, 6–8, ≥ 9 drugs) with a median follow-up of 1.8 years.

Main outcome measures Clinical outcomes and treatment effects of apixaban versus warfarin (adjusted for age, sex, and country).

Results Each patient used a median of six drugs (interquartile range 5–9); polypharmacy (≥ 5 drugs) was seen in 13 932 (76.5%) patients. Greater numbers of concomitant drugs were used in older patients, women, and patients in the United States. The number of comorbidities increased across groups of increasing numbers of drugs (0–5, 6–8, ≥ 9 drugs), as did the proportions of patients treated with drugs that interact with warfarin or apixaban. Mortality also rose significantly with the number of drug treatments (P < 0.001), as did rates of stroke or systemic embolism (1.29, 1.48, and 1.57 per 100 patient years, for 0–5, 6–8, and ≥ 9 drugs, respectively) and major bleeding (1.91, 2.46, and 3.88 per 100 patient years, respectively). Relative risk reductions in stroke or systemic embolism for apixaban versus warfarin were consistent, regardless of the number of concomitant drugs (P interaction = 0.82). A smaller reduction in major bleeding was seen with apixaban versus warfarin with increasing numbers of concomitant drugs (P interaction = 0.017). Patients with interacting (potentiating) drugs for warfarin or apixaban had similar outcomes and consistent treatment effects of apixaban versus warfarin.

Conclusions In the ARISTOTLE trial, three quarters of patients had polypharmacy; this subgroup had an increased comorbidity, more interacting drugs, increased mortality, and higher rates of thromboembolic and bleeding complications. In terms of a potential differential response to anticoagulation therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation and polypharmacy, apixaban was more effective than warfarin, and is at least just as safe.

### Is atrial fibrillation an inflammatory disorder? [^115EZUXi]. European Heart Journal (2006). Low credibility.

There is mounting evidence to support the influence of inflammation in the pathogenesis of atrial fibrillation (AF). Indeed, AF is associated with increased levels of known inflammatory markers, even after adjustment for confounding factors. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) appears to play a key role in this process. Atrial biopsies from patients with AF have also confirmed the presence of inflammation. Furthermore, there is preliminary evidence to support a number of drug therapies that have the potential to reduce the clinical burden of AF. In this review, we present an overview of the evidence supporting a link between inflammation and AF, and some of the drug therapies, such as the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, steroids, fish oils, and vitamin C, that might be efficacious in the prevention of AF by modulating inflammatory pathways.

### Polypharmacy and effects of apixaban versus warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation: post hoc analysis of the ARISTOTLE trial [^114Ga21A]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

In the ARISTOTLE trial as well as in the ROCKET AF trial, patients with polypharmacy were older. Nonetheless, the relative reduction of both apixaban and rivaroxaban on major bleeding proved to be consistent across the different age groups in previously reported post hoc analyses. Importantly, this implies that our findings cannot be inferred to older patients in general. In fact, our findings are irrespective of age and sex, and refer to the group of patients, both younger and older, with multiple comorbidities and drug treatments.

Possible explanations for the attenuation of the observed safety benefit of apixaban with increasing concomitant drugs include effects of comorbidity and drug-drug interactions, or the play of chance. We demonstrated that various coexisting diseases (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, gastrointestinal disease, renal impairment) were more frequent with increasing numbers of concomitant drugs. Of interest, given the consistent risk reduction of apixaban for intracranial bleeding, the treatment interaction for major bleeding is related to other major bleeding. Risk factors for gastrointestinal bleeding complications (eg, previous gastric ulcers; gastrointestinal surgery; dyspepsia; use of aspirin, prednisone, or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) were more prevalent among patients with polypharmacy. Other non-gastrointestinal risk factors for bleeding were also more often common in patients using more concomitant drugs (eg, older age, renal impairment, anaemia, diabetes, and previous bleeding).

Other aspects that could account for the reduced benefit of apixaban in patients using nine concomitant drugs or more are the higher rates of permanent study drug discontinuation and lower proportion of patients who were vitamin K antagonist naive (supplementary table 1). The lower rates of patients on study medication may have blunted the observed risk reduction of apixaban in this group. In addition, bleeding rates on warfarin are usually lower in patients with prior experience vitamin K antagonists. Finally, the better control of international normalised ratio in the patients with more than nine concomitant drug treatments may have diminished bleeding rates on warfarin.

For drug-drug interactions, we specifically studied the effect of warfarin potentiating drugs and the combination of CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein inhibitors, given the possibility of higher plasma concentrations of apixaban with these agents. However, we saw no evidence of differential treatment effect between apixaban and warfarin across groups of the number of concomitant drugs when accounting for warfarin or apixaban potentiating drugs.

### Polypharmacy and effects of apixaban versus warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation: post hoc analysis of the ARISTOTLE trial [^112n8Vzr]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

Study limitations

This study had several limitations. Firstly, it was a post hoc analysis, although there was a prospective, detailed analysis plan. Secondly, the analyses were based on the drug burden at baseline, without information on drug changes, reason, or appropriateness of drug prescription. However, with polypharmacy that is often driven by chronic medical conditions, substantial reductions in the number of drugs are not likely. Thirdly, as the number of drugs might not only be driven by the extent of comorbidity, but also by prescription patterns, we acknowledge that this might have affected classification on an individual level. However, on a group level, the use of polypharmacy has repeatedly demonstrated to be a marker of the extent of comorbidity and associated with adverse outcome.

The cut-off value of five or more drugs is arbitrary, although it has been used in many previous reports. Given that three quarters of patients would qualify for polypharmacy according to this definition, our statistical approach was not arbitrary, but based on a common approach of dividing our data into groups to explore polypharmacy across categories that are sufficiently large to avoid the hazard of small subgroups. With regard to generalisability, our findings might not apply to an unselected population with atrial fibrillation, given the selection that occurs when enrolling patients in clinical trials.

Conclusions

In this population with atrial fibrillation on oral anticoagulation therapy, polypharmacy (≥ 5 drugs) was observed in three quarters of patients. The extent of comorbidity increased with greater numbers of concomitant drugs, which was irrespective of regional prescription patterns. Mortality, stroke, and major bleeding were also more frequent with increasing numbers of drugs. As for a potential differential response to anticoagulation therapy in this context, we observed that apixaban was superior to warfarin in terms of efficacy, regardless of the number of drugs taken, whereas its magnitude of benefit on major bleeding decreased with higher numbers of concomitant drugs. Important differences in the comorbidity profile could account for this, and it did not appear that warfarin or apixaban potentiating drugs (CYP3A4, P-glycoprotein inhibitors) explained this observed treatment interaction. In summary, apixaban is more effective than and is at least as safe as warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation, regardless of polypharmacy.

### Future directions of stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation: the potential impact of novel anticoagulants and stroke risk stratification [^113TwVvG]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2011). Low credibility.

Stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation is of paramount importance given its associated morbidity and mortality. The many challenges of warfarin limit its effective use in real-world clinical practice. We are entering an exciting therapeutic era as new classes of anticoagulants, including direct thrombin inhibitors, factor Xa inhibitors and novel vitamin K antagonists, are being evaluated for possible use in this patient population. If proven to be as efficacious as warfarin and safer, expanded use of these novel agents to lower risk subgroups may be justified. It is imperative that providers be aware of the many advantages and potential challenges posed by use of these novel agents in routine clinical care. An understanding of individual pharmacokinetic profiles and potential drug-drug and drug-disease interactions will translate into improved effectiveness in real-world practice.

### Efficacy and safety of apixaban compared with warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation and peripheral artery disease: insights from the ARISTOTLE trial [^114iAers]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Background

We studied (1) the rates of stroke or systemic embolism and bleeding in patients with atrial fibrillation and peripheral artery disease and (2) the efficacy and safety of apixaban versus warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation with and without.

Methods and Results

The Apixaban for Reduction in Stroke and Other Thromboembolic Events in Atrial Fibrillation (ARISTOTLE) trial randomized 18 201 patients with atrial fibrillation to apixaban or warfarin for stroke/systemic embolism prevention; 884 (4.9%) patients hadat baseline. Patients withhad higher unadjusted rates of stroke and systemic embolism (hazard ratio 1.73, 95%1.22–2.45; P = 0.002) and major bleeding (1.34, 95%1.00–1.81; P = 0.05), but after adjustment, no differences existed in rates of stroke and systemic embolism (1.32, 95%0.93–1.88; P = 0.12) and major bleeding (1.03, 95%0.76–1.40; P = 0.83) compared with patients without. The risk of stroke or systemic embolism was similar in patients assigned to apixaban and warfarin with(0.63, 95%0.32–1.25) and without(0.80, 95%0.66–0.96; interaction P = 0.52). Patients withdid not have a statistically significant reduction in major or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding with apixaban compared with warfarin (1.05, 95%0.69–1.58), whereas those withouthad a statistically significant reduction (0.65, 95%0.58–0.73; interaction P = 0.03).

Conclusions

Patients withinhad a higher crude risk of stroke or systemic embolism compared with patients withoutthat was not present after adjustment. The benefits of apixaban versus warfarin for stroke and systemic embolism were similar in patients with and without. These findings highlight the need to optimize the treatment of patients with atrial fibrillation and.

### Evaluation of the novel factor Xa inhibitor edoxaban compared with warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation: design and rationale for the effective aNticoaGulation with factor xA next GEneration in atrial fibrillation-thrombolysis in myocardial infarction study 48 (ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48) [^116XEoB6]. American Heart Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Vitamin K antagonists have been the standard oral antithrombotic used for more than a half century for prevention and treatment of thromboembolism. Their limitations include multiple food and drug interactions and need for frequent monitoring and dose adjustments. Edoxaban is a selective and direct factor Xa inhibitor that may provide effective, safe, and more convenient anticoagulation.

Study Design

ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 is a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, multinational, noninferiority design megatrial comparing 2 exposure strategies of edoxaban to warfarin. Approximately 20,500 subjects will be randomized to edoxaban high exposure (60 mg daily, adjusted for drug clearance), edoxaban low exposure (30 mg daily, adjusted for drug clearance), or warfarin titrated to an international normalized ratio of 2.0 to 3.0. The edoxaban strategies provide for dynamic dose reductions in subjects with anticipated increased drug exposure. Blinded treatment is maintained through the use of sham international normalized ratios in patients receiving edoxaban. Eligibility criteria include electrical documentation of atrial fibrillation ≤ 12 months and a CHADS(2) score ≥ 2. Randomization is stratified by CHADS(2) score and anticipated drug exposure. The primary objective is to determine whether edoxaban is noninferior to warfarin for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism. The primary safety end point is modified International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis major bleeding. Recruitment began in November 2008. The expected median follow-up is 24 months.

Conclusions

ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 is a phase 3 comparison of the novel oral factor Xa inhibitor edoxaban to warfarin for the prevention of thromboembolism in patients with atrial fibrillation.

### Novel oral anticoagulants for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation: key trial findings and clinical implications [^115SPqYc]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Novel oral anticoagulants have the potential to improve stroke prevention in patients who have atrial fibrillation and an elevated risk of stroke by overcoming several limitations of warfarin, such as the need for regular monitoring and dose adjustment, and the existence of multiple drug interactions and dietary restrictions. In recently completed phase III trials in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation, common findings for dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban compared with warfarin included: risk reductions for stroke and systemic embolism, significantly fewer hemorrhagic strokes and intracranial hemorrhages, and reductions in mortality, although different trends were seen in several endpoints. However, the trials had important differences in terms of design, populations studied, and statistical analysis that preclude comparison between trials and should be considered when interpreting findings. In this article, data for novel anticoagulants are reviewed and some potential practical implications are highlighted.

### Comparative safety and effectiveness of oral anticoagulants in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation: the NAXOS study [^113Khevx]. Stroke (2020). Medium credibility.

Although vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) are highly effective in the prevention and treatment of thromboembolic events, they have limitations related to drug and food interactions. VKAs also have a narrow therapeutic margin, requiring frequent monitoring, with a particular concern for an increased risk of intracranial bleeding. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) represent an alternative to VKAs and inhibit coagulation by directly and specifically binding to the active site of either thrombin (dabigatran) or factor Xa (rivaroxaban and apixaban). Due to a large therapeutic index, DOACs can be given in fixed doses without routine coagulation monitoring and have limited drug and food interactions. Randomized trials have generally established superior safety and at least similar efficacy of DOACs with VKAs in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF).

ARISTOTLE (Apixaban for Reduction in Stroke and Other Thromboembolic Events in Atrial Fibrillation), a randomized, double-blind trial, compared apixaban with warfarin in patients with NVAF and ≥ 1 additional risk factor for thromboembolism. In that trial, apixaban reduced stroke/systemic embolism, bleeding, and mortality compared with warfarin. On the basis of ARISTOTLE, French regulators (Health Authority and Transparency Committee) approved apixaban for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with NVAF and ≥ 1 risk factor(s), but required a postmarketing effectiveness study. To satisfy this request, the NAXOS study (Evaluation of Apixaban in Stroke and Systemic Embolism Prevention in Patients With Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation) was designed to describe the real-world use of apixaban and other oral anticoagulants (OACs) available in France (VKAs, dabigatran, and rivaroxaban). NAXOS aimed to evaluate the risks of major bleeding (safety), stroke and systemic thromboembolic events (STEs; effectiveness), and all-cause mortality comparing apixaban with other OACs. In the absence of randomized, controlled head-to-head comparisons between DOACs, high-quality observational data can provide useful information on the comparative effectiveness of DOACs. Because France has near-universal healthcare coverage and a unified national healthcare data system (covering > 90% of the total French population of ≈66 million individuals), NAXOS provided a good opportunity for a large population-based analysis of the comparative effectiveness of the OACs used in France for NVAF, focused on apixaban.

### Comparative risk of atrial fibrillation onset in statin-treated patients initiating icosapent ethyl and omega-3 acid ethyl esters: a Retrospective cohort study [^115uJcXP]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Although recent guidelines recommend IPE for its cardiovascular benefits, our findings suggest that it should be used carefully due to the associated risk of AF. This highlights the importance of balancing therapeutic benefits with arrhythmia risks on the basis of patients' underlying health status and the need for individualized risk assessment. As IPE use has been increasing, our results and emerging clinical evidence underscore the need for evaluation of AF risk in IPE and other omega‐3 fatty acid therapies. Particular attention should be given to the DHA:EPA ratio, patient‐specific risk profiles, and long‐term AF monitoring.

Limitations

Our study has several limitations that should be considered. First, we were unable to capture the dispensing of over‐the‐counter (OTC) fish oils. However, it is unlikely that patients would concurrently take IPE or DHA/EPA together with OTC fish oils. Even with a small chance of concurrent use of prescription IPE or DHA/EPA with nutritional supplements, the pattern of the OTC medication or dietary supplement use would not be different between the IPE‐ and DHA/EPA‐treated groups, having no or very nominal influence on the exposure–outcome association. Additionally, lifestyle factors such as dietary omega‐3 fatty acid intake, smoking, and alcohol use are potential confounders that could impact the risk of AF but are not captured or are incompletely recorded in the available data set. In particular, dietary omega‐3 intake may introduce unmeasured confounding, as we could not adjust for individual dietary habits that may influence cardiovascular outcomes.

We also did not account for changes in statin dosage or the alteration of other medications after the follow‐up period began. While we believe that our matching strategy reduced the concern on the difference in the patterns of the use of the other agents or statin dose alterations between the IPE‐ and DHA/EPA‐treated groups, future research could benefit from clinical trials that more rigorously control these factors. We did not follow‐up on participant AF outcomes in this study. Understanding of the consequences of AF, including the need for therapeutic interventions, the potential progression to paroxysmal or permanent AF, and associated health care costs, is important for patients considering the use of these agents or dietary supplements. Additionally, the effects among patients who discontinue IPE or DHA/EPA, including whether AF events persist after discontinuation, should be further explored in future studies.

Oral anticoagulants — vitamin K antagonists — note that "Since the 1950s, warfarin was used as a first-line therapy until DOACs came into practice", but its "narrow therapeutic window" with INRs, monitoring, drug interactions, dietary restrictions, and "low clinical safety profile affected the routine use of warfarin in practice". Due to affordability barriers to DOACs, "warfarin is still an appropriate OAC due to its lower cost for patients who cannot afford DOACs", and utilization data show "About 21% of patients with nonvalvular AF were still receiving warfarin, while the rest received DOACs in the first quarter of 2017".

### Apixaban for reduction in stroke and other thromboemboLic events in atrial fibrillation (ARISTOTLE) trial: design and rationale [^116NrTwd]. American Heart Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with increased risk of stroke that can be attenuated with vitamin K antagonists (VKAs). Vitamin K antagonist use is limited, in part, by the high incidence of complications when patients' international normalized ratios (INRs) deviate from the target range. The primary objective of ARISTOTLE is to determine if the factor Xa inhibitor, apixaban, is noninferior to warfarin at reducing the combined endpoint of stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic) and systemic embolism in patients with AF and at least 1 additional risk factor for stroke. We have randomized 18,206 patients from over 1,000 centers in 40 countries. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive apixaban or warfarin using a double-blind, double-dummy design. International normalized ratios are monitored and warfarin (or placebo) is adjusted aiming for a target INR range of 2 to 3 using a blinded, encrypted point-of-care device. Minimum treatment is 12 months, and maximum expected exposure is 4 years. Time to accrual of at least 448 primary efficacy events will determine treatment duration. The key secondary objectives are to determine if apixaban is superior to warfarin for the combined endpoint of stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic) and systemic embolism, and for all-cause death. These will be tested after the primary objective using a closed test procedure. The noninferiority boundary is 1.38; apixaban will be declared noninferior if the 95% CI excludes the possibility that the primary outcome rate with apixaban is > 1.38 times higher than with warfarin. ARISTOTLE will determine whether apixaban is noninferior or superior to warfarin in preventing stroke and systemic embolism; whether apixaban has particular benefits in the warfarin-naïve population; whether it reduces the combined rate of stroke, systemic embolism, and death; and whether it impacts bleeding.

### Serious bleeding in patients with atrial fibrillation using diltiazem with apixaban or rivaroxaban… [^115PRFeH]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Analysis was adjusted for the covariates listed in eTable 7 in Supplement 1 with overlap weighting. HR, indicates hazard ratio; PY, person-years; RD, rate difference. Question Do patients with atrial fibrillation receiving apixaban or rivaroxaban and concurrently treated for ventricular rate control with diltiazem have greater risk of serious bleeding than those treated with metoprolol. Conclusions and Relevance In Medicare patients with atrial fibrillation receiving apixaban or rivaroxaban, diltiazem was associated with greater risk of serious bleeding than metoprolol, particularly for diltiazem doses exceeding 120 mg/d.

Although both the US Food and Drug Administration labels for apixaban6 and rivaroxaban5 and the American College of Cardiology, American Heart Association, American College of Clinical Pharmacy, and Heart Rhythm Society guidelines for management of atrial fibrillation17 acknowledge that anticoagulant management should consider drug-drug interactions, neither specifically mentions increased risk of bleeding as a potential consequence of diltiazem coadministration. Observational studies have had mixed findings, 18–25 but many of these were limited by relatively small sample size, lack of an active comparator, and incomplete control for confounding. Because diltiazem is an effective and well-tolerated drug for rate control in patients with atrial fibrillation, particularly for those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 7, 26, 27 a pro-hemorrhagic interaction with direct factor Xa inhibitors would have important clinical consequences for millions of patients.

Thus, we conducted a retrospective cohort study involving Medicare beneficiaries with atrial fibrillation receiving apixaban or rivaroxaban to estimate the risk of serious bleeding associated with diltiazem treatment. In this national cohort study of 204 155 Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 years or older with atrial fibrillation who initiated apixaban or rivaroxaban use and also began treatment with diltiazem or metoprolol, diltiazem treatment was associated with a significantly increased risk of serious bleeding, defined as a bleeding-related hospitalization or death with recent evidence of bleeding, compared with metoprolol treatment. The absolute risk of serious bleeding associated with diltiazem treatment increased with diltiazem doses higher than 120 mg/d; increased HAS-BLED score, which summarizes common risk factors for anticoagulant-related hemorrhage; and rivaroxaban use, which has been consistently associated with rates of serious bleeding greater.

Interacting drugs

The proportion of patients using an interacting drug increased across the groups of concomitant drug treatments, both for CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein inhibitors as warfarin potentiating drugs. At least one combined inhibitor of both the CYP3A4 enzyme and P-glycoprotein was used by 20.9% (1903/9120) of patients treated with apixaban, and 21.1% (1913/9081) of patients treated with warfarin used vitamin K antagonist potentiating drugs. For the concomitant use of aspirin, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or prednisone, proportions were 13.8%, 31.7%, and 49.7% for the three groups (0–5, 6–8, and ≥ 9 drugs, respectively; P < 0.001).

Rates of major bleeding did not significantly differ between patients with or without combined CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein inhibitors (2.59 v 2.61 per 100 patient years, respectively). Moreover, no significant interaction with the treatment allocation was observed (P = 0.39; table 4). With regard to drugs known to potentiate warfarin, we also observed no difference in the event rate of major bleeding for users versus non-users (2.60 v 2.61 per 100 patient years).

### Antithrombotic therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation after acute coronary syndromes or percutaneous intervention [^113iUNcJ]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The use of apixaban instead of vitamin K antagonists (VKA) as well as dropping aspirin results in less bleeding and comparable ischemic events in patients with atrial fibrillation and acute coronary syndrome and/or percutaneous coronary intervention treated with a P2Y 12 inhibitor.

Objectives

The authors assessed the safety and efficacy of antithrombotic regimens according to HAS-BLED and CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc scores in AUGUSTUS (The Open-Label, 2 × 2 Factorial, Randomized, Controlled Clinical Trial to Evaluate the Safety of Apixaban vs. Vitamin K Antagonist and Aspirin vs. Placebo in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation and Acute Coronary Syndrome and/or Percutaneous Coronary Intervention).

Methods

In AUGUSTUS, 4,614 patients were randomized in a 2-by-2 factorial design to open-label apixaban or VKA and blinded aspirin or placebo. The primary endpoint was major or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding over 6 months of follow-up. Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess treatment effects by baseline HAS-BLED (≤ 2 vs ≥ 3) and CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc (≤ 2 vs ≥ 3) scores.

Results

Of 4,386 (95.1%) patients with calculable scores, 66.8% had HAS-BLED ≥ 3 and 81.7% had CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc ≥ 3. Bleeding rates were lower with apixaban than VKA irrespective of baseline risk (HR: 0.57; 95% CI: 0.41–0.78 [HAS-BLED ≤ 2]; HR: 0.72; 95% CI: 0.59–0.88 [HAS-BLED ≥ 3]; interaction P = 0.23). Aspirin increased bleeding irrespective of baseline risk (HR: 1.86; 95% CI: 1.36–2.56 [HAS-BLED ≤ 2]; HR: 1.81; 95% CI: 1.47–2.23 [HAS-BLED ≥ 3]; interaction P = 0.88). Apixaban resulted in a lower risk of death or hospitalization than VKA without a significant interaction with baseline stroke risk (HR: 0.92; 95% CI: 0.67–1.25 [CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc ≤ 2]; HR: 0.82; 95% CI: 0.73–0.94 [CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc ≥ 3]; interaction P = 0.53).

Conclusions

Our findings support the use of apixaban and a P2Y 12 inhibitor without aspirin for most patients with atrial fibrillation and acute coronary syndrome and/or percutaneous coronary intervention, irrespective of a patient's baseline bleeding and stroke risk (NCT02415400).

In patients with AF treated with oral anticoagulation, higher levels of ApoA1 were independently associated with lower risk of ischemic cardiovascular outcomes, including stroke/SEE and mortality. Higher ApoB levels were associated with higher rates of MI, but, paradoxically, lower risk of all‐cause mortality. The benefits of apixaban over warfarin were consistent, regardless of the levels of ApoA1 and ApoB. Our findings provide unique insights to the interaction between AF and lipoproteins, and suggest that investigating therapies targeting dyslipidemia may play a role in improving cardiovascular outcomes in patients with AF.

### Fish oil for the reduction of atrial fibrillation recurrence, inflammation, and oxidative stress [^115w8pD9]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Recent trials of fish oil for the prevention of atrial fibrillation (AF) recurrence have provided mixed results. Notable uncertainties in the existing evidence base include the roles of high-dose fish oil, inflammation, and oxidative stress in patients with paroxysmal or persistent AF not receiving conventional antiarrhythmic (AA) therapy.

Objectives

The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of high-dose fish oil on AF recurrence, inflammation, and oxidative stress parameters.

Methods

We performed a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-arm study in 337 patients with symptomatic paroxysmal or persistent AF within 6 months of enrollment. Patients were randomized to fish oil (4 g/day) or placebo and followed, on average, for 271 ± 129 days.

Results

The primary endpoint was time to first symptomatic or asymptomatic AF recurrence lasting > 30 s. Secondary endpoints were high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and myeloperoxidase (MPO). The primary endpoint occurred in 64.1% of patients in the fish oil arm and 63.2% of patients in the placebo arm (hazard ratio: 1.10; 95% confidence interval: 0.84 to 1.45; p = 0.48). hs-CRP and MPO were within normal limits at baseline and decreased to a similar degree at 6 months (Δhs-CRP, 11% vs. -11%; ΔMPO, -5% vs. -9% for fish oil vs. placebo, respectively; p value for interaction = NS).

Conclusions

High-dose fish oil does not reduce AF recurrence in patients with a history of AF not receiving conventional AA therapy. Furthermore, fish oil does not reduce inflammation or oxidative stress markers in this population, which may explain its lack of efficacy.

### Practical considerations for using novel oral anticoagulants in patients with atrial fibrillation [^116Vbbk6]. Clinical Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Novel oral anticoagulants, including dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban, represent new options for preventing stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation, as shown by the results from large, randomized phase III trials. Because of their greater specificity, rapid onset of action, and predictable pharmacokinetics, the novel oral anticoagulants (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban) address several limitations of warfarin or other vitamin K antagonists in day-to-day clinical practice. However, a range of practical questions relating to the novel oral anticoagulants has emerged, including topics such as patient selection, treatment of patients with renal impairment, risk of myocardial infarction, drug interactions, switching between anticoagulants, and management of bleeding, in addition to use of these agents in patients requiring antiplatelet drug treatment or undergoing cardioversion or percutaneous interventions (eg, ablation). In this review, practical aspects of the use of novel oral anticoagulants in patients with atrial fibrillation are discussed, with reference to available data and guidance from prescribing information.

### Comparative risk of atrial fibrillation onset in statin-treated patients initiating icosapent ethyl and omega-3 acid ethyl esters: a Retrospective cohort study [^114M67EU]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Despite the mechanisms by which omega‐3 fatty acids may influence the risk of AF are not fully understood, emerging evidence has begun to postulate several potential electrophysiological and structural pathways. Traditionally, omega‐3 fatty acids have been known to stabilize cardiac cell membranes and protect against arrhythmias (particularly ventricular arrhythmias) through their direct electrophysiological effects and modulation of processes involved in atrial remodeling. However, omega‐3 fatty acids also directly influence cardiac ion channels, including those regulating calcium, sodium, and potassium currents. These interactions can affect the duration of the ventricular action potential and potentially disrupt the heart's electrical stability. Therefore, though omega‐3 fatty acids may reduce arrhythmias in situations involving triggered activity, under some conditions they can also contribute to the development of reentrant arrhythmias. This potential dual action could account for the conflicting results seen in clinical trials on fish oil consumption and its association with sudden death and arrhythmias. Emerging studies suggest that these effects might be mediated, at least in part, by a mechanosensitive ion channel protein (PIEZO), which are mechanosensitive ion channels that respond to physical forces. When mechanical stress increases, the dome‐shaped structure of these channels flattens, opening a central pore and allowing positively charged ions like calcium to flow into the cell. Omega‐3 fatty acids, which are incorporated into the cardiomyocyte surface membranes, may influence this mechanical sensitivity by making the membranes thinner and more compliant. The specific effects of omega‐3 fatty acids on PIEZO1 activity appear to depend on the type of fatty acid. DHA prolongs the active state of PIEZO1 channels, while EPA causes them to deactivate more quickly. Thus, the ratio of DHA and EPA in omega‐3 fatty acids could be a critical determinant of PIEZO1‐mediated effects. The imbalance and increased ratio of DHA can lead to AF. Similarly, since IPE consists solely of EPA, any potential association between IPE intake, alterations in the DHA:EPA ratio, and increased AF risk remains speculative and warrants further investigation. PIEZO1 channels may also be involved in mechanical stress signaling in other atrial cell types, such as fibroblasts. Research shows that PIEZO1 expression and activity are increased in atrial fibroblasts. Moreover, changes to the cell membrane caused by omega‐3 fatty acid intake may affect more than just PIEZO1 channels. These alterations could influence voltage‐gated ion channels, ionic pumps, cell surface receptors, and interactions between the extracellular matrix and the cytoskeleton, all of which may contribute to a proarrhythmic environment. Further clinical trials are required to understand the processes by which omega‐3 fatty acid supplementation increases the AF risk and alters the electrophysiological characteristics of the myocardium.

Perioperative antithrombotic management — Fish oil supplements: Fish oil "possesses omega-3 fatty acids, which can increase bleeding risk; however, a large study" found "no difference in bleeding risks when compared to placebo groups". A 2006 systematic review of "9 studies involving 2,612 patients" reported "either no bleeding or no consistent association" between omega-3 dose and bleeding risk. In a 2024 publication, regular fish oil use in people with no known cardiovascular disease "was associated with an increased relative risk of atrial fibrillation and stroke", whereas in those with known cardiovascular disease "beneficial effects" were observed on transitions including "atrial fibrillation to myocardial infarction, and heart failure to death"; overall, evidence is "controversial", and further study is noted including effects "on bleeding risk alone or in combination with other anticoagulants or antiplatelets".

### Clinical and pharmacological effects of apixaban dose adjustment in the ARISTOTLE trial [^114Xcg4W]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

In the ARISTOTLE (Apixaban for Reduction in Stroke and Other Thromboembolic Events in Atrial Fibrillation) trial, patients with atrial fibrillation and ≥ 2 dose-adjustment criteria (age ≥ 80 years, weight ≤ 60 kg, or creatinine ≥ 1.5 mg/dl [133 μmol/l]) were randomized to receive apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily or warfarin.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to describe the effects of apixaban dose adjustment on clinical and pharmacological outcomes.

Methods

Patients receiving the correct dose of study drug were included (n = 18,073). The effect of apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily versus warfarin on population pharmacokinetics, D-dimer, prothrombin fragment 1 + 2 (PF1+2), and clinical outcomes was compared with the standard dose (5 mg twice daily).

Results

Patients receiving apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily exhibited lower apixaban exposure (median area under the concentration time curve at a steady state 2,720 ng/ml vs. 3,599 ng/ml; p < 0.0001) than those receiving the standard dose. In patients with ≥ 2 dose-adjustment criteria, reductions in D-dimers (p interaction = 0.20) and PF1+2 (p interaction = 0.55) were consistent with those observed in the standard-dose population. Patients with ≥ 2 dose-adjustment criteria (n = 751) were at higher risk for stroke/systemic embolism, major bleeding, and all-cause death than the standard-dose population (0 or 1 dose-adjustment criterion, n = 17,322). The effect of apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily versus warfarin in the ≥ 2 dose-adjustment criteria population was consistent with the standard dose in the reductions in stroke or systemic embolism (p interaction = 0.26), major bleeding (p interaction = 0.25), and death (p interaction = 0.72).

Conclusions

Apixaban drug concentrations were lower in patients receiving 2.5 mg twice daily compared with 5 mg twice daily. However, the effects of apixaban dose adjustment to 2.5 mg versus warfarin were consistent for coagulation biomarkers and clinical outcomes, providing reassuring data on efficacy and safety.

### Apixaban versus aspirin for stroke prevention in people with subclinical atrial fibrillation and a history of stroke or transient ischaemic attack: subgroup analysis of the ARTESiA randomised controlled trial [^1159vUqM]. The Lancet: Neurology (2025). High credibility.

Background

People with subclinical atrial fibrillation are at increased risk of stroke, albeit to a lesser extent than those with clinical atrial fibrillation, leading to an ongoing debate regarding the benefit of anticoagulation in these individuals. In the ARTESiA trial, the direct-acting oral anticoagulant apixaban reduced stroke or systemic embolism compared with aspirin in people with subclinical atrial fibrillation, but the risk of major bleeding was increased with apixaban. In a prespecified subgroup analysis of ARTESiA, we tested the hypothesis that people with subclinical atrial fibrillation and a history of stroke or transient ischaemic attack, who are known to have an increased risk of recurrent stroke, would show a greater benefit from oral anticoagulation for secondary stroke prevention compared with those without a history of stroke or transient ischaemic attack.

Methods

ARTESiA is a double-blind, double-dummy, randomised controlled trial conducted at 247 sites in 16 countries across Europe and North America. Adults aged 55 years or older with device-detected subclinical atrial fibrillation lasting from 6 min to 24 h and a CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score of 3 or higher were randomly assigned using an interactive web-based system to oral apixaban 5 mg twice per day or oral aspirin 81 mg once per day. The primary efficacy outcome was stroke or systemic embolism, and the primary safety outcome was major bleeding, assessed as absolute risk differences. Analyses were by intention to treat. ARTESiA is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01938248) and is completed; this report presents a prespecified subgroup analysis in people with a history of stroke or transient ischaemic attack.

Findings

Between May 7, 2015, and July 30, 2021, 4012 people with subclinical atrial fibrillation were randomly allocated either apixaban (n = 2015) or aspirin (n = 1997). A history of stroke or transient ischaemic attack was present in 346 (8·6%) participants (172 assigned to apixaban and 174 to aspirin), among whom the annual rate of stroke or systemic embolism was 1·20% (n = 7; 95% CI 0·48 to 2·48) with apixaban versus 3·14% (n = 18; 1·86 to 4·96) with aspirin; (hazard ratio [HR] 0·40, 95% CI 0·17 to 0·95). In participants without a history of stroke or transient ischaemic attack (n = 3666; 1843 assigned to apixaban and 1823 to aspirin), the annual rate of stroke or systemic embolism was 0·74% (n = 48; 95% CI 0·55 to 0·98) with apixaban versus 1·07% (n = 68; 95% CI 0·83 to 1·36) with aspirin (HR 0·69, 95% CI 0·48 to 1·00). The absolute risk difference in incidence of stroke or systemic embolism at 3·5 years of follow-up was 7% (95% CI 2 to 12) in participants with versus 1% (0 to 3) in participants without a history of stroke or transient ischaemic attack. The annual rate of major bleeding in participants with a history of stroke or transient ischaemic attack was 2·26% with apixaban (n = 13; 95% CI 1·21 to 3·87) versus 1·16% with aspirin (n = 7; 0·47 to 2·39; HR 1·94, 95% CI 0·77 to 4·87). The absolute risk difference in major bleeding events at 3·5 years was 3% (-1 to 8) in individuals with a versus 1% (-1 to 2) in those without a history of stroke or transient ischaemic attack.

Interpretation

Treatment with the direct-acting oral anticoagulant apixaban in people with subclinical atrial fibrillation and a history of stroke or transient ischaemic attack led to a 7% absolute risk reduction in stroke or systemic embolism over 3·5 years, compared with a 1% absolute risk reduction for individuals without a previous history of stroke or transient ischaemic attack. The corresponding absolute increase in major bleeding was 3% and 1%, respectively. Apixaban could be considered for secondary stroke prevention in people with subclinical atrial fibrillation and a history of stroke or transient ischaemic attack.

### Betrixaban compared with warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation: results of a phase 2, randomized, dose-ranging study (explore-Xa) [^112Vzix8]. European Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is an arrhythmia that affects an estimated 7 million people in the USA and the European Union with a median age of 75 years. The greatest risk associated with AF is ischaemic stroke resulting from embolism of thrombus from the left atrium. Guidelines recommend treatment with a vitamin K antagonist for stroke prevention in patients with AF based on the results of randomized, controlled trials comparing warfarin with placebo or no warfarin. – The use of warfarin is challenging because it has an unpredictable anticoagulant effect, a high propensity for food and drug interactions, and a risk of significant bleeding. Indeed, a recent meta-analysis of contemporary randomized clinical trials comprising over 50 000 patient-years on warfarin revealed major bleeding rates ranging from 1.4 to 3.4% per year, and are likely higher outside the confines of a clinical trial. Routine coagulation monitoring is required, which is inconvenient for patients and costly for the health care system.

Thrombin plays a key role in arterial and venous thromboses by activating platelets and facilitating the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin. Recently, dabigatran, a direct thrombin inhibitor, has been shown to be superior to warfarin for the prevention of stroke with improved ease of use; and is available in many countries. Factor Xa is also an attractive target for anticoagulant therapy as it is the enzyme responsible for the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin. Rivaroxaban and apixaban, factor Xa inhibitors, have been shown to be effective for stroke prevention in AF. –

Betrixaban is an oral, once-daily, direct factor Xa inhibitor. It is rapidly absorbed with mean peak concentrations occurring 3 to 4 h after oral administration, a pharmacodynamic half-life of 20 h and a low peak-to-trough concentration ratio over each 24 h dosing period. Oral bioavailability of an 80 mg dose is 34% and protein binding is ∼60%. Betrixaban is mostly excreted unchanged in bile, with low (17%) renal excretion. When administered immediately after a high-fat, high-calorie breakfast, C max and AUC were reduced by ∼50% compared with the fasting state. Betrixaban is a substrate for efflux proteins, including P-glycoprotein; however, it is not a substrate for major CYP enzymes.

### Patients with atrial fibrillation taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and oral anticoagulants in the ARISTOTLE trial [^112jQ1QZ]. Circulation (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) with oral anticoagulants has been associated with an increased risk of bleeding. We investigated the risk of bleeding and major cardiovascular outcomes in patients with atrial fibrillation taking NSAIDs and apixaban or warfarin.

Methods

The ARISTOTLE trial (Apixaban for Reduction in Stroke and Other Thromboembolic Events in Atrial Fibrillation; n = 18201) compared apixaban with warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation at an increased risk of stroke. Patients in ARISTOTLE without severe renal (creatine clearance ≤ 30 mL/min) or liver disease were included in this analysis (n = 17423). NSAID use at baseline, NSAID use during the trial (incident NSAID use), and never users were described. The primary outcome was major bleeding. Secondary outcomes included clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding, gastrointestinal bleeding, heart failure hospitalization, stroke or systemic embolism, and all-cause mortality. NSAID use during the trial, and the interaction between randomized treatment, was analyzed using time-dependent Cox proportional hazards models.

Results

Those with baseline NSAID use (n = 832 [4.8%]), incident NSAID use (n = 2185 [13.2%]), and never users were similar in median age (age [25th, 75th]; 70 [64, 77] versus 70 [63, 75] versus 70 [62, 76]). Those with NSAID use at baseline and incident NSAID use were more likely to have a history of bleeding than never users (24.5% versus 21.0% versus 15.6%, respectively). During a median follow-up (25th, 75th) of 1.8 (1.4, 2.3) years and when excluding those taking NSAID at baseline, we found that incident NSAID use was associated with an increased risk of major bleeding (hazard ratio [HR], 1.61 [95% CI, 1.11–2.33]) and clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding (HR, 1.70 [95% CI, 1.16–2.48]), but not gastrointestinal bleeding. No significant interaction was observed between NSAID use and randomized treatment for any outcome.

Conclusions

A substantial number of patients in the ARISTOTLE trial took NSAIDs. Incident NSAID use was associated with major and clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding, but not with gastrointestinal bleeding. The safety and efficacy of apixaban versus warfarin appeared not significantly to be altered by NSAID use. This study warrants more investigation of the effect of NSAIDs on the outcomes of patients treated with apixaban.

### Apixaban or warfarin and aspirin or placebo after acute coronary syndrome or percutaneous coronary intervention in patients with atrial fibrillation and prior stroke: a post hoc analysis from the AUGUSTUS trial [^116DfH6z]. JAMA Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Data are limited regarding the risk of cerebrovascular ischemic events and major bleeding in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and recent acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and/or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

Objective

Determine the efficacy and safety of apixaban or vitamin K antagonists (VKA) and aspirin or placebo according to prior stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), or thromboembolism (TE).

Design, Setting, and Participants

In this prospective, multicenter, 2-by-2 factorial, randomized clinical trial, post hoc parallel analyses were performed to compare randomized treatment regimens according to presence or absence of prior stroke/TIA/TE using Cox proportional hazards models. Patients with AF, recent ACS or PCI, and planned use of P2Y12 inhibitors for 6 months or longer were included; 33 patients with missing data about prior stroke/TIA/TE were excluded.

Interventions

Apixaban (5 mg or 2.5 mg twice daily) or VKA and aspirin or placebo.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Major or clinically relevant nonmajor (CRNM) bleeding.

Results

Of 4581 patients included, 633 (13.8%) had prior stroke/TIA/TE. Patients with vs without prior stroke/TIA/TE were older; had higher CHA2DS2-VASC and HAS-BLED scores; and more frequently had prior bleeding, heart failure, diabetes, and prior oral anticoagulant use. Apixaban was associated with lower rates of major or CRNM bleeding and death or hospitalization than VKA in patients with (hazard ratio [HR], 0.69; 95% CI, 0.46–1.03) and without (HR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.57–0.82) prior stroke/TIA/TE. Patients without prior stroke/TIA/TE receiving aspirin vs placebo had higher rates of bleeding; this difference appeared less substantial among patients with prior stroke/TIA/TE (P = .01 for interaction). Aspirin was associated with numerically lower rates of death or ischemic events than placebo in patients with (HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.42–1.20) and without (HR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.72–1.21) prior stroke/TIA/TE (not statistically significant).

Conclusions and Relevance

The safety and efficacy of apixaban compared with VKA was consistent with the AUGUSTUS findings, irrespective of prior stroke/TIA/TE. Aspirin increased major or CRNM bleeding, particularly in patients without prior stroke/TIA/TE. Although aspirin may have some benefit in patients with prior stroke, our findings support the use of apixaban and a P2Y12 inhibitor without aspirin for the majority of patients with AF and ACS and/or PCI, regardless of prior stroke/TIA/TE status.

### The new oral anticoagulants [^116MiCE5]. Blood (2010). Low credibility.

Although their first application in clinical practice occurred in the 1940s, vitamin K antagonists remain the only form of oral anticoagulant medication approved for long-term use. Although the available vitamin K antagonists are highly effective for the prevention and/or treatment of most thrombotic disease, the significant interpatient and intrapatient variability in dose-response, the narrow therapeutic index, and the numerous drug and dietary interactions associated with these agents have led clinicians, patients, and investigators to search for alternative agents. Three new orally administered anticoagulants (apixaban, dabigatran, and rivaroxaban) are in the late stages of development and several others are just entering (or moving through) earlier phases of investigation. These novel anticoagulant medications are being studied for the prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolism, the treatment of acute coronary syndromes and the prevention of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. This review summarizes published clinical trial data pertinent to apixaban, dabigatran, and rivaroxaban.

### Cardiovascular benefits of icosapent ethyl in patients with and without atrial fibrillation in REDUCE-IT [^1111cNiC]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Atrial fibrillation, particularly in patients with or at risk for coronary artery disease, is associated with increased risk of adverse outcomes including debilitating symptoms, worsening myocardial ischemia, stroke, heart failure, hypertension, and ultimately, death. Patients with atrial fibrillation may be at greater risk of bleeding because of oral anticoagulation prescribed to reduce thromboembolic events in these patients.

Recent meta‐analytic data suggest that omega‐3 fatty acids increase risk of atrial fibrillation, but risk appears minimal or absent in some reports. Surprisingly, some published meta‐analyses include results from REDUCE‐IT (Reduction of Cardiovascular Events With Icosapent Ethyl–Intervention Trial) that, until now, have not been reported fully. Risk of atrial fibrillation with omega‐3 fatty acids and subsequent outcomes may depend upon underlying comorbidities, specific omega‐3 formulation and dose, and concomitant medications. In selected populations, randomized controlled clinical trials of omega‐3 fatty acids have generally been unable to show benefit in reducing atrial arrhythmias, but open‐label trials suggest benefit. Even if omega‐3 fatty acids have antiarrhythmic properties, there may be additional effects on risk of thromboembolic stroke and bleeding. Some reports suggest omega‐3 fatty acids increase risk of bleeding, but data conflict.

### Association between edoxaban dose, concentration, anti-factor Xa activity, and outcomes: an analysis of data from the randomised, double-blind ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 trial [^113mcKK9]. Lancet (2015). Excellent credibility.

Background

New oral anticoagulants for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation were developed to be given in fixed doses without the need for the routine monitoring that has hindered usage and acceptance of vitamin K antagonists. A concern has emerged, however, that measurement of drug concentration or anticoagulant activity might be needed to prevent excess drug concentrations, which significantly increase bleeding risk. In the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 trial, higher-dose and lower-dose edoxaban were compared with warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation. Each regimen incorporated a 50% dose reduction in patients with clinical features known to increase edoxaban drug exposure. We aim to assess whether adjustment of edoxaban dose in this trial prevented excess drug concentration and the risk of bleeding events.

Methods

We analysed data from the randomised, double-blind ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 trial. We correlated edoxaban dose, plasma concentration, and anti-Factor Xa (FXa) activity and compared efficacy and safety outcomes with warfarin stratified by dose reduction status. Patients with atrial fibrillation and at moderate to high risk of stroke were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive warfarin, dose adjusted to an international normalised ratio of 2·0–3·0, higher-dose edoxaban (60 mg once daily), or lower-dose edoxaban (30 mg once daily). Randomisation was done with use of a central, 24 h, interactive, computerised response system. International normalised ratio was measured using an encrypted point-of-care device. To maintain masking, sham international normalised ratio values were generated for patients assigned to edoxaban. Edoxaban (or placebo-edoxaban in warfarin group) doses were halved at randomisation or during the trial if patients had creatinine clearance 30–50 mL/min, bodyweight 60 kg or less, or concomitant medication with potent P-glycoprotein interaction. Efficacy outcomes included the primary endpoint of all-cause stroke or systemic embolism, ischaemic stroke, and all-cause mortality. Safety outcomes included the primary safety endpoint of major bleeding, fatal bleeding, intracranial haemorrhage, and gastrointestinal bleeding. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00781391.

Findings

Between Nov 19, 2008 and Nov 22, 2010, 21105 patients were recruited. Patients who met clinical criteria for dose reduction at randomisation (n = 5356) had higher rates of stroke, bleeding, and death compared with those who did not have a dose reduction (n = 15749). Edoxaban dose ranged from 15 mg to 60 mg, resulting in a two-fold to three fold gradient of mean trough drug exposure (16·0–48·5 ng/mL in 6780 patients with data available) and mean trough anti-FXa activity (0·35–0·85 IU/mL in 2865 patients). Dose reduction decreased mean exposure by 29% (from 48·5 ng/mL [SD 45·8] to 34·6 ng/mL [30·9]) and 35% (from 24·5 ng/mL [22·7] to 16·0 ng/mL [14·5]) and mean anti-FXa activity by 25% (from 0·85 IU/mL [0·76] to 0·64 IU/mL [0·54]) and 20% (from 0·44 IU/mL [0·37] to 0·35 IU/mL [0·28]) in the higher-dose and lower-dose regimens, respectively. Despite the lower anti-FXa activity, dose reduction preserved the efficacy of edoxaban compared with warfarin (stroke or systemic embolic event: higher dose pinteraction = 0·85, lower dose pinteraction = 0·99) and provided even greater safety (major bleeding: higher dose pinteraction 0·02, lower dose pinteraction = 0·002).

Interpretation

These findings validate the strategy that tailoring of the dose of edoxaban on the basis of clinical factors alone achieves the dual goal of preventing excess drug concentrations and helps to optimise an individual patient's risk of ischaemic and bleeding events and show that the therapeutic window for edoxaban is narrower for major bleeding than thromboembolism.

### Rivaroxaban vs apixaban and major ischemic or hemorrhagic events in patients with AF… [^114B3Hsw]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

Findings In this retrospective cohort study that included 581 451 patients 65 years or older enrolled in Medicare with atrial fibrillation, the adjusted incidence of major ischemic or hemorrhagic events was 16. 1 per 1000 person-years for rivaroxaban vs
13. 4 per 1000 person-years for apixaban, a difference that was statistically significant. Meaning Among older adults with atrial fibrillation, treatment with rivaroxaban compared with apixaban was associated with a significantly increased risk of major ischemic or hemorrhagic events. Importance The comparative effectiveness of rivaroxaban and apixaban, the most frequently prescribed oral anticoagulants for ischemic stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation, is uncertain. Conclusions and Relevance Among Medicare beneficiaries 65 years or older with atrial fibrillation, treatment with rivaroxaban compared with apixaban was associated with a significantly increased risk of major ischemic or hemorrhagic events.

Thus, there is substantially greater peak-trough variation in rivaroxaban concentrations, 5, 8 which raises the concern that this medication may have poorer efficacy and safety. Because differences in the clinical outcomes of rivaroxaban and apixaban would have major health implications for the millions of patients with prolonged use for stroke prevention, the objective of this retrospective cohort study was to compare major ischemic and hemorrhagic outcomes in Medicare beneficiaries with atrial fibrillation who initiated anticoagulation treatment with rivaroxaban or apixaban. Quiz Ref IDIn this retrospective cohort study of Medicare beneficiaries 65 years or older with atrial fibrillation, initiation of anticoagulation treatment with rivaroxaban compared with apixaban was associated with a significantly increased risk of major ischemic or hemorrhagic events.

Although previous retrospective cohort studies have examined the comparative effectiveness of rivaroxaban and apixaban in atrial fibrillation, 15, 21, 22 the present study makes 3 distinct contributions to the evidence needed to guide clinical practice. Among Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 or older with atrial fibrillation, treatment with rivaroxaban compared with apixaban was associated with a significantly increased risk of major ischemic or hemorrhagic events.

### Relative benefit of dual versus single antiplatelet therapy among patients with atrial fibrillation on oral anticoagulation according to time after ACS and PCI: insights from the AUGUSTUS trial [^113ZzTrL]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Interventions (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

In the AUGUSTUS trial (An Open-Label, 2 x 2 Factorial, Randomized Controlled, Clinical Trial to Evaluate the Safety of Apixaban vs Vitamin K Antagonist and Aspirin vs Aspirin Placebo in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation and Acute Coronary Syndrome or Percutaneous Coronary Intervention), the combination of dual antiplatelet therapy plus oral anticoagulation increased the risk of bleeding without reducing ischemic events compared with a P2Y12 inhibitor plus oral anticoagulation among patients with atrial fibrillation and acute coronary syndrome or elective percutaneous coronary intervention. However, AUGUSTUS enrolled patients up to 14 days after acute coronary syndrome or percutaneous coronary intervention, and there may be a benefit to dual antiplatelet therapy plus oral anticoagulation early after an ischemic event.

Methods

In this secondary analysis of AUGUSTUS, we divided patients into groups based on whether they were enrolled < 6 days (early) or ≥ 6 days (later) after their index acute coronary syndrome or percutaneous coronary intervention, and tested the interaction between time from the index event to enrollment and randomized treatment (apixaban versus vitamin K antagonist and aspirin versus placebo) on 30-day and 6-month clinical outcomes using Cox proportional hazards models.

Results

Among 4605 patients enrolled in AUGUSTUS with data available on time from the index event to enrollment, the median time from the index event to enrollment was 6 (range, 0–14) days. There were no significant interactions between time from the index event and aspirin versus placebo on clinical outcomes at 30 days or 6 months, though patients with time from the index event < 6 days had a nominally significant reduction in death or ischemic events at 30 days with aspirin (hazard ratio, 0.55 [95% CI, 0.30–0.99]), whereas patients with time from the index event ≥ 6 days did not (hazard ratio, 0.88 [95% CI, 0.54–1.43]; interaction P = 0.23). There were no significant interactions between time from the index event and apixaban versus vitamin K antagonist on clinical outcomes.

Conclusions

Among patients with atrial fibrillation with acute coronary syndrome or undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention, there was no difference in the relative benefit of apixaban versus vitamin K antagonist or aspirin versus placebo when patients were enrolled early versus later after their index event.

### Effectiveness and safety of vitamin K antagonists and new anticoagulants in the prevention of thromboembolism in atrial fibrillation in older adults-a systematic review of reviews and the development of recommendations to reduce inappropriate prescribing [^115mEVob]. BMC Geriatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Atrial fibrillation is the most common arrhythmia seen in clinical practice and its prevalence increases rapidly with age. Around 9% of people aged 80 years or older are affected by atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation is associated with a fivefold higher risk for stroke and with increased mortality. In the Framingham Heart Study atrial fibrillation was the only cardiovascular condition that showed greater risk of stroke with increasing age. Anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonists (VKA) in atrial fibrillation has been the mainstay of therapy for decades to prevent stroke and systemic embolism. However, the need for regular monitoring of INR (International Normalized Ratio) and multiple drug and food interactions of VKA have led to the development of new oral anticoagulants (NOACs). NOACs are taken orally in a fixed regime once or twice daily without any need for laboratory measurements. A distinction can be made between direct thrombin inhibitors such as dabigatran, and direct factor Xa inhibitors such as rivaroxaban, apixaban and edoxaban. In the European Union in 2008 Dabigatran became the first NOAC approved for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation. Since their approval, there has been some controversy over the use of NOACs, especially in older people, while prescription rates have continuously increased.

The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) Guidelines recommend NOACs for the majority of patients with AF as NOACs were effective in preventing stroke with better safety compared to VKA. Elderly patients are at higher risk for stroke and therefore benefit from treatment with oral anticoagulation. However, concerns remain over patients with multiple comorbidities and polypharmacy as they are at higher risk for adverse drug events and drug interactions requiring dose-adjustments in this patient group. NOACs are considered potentially inappropriate medications for older people by some authors. In contrast, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines recommend the NOACs apixaban, rivaroxaban and dabigatran as equal to VKA.

The risk of major bleeding associated with use of anticoagulants remains a serious concern. Bleeding associated with warfarin is one of the main causes of adverse event related hospitalizations, with people aged 75 or older and with polypharmacy at particularly higher risk. The bleeding risk appears to be the main reason for VKA underuse in almost half of the patients with atrial fibrillation eligible for anticoagulation, and especially in older people.

Data from a population‐based cohort study from Sweden demonstrated trend toward dabigatran having less interaction than the analyzed factor Xa inhibitors with respect to bleeding outcomes. In our study, the use of direct thrombin inhibitors, as opposed to factor Xa inhibitor, was not found to be significantly associated with increased bleeding risk.

### Advantages and limitations of the new anticoagulants [^117Qf83g]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

During recent years, three new anticoagulants (dabigatran, rivaroxaban and apixaban) have been introduced to the market, probably with one more anticoagulant (edoxaban) in the next 2 years. This review is not intended to compare the efficacy and risks of these new agents, but rather to detail the advantages and limitations. The pharmacokinetic characteristics of these drugs have few drug and food interactions, predictable dose responses, and rapid onset and offset, thus resulting in simplified management of the patient requiring anticoagulant therapy. No routine laboratory monitoring is required. A somewhat unexpected, but exciting observation involving the new anticoagulants, is the uniform reduction in intracranial bleeding by one-half compared with warfarin. The potential limitations of the new anticoagulants include uncertainty regarding assessment of drug levels, safe drug levels for major surgery, management of major bleeding, renal dependence, multiple dose regimens, adherence in the absence of frequent monitoring and unknown, rare side effects that were not captured in the trials. This review should clarify some of these concerns.

7.3 Anticoagulants and Antiplatelet Agents

Coadministration of antiplatelet agents, fibrinolytics, heparin, aspirin, and chronic NSAID use increases the risk of bleeding.

APPRAISE-2, a placebo-controlled clinical trial of apixaban in high-risk, post-acute coronary syndrome patients treated with aspirin or the combination of aspirin and clopidogrel, was terminated early due to a higher rate of bleeding with apixaban compared to placebo. The rate of ISTH major bleeding was 2.8% per year with apixaban versus 0.6% per year with placebo in patients receiving single antiplatelet therapy and was 5.9% per year with apixaban versus 2.5% per year with placebo in those receiving dual antiplatelet therapy.

In ARISTOTLE, concomitant use of aspirin increased the bleeding risk on apixaban from 1.8% per year to 3.4% per year and concomitant use of aspirin and warfarin increased the bleeding risk from 2.7% per year to 4.6% per year. In this clinical trial, there was limited (2.3%) use of dual antiplatelet therapy with apixaban.

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter: Icosapent ethyl capsule was associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter requiring hospitalization in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. The incidence of atrial fibrillation was greater in patients with a previous history of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter. (5.1)

Potential for Allergic Reactions in Patients with Fish Allergy: Icosapent ethyl capsule contains ethyl esters of the omega-3 fatty acid, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), obtained from the oil of fish. It is not known whether patients with allergies to fish and/or shellfish are at increased risk of an allergic reaction to icosapent ethyl capsules. Inform patients with known hypersensitivity to fish and/or shellfish about the potential for allergic reactions and advise them to discontinue icosapent ethyl capsules and seek medical attention if any reactions occur. (5.2)

Bleeding: Icosapent ethyl capsule was associated with an increased risk of bleeding in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. The incidence of bleeding was greater in patients receiving concomitant antithrombotic medications, such as aspirin, clopidogrel, or warfarin. (5.3)

5.1 Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter

Icosapent ethyl capsules are associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter requiring hospitalization. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 8,179 subjects, adjudicated atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter requiring hospitalization for 24 or more hours occurred in 127 (3%) patients treated with icosapent ethyl capsules compared to 84 (2%) patients receiving placebo [HR = 1.5 (95% Cl 1.14, 1.98)]. The incidence of atrial fibrillation was greater in patients with a previous history of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter.

### Polypharmacy and health outcomes in atrial fibrillation: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114FveEy]. Open Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

Drug–drug and drug–disease interactions may be a contributing factor to polypharmacy-associated harm. It is possible that the observed increase in bleeding risk may reflect an increased likelihood of combining certain high-risk medications with anticoagulants. Many commonly used agents have potential interactions with anticoagulants including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), antiplatelet agents or others with antiplatelet effects including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Post hoc analyses of the Dabigatran versus Warfarin in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation (RE-LY) studydemonstrated that use of NSAIDs was associated with an increased risk of major bleeding, stroke or systemic embolism and all-cause hospitalisations. In the Apixaban versus Warfarin in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation (ARISTOTLE) post hoc analysis, aspirin, NSAIDs or prednisone was used by 13.8% in those taking 0–5 medications, 31.7% taking 6–8 and 49.7% taking ≥ 9 medications. The risk of drug–drug interactions increases with growing numbers of medicines prescribed, with the risk identified to be as high as 82% in individuals prescribed seven or more medicines. Many of these interactions may be under-recognised by clinicians and possibly result in further use of medicines to treat ADRs. Compounding this situation, current guidelines are often single disease focused, with little advice for clinicians concerning management of the comorbid individual, and the potential for interactions with drug therapy for other conditions. The use of over-the-counter medicines is also under-recognised, with the risk of potentially unknown adverse interactions. A study of 250 individuals attending an anticoagulation clinic in Denmark demonstrated that almost 50% of individuals were taking alternative medicines including fish oil, and some with potential for interactions with warfarin. More research is needed to investigate whether adverse bleeding outcomes in patients with AF using polypharmacy are associated with certain drug–disease interactions or combinations of pharmacotherapy.

### Fish oil administration in older adults: is there potential for adverse events? A systematic review of the literature [^111WUSkN]. BMC Geriatrics (2013). Low credibility.

The potential for undesirable anticoagulant effects with the concurrent use of fish oil and anticoagulant or antiplatelet medications have previously been highlighted. It is speculated that older adults in particular may have an increased risk of major bleeding due to increased sensitivity to anticoagulation, multiple comorbidites and polypharmacy. However, evaluation of the evidence concerning the safety considerations associated with n-3 supplementation shows little support of an increase risk in bleeding with n-3 intake, even when concurrently administered with anticoagulant agents. Despite this Bays 2007 suggested it would be prudent to discontinue high doses of n-3 fatty acid supplementation in the days prior to invasive surgical procedures or in patients at high risk for haemorrhagic stroke. Expert opinion by Harris 2007 was also in agreement suggesting that n-3 fatty acid supplementation does not increase the risk for clinically significant bleeding with the proposed cardiovascular benefits outweighing the theoretical risks for increased bleeding. In the present review only four of ten studies excluded participants at study entry medicated with oral anticoagulant or antiplatelets despite the theoretical potential for anticoagulation of n-3 fatty acids. Regardless of the previous speculation, current evidence has shown that n-3 supplementation at doses ≤ 4 g per day, even when concurrently administered with antiplatelet or anticoagulant medications, are safe for general consumption. However, the doses of n-3 fatty acids in the present review were considerably smaller compared with those previously reported suggesting caution may need to be applied when administering higher doses until further evidence is obtained. Although the majority of studies in the present review (8/10 studies) indicated compliance toward the n-3 intervention, a dose–response relationship between n-3 intake and the potential for AE is unclear given the uncertainty associated with the exact quantity of EPA/DHA ingested in the majority of studies.

### Efficacy and safety of apixaban compared with warfarin according to age for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation: observations from the ARISTOTLE trial [^115e6ovr]. European Heart Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

The prevalence of atrial fibrillation (AF) increases with age, from ∼0.5% at 40–50 years, to ∼10% or more at 80 years. Patients with AF are at increased risk of stroke, and the annual stroke risk in AF patients is increasing with age. Warfarin and other vitamin K antagonists are effective treatments, reducing the risk of stroke by about two-thirds, but their use is limited by a narrow therapeutic range, drug and food interactions, the need for coagulation monitoring, and the risk of bleeding. The risk of bleeding including intracranial haemorrhage (ICH) increases with age, and as such is a variable in the HASBLED bleeding risk score (assigning one point each for hypertension, abnormal renal/liver function, stroke, bleeding history or predisposition, labile international normalized ratio (INR), elderly > 65 years, drugs/alcohol concomitantly). These limitations contribute to the underuse of warfarin in AF patients, observed particularly in the older age group. Recently, compared with warfarin, novel oral anticoagulants have been shown to be at least as good at reducing stroke and result in lower rate of ICH, with less drug and food interactions and no need for coagulation monitoring.

The Apixaban for Reduction in Stroke and Other Thromboembolic Events in Atrial Fibrillation (ARISTOTLE) trial compared apixaban (a novel oral direct factor Xa inhibitor) with warfarin for the prevention of stroke or systemic embolism in patients with AF and at least one additional risk factor for stroke. The study demonstrated that apixaban 5 mg twice daily compared with warfarin was associated with a lower risk of stroke or systemic embolism, caused less bleeding including ICH, and resulted in lower mortality. In this pre-specified subgroup analysis of the ARISTOTLE trial, we assessed the efficacy and safety of apixaban compared with warfarin according to age.

### Clinical outcomes of apixaban treatment in atrial fibrillation… [^115tq9Y3]. JAMA Network (2016). Excellent credibility.

Results Of the patients with 1 or no dose-reduction criteria assigned to receive the 5 mg twice daily dose of apixaban or warfarin, 3966 had 1 dose-reduction criterion; these patients had higher rates of stroke or systemic embolism and major bleeding compared with those with no dose-reduction criteria. We evaluated annualized event rates of stroke or systemic embolism and major bleeding and derived hazard ratios and 95% CIs from Cox proportional hazards models. Analyses of bleeding outcomes included only events occurring during study drug treatment, whereas stroke or systemic embolism and other efficacy outcomes were analyzed using intention-to-treat methods. The effects of the 5 mg twice daily dose of apixaban compared with warfarin on the risk of major bleeding across the range of age, weight, creatinine level, and creatinine clearance observed in the ARISTOTLE population are shown in Figure 2.

Apixaban was consistently associated with a numerically lower risk of major bleeding than warfarin across the spectrum of age, weight, creatinine level, and creatinine clearance. Patients with AF and 1 apixaban dose-reduction criterion — 80 years or older, weight 60 kg or less, and creatinine level 1. 5 mg/dL or higher — had more bleeding and thromboembolic events during follow-up than patients without these dose-reduction criteria. In patients with 1 or no dose-reduction criteria, the 5 mg twice daily dose of apixaban compared with warfarin resulted in similar benefits with respect to stroke or systemic embolism, major bleeding, and intracranial hemorrhage. Although these same criteria predict risk of bleeding and stroke, the dose-reduction criteria used in the ARISTOTLE trial were chosen because, particularly in combination, they predict increased apixaban exposure based on pharmacokinetic modeling.

6–8 Patients in the ARISTOTLE trial with 2 or 3 dose-reduction criteria were assigned to the 2. 5 mg twice daily dose of apixaban to minimize the potential for higher exposures in a population that may be at increased risk for bleeding.

### Antithrombotic therapy for stroke prevention in non-valvular atrial fibrillation [^112rFYqC]. The Lancet: Neurology (2012). Medium credibility.

The world faces an epidemic of atrial fibrillation and atrial fibrillation-related stroke. An individual's risk of atrial fibrillation-related stroke can be estimated with the CHADS(2) or CHA(2)DS(2)VASc scores, and reduced by two-thirds with effective anticoagulation. Vitamin K antagonists, such as warfarin, are underused and often poorly managed. The direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran etexilate and factor Xa inhibitors rivaroxaban and apixaban are new oral anticoagulants that are at least as efficacious and safe as warfarin. Their advantages are predictable anticoagulant effects, low propensity for drug interactions, and lower rates of intracranial haemorrhage than with warfarin. A disadvantage is the continuing need to develop and validate rapidly effective antidotes for major bleeding and standardised tests that accurately measure plasma concentrations and anticoagulant effects, together with the disadvantage of possible higher rates of gastrointestinal haemorrhage and greater expense than with warfarin. The new oral anticoagulants should increase the number of patients with atrial fibrillation at risk of stroke who are optimally anticoagulated, and reduce the burden of atrial fibrillation-related stroke.

### 2023 ACC / AHA / ACCP / HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^117CMVg2]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation — recommendations for managing anticoagulants emphasize interaction management, appropriate warfarin intensity, and avoiding off‑label DOAC dosing: For patients with AF receiving direct oral anticoagulants, optimal management of drug interactions is recommended for those on concomitant interacting drugs; for patients with AF receiving warfarin, a target international normalized ratio (INR) between 2 and 3 is recommended along with interaction management, consistent vitamin K intake, and routine INR monitoring to improve time in therapeutic range and minimize preventable thromboembolism or major bleeding; for patients with AF, non–evidence‑based doses of DOACs should be avoided to minimize preventable thromboembolism or major bleeding and to improve survival.

### Antithrombotic therapy after acute coronary syndrome or PCI in atrial fibrillation [^112u7qNP]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2019). Excellent credibility.

Background

Appropriate antithrombotic regimens for patients with atrial fibrillation who have an acute coronary syndrome or have undergone percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) are unclear.

Methods

In an international trial with a two-by-two factorial design, we randomly assigned patients with atrial fibrillation who had an acute coronary syndrome or had undergone PCI and were planning to take a P2Y 12 inhibitor to receive apixaban or a vitamin K antagonist and to receive aspirin or matching placebo for 6 months. The primary outcome was major or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding. Secondary outcomes included death or hospitalization and a composite of ischemic events.

Results

Enrollment included 4614 patients from 33 countries. There were no significant interactions between the two randomization factors on the primary or secondary outcomes. Major or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding was noted in 10.5% of the patients receiving apixaban, as compared with 14.7% of those receiving a vitamin K antagonist (hazard ratio, 0.69; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.58 to 0.81; P < 0.001 for both noninferiority and superiority), and in 16.1% of the patients receiving aspirin, as compared with 9.0% of those receiving placebo (hazard ratio, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.59 to 2.24; P < 0.001). Patients in the apixaban group had a lower incidence of death or hospitalization than those in the vitamin K antagonist group (23.5% vs. 27.4%; hazard ratio, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.74 to 0.93; P = 0.002) and a similar incidence of ischemic events. Patients in the aspirin group had an incidence of death or hospitalization and of ischemic events that was similar to that in the placebo group.

Conclusions

In patients with atrial fibrillation and a recent acute coronary syndrome or PCI treated with a P2Y 12 inhibitor, an antithrombotic regimen that included apixaban, without aspirin, resulted in less bleeding and fewer hospitalizations without significant differences in the incidence of ischemic events than regimens that included a vitamin K antagonist, aspirin, or both.

### Individualized approaches to thromboprophylaxis in atrial fibrillation [^117Si81W]. American Heart Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia worldwide. The prevalence of AF in persons older than 55 years is at least 33.5 million globally and is predicted to more than double in the next half-century. Anticoagulation, heart rate control, and heart rhythm control comprise the 3 main treatment strategies in AF. Anticoagulation is aimed at preventing debilitating stroke, systemic embolism, and associated mortality. Historically, anticoagulation in AF was achieved with a vitamin K antagonist such as warfarin, which is supported by evidence demonstrating reduced incident stroke and all-cause mortality. However, warfarin has unpredictable pharmacokinetics with many drug-drug interactions that require regular monitoring to ensure patients remain in the therapeutic anticoagulant range. Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants including dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban provide a possible solution to these issues with their more predictable pharmacokinetics, rapid onset of action, and greater specificity. Results from large randomized, controlled trials indicate that these agents are at least noninferior to warfarin in prevention of stroke. These trials also demonstrate a consistently lower incidence of intracranial hemorrhage, almost always all life-threatening bleeds, and many forms of major bleeds with the possible exception of gastrointestinal and some other forms of mucosal bleeding, compared with warfarin. Patients with AF are a heterogeneous population with diverse risk of stroke and bleeding, and different subgroups respond differently to anticoagulation. Important clinical questions have arisen regarding optimal anticoagulation drug selection in distinct populations such as those with renal impairment, older age, coronary artery disease, and heart failure as well as those at particularly high risk for bleeding or thromboembolism. In this review, treatment strategies in AF management are discussed in the context of different individual subgroups of patients.

### Apixaban in comparison with warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation and valvular heart disease: findings from the apixaban for reduction in stroke and other thromboembolic events in atrial fibrillation (ARISTOTLE) trial [^111h7eCe]. Circulation (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Apixaban is approved for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. However, the Apixaban for Reduction in Stroke and Other Thromboembolic Events in Atrial Fibrillation (ARISTOTLE) trial included a substantial number of patients with valvular heart disease and only excluded patients with clinically significant mitral stenosis or mechanical prosthetic heart valves.

Methods and Results

We compared the effect of apixaban and warfarin on rates of stroke or systemic embolism, major bleeding, and death in patients with and without moderate or severe valvular heart disease using Cox proportional hazards modeling. Of the 18201 patients enrolled in ARISTOTLE, 4808 (26.4%) had a history of moderate or severe valvular heart disease or previous valve surgery. Patients with valvular heart disease had higher rates of stroke or systemic embolism and bleeding than patients without valvular heart disease. There was no evidence of a differential effect of apixaban over warfarin in patients with and without valvular heart disease in reducing stroke and systemic embolism (hazard ratio [HR], 0.70; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.51–0.97 and HR, 0.84; 95%, CI 0.67–1.04; interaction P = 0.38), causing less major bleeding (HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.61–1.04 and HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.55–0.77; interaction P = 0.23), and reducing mortality (HR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.84–1.22 and HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.73–0.96; interaction P = 0.10).

Conclusions

More than a quarter of the patients in ARISTOTLE with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation had moderate or severe valvular heart disease. There was no evidence of a differential effect of apixaban over warfarin in reducing stroke or systemic embolism, causing less bleeding, and reducing death in patients with and without valvular heart disease.

### Asundexian versus apixaban in patients with atrial fibrillation [^111idcHj]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

The study OCEANIC-AF was published by Jonathan P Piccini and colleagues in 2025 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Atrial fibrillation. In the OCEANIC-AF study, the trial question was: what is the effect of asundexian in patients with AF at risk of stroke? In the OCEANIC-AF study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the OCEANIC-AF study, the population was: 14810 patients (5214 female, 9596 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with AF at risk of stroke. The key exclusion criteria were mechanical heart valve prosthesis; moderate-to-severe MS; AF due to reversible causes; recent AIS; active bleeding, chronic bleeding disorder, or history of non-traumatic ICH; significant liver disease. In the OCEANIC-AF study, the interventions were: n = 7415 asundexian (at an oral dose of 50 mg daily) n = 7395 apixaban (at an oral dose of 5 mg BID). In the OCEANIC-AF study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in stroke or systemic embolism (1.3% vs. 0.4%; HR 3.79, 95% CI 2.46 to 5.83). In the OCEANIC-AF study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in AIS or systemic embolism (1.3% vs. 0.3%; HR 4.38, 95% CI 2.76 to 6.96) No significant difference in death from any cause (0.8% vs. 1%; HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.6 to 1.19) Significant increase in AIS (1.1% vs. 0.3%; HR 4.06, 95% CI 2.52 to 6.54). In the OCEANIC-AF study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in adverse events. significant difference in major bleeding (0.2% vs. 0.7%). In the OCEANIC-AF study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with AF at risk of stroke, asundexian was inferior to apixaban with respect to stroke or systemic embolism.

### 2023 ACC / AHA / ACCP / HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^116xQZ8f]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation — warfarin selection, INR targets, and interaction-related bleeding risk: Warfarin remains the preferred agent in patients with AF receiving CYP3A4/glycoprotein– inducing agents, or moderate-severe mitral stenosis or mechanical heart valve, and the optimal INR control, with a therapeutic INR goal of 2 to 3, needs to be achieved through drug–drug interaction management, vitamin K dietary education, and routine INR monitoring. Time in therapeutic INR range showed negative correlation with risks of thromboembolism (R, −0.59; P = 0.01) and major bleeding (R, −0.59; P = 0.002); a weekly vitamin K dietary modification achieved a therapeutic INR more frequently than a conventional group (74 versus 58%; P = 0.04) at 90 days; and concomitant use of APT (OR, 1.74 [95% CI, 1.56–1.94]), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (OR, 1.83 [95% CI, 1.29–2.59]), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (OR, 1.62 [95% CI, 1.42–1.85]), or antimicrobial agents (OR, 1.63 [95% CI, 1.45–1.83]) was significantly associated with higher risks of clinically relevant bleeding.

### Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic drug interactions with new oral anticoagulants: what do they mean for patients with atrial fibrillation? [^114esmVU]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To review pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic drug-drug interactions (DDIs) involving new oral anticoagulants for atrial fibrillation.

Data Sources

A literature search was conducted via PubMed and the Cochrane database to identify DDI studies using the terms drug interactions, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban. Prescribing information and Food and Drug Administration briefing documents were used to supplement published data.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

English publications identified on Medline from 2005 up to August 2013 and US prescribing information for approved oral anticoagulants.

Data Synthesis

Articles reviewed focused on drugs affecting the permeability glycoprotein (P-gp) efflux transporter protein and/or cytochrome P (CYP) 450 3A4 enzymes, and pharmacodynamic DDIs when drugs are administered concomitantly. Phase I DDI studies have reported pharmacokinetic DDIs mediated by P-gp alone (dabigatran etexilate) or in combination with CYP3A4 enzymes (rivaroxaban and apixaban). Dabigatran etexilate should not be administered with any P-gp inhibitor in patients with severe renal impairment. Briefing documents indicate that rivaroxaban and apixaban should not be used with drugs that are strong inhibitors of both P-gp and CYP3A4. DDI studies involving rifampicin suggest that rivaroxaban and apixaban should be avoided when strong inducers of P-gp and CYP3A4 are used concurrently. Concomitant use of apixaban and strong dual inhibitors of P-gp and CYP3A4 should be avoided or the dose reduced. Five randomized clinical trials report additive effects with rivaroxaban, dabigatran, and apixaban when used concomitantly with antiplatelet agents; bleeding rates have been found to be higher, especially with dual antiplatelet therapy.

Conclusions

Awareness of drugs that alter the function of the P-gp efflux transporter protein and CYP3A4 enzymes and provide additive effects should enable prescribers to anticipate and avoid potential DDIs involving the new oral anticoagulants. To this end, briefing documents and prescribing information have applied cautionary measures for individuals treated with these newer anticoagulants.

### Clinical outcomes and management associated with major bleeding in patients with atrial fibrillation treated with apixaban or warfarin: insights from the ARISTOTLE trial [^1128maZn]. European Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Aim

In the Apixaban for Reduction in Stroke and Other Thromboembolic Events in Atrial Fibrillation (ARISTOTLE) trial, apixaban compared with warfarin reduced the risk of stroke, major bleed, and death in patients with atrial fibrillation. In this ancillary study, we evaluated clinical consequences of major bleeds, as well as management and treatment effects of warfarin vs. apixaban.

Methods and Results

Major International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis bleeding was defined as overt bleeding accompanied by a decrease in haemoglobin (Hb) of ≥ 2 g/dL or transfusion of ≥ 2 units of packed red cells, occurring at a critical site or resulting in death. Time to event [death, ischaemic stroke, or myocardial infarction (MI)] was evaluated by Cox regression models. The excess risk associated with bleeding was evaluated by separate time-dependent indicators for intracranial (ICH) and non-intracranial haemorrhage. Major bleeding occurred in 848 individuals (4.7%), of whom 126 (14.9%) died within 30 days. Of 176 patients with an ICH, 76 (43.2%) died, and of the 695 patients with major non-ICH, 64 (9.2%) died within 30 days of the bleeding. The risk of death, ischaemic stroke, or MI was increased roughly 12-fold after a major non-ICH bleeding event within 30 days. Corresponding risk of death following an ICH was markedly increased, with HR 121.5 (95% CI 91.3–161.8) as was stroke or MI with HR 21.95 (95% CI 9.88–48.81), respectively. Among patients with major bleeds, 20.8% received vitamin K and/or related medications (fresh frozen plasma, coagulation factors, factor VIIa) to stop bleeding within 3 days, and 37% received blood transfusion. There was no interaction between apixaban and warfarin and major bleeding on the risk of death, stroke, or MI.

Conclusion

Major bleeding was associated with substantially increased risk of death, ischaemic stroke, or MI, especially following ICH, and this risk was similarly elevated regardless of treatment with apixaban or warfarin. These results underscore the importance of preventing bleeding in anti-coagulated patients. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00412984.

### Bleeding during treatment with aspirin versus apixaban in patients with atrial fibrillation unsuitable for warfarin: the apixaban versus acetylsalicylic acid to prevent stroke in atrial fibrillation patients who have failed or are unsuitable for vitamin K antagonist treatment (AVERROES) trial [^114pWCvP]. Stroke (2012). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Apixaban reduces stroke with comparable bleeding risks when compared with aspirin in patients with atrial fibrillation who are unsuitable for vitamin k antagonist therapy. This analysis explores patterns of bleeding and defines bleeding risks based on stroke risk with apixaban and aspirin.

Methods

The Apixaban versus Acetylsalicylic Acid to Prevent Stroke in Atrial Fibrillation Patients Who Have Failed or Are Unsuitable for Vitamin k Antagonist Treatment (AVERROES) trial randomized 5599 patients with atrial fibrillation and risk factors to receive either apixaban or aspirin. Bleeding events were defined as the first occurrence of either major bleeding or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding.

Results

The rate of a bleeding event was 3.8%/year with aspirin and 4.5%/year with apixaban (hazard ratio with apixaban, 1.18; 95% CI, 0.92–1.51; P = 0.19). The anatomic site of bleeding did not differ between therapies. Risk factors for bleeding common to apixaban and aspirin were use of nonstudy aspirin > 50% of the time and a history of daily/occasional nosebleeds. The rates of both stroke and bleeding increased with higher CHADS2 scores but apixaban compared with aspirin was associated with a similar relative risk of bleeding (P interaction 0.21) and a reduced relative risk of stroke (P interaction 0.37) irrespective of CHADS2 category.

Conclusions

Anatomic sites and predictors of bleeding are similar for apixaban and aspirin in these patients. Higher CHADS2 scores are associated with increasing rates of bleeding and stroke, but the balance between risks and benefits of apixaban compared with aspirin is favorable irrespective of baseline stroke risk.

### Apixaban [^1127ibQB]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Increased Risk of Thrombotic Events after Premature Discontinuation

Premature discontinuation of any oral anticoagulant, including apixaban tablets, in the absence of adequate alternative anticoagulation increases the risk of thrombotic events. An increased rate of stroke was observed during the transition from apixaban tablets to warfarin in clinical trials in atrial fibrillation patients. If apixaban tablets is discontinued for a reason other than pathological bleeding or completion of a course of therapy, consider coverage with another anticoagulant [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Clinical Studies (14.1)].

### New antithrombotic agents – insights from clinical trials [^111seCFX]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2010). Medium credibility.

Antithrombotic agents are the cornerstones of therapy for thrombosis. The compositions of arterial and venous clots differ, rendering antiplatelet agents more effective for arterial thrombosis and anticoagulants more effective for venous disease. Despite taking acetylsalicylic acid, some patients with arterial disease experience thrombotic events. The addition of the ADP-receptor antagonist clopidogrel to therapeutic regimens containing acetylsalicylic acid improves outcomes in patients with acute coronary syndromes and in those undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. However, clopidogrel has several limitations, including variable absorption, drug-drug interactions and genetic factors that lead to reduced generation of the active metabolite, and a delayed onset and offset of action. A search for new ADP-receptor inhibitors has yielded drugs such as prasugrel, ticagrelor, and cangrelor. For patients with venous thrombosis, the coumarins have been the only available oral anticoagulants for more than 60 years. Despite their effectiveness in preventing and treating thromboembolism, coumarins have well-documented limitations, including drug-drug and drug-dietary interactions, a narrow therapeutic range, and inconvenience and cost of monitoring therapy. A search for new oral anticoagulants has yielded drugs such as dabigatran etexilate, rivaroxaban, and apixaban. In this article, we review these new antithrombotic agents and provide plausible explanations for the results of phase III randomized controlled trials of these drugs.

### Icosapent ethyl (Vascepa) [^114Mwqzx]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.1 Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter

VASCEPA is associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter requiring hospitalization. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 8,179 statin-treated subjects with established cardiovascular disease (CVD) or diabetes plus an additional risk factor for CVD, adjudicated atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter requiring hospitalization for 24 or more hours occurred in 127 (3%) patients treated with VASCEPA compared to 84 (2%) patients receiving placebo [HR = 1.5 (95% CI 1.14, 1.98)]. The incidence of atrial fibrillation was greater in patients with a previous history of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter.

5.2 Potential for Allergic Reactions in Patients with Fish Allergy

VASCEPA contains ethyl esters of the omega-3 fatty acid, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), obtained from the oil of fish. It is not known whether patients with allergies to fish and/or shellfish are at increased risk of an allergic reaction to VASCEPA. Inform patients with known hypersensitivity to fish and/or shellfish about the potential for allergic reactions to VASCEPA and advise them to discontinue VASCEPA and seek medical attention if any reactions occur.

5.3 Bleeding

VASCEPA is associated with an increased risk of bleeding. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled cardiovascular outcomes trial of 8,179 patients, 482 (12%) patients receiving VASCEPA experienced a bleeding event compared to 404 (10%) patients receiving placebo. Serious bleeding events occurred in 111 (3%) of patients on VASCEPA vs. 85 (2%) of patients receiving placebo. The incidence of bleeding was greater in patients receiving concomitant antithrombotic medications, such as aspirin, clopidogrel, or warfarin.

### New anticoagulants for prevention of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation [^1171akce]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2011). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac rhythm disorder and a major risk factor for ischemic stroke. Antithrombotic therapy using vitamin K antagonists (VKA) is currently prescribed for prevention of ischemic stroke in patients with AF. A narrow therapeutic range and frequent food and drug interactions underly the need for regular monitoring of anticoagulation intensity and impairs the utility and safety of VKA, stimulating a quest for alternative anticoagulant agents. Recently developed anticoagulants include the direct thrombin inhibitor, dabigatran, and the factor Xa inhibitors rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, to name those in the most advanced stages of clinical development. This review focuses on advances in the development of novel antithrombotic agents to provide practical information to clinicians on the use of these new drugs in patients with AF.
