## Question

how do you rule out active tb

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to rule out active tuberculosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about pre-test probability and clinical context. Then, I should verify symptom triage and imaging triggers. Next, I will review the role of NAAT as the initial diagnostic test and how to interpret negative results against clinical suspicion. After that, I need to check asymptomatic screening pathways before LTBI testing, consider special populations, and finally confirm documentation, follow-up, and the conditions under which active TB can be considered ruled out [^113TaV49] [^111XyQsn] [^1177QJon] [^1128VtaR].

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and pre-test probability because this drives post-test interpretation; the approach differs for symptomatic patients being evaluated diagnostically versus asymptomatic individuals in whom we must exclude active disease before LTBI testing or treatment, with risk shaped by exposure, epidemiology, HIV, and immunosuppression, and the WHO-aligned Four Symptom Screen is a pragmatic starting triage tool to set the path forward [^113kZ1tH] [^113TaV49] [^1128VtaR].

> Wait, let me verify the initial triage step so I don't jump to conclusions: systematic assessment of cough, fever, weight loss, and night sweats is essential, and although the absence of all four symptoms lowers the likelihood of active TB in HIV-negative persons, it cannot fully exclude subclinical disease, while an abnormal CXR should trigger diagnostic testing even without symptoms; I should also document risk factors such as HIV, immunosuppression, recent exposure, and high-burden setting residence as they recalibrate pre-test probability and downstream thresholds [^113kZ1tH] [^1177QJon] [^113TaV49] [^112LjwLh].

> I will now examine imaging because I need to ensure I trigger bacteriologic testing appropriately; chest radiography is the first-line imaging study in suspected pulmonary TB, with CT considered if the CXR is non-revealing yet suspicion remains, and I must remember that in HIV-positive patients radiographic sensitivity can be reduced so a normal CXR does not exclude disease when clinical risk is high [^115atxPC] [^113kZ1tH].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of NAAT as the initial diagnostic test and avoid an error here: WHO strongly recommends Xpert MTB/RIF or Ultra as the initial test in adults with signs, symptoms, or an abnormal CXR, and in children across multiple specimen types including sputum, gastric aspirate, nasopharyngeal aspirate, or stool, but I must not misstate this as "instead of culture" because culture remains crucial for confirmation and drug susceptibility even though NAAT is first-line for rapid detection; a negative NAAT does not definitively exclude TB, particularly in paucibacillary disease and in children or people living with HIV, so I should plan for repeat NAAT or culture when suspicion persists [^113TaV49] [^111XyQsn] [^115mG3qM] [^1139pGZL] [^1133fvYB].

> Next, I should review how to reconcile test results with clinical suspicion so I don't get falsely reassured by a single negative NAAT; when pre-test probability is high, I need to obtain mycobacterial culture on respiratory specimens because culture remains the definitive reference for exclusion and drug susceptibility testing, consider repeating NAAT, and escalate to chest CT or evaluate for extrapulmonary disease with site-specific sampling for AFB smear, NAAT, and culture if the presentation suggests EPTB, especially since smear- and culture-negative TB can occur [^1177QJon] [^1133fvYB] [^1174Uuq2] [^115atxPC] [^115raUpR] [^114bT1Xi].

> Let me think about the asymptomatic screening pathway, because I need to ensure I exclude active TB before LTBI testing or treatment; in at-risk but asymptomatic individuals, a negative Four Symptom Screen plus a normal CXR generally suffices to exclude active TB and proceed with LTBI testing (IGRA or TST) per WHO, USPSTF, and CDC/NTCA guidance, and if symptoms or CXR abnormalities are present, I should not initiate LTBI therapy but revert to the diagnostic algorithm with NAAT-based testing [^111ibrxd] [^114FQHQk] [^117PdHD8] [^113imv8J] [^1128VtaR] [^1169veSK].

> But wait, special populations require modified thresholds, so I should double-check my approach: for people living with HIV, current WHO guidance advises against urine LAM testing in asymptomatic outpatients or those with CD4 counts ≥ 200, reserving LAM for selected symptomatic or severely immunosuppressed patients, and recommends a low threshold for sputum NAAT and consideration of CRP and CXR in screening; in suspected disseminated disease in HIV, Xpert is recommended as an initial diagnostic tool, and for young children, I should prioritize TST for LTBI screening and use induced sputum, gastric aspirates, or stool for NAAT and culture if active disease is suspected; for extrapulmonary disease, site-directed sampling with AFB smear, NAAT, culture, and histopathology is key because IGRAs cannot distinguish active from latent infection [^111csCWg] [^111qqcEm] [^111rQHnU] [^116LPTnW] [^1154UCn5] [^1133fvYB] [^1139pGZL] [^114bT1Xi] [^115raUpR] [^111Ex5Ty].

> I should confirm documentation and follow-up because ruling out TB is a probabilistic judgment, not a single-test binary; guidelines emphasize careful note of symptoms, imaging, NAAT and culture results, pre-test probability, and contingency plans with return precautions, while acknowledging the risks of both false negatives and false positives in broader screening programs, so arranging reassessment in 2–4 weeks for high-risk patients with persistent symptoms and normal initial workup can be prudent, sometimes with repeat imaging if warranted [^1177QJon] [^112ziBqJ] [^115atxPC].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I should explicitly state when active TB can be considered ruled out to avoid ambiguity: in symptomatic patients with adequate respiratory or site-specific specimens, when NAAT and cultures are negative, imaging is non-contributory, and the patient improves without TB treatment or an alternative diagnosis is established, the probability is sufficiently low to rule out disease in most settings; in asymptomatic at-risk patients, a negative Four Symptom Screen plus normal CXR allows proceeding with LTBI testing without sputum diagnostics; across all contexts, I need to remember that no single negative test is definitive, so negative predictive value is maximized when NAAT, culture, and imaging are all negative and the pre-test probability is low, which I should always verify against the patient's risk profile and local epidemiology before closing the case [^1177QJon] [^113TaV49] [^111ibrxd] [^113imv8J] [^115atxPC].

> Hold on, I should verify one earlier potential misstatement and correct it clearly: while I initially echoed that NAAT is recommended "instead of culture" for initial testing, culture remains essential as the gold standard for definitive exclusion and drug susceptibility even when NAAT is used first-line, so my final algorithm maintains NAAT as the initial rapid test, followed by culture whenever suspicion persists, drug resistance is a concern, or a definitive rule-out is required by context [^113TaV49] [^1177QJon] [^111yd8yP].

---

To rule out active tuberculosis (TB), use a stepwise approach: **clinical assessment** (symptoms, risk factors), **chest radiography** (CXR) [^1177QJon], and **microbiological testing** (sputum smear, culture, NAAT) [^113TaV49]. A negative NAAT [^111XyQsn] plus negative culture on two high-quality sputum samples, with a normal CXR and no symptoms, **effectively excludes active TB**. In immunocompromised or high-risk patients, add urine LAM [^111qqcEm], CT [^115atxPC], or bronchoscopy as needed [^1177QJon]. TST/IGRA [^1177QJon] are **not used** to rule out active TB [^111Ex5Ty]. If suspicion remains despite negative tests, **repeat or escalate testing** and monitor closely.

---

## Clinical assessment

Clinical assessment focuses on **symptoms** such as cough ≥ 2 weeks [^115pTAzg], hemoptysis, fever, night sweats [^1177QJon], weight loss, fatigue, chest pain, and dyspnea. It also assesses **risk factors**, including recent exposure, prior TB, immunosuppression (HIV, diabetes, corticosteroids, anti-TNF) [^1177QJon], incarceration, homelessness [^113imv8J], and travel to high-burden areas.

---

## Radiological evaluation

Radiological evaluation begins with **chest radiography** as the **first-line** test [^1177QJon]; a normal CXR without symptoms makes active TB unlikely [^111XhvVT]. Chest **CT** is indicated if the CXR is nondiagnostic [^115atxPC] or suspicion remains high.

---

## Microbiological testing

### Sputum smear microscopy

Sputum smear microscopy (AFB smear) provides rapid results but is insensitive [^1177QJon]; a negative smear **does not exclude active TB** [^113TaV49].

---

### Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs)

Nucleic acid amplification tests, such as Xpert MTB/RIF or Xpert Ultra [^1139pGZL], are the **preferred initial tests** for their high sensitivity, specificity, and rapid results [^111XyQsn]. If the initial NAAT is negative but suspicion remains, repeat testing [^1133fvYB] to a total of two tests is recommended.

---

### Mycobacterial culture

Mycobacterial culture is the **diagnostic gold standard** [^1177QJon]; negative cultures from two high-quality sputum samples strongly suggest no active TB.

---

## Special considerations

### Immunocompromised patients

In immunocompromised patients, **urine LAM** should be considered for HIV-positive individuals with CD4 < 100 [^111qqcEm] or serious illness. Use **bronchoscopy** if sputum is unobtainable or suspicion remains high [^1177QJon].

---

### Extrapulmonary tuberculosis

For extrapulmonary tuberculosis, obtain **site-specific samples** for NAAT [^114bT1Xi] and culture.

---

## Role of TST and IGRA

TST and IGRA **detect latent infection** [^1177QJon] and are not used to rule out active TB [^116mwske].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

If clinical suspicion persists, **repeat or escalate testing** and **monitor closely** [^1133fvYB] [^115atxPC].

---

## Summary of diagnostic algorithm

| **Step** | **Diagnostic tool** | **Interpretation** |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | Clinical assessment | No symptoms = unlikely active TB [^111XhvVT] |
| 2 | Chest radiography | Normal CXR = unlikely active TB [^1177QJon] |
| 3 | Sputum smear microscopy | Negative smear = does not exclude TB [^113TaV49] |
| 4 | NAAT (Xpert MTB/RIF) | Negative NAAT = unlikely active TB [^1139pGZL] |
| 5 | Mycobacterial culture | Negative culture = no active TB |
| 6 | Special tests (LAM, bronchoscopy) | Use if immunocompromised or extrapulmonary TB suspected [^111qqcEm] [^114bT1Xi] |

---

To rule out active TB, combine clinical assessment, radiology, and microbiology [^1177QJon]; a negative NAAT [^111XyQsn] plus negative cultures from two high-quality sputum samples, with a normal CXR and no symptoms, **effectively excludes active TB**. Use additional tests in high-risk patients [^111qqcEm], and do not rely on TST/IGRA for this purpose [^116mwske].

Individuals infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) may develop symptoms and signs of disease (tuberculosis disease) or may have no clinical evidence of disease (latent tuberculosis infection [LTBI]). Tuberculosis disease is a leading cause of infectious disease morbidity and mortality worldwide, yet many questions related to its diagnosis remain.

- **Methods**: A task force supported by the American Thoracic Society, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Infectious Diseases Society of America searched, selected, and synthesized relevant evidence. The evidence was then used as the basis for recommendations about the diagnosis of tuberculosis disease and LTBI in adults and children. The recommendations were formulated, written, and graded using the Grading, Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.

- **Results**: Twenty-three evidence-based recommendations about diagnostic testing for latent tuberculosis infection, pulmonary tuberculosis, and extrapulmonary tuberculosis are provided. Six of the recommendations are strong, whereas the remaining 17 are conditional.

- **Conclusions**: These guidelines are not intended to impose a standard of care. They provide the basis for rational decisions in the diagnosis of tuberculosis in the context of the existing evidence. No guidelines can take into account all of the often compelling unique individual clinical circumstances.

### Advances in the diagnosis and treatment of latent tuberculosis infection [^116v4Ey4]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2020). Low credibility.

This review describes the major developments in the rationale for treating latent tuberculosis infection, new approaches to identifying persons with latent infection who are most likely to progress to active disease, and the development of novel short-course regimens for treatment of latent tuberculosis.

As many as one-third of the world's population has latent infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Models demonstrate that tuberculosis will not be eliminated without large-scale treatment of persons with latent TB. Tools for identifying persons at risk for active tuberculosis disease include TST and IGRA, which have poor positive predictive values. Newer approaches using gene expression profiling show promise and are being studied in ongoing trials. The development of short-course regimens is a major advance in the treatment of latent TB. Three months of rifapentine with isoniazid, four months of rifampin, and one month of rifapentine with isoniazid have been found to be noninferior to the standard nine months of isoniazid.

Progress towards TB elimination can be accelerated by instituting public health measures that take into account new developments in identifying and treating persons with latent tuberculosis infection who are most likely to progress to active disease.

### Cough due to TB and other chronic infections: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^115pTAzg]. Chest (2018). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for pulmonary tuberculosis, specifically concerning indications for testing, ACCP 2018 guidelines recommend considering Xpert MTB/RIF testing instead of sputum microscopy in patients with a cough and suspected pulmonary tuberculosis, particularly those at high risk of drug-resistant tuberculosis. This includes individuals with a prior history of treatment for pulmonary tuberculosis, contacts of drug-resistant tuberculosis cases, and/or those living in countries with a high prevalence of drug-resistant tuberculosis. When feasible and where resources allow, obtain sputum mycobacterial cultures, drug susceptibility testing, and a chest X-ray (CXR).

Regarding screening and diagnosis for pulmonary tuberculosis, more specifically with respect to screening for latent tuberculosis, ATS/CDC/IDSA 2017 guidelines recommend considering obtaining a tuberculin skin test rather than an IGRA in children under 5 years of age. This is applicable for healthy pediatric individuals if it has been decided that diagnostic testing for latent tuberculosis infection is warranted.

### Guidance for studies evaluating the accuracy of biomarker-based nonsputum tests to diagnose tuberculosis [^1144vwEY]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2019). Low credibility.

The World Health Organization's (WHO) "End TB" strategy calls for the development and implementation of novel tuberculosis (TB) diagnostics. Sputum-based diagnostics are challenging to implement and often less sensitive in high-priority populations. Nonsputum, biomarker-based tests may facilitate TB testing at lower levels of the healthcare system, accelerate treatment initiation, and improve outcomes. We provide guidance on the design of diagnostic accuracy studies evaluating nonsputum, biomarker-based tests within the context of WHO's target product profile for such tests.

Study designs should account for the intended use when choosing the study population, setting, and reference standards. Although adults with respiratory symptoms may be an initial target population, other high-priority populations regardless of symptoms — including people living with human immunodeficiency virus, those unable to produce sputum samples or with extrapulmonary TB, household contacts, and children — should be considered. Studies beyond diagnostic accuracy that evaluate feasibility and population-level impacts are also needed. A biomarker-based diagnostic may be critical to ending the TB epidemic, but requires appropriate validation before implementation.

### Clinical utility of existing and second-generation interferon-γ release assays for diagnostic evaluation of tuberculosis: an observational cohort study [^111Ex5Ty]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2019). Low credibility.

The clinical utility of interferon-γ release assays (IGRAs) for the diagnosis of active tuberculosis is unclear, although they are commonly used in countries with a low incidence of tuberculosis. We aimed to resolve this clinical uncertainty by determining the accuracy and utility of commercially available and second-generation IGRAs in the diagnostic assessment of suspected tuberculosis in a low-incidence setting.

- **Methods**: We conducted a prospective cohort study of adults with suspected tuberculosis in routine secondary care in England. Patients were tested for Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection at baseline with commercially available (T-SPOT.TB and QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube [QFT-GIT]) and second-generation (incorporating novel M. tuberculosis antigens) IGRAs and followed up for 6–12 months to establish definitive diagnoses. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative likelihood ratios, and predictive values of the tests were determined.

- **Findings**: Of the 1060 adults enrolled in the study, 845 were included in the analyses, and 363 were diagnosed with tuberculosis. Sensitivity of T-SPOT.TB for all tuberculosis diagnosis, including culture-confirmed and highly probable cases, was 81.4% (95% CI 76.6–85.3), which was higher than QFT-GIT (67.3% [62.0–72.1]). Second-generation IGRAs had a sensitivity of 94.0% (90.0–96.4) for culture-confirmed tuberculosis and 89.2% (85.2–92.2) when including highly probable tuberculosis, giving a negative likelihood ratio for all tuberculosis cases of 0.13 (95% CI 0.10–0.19). Specificity ranged from 86.2% (95% CI 82.3–89.4) for T-SPOT.

### An update on the diagnosis of tuberculosis infection [^113rdoJp]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Targeted testing and treatment of individuals with latent tuberculosis infection at increased risk of progression to active disease is a key element of tuberculosis control. This strategy is limited by the poor specificity of the tuberculin skin test in populations vaccinated with bacille Calmette-Guérin and its low sensitivity in immunosuppressed persons, who are at the highest risk of progression. Two blood tests, T-SPOT.TB and QuantiFERON-TB Gold, based on detection of IFN-gamma released by T cells in response to M. tuberculosis-specific antigens, may offer an improvement on the skin test. However, validation is challenging due to the lack of a diagnostic gold standard. This critical appraisal of published evidence summarizes the diagnostic accuracy of the new tests.

The blood tests have operational advantages over the skin test because no return visit is required, results are available by the next day, and repeated testing does not cause boosting. Both tests are significantly more specific than the skin test in populations vaccinated with bacille Calmette-Guérin. The data suggest that T-SPOT.TB may be more sensitive than the skin test. Data in groups at high risk of progression to disease are scarce, and more research is needed in these populations. However, it is clear that T-SPOT.TB performs better than the skin test in young children and HIV-infected people with active tuberculosis. Incorporation of these tests into programs for targeted testing of latent tuberculosis infection will reduce false-positive and false-negative results inherent in tuberculin testing.

- **Rifampin**: Daily for 4 months.

- **Isoniazid plus rifampin**: Daily for 3 months in patients with or without human immunodeficiency virus infection.

### How should I interpret an interferon gamma release assay result for tuberculosis infection [^114rYSDH]. Thorax (2013). Low credibility.

Interferon gamma release assays (IGRAs) are the first new diagnostic tests for latent tuberculosis (TB) infection (LTBI) since the century-old tuberculin skin test (TST). They are cell-mediated, immune-based blood tests that have revolutionized LTBI diagnosis and are increasingly recommended by national guidelines.

- **Objectives**: With the rapid expansion of the IGRA evidence base in recent years, the limitations of IGRAs and uncertainties in clinical interpretation of IGRA results have increasingly come into focus. In LTBI diagnosis, these include: prognostic power of IGRAs relative to TST for quantifying risk of progression to active disease, false-negative rates in immunocompromised patients, the clinical meaning of IGRA reversion, and the significance of the size of IGRA response. Furthermore, the role of IGRAs in the diagnostic work-up of active TB is unclear, and there is little evidence supporting the use of the tests in anti-TB treatment monitoring.

- **Methodological approach**: Ongoing large prospective longitudinal clinical endpoint cohort studies of active and latent TB will tackle some of the uncertainties regarding IGRAs. Here, we discuss clinical practice and guidance in light of the uncertainties, based on existing evidence.

- **Conclusions and impact**: Planned clinical research will fill the gaps in the evidence base, narrowing the areas of uncertainty and informing future policy. Translational research into next-generation IGRAs and new T cell-based diagnostic platforms will likely overcome the limitations of IGRAs in the near future.

### Symptom- and chest-radiography screening for active pulmonary tuberculosis in HIV-negative adults and adults with unknown HIV status [^111ApEth]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Low credibility.

- **Results**: The electronic database search identified 9,473 titles and abstracts (Figure 2). Through expert consultation, we identified 31 reports on national tuberculosis prevalence surveys as eligible for inclusion, of which eight were already captured in the search of the electronic databases. Additionally, we identified 957 potentially relevant articles through reference checking. After removal of duplicates, we assessed 10,415 titles and abstracts, ultimately identifying 430 (4%) for full-text review. In the full-text assessment, 364 articles were excluded.

- **Exclusion reasons**: The most common reason for exclusion was that the study design did not allow for evaluation of the sensitivity and specificity of a screening test. This issue was often due to the use of a single screening method (often symptoms) where only screen positives were further evaluated by a reference standard. Additionally, in 175 (48%) publications, the data required to construct a diagnostic two-by-two table were not or insufficiently reported.

- **Included publications**: In total, 66 publications and reports provided data on 59 studies. Two publications included data on multiple studies by either exploring different geographic areas or different populations (Claassens 2017a; Morishita 2017a).

### Revisiting the timetable of tuberculosis [^111RYBns]. BMJ (2018). Low credibility.

Appreciating the natural history of infection and disease should help us to strategize for the global eradication of TB and to design vaccine efficacy trials. Furthermore, the natural history of TB does not support the many terms currently used to describe the various phases of TB infection; these terms are not only confusing but even misleading. We suggest using just three simple terms: tuberculous reactivity, primary infection, and active TB.

- **Suggested simplified terms**:
	- **Tuberculous reactivity**: Indirect evidence of present or past infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis as inferred by a detectable adaptive immune response to M tuberculosis antigens (on tuberculin skin test or interferon gamma release assay) in an asymptomatic person.
	- **Primary infection**: Evidence of new tuberculous infection, obtained with a tuberculin skin test conversion or a new positive interferon gamma release assay, which may be asymptomatic or accompanied by transient fever, erythema nodosum, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate or characteristic roentgenographic abnormalities.
	- **Active tuberculosis**: Evidence of progressive disease of the lung and/or other organs generally accompanied by a positive culture for M tuberculosis and/or roentgenographic findings and/or histopathology consistent with TB.

### Screening for latent tuberculosis infection in adults: US Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^117PdHD8]. JAMA (2016). High credibility.

Tuberculosis remains an important preventable disease in the United States. An effective strategy for reducing the transmission, morbidity, and mortality of active disease is the identification and treatment of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) to prevent progression to active disease.

- **Objective**: To issue a US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation on screening for LTBI.

- **Evidence review**: The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on screening for LTBI in asymptomatic adults seen in primary care, including evidence dating from the inception of searched databases.

- **Findings**: The USPSTF found adequate evidence that accurate screening tests for LTBI are available, treatment of LTBI provides a moderate health benefit in preventing progression to active disease, and the harms of screening and treatment are small. The USPSTF has moderate certainty that screening for LTBI in persons at increased risk for infection provides a moderate net benefit.

- **Conclusions and recommendation**: The USPSTF recommends screening for LTBI in populations at increased risk (B recommendation).

### Meta-analysis: New tests for the diagnosis of latent tuberculosis infection: areas of uncertainty and recommendations for research [^116mwske]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Until recently, the tuberculin skin test was the only method for detecting latent tuberculosis (TB) infection, but two ex vivo interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs) are now commercially licensed.

- **Purpose**: To estimate sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility of IGRAs (commercial or research versions of QuantiFERON [QFT] and Elispot) for diagnosing latent TB infection in healthy and immune-suppressed persons.

- **Data sources**: The authors searched MEDLINE and reviewed citations of all original articles and reviews for studies published in English.

- **Study selection**: Studies had evaluated IGRAs using Mycobacterium tuberculosis-specific antigens (RD1 antigens) and overnight (16- to 24-hour) incubation times. Reference standards had to be clearly defined without knowledge of test results.

- **Data extraction and quality assessment**: Specific criteria for quality assessment were developed for sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility.

- **Data synthesis**: When newly diagnosed active TB was used as a surrogate for latent TB infection, the sensitivity of all tests was suboptimal, although it was higher with Elispot. No test distinguishes active TB from latent TB. Sensitivity of the tuberculin skin test and IGRAs was similar in persons who were categorized into clinical gradients of exposure. Pooled specificity was 97.7% (95% CI, 96% to 99%) and 92.5% (CI, 86% to 99%) for QFT and for Elispot, respectively. Both assays were more specific than the tuberculin skin test in samples vaccinated with bacille Calmette-Guérin. Elispot was more sensitive than the tuberculin skin test in three studies.

### WHO consolidated guidelines on tuberculosis: Module 3: diagnosis – rapid diagnostics for tuberculosis detection [Internet] [^1133fvYB]. Geneva: World Health Organization (2021). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for pulmonary tuberculosis, specifically concerning nucleic acid amplification testing, the WHO 2021 guidelines recommend considering repeated testing with Xpert MTB/RIF. This involves obtaining two tests in sputum, gastric fluid, nasopharyngeal aspirate, or stool specimens for pediatric patients exhibiting signs and symptoms of pulmonary tuberculosis in settings with a pretest probability of ≥ 5% and an Xpert MTB/RIF negative result on the initial test.

### Symptom- and chest-radiography screening for active pulmonary tuberculosis in HIV-negative adults and adults with unknown HIV status [^113kZ1tH]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). High credibility.

This review addresses tuberculosis screening among HIV‐negative people and people with unknown HIV status, a proportion of whom may be HIV‐infected. The risk of developing tuberculosis disease among the 38 million people living with HIV was 18 times higher (range 15 to 21) than in the rest of the global population. In resource‐limited settings, tuberculosis disease is a common and often undiagnosed cause of death. The sensitivity of sputum smear microscopy and Xpert MTB/RIF is lower in HIV‐infected individuals with presumed tuberculosis. Therefore, people living with HIV should be regularly and systematically screened for tuberculosis disease according to a clinical algorithm at each visit to a healthcare facility. In addition, people living with HIV who are unlikely to have active tuberculosis should be offered preventive treatment, regardless of their antiretroviral therapy (ART) status. Screening algorithms for people living with HIV have been defined based on other systematic reviews.

- **Screening algorithms**: The recommended algorithm to rule out tuberculosis disease used to be the Four Symptom Screen, meaning the absence of any of the four symptoms: cough, fever, weight loss, or night sweats, and if available, the absence of abnormal radiographic findings. The latest WHO guidelines recommend the Four Symptom Screen, C-reactive protein, chest X-ray, and molecular WHO-recommended rapid diagnostic tests, depending on the kind of sub-population and availability of resources.

### Screening for latent tuberculosis infection in adults: US Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^1128VtaR]. JAMA (2023). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for extrapulmonary tuberculosis, more specifically with respect to screening for latent tuberculosis, USPSTF 2023 guidelines recommend obtaining screening for latent tuberculosis infection in populations at increased risk.

### Classification of early tuberculosis states to guide research for improved care and prevention: an international Delphi consensus exercise [^115t2f6N]. The Lancet Respiratory Medicine (2024). High credibility.

The active-latent paradigm of tuberculosis largely neglects the documented spectrum of disease. Inconsistency regarding definitions, terminology, and diagnostic criteria for different tuberculosis states has limited the progress in research and product development needed to achieve tuberculosis elimination. We aimed to develop a new framework of classification for tuberculosis that accommodates key disease states but is sufficiently simple to support pragmatic research and implementation. Through an international Delphi exercise involving 71 participants representing a wide range of disciplines, sectors, income settings, and geographies, consensus was reached on a set of conceptual states, related terminology, and research gaps.

The International Consensus for Early TB (ICE-TB) framework distinguishes disease from infection by the presence of macroscopic pathology and defines two subclinical and two clinical tuberculosis states based on reported symptoms or signs of tuberculosis, further differentiated by likely infectiousness. The presence of viable Mycobacterium tuberculosis and an associated host response are prerequisites for all states of infection and disease. Our framework provides a clear direction for tuberculosis research, which will, in time, improve tuberculosis clinical care and elimination policies.

### Screening for latent tuberculosis infection in adults: US Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^113imv8J]. JAMA (2023). High credibility.

In the US, tuberculosis remains an important preventable disease, including active tuberculosis, which may be infectious, and latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI), which is asymptomatic and not infectious but can later progress to active disease. The precise prevalence rate of LTBI in the US is difficult to determine; however, the estimated prevalence is about 5.0%, or up to 13 million persons. Incidence of tuberculosis varies by geography and living accommodations, suggesting an association with social determinants of health.

The objective of this update is to revise the 2016 recommendation. The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) commissioned a systematic review on LTBI screening and treatment in asymptomatic adults seen in primary care, as well as the accuracy of LTBI screening tests.

- **Population**: Asymptomatic adults 18 years or older at increased risk for tuberculosis.

- **Evidence assessment**: The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that there is a moderate net benefit in preventing active tuberculosis disease by screening for LTBI in persons at increased risk for tuberculosis infection.

- **Recommendation**: The USPSTF recommends screening for LTBI in populations at increased risk (B recommendation).

### Sensitivity, specificity, and safety of a novel ESAT6-CFP10 skin test for tuberculosis infection in China: 2 randomized, self-controlled, parallel-group phase 2b trials [^1121zvZF]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Low credibility.

The diagnostics available to identify tuberculosis infection are limited. This study assessed the diagnostic accuracy and safety of the ESAT6-CFP10 (EC) skin test for tuberculosis infection in Chinese adults.

We conducted two randomized, parallel-group clinical trials involving healthy participants and tuberculosis patients. Each participant underwent the T-SPOT.TB test, followed by an EC skin test and a tuberculin skin test (TST). Skin indurations and redness at injection sites were measured over time. A bacillus Calmette Guerin (BCG) model was used to evaluate the diagnosis of tuberculosis infection through the EC skin test.

A total of 777 healthy participants and 96 tuberculosis patients were grouped to receive the EC skin test at concentrations of 1.0 μg/0.1 mL or 0.5 μg/0.1 mL. The area under the curve reached 0.95 (95% confidence interval, 0.91–0.97) for the EC skin test at 1.0 μg/0.1 mL within 24–72 hours. When compared with the T-SPOT.TB test, the EC skin test demonstrated similar sensitivity (87.5%, 95% CI, 77.8–97.2 vs. 86.5%, 95% CI, 79.5–93.4) and specificity (98.9%, 95% CI, 96.0–99.9 vs. 96.1%, 95% CI, 93.5–97.8). Among BCG-vaccinated participants, the EC skin test showed high consistency with the T-SPOT.TB test (96.3%, 95% CI, 92.0–100.0). No serious adverse events related to the EC skin test were observed.

In conclusion, the EC skin test demonstrated high specificity and sensitivity at a dose of 1.0 μg/0.1 mL, comparable to the T-SPOT.TB test. The diagnostic accuracy of the EC skin test was unaffected by BCG vaccination.

### Symptom- and chest-radiography screening for active pulmonary tuberculosis in HIV-negative adults and adults with unknown HIV status [^115tnj3n]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Low credibility.

Despite the strengths of the review, the certainty of evidence remained very low for the summary sensitivity estimates of all index tests, except for CXR abnormalities suggestive of tuberculosis, for which the certainty of evidence was low. Serious inconsistency, as discussed above, contributed to a very low certainty of evidence, as the range in point estimates was wide to very wide. Furthermore, the very serious risk of bias in the Reference Standard domain reduced the certainty of evidence, as more than half of the studies did not require all participants to undergo microbacteriological testing but classified participants as tuberculosis-negative based on results of CXR and symptoms, indicating incorporation bias.

In the Flow and Timing domain, the risk of bias was considered high for over half of the studies, mostly due to the extent of missing test results for participants who required microbacteriological testing based on the protocol. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the direction of this bias, as restricting analyses to studies with low risk of bias in these QUADAS-2 domains resulted in considerably lower summary sensitivity estimates.

The high sensitivity of the parallel combination of CXR and symptom questions should be interpreted with even greater caution, as in most of these studies sensitivity was close to 100%. The sensitivity was 100% by definition because participants without CXR abnormalities and without symptoms were defined by this parallel combination as 'not having tuberculosis' and were ineligible for further testing.

### Diagnosis of latent tuberculosis infection: The potential role of new technologies [^117NLC2x]. Respiratory Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Tuberculosis (TB) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. TB control programs require enhancement in the diagnosis of latent TB infection. The tuberculin skin test (TST) is not considered a 'gold' standard as it often yields false results. Interferon-gamma assays, which are newly available tests for detecting latent TB infection, are currently not routinely employed. These assays are based on immune responses to purified protein derivative (PPD) or region of difference 1 (RD1) specific antigens. Assays based on RD1-specific antigens outperform both PPD-based assays and TST. They correlate with TB exposure and are less likely to produce false results in cases of non-tuberculous mycobacterial disease, Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination, and immunosuppression.

A more accurate diagnosis of latent TB infection using RD1-specific antigen-based interferon-gamma assays may allow for targeted chemoprophylaxis, reducing the burden of active TB while minimizing the wastage of healthcare resources due to false results associated with TST. However, further research and development are needed to verify that these new tests can predict the risk of later development of active TB and to ensure feasibility for performing these tests reproducibly and affordably, particularly in developing countries.

### Beyond latent and active tuberculosis: a scoping review of conceptual frameworks [^112mARyu]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Low credibility.

Developing diagnostics that can differentiate between states will be essential for a novel framework to be meaningful clinically. In particular, tests that can discriminate between States 0, I, II, and III, identified in our review — clearance of infection, presence of viable bacilli, containment of infection, and breakdown of immune control — have critical clinical and public health significance. Similarly, approaches toward treatment that are based on a binary paradigm will need to be adapted, potentially including novel regimens or varying durations of existing regimens.

Outcomes of vaccinology studies may require reconsideration with a clearer understanding of which states are being targeted and prevented through the administration of a vaccine. While the First International Symposium on New Concepts in Early TB Disease aimed to develop consensus around a novel framework with consistent definitions and terminologies, it is important that this framework is regularly updated with advancements in our understanding of the disease process. This can potentially include states for post-TB lung disease that were not a part of this review.

### Classification of early tuberculosis states to guide research for improved care and prevention: An international Delphi consensus exercise [^1171jz2u]. The Lancet Respiratory Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Tuberculosis (TB) has been a major cause of morbidity and mortality for thousands of years. Despite the availability of a vaccine for over 100 years and drugs for over 75 years, TB remains the leading cause of death globally from an infectious disease. TB has a complex natural history and pathogenesis, which is still incompletely understood. Only a minority of people exposed and considered infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) progress to disease. The incubation period is variable, with highly heterogeneous disease presentation and progression pathways. Faced with this complexity, a simplifying framework has value in helping to guide and communicate the public health approach, management, and scientific investigation of TB. Periodically, the nature of the framework must inevitably evolve, reflecting new scientific understanding, tools for diagnosis and intervention, and public health priorities.

The development of curative antibiotic treatment from the late 1940s resulted in a radical change in the approach to managing TB and led to a shift in approach to disease classification. Prior to this period, TB was recognized as a dynamic process, with prognostic stratification by disease extent on chest X-ray (CXR) and the precise classification of disease states (arrested, quiescent, active, etc). This approach was abandoned, and in its place, a simple binary paradigm of latent infection and active disease emerged. The diagnosis of disease increasingly focused on microbiological confirmation as a prerequisite for receiving curative treatment.

### Update on latent tuberculosis infection [^111bmnAW]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Latent tuberculosis infection refers to an asymptomatic, nontransmissible infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, carrying a 5% to 10% lifetime risk of progressing to active disease. One-half of this risk occurs within the first two years after infection. High-risk groups include recent immigrants from high-incidence countries, health care professionals, persons living or working in institutional settings, and homeless persons. Risk factors for progression to active disease include immunodeficiency, recent exposure to tuberculosis, and chronic kidney disease requiring dialysis. Tuberculin skin testing has several limitations, including the need for multiple office visits and the potential for false-positive results in patients who have received the bacillus Calmette-Guérin vaccine or been exposed to environmental mycobacteria.

Interferon-gamma release assays address these deficiencies but are limited by their cost and requirement for blood processing. Interferon-gamma release assays are preferred in immigrants exposed to bacillus Calmette-Guérin and in patients who are not likely to return for interpretation of skin test results. Tuberculin skin testing is preferred for children younger than five years. Active disease should be excluded before initiating treatment. The newest treatment option of 12 weekly doses of isoniazid and rifapentine has similar or better effectiveness than standard nine-month therapy with daily isoniazid. A four-month regimen of daily rifampin is another alternative.

- **Past tuberculosis treatment**: Patients who have been treated for tuberculosis in the past.
- **Foreign residency**: Individuals born in or who have lived for at least one year in a foreign country with at least a moderate tuberculosis incidence (≥ 20 per 100,000) or a high primary MDR-TB prevalence (≥ 2%).

### Should interferon gamma release assays become the standard method for screening patients for Mycobacterium tuberculosis infections in the United States [^117N2244]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2011). Low credibility.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently published updated guidelines for the use of interferon gamma release assays (IGRAs) to detect Mycobacterium tuberculosis. This document provides a balanced analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of IGRAs. At the time of writing, these assays have not been widely adopted in the United States by clinical laboratories. We have asked two experts, Thomas Alexander of Summa Health Care, who has adopted an IGRA for M. tuberculosis detection in his laboratory, and Melissa Miller of UNC Hospitals, who has evaluated one but has not chosen to adopt it, to explain how each reached this decision based on their experience with the test and the data that have been published concerning IGRA.

### New diagnostics to infer risk in tuberculosis: Is the term "latent tuberculosis infection" obsolete [^114mnVks]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Accurate diagnosis and estimation of risk in latent tuberculous infection (LTBI) remain major clinical and global health challenges. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection reflects a continuum between LTBI and active tuberculosis (TB). LTBI is the most common form of Mtb infection, affecting one-quarter of the world's population and resulting in approximately 2,000,000 deaths every year. Immunocompetent individuals with LTBI have a 5–10% risk of developing active TB during their lifetime, most commonly within the first two years after exposure. While treatment of LTBI is effective in reducing the risk of developing subsequent active TB disease, identifying patients most at risk of developing active TB and ensuring successful LTBI treatment remain significant challenges.

Available laboratory tests for the detection of LTBI have serious diagnostic limitations, including a poor predictive value (< 5%) for identifying subjects with LTBI who will actually develop active TB. Tuberculin skin testing and IFN-γ release assays can detect cell-mediated immune reactivity in Mtb infection. However, none of these tests can differentiate LTBI from active TB, nor can they distinguish between those who achieve subsequent bacterial clearance and/or effective infection containment from others who have silent and persistent infection at high risk to develop TB. Therefore, improvements in TB diagnostics are urgently needed not only to improve both sensitivity and specificity of Mtb infection detection but also to more accurately determine the risk of progression or reactivation into active TB.

### Classification of early tuberculosis states to guide research for improved care and prevention: An international Delphi consensus exercise [^115hxnP3]. The Lancet Respiratory Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

While identifying diagnostic criteria for the states was a desired outcome of the ICE-TB meeting, the lack of validated tools for some states meant this was not feasible. However, acknowledging the limitations, it was agreed that tools across the expanding diagnostic landscape could be used to classify an individual's TB state according to the relevant disease dimensions, particularly in a research context. Establishment of appropriate reference standards for the new states and subsequent development of new diagnostic tools will be necessary to define the TB states more accurately.

- **Diagnostic considerations**: The issue of imperfect reference standards has long been a challenge for the TB field, especially for extrapulmonary TB, pediatric TB, and TB in people living with HIV, due to the paucibacillary nature of the samples usually available for diagnosis. However, many research groups have designed and validated composite reference standards with predetermined rules, consisting of multiple concurrent or sequential tests and applying statistical methods to correct for the imperfect nature of the existing reference standards, such as for TB meningitis. Additionally, applying Bayesian approaches, such as latent class analysis where imperfect reference standards exist, can help minimize misclassification when conducting accuracy trials. Following the development of a consensus-driven reference standard, it will be imperative to have robust study designs to evaluate.

### Global health 2050: The path to halving premature death by mid-century [^112j9aaN]. The Lancet (2024). High credibility.

Diagnosis is, according to Pai and colleagues, "the weakest aspect of TB care and control"; without diagnosis, the disease cannot be treated. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, around 2.9 million people annually had tuberculosis without being diagnosed, and the annual diagnostic gap grew to 4.2 million during the pandemic. Using new diagnostics along the case finding "cascade" — for those with subclinical tuberculosis, those with symptoms who have not sought care, and those who have sought care but are undiagnosed — could reap large benefits.

New molecular diagnostics are now available that can be used at the point of care (POC) in decentralized settings, and the WHO recommends molecular diagnosis over sputum smear microscopy as the preferred frontline testing option. Given the limitations of using sputum, especially in children and people with HIV, efforts are now underway to develop molecular diagnostics based on tongue swabs, urine, blood, and stool, and to develop multi-disease tests.

- **Benefits of non-sputum samples**: "A simple, non-sputum sample", say Pai et al, "combined with an affordable, multi-disease POC molecular technology, deployed in decentralized settings would reach a much larger population, close the case detection gap, and curb TB transmission at the population level".

Screening for tuberculosis and latent tuberculosis has been made more feasible with the advent of interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs), which have many advantages over tuberculin skin tests, and the C-TB skin test. The C-TB test is now being mass produced by the Serum Institute of India and has a sensitivity and specificity close to that of the IGRA.

### Defining the role of cellular immune signatures in diagnostic evaluation of suspected tuberculosis [^116VVA7a]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2022). Low credibility.

In high-income, low-incidence regions, including Europe and North America, the proportion of active tuberculosis (TB) cases that are paucibacillary and/or extra-pulmonary tuberculosis (EPTB) is large and rising. These clinical presentations usually necessitate invasive sampling, typically bronchoalveolar lavage for paucibacillary pulmonary TB and biopsies for EPTB. Moreover, clinical samples are commonly Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) culture-negative and acid-fast bacillus (AFB) smear-negative, which makes diagnosis clinically challenging, prolongs the duration of hospital admission, and delays treatment initiation. Hence, there is an important unmet clinical need for a rapid, noninvasive blood test with sufficient specificity to rule in paucibacillary and EPTB.

A rational approach to detect TB infection in paucibacillary cases is to use tests measuring the Mtb-specific adaptive immune response, which provides an amplified signal of a low bacillary burden infection. Measuring such responses is possible from blood samples, obviating the need for invasive sampling. Available immune tests for TB include the interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs), which are commonly used in the diagnostic work-up of active TB; indeed, the sensitivity of currently available and next-generation IGRAs far exceeds that of culture. However, IGRAs lack specificity for diagnosing active TB because they also score positive in patients with non-TB illness who have incidental, concomitant latent TB infection (LTBI).

### Classification of early tuberculosis states to guide research for improved care and prevention: An international Delphi consensus exercise [^117AHSRh]. The Lancet Respiratory Medicine (2024). High credibility.

The active/latent paradigm of tuberculosis (TB) largely neglects the documented spectrum of disease. The lack of consistency in definitions, terminology, and diagnostic criteria for different TB states constrains progress in research and product development required to achieve TB elimination.

We reached consensus on a set of conceptual states, related terminology, and research gaps through a Delphi process involving 64 experts, representing a wide range of disciplines, sectors, income settings, and geographies.

The resulting International Consensus for Early TB (ICE-TB) framework distinguishes disease from infection by the presence of macroscopic pathology. It defines two subclinical and two clinical tuberculosis states based on reported symptoms or signs of TB, further differentiated by likely infectiousness. The presence of viable M. tuberculosis and an associated host response are prerequisites for all infection and disease states.

Our framework provides a clear direction for TB research, which, in time with scientific progress, will improve TB clinical care and elimination policies.

### Symptom- and chest-radiography screening for active pulmonary tuberculosis in HIV-negative adults and adults with unknown HIV status [^111XhvVT]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). High credibility.

Systematic screening in high-burden settings is recommended as a strategy for early detection of pulmonary tuberculosis disease. This approach aims to reduce mortality, morbidity, and transmission, while also improving equity in access to care. Historically, questioning for symptoms and chest radiography (CXR) have been the most widely available tools for tuberculosis disease screening. The accuracy of these tools is crucial, as it influences the design of tuberculosis screening programs and, combined with the accuracy of confirmatory diagnostic tests, determines the yield of a screening program and the burden on individuals and health services.

- **Objectives**: To assess the sensitivity and specificity of questioning for the presence of one or more tuberculosis symptoms or symptom combinations, CXR, and combinations of these as screening tools for detecting bacteriologically confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis disease in HIV-negative adults and adults with unknown HIV status who are eligible for systematic screening for tuberculosis disease. Additionally, to investigate sources of heterogeneity, particularly concerning regional, epidemiological, and demographic characteristics of the study populations.

- **Search methods**: The MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, and HTA (Health Technology Assessment) databases were searched using pre-specified terms, and experts were consulted for unpublished reports, covering the period from 1992 to 2018. The search was conducted on 10 December 2018, and repeated on 2 July 2021.

### What if they don't have tuberculosis? The consequences and trade-offs involved in false-positive diagnoses of tuberculosis [^112ziBqJ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Low credibility.

To find the millions of missed tuberculosis (TB) cases, national TB programs are under pressure to expand TB disease screening and target populations with lower disease prevalence. Together with imperfect performance and application of existing diagnostic tools, including empirical diagnosis, broader screening risks placing individuals without TB on prolonged treatment. These false-positive diagnoses have profound consequences for TB patients and prevention efforts, yet are usually overlooked in policy decision-making.

In this article, we describe the pathways to a false-positive TB diagnosis, including trade-offs involved in the development and application of diagnostic algorithms. We then consider the wide range of potential consequences for individuals, households, health systems, and the reliability of surveillance data. Finally, we suggest practical steps that the TB community can take to reduce the frequency and potential harms of false-positive TB diagnosis and to more explicitly assess the trade-offs involved in the screening and diagnostic process.

### Improved diagnostic evaluation of suspected tuberculosis [^112pKu1i]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

The role of new T-cell-based blood tests for tuberculosis in the diagnosis of active tuberculosis is unclear.

- **Objective**: To compare the performance of two interferon-gamma assays and tuberculin skin testing in adults with suspected tuberculosis.

- **Design**: Prospective study conducted in routine practice.

- **Setting**: Two urban hospitals in the United Kingdom.

- **Patients**: 389 adults, predominantly of South Asian and Black ethnicity, with moderate to high clinical suspicion of active tuberculosis.

- **Intervention**: Tuberculin skin testing, the enzyme-linked immunospot assay (ELISpot) incorporating early secretory antigenic target-6 and culture filtrate protein-10 (standard ELISpot), and ELISpot incorporating a novel antigen, Rv3879c (ELISpot(PLUS)), were performed during diagnostic assessment by independent persons who were blinded to results of the other tests.

- **Measurements**: Sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, and likelihood ratios.

194 patients had a final diagnosis of active tuberculosis, of which 79% were culture-confirmed. Sensitivity for culture confirmed and highly probable tuberculosis was 89% (95% CI, 84% to 93%) with ELISpot(PLUS), 85% (CI, 79% to 90%) with standard ELISpot, 79% (CI, 72% to 85%) with 15-mm threshold tuberculin skin testing, and 83% (CI, 77% to 89%) with stratified thresholds of 15 and 10 mm in vaccinated and unvaccinated patients, respectively. The ELISpot(PLUS) assay was more sensitive than tuberculin skin testing at 15-mm cutoff points (P = 0.01) but not with stratified cutoff points (P = 0.10).

### Optimization and interpretation of serial QuantiFERON testing to measure acquisition of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection [^117SPT35]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Conversion from a negative to a positive QuantiFERON-TB test is indicative of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection, which predisposes individuals to tuberculosis disease. Interpretation of serial tests is confounded by immunological and technical variability.

- **Objectives**: To improve the consistency of serial QuantiFERON-TB testing algorithms and provide a data-driven definition of conversion.

- **Methods**: Sources of QuantiFERON-TB variability were assessed, and optimal procedures were identified. Distributions of IFN-γ response levels were analyzed in healthy adolescents, Mtb-unexposed control subjects, and patients with pulmonary tuberculosis.

- **Measurements and main results**: Individuals with no known Mtb exposure had IFN-γ values less than 0.2 IU/ml. Among individuals with IFN-γ values less than 0.2 IU/ml, 0.2–0.34 IU/ml, 0.35–0.7 IU/ml, and greater than 0.7 IU/ml, tuberculin skin test positivity results were 15%, 53%, 66%, and 91% (P < 0.005), respectively. These findings suggest that values less than 0.2 IU/ml were true negatives. In short-term serial testing, "uncertain" conversions with at least one value within the uncertainty zone (0.2–0.7 IU/ml) were partly explained by technical assay variability. Individuals who had a change in QuantiFERON-TB IFN-γ values from less than 0.2 to greater than 0.7 IU/ml had 10-fold higher tuberculosis incidence rates than those who maintained values less than 0.2 IU/ml over 2 years (P = 0.0003). By contrast, "uncertain" converters were not at higher risk than nonconverters (P = 0.229).

Regarding screening and diagnosis for pulmonary tuberculosis, and more specifically with respect to screening for latent tuberculosis, ATS/CDC/IDSA 2017 guidelines recommend considering obtaining an IGRA rather than a tuberculin skin test in all patients aged 5 years and older who meet the following criteria:

- **Likely to be infected**: Patients likely to be infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
- **Disease progression risk**: Patients with low or intermediate risk of disease progression.
- **Testing decision**: It has been decided that testing for latent tuberculosis infection is warranted.

### Symptom- and chest-radiography screening for active pulmonary tuberculosis in HIV-negative adults and adults with unknown HIV status [^114g8zAE]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). High credibility.

We assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE methodology (Schünemann 2020a; Schünemann 2020b).

After completing the initial review, we considered whether an updated search could potentially enhance the certainty of the evidence and lead to firmer conclusions. We conducted an updated search in MEDLINE and Embase on 2 July 2021, focusing on records containing tuberculosis terms, DTA terms, and terms for our reference standard in the title or abstract. This selection would likely include high-quality studies. We then evaluated the restricted set using the review's eligibility criteria. For studies eligible for inclusion, we assessed risks of bias and applicability concerns within the QUADAS-2 domains.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for pulmonary tuberculosis, more specifically with respect to screening for latent tuberculosis, the ATS/CDC/IDSA 2017 guidelines recommend obtaining an IGRA rather than a tuberculin skin test in patients aged 5 years and older who meet the following criteria:

- **Likely to be infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis**: These individuals are considered at risk due to possible exposure.

- **Low or intermediate risk of disease progression**: Patients in this category are evaluated for the absence of significant risk factors that could lead to active tuberculosis.

- **Testing for latent tuberculosis infection is warranted**: This decision is made based on clinical judgment and potential outcomes.

- **History of BCG vaccination or expected difficulty in returning for TST reading**: This criterion addresses the practicality of testing and reading results accurately in certain patient populations.

### Latent tuberculosis infection-associated immunodiagnostic test responses as biomarkers of incipient tuberculosis: Fruitful or futile [^113AdXFN]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

The study by Gupta and coworkers in this issue of the journal provides answers to some of these questions. Their findings were based on the results of the prospective UK PREDICT (UK Prognostic Evaluation of Diagnostic IGRAs Consortium) study that evaluated three immunodiagnostic tests (T-SPOT.TB, QFT-GIT, and TST) in almost 10,000 participants who were at high risk for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI), such as close contacts of active TB cases or recent migrants, sequentially recruited from 54 centers in the United Kingdom. They found that although the magnitude of the IGRA (both QFT-GIT and T-SPOT.TB) and the TST response was a biomarker of incipient TB, the threshold-specific positive predictive value for all three immunodiagnostic tests for active TB over a median follow-up of approximately three years was poor, at less than 5%. This is because there were many nonprogressors who had a magnitude of response at or above the threshold identifying incipient TB. Moreover, using this higher threshold in clinical practice would result in a substantial drop in test sensitivity to detect active TB cases, making the usefulness of such an approach redundant. This is because IGRAs and TSTs are simply poor tests of incipient TB. This is not surprising, as only a small proportion of those with LTBI (approximately 5%) will progress to active disease.

The authors must be commended on undertaking such a challenging study both in terms of recruitment and analysis. The findings are helpful to clinicians and public health physicians who are using immunodiagnostic tests in screening programs. It suggests that alternative biomarkers of incipient TB are urgently needed.

### WHO consolidated guidelines on tuberculosis: Module 3: Diagnosis – Rapid diagnostics for tuberculosis detection [Internet] [^111XyQsn]. Geneva: World Health Organization (2021). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for pulmonary tuberculosis, particularly focusing on nucleic acid amplification testing: WHO 2021 guidelines recommend obtaining Xpert Ultra rather than relying on smear microscopy, culture, and phenotypic drug susceptibility testing. Xpert Ultra is advised as the initial diagnostic test for detecting tuberculosis and rifampin resistance in sputum from adult patients who exhibit signs and symptoms of pulmonary tuberculosis. This recommendation applies to individuals without a prior history of tuberculosis within the past five years or those with a remote history of tuberculosis treatment (more than five years since the end of treatment).

### Symptom- and chest-radiography screening for active pulmonary tuberculosis in HIV-negative adults and adults with unknown HIV status [^1124C9sp]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). High credibility.

We excluded studies that evaluated symptoms, or CXR, or both in a typical passive case detection setting. This applies to clinical settings where patients report to a health facility due to illness and have symptoms and signs that warrant tuberculosis investigations according to national or global guidelines for passive case detection. We included studies in an outpatient context among people who would not be considered a presumed tuberculosis case by such guidelines, for example, attendants of diabetic clinics or antenatal clinics. Studies evaluating CXR screening in a pre-selected symptomatic population were outside the scope of this review and were excluded; we report CXR index tests in populations defined as eligible for screening regardless of the presence of symptoms. Prevalence surveys, in which the reported bacteriologically positive tuberculosis cases included some people who had already started tuberculosis treatment, were included and described since the proportion of identified cases to whom this applies is usually small.

- **Index tests**: For index tests based on symptom questions, we selected studies that evaluated one or more author-defined symptoms or symptom combinations and categorized those into three commonly used and recognizable definitions:

	- 'Cough for two or more weeks': Presence of a cough lasting for two or more weeks. Prolonged cough is an important component of the definition of presumed tuberculosis in clinical guidelines, recommending that all individuals with this symptom be investigated.

### Beyond latent and active tuberculosis: A scoping review of conceptual frameworks [^1123GmrN]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). High credibility.

There is growing recognition that tuberculosis (TB) infection and disease exist as a spectrum of states beyond the binary classification of latent and active TB. Our aim was to systematically map and synthesize published conceptual frameworks for TB states. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and EMcare for review articles from 1946 to September 2023. We included 40 articles that explicitly described more than two states for TB.

We identified that terminology, definitions, and diagnostic criteria for additional TB states within these articles were inconsistent.

- **Eight broad conceptual themes**: were identified to categorize TB states:
	- **State 0**: Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) elimination with innate immune response (n = 25/40, 63%)
	- **State I**: Mtb elimination by acquired immune response (n = 31/40, 78%)
	- **State II**: Mtb infection not eliminated but controlled (n = 37/40, 93%)
	- **State III**: Mtb infection not controlled (n = 24/40, 60%)
	- **State IV**: Bacteriologically positive without symptoms (n = 26/40, 65%)
	- **State V**: Signs or symptoms associated with TB (n = 39/40, 98%)
	- **State VI**: Severe or disseminated TB disease (n = 11/40, 28%)
	- **State VII**: Previous history of TB (n = 5/40, 13%)

Consensus on a non-binary framework that includes additional TB states is required to standardize scientific communication and to inform advancements in research, clinical, and public health practice.

### What if they don't have tuberculosis? The consequences and trade-offs involved in false-positive diagnoses of tuberculosis [^113GxSXS]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Low credibility.

Work is needed to provide quantitative estimates for the weight a false-positive diagnosis should carry compared to a false-negative diagnosis, for example, by quantifying the costs and quality-adjusted life years lost through incorrect diagnoses for individuals with versus without tuberculosis (TB). Such work could examine the acceptable number of false-positive TB diagnoses for one additional true-positive diagnosis across different settings. A number of papers have already highlighted strong discrepancies between perceived and data-based thresholds, as well as variation between the preferences of clinicians, public health officials, and patients.

- **Empirical data**: Another key area of research is to improve the empirical data underlying our estimates of test performance, particularly the accuracy of empirical diagnosis and the specificity of "definitive" diagnostic tests. While reviews and examples of research exist, substantial uncertainty remains on the baseline performance of key tests, particularly as implemented in actual field settings. One example is the specificity of sputum smear, which has shown great variability in recent prevalence surveys, with up to 43% of smear-positive cases not confirmed by culture.

- **Setting-specific data**: Some of these data will be setting-specific, particularly for empirical diagnosis. However, a better understanding of how the performance depends on specific factors (e.g. background TB and HIV prevalence, use/availability of radiographs) will help inform estimates. Recent studies have also highlighted the value of considering urine LAM and C-reactive protein as part of TB screening in high-risk populations.

### Viewpoint: Challenges and opportunities in tuberculosis research [^1117Dioh]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Despite these successes, many questions remain in all aspects of tuberculosis research, ranging from fundamental pathogenesis to programmatic implementation. These questions are complicated by the complexity of the disease and its chronic nature. Compared with other infections, *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* infection does not elicit clinically relevant disease in the majority of subjects. Many who are infected carry asymptomatic, paucibacillary disease for decades. This complicates the definition and evaluation of early infection events, initial host responses, and the characterization of infecting bacillary populations.

The clinical definition of latent infection is limited to positive responses to injection of purified mycobacterial components (i.e. the tuberculosis skin test) or to T-cell–recall responses measured through the production of interferon γ. Unlike viral infections, latent tuberculous infections cannot be identified on the basis of stable antibody titers. Progression to active disease is not a clear unidirectional process and is prolonged. Many affected persons appear to be able to clear the infection, whereas others progress to active disease. The spectrum of active tuberculosis is complex. Although adult pulmonary tuberculosis is considered of greatest relevance for public health, extrapulmonary disease occurs in a significant portion of subjects. Pediatric manifestations of tuberculosis may be mistaken for other pulmonary infections and are difficult to diagnose.

Treatment of active disease is complicated by the fact that the standard of care is constantly evolving and adapting to new challenges.

### Assessing the diagnostic performance of new commercial interferon-γ release assays for Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^113VNGQS]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

To determine whether new or updated IGRAs could be included under WHO recommendations for IGRA testing, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis. The purpose was to compare the diagnostic performance of the new tests (QFT-Plus, QIAreach, QFT-Plus CLIA, TB-IGRA, TB-Feron, and T-SPOT.TB with T-Cell Select) with the WHO-endorsed IGRAs (QFT-G, QFT-GIT, or T-SPOT.TB). Partial results from this review for QFT-Plus, QIAreach, TB-IGRA, TB-Feron, and T-SPOT.TB with T-Cell Select were presented to a WHO technical advisory group in October 2021.

### Guidelines on interferon-γ release assays for tuberculosis infection: concordance, discordance or confusion [^112hKrFk]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2011). Low credibility.

Identification of latent tuberculosis (TB) infection and preventive therapy is crucial for TB control, especially in high-risk populations. Since the advent of interferon-γ release assays (IGRAs), numerous studies have evaluated their role in diagnosing active and latent TB. With the growing evidence base, many guidelines now include IGRAs. We surveyed the literature and consulted experts to identify 33 guidelines and position papers from 25 countries and two supranational organizations.

The results demonstrate considerable diversity in the recommendations on IGRAs, with four common approaches proposed:

- **Two-step approach**: Tuberculin skin test (TST) first, followed by IGRA, either when the TST is negative (to increase sensitivity, mainly in immunocompromised individuals) or when the TST is positive (to increase specificity, mainly in Bacillus Calmette-Guérin-vaccinated individuals).

- **Either TST or IGRA**: But not both.

- **IGRA and TST together**: To increase sensitivity.

- **IGRA only**: Replacing the TST.

Overall, the use of IGRAs is increasingly recommended. However, most guidelines do not employ objective, transparent methods to grade evidence and recommendations and fail to disclose conflicts of interest. Future IGRA guidelines must aim to be transparent, evidence-based, periodically updated, and free of financial conflicts and industry involvement.

### Spevigo [^113upQxH]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Evaluate patients for active or latent tuberculosis (TB) infection. Spevigo initiation is not recommended in patients with active TB infection. Consider initiating treatment of latent TB prior to initiation of Spevigo [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Complete all age-appropriate vaccinations according to immunization guidelines prior to initiating Spevigo for treatment of GPP [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

- **Important administration information**:
	- **Subcutaneous use for treatment of GPP when not experiencing a flare**:
		Spevigo prefilled syringes are for subcutaneous use for treatment of GPP when not experiencing a flare. If required, the 600 mg subcutaneous loading dose of Spevigo is to be administered by a healthcare professional [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. For subsequent 300 mg doses, if the healthcare professional determines that it is appropriate, a patient 12 years of age and older may self-inject or the caregiver may administer Spevigo after proper training in subcutaneous injection technique. In pediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age, administer Spevigo under the supervision of an adult. If a patient experiences a GPP flare while receiving subcutaneous Spevigo, the GPP flare may be treated with intravenous Spevigo [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

	- **Intravenous use for treatment of GPP flare**:
		Spevigo vials are for intravenous use for treatment of GPP flare. Intravenous infusion of Spevigo is only to be administered by a healthcare professional in a healthcare setting.

### Exclusion of active Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex infection with the T-SPOT.TB assay [^115Lpew7]. The European Respiratory Journal (2007). Low credibility.

The present brief report describes four cases with mycobacterial infection and negative T-SPOT.TB tests. This test proved to be a useful tool to help rule out the diagnosis of active Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection and could therefore prevent unnecessary or inappropriate therapy.

### Diagnostic 'omics' for active tuberculosis [^112EvYxm]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Alternatively, it may be more suitable to use -omics-based tests as triage tests to rule out TB when a high sensitivity can be reached but with lower specificity. The suggested minimum requirements for a TB triage test have been set out as > 90% sensitivity and > 70% specificity. Again, these requirements have been met by some of the published studies. However, substantial technical progress is needed to reduce price, equipment requirements, and time for sample analysis to make -omics tests adequate for field use.

While signatures containing multiple biomarkers (proteins, metabolites, or transcripts) are more likely to be successful in identifying active TB, it is still worth exploring strategies that can reduce these to facilitate translation into diagnostic tests. For example, a minimal set of genes with a high diagnostic accuracy could be measured by more conventional techniques (e.g. PCR) in the field, as demonstrated by Maertzdorf et al. It is unlikely, however, that one signature will be adequate to diagnose active TB in all clinical settings. It is more conceivable that different combinations of biomarkers will confer diagnostic value in different settings, for example, one set of markers for differentiating between active and latent TB, and another to diagnose TB in comparison to other diseases.
