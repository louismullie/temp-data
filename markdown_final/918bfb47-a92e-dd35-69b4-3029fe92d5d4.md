## Question

Pediatric toe walking

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about pediatric toe walking. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about definitions and epidemiology to frame pretest probability. Then, I should verify the differential diagnosis and red flags that mandate evaluation. Next, I will review the focused history and physical examination, including when to add gait analysis or imaging. After that, I need to appraise the natural history to guide counseling. Then, I will examine treatment options by age and severity, including the strength of evidence. Finally, I should consider special populations, prognosis, and a practical decision algorithm, while double-checking areas of controversy and correcting any misstatements as I go.

> Let me first confirm the definition and epidemiology so I don't jump to conclusions. Idiopathic toe walking is a gait pattern in which a child walks on the toes without an underlying neurologic, muscular, or developmental disorder, and it is a diagnosis of exclusion after ruling out pathologic causes, with prevalence around 5% at 5.5 years and a spontaneous resolution rate near 79% by age 10 without intervention, which is crucial for counseling families [^441f30ad] [^4d88c0f4].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about "benign" toe walking. I need to check the differential and red flags that warrant further workup. Pathologic causes include cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy, peripheral neuropathy, hereditary spastic paraparesis, autism spectrum disorder, and spinal cord anomalies, and red flags include unilateral toe walking, delayed motor milestones, regression, abnormal reflexes, asymmetry, or persistent toe walking beyond roughly 2–3 years, which should prompt targeted evaluation rather than reassurance alone [^4e5e7ea1] [^036af8ed] [^12250b8e].

> Wait, let me verify the initial assessment elements so I don't miss anything. A careful history should document age of onset, developmental milestones, family history, birth history, and any regression, while the physical exam should include gait observation, symmetry, passive ankle dorsiflexion with the Silfverskiöld test, muscle bulk, tone, reflexes, and a brief neurologic screen. Persistent equinus or inability to achieve heel contact on passive stretch raises concern for contracture and may influence management decisions [^2d1a262d] [^142d3edc] [^997ba915].

> I should confirm when to escalate diagnostics. If the child is older than about 3 years, has limited dorsiflexion, asymmetric gait, or other neurologic signs, consider gait analysis to distinguish ITW from mild spastic diplegia, and consider spinal MRI when there is late-onset toe walking, severe contracture, abnormal reflexes, or failure of conservative care, as major intraspinal pathology is found in about 25% of selected cases and may require neurosurgical intervention [^d27a6634] [^819c95ab].

> Let me think about natural history because this drives counseling. Most children with ITW resolve spontaneously by age 10, and in a population-based cohort, 79% ceased toe walking without treatment and without developing triceps surae contractures, though a subset with early contracture may represent a different entity and warrants earlier intervention; neurodevelopmental comorbidities are more common among those who persist [^441f30ad] [^4d88c0f4].

> Next, I should review treatment by age and severity, and I need to ensure I align with evidence strength. For toddlers under about 3 years with normal dorsiflexion, observation and reassurance are appropriate given high spontaneous resolution. For children 3–6 years with mild contracture, home stretching and physical therapy are reasonable. For persistent toe walking with equinus beyond about 6 years or failure of conservative care, serial casting with or without botulinum toxin may be considered, though I should double-check the evidence base before recommending BTX [^2d1a262d] [^142d3edc].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought adding botulinum toxin to casting improves outcomes, but I should verify that. The randomized trial and the Cochrane review show no added benefit of BTX over casting alone for ITW, so I should correct that and avoid routine BTX unless there is a specific rationale such as spasticity or dystonia, and even then the evidence is limited in ITW populations [^fc8eb3d4] [^e05dee9c].

> I will now examine surgical options and outcomes for refractory cases. For severe, persistent ITW with fixed equinus contracture after conservative therapy, gastrocnemius recession or Achilles tendon lengthening improves ankle dorsiflexion and gait, with zone III lengthenings showing higher success and lower reintervention rates than zone II in a recent series, though long-term kinematic changes may persist even when visual gait appears normalized [^dd863019] [^e23230f1] [^eb5b948c].

> But wait, what if the child has autism spectrum disorder or other neurodevelopmental conditions. I should confirm that toe walking is more prevalent and more persistent in ASD, and that management often includes stretching, orthoses, and casting within multidisciplinary care, with attention to sensory processing and functional goals, while recognizing that the evidence base for specific ITW interventions in ASD is limited and decisions should be individualized [^24aa891b] [^3b150d60].

> I need to ensure I address quality of life and activity levels because they influence treatment decisions. Children with persistent ITW can have reduced health-related quality of life across physical, school, and emotional domains, and higher daily physical activity levels may entrench gait patterns and complicate rehabilitation, so dosing and expectations should be adjusted accordingly and shared decision-making emphasized [^25eec74f] [^e6bfcbae] [^d4d7fea9].

> Let me reconsider the overall decision algorithm to keep this practical. If the child is under 3 years with normal dorsiflexion, observe and reassure. If 3–6 years with mild equinus, use stretching and PT. If older than 6 years or with persistent equinus despite therapy, consider serial casting. If equinus remains fixed or function is impaired, refer for surgical evaluation. Throughout, screen for red flags and pursue neurologic or spinal imaging when indicated, and tailor to family preferences and activity context [^2d1a262d] [^819c95ab].

> Finally, I should double-check key controversies and evidence gaps so counseling is balanced. There is no high-certainty evidence favoring BTX for ITW, long-term recurrence after casting or surgery is variably reported and likely influenced by severity and adherence, and while most children improve spontaneously, a minority with early contracture or neurodevelopmental comorbidity may require earlier intervention; shared decision-making and realistic goals are essential to avoid overtreatment while preventing secondary complications [^e05dee9c] [^441f30ad] [^2d1a262d].

---

Pediatric toe walking is most often **idiopathic and benign**, resolving spontaneously in many children by age 5–6 [^441f30ad] [^4d88c0f4]. Persistent toe walking beyond age 3 warrants evaluation to exclude neurologic or developmental causes such as cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy, or autism spectrum disorder [^4e5e7ea1] [^24aa891b]. Management is **guided by age, severity, and underlying cause**: observation and stretching for mild cases, serial casting or botulinum toxin for persistent equinus, and surgery (gastrocnemius recession or Achilles lengthening) for fixed contractures or refractory cases [^2d1a262d] [^e05dee9c] [^dd863019]. Early intervention helps prevent contractures and gait abnormalities, and prognosis is excellent with appropriate care [^2d1a262d].

---

## Classification and etiology

Pediatric toe walking is classified into **idiopathic** and **secondary** forms. Idiopathic toe walking (ITW) is a diagnosis of exclusion, characterized by persistent toe walking without identifiable neurologic or musculoskeletal pathology [^2d1a262d]. Secondary toe walking results from underlying conditions such as:

- **Neurologic disorders**: Cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy, peripheral neuropathy, hereditary spastic paraparesis, autism spectrum disorder [^4e5e7ea1] [^24aa891b].
- **Musculoskeletal abnormalities**: Congenital short Achilles tendon, limb length discrepancy, foot deformities [^notfound].
- **Sensory processing disorders**: Often associated with autism spectrum disorder [^24aa891b].

---

## Epidemiology

The prevalence of ITW varies with age: approximately 5% at 5.5 years [^441f30ad], 2% at 7 years, and 1% at 10 years. Most children spontaneously resolve by age 10, though persistence beyond this age may indicate underlying pathology [^441f30ad].

---

## Clinical evaluation

A thorough clinical evaluation is essential to differentiate idiopathic from secondary toe walking. Key components include:

- **History**: Age of onset, developmental milestones, family history, birth history, and associated symptoms (e.g. delayed speech, regression) [^2d1a262d].
- **Physical examination**: Gait analysis, passive ankle dorsiflexion (Silfverskiöld test), muscle tone, reflexes, and neurologic assessment [^2d1a262d].
- **Imaging**: Not routinely indicated unless secondary causes are suspected. MRI may be considered for suspected neurologic or spinal pathology [^819c95ab].

---

## Natural history

ITW often resolves spontaneously, with 79% of children ceasing toe walking by age 10 without intervention [^441f30ad]. Persistent toe walking beyond age 3 warrants further evaluation to exclude underlying conditions [^036af8ed].

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on age, severity, and underlying cause:

| **Intervention** | **Indication** | **Description** |
|-|-|-|
| Observation and stretching | Mild cases, young children | - Reassurance <br/> - Home stretching exercises <br/> - Regular follow-up [^2d1a262d] |
| Serial casting | Persistent equinus contracture | - Gradual correction of ankle dorsiflexion <br/> - Typically 4–6 weeks <br/> - Followed by bracing [^2d1a262d] |
| Botulinum toxin injections | Persistent equinus with dynamic spasticity | - Temporary reduction of muscle tone <br/> - Facilitates stretching and casting <br/> - Evidence limited [^e05dee9c] |
| Surgical intervention | Fixed contractures, refractory cases | - Gastrocnemius recession or Achilles tendon lengthening <br/> - Excellent outcomes with proper rehabilitation [^dd863019] [^e23230f1] |

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis is **generally excellent** with appropriate management. Early intervention prevents contractures and gait abnormalities, and most children achieve normal gait patterns. Persistent cases may require ongoing therapy or surgical intervention, but outcomes remain favorable [^2d1a262d].

---

## Potential complications

Untreated persistent toe walking can lead to:

- **Equinus contracture**: Shortening of the Achilles tendon, limiting dorsiflexion [^9755b5f9].
- **Gait abnormalities**: Compensatory changes, increased energy expenditure, and balance issues [^e23230f1].
- **Musculoskeletal pain**: Calf muscle tightness, foot and ankle pain [^notfound].
- **Functional impairment**: Difficulty with activities of daily living, social stigma, and reduced quality of life [^25eec74f].

---

## Conclusion

Pediatric toe walking is a common gait abnormality, most often idiopathic and self-resolving. Persistent cases require evaluation to exclude underlying neurologic or musculoskeletal conditions. Management is **individualized**, ranging from observation to surgical intervention, with excellent prognosis when appropriately treated [^2d1a262d].

## References

### Cerebral palsy and toe-walking… [^1cc7fec3]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

A few readers of the article on cerebral palsy have indicated that persistent toe-walking may be a "normal" phenomenon. I know of no reported series of normal children who toe-walked at preschool age and older. In my own experience, walking intermittently on the toes without an obvious organic cause does occur. It probably reflects a mannerism whose dynamics remain unexplained. The concern is that persistent toe-walking without an evident organic cause may lead to heel cord contractures. Also, I have noted that toe-walking is seen in children who have personality, behavior, and/or learning problems. Admittedly, this association may simply reflect the type of children referred to me and cannot be applicable to the general population.

I have speculated that if toe-walking in beginning walkers reflects the infant's compensatory attempt to throw his or her center of balance behind the hips so as not to fall forward when trying to establish walking balance, then, in those infants with subtle neuromotor balance problems, toe-walking may persist longer than usual. One might further speculate that, in spite of final maturation leading to better balance, toe-walking, which becomes unnecessary for balance, is continued as a "habit. " Comments.

### Idiopathic toe walking: an update on natural history, diagnosis, and treatment [^2d1a262d]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2022). Medium credibility.

Toe walking is a common presenting report to an orthopaedic practice. Evaluation of a child with toe walking includes a thorough history and physical examination to elucidate the diagnosis. When no other diagnosis is suspected, a diagnosis of idiopathic toe walking is often given. Despite the high prevalence of the condition, there is notable controversy of the nomenclature of the disease. Recent research has shed more light on both the natural history and the genetic basis. The use of motion analysis, including EMG and multisegment foot model, may help both differentiate children with mild forms of cerebral palsy and evaluate outcomes after treatment. Early treatment for young children with adequate range of motion (ROM) is generally reassurance because most young children with idiopathic toe walking are expected to resolve spontaneously. When the toe walking persists, treatment options include both surgical and nonsurgical management. Nonsurgical management centers on obtaining ROM through stretching and serial casting, followed by gait retraining and bracing treatment. Surgical lengthening at either the Achilles or gastrocnemius level improves the ROM of the ankle and then similarly requires therapy and bracing treatment to obtain a more normalized gait.

### Fifteen-minute consultation: a child with toe walking [^9755b5f9]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2015). Low credibility.

Toe walking is a common developmental phenomenon in young children. It is usually benign and self-limiting. Toe walking can be a presenting sign of some serious underlying disorders and idiopathic toe walking is a diagnosis of exclusion. Persistent toe walking can lead to limited ankle dorsiflexion which may cause functional problems. Specific interventions depend on underlying cause and may range from verbal reinforcement to serial casting and surgery.

### Idiopathic toe walking [^142d3edc]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2012). Low credibility.

Toe walking is a bilateral gait abnormality in which a normal heel strike is absent and most weight bearing occurs through the forefoot. This abnormality may not be pathologic in patients aged < 2 years, but it is a common reason for referral to an orthopaedic surgeon. Toe walking can be caused by several neurologic and developmental abnormalities and may be the first sign of a global developmental problem. Cases that lack a definitive etiology are categorized as idiopathic. A detailed history, with careful documentation of the developmental history, and a thorough physical examination are required in the child with a primary report of toe walking. Treatment is based on age and the severity of the abnormality. Management includes observation, stretching, casting, bracing, chemodenervation, and surgical lengthening of the gastrocnemius-soleus complex and/or Achilles tendon. An understanding of idiopathic toe walking as well as treatment options and their outcomes can help the physician individualize treatment to achieve optimal results.

### Toe walking: when Do we need to worry? [^036af8ed]. Current Problems in Pediatric and Adolescent Health Care (2017). Low credibility.

Toe walking refers to the lack of heel strike during the stance phase of the gait cycle. It is a common variation of normal gait development in children. Persistent toe walking past 2–3 years of age warrants further evaluation as toe walking can be associated with cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy, and autism spectrum disorders. The diagnosis of idiopathic toe walking is a diagnosis of exclusion used for children with persistent toe walking and no associated medical condition. Despite variable pathophysiology, the treatment of toe walking has similarities across diagnoses as it is focused on the maintenance of range of motion through the ankle.

Aims

The aim of this study was to gain a consensus for best practice of the assessment and management of children with idiopathic toe walking (ITW) in order to provide a benchmark for practitioners and guide the best consistent care.

Methods

An established Delphi approach with predetermined steps and degree of agreement based on a standardized protocol was used to determine consensus. The steering group members and Delphi survey participants included members from the British Society of Children's Orthopaedic Surgery (BSCOS) and the Association of Paediatric Chartered Physiotherapists (APCP). The statements included definition, assessment, treatment indications, nonoperative and operative interventions, and outcomes. Descriptive statistics were used for analysis of the Delphi survey results. The AGREE checklist was followed for reporting the results.

Results

A total of 227 participants (54% APCP and 46% BSCOS members) completed the first round, and 222 participants (98%) completed the second round. Out of 54 proposed statements included in the first round Delphi, 17 reached 'consensus in', no statements reached 'consensus out', and 37 reached 'no consensus'. These 37 statements were then discussed, reworded, amalgamated, or deleted before the second round Delphi of 29 statements. A total of 12 statements reached 'consensus in', four 'consensus out', and 13 'no consensus'. In the final consensus meeting, 13 statements were voted upon. Five were accepted, resulting in a total of 31 approved statements.

Conclusion

In the aspects of practice where sufficient evidence is not available, a consensus statement can provide a strong body of opinion that acts as a benchmark for excellence in clinical care. This statement can assist clinicians managing children with ITW to ensure consistent and reliable practice, and reduce geographical variability in practice and outcomes. It will enable those treating ITW to share the published consensus document with both carers and patient groups.

### Interventions for idiopathic toe walking [^e05dee9c]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Idiopathic toe walking (ITW) is an exclusionary diagnosis given to healthy children who persist in walking on their toes after they should typically have achieved a heel-toe gait. The literature discusses conservative and surgical interventions using a variety of treatment modalities. Young children and children without a limitation in ankle dorsiflexion (the upwards movement of the foot towards the shin of the leg) are commonly treated with conservative interventions. Older children who continue toe walking and present with limitations in ankle dorsiflexion are sometimes treated with surgical procedures. This systematic review is needed to evaluate the evidence for any intervention for the treatment of ITW. The conclusions of this review may support decision making by clinicians caring for children with ITW. It may also assist families when deciding on treatment options for their children with ITW. Many of the treatments employed have financial implications for parents or healthcare services. This review also aims to highlight any deficits in the current research base.

Objectives

To assess the effects of conservative and surgical interventions in children with ITW, specifically effects on gait normalisation, ankle range of motion, pain, frequency of recurrence, and any adverse effects.

Search Methods

On 29 April 2019, we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL Plus, and PEDro. We searched the following registers of clinical trials for ongoing and recently completed trials: the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP, apps.who.int/trialsearch), and ClinicalTrials.gov (clinicaltrials.gov). We searched conference proceedings and other grey literature in the BIOSIS databases and System for Information on Grey Literature in Europe (OpenGrey, opengrey.eu). We searched guidelines via the Turning Research Into Practice database (TRIP, tripdatabase.com) and National Guideline Clearinghouse (guideline.gov). We did not apply language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We considered randomised or quasi-randomised trials for inclusion in the review if they involved participants diagnosed with ITW gait in the absence of a medical condition known to cause toe walking, or associated with toe walking. As there is no universally accepted age group for ITW, this review includes ITW at any age, who have been toe walking for more than six months, who can or cannot walk with a heel-toe gait, and who may or may not have limited dorsiflexion of the ankle joint.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. The primary outcome was improvement in toe walking (defined as greater than 50% of time spent heel-toe walking). Secondary outcomes were active and passive range of motion of the ankle joint, pain, recurrence of ITW after treatment, and adverse events. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE framework.

Main Results

Four studies, comprising 104 participants, met the inclusion criteria. One study did not report data within the appropriate follow-up timeframe and data from two studies were insufficient for analysis. The single study from which we extracted data had 47 participants and was a randomised, controlled, parallel-group trial conducted in Sweden. It tested the hypothesis that combined treatment with serial casting and botulinum toxin type A (BTX) was more effective than serial casting alone in reducing ITW gait. This study found that more participants treated with BTX improved (defined as toe walking less than 50% of the time, as reported by parents) (risk ratio (RR) 1.21, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57 to 2.55; 1 trial, 46 participants; very low-certainty evidence). However, there was little or no difference between groups in passive ankle joint dorsiflexion range of movement on the right with the knee extended (mean difference (MD) -1.48º, 95% CI -4.13 to 1.16; 1 trial, 47 participants), on the right with the knee flexed (MD -0.04º, 95% CI -1.80 to 1.73; 1 trial, 46 participants), on the left with the knee flexed (MD 1.07, 95% CI -1.22 to 3.37), or on the left with the knee extended (MD 0.05, 95% CI -0.91 to 1.91). Nor was there a clear difference between the groups in recurrence of toe-walking gait (assessed via severity of toe walking (graded 1 (mild), 2 (moderate), or 3 (severe)) on gait analysis, analysed as continuous data: MD 0.34 points, 95% CI -0.09 to 0.78; 46 participants). In principle, MDs greater than zero (i.e.) positive values) would favour BTX and casting and negative values would favour casting alone. We have not reported effects as better or worse because all results were from evidence of very low certainty. We downgraded the certainty of evidence because of study limitations (outcome assessment was not blinded) and imprecision. Outcomes of pain and active range of motion were not reported in the included study. In terms of adverse events, calf pain was reported twice in the casting-only group and three times in the BTX group. There were three minor skin problems in each group and one reported case of pain directly after BTX injection. The report did not state if calf pain and skin irritation were from the same or different participants. The study authors reported that adverse events did not alter treatment adherence.

Authors' Conclusions

The certainty of evidence from one study, which compared serial casting with serial casting with BTX for ITW in children, was too low for conclusions to be drawn. A further three studies reported outcomes relating to BTX, footwear, exercises, and different types of orthoses as interventions, however the outcome data were too limited to assess their effects.

### Persistent toe walking in autism [^45ed5725]. Journal of Child Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

The records of 954 ambulatory children presenting for initial evaluation to a university developmental pediatrician were reviewed for the prevalence of persistent toe walking and associated tight heel cords. The incidence of persistent toe walking (20.1%) and tight heel cords (12.0%) were found to be higher in 324 children with an autistic spectrum disorder but lower (10.0%/3.0%) in 30 children with Asperger syndrome. These results confirm the previously reported high incidence of toe walking in children with autism and with language disorders and also raise the possibility of a secondary orthopedic deformity that can complicate long-term management of these patients.

### Surgical outcomes for severe idiopathic toe walkers [^dd863019]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Idiopathic toe walking (ITW) is a diagnosis of exclusion and represents a spectrum of severity. Treatment for ITW includes observation and a variety of conservative treatment methods, with surgical intervention often reserved for severe cases. Previous studies reviewing treatment outcomes are often difficult to interpret secondary to a mixture of case severity. The goal of this study was to review surgical outcomes in patients with severe ITW who had failed prior conservative treatment, as well as determine differences in outcomes based on the type of surgery performed.

Methods

After IRB approval, all patients with surgical management of severe ITW at a single institution were identified. Zone II or zone III plantar flexor lengthenings were performed in all subjects. Clinical, radiographic, and motion analysis data were collected preoperatively and at 1 year following surgery.

Results

Twenty-six patients (46 extremities) with a diagnosis of severe ITW from 2002 to 2017 were included. Zone II lengthenings were performed in 25 extremities (mean age = 9.9y) and zone III lengthenings were performed in 21 extremities (mean age = 8.6y). At the most recent follow-up, 100% of zone III lengthening extremities and 88% of zone II lengthening demonstrated decreased severity of ITW. Six extremities required additional treatment, all of which were initially managed with zone II lengthenings.

Conclusions

Severe ITW or ITW that has not responded to conservative treatment may benefit from surgical intervention. More successful outcomes, including continued resolution of toe walking, were observed in subjects treated with zone III lengthenings.

### Physical activity and quality of life in children with idiopathic toe walking: a cross sectional study [^e6bfcbae]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

ITW is thought to be a benign and transient gait pattern requiring minimal intervention from health professionals. Although some children may reduce or cease toe walking as they get older, for those that continue, the high level of MVPA undertaken may further ingrain this gait pattern. If high levels of daily physical activity are present, this may impact the efficacy of exercise dosage or therapy type on influencing impairment or functional outcomes. The impact of persistent toe walking on quality of life may also need to be considered when approaching a decision to treat.

### Diagnosis and management of common foot fractures [^f15fffb2]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Foot fractures are among the most common foot injuries evaluated by primary care physicians. They most often involve the metatarsals and toes. Patients typically present with varying signs and symptoms, the most common being pain and trouble with ambulation. Diagnosis requires radiographic evaluation, although emerging evidence demonstrates that ultrasonography may be just as accurate. Management is determined by the location of the fracture and its effect on balance and weight bearing. Metatarsal shaft fractures are initially treated with a posterior splint and avoidance of weight-bearing activities; subsequent treatment consists of a short leg walking cast or boot for four to six weeks. Proximal fifth metatarsal fractures have different treatments depending on the location of the fracture. A fifth metatarsal tuberosity avulsion fracture can be treated acutely with a compressive dressing, then the patient can be transitioned to a short leg walking boot for two weeks, with progressive mobility as tolerated after initial immobilization. A Jones fracture has a higher risk of nonunion and requires at least six to eight weeks in a short leg non-weight-bearing cast; healing time can be as long as 10 to 12 weeks. Great toe fractures are treated with a short leg walking boot or cast with toe plate for two to three weeks, then a rigid-sole shoe for an additional three to four weeks. Lesser toe fractures can be treated with buddy taping and a rigid-sole shoe for four to six weeks.

### In-toeing is often a primary care orthopedic condition [^85dd0f88]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate in-toeing consults to a pediatric orthopedic clinic to determine the proportion that could be managed by a primary care physician.

Study Design

A prospective registry was created for 143 consecutive children referred to a pediatric orthopedic clinic for "in-toeing". Each patient underwent a careful history and physical examination, which included a rotational profile. We recorded the final diagnosis, treatment offered, follow-up visit results, and the source of the referral.

Results

After pediatric orthopedic evaluation, 85% of patients had a confirmed diagnosis of in-toeing, and 15% had a different final diagnosis. Seventy-four percent of patients had 1 consultation visit, 18% had 2, and 8% had > 2 visits. None of the referred patients was a candidate for treatment by casting or surgery.

Conclusion

In most cases, in-toeing is a normal variation of development that can be managed by counseling and observation by the primary care physician alone. Rare cases of severe in-toeing > 2 standard deviations from the mean should likely still prompt referral to a pediatric orthopedic surgeon for potential intervention.

### MRI of the spine in patients who toe walk: is there a role? [^819c95ab]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Little is known about the prevalence of intraspinal pathology in children who toe walk, but magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be part of the diagnostic workup. The purpose of this study was to examine the role of MRI for children who toe walk with a focus on the rate of positive findings and associated neurosurgical interventions performed for children with said MRI findings.

Methods

A single-center tertiary hospital database was queried to identify a cohort of 118 subjects with a diagnosis of toe walking who underwent spinal MRI during a 5-year period. Patient and MRI characteristics were summarized and compared between subjects with a major abnormality, minor abnormality, or no abnormality on MRI using multivariable logistic regression. Major MRI abnormalities included those with a clear spinal etiology, such as fatty filum, tethered cord, syrinx, and Chiari malformation, while minor abnormalities had unclear associations with toe walking.

Results

The most common primary indications for MRI were failure to improve with conservative treatment, severe contracture, and abnormal reflexes. The prevalence of major MRI abnormalities was 25% (30/118), minor MRI abnormalities was 19% (22/118), and normal MRI was 56% (66/118). Patients with delayed onset of toe walking were significantly more likely to have a major abnormality on MRI (P = 0.009). The presence of abnormal reflexes, severe contracture, back pain, bladder incontinence, and failure to improve with conservative treatment were not significantly associated with an increased likelihood of major abnormality on MRI. Twenty-nine (25%) subjects underwent tendon lengthening, and 5 (4%) underwent neurosurgical intervention, the most frequent of which was detethering and sectioning of fatty filum.

Conclusions

Spinal MRI in patients who toe walk has a high rate of major positive findings, some of which require neurosurgical intervention. The most significant predictor of intraspinal pathology was the late onset of toe walking after the child had initiated walking. MRI of the spine should be considered by pediatric orthopedic surgeons in patients with toe walking who present late with an abnormal clinical course.

### Simplified approach to idiopathic toe-walking [^db5739b5]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2001). Low credibility.

Controversy exists as to the treatment of idiopathic toe-walking (ITW). Since 1993, the authors have managed children with ITW using an outpatient percutaneous lengthening of the Achilles tendon, followed by placement of below-knee walking casts for 4 weeks. The authors reviewed 15 children who were treated for ITW with percutaneous Achilles tendon lengthening between 1993 and 1999. Ten of the 15 patients could be contacted for a follow-up survey. None of the parents stated that their child's toe-walking had recurred. There were no painful scars. All of the children were able to keep up with other children and did not notice any calf weakness. Two children had occasional Achilles tendinitis, which was relieved with antiinflammatory medications. All parents were satisfied with their child's outcome. The authors believe that percutaneous tendo-Achilles lengthening in ITW greatly simplifies the management of ITW.

### Fifteen-minute consultation: the limping child [^90331852]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2020). Medium credibility.

The limping child is a common presentation to paediatric services. In most instances the cause is benign with few, if any, investigations required. There is, however, always that concern that the limping child may have an underlying limb-threatening or life-threatening disease. This poses a challenge to clinicians, who must find that balance between correctly identifying disease early and avoiding the risks and harms of overinvestigation.

### Spectrum of diagnosis and disposition of patients referred to a pediatric orthopaedic center for a diagnosis of intoeing [^74fe6dbd]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Orthopaedic surgeons frequently evaluate otherwise healthy children for concern of intoed gait. Intoeing in otherwise healthy young children due to metatarsus adductus, internal tibial torsion, and increased femoral anteversion do not typically require orthopaedic treatment. This study reviewed the actual diagnosis, management, and disposition of patients referred to a pediatric orthopaedic specialty hospital for a diagnosis of intoeing; the efficacy of an Advanced Practice Provider (APP) assessment program to screen and triage patients with a primary complaint of intoeing; and parental satisfaction with that program.

Methods

We established an "Intoeing Clinic" conducted by APPs to conduct initial evaluations of patients referred for a diagnosis of intoeing meeting-specific criteria, including (1) a referring provider's diagnosis of "intoeing"; (2) the patient was under the age of 9 years; and (3) there was no suggestion of comorbidity in the information provided by the referring provider to imply a diagnosis other than "benign" intoeing. Under pediatric orthopaedic surgeon "on-call" supervision, APPs were authorized to perform clinical assessments supplemented by radiographs and laboratory investigations as deemed necessary. We performed an Institutional Review Board-approved, retrospective medical record review of all patients appointed to our Intoeing Clinic over a 30-month period (March 2010 to September 2013).

Results

About 95% of 926 patients appointed to APP Intoeing Clinic were confirmed to have a diagnosis of "benign" intoeing or a similar "benign" diagnosis; 5% of these patients requested a reevaluation for the same concern. Approximately 5% were determined to have a nonbenign diagnosis, either known to the family/provider, but not conveyed at the time of referral (4%), or identified at our institution (1%). Two patients (0.2%) were determined at follow-up examination to have a neurological abnormality at the subsequent examination.

Conclusions

An "Intoeing Clinic" staffed by experienced Advanced Pediatric Practitioners or equivalent, with appropriate orthopaedic surgeon availability for consultation can be an effective and efficient method of evaluating patients referred for a diagnosis of "intoeing".

### Toe walking: a neurological perspective after referral from pediatric orthopaedic surgeons [^4e5e7ea1]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Toe walking (TW) in children is often idiopathic in origin. Our purpose was to determine the incidence of a neurological etiology for TW in patients seen in the neurology clinic after referral from pediatric orthopaedic surgeons.

Methods

We performed an Institutional Review Board approved retrospective review of 174 patients referred to the neurology clinic from orthopaedic surgeons at an academic pediatric tertiary care center between January 2010 and September 2015. Medical records were reviewed and data recorded including pertinent family history, birth history, age of initial ambulation, physical examination findings, and workup results including neuroimaging, neurophysiological studies, and findings of genetic testing and tissue biopsy.

Results

Sixty-two percent (108/174) of patients were found to have a neurological etiology for TW. Final pathologic diagnoses were: 37% (40/108) previously undiagnosed cerebral palsy (CP), 16.7% (18/108) peripheral neuropathy, 15.7% (17/108) autism spectrum disorder, 13.9% (15/108) hereditary spastic paraparesis, 8.3% (9/108) attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, 5.6% (6/108) syndromic diagnosis, and 2.8% (3/108) spinal cord abnormality. Ankle equinus contractures were noted in idiopathic and neurological patients and did not indicate a pathologic origin. Seventy-one percent of unilateral toe walkers and 32% of bilateral but asymmetric toe walkers were diagnosed with CP (P < 0.001). Twenty-six percent of 145 brain magnetic resonance imaging studies diagnosed CP. Of the 125 (72%) with spinal imaging, 3 had spinal pathology to account for TW. Fourteen percent of 87 subjects with an electromyography/nerve conduction study had abnormal results indicating a peripheral polyneuropathy.

Conclusions

An underlying pathologic diagnosis was found in 62% of patients referred to neurology for TW. A concerning birth history, delayed initial ambulation, unilateral TW, upper or lower motor neuron signs on examination, or behavioral features may suggest a pathologic diagnosis. Ankle contracture is not predictive of an abnormal diagnosis and can be found in idiopathic patients. CP, peripheral neuropathy, autism spectrum disorder, and hereditary spastic paraparesis are the most common pathologic diagnoses identified in our population.

### Attaining a British consensus on managing idiopathic congenital talipes equinovarus up to walking age [^3c40f851]. The Bone & Joint Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The gold standard for the management of idiopathic CTEV is the Ponseti method, which includes correction of the deformity through serial manipulation and casting, a percutaneous tenotomy in the majority of patients, followed by a maintenance period in a FAB. In this paper, the Ponseti method of treatment of a child with a CTEV is not in question, but the details of how this treatment is applied are. These details include the timing of procedures, as well as the local set-up for treating the child with a CTEV. This is because although often referred to as 'The Ponseti Method', it may differ widely throughout the country, resulting in varying effects on both the patient's experience and indeed their final outcomes. It is our premise that by creating a consensus in the details of the assessment, correction, and maintenance of the corrected foot will improve the overall level of care and outcomes of CTEV treatment. We present the results of a complete consensus statement following the Delphi process. The consensus includes the holistic approach to managing infants with CTEV and their families through the referral process, and incorporates the assessment of the infant as a whole, the deformity correction and maintenance, as well as the management of early relapse. This process has highlighted several issues that are considered important by BSCOS members, emphasizing the need for attention to detail and optimization of every stage.

### What is new in pediatric orthopaedic foot and ankle [^1e7d5a07]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

This paper aims to report on the last 5 years of relevant research on pediatric foot and ankle pathology with specific focus on clubfoot, congenital vertical talus, toe walking, tarsal coalitions, pes planovalgus with or without accessory navicular, foot and ankle trauma, and talar dome osteochondritis dessicans.

Methods

The Browzine platform was used to review the table of contents for all papers published in the following target journals related to the treatment of pediatric foot and ankle conditions. Search results were further refined to include clinical trials and randomized controlled trials published from March 1, 2015 to November 15, 2021.

Results

A total of 73 papers were selected for review based on new findings and significant contributions in treatment of clubfoot, congenital vertical talus, toe walking, tarsal coalitions, pes planovalgus with or without accessory navicular, foot and ankle trauma, and talar dome osteochondritis dessicans. Also included were several papers that did not fit into any of these categories but provided new insight into specific foot and ankle pathologies.

Conclusions

Treatment strategies for children with foot and ankle pathology are continually evolving. We review many of the most recent publications with the goal of improving understanding of these pathologies and highlighting current best practices.

In normal walking, 60% of time is spent in the stance phase (25% double stance) and 40% in the swing phase. The stance phase includes heel strike, foot flat, heel rise and toe off. Altered gait may be due to truncal or lower limb malalignment, lower extremity muscle weakness, joint instability, limited joint range of motion, and/or pain.

Investigations

Laboratory tests are almost never necessary in evaluating a patient with foot or ankle pain. CBC, ESR or CRP, blood and joint cultures should be done if infection is suspected. Arthritis is a clinical diagnosis; anti-nuclear antibody (ANA), rheumatoid factor and HLA-B27 are helpful in classification and treatment but not diagnosis. CBC, peripheral smear should be done if hematological malignancy is suspected.

### Idiopathic toe-walking: prevalence and natural history from birth to ten years of age [^441f30ad]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Children with idiopathic toe-walking, a common pediatric condition, walk some or all of the time on their toes. This condition often causes parental concern, with repeated medical contacts and a range of interventions including stretching, casts, injection of botulinum toxin A, and surgical procedures. The purpose of this cohort study was to document the natural history of this condition.

Methods

In a population-based cohort of 1,401 healthy 5.5-year-old Swedish children, we found the prevalence of idiopathic toe-walking to be approximately 5% (63 of 1,401). Of the 63 children who had ever been a toe-walker, 26 still were at the age of 5.5 years and were followed in the current study at 8 and 10 years of age. At the 8-year follow-up, parents were asked by telephone whether their child had received any treatment or diagnosis since the 5.5-year assessment, as well as to what extent (approximately 25%, 50%, 75%, or 100% of the time) the child still walked on the toes. At the visit when the children were 10 years of age, their parents were asked the same questions. All 26 children also underwent a neurological examination and an orthopaedic examination focusing on the lower extremities.

Results

At 8 years of age, 6 of 26 children had ceased toe-walking, and by the age of 10 years, 50 (79%) of the original 63 patients had spontaneously ceased toe-walking. Idiopathic toe-walking did not result in contractures of the triceps surae. One subgroup of children displayed early contracture of the ankle and should thus not be considered idiopathic toe-walkers. Four of the children who still toe-walked at the age of 10 years demonstrated some neurodevelopmental comorbidity.

Conclusions

By the age of 10 years, 79% of the children who have ever been a toe-walker spontaneously develop a typical gait, without intervention or contractures of the ankle dorsiflexion. The diagnosis of short tendo Achilles should be retained as a separate diagnosis as there is a subset of children with this entity who should be treated early in childhood. Neurodevelopmental comorbidities are common among those who continue to toe-walk.

### Executive summary: the British Society for Rheumatology guideline for the management of foot health in inflammatory arthritis [^99bf0577]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

The guideline

Recommendations for assessment and diagnosis

Assessment

1. In adults, children and young people with suspected or confirmed IA, questions relating to foot symptoms should be asked at each visit and, if appropriate, clinical examination of the foot should be undertaken, including disease activity, deformities, foot posture, musculoskeletal function, gait assessment, footwear, range of motion, vascular and neurological status, and skin and nail pathologies. SOR: 1; LOE: B/C; SOA: 92.

Rationale

The SOR is based on cross-sectional studies and expert consensus. Clinical assessment should be patient-centred and guided by symptoms and concerns; foot symptoms should prompt a detailed assessment of disease activity, including palpation of the foot joints for localized swelling and tenderness. There is weak evidence from cross-sectional studies for the specificity of the MTP joint squeeze test to identify synovitis in patients with suspected IA, but the test has been shown to lack sensitivity. Foot posture, deformities, gait, range of motion, skin, toenails, and neurological and vascular status should be assessed, and footwear/insoles physically examined.

In children and young people with IA specifically, age and developmental stage should be considered. Foot joints should be assessed as part of Juvenile Arthritis Disease Activity Score-71 (JADAS-71) and paediatric Gait Arms Legs and SPine (pGALS) screening.

Imaging

2. Health professionals managing adults, children and young people with suspected or confirmed IA should have access to appropriate imaging (including X-ray, ultrasound (US), computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)) to assess foot health, to inform clinical management. SOR: 1; LOE: B/C; SOA: 99.

Rationale

The SOR is based on cross-sectional, cohort and case-control studies, and expert opinion. X-ray, CT, US or MRI may be most appropriate depending on the clinical scenario. MRI is considered the reference standard modality for imaging synovitis and tenosynovitis in IA, and is more sensitive than conventional radiographs for the detection of inflammation. To assess foot health specifically, there is weak evidence for the use of MRI and US. Anyone who performs US should undertake a recognized formal training programme. Recommendations relating to imaging in other IA guidelines should be considered.

### Attaining a British consensus on managing idiopathic congenital talipes equinovarus up to walking age [^08876086]. The Bone & Joint Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Target users' preferences and views

The target users are all CTEV practitioners involved in the management of children with CTEV as well as general practitioners (GPs), patient and family groups, and hospital managers involved in planning and budgeting Ponseti clinics. The consensus statements will be shared with carers and parents to improve their knowledge and manage their expectations.

Preference of treatment and views were sought by evidence from the literature, expert opinions from practitioners who formed the steering group, and from all BSCOS members in the form of the Delphi survey. The first steering meeting focused on the process and divided the consensus statement into six successive stages: referral pathways and initial assessment, clinic set-up, the casting process, tenotomy, foot abduction brace (FAB), and relapse. The subsequent meetings continued the brainstorming sessions and discussed each section in detail and prepared statements for the Delphi survey. Between Delphi round 1 and 2, the steering group reassessed and modified the statements that did not reach consensus. The final consensus meeting followed the Delphi survey. In the final meeting, the statements that reached consensus were approved, and the statements that did not reach consensus were discussed in depth and voted upon in order to decide whether there was merit in including them.

Rigour of development

The consensus statement is based on the practice and expertise of the participating BSCOS members. The topics were discussed and scrutinized against the up-to-date literature during the steering group meetings.

### Spasticity: orthopedic perspective [^411c0438]. Journal of Child Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

The orthopedic management of spasticity is based on the effects of this neurologic condition on the bones and tissues of the growing child. The goal of such intervention is to maximize function, reduce disability, and facilitate mobility. Goal-directed treatment plans are tailored for each patient and may include a combination of modalities such as physical and occupational therapy, casting, orthoses, and surgery. Physical and occupational therapy is emphasized up to 4 to 5 years of age, whereas surgery is best between 5 and 7 years of age. Education and psychosocial development should be emphasized beginning at age 7 years through adulthood, with surgery reserved for more involved cases of contracture or bony dysplasia. In adulthood, treatment should be focused on integration into society and maximizing functional independence. Although there are many undisputed benefits of therapy, no consensus exists regarding the most beneficial modality, the age group that would benefit most, or whether continued treatment is beneficial in adulthood. Whereas the use of serial casting and tone-reducing casts has lessened, lower extremity orthoses have gained widespread acceptance with improvements in design and fabrication and have been demonstrated to help restore normal heel-toe gait. Surgical techniques such as tendon lengthening, transfer, bony osteotomy, and joint fusion are time-honored techniques that continue to be refined with current advances in the use of computerized gait analysis for preoperative planning. Further research in long-term results and outcomes measurement will be necessary to fully assess the impact of current treatment.

### Attaining a British consensus on managing idiopathic congenital talipes equinovarus up to walking age [^19bb46dc]. The Bone & Joint Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

The study protocol, including methods and timeline, was previously published at the start of the study to ensure that the predefined protocol would be followed. A summary of these stages is reported below. The Appraisal of Guidelines for Research & Evaluation checklist was used as the principle for result reporting.

A four-stage process was followed: establishing a steering group; steering group meetings, generating statements, and checking these statements against the published literature; a two-round Delphi survey; and the final consensus meeting. Participants were asked to score each outcome in the survey using a Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) scale, which ranges from 1 to 9 (1 to 3, not important; 4 to 6, important but not critical; and 7 to 9, critical for inclusion). The definition of consensus is presented in Table I.

Population

The consensus document applied to all patients with primary idiopathic CTEV of any severity under walking age. It does not apply to patients with neuromuscular CTEV, spina bifida, arthrogryposis, or any other cause of secondary CTEV. The statements do not cover the management of children with non-idiopathic clubfoot or any children after walking age.

### Physical activity and quality of life in children with idiopathic toe walking: a cross sectional study [^b640edcb]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

This study was cross–sectional in design, and was approved by the Monash Health Human Research Ethics Committee (MHREC:15405A). All parents/carers of participants provided written informed consent, and child participants verbally assented prior to participation. This present study was nested within a larger study exploring the strength and range of motion of foot and leg muscles of children with an ITW gait. Data collection about physical activity and quality of life was the secondary outcome of the larger study examining potential physical features associated with the gait.

Patient and public involvement

There was no patient or public involvement in the design of this study. Parents of participants were provided with summary outcomes if requested.

Participants

Participants were recruited from private practice clinics, public health outpatient and community clinics via advertising to clinicians. Eligible participants were between 4 and 16 years, otherwise healthy and demonstrated a consistent ITW gait pattern. The ITW exclusionary diagnosis was made through either a multidisciplinary (medical/allied health) hospital clinic or via combined assessment by two experienced health professionals (physiotherapist and podiatrist) using a validated exclusionary tool. These assessments considered cognitive delay, gross motor skill and risk factors of the toe walking gait being related to a neurological, orthopaedic or developmental condition. Prior to inclusion, the clinicians also observed gait and that the child displayed consistent or intermittent toe walking but was able to get their heels to the ground on request. Participants were excluded if they had any active treatment prescribed by a health professional for their toe walking gait within the previous 12 months. Active treatment was considered as serial casting, surgery, gait aids or motor control interventions that were monitored and modified by a health professional. This was to minimise any confounding influence on physical activity.

Outcome measures

Participant demographics

The age (years), gender, weight (kg) using a calibrated scale (Anko Electronics, California, USA), height (m) using a stadiometer (Seca, Hamburg, Germany) of each participant were documented at an initial appointment. The data collection period in relation to local school holidays or school term was also documented.

Occupational and motor therapies — autism spectrum disorder (ASD): Both fine and gross motor skills may be delayed in preschool-aged children with ASD, and occupational therapy services may be indicated to promote fine motor and adaptive skills, including self-care, toy use, and handwriting, with almost two-thirds of preschool-aged children with ASD reported to receive such services. Toe walking is common among children with ASD, the etiology of toe walking in ASD is unclear, and common interventions may include passive stretching, orthotics, and casting. Impaired motor skills may further decrease opportunities for social skills development and active learning and may be a risk factor for overweight and obesity, and to be provided in the educational setting, a significant delay for age that affects function in school must be identified on a valid assessment measure.

Follow-up and monitoring

24. In adults, children and young people with confirmed IA, questions relating to foot symptoms should be asked at each visit and, if appropriate, clinical examination of the foot should be undertaken, including disease activity, deformities, foot posture, musculoskeletal function, footwear, gait, range of motion, vascular and neurological status, and skin and nail pathologies.

25. In young people with IA who transfer from paediatric to adult care, a multidisciplinary approach to foot health should be considered a core element of the transition process. SOR: 2; LOE: C; SOA: 98.

Rationale

There is no direct evidence for the inclusion of foot health in transitional care; the SOR is based on expert opinion. To enhance transitional care, young people with IA should be appropriately signposted to information relating to foot health, and made aware of how to access foot health services, at each visit. European Alliance for Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR)/Paediatric Rheumatology European Society (PReS) and National Confidential Enquiry into Patient Outcome and Death (NCEPOD) recommendations should be considered.

### Moving toes syndrome in children and youth: case series of a rare disorder [^b4c87e69]. Journal of Child Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

"Moving toes syndrome" is a rare movement disorder with painful and painless forms. There is a paucity of literature on patients presenting with moving toes syndrome in the first 2 decades. We present 3 cases of moving toes syndrome, with symptom onset between 9 and 19 years. Pain was variable in these patients. Etiologies included minor trauma in 2 patients and a central thalamic-hypothalamic lesion in another. Two of 3 patients required no treatment, and symptoms gradually improved. Similar to adults, children and youth with moving toes syndrome can demonstrate features that overlap with functional movement disorders. Moving toes syndrome presenting in childhood and adolescence appears to be more benign than in adults, with many patients improving over time.

SOR: 1; LOE: B/C; SOA: 92.

Rationale

The SOR is based on evidence from cross-sectional studies and expert consensus. Clinical assessment should be patient-centred and guided by symptoms and concerns. Foot symptoms should prompt a detailed clinical examination involving an assessment of disease activity, including palpation of the foot joints for localized swelling and tenderness. There is weak evidence from cross-sectional studies for the specificity of the MTP joint squeeze test to identify synovitis in patients with suspected IA, but the test has been shown to lack sensitivity. Foot posture, deformities and gait should be visually assessed, while footwear and any existing insoles should be physically examined for wear. Footwear should also be assessed for motion, width and depth, fastening mechanism and arch support. The overall condition of soft tissues and range of motion in the ankle, subtalar, midfoot and MTP joints should be assessed, in addition to the quality of this motion. Skin and toenails should be assessed for pathologies, including skin disease (e.g. psoriasis), callus, wounds and anhidrosis. An assessment of vascular status, primarily to assess for PAD, and neurological status should be performed given the increased risk of vascular disease and peripheral neuropathy in IA. Assessment findings can be augmented with imaging if appropriate (see recommendation 2). The recommendation that questions relating to foot symptoms should be asked at each visit was made in response to qualitative evidence indicating that people with IA are rarely asked about their feet.

In children and young people with IA specifically, age and developmental stage should be taken into consideration when assessing foot health. The foot joints should be assessed as part of the Juvenile Arthritis Disease Activity Score-71 (JADAS-71) and the paediatric Gait Arms Legs and Spine (pGALS) screening. The pGALS is proposed when there are indicators of potential MSK disease and includes an assessment of gait and foot posture.

Other causes of heel pain (Pathway 4) — Although less common, benign and malignant tumors, infection (soft tissue and bone), and vascular compromise must be considered as etiologies of a patient's heel pain, and the potential morbidity of these conditions is substantial. Proper diagnostic testing along with consultation or referral to the appropriate specialist are paramount in these individuals. In adolescents, calcaneal apophysitis is probably the most frequent etiology of heel pain, and palliative treatment is successful in nearly all cases.

### AbobotulinumtoxinA (dysport) improves function according to goal attainment in children with dynamic equinus due to cerebral palsy [^2c82a786]. Journal of Child Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

We have previously reported that single injections of abobotulinumtoxinA significantly improve muscle hypertonia and spasticity, resulting in a better overall global clinical outcome. The results of these secondary and exploratory analyses of goal attainment support the overall findings and confirm that treatment with abobotulinumtoxinA improved the ability of patients to achieve their treatment goals versus placebo.

Although the use of Goal Attainment Scaling as an outcome measure is now well established in studies of adult spasticity, and is validated for use in all age groups, it is a relatively underexplored concept in pediatric trials. To our knowledge, this is one of the largest pediatric cerebral palsy studies to include Goal Attainment Scaling as an outcome measure. The implementation of Goal Attainment Scaling in our protocol involved extensive training to ensure that all investigators set goals in a consistent way. This process required us to develop our goal-setting and negotiation skills into a very structured process, which takes into account what is important to the patient and what the physician and therapist believe is achievable. In our experience, the use of Goal Attainment Scaling necessitated that we modify what could be very broad goals into predefined measurable steps that enabled a better judgment of treatment response. For example, instead of setting a goal of "improved walking pattern" in a child who is constantly toe walking, the use of Goal Attainment Scaling meant that this broad goal could be broken down into objective steps such as toe walking for 50% to 75% of the time (expected attainment), toe walking for 25% to 49% of the time (somewhat better than expected attainment), and not toe walking (much better than expected attainment). Although this approach admittedly involved more time at the initial visit, the early efforts invariably saved time during the follow-up visits.

### Validation of parental reports in assessing idiopathic toe walking using quantitative in-shoe device measurements [^52b0dc4a]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Toe walking is prevalent among children, affecting 5% to 24% of the pediatric population. Clinicians rely on parental reports of frequency of toe walking to guide clinical decision making and outcomes assessment. However, recall accuracy and differing environments challenge the reliability of parental reports. This study aims to validate parental reports against quantitative in-shoe device measurements (NURVV/RUN).

Methods

Twenty children with persistent idiopathic toe walking (ITWp) (mean age: 9.6y; 13 males, 7 females) from 8 pediatric orthopaedic specialty care sites participated in this multicenter study. Parents assessed toe walking frequency using a 6-point scale, while children wore NURVV/RUN insoles for 8 hours/day over 7 days. Insole sensors recorded foot strike patterns (rearfoot, midfoot, and forefoot), which were classified using the same severity scale. Agreement between parental reports and NURVV data was assessed using weighted Kappa statistics (P < 0.05).

Results

Before intervention, children with ITWp exhibited daily walking patterns: 61.7% forefoot, 15.3% midfoot, and 22.8% hindfoot contact. Agreement analysis showed substantial agreement (k = 0.688, P < 0.001) for combined forefoot and midfoot contacts and fair agreement (k = 0.381, P < 0.005) for isolated forefoot contact.

Conclusion

Parental reports of toe walking prevalence in their children are relatively accurate, supporting their use in clinical management. However, quantitative in-shoe devices provide a more objective and quantitative understanding of ITWp frequency and have the potential to guide clinical decision-making and outcomes assessment children with ITWp.

### Transient dystonic toe-walking: differentiation from cerebral palsy and a rare explanation for some unexplained cases of idiopathic toe-walking [^1de0574c]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

We report on seven children (five males, two females) who presented with marked, often asymmetrical, toe-walking from onset of independent walking, associated with abnormal foot postures and increased tone at the ankles with characteristics of dystonia. Most of the children had presented with unusual pre-walking locomotion and a mild delay in independent walking. They did not fit into the usual categories of 'habitual' toe-walking or congenital short tendo calcaneus but nor did they have the clinical signs of spastic diplegia or of a peripheral neuromuscular disease. Normalization occurred progressively in the second to fourth years of life. The children were re-examined several years later (1 to 11y) and were normal. We believe that their persistent toe-walking corresponded to a variant of 'transient focal dystonia of infancy'. Knowledge of its existence may justify a period of observation without special investigations, surgery, or casting.

### The prevalence of persistent toe walking in children with and without autism spectrum disorder and the odds of subsequent surgery [^3b150d60]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Persistent toe walking is associated with autism spectrum disorder. The true prevalence of persistent toe walking and odds of progression to surgery in children with and without autism remains unclear. This retrospective descriptive study identified patients ages 3 to 17 years who were enrolled in our healthcare system over a 2-year period. Using international classification of disease codes, we identified all children with autism and persistent toe walking, and excluded children with conditions that may independently cause toe walking. Data on Achilles lengthening surgeries, sex, race and body mass index was gathered. The toe walking prevalence amongst children with and without autism was calculated. Multivariable logistic regression analysis controlling for sex, race and body mass index was used to determine independent risk factors for persistent toe walking and surgery. Of the children who met inclusion criteria (N = 284,925), 4622 (1.6%) had persistent toe walking. Prevalence of persistent toe walking was higher amongst children with autism (6.3% vs 1.5%, p < .01), as were odds of persistent toe walking (OR 4.13, 95% CI 3.74 to 4.56, p < .01). Males and White patients had higher odds of persistent toe walking compared to females and patients of any other race, respectively (p < .01 for all). Although children with autism and toe walking had higher rates of surgery than their counterparts without autism (4.3% vs 2.6%, p = .04), this difference was not significant after controlling for sex, race and BMI (OR 1.59, 95% CI 0.95 to 2.69, p > .05).

### The British Society for Rheumatology guideline for the management of foot health in inflammatory arthritis [^c6c760b3]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Follow-up and monitoring

(24) In adults, children and young people with confirmed IA, questions relating to foot symptoms should be asked at each visit and, if appropriate, clinical examination of the foot should be undertaken, including disease activity, deformities, foot posture, musculoskeletal function, footwear, gait, range of motion, vascular and neurological status, and skin and nail pathologies. SOR: 1; LOE: B/C; SOA: 92.

Rationale

The rationale for this recommendation is similar to recommendation 1. Patients should be asked about foot symptoms at every appointment, by any member of the MDT, and assessed as indicated.

(25) In young people with IA who transfer from paediatric to adult care, a multidisciplinary approach to foot health should be considered a core element of the transition process. SOR: 2; LOE: C; SOA: 98.

Rationale

There is no direct evidence for the inclusion of foot health in transitional care; the SOR is based on expert opinion. Transitional care is defined as the purposeful, planned process of transferring a young person's healthcare from a child-centred to an adult-orientated care setting that comprehensively addresses the medical, psychosocial, educational and vocational needs of that young person. To enhance the process, young people with IA should be appropriately signposted to information and educational resources relating to foot health and made aware of how to access foot health services, at each visit. EULAR/PReS standards and recommendations for the transitional care of young people with juvenile-onset rheumatic diseases and recent National Confidential Enquiry into Patient Outcome and Death (NCEPOD) recommendations should be considered.

Recommendations for secondary prevention

Physical activity

(26) Adults or children and young people with foot problems in IA should be encouraged and supported to meet physical activity guidelines for people with IA. This may include regular assessment and management of foot health needs, including appropriate footwear. SOR: 1; LOE: C; SOA: 98.

### Physical activity and quality of life in children with idiopathic toe walking: a cross sectional study [^d4d7fea9]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study investigated the physical activity of children with ITW gait against the Australian 24-hour movement guidelines. Participants within this study achieved sufficient physical activity intensity. This contrasted with our hypothesis, given many children with gait disorders are less physically active than their peers, and do not meet physical activity recommendations. Finding physical activity levels in this cohort higher than the minimum recommended levels by the guidelines may provide some insights into the less favourable outcomes of management of children with ITW reported by clinicians and parents. Higher levels of physical activity in children with ITW may prompt dosage consideration of any prescribed treatment. For example, children with ITW may need to practice a prescribed new movement more frequently than other children who move less in order to establish new movement patterns. This may be particularly pertinent in older children with ITW who may have more ingrained movement patterns.

Although the children within this study all met the physical activity guidelines for MVPA, they generally spent greater than the recommended time in front of screens, and the majority did not meet the sleep guidelines. Increased screen time and reduced sleep are risk factors for obesity within children, although prevalence of high BMI was not greater than in the general population for children in this cohort. To our knowledge, sleep variables have not been collected with ITW cohorts before, therefore comparison of this data to similar populations was not possible. Other children who toe walk with diagnoses such as autism, regularly report difficulties with sleep onset, insomnia and sleep disruption. Further research may consider investigating these sleep variables in children with ITW. It is commonly accepted that some children with ITW display different sensory behaviours to children without toe walking gait, and altered sleep patterns as well as reduced sleep may exist. Sleep quality and quantity of children with ITW, particularly where uncomfortable interventions such as serial casting may impact sleep hygiene should be considered as part of treatment planning.

### Physical activity and quality of life in children with idiopathic toe walking: a cross sectional study [^c5746753]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Physical activity intensity and type (including sedentary behaviour) is commonly measured using accelerometery, owing to its convenience and acceptability compared to the criterion standard of indirect calorimetry (oxygen consumption). Accelerometry has been utilised to assess habitual physical activity in children who toe walk from medical conditions such as cerebral palsy and autism. Studies concluded that children who toe walk with these diagnoses were less likely to meet physical activity guidelines compared to typically developing peers. To our knowledge, there are no studies examining the physical activity level of children with an ITW gait using accelerometry outside of the laboratory or clinical setting.

There remains controversy as to whether ITW should be treated, or left to self-resolve. Treatment decisions may be based on many factors such as impairment at the foot or ankle, any pain, or a child's ability to participate, yet the range of these factors are not commonly reported within treatment studies about ITW. Developing a greater understanding of any burden of disease associated with this condition could assist health professionals and family navigate the varied treatment options and help inform treatment timing decisions. This study aimed to explore any burden ITW has by describing if children with an ITW gait meet Australian 24-hour movement guidelines, and identifying any factors associated with moderate to vigorous physical activity time. Our hypothesis was that children with ITW would not meet the Australian guidelines.

### Botulinum toxin A does not improve the results of cast treatment for idiopathic toe-walking: a randomized controlled trial [^fc8eb3d4]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2013). Low credibility.

Background

There are many treatments for idiopathic toe-walking, including casts with or without injection of botulinum toxin A. Combined treatment with casts and botulinum toxin A has become more common even though there have been few studies of its efficacy and safety problems. Our aims were to conduct a randomized controlled trial to test the hypotheses that combined treatment with casts and botulinum toxin A is more effective than casts alone in reducing toe-walking by patients five to fifteen years of age, and that the treatment effect correlates with the extent of coexisting neuropsychiatric problems.

Methods

All patients who had been consecutively admitted to the pediatric orthopaedics department of our institution because of idiopathic toe-walking between November 2005 and April 2010 were considered for inclusion in the study. Forty-seven children constituted the study population. The children were randomized to undergo four weeks of treatment with below-the-knee casts either as the sole intervention or to undergo the cast treatment one to two weeks after receiving injections of botulinum toxin A into the calves. Before treatment and three and twelve months after cast removal, all children underwent three-dimensional (3-D) gait analysis. The severity of the idiopathic toe-walking was classified on the basis of the gait analysis, and the parents rated the time that their child spent on his/her toes during barefoot walking. Passive hip, knee, and ankle motion as well as ankle dorsiflexor strength were measured. Before treatment, all children were evaluated with a screening questionnaire for neuropsychiatric problems.

Results

No differences were found in any outcome parameter between the groups before treatment or at three or twelve months after cast removal. Several gait-analysis parameters, passive ankle motion, and ankle dorsiflexor strength were improved at both three and twelve months in both groups, even though many children still demonstrated some degree of toe-walking. The treatment outcomes were not correlated with coexisting neuropsychiatric problems.

Conclusion

Adding botulinum toxin-A injections prior to cast treatment for idiopathic toe-walking does not improve the outcome of cast-only treatment.

### Childhood nail diseases [^f3138891]. Dermatologic Clinics (2006). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of pediatric nail populations is complicated because a large proportion of pediatric nail presentations involve parents bringing in their children with questions regarding nail appearance rather than the plain presentation of a disease or functional problem. Parents are concerned whether the nails are normal, if they are uncomfortable for the baby or child, if the nails will affect walking or other future function, or if the changes are of wider significance and suggest more sinister medical problems than are yet apparent. To address these concerns, the clinician needs a good grasp of what is normal.

### Attaining a British consensus on managing idiopathic congenital talipes equinovarus up to walking age [^eb77a3e2]. The Bone & Joint Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The Ponseti method is the 'gold standard' for treating congenital talipes equinovarus (CTEV) and is applied worldwide. - Variations in treatment protocols, including age at the beginning of casting, the health professional involved in casting, casting technique, foot abduction brace regime, and follow-up time have led to operation rates of up to 53.3%. On the other hand, the mean reported rate for surgery in Europe is 10.5%, where the Ponseti method is followed without deviation. It has also been shown that patients with CTEV treated with soft-tissue release have poor long-term outcomes, with a correlation between the extent of soft-tissue release and functional impairment. -

The James Lind Alliance priority setting on lower limb surgery in children highlighted variations in practice as one of their top 20 priorities, which, along with geographical variation and lack of good evidence, motivated the British Society of Children's Orthopaedic Surgery (BSCOS) to develop consensus groups, of which primary CTEV management was one.

Previous attempts at developing consensus at a European level included a relatively small number of experts and healthcare professionals. This paper, however, is the first reported consensus of the management of CTEV by all paediatric orthopaedic healthcare practitioners working in the UK.

Consensus methods provide a way of synthesizing information and harnessing the insights of appropriate experts to enable decision-making. The Delphi technique is a structured process that uses a series or 'rounds' of questionnaires to gather information and reach consensus. Since a large number of individuals across diverse locations and areas of expertise can be included anonymously, this method is able to avoid domination of the consensus process by one or a few experts.

The health question covered by the consensus statement is whether the variability of care provision and outcomes in primary CTEV can be reduced by following the same agreed management steps. Setting these standards allows for effective data collection and identification of outliers. Furthermore, it will enable those treating CTEV to share the published consensus document with both carers and patient groups.

The objective of this paper is to provide a statement that could be followed, audited, and benchmarked against the agreed standard of care and presents the final consensus document along with an overview of the process.

### Attaining a British consensus on managing idiopathic congenital talipes equinovarus up to walking age [^7226b75e]. The Bone & Joint Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

The external review for this consensus document is the BSCOS body. The members and associated members who participated in the Delphi survey aimed to improve the quality of the proposed statements, generate feedback, and assess the applicability and feasibility of the suggested statements.

One of the strengths of the study is its vigorous design, meticulous implementation, and interpretation of results. The study protocol was executed as published without changes, and the timeline maintained. The limitation of the methodology includes the participants in the consensus process who were all BSCOS members. This selection is appropriate for a UK consensus statement, but can reflect a bias when attempting to implement the consensus document in other countries. However, we believe that the majority of the consensus document is applicable to most areas worldwide.

It is also acknowledged that there is a larger representation of paediatric orthopaedic consultants than other practitioners in the BSCOS. The steering committee included participants from a wide geographical area, including representatives from numerous units in the UK. The combination of the diversity of steering group members, the high participation rate, and very low dropout of 14% in the Delphi survey contributed to an extensive representation of CTEV practitioners from the UK. The percentage of members who voted (63%, n = 153) possibly reflects the fact that not all members of BSCOS treat clubfeet.

The information regarding barriers to implementing recommendations were sought through feedback from stakeholders during the Delphi process, as well as during the discussions in the steering group meetings. The barriers were identified in two aspects: one access to formal Ponseti training, and the other availability of resources for the clinic set-up that includes two trained practitioners available for every casting, a child-appropriate environment, sufficient level of staff to support communication with parents, regular audits, and training. These barriers did not influence the guideline development process or formation of the recommendations. The barriers were discussed and considered in depth.

The purpose of this consensus process was not necessarily to reflect current management practice, but to explicitly set the benchmark for the best quality of care. It was also felt that by providing the most appropriate standard of care recommendations, it will assist practitioners and managers in understanding the clinic's needs and business planning.

### Attaining a British consensus on managing idiopathic congenital talipes equinovarus up to walking age [^efeed655]. The Bone & Joint Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Results

Formulation of recommendation: steering group meetings

Six steering group meetings were held throughout the process. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, these meetings were all undertaken via remote video connection. Four meetings, each lasting three hours, were held prior to the Delphi survey. A fifth meeting took place between Delphi round 1 and 2 and the final consensus meeting took place following Delphi round 2.

In the first meeting, a chair was elected and the six successive stages of the document were decided upon. Detailed statements under each section were suggested by all members over three meetings. Each suggested topic generated a process including a current literature review, as well as the group members' expert opinion, and the statements to be included in each section were selected. A fourth meeting summarized all agreed statements to be presented to BSCOS members in the round 1 Delphi survey. The fifth meeting took place following Delphi round 1. In this meeting, the items that reached 'consensus in' were read and approved, the items that reached 'no consensus' were discussed, reassessed, and modified, and the final list of statements to be presented in round 2 was agreed upon. The final consensus meeting took place following Delphi round 2. Items that reached 'no consensus' following round 2 were discussed in depth and voted upon to decide whether there was merit in including them. The items to be included in the consensus document were finalized. The meetings timeline followed the consensus protocol.

Round 1 Delphi survey

In total, 61 statements were included in Delphi round 1. Overall, 43 statements reached 'consensus in' and were included in the final statement after approval by the steering group. No statements reached 'consensus out'. 18 statements reached 'no consensus' and were discussed in the steering group meeting. Following this discussion, four statements with scoring close to the low cut-off point were removed. A total of 14 statements were added to round 2, and 11 were rephrased based on the comments received from round 1, while three were added as they were. One new statement was added to round 2 based on the comments received from round 1 and following discussion. The total number of statements presented to round 2 was 15. The statements that were deleted and added following round 1 are presented in Table III.

### Treatment for idiopathic toe-walking: results at skeletal maturity [^eb5b948c]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2003). Low credibility.

Thirteen skeletally mature subjects who had been treated as children for idiopathic toe-walking underwent gait analysis and calf muscle strength testing at an average of 10.8 years from the last intervention. Six had had serial casting only; seven had had either a percutaneous tendo Achilles lengthening or a Baker's gastroc-soleus lengthening. Sagittal plane kinematics at the ankle was altered in 12 of the 13 subjects, but the changes were detectable visually in only 3 subjects. One subject had increased ankle plantarflexion at initial contact, but the other 12 subjects had a normal first rocker. Peak ankle dorsiflexion in stance averaged only 9 degrees, and 11 of the subjects had a peak ankle dorsiflexion in stance greater than 2 standard deviations below normative values. Ankle dorsiflexion was also restricted on passive measures, but there was no correlation between ankle dorsiflexion non-weight-bearing and in gait. Inversion of second rocker was seen in two subjects with peak ankle dorsiflexion in stance occurring before 25% of the gait cycle. Power generation by the calf during a single heel-rise test was variable between subjects but within normative values compared with controls. The authors conclude that most subjects showed persistent changes in ankle kinematics and kinetics despite treatment but that this was not detectable visually in most subjects.

### Controlled ankle movement (CAM) boot provides improved outcomes with lower complications than short leg walking cast in low-energy pediatric lateral ankle injuries: a prospective, randomized study [^83430c41]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Low-energy lateral ankle injuries (Salter-Harris 1 distal fibula, distal fibula avulsion fractures, and radiograph-negative lateral ankle injuries) are common in pediatric patients. Patient-based outcomes for the 2 treatment options, short leg walking cast (CAST) and controlled ankle motion (CAM) boot, are unknown. This study aims to determine differences between 2 treatments of low-energy lateral ankle injuries in pediatric patients.

Methods

A prospective, randomized controlled trial comparing the acute outcomes of CAST and CAM treatment for low-energy lateral ankle injuries in pediatric patients was completed. Patients were evaluated in-person at presentation and 4 weeks for ankle range of motion and Oxford foot and ankle score. A novel survey defining patient and parent satisfaction and time away from school/work was also completed. Treatment complications were documented. Patients were called at 8 weeks postinjury to determine other complications and the final time of return to sport. Mixed effects linear regression models evaluated change over time between the 2 treatment groups.

Results

After 60 patients were enrolled, 28 patients in the CAST group and 27 patients in the CAM group completed the study. Males comprised 51% (28), with 38 (69%) patients identifying as Hispanic. The patient's average age was 11.3 ± 2.9 years and the average body mass index was 23. At the 4-week evaluation, the CAM group had improved range of motion, higher satisfaction scores (5.26 CAM vs. 4.25 CAST, P < 0.05), similar pain scores (0.32 CAST vs. 0.41 CAM, P = 0.75), and lower complications (0.54/patient CAST vs. 0.04/patient CAM, P < 0.0001) than the CAST group. Female patients had improved inversion with CAM treatment than males (P < 0.05). Patients over age 12 in the CAST group had significantly decreased plantarflexion at week 4 (P = 0.002). Improvement in Oxford scores was similar between the CAST and CAM groups between the initial presentation and 4 weeks, except for increased improvement in CAM group Oxford scores for difficulty running and symptoms with walking/walking. At the 8-week evaluation, patients in the CAST group had a higher rate of continued symptoms than the CAM group (15.4% vs. 0%).

Conclusions

CAM boot treatment of low-energy lateral ankle injuries in pediatric patients results in improved results and lower complications than CAST treatment.

### Going toe-to-toe with a rare case of a complex regional pain syndrome limited to the hallux [^b6d17f31]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Treatment

Treatments were administered in accordance with actual knowledge on CRPS and neuropathic pain. Local treatments were chosen preferably because of the small area of clinical manifestations (first topical lidocaine, topical ketamine and finally botulinum toxin injections). In a second step, bisphosphonates (zoledronic acid) and then steroids were also administered. However, none of these attempts resulted in significant therapeutic benefits. Because the patient presented many side effects after oral and systemic treatment, it was decided to avoid other drugs except non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). It was also considered that there was no indication for invasive pain management. In parallel, the patient benefited from physiotherapy (graded exercises, walking school and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation), occupational therapy (desensitisation and motor imagery) and footwear adaptation (adapted orthopaedic shoes and plantar insole). Explanations on the mechanisms of persistent pain and CRPS were given with an interpreter. However, due to the language barrier, low educational attainment and poor health literacy, this approach was limited, as were the opportunities for other therapies, such as cognitive–behavioural therapy. Interdisciplinary care lasted 6 weeks. At this time, the patient was able to walk without a crutch, for a limited travel duration (15–20 minutes), but still avoided the toe-off walking phase. He reported a moderate reduction in pain (20%–30%). It was then decided to continue the follow-up, while spacing out therapy sessions at two times a week intervals.

Objectives of this study

To determine if children with ITW reach Australian 24-hour movement guidelines. Additional objectives were to identify if there are any modifiable (body mass index, screen time, quality of life) or non-modifiable (gender, age) factors that were associated with the MVPA time of children with ITW.

### Health-related quality of life in idiopathic toe walkers: a multicenter prospective cross-sectional study [^25eec74f]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

Despite idiopathic toe walking (ITW) being a significant source of stress and anxiety for children and parents alike, little is known about the effect on health-related quality of life (HRQoL). The primary research question for this study was "Is ITW associated with impaired HRQoL, and is the degree of equinus contracture related to the degree of impairment?"

Methods

Twelve pediatric orthopaedic centers across the United Kingdom participated in this prospective, cross-sectional observational study of children younger than 18 years with ITW. Data were collected between May 2022 and July 2022. Using a standardized, piloted proforma, data collected included: demographics, toe-walking duration, passive ankle range of motion (Silfverskiold test), associated autism spectrum disorder or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, previous and planned treatments, and Oxford Ankle Foot Questionnaire for Children scores. Domain scores were compared with a healthy control group and correlation was made to plantarflexion contracture using standard nonparametric statistical methods.

Results

Data were collected from 157 children. Significant reductions in physical, school and play, and emotional domain scores were noted compared with healthy controls. A significant moderate correlation was noted between passive ankle dorsiflexion and physical domain scores. There were no significant differences in Oxford Ankle Foot Questionnaire for Children scores among patient groups by treatment.

Conclusions

ITW in children is associated with an impairment in HRQoL, not only across the physical domain but also the school and play and emotional domains. The more severe the equinus contracture, the worse the physical domain scores.

### Pediatric rupture of hallux interphalangeal joint lateral collateral ligament [^39afa297]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Surgical Treatment

Initial surgical treatment was done on March 31, 2022, 6 weeks following the tear of the left big toe IP lateral collateral ligament. Under general anesthesia, the patient was positioned in the supine position. A bump was placed under the left hip, a well-padded tourniquet was placed on the left thigh, and the left lower extremity was prepared and draped in the usual fashion. Before the initial incision, the site of injury was marked, and hallux varus and valgus laxity were assessed. Intraoperative laxity was measured under fluoroscopy (Figure 2). The tourniquet was then inflated, and the first incision was made over the lateral aspect of the big toe IP joint area. Following subcutaneous dissection, tears of the lateral collateral ligament and IPJ capsule were identified at the level of the distal aspect of the big toe proximal phalanx. Both the ligament and capsule were intact at the distal phalanx. Evaluation of the ligament indicated good tissue quality; thus, primary repair was planned. In preparing the distal aspect of the proximal phalanx as the insertion site, fibrous tissue was removed with a rongeur, followed by the use of a curet to roughen the bone to allow primary healing of the bone and ligament. The drill for the Minilok DePuy Synthes Mitek suture anchor was used to drill the first hole, after which the first suture anchor was inserted and malleted in. The sutures of the anchor were then attached to the lateral collateral ligament and tied. The ligament was then cinched into its insertion site. A second suture anchor was inserted just dorsal to the first one, after which the more dorsal part of the ligament and capsule were sutured and cinched into the insertion site. Following the application of both suture anchors, joint stability was tested, indicating that the IP joint was stable to a varus stress test. To enhance stability and protect the repair, pinning of the IP joint was done. A single, 0.045-inch, smooth Kirschner wire was inserted from the tip of the distal phalanx just plantar to the nail across the IP joint. The position of the Kirschner wire was confirmed with the C-arm. The wound was irrigated and both subcutaneous tissue and skin layers were sutured closed. Following wound dressing, the patient was fitted with a short leg walking cast that extended beyond the toes. Following the procedure, the patient was discharged home the same day with a controlled ankle motion boot, weight-bearing as tolerated.

### PGALS-paediatric gait arms legs and spine: a simple examination of the musculoskeletal system [^cc1d6909]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Knock knees (genu valgus) are common and are often associated with in-toeing (maximal at approximately 4 years of age) and most resolve by age of 7 years.

Flat feet – most children have a flexible foot with normal arch on tiptoeing and resolve by 6 years.

Crooked toes – most resolve with weight bearing.

Normal variants: indications for referral

- Persistent changes (beyond the expected age ranges)

- Progressive/asymmetrical changes

- Short stature or dysmorphic features

- Painful changes with functional limitation

- Regression or delayed motor milestones

- Abnormal joint examination elsewhere

- Suggestion of neurological disease/developmental delay

Table 1
Normal major motor milestones

Joint abnormalities can be subtle or difficult to appreciate in the young (such as 'chubby' ankles, fingers, wrists and knees). Looking for asymmetrical changes is helpful although can be falsely reassuring in the presence of symmetrical joint involvement. Muscle wasting (such as of the quadriceps or calf muscles) indicates chronicity of joint disease (knee or ankle respectively). Increased symmetrical calf muscle bulk associates with types of muscular dystrophy, and proximal myopathies may be suggested by delayed milestones such as walking (later than 18 months) or inability to jump (in the school-aged child).

Ranges of joint movement should be symmetrical and an appreciation of the 'normal' range of movement in childhood can be gained with increased clinical experience. Hypermobility may be generalised or limited to peripheral joints such as hands and feet, and, generally speaking, younger female children and those of non-Caucasian origin are more flexible. It is important to consider 'non-benign' causes of hypermobility such as Marfan's syndrome (may be suggested by tall habitus with long thin fingers, and high arch palate), and Ehler's Danlos syndromes (may be suggested by easy bruising, skin elasticity with poor healing after minor trauma). Conversely, lack of joint mobility, especially if symmetrical and in a child with short stature, dysmorphism or developmental delay, may suggest storage diseases or skeletal dysplasias. Asymmetrical loss of range is always significant and the absence of normal arches on tiptoe suggests a non-mobile flat foot and warrants investigation (e.g. to exclude tarsal coalition). High fixed arches and persistent toe walking may suggest neurological disease.

### Hammertoes: anatomy, pathophysiology, and comprehensive treatment strategies [^fd34baf0]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2025). Medium credibility.

Hammertoe is a common foot deformity that originates from the proximal interphalangeal joint of the lesser toes. The deformity involves an imbalance between the muscles and tendons that control toe movement, leading to deformity. Hammertoes can result from various factors, including genetic predisposition, ill-fitting footwear, trauma, or underlying medical conditions such as neuromuscular disorders or diabetic neuropathy. As the deformity progresses, patients may experience pain, difficulty walking, and development of corns or calluses on the affected toes. Treatment strategies for hammertoes range from nonsurgical to surgical, depending on the severity of discomfort and effect on patient function. Nonsurgical treatment includes wearing appropriate footwear, using orthotic devices, and performing targeted exercises to strengthen and stretch affected muscles. In more advanced cases, surgical options, such as tendon transfers, joint arthrodesis, or arthroplasty, may be considered. A comprehensive understanding of hammertoe anatomy, pathophysiology, and treatment options is crucial for the effective management of this condition.

### The telemedicine-based pediatric examination of the back and lower limbs: a narrative review [^95632a54]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Motor Examination

Strength testing has been described as one of the largest challenges of the virtual foot and ankle examination. Nevertheless, the clinician can assess for ankle dorsiflexion, plantar flexion, eversion, inversion, and big toe extensor strength by having the patient or caregiver resist the patient's movements while communicating perceived strength. In addition, a patient's ability to walk on their tip toes indicates at least 4/5 strength in plantar flexion, but asymmetries may be difficult to appreciate virtually. Having the patient walk on their heels can assess for dorsiflexion strength while lateral and medial foot walks can assess for ankle inversion and eversion, respectively.

Special Testing

Several studies have adapted special testing of the foot and ankle to virtual consultations., Clinicians can guide the patient to test for pes planus by performing heel raises, and pes cavus by performing the Coleman block test. It is also possible to test for hallux rigidus by assessing the ROM of the big toe and for Achilles rupture by guiding the patient through a Thompson test. If a Morton's neuroma is suspected, the clinician can ask the patient to perform a self-applied metatarsal squeeze and assess for tenderness between the metatarsal heads, pain reproduction or the presence of a clicking sound.

Reliability and Validity

A systematic review identified a study demonstrating criterion validity and reliability in performing a virtual examination of the ankle in adults compared to face-to-face consultations. Out of 15 patients presenting with ankle pain, 14 received either the same (53%) or a similar (40%) pathoanatomical diagnosis from the in-person versus online examiners, with high inter- and intra-rater reliability. Clinical observations of ankle ROM, calcaneofibular ligament stress testing, gait analysis and neurodynamic testing (eg leg squat) were found to have significant agreement between examiners, with high inter- and intra-rater reliability. Additionally, standardized virtual management of acute Achilles' tendon rupture has been shown to be safe and reproducible, with re-rupture rates comparable to those managed in person. Despite not being specific to the pediatric population, the evidence highlighted above can increase providers' confidence when performing a virtual foot and ankle exam.

### Comprehensive outcomes of surgically treated idiopathic toe walkers [^e23230f1]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2006). Low credibility.

The treatment of idiopathic toe walking in children can include surgical lengthening of the gastrocnemius/soleus complex after conservative options have been ineffective. Previous outcome reports of surgery for idiopathic toe walkers have largely been limited to assessing the sagittal plane motion of dorsiflexion/plantar flexion with minimal quantitative preoperative and postoperative analysis. The purpose of this study was to comprehensively assess the outcome of idiopathic toe walkers that had been treated surgically. Fourteen children seen in our motion analysis laboratory that underwent gastrocnemius or tendo-Achilles lengthening for idiopathic toe walking were retrospectively reviewed. Preoperatively, this group had significantly greater anterior pelvic tilt than normal, decreased peak knee flexion in swing, greater external foot progression, and the expected increased plantar flexion (P < 0.01). Postoperatively, anterior pelvic tilt decreased by a mean of about 4 degrees (P < 0.01), only for the group that had tendo-Achilles lengthening because the gastrocnemius group was close to normal preoperatively, and peak knee flexion normalized. The foot progression angle of this group did not change from preoperative values and remained significantly more external than normal, although dorsiflexion in stance significantly improved after surgery (indicating the goal of the surgery was achieved). Increased external foot progression in idiopathic toe walkers is apparently due to increased external tibial torsion and/or external hip rotation but was unaffected by gastrocnemius/soleus surgical lengthening. Significant improvement occurred on an overall index of gait variables, indicating surgery can be an effective treatment of idiopathic toe walkers.

### Patient-reported outcome measurement information system (PROMIS) scores in pediatric idiopathic toe walkers [^8361f8ab]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Idiopathic toe walking (ITW) can result in early contact with the health care system and be distressing for patients and their families. The natural history of ITW is poorly characterized. Deciding how and when to intervene can be difficult. Patient-reported outcomes are utilized in the clinical setting to assess patient factors and indications that may better inform treatment plans. Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) is an instrument designed to collect patient-reported outcomes. Minimum clinically important differences in PROMIS metrics have been established to facilitate clinical relevance and utility of these metrics. The purpose of this study was to characterize the patient perspective of ITW by utilizing the PROMIS scores.

Methods

Retrospective chart review was performed to identify children aged 5 to 17 with a diagnosis of ITW treated at a single tertiary care center between 2017 and 2020. Inclusion criteria were a diagnosis of ITW and completion of a PROMIS questionnaire. Exclusion criteria were neurologic disease, autism, and previous surgical treatment. Demographic, physical exam, treatment, and available motion analysis data were collected. PROMIS scores for the following domains were available: Mobility, Peer Relationships, and Pain Interference.

Results

Forty-five children were enrolled. Seventy-three percent of PROMIS scores were patient reported while the remainder were parent reported. PROMIS score means for the cohort by domain were Mobility: 45.2 ± 8.2 (P < 0.000); Peer Relationships: 46.4 ± 11.6 (P = 0.047); and Pain Interference: 47.4 ± 9.5 (P = 0.67). Motion analysis data, available for 11 children, noted age-matched gait velocity negatively correlated (rs = -0.652, P = 0.03) with Peer Relationships. No correlations were found between other aspects of gait, body mass index, or limitations in dorsiflexion and PROMIS domains. Parents reported lower Mobility scores than children did. There were no other significant differences between patient-reported and parent-reported PROMIS scores. PROMIS scores did not differ significantly between those < 10 years and those ≥ 10 years.

Conclusion

In this cohort of 45 otherwise healthy children without other neurologic diagnoses, there are both clinically and statistically significant differences in PROMIS means between our cohort and the healthy age-matched population. These differences manifested in worse peer relationships and mobility scores.

Frostbite ambulation during evacuation — although it is reasonable to walk on a foot with frostbitten toes for evacuation purposes, it is inadvisable to walk on an entirely frostbitten foot because of the potential for resulting morbidity. If using a frozen extremity for locomotion or evacuation is unavoidable, the extremity should be padded, splinted, and kept as immobile as possible to minimize additional trauma.

Ankle and Foot

Like in the knee exam, patients should be instructed to wear shorts and to be barefoot in preparation for their virtual appointment. The camera should be positioned at the level of the patient's shins when sitting, and on the ground angled towards their feet when standing. A mobile device rather than a desktop can facilitate camera positioning. In the case of traumatic injuries, clinicians can use the Ottawa Ankle Rule over videoconference to determine whether imaging is needed to evaluate for a foot or ankle fracture.

Inspection and Palpation

When observing the ankle and foot, the clinician should look for misalignment, atrophy, deformity, incision, scarring, rash, swelling, ecchymosis and erythema in the frontal, sagittal and posterior planes. The plantar aspect of the foot should not be neglected. Special attention should be paid to the Achilles tendon, plantar fascia, and the possible presence of pes planus, pes cavus and bunions. We recommend that the arches of the feet be examined with and without weight-bearing to differentiate between muscle insufficiency and structural causes. The number of toes visible lateral to each ankle should also be assessed as it is an indicator of over-pronation. Gait assessment includes standard walking, toe walking and heel walking. The caregiver can be asked to position the camera on the ground to get a better view of the feet. In an ambulatory child, the clinician can also assess running, jumping, hopping on one foot or single leg stance. Patients should be asked to point to the area of maximal tenderness which is easily identifiable as many structures causing pathology in this area are located superficially.

Although distal pulses cannot be reliably palpated by the patient or caregiver, circulation can be assessed first by noting any colour incongruencies between both soles of the feet. The clinician can then assess for temperature differences between their feet in response to the patient's touch or ideally, the caregiver's touch. Capillary refill can be tested by asking the patient to press on the big toe until it blanches and allowing it to return to pink while on camera, noting how long this takes.

### Neuropsychiatric symptoms and problems among children with idiopathic toe-walking [^5a4a815b]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Idiopathic toe-walking (ITW) is a condition in which otherwise healthy children walk on their toes. The diagnosis is a diagnosis of exclusion. The aim of this study was to elucidate the occurrence of neuropsychiatric symptoms among 5- to 13-year-old children with ITW.

Methods

Fifty-one consecutive children (31 boys, 20 girls) with a mean age of 9 years and 1 month were referred to a pediatric orthopaedic unit for ITW. Evaluations included assessments by a pediatric orthopaedic surgeon and a pediatric neurologist and the parents were asked to complete the Five to Fifteen questionnaire, a validated screening tool for neuropsychiatric problems. The study cohort was compared with an age-matched normative group previously described.

Results

In the study group, the percentage of children scoring above the 90th percentile, indicating difficulties, were for the different domains; motor skills 39.0%, executive functions 17.6%, perception 25.5%, memory 23.5%, language 23.5%, learning 25.9%, social skills 25.5%, and emotional/behavioural problems 21.6%.

Conclusions

Children with ITW as a group displayed more neuropsychiatric problems than a normative group of age-matched children. These findings merit future larger studies. Furthermore, when children with ITW are referred for orthopaedic or neurological assessment, a structured neuropsychiatric history is advisable and further neuropsychiatric investigations should be considered.

### The diagnosis and treatment of heel pain: a clinical practice guideline-revision 2010 [^57385177]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2010). Medium credibility.

Plantar heel pain second-tier therapy and outcomes — The second tier of the treatment ladder includes continuation of initial options with additional therapies including orthotic devices, night splints to maintain an extended length of the plantar fascia and gastro-soleus complex during sleep, repeat corticosteroid injection or injection of botulinum toxin, a course of physical therapy, and cast immobilization for 4 to 6 weeks or use of a short-leg walking boot to immobilize or offload the foot during activity. In patients with a high body mass index (BMI), a consultation and referral for an appropriate weight-loss program may be considered. Clinical response to this second tier of treatment will usually occur within 2 to 3 months in 85% to 90% of patients; for those who have shown improvement, continuation of tier 1 and tier 2 therapies should be continued until resolution of symptoms, and following a therapeutic regimen as outlined in Pathway 2, 90% to 95% of patients experience resolution of symptoms within 1 year.

### Guideline for care of patients with the diagnoses of craniosynostosis: working group on craniosynostosis [^ab97d917]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Feet

The hands are always more severely affected than the feet. Children with Apert walk at a relatively late age (10–34 months). It is not reported why they are walking at a late age. The big toe may be bifid.

The classification of the foot deformities parallels that of the hand;
Type 1) Digits 2, 3, and 4 are fused. The big toe is short, shortens progressively, and often deviates medially.
Type 2) Digits 2, 3, 4, and 5 are fused.
Type 3) All toes are fused (in most patients).

Progressive fusion of the tarsus and metatarsus is seen making the movement of foot and ankle increasingly difficult over time. The first digit shortens with medial deviation from the big toe, secondary to growth deformities and a delta phalanx. In the toes with 2 phalanges, fusion occurs while retaining minimal movement in the metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joints. The midfoot and hindfoot characteristically fuse in a supination position. The fifth metatarsal is prominent with callus formation under the small head of the fifth and third metatarsal bones.

### Diagnosis and management of Cornelia de Lange syndrome: first international consensus statement [^afdd26da]. Nature Reviews: Genetics (2018). Medium credibility.

In individuals with major anomalies, physical therapy or surgical procedures are usually not indicated as function is often remarkably good (R43). The use of full prosthetic devices has been attempted, but our joint experience indicates it is only rarely successful as the prostheses are not often accepted. The use of specific devices, for example, to allow independent eating, should be considered, as acceptance of such devices can be good (R44, R45). Minor limb anomalies do not require therapeutic interventions.

Major malformations of the lower extremities (absent tibia or fibula and split foot) are extremely uncommon. Minor leg length differences occur in 46% of individuals, and Legg–Calvé–Perthes disease, a hip disorder that presents alongside disrupted blood flow to the femur, is seen in 4%. Congenital hip dislocations are uncommon, and hip dislocations occur in 10% of individuals with CdLS later in life, especially in wheelchair-bound or bed-ridden individuals, as do tight hamstrings and Achilles tendons and contractures. Management is as in the general population, taking the prognosis with respect to development and mobility into account. Preventive measures (physical therapy or orthoses) are paramount, and Botox injections and surgery may be indicated as well. Minor lower limb anomalies (small feet, cutaneous syndactyly between the second and third toes, short fourth metatarsals or inward deviation of the big toes (hallux valgus)) are frequently present. Specifically, deviation of the halluces may increase with age and cause walking difficulties. In adults, 75% of individuals with CdLS report bunions, albeit without major complications; thus, surgical repair is not indicated.

Scoliosis, especially thoracic scoliosis, develops in one-third of patients, often by 10 years of age, and is more common in adults with decreased mobility(R46). Experience of scoliosis surgery is limited, but our mutual experience indicates that standard management is effective, taking prognosis with respect to development and mobility into account. Spine malformations are extremely rare and typically asymptomatic, with kyphosis present in one-quarter of these individuals. Flexion contractures have been reported in 18–25% of individuals with CdLS, particularly in the knees, which can interfere with ambulation, but also in the elbow and/or hip, as have tight Achilles tendons.

### The limping child: a systematic approach to diagnosis [^22c58de2]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Deviations from a normal age-appropriate gait pattern can be caused by a wide variety of conditions. In most children, limping is caused by a mild, self-limiting event, such as a contusion, strain, or sprain. In some cases, however, a limp can be a sign of a serious or even life-threatening condition. Delays in diagnosis and treatment can result in significant morbidity and mortality. Examination of a limping child should begin with a thorough history, focusing on the presence of pain, any history of trauma, and any associated systemic symptoms. The presence of fever, night sweats, weight loss, and anorexia suggests the possibility of infection, inflammation, or malignancy. Physical examination should focus on identifying the type of limp and localizing the site of pathology by direct palpation and by examining the range of motion of individual joints. Localized tenderness may indicate contusions, fractures, osteomyelitis, or malignancy. A palpable mass raises the concern of malignancy. The child should be carefully examined because non-musculoskeletal conditions can cause limping. Based on the most probable diagnoses suggested by the history and physical examination, the appropriate use of laboratory tests and imaging studies can help confirm the diagnosis.

### Diagnosis and treatment of plantar fasciitis [^0fa96690]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Plantar fasciitis, a self-limiting condition, is a common cause of heel pain in adults. It affects more than 1 million persons per year, and two-thirds of patients with plantar fasciitis will seek care from their family physician. Plantar fasciitis affects sedentary and athletic populations. Obesity, excessive foot pronation, excessive running, and prolonged standing are risk factors for developing plantar fasciitis. Diagnosis is primarily based on history and physical examination. Patients may present with heel pain with their first steps in the morning or after prolonged sitting, and sharp pain with palpation of the medial plantar calcaneal region. Discomfort in the proximal plantar fascia can be elicited by passive ankle/first toe dorsiflexion. Diagnostic imaging is rarely needed for the initial diagnosis of plantar fasciitis. Use of ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging is reserved for recalcitrant cases or to rule out other heel pathology; findings of increased plantar fascia thickness and abnormal tissue signal the diagnosis of plantar fasciitis. Conservative treatments help with the disabling pain. Initially, patient-directed treatments consisting of rest, activity modification, ice massage, oral analgesics, and stretching techniques can be tried for several weeks. If heel pain persists, then physician-prescribed treatments such as physical therapy modalities, foot orthotics, night splinting, and corticosteroid injections should be considered. Ninety percent of patients will improve with these conservative techniques. Patients with chronic recalcitrant plantar fasciitis lasting six months or longer can consider extracorporeal shock wave therapy or plantar fasciotomy.

### Physical activity and quality of life in children with idiopathic toe walking: a cross sectional study [^21f549ef]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Pediatric quality of life inventory (PedsQL)

Health related quality of life scores were measured with the age appropriate Parent-Proxy and Child-Self Report PedsQL4.0 Generic Core Scales. These scales consist of 23 questions that encompass physical functioning (8 items), emotional functioning (5 items), social functioning (5 items) and school functioning (5 items) domains. The scale asks how much of a problem each item has been during the past 1 month, with the parent or child scoring on a 3 point or 5 point Likert scale respectively, corresponding to the age group of the scale. For the current study, the scales responding to ages 5–7 years (young child), 8–12 years (child) and 13–18 years (adolescent) scale were used as per age of the child. All questions were the same for each scale, with adjusted developmentally appropriate language and scoring. Scores were reversed and totalled so that a higher score in each domain indicates better HRQoL (Health-Related Quality of Life). The Child-Self and Parent-Proxy Report scales have reported satisfactory validity and reliability.

Procedure

Participants were recruited from private practice clinics, public health outpatient and community clinics, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Potential participants were initially screened against the eligibility criteria by a clinician researcher who had > 8 years working in public health community-based paediatric gait screening clinics. Following parent and participant consent, demographic data, time period in relationship to school term were collected, and HRQoL surveys were completed. Participants were fitted with the ActiGraph on the non-dominant wrist, with a flexible fabric wristband. Participants were instructed to wear the ActiGraph for 24 hours a day for a period of 7 consecutive days (excluding showering, bathing or swimming) to maximise pre-determined valid wear-time decisions during analysis. To minimise wearer bias, valid wear-time was not communicated to participants. Parents were provided with the paper-copy of the CLASS and instructed in its completion at the end of every day for 7 consecutive days.

Medical history

A careful medical history should include the age of onset and accompanying symptoms, which may include bone pain, muscle weakness and pain, fatigue, decreased exercise tolerance, gait disturbance, height loss, increased thoracic kyphosis, pectus carinatum, and fractures. Cases have been reported in individuals as young as 9 months old, with a median age of onset of 46 years and a range of 9 months–90 years. Previous accounts indicated that equal proportions of men and women are affected by TIO; however, more recent evidence from systematic reviews suggests that more men than women are diagnosed. A systematic review of 895 TIO cases reported that, of the 858 cases with information on sex, 58.3% were male and 41.7% were female. Similar results were reported in another recent systematic review. Bone pain in the distal extremities is the most common initial symptom in adults, with ankles and feet being the most often affected. Other frequently reported sites of pain include the upper and lower back and neck, sternum, and shoulders, as well as diffuse/generalized bone pain. Fractures commonly occur in the ribs, vertebral bodies, femoral neck or shaft, and pelvis. In line with this, evidence also suggests that patients with TIO have notably lower bone mineral density and strength compared with not only healthy controls but also patients with X‐linked hypophosphatemia (XLH). In the rare cases in children, there may be delayed motor milestones, lower extremity deformity, failure to ambulate, and other rachitic symptoms (authors' clinical observations).

Medication history should be carefully assessed for iatrogenic causes of hypophosphatemia (Table 1).

Family history

TIO should be suspected in patients with suggestive symptoms and clinical presentation without evidence of personal or family history of hereditary hypophosphatemia. Taking an accurate family history is particularly important in children because genetic causes of hypophosphatemia are much more common than TIO. Ideally, all children and young adults suspected of having TIO should undergo genetic testing to exclude genetic causes of hypophosphatemia. Because the onset of heritable causes can sometimes be subtle, not becoming apparent until adulthood, genetic testing should be strongly considered in adults with chronic hypophosphatemia due to renal phosphate wasting for whom the diagnosis of TIO is being considered, especially when the tumor cannot be identified.

Introduction: Progressive pseudorheumatoid dysplasia (PPD) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by non-inflammatory progressive arthropathy. A genetic defect causes progressive degeneration in joint cartilage (1). Typically starting with symmetric joint swelling and pain in childhood, PPD is often confused with more common pediatric rheumatic diseases such as juvenile idiopathic arthritis due to clinical similarities (2). Radiographic findings typically display characteristic changes like vertebral flattening and peripheral metaphyseal widening, which are important for distinguishing PPD from other conditions. This disease leads to progressive cartilage loss, joint stiffness, joint enlargement, and skeletal abnormalities, without the systemic inflammatory features typical of JIA.

Objectives: Misdiagnosis of PPD can lead to inappropriate treatments. Here, we present two siblings diagnosed with PPD to highlight the need for a genetic approach in cases of arthropathy with atypical courses.

Methods: Case 1 (17-year-old male): The patient first presented at the age of 7–8 with swelling in the fingers, leg deformities, later immobility, and a history of corrective orthopedic surgery. He had previously received treatments for JIA, which had not been beneficial. It was noted that his parents were related. Physical examination revealed bilateral metacarpophalangeal and interphalangeal joint swelling, pronounced kyphosis, deformities in the lower extremities, muscle atrophy, and swelling in both knees and toes, resulting in the inability to walk and reliance on a wheelchair. Despite these findings, he reported no significant pain. The patient's growth metrics were significantly below the standard percentile for his age. Acute phase reactants were normal, and radiographic examinations showed epiphyseal widening in the hand joints. MRI also displayed similar changes, indicating a non-inflammatory polyarticular process. Case 2 (9-year-old male): The younger brother of Case 1 presented with swelling in the fingers, wrists, and knees, and difficulty walking. Despite sharing similar clinical features, he did not have the advanced orthopedic complications seen in his older brother. Family history, radiological, and clinical findings prompted genetic testing of the patients.

High-altitude cerebral edema (HACE) — key diagnostic features and imaging: The diagnosis of HACE is heralded by signs of encephalopathy including ataxia — often the earliest clinical finding — and altered mentation; other signs include apathy, irritability, lassitude, and inability to provide self-care, and untreated HACE can progress to coma. Heel-toe walking can gauge ataxia, papilledema can confirm cerebral edema, and optic nerve sheath diameter by ultrasound is not reliable for diagnosis of AMS or HACE. With HACE, MRI often shows increased FLAIR and T2 signal in the corpus callosum with microhemorrhages consistent with blood-brain barrier disruption, mainly in the corpus callosum, and microhemorrhages can still be seen on MRI up to 120 mo following an episode of HACE, enabling retrospective evaluation after return to sea level.

### Idiopathic toe walking: a kinematic and kinetic profile [^d27a6634]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose

The differential diagnosis in children who walk on their toes includes mild spastic diplegia and idiopathic toe walking (ITW). A diagnosis of ITW is often one of exclusion. To better characterize the diagnosis of ITW, quantitative gait analysis was utilized in a series of patients with an established diagnosis of ITW.

Study Design

Patients with an established diagnosis of ITW were analyzed by quantitative gait analysis. Data were recorded as each subject walked in a self-selected toe-walking pattern. The subject was then asked to ambulate making every effort to walk in a normal heel-toe reciprocating fashion. Data were collected to determine if this group of idiopathic toe walkers was able to normalize their gait. Datasets were compared with each other and with historical normal controls.

Results

Fifty-one neurologically normal children (102 extremities) with ITW were studied in the Motion Analysis Laboratory at a mean age of 9.3 years. In the self-selected trials, significant deviations in both kinematics and kinetics at the level of the ankle were identified. Disruption of all 3 ankle rockers and a plantar flexion bias of the ankle throughout the gait cycle were most commonly seen. When asked to attempt a normal heel-toe gait, 17% of the children were able to normalize both stance and swing variables. In addition, 70% were able to normalize some but not all of the stance and swing variables.

Conclusion

Quantitative gait analysis is an effective tool for differentiating mild cerebral palsy from ITW. Kinematic and kinetic distinctions between the diagnoses are evident at the knee and ankle. The ability to normalize on demand at least some of the kinematic and kinetic variables associated with toe walking is seen in most children with ITW.

### Short stature as a presenting symptom of attenuated mucopolysaccharidosis type I: case report and clinical insights [^e617076f]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

The case study demonstrates that endocrinologists may not consider MPS I in cases of short stature, even when there are signs and symptoms suggestive of MPS I. Red-flag signs and symptoms for attenuated MPS I (Table 1) exist in the absence of parameters indicating juvenile idiopathic arthritis. The case presentation highlights the diagnostic journey of a patient with attenuated MPS I and short stature followed for over 10 years in a pediatric endocrinology clinic. A strength of this case is the duration of care and longitudinal growth data, although in some instances, assessments and clinical management information were unavailable. This patient had many of the signs and symptoms of attenuated MPS I, yet was not diagnosed until nearly 11 years after presenting to the pediatric endocrinologist with short stature. While not all of the signs listed in Table 1 may be apparent at the initial patient presentation to the endocrinologist, they are likely to develop over time when untreated, or be documented in patient clinical records and history. It is important to note that assessment of bone age in children with growth delay is typically done with an X-ray of the left hand and wrist; thus, pediatric endocrinologists are ideally situated to identify early phalangeal abnormalities (i.e. bullet shaped phalanges) typical of MPS I. A path to MPS I diagnosis when indicating signs are present is shown in Fig. 3. There is considerable overlap of presenting symptoms among the MPS disorders, therefore, screening identified in Fig. 3 should take into account other MPS disorders where short stature is common. Upon consideration of an MPS disorder, a urine GAG (uGAG) test (that may include analyses to determine abnormal GAG pattern, such as electrophoresis or tandem mass spectrometry) can determine the presence of lysosomal storage material. Results of the uGAG test as indicated in Fig. 3 can warrant referral to a geneticist or metabolic disease specialist, who can initiate appropriate enzyme and genetic testing to confirm or rule out an MPS diagnosis. Several barriers can exist for appropriate referrals of pediatric patients to metabolic specialists and geneticists, including cost and insurance, wait times, and location and improvements in accessibility for lysosomal storage disease assays may be needed.

### What's new in the management of foot deformities in children with cerebral palsy [^51735cc6]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Foot deformities have been frequently reported in cerebral palsy (CP), and numerous diagnostic modalities and treatment options have recently been developed to achieve a better level of management for children with CP.

Methods

A thorough search of the English literature, published between January 2013 and March 2016, was performed. A summary of the new findings that had not previously described was reported. The review included recent advances regarding clinical and gait evaluation, orthotic management, botulinum toxin A treatment, and surgical correction.

Results

The review summarized new findings reported in 46 articles and abstracts that were published between January 2013 and March 2016. Older articles were included and cited when an original description was mentioned, or when a change or development of some findings was discussed.

Conclusions

Foot deformity forms an essential part of evaluating children with CP. Dramatic advances have been achieved in gait assessment, conservative management, and surgical correction. Promising results have been reported with the goal to reach a higher level of orthopaedic care and optimize the functional potentials for children with CP.

Level Of Evidence

### The prevalence and course of idiopathic toe-walking in 5-year-old children [^4d88c0f4]. Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Children walking on their toes instead of with a typical gait, without evidence of an underlying medical condition, are defined as idiopathic toe-walkers. The prevalence of idiopathic toe-walking is unknown.

Methods

A cross-sectional prevalence study of 5.5-year-old children (n = 1436) living in Blekinge County, Sweden, was performed at the regular 5.5-year visit to the local child welfare center. Children were assessed for a history of toe-walking or whether they still walked on their toes. Additionally, all 5.5-year-old children (n = 35) admitted to the clinic for children with special needs in the county were assessed.

Results

Of the 1436 children in the cohort (750 boys, 686 girls), 30 children (2.1%, 20 boys and 10 girls) still walked on their toes at age 5.5 years and were considered as active toe-walkers. Forty children (2.8%, 22 boys and 18 girls) had previously walked on their toes but had stopped before the 5.5-year visit and were considered as inactive toe-walkers. At age 5.5 years, the total prevalence of toe-walking was 70 (4.9%) of 1436. For children with a neuropsychiatric diagnosis or developmental delay, the total prevalence for active or inactive toe-walking was 7 (41.2%) of 17.

Conclusions

This study establishes the prevalence and- early spontaneous course of idiopathic toe-walking in 5.5-year-old children. At this age, more than half of the children have spontaneously ceased to walk on their toes. The study confirms earlier findings that toe-walking has a high prevalence among children with a cognitive disorder.

### The effects of serial casting on lower limb function for children with cerebral palsy: a systematic review with meta-analysis [^dea1f534]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Results

Literature search and selection

The database search identified 3219 citations, and after removing duplicates, 1921 articles were included for evaluation in this systematic review (see Fig. 1). After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, 25 articles remained. Collectively 414 children undergoing serial casting (mean age: 5.6 years) were included with 476 limbs assessed across all studies. Two of the studies included did not have a study population of children solely with CP. Brouwer et al. and Brouwer et al. included children that had idiopathic toe-walking; however, the pre- and post-casting results of the children with CP were able to be isolated for analysis. Glanzman et al. included 11 participants that did not have CP; however, this was less than 20% of the total number of participants in that study and subsequently still met the inclusion criteria for the present review. Figure 1 illustrates the screening and selection process and final number of studies included as per the PRISMA protocol.

### Clinical practice recommendations for the diagnosis and management of X-linked hypophosphataemia [^ac3f2be7]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2019). High credibility.

Box 9 Recommendations for orthopaedic management in children with XLH

We do not recommend the use of casts or insoles for the management of lower limb deformity in children with X-linked hypophosphataemia (XLH) (grade C, moderate recommendation)
We suggest emphasizing the importance of weight-bearing exercise, maintenance of joint range and maximizing strength and endurance (grade D, weak recommendation)
We do recommend physiotherapy following surgery or in case of decreased range of movement, muscle weakness, fatigue, instability or physical deconditioning (grade D, weak recommendation)
We recommend that elective surgical treatment should be performed only in children in whom medical treatment has been maximized for at least 12 months (grade C, moderate recommendation)
We suggest that surgery should be performed by a surgeon with expertise in metabolic bone diseases (grade B, moderate recommendation)
We suggest that persisting deformity (mechanical axis deviation Zone 2 or greater) despite optimized medical treatment and/or the presence of symptoms interfering with function should be considered for surgical treatment (grade C, weak recommendation)
We recommend that the age of the child should be considered as an important factor in the decision-making process: guided growth techniques depend on the remaining growth potential of the child and must therefore be carried out at least 2–3 years before skeletal maturity (age 14 in girls and age 16 in boys), whereas the complications associated with osteotomy reduce when the surgery is performed later in childhood or after skeletal maturity (grade C, moderate recommendation)
We recommend that emergency surgical treatment such as fracture fixation should occur when necessary (grade B, moderate recommendation)
We suggest that, following surgery, regular clinical and functional assessments should be made, including radiography, at 12 months post-surgery, or earlier if the bone deformity worsens and/or there is clinical concern. Further assessments should follow intermittently until skeletal maturity (grade C, moderate recommendation)

Casts, insoles and physiotherapy

Evidence does not support the use of insoles or casts to improve lower limb deformity associated with XLH. Insoles cannot improve the position of a flat foot if this is distal to a valgus knee. Physiotherapy (in terms of a general strengthening and/or a gait education programme) might be helpful, especially after surgery.

### Casting is effective for recurrence following ponseti treatment of clubfoot [^ef736d5f]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2018). Low credibility.

Materials and Methods

The research ethics board at The Hospital for Sick Children approved this study, and all parents provided informed consent to participate.

Study Population

The study population included a consecutive series of patients with idiopathic clubfoot who were treated at our hospital between January 2004 and December 2012. Patients were identified through orthopaedic clinic lists. Eligible patients were followed for at least 2 years. Eligible patients included those who had received Ponseti treatment at our hospital before the age of 6 months, irrespective of previous treatment elsewhere. Patients were excluded if they had not been treated according to the Ponseti protocol, had treatment at a different hospital, had received surgery (other than Achilles tenotomy), had an incomplete medical record, or had nonidiopathic clubfoot (i.e. a chromosomal or connective tissue-related disorder, myopathy or myotonic dystrophy, amniotic band, or positional clubfoot), a syndromic deformity (e.g. arthrogryposis or cerebral palsy), or an associated neurological disorder.

The recurrent group was a consecutive series of patients with idiopathic clubfoot who had an initial successful correction with Ponseti casting and bracing but subsequently developed a recurrence. As it was not possible to determine the exact time at which a patient developed a recurrence, recurrence was defined as the date when it was determined that the clubfoot required further intervention to restore a satisfactory functional position (alignment and range of motion). We randomly selected a control group of subjects from patients who had not had recurrence prior to December 31, 2014. If patients had been managed with recasting soon after the initial Ponseti treatment because of skin issues or to bridge a small period when a brace was not worn (e.g. because of the wrong size of the boots), they were classified as not having a recurrence. While the ideal comparison group would have been patients treated with an anterior tibial tendon transfer, this was not performed as initial treatment for recurrence at our hospital.

Information gathered included demographic data (sex, age at presentation, age at recurrence, and age at the time of follow-up), laterality of the clubfoot, whether the clubfoot was complex (defined as having a rigid equinus, severe plantar flexion of all metatarsals, a deep crease above the heel, a transverse crease in the sole of the foot, and a short hyperextended first toe), the number of initial casts (including post-tenotomy cast), surgical interventions, and length of follow-up.

### Physical activity and quality of life in children with idiopathic toe walking: a cross sectional study [^bbc5b597]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To determine if children with idiopathic toe walking (ITW) reach Australian 24-hour movement guidelines. Additional objectives were to identify any factors associated with moderate to vigorous physical activity time of children with ITW.

Design

Cross sectional.

Setting

Private practice, public health outpatient, community clinics.

Participants

Children between 4 and 14 years, who toe walked and had no medical conditions known to cause ITW.

Outcome measures

Physical activity intensity, sedentary behaviour and sleep data were collected via an ActiGraph. Physical activity level intensity data were triangulated with the Child Leisure Activities Study Survey (CLASS) to highlight the subjective nature of parent-reported measures. Health related quality of life information was collected using the Parent-Proxy and Child-Self Report Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) 4.0 Generic Core Scale. Regression analyses were used to explore individual factors associated with moderate to vigorous physical activity.

Results

Twenty-seven participants, 17(63%) male, age mean = 6.62 (SD = 2.29) years, provided information on physical activity (CLASS n = 18, ActiGraph n = 22), physical functioning and psychosocial functioning domains on the PedsQL (Parent-Proxy n = 25, Child n = 22). All participants exceeded Australian recommendations for physical activity, 44% (8/18) met recommended screen time amounts, and two (9%) met recommended sleep times. The Child-Self Report PedsQL scale score of social functioning was the only factor associated with an increase in physical activity (Coef = 0.48, 95%CI = 0.09 to 0.87, p = 0.019).

Conclusion

Participants achieved high levels of daily moderate to vigorous physical activity, and this was associated with social functioning. Given current uncertainty regarding benefits and effectiveness of treatment choices for children who have ITW, these findings should encourage clinicians to consider how their treatment recommendations interact with the PA level and sleep of children with ITW. Any treatment choice should also be implemented with consideration of how it may impact social functioning. This study had a small sample size therefore results should be cautiously interpreted and not generalised to all children with ITW.

### Diabetic foot disorders. A clinical practice guideline (2006 revision) [^27dee316]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2007). Medium credibility.

Assessment of the diabetic foot (Pathway 1) — the pedal manifestations of diabetes are well documented and potentially limb-threatening when left untreated, and the evaluation of the diabetic foot involves careful assimilation of the patient's history and physical findings with the results of necessary diagnostic procedures. Screening tools may be valuable in evaluating the patient and determining risk level, early detection of foot pathology, especially in high-risk patients, can lead to earlier intervention and thereby reduce the potential for hospitalization and amputation, and identification of abnormal historical and/or physical findings can therefore improve the prognosis for a favorable outcome through appropriate — and early — referral. A thorough medical and foot history must be obtained from the patient, and all patients with diabetes require a pedal inspection whenever they present to any health care practitioner.
