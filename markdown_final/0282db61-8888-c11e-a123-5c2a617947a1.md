## Question

Elderly bowel and bladder incontinence

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about bowel and bladder incontinence in older adults. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about definitions and epidemiology to frame the problem. Then, I should verify the pathophysiology and why dual incontinence is common. Next, I will review risk factors and special populations, followed by a careful assessment strategy. After that, I need to appraise treatment options by evidence level and tailor them to frailty and goals of care. Finally, I will consider prevention, quality metrics, and research gaps, and close with a practical, staged algorithm that aligns with guidelines and patient-centered care.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entities and their burden. Urinary incontinence is involuntary urine leakage, and fecal incontinence is involuntary loss of solid or liquid stool; both are common in older adults and often coexist, with combined incontinence reported in roughly 10% of community-dwelling women and 6–10% of men, rising to nearly 50% in nursing homes, which underscores the syndromic nature of this problem in late life [^116ETCAs] [^1168upZC]. Hold on, I should verify prevalence ranges: community FI prevalence increases with age from about 2.6% in adults 20–29 to 15.3% in those ≥ 70, and nursing home FI can reach 42–50%, which aligns with contemporary cohorts and guidelines [^112k77EH] [^1168upZC].

> I will now examine the pathophysiology to explain why dual incontinence is frequent. Age-related changes include decreased urethral closure pressure, impaired detrusor contractility, and reduced rectal compliance and sphincter strength; these changes interact with comorbidities and medications to produce mixed mechanisms such as stress, urge, overflow, and functional incontinence, often in the same patient [^116vrCeK] [^1157RhJM]. Wait, let me verify the bladder–bowel connection: shared pelvic floor innervation and cross-sensitization between lower urinary tract and bowel create bidirectional effects, so constipation and rectal distension can worsen urinary urgency/frequency, and bladder dysfunction can impair bowel emptying, explaining frequent coexistence and the need to treat both systems together [^111D4hES] [^113A5Rq1].

> Next, I should review risk factors and special populations. Nonmodifiable risks include advancing age, female sex, and prior obstetric or anorectal trauma; modifiable risks include obesity, smoking, diabetes, diarrhea/constipation, cognitive impairment, mobility limitation, and polypharmacy, particularly anticholinergics and opioids, which can precipitate or worsen incontinence in older adults [^1157RhJM] [^116vrCeK]. Hold on, I should verify neurogenic contributors: stroke, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and spinal cord injury commonly cause dual incontinence via central and peripheral pathways, and stroke rehabilitation guidance emphasizes early assessment and catheter removal to reduce retention and infection risks that perpetuate incontinence [^111fLfZo] [^113izyzj].

> Let me consider the frail elderly specifically. Frailty compounds incontinence through multimorbidity, sarcopenia, and cognitive decline; prevalence of UI can approach 70% in nursing homes, and FI is a leading cause of institutionalization, reflecting both severity and caregiver burden [^1142S6wi] [^115jJmkh]. I should double-check that guidelines frame UI in frail older adults as a geriatric syndrome requiring multimodal, multidisciplinary assessment and management, with explicit attention to function, cognition, and goals of care [^116prLbc] [^115T6o9C].

> Now, I need to ensure a structured assessment. First, screen proactively because underreporting is common; a simple prompt like "Do you have a bladder or bowel leakage problem that bothers you enough to want treatment?" increases appropriate care by about 15% in adults ≥ 75 years [^1121Q34M]. Then, take a focused history of onset, pattern, severity, impact, prior pelvic surgery/childbirth, bowel habits, medications, and cognitive/mobility status; use diaries or validated questionnaires to quantify symptoms and guide therapy [^116Kr9WS] [^113AbZmB]. Next, perform a targeted exam including abdominal, pelvic, and rectal assessment of prolapse, sphincter tone, and sacral reflexes; reserve urodynamics or anorectal manometry for complex or refractory cases after conservative measures fail [^113jNN7D] [^113AbZmB]. But wait, what if there are red flags such as saddle anesthesia, new severe LUTS, or fecal impaction? In that case, I should evaluate urgently for cauda equina or other neurologic emergencies and address reversible contributors like retention or impaction before labeling as incontinence [^1168bD3e] [^112hbzQT].

> I will now appraise treatment options, starting with conservative measures that carry the best risk–benefit in older adults. Behavioral therapies such as pelvic floor muscle training, bladder training, prompted voiding, and bowel habit training reduce leakage and improve quality of life even in frail older adults; a small-group intervention (Mind Over Matter) produced 71% UI improvement and 55% FI improvement at 4 months in women ≥ 50, supporting community delivery models [^113WP783] [^1152xUa8]. Let me verify home-based care: systematic reviews indicate that tailored, in-home conservative programs are feasible and effective for UI in homebound elders, though high-quality FI trials in this setting are lacking, highlighting a research gap [^1158fRXR] [^115WVXvs].

> Next, I should review pharmacologic therapy with caution. For urgency-predominant UI, anticholinergics can reduce episodes but carry anticholinergic burden and cognitive risks in older adults; beta-3 agonists like mirabegron are reasonable alternatives, though blood pressure and drug–drug interactions must be checked, and outcomes appear similar by age in trials [^112rMG9f] [^113tS1a9]. For FI, optimizing stool consistency with fiber, antidiarrheals, or osmotic agents is first-line; biofeedback can improve squeeze pressures and symptoms in motivated patients, and sacral neuromodulation offers benefit in refractory cases with median cure around 39% in systematic reviews, though access and surgical risk vary [^113AbZmB] [^116gMndR]. Hold on, I should verify that guidelines prioritize conservative measures and reserve surgery for selected refractory cases, which they do [^115jJmkh].

> I need to check surgical and device options and their applicability in older adults. For severe, refractory FI, options include sphincteroplasty, sacral neuromodulation, and in select cases colonic diversion; for UI, slings or bulking can be considered in carefully selected older adults, but nursing home residents have higher 30-day complications and 1-year mortality after pelvic surgery, so shared decision-making and perioperative optimization are essential [^115jJmkh] [^114Bx8dL]. Let me reconsider containment: pads, external devices, and catheter strategies are appropriate adjuncts when cure is not achievable, and dignity-protective continence care practices should be embedded to preserve autonomy and comfort [^116aycnn].

> I should confirm that treatment is individualized to frailty, cognition, and goals. In frail or cognitively impaired patients, simplify regimens, emphasize environmental modifications, toileting assistance, and caregiver training; avoid anticholinergics when possible and align interventions with what matters most to the patient, recognizing that improvement rather than cure may be the realistic endpoint [^116prLbc] [^115T6o9C]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied that pharmacotherapy is contraindicated in all older adults; that overstates the evidence — some can safely use beta-3 agonists or carefully selected anticholinergics with monitoring, but the threshold to start and continue should be higher in the frail [^112rMG9f].

> Next, I should review prevention and quality metrics. Primary prevention via weight management, pelvic floor conditioning, constipation prevention, and medication review can mitigate risk; secondary prevention includes early identification and treatment of reversible causes, and tertiary prevention focuses on minimizing complications and maintaining dignity with containment strategies [^114NTaXR] [^116PG45R]. I need to ensure we measure what matters: outcome indicators such as contained social continence, skin integrity, and patient-reported quality of life are being developed to standardize care and enable quality improvement across settings [^116PG45R].

> I will now examine research gaps and future directions. High-quality RCTs in frail, homebound, and nursing home populations are sparse; we need head-to-head comparisons of behavioral versus pharmacologic therapy, studies of combined modalities, and implementation science to scale effective programs like Mind Over Matter into routine care [^116prLbc] [^1152xUa8]. Hold on, I should verify that guidelines also call for better phenotyping and mechanism-targeted therapies; indeed, there is a push toward defining subtypes and aligning treatments to pathophysiology rather than symptoms alone [^1114q96Y].

> Finally, let me synthesize a practical, staged algorithm while keeping verification checkpoints. Start with universal screening and identification of reversible causes; implement conservative measures including pelvic floor therapy, bladder/bowel habit training, and lifestyle modification; escalate to pharmacotherapy for persistent urgency or stool-form optimization for FI; consider procedural options for refractory cases; and integrate containment with dignity-protective care throughout, reassessing goals and function at each step [^116Kr9WS] [^115jJmkh]. I should double-check that this aligns with major guidelines: yes, ACP/AUA/SUFU and ASCRS endorse stepwise, patient-centered care with conservative first-line strategies and selective escalation, which fits the evidence base and the realities of caring for older adults with complex needs [^116Kr9WS] [^115jJmkh].

---

Elderly bowel and bladder incontinence is common and often coexists, driven by age-related physiological changes, comorbidities, and medications [^116vrCeK] [^1157RhJM]. Management should be **multidisciplinary and individualized**, starting with conservative measures such as pelvic floor therapy, behavioral strategies, and medication adjustments, and escalating to surgical or device-based options if needed [^116Kr9WS] [^115jJmkh]. Care must address both symptoms and quality of life, with attention to dignity, caregiver support, and prevention of complications like skin breakdown and infections [^116aycnn] [^116PG45R].

---

## Epidemiology and prevalence

Urinary incontinence (UI) affects approximately 15–30% of community-dwelling older adults, with higher rates in women and in institutionalized settings [^115CdgrY] [^1142S6wi]. Fecal incontinence (FI) affects about 8–15% of older adults, with prevalence rising with age and in nursing homes [^1168upZC] [^112k77EH]. Dual incontinence (UI and FI) is present in about 10% of community-dwelling older adults and up to 50% in nursing home residents, reflecting shared pathophysiology and risk factors [^116ETCAs] [^1168upZC].

---

## Pathophysiology

### Age-related physiological changes

- **Bladder**: Detrusor overactivity, decreased compliance, impaired contractility, and reduced urethral closure pressure contribute to UI [^116vrCeK].
- **Bowel**: Reduced rectal compliance, impaired internal/external sphincter function, and altered colonic transit cause FI [^notfound].
- **Pelvic floor**: Weakened muscles and connective tissues reduce support and control, worsening both UI and FI [^117533rR].

---

### Comorbidities and medications

Common comorbidities — diabetes, stroke, Parkinson's, dementia, and obesity — increase incontinence risk [^1157RhJM] [^116y8ngt]. Medications such as diuretics, anticholinergics, opioids, and calcium channel blockers can worsen incontinence or cause retention with overflow [^116vrCeK] [^115Y3zst].

---

## Risk factors

| **Category** | **Risk factors** |
|-|-|
| Demographic | - Advanced age <br/> - Female sex <br/> - Institutionalization [^1142S6wi] [^1168upZC] |
| Medical | - Diabetes <br/> - Stroke <br/> - Parkinson's <br/> - Dementia <br/> - Obesity <br/> - Constipation <br/> - Diarrhea [^1157RhJM] [^116y8ngt] |
| Lifestyle | - Smoking <br/> - Physical inactivity <br/> - Poor diet [^1157RhJM] |
| Medications | - Diuretics <br/> - Anticholinergics <br/> - Opioids <br/> - Calcium channel blockers [^116vrCeK] [^115Y3zst] |

---

## Clinical evaluation

### Initial assessment

- **History**: Onset, duration, severity, impact, comorbidities, medications, bowel habits, cognitive function [^116Kr9WS] [^114Pa1ti].
- **Physical exam**: Abdominal, pelvic, rectal, and neurologic exams to identify structural and functional abnormalities [^114Pa1ti] [^113jNN7D].
- **Tests**: Urinalysis, bladder scan for retention, stool consistency assessment, and cognitive screening [^114Pa1ti] [^113izyzj].

---

### Advanced evaluation

Reserve urodynamics, anorectal manometry, and endoscopy for complex or refractory cases [^114Pa1ti] [^113AbZmB]. MRI is used when **neurologic or structural disease** is suspected [^114EgYrP].

---

## Management strategies

### Conservative management

- **Behavioral therapy**: Pelvic floor muscle training, bladder training, timed voiding, and bowel habit training [^116Kr9WS] [^113WP783].
- **Lifestyle modifications**: Weight loss, dietary changes, fluid management, and smoking cessation [^notfound].
- **Medication adjustments**: Review and modify medications that exacerbate incontinence [^116Kr9WS] [^116vrCeK].

---

### Pharmacological management

For UI, options include anticholinergics, beta-3 agonists, and topical estrogen in women; use caution due to side effects in older adults [^112rMG9f] [^116Kr9WS]. For FI, treat diarrhea or constipation with loperamide, bile acid binders, or laxatives, and consider **biofeedback** for pelvic floor retraining [^113AbZmB] [^112CddeH].

---

### Surgical and device-based interventions

- **UI**: Sling procedures, artificial urinary sphincter, sacral neuromodulation, and botulinum toxin injections [^116eohrS].
- **FI**: Sacral neuromodulation, anal sphincteroplasty, injectable bulking agents, and colostomy in severe cases [^115jJmkh] [^113AbZmB].

---

## Impact on quality of life

Incontinence causes embarrassment, social isolation, depression, and anxiety, and is associated with increased risk of institutionalization and caregiver burden [^116ETCAs] [^1142S6wi]. It also leads to skin breakdown, infections, and falls, further reducing quality of life [^116PG45R].

---

## Caregiver and family considerations

Caregivers face physical, emotional, and financial burdens; support, education, and respite care are essential [^116ETCAs] [^1158fRXR]. Family involvement in care planning and decision-making improves outcomes and reduces caregiver stress [^notfound].

---

## Preventive strategies

Preventive strategies include **pelvic floor exercises**, weight management, constipation prevention, and medication review [^114NTaXR] [^113A5Rq1]. Early identification and treatment of reversible causes can prevent or delay incontinence [^116Kr9WS].

---

## Current research and future directions

Research priorities include developing **personalized, multidisciplinary care models**, evaluating novel therapies, and addressing knowledge gaps in frail and institutionalized older adults [^116prLbc] [^115T6o9C]. Digital health and telemedicine may improve access and support for older adults and caregivers [^notfound].

---

Elderly bowel and bladder incontinence is a complex, multifactorial condition requiring a **comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach**. Conservative measures are first-line, with pharmacologic and surgical options for refractory cases. Addressing quality of life, caregiver support, and prevention are essential to effective care.

### Guidelines for adult stroke rehabilitation and recovery: a guideline for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^116y8ngt]. Stroke (2016). Medium credibility.

Treatment of bowel and bladder incontinence — Urinary incontinence and fecal incontinence are common after stroke; approximately 40% to 60% of stroke patients have urinary incontinence during their acute admission for stroke, falling to 25% by hospital discharge, and at 1 year, 15% will remain incontinent of urine. Fecal incontinence prevalence is ≈40% acutely but diminishes to 20% by discharge from rehabilitation. Age, cognition, and motor impairments are risk factors for bladder incontinence, and age and functional impairment are risk factors for fecal incontinence on admission for stroke. Impaired awareness of urinary incontinence is correlated with mortality and the need for nursing home care 3 months after stroke. Many patients recover continence after stroke, and because of the associated risks and burden, management of bowel and bladder continence is an essential part of the rehabilitation process. The recommendation to remove indwelling urinary catheters within 24 hours is based on Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance for all hospitalized patients and is not specific to stroke. We were unable to identify any high-quality studies of treatment for fecal incontinence after stroke, and recommendations are based on the general population of adults.

Objectives

To review the various causes of urinary incontinence (UI) in elderly patients and to outline a therapeutic approach to the clinical management of UI.

Data Sources

Online search of MEDLINE and additional references selected from the articles found during the search.

Study Selection

All peer-reviewed articles and review articles listed on MEDLINE published between 1966 and 1999. Key search terms included urinary incontinence, geriatric, aging, pelvic floor rehabilitation, and indwelling catheter.

Data Extraction

Articles with clinical relevance to the geriatric population were selected based on the robustness of the studies and reviews. If applicable, data from studies of healthier or younger populations was extrapolated to the elderly population examined in this review.

Data Synthesis

UI is a common occurrence among older adults treated in rehabilitation settings. The causes of UI in the elderly vary, including transient causes, established pathologic states of the urinary tract, and systemic multifactorial influences. Both behavioral and pharmacologic management strategies can successfully be implemented for UI, even in the frail elderly.

Conclusion

UI can be effectively investigated and treated by rehabilitation practitioners by following a simple, stepwise approach.

2 Education for Bladder and Bowel Continence Health

One of the biggest challenges with regard to education for bladder and bowel continence health is related to the wide variety of populations that require information. There is a need to provide education to the general public to promote health and good bladder and bowel habits, for primary prevention of bladder and bowel conditions but also to encourage help seeking in those with existing problems. For those patients that have been assessed and offered treatment, education regarding specific conditions and their management is required and additional education is often also required for those patients' families and caregivers both professional and nonprofessional. There is also a need for appropriate education for all healthcare professionals with more in‐depth needs for those specializing in bladder and bowel health. Amongst the pediatric populations, there are additional educational needs amongst schools, teachers, and parents. There is also a fundamental need to educate policy makers with regard to the importance of bladder and bowel health to improve services. The Committee which focussed on primary prevention and education at the International Consultation on Incontinence held in 2023 detailed these issues in depth and identified the need for an increased research focus on prevention and education for all including multidisciplinary healthcare professionals, patients, caregivers, and the general public.

Structural barriers can prevent the implementation of SDM, with reportedly at least 10 prerequisites before SDM can become the norm in clinical practice (Table 1).

Table 1
Structural requirements for embedded SDM.

Additional system barriers include time, costs and low availability of decision aids. Provider barriers include the challenges posed by presenting multiple, often vastly different, treatment options to patients and the clinicians' loss of personal autonomy.

Whilst clinicians are largely in support of embedding SDM in practice, there are still challenges to overcome. Decision aids have been shown to increase patient knowledge and decrease decisional conflict by encouraging patients to consider decisions in the context of their values and preferences. By comparison with many other fields of medicine, there have been mixed results in urology. Challenges include ensuring that support materials are comprehensive and provide the relevant information while also representing the best available up‐to‐date evidence. Decision‐making around elective surgery must also endeavor to link medical information with individual experiences and personal criteria, which often change in priority over time. Information alone does not ensure that the patient can competently participate in the decision‐making, especially if the patient is not sure of their role in the interaction, lacks confidence in their communicative abilities, and/or is interacting with a domineering clinician. Some patients have reported that bringing information they have gained from the internet was met with hostility. Methods of information provision also influence encounters with printed information reportedly not empowering patients in the same way as digital resources. The intended audience is critical with most decision aids developed for younger older people (70 years or under) and not specifically tailored for the needs of people with multimorbidity.

Healthcare decisions can be among the most complex decisions that individuals face, with an often bewildering array of options and potential outcomes. Research is needed into SDM tools, such as decision aids and ways to eliminate barriers for all parties involved.

### Development of quality outcome indicators to improve the quality of urinary and faecal continence care [^116PG45R]. International Urogynecology Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Urinary incontinence (UI) is a common, distressing condition for many, particularly in later life. Current estimates suggest that UI affects the lives of an estimated 400 million people worldwide, and is more common in women than men. The prevalence of fecal incontinence (FI) among community dwelling adults in the USA was recently estimated at 8.39%, with FI more common in women with UI. The prevalence of both UI and FI increases with age.

Urinary incontinence has a profound impact on a person's quality of life and social functioning in addition to being associated with adverse health outcomes such as depression, falls and urinary tract infection.

There are many examples of national and international guidelines that offer recommendations for the care of people with both urinary and fecal incontinence. Most guidelines note that conservative therapies that promote self-management with toileting strategies may result in an acceptable outcome from care. There have been few attempts to systematically measure the quality of care provision for incontinence. A national clinical effectiveness project in England and Wales reported the variability of care and that quality care provision was in the hands of committed individuals, rather than a programmatic provision of services. Aside from product guidelines on absorbent aids, there is a marked lack of auditable quality standards for toileting strategies and containment products. With increased attention to value-based healthcare, a suite of outcome measures for overactive bladder has been developed for incorporation into administrative data sets. This project was undertaken to complement continence-related key performance indicators (KPIs) by identifying and defining a set of indicators applicable to people with bladder and bowel problems who manage their care with a combination of toileting and containment with the intent of attaining contained, social continence.

### Medical therapy for the overactive bladder in the elderly [^112Jnwdc]. Age and Ageing (2002). Low credibility.

The overactive bladder is the commonest underlying bladder disorder causing urinary incontinence in elderly people. Management of the condition relies upon a holistic assessment of the problem, lifestyle adjustment, behavioural management and drug therapy. The majority of currently available drugs rely on their anti-muscarinic properties for efficacy. Both behavioural techniques and drug therapy are effective in treatment of the elderly and each modality has a particular role to play in successful treatment and maintenance of this condition.

### Bladder-bowel interactions: Do we understand pelvic organ cross-sensitization? International consultation on incontinence research society (ICI-RS) 2018 [^111D4hES]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2019). Medium credibility.

Aims

Mounting evidence from experimental animal and human studies suggests that cross-sensitization exists between different organs. Lower urinary tract (LUT) and bowel dysfunction commonly overlap, and the role of cross-sensitization between pelvic visceral organs is uncertain.

Methods

At the International Consultation on Incontinence Research Society (ICI-RS) meeting in 2018, a panel of clinicians participated in a discussion on bladder and bowel interactions in the context of pelvic organ cross-sensitization.

Results

Bladder and bowel problems commonly co-occur in adults and children across different disorders, and the mechanism responsible for overlapping dysfunction is uncertain in most instances. At a neuronal level, cross-sensitization occurs as a result of afferent signaling from the LUT and lower bowel through different central and peripheral mechanisms. Studies in animals and humans have demonstrated evidence for cross-organ sensitization following experimental inflammation or distension of the lower bowel, affecting the LUT. Nerve stimulation is an effective treatment for different functional LUT and bowel disorders, and whether this treatment may influence cross-organ sensitization remains uncertain. The role of physiologically dormant C-fibers, the bladder-gut-brain axis, and gut microbiome in cross-sensitization are speculative.

Conclusion

Recommendations for research were made to explore the role of cross-organ sensitization in the pathogenesis of co-occurring LUT and bowel dysfunction in humans.

### Constipation and fecal incontinence in the elderly [^115eYKFP]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Although constipation and fecal incontinence are common symptoms in the elderly, relatively little research has been done to differentiate physiologic changes in rectoanal function resulting from aging and pathologic changes resulting from diseases occurring as patients age. Certain physiologic changes occur in many older patients and may predispose them to the development of constipation or fecal incontinence. These symptoms need the same thoughtful evaluation and management in the elderly as in younger patients. Results of therapy often can be good, leading to alleviation of suffering and the ability to lead a fuller life.

### Fecal incontinence: pathogenesis, diagnosis, and updated treatment strategies [^1175GSZf]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Fecal incontinence (FI) is defined as the involuntary loss or passage of solid or liquid stool in patients. FI is a common and debilitating condition in men and women. The incidence increases with age and also often goes unreported to health care providers. It is crucial that providers ask at-risk patients about possible symptoms. Evaluation and management is tailored to specific symptoms and characteristics of the incontinence. If conservative methods fail to improve symptoms, then other surgical options are considered, such as sacral nerve stimulation and anal sphincter augmentation. This review provides an update on current and future therapies.

### New horizons: urinary incontinence in older people [^114mBUiN]. Age and Ageing (2014). Low credibility.

Urinary incontinence is a common complaint in older people, and is associated with significant impact on the individual, their carers and the wider healthcare system. As the numbers of frail elderly people increase, so will the burden of incontinence. This review examines recent developments in research into the aetiology, physiology, pathology and treatment of urinary incontinence and lower urinary tract symptoms in older people, and explores potential future developments which might reduce or ameliorate both urinary incontinence and its effects on frail older people. These include increasing understanding of the importance of central control of continence, the role of the urothelium as a sensory organ, novel targets for pharmacological treatments and surgical and invasive interventions.

### Multiple sclerosis: prevalence and factors impacting bladder and bowel function in an Australian community cohort [^117WEJ1h]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose

To describe the prevalence and impact of bladder and bowel dysfunction on quality of life (QoL) in persons with multiple sclerosis (pwMS) in an Australian community cohort and to explore the relationships between commonly used continence measures.

Methods

Patients (N = 73) recruited from a tertiary hospital database, interviewed using standardised measures, based on the framework of International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health.

Results

Of 73 participants (mean age 50 yrs, 73% female, 56% progressive MS), two thirds were bothered by urinary frequency whereas half reported urinary incontinence, and 14% bowel incontinence. Urinary problems impacted emotional health (31%), ability to perform household chores (22%) and physical recreation (28%), with detrimental impact on QoL. There was a significant relationship between symptoms, level of urogenital distress (rho = 0.74, p < 0.001) and impact of incontinence (rho = 0.68, p < 0.001). The single item of Urological Association Symptom Index assessing impact of bladder symptoms on QoL correlated significantly with all other bladder scales (rho = 0.60–0.74), making it a potential 'screening tool' to identify patients for further assessment.

Conclusion

Continence issues cause significant disability in pwMS. Improved awareness of currently available treatment options and clinically robust trials are needed to assess outcomes of continence intervention.

### Fecal incontinence in the elderly: FAQ [^113bmbVq]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Fecal incontinence (FI) is a common gastrointestinal (GI) complaint in patients aged 65 years and older. This evidence-based review article discusses the epidemiology, pathophysiology, evaluation, and management of FI in the geriatric population. We emphasize aging-related changes leading to and impacting evaluation and treatment of this symptom while incorporating the core geriatric principles of functional status and management aligned with patient preference and goals of care.

### Fecal incontinence in the elderly patient [^111UnFMX]. The American Journal of Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Fecal incontinence is an underreported problem in the general population; it is especially common in elderly persons (aged ≥ 65 years) residing in the community or in long-term care settings. It affects more women than men during younger years, but this differential narrows with age. Physiological changes such as sphincter muscle and sensory abnormalities in the anorectal region contribute to this problem, as do factors such as dementia, physical disability, and fecal impaction. Treatment with biofeedback is feasible in many elderly patients. Those with advanced dementia or physical disability may benefit from a bowel habit training program. Selected patients may require surgical sphincter repair. Minimally invasive techniques such as radiofrequency energy application offer promising future treatment options. The purpose of this review is to provide current information on fecal incontinence and its management in the elderly.

### Identification and management of urinary incontinence in midlife women [^115jdz4z]. Menopause (2019). Medium credibility.

Urinary incontinence is a common bladder health problem that disproportionately affects women, especially midlife women. In the absence of alarming signs or symptoms, a step-wise evaluation aligned with patient treatment preferences is appropriate. Initial interventions can include simple behavior therapies, lifestyle modifications, and toileting habits. Systemic medication, surgery, and specialty treatment also can be offered.

### Geriatric considerations in the diagnosis and management of overactive bladder [^1145dHRf]. Urology (2002). Low credibility.

Numerous considerations affect the diagnosis and management of overactive bladder (OAB) in older patients, including neurologic and cardiovascular disorders, musculoskeletal conditions, diabetes, and psychiatric disorders. Older patients are commonly prescribed multiple medications, and many medications can contribute to OAB symptoms and/or interact with drug treatment for OAB. In addition to chronic illnesses and related medications, several factors outside the lower urinary tract can play an important part in managing OAB in older patients. These factors include mobility disorders, cognitive impairment, bowel habits, and fluid intake. Moreover, OAB often does not occur in isolation in the geriatric population. Estrogen deficiency and sphincter weakness in women, prostatic enlargement and obstruction in men, and impaired bladder contractility in both sexes are common and can have prominent effects on management. The diagnostic evaluation of geriatric patients with OAB can usually be accomplished with a basic assessment, without more invasive and expensive procedures. Treatment depends on numerous factors, ranging from comorbidities and functional status to transportation, finances, and patient and caregiver preferences. Adverse effects of bladder-relaxant medications can be bothersome and exacerbate existing conditions common in older patients (eg, constipation, glaucoma, gastroesophageal reflux, and dementia). Setting realistic goals for treatment and communicating them clearly to older patients and their caregivers are crucial for patient satisfaction. There are myriad opportunities for research designed to improve the management of OAB in the geriatric population.

### Office management of geriatric urinary incontinence [^115CdgrY]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Urinary incontinence is a common and potentially disabling condition affecting 15% to 30% of those aged 65 years and older. It adversely affects physical health, psychological well-being, and health care costs. Even when it is not curable, proper management of urinary incontinence can lead to improved quality of life for patients and caregivers. Despite its prevalence, many geriatric patients suffering from urinary incontinence are undiagnosed and untreated. Patients often do not report the problem, and health care professionals often do not ask about it. Health care professionals should therefore learn to identify, evaluate, and manage urinary incontinence based upon the available evidence and practice guidelines. Although the evidence base for specific recommendations for the office evaluation and management of geriatric urinary incontinence is limited, a basic evaluation to identify treatable causes of incontinence, referral of appropriate patients for further evaluation, and several noninvasive management strategies can greatly improve these symptoms in many older patients.

### The prevalence of bowel and bladder function during early childhood: a population-based study [^111w6eAV]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2023). Medium credibility.

Bowel and bladder dysfunction are common among children. A recent meta-analysis of population-based studies showed that constipation is prevalent in 10% of children. Fecal incontinence is estimated to occur in 1%–4% of all toilet-trained children. These bowel complaints impair children's quality of life and lead to considerable and increasing health care costs.

Contrary to popular belief, recent studies showed that bowel dysfunction is already prevalent in infants, toddlers, and preschool children. Existing studies, however, do not demonstrate the continuity of bowel function from one age to the next, but divide their samples into age groups. The result is lack of insight into the physiological bowel function during the first years of life and this in turn impairs recognizing bowel dysfunction in infants, toddlers, and young children.

According to current literature 3%–47% of constipated children also suffer from urinary incontinence. The magnitude of coexisting bowel and bladder dysfunction in infants, toddlers, and young children is unclear. This impairs effective diagnosis and treatment of young children presenting with symptoms of either bowel or bladder dysfunction.

Our primary aim was to determine bowel and bladder function according to age in children aged 1 month to 7 years in the general Dutch population. Second, we aimed to identify demographic factors that were associated with the presence of bowel and bladder dysfunction, and their coexistence.

### Neurogenic bowel dysfunction: clinical management recommendations of the neurologic incontinence committee of the fifth international consultation on incontinence 2013 [^116qfnys]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Evidence-based guidelines for the management of neurological disease and lower bowel dysfunction have been produced by the International Consultations on Incontinence (ICI). These are comprehensive guidelines, and were developed to have world-wide relevance.

Aims

To update clinical management of neurogenic bowel dysfunction from the recommendations of the 4th ICI, 2009.

Materials and Methods

A series of evidence reviews and updates were performed by members of the working group. The resulting guidelines were presented at the 2012 meeting of the European Association of Urology for consultation, and modifications applied to deliver evidence based conclusions and recommendations for the scientific report of the 5th edition of the ICI in 2013.

Results

The current review is a synthesis of the conclusions and recommendations, including the algorithms for initial and specialized management of neurogenic bowel dysfunction. The pathophysiology is described in terms of spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis, and Parkinson's disease. Assessment requires detailed history and clinical assessment, general investigations, and specialized testing, if required. Treatment primarily focuses on optimizing stool consistency and regulating bowel evacuation to improve quality of life. Symptom management covers conservative and interventional measures to promote good habits and assist stool evacuation, along with prevention of incontinence. Education is essential to achieving optimal bowel management.

Discussion

The review offers a pragmatic approach to management in the context of complex pathophysiology and varied evidence base.

### Promoting continence in older people [^1142S6wi]. Age and Ageing (2022). Medium credibility.

The prevalence of urinary incontinence (UI) is strongly associated with increasing age. Twenty five percent of women over 80 years of age have clinically significant symptoms in population surveys, but prevalence is as high as 70% in older hospital in-patients and residents of care homes with nursing. UI substantially affects quality of life and well-being, and generates significant economic burden for health and social care. Sadly, UI is considered as taboo by society, leading to isolation, depression and reluctance to seek help. As with all aspects of care of older people, a multi-modal approach to assessment and management is needed. Key to effective management of incontinence is recognition. As a minimum, clinicians should actively ask patients about continence, especially in older adults living with frailty. Careful evaluation and establishment of any underpinning diagnosis and aetiological factors requires comprehensive, multimodal, usually multidisciplinary, assessment. A lack of awareness of the problem and what can be done about it exists in both laypeople and clinicians, this needs correcting. An interdisciplinary approach to research and management must be the way into the future.

### Can incontinence be cured? A systematic review of cure rates [^116ETCAs]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Urinary incontinence (UI) constitutes a major health problem affecting the lives of an estimated 400 million persons worldwide. The prevalence of UI increases with age and is highly prevalent in the elderly and those with cognitive impairment. Fecal incontinence (FI) occurs in up to 6% of those younger than 40 years increasing to 15% in older individuals. Combined FI and UI has been reported in 10% of women and in 6–10% of men living in the community, increasing to almost 50% in nursing home residents. Incontinence is also more prevalent in men and women affected by various neurological illnesses, e.g. multiple sclerosis, spina bifida, Parkinson's disease, and stroke. The World Health Organization has acknowledged incontinence as a set of diseases (International Classification of Diseases ICD-10) and the International Classification of Functionality recognizes the associated extreme disablement. Global demographic trends suggest that the incidence of both UI and FI will rise in the coming years, with a significant health and social burden as well as an increased economic cost for both patients and health service payers.

Incontinence has a profound impact on well-being and quality of life, causing social embarrassment, reduced employment and work productivity, and preventing many people from participating in paid or unpaid activities. Further, it has a negative influence on sexual health. There is also a significant impact on caregivers and, for older people, incontinence significantly increases the likelihood of institutionalization. Incontinence presents a significant health and economic burden comparable with common major diseases such as arthritis and pneumonia.

Various management options are available for UI, many of which are given in combination, including behavioral techniques, pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT), medication, surgery, nerve stimulation, and containment products such as pads and catheters. Treatment for FI includes diet adaptation, medication, biofeedback, PFMT, surgery, sacral or tibial nerve stimulation, and containment products.

### Incontinence in the frail elderly: report from the 4th international consultation on incontinence [^116prLbc]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2010). Low credibility.

Aims

To summarize current knowledge on the etiology, assessment, and management of urinary incontinence (UI) in frail older persons. "Frail" here indicates a person with a clinical phenotype combining impaired physical activity, mobility, muscle strength, cognition, nutrition, and endurance, associated with being homebound or in care institutions and a high risk of intercurrent disease, disability, and death.

Methods

Revision of 3rd ICI report using systematic review covering years 2004–2008.

Results

We focus on the etiologic, management, and treatment implications of the key concept that UI in frail persons constitutes a syndromic model with multiple interacting risk factors, including age-related physiologic changes, comorbidity, and the common pathways between them. We present new findings with evidence summaries based on all previous data, and an evidence-based algorithm for evaluation and management of UI in frail elderly. We also present new evidence and summarize the data on etiology and management of nocturia and urinary retention in frail elderly.

Conclusions

Despite the overwhelming burden of UI among this population, there remains a continuing paucity of new clinical trials in frail elderly, limiting evidence for the effectiveness of the full range of UI therapy. Future research is needed on current UI treatments (especially models of care delivery, and pharmacologic and surgical therapies), novel management approaches, and the etiologic mechanisms and pathways of the syndromic model.

### Anorectal incontinence: a challenge in diagnostic and therapeutic approach [^1133Vbyg]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2013). Low credibility.

Anorectal incontinence is a symptom of a complex multifactorial disorder involving the pelvic floor and anorectum, which is a severe disability and a major social problem. Various causes may affect the anatomical and functional integrity of the pelvic floor and anorectum, leading to the anorectal continence disorder and incontinence. The most common cause of anorectal incontinence is injury of the sphincter muscles following delivery or anorectal surgeries. Although the exact incidence of anorectal incontinence is unknown, various studies suggest that it affects ~2.2–8.3% of adults, with a significant prevalence in the elderly (> 50%). The successful treatment of anorectal incontinence depends on the accurate diagnosis of its cause. This can be achieved by a thorough assessment of patients. The management of incontinent patients involves conservative therapeutic procedures, surgical techniques, and minimally invasive approaches.

### Evidence-based update on treatments of fecal incontinence in women [^111bxzUU]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Fecal incontinence is a highly prevalent and distressing condition that has a negative impact on quality of life. The etiology is often multifactorial, and the evaluation and treatment of this condition can be hindered by a lack of understanding of the mechanisms and currently available treatment options. This article reviews the evidence-based update for the management of fecal incontinence.

### Prevalence and factors related to urinary incontinence in older adults women worldwide: a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies [^1156NPyV]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

### The prevalence of bowel and bladder function during early childhood: a population-based study [^116yHnmb]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2023). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

At the age of 5 years most Dutch children are fully toilet-trained. Nevertheless, fecal incontinence is common even in fully toilet-trained children. Constipation appears to be common as well, with an equally high prevalence in infants, toddlers, and older children. Furthermore, fecal incontinence and constipation frequently coexist and are often accompanied by urinary incontinence, which requires attention. Remarkably, treatment of fecal incontinence and constipation is lacking in most of the affected children. Therefore, awareness is needed of both bowel and bladder dysfunction in infants, toddlers, and young children to prevent these problems from persisting at older ages. This awareness can, for instance, be created during regular developmental check-ups at the child health care center within the first years of life.

### What characteristics predispose to continence in nursing home residents? a population-based cross-sectional study [^116VJZ6Q]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2015). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Continent residents constituted about 25% of NH residents. Double incontinence and urinary incontinence only were prevalent conditions in NHs, while fecal incontinence alone was rarer. FI alone was related to diarrhea, UI alone was related to ADL deficiency, while DI in addition to diarrhea and ADL deficiency was related to cognitive impairment, stroke, constipation, long-term care stay, longer NH residency, and slightly younger residents. With the exception of diarrhea as a cause of FI, it seemed that FI alone, UI alone, and DI had common causes and development.

### Can incontinence be cured? A systematic review of cure rates [^116gMndR]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Incontinence constitutes a major health problem affecting millions of people worldwide. The present study aims to assess cure rates from treating urinary (UI) or fecal incontinence (FI) and the number of people who may remain dependent on containment strategies.

Methods

Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), CINAHL, and PEDro were searched from January 2005 to June 2015. Supplementary searches included conference abstracts and trials registers (2013–2015). Included studies had patients ≥ 18 years with UI or FI, reported treatment cure or success rates, had ≥ 50 patients treated with any intervention recognized in international guideline algorithms, a follow-up ≥ 3 months, and were published from 2005 onwards. Title and abstract screening, full paper screening, data extraction and risk-of-bias assessment were performed independently by two reviewers. Disagreements were resolved through discussion or referral to a third reviewer where necessary. A narrative summary of included studies is presented.

Results

Most evidence was found for UI: Surgical interventions for stress UI showed a median cure rate of 82.3% (interquartile range (IQR), 72–89.5%); people with urgency UI were mostly treated using medications (median cure rate for antimuscarinics = 49%; IQR, 35.6–58%). Pelvic floor muscle training and bulking agents showed lower cure rates for UI. Sacral neuromodulation for FI had a median cure rate of 38.6% (IQR, 35.6–40.6%).

Conclusions

Many individuals were not cured and hence may continue to rely on containment. No studies were found assessing success of containment strategies. There was a lack of data in the disabled and in those with neurological diseases, in the elderly and those with cognitive impairment. Surgical interventions were effective for stress UI. Other interventions for UI and FI showed lower cure rates. Many individuals are likely to be reliant on containment strategies.

### Vaginal pessaries for treatment of pelvic organ prolapse in elderly women [^11172CTs]. Current Opinion in Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Pelvic organ prolapse (POP) is a common clinical condition that is highly prevalent in the geriatric female population. The condition can have substantial negative influence on multiple symptom and quality-of-life parameters. There are various treatment options for POP, including observation, pessary placement, and surgical treatments with either vaginal reconstruction or colpocleisis resulting in vaginal vault closure. This review examines current literature about pessary use for treatment of POP in elderly women.

Recent Findings

Pessary use appears to be successful for many women and is often associated with improvements in various clinical parameters, including decreased sensation of vaginal bulge and enhanced quality of life. Some patients may experience improvements in bladder or bowel symptoms, although a small percentage may develop new urinary incontinence, constipation, or other defecation problems. Complications of pessary use are generally minor and can usually be successfully treated with targeted therapy such as vaginal estrogen supplementation. Continuity of clinical care is important to help maintain clinical success and prevent potential complications.

Summary

Pessaries are a viable conservative form of treatment for POP for many older women. Pessary use can lead to substantial improvements in quality of life and other clinical outcomes in geriatric patients.

### Functional bladder problems in children: pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment [^115bbeqr]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Functional lower urinary tract problems, bladder and bowel problems, or dysfunctional elimination syndrome are all terms that describe the common array of symptoms that include overactive bladder syndrome, voiding postponement, stress incontinence, giggle incontinence, and dysfunctional voiding in children. This article discusses the nomenclature and looks at the pathophysiology of functional bladder disorders from a different perspective than has been the norm in the past. Some standard medical treatments as well as some newer forms of treatment are outlined. Treatment algorithms for urinary frequency and urinary incontinence have been created to help the practitioner manage the patient.

### Guidelines for adult stroke rehabilitation and recovery: a guideline for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^113izyzj]. Stroke (2016). Medium credibility.

Recommendations: Treatment of bowel and bladder incontinence — Assessment of bladder function in acutely hospitalized stroke patients is recommended (Class I, Level B), and a history of urological issues before stroke should be obtained (Class I, Level B). Assessment of urinary retention through bladder scanning or intermittent catheterizations after voiding while recording volumes is recommended for patients with urinary incontinence or retention (Class I, Level B). Assessment of cognitive awareness of need to void or having voided is reasonable (Class IIa, Level B). Removal of the Foley catheter (if any) within 24 hours after admission for acute stroke is recommended (Class I, Level B). It is reasonable to use the following treatment interventions to improve bladder incontinence in stroke patients: prompted voiding and pelvic floor muscle training (after discharge home) (Class IIa, Level B). It may be reasonable to assess prior bowel function in acutely hospitalized stroke patients and include stool consistency, frequency, and timing (before stroke) and bowel care practices before stroke (Class IIb, Level C).

### Small-group, community-member intervention for urinary and bowel incontinence: a randomized controlled trial [^1152xUa8]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the effects of Mind Over Matter: Healthy Bowels, Healthy Bladder, a small-group intervention, on urinary and bowel incontinence symptoms among older women with incontinence.

Methods

In this individually randomized group treatment trial, women aged 50 years and older with urinary, bowel incontinence, or both, were randomly allocated at baseline to participate in Mind Over Matter: Healthy Bowels, Healthy Bladder immediately (treatment group) or after final data collection (waitlist control group). The primary outcome was urinary incontinence (UI) improvement on the Patient Global Impression of Improvement at 4 months. Validated instruments assessed incontinence, self-efficacy, depression, and barriers to care-seeking. Intent-to-treat analyses compared differences between groups. Target sample size, based on an anticipated improvement rate of 45% in treated women vs 11% in the control group, 90% power, type I error of 0.05, with anticipated attrition of 25%, was 110.

Results

Among 121 women randomized (62 treatment group; 59 control group), 116 (95%) completed the 4-month assessment. Most participants were non-Hispanic white (97%), with a mean age of 75 years (SD 9.2, range 51–98); 66% had attended some college. There were no significant between-group differences at baseline. At 4 months, 71% of treated women vs 23% of women in the control group reported improved UI on Patient Global Impression of Improvement (P < .001); 39% vs 5% were much improved (P < .001). Regarding bowel incontinence, 55% of treated women vs 27% of women in the control group improved on Patient Global Impression of Improvement (P < .005), with 35% vs 11% reporting much improvement (P < .005). Treated women improved significantly more than women in the control group on all validated instruments of incontinence severity, quality of life, and self-efficacy. Care-seeking rates were similar between groups.

Conclusion

Participation in a small-group intervention improves symptoms of both urinary and bowel incontinence in older women. Mind Over Matter is a feasible model with potential to bring effective behavioral solutions to the community.

### Urinary incontinence in women [^113x3b4t]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Urinary incontinence (UI) is common among women and contributes to decreased quality of life. Several effective treatment options are available for the most common types of UI (stress, urge, and mixed), including lifestyle and behavioral therapy, drug therapy, and minimally invasive procedures. Most women improve with treatment, and UI is not an inevitable part of aging. To maximize the opportunity for successful treatment, it is critical to align the treatment approach with patient goals and expectations for care, including an assessment of patient-driven priorities regarding potential adverse effects, costs, and expected benefit of different treatment approaches.

### Symptomatic and restorative therapies in neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders [^113xswNa]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Bowel dysfunction is as common as bladder dysfunction in NMOSD affecting nearly 78% of patients. It usually manifests with constipation and less frequently with fecal incontinence. No specific studies have been conducted for NMOSD-related bowel dysfunction but the common practice is to start with dietary fibers, laxatives, stimulants, and stool softeners. Severe or complex bowel dysfunction including fecal incontinence may respond to SNM or PTNS. In refractory cases, a colostomy may be necessary.

Sexual dysfunction is very common in NMOSD affecting about 43% of sexually active females and 75% of sexually active males according to one study. No specific treatments for sexual dysfunction in NMOSD have been formally tested but phosphodiesterase inhibitors (e.g. sildenafil) may be of benefit in treating erectile dysfunction in males and sexual arousal disorder in females if not contraindicated for cardiac or vascular reasons.

### Current and emerging treatment options for fecal incontinence [^112k77EH]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Fecal incontinence (FI), defined as the involuntary loss of rectal contents (eg, liquid or solid stool or gas), is caused by disruptions in the interplay of components that help maintain fecal control. Loss of voluntary control of defecation imposes a considerable social and economic burden: patients report a severely impaired quality of life, and economic costs have been estimated at an average of $4110 per patient annually (2010 US dollars).

Community-based US prevalence data suggest that FI affects an estimated 8.3% of the population, or approximately 20 million adults. According to a US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, FI affects ∼8.4% of noninstitutionalized adults. It is likely that FI is underestimated in the clinic because of several barriers, including misconceptions that FI is a natural part of aging, patient embarrassment, and social stigma.FI prevalence increases with age and regardless of ethnicity, from 2.6% in people aged 20 to 29 years to 15.3% in people aged 70 years or older.FI has been identified in at least 30% of residents in nursing homes, and is a common reason for nursing home admissions in the elderly. Elderly individuals with bowel problems impose a large burden on health care resources, a burden that will likely increase as the population ages.

Several risk factors for FI have been identified, and include obstetric trauma, anal trauma or surgery,–pelvic radiotherapy for cancer,–smoking, obesity, diabetes, and certain neurological conditions. There is a greater prevalence among females than males, which is attributed to maternal injuries sustained during childbirth; however, other factors may play a role in late-onset FI, such as menopause, changes in the pelvic floor due to aging, and pudendal neuropathy.–

FI is clinically subcategorized into 3 different types: (1) passive incontinence [loss of stool without the urge to defecate, mainly attributable to internal anal sphincter (IAS) dysfunction and peripheral neuropathy]; (2) urge incontinence [inability to postpone defecation urge, related mainly to external anal sphincter (EAS) dysfunction]; and (3) fecal seepage (involuntary loss of small amounts of stool), incomplete evacuation, and impaired rectal sensation).

### The prevalence of bowel and bladder function during early childhood: a population-based study [^115V9Sr5]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives:

Our primary aim was to determine bowel and bladder function in children aged 1 month to 7 years in the general Dutch population. Second, we aimed to identify demographic factors associated with the presence of bowel and bladder dysfunction, and their coexistence.

Methods:

For this cross-sectional, population-based study, parents/caregivers of children aged from 1 month to 7 years were asked to complete the Early Pediatric Groningen Defecation and Fecal Continence questionnaire. Different parameters of bowel and bladder function were assessed using validated scoring systems such as the Rome IV criteria.

Results:

The mean age of the study population (N = 791) was 3.9 ± 2.2 years. The mean age at which parents/caregivers considered their child fully toilet-trained was 5.1 ± 1.5 years. Prevalence of fecal incontinence among toilet-trained children was 12%. Overall prevalence of constipation was 14%, with a constant probability and severity at all ages. We found significant associations between fecal incontinence and constipation [odds ratio (OR) = 3.88, 95% CI: 2.06–7.30], fecal incontinence and urinary incontinence (OR = 5.26, 95% CI: 2.78–9.98), and constipation and urinary incontinence (OR = 2.06, 95% CI: 1.24–3.42).

Conclusions:

Even though most children are fully toilet-trained at 5 years, fecal incontinence is common. Constipation appears to be common in infants, toddlers, and older children. Fecal incontinence and constipation frequently coexist and are often accompanied by urinary incontinence. Increased awareness of bowel and bladder dysfunction in infants, toddlers, and young children is required to prevent these problems from continuing at older ages.

### Effectiveness of non-pharmacological interventions delivered at home for urinary and faecal incontinence with homebound older people: systematic review of randomised controlled trials [^1158fRXR]. Age and Ageing (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Problems with continence, which manifest as different subtypes of urinary and/or faecal incontinence, are distressing yet common conditions that increase in prevalence with ageing and impact on both individuals and those living with them. Incontinence is often poorly assessed, diagnosed and managed, with older adults least likely to be offered evidence-based treatments. Incontinence is more prevalent among people with multiple co-morbidities, including obesity, depression, mobility impairment and dementia, and is associated with loneliness and social isolation, poor quality of life, caregiver stresses and moving into care.

Frequently under-reported due to embarrassment, seeing continence problems as normal ageing and being unaware of treatment possibilities, many people struggle to cope at home without seeking help. Prevalence estimates vary across different populations and settings, with urinary incontinence (UI) consistently more commonly reported than faecal, affecting not only the frailest but also fitter community-living older people. As the older age groups, and particularly the 'oldest old', are now the fastest-growing section of the population, and not only in the developed world, the prevalence of incontinence is rising and understanding the needs of the older people affected is a global issue. Pharmacological solutions can play a helpful role in managing some types of incontinence, for instance, prostate problems, nocturia or over-active bladder. However, given the risks of polypharmacy in older people, particularly for the oldest and frailest who are most likely to be housebound, and the uncertainty about the long-term side-effects of anti-cholinergic medications, alternative approaches to supporting continence in this population are necessary.

Evidence suggests that incontinence is remediable for many people using simple lifestyle and behavioural approaches. To date, the bulk of research on incontinence in older people has focused on people in hospital or in care homes settings, where prevalence is more easily estimated than in community settings, and intervention effects are more readily quantified in a more clearly defined target group. Yet only 2.3% of people aged 65 years and older live in care homes (even among those aged ≥ 85 years, this proportion is only 10.2%), and acute hospital stays are usually so short that any meaningful intervention requires continuation into community settings after discharge home.

Group interventions delivered in clinic settings for people living with incontinence have been reported; however, these often have relatively high attrition rates. Reasons include the severity of incontinence, inconvenient location or time and dislike of groups. Stigma associated with services for incontinence may also be a factor.

### Incontinence during and following hospitalisation: a prospective study of prevalence, incidence and association with clinical outcomes [^114h2zmH]. Age and Ageing (2023). Medium credibility.

Key Points

Incontinence is very common in hospitalised older adults and may vary in complex ways through the peri-hospital period.
Hospital-acquired incontinence affects 10.4 to 16.1% of older medical and surgical inpatients.
Almost half of hospitalised older adults experience incontinence before, during or early following hospitalisation.
Health professionals caring for older people need to recognise and respond to continence needs throughout care transitions.

### Incontinence in frail elderly persons: report of the 6th international consultation on incontinence [^115T6o9C]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Evidence-based guidelines for the management of frail older persons with urinary incontinence are rare. Those produced by the International Consultation on Incontinence represent an authoritative set of recommendations spanning all aspects of management.

Aims

To summarize the available evidence relating to the management of urinary incontinence in frail older people published since the 5th International Consultation on Incontinence.

Materials and Methods

A series of systematic reviews and evidence updates were performed by members of the working group to update the 2012 recommendations.

Results

Along with the revision of the treatment algorithm and accompanying text, there have been significant advances in several areas of the management of lower urinary tract symptoms in frail older people.

Discussion

The committee continues to note the relative paucity of data concerning frail older persons and draw attention to knowledge gaps and research opportunities. Clinicians treating older people with lower urinary tract symptoms should use the available evidence from studies of older people combined with careful extrapolation of those data from younger subjects. Due consideration to an individual's frailty and wishes is crucial.

### Management of fecal incontinence in adults [^112CddeH]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2010). Low credibility.

This article summarises the findings from the Conservative Management of Faecal Incontinence in Adults Committee of the International Consultation on Incontinence. We conducted comprehensive literature searches using the following keywords combined with the relevant intervention: "anal, anorectal, bowel, faecal, fecal, rectal, stool" and "continent$ or incontinent$", Prevalence etimates for faecal or anal incontinence vary widely, from 2.2% to 2.5%. Expert opinion supports the use of general health education, patient teaching about bowel function and advice on lifestyle modification, but the evidence base is small. Unlike urinary incontinence, few "lifestyle" associations have been identified with FI and little is known about whether interventions designed to reduce potential risk factors might improve FI. The article summarises the evidence and recommendations from the committee for clinical practice and future research.

### Can incontinence be cured? A systematic review of cure rates [^1167kPc1]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

It is important to guide health service payers and providers as to how continence care might best be configured to deliver efficient, guideline-compliant, high-quality patient care. It has previously been suggested that the provision of continence management be considered for four patient profiles, namely those with (1) UI, (2) FI, (3) disabled/neurological illnesses, or (4) the elderly/cognitively impaired.

Given the impact of incontinence, it is important to know how large the residual problem is following treatment. Although there are numerous systematic reviews of the relative effects of various treatments, there is no review which addresses cure rates following treatment. The aim of this systematic review was to establish cure rates based on extent of leakage after treating incontinence for each of the four pre-defined patient profiles and to assess the number of people still dependent on containment (including behavioral strategies and containment products) following treatment in order to live a normal life.

### Can we improve our routine urological assessment to exclude neurogenic causes for lower urinary tract dysfunction? ICI-RS 2024 [^111fLfZo]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Medium credibility.

These conditions are predisposed to affect characteristic parts of the nervous system, as set out in Table 1.

TABLE 1
Neurological levels affected by disorders that may present initially to a LUTS or urodynamics clinic.

In LUTS clinics, the imperative is to identify additional atypical features. This could include new onset severe LUTS (excluding infection or malignancy). Alternatively, unusual aspects should be noted, such as emergence of enuresis without chronic retention, which might be a result of a cerebral problem. Furthermore, there may be "suspicious" symptoms reported during history taking, such as numbness, weakness, speech disturbance, gait disturbance, memory loss/cognitive impairment, and autonomic symptoms.

Any such concerns mean that consideration should be given to a more extensive assessment for bowel and sexual dysfunction, as these may develop alongside LUTD in the neurogenic context and a "full house" of pelvic organ involvement may be suggestive of a neurological disorder affecting their common pathways. Despite the risk that pelvic organ problems might indicate an occult neurology, they are often not suspected by healthcare professionals seeing these patients. This is highlighted by the omission of pelvic organ problems for recognition and diagnosis of a range of neurological conditions in recent NICE guidance, notably in conditions where pelvic organ symptoms are well established early indications of diseases such as MS and MSA. As pelvic organ problems are common in the general population, it is even more important to distinguish those whose symptoms are being caused by neurological disease, to enable an appropriate and timely referral to an appropriate service (e.g. neurology, neurosurgery or spinal surgery) to reduce the preventable progression of disease, which impacts both the nervous system and the end organs.

Key guidelines instruct the holistic management of bladder, bowel and sexual problems in people with neurological conditions, given that multiple pelvic organ problems are frequently experienced by a single individual. While both healthcare professionals and patients might feel reluctant to discuss sexual problems, their evaluation is important for appreciating any neurological contribution and the impact sexual dysfunction has on the patient and their partner.

Screening tools may be used to identify people who have increased likelihood of particular conditions. The currently available tools assessing pelvic organ function are either single‐system specific or population specific. Commonly they quantify symptom severity and impact, rather than serving to identify the potential cause of the symptoms i.e. neurological.

### The prevalence of bowel and bladder function during early childhood: a population-based study [^115iywJE]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Our primary aim was to determine bowel and bladder function in children aged 1 month to 7 years in the general Dutch population. Second, we aimed to identify demographic factors associated with the presence of bowel and bladder dysfunction, and their coexistence.

Methods

For this cross-sectional, population-based study, parents/caregivers of children aged from 1 month to 7 years were asked to complete the Early Pediatric Groningen Defecation and Fecal Continence questionnaire. Different parameters of bowel and bladder function were assessed using validated scoring systems such as the Rome IV criteria.

Results

The mean age of the study population (N = 791) was 3.9 ± 2.2 years. The mean age at which parents/caregivers considered their child fully toilet-trained was 5.1 ± 1.5 years. Prevalence of fecal incontinence among toilet-trained children was 12%. Overall prevalence of constipation was 14%, with a constant probability and severity at all ages. We found significant associations between fecal incontinence and constipation [odds ratio (OR) = 3.88, 95% CI: 2.06–7.30], fecal incontinence and urinary incontinence (OR = 5.26, 95% CI: 2.78–9.98), and constipation and urinary incontinence (OR = 2.06, 95% CI: 1.24–3.42).

Conclusions

Even though most children are fully toilet-trained at 5 years, fecal incontinence is common. Constipation appears to be common in infants, toddlers, and older children. Fecal incontinence and constipation frequently coexist and are often accompanied by urinary incontinence. Increased awareness of bowel and bladder dysfunction in infants, toddlers, and young children is required to prevent these problems from continuing at older ages.

### Surgical interventions and the use of device-aided therapy for the treatment of fecal incontinence and defecatory disorders [^114XZKDk]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2017). Medium credibility.

Fecal incontinence — definition, prevalence, impact, and screening — states that fecal incontinence (FI) is the recurrent uncontrolled passage of liquid or solid stool and affects 7% to 15% of community-dwelling women and men, with a devastating impact on daily life. Because many patients may not disclose symptoms, physicians routinely should screen patients who may be at risk for symptoms of FI. After diagnosis, management is guided by the severity of FI, its impact on quality of life, and the risk factors for FI.

### Nonsurgical management of urinary incontinence in women: a clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians [^116Kr9WS]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

High-value care and clinical considerations — UI is a common and important health care problem in women that is underreported and underdiagnosed, and clinicians should take a detailed history and ask specific questions about UI, such as the time of onset, symptoms, and frequency. Clinicians should use nonpharmacologic management for UI, such as PFMT for stress UI, bladder training for urgency UI, and PFMT with bladder training for mixed UI, because they are effective, have few adverse effects, and are cheaper than pharmacologic therapies. Although pharmacologic therapy can improve UI and produce complete continence, many patients discontinue medication because of adverse effects. Vulnerable populations include women aged > 65 y, nursing home residents, and women receiving Medicare home care services, and at least one half of women with UI do not report the issue to their physician. Pharmacologic treatment should be based on harms, because most drugs are similarly efficacious. Identifying and managing conditions that may cause UI, such as urinary tract infections; metabolic disorder; excess fluid intake; and impaired mental conditions, such as delirium, are important, and clinicians should identify whether patients are receiving medications that may cause or worsen UI.

### Recent advances in the treatment of urinary incontinence in older women [^116ZPkQg]. Current Opinion in Urology (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Urinary incontinence is a socially disabling condition with a negative impact on quality of life, which will become an increasingly important condition as our population ages. The majority of sufferers are women who are likely to suffer with other long-term medical illnesses which limit their lifestyle.

Recent Findings

There continues to be a dearth of data regarding the evidence-based assessment and management of both urinary incontinence and its associated conditions. This group comprises those who do not receive active treatment for their problem.

Summary

This review examines some of the current trends in management and some interventions for older people which address the problems in a wider sense. An approach for older people is required which is more holistic and inclusive in nature.

### Nonsurgical management of urinary incontinence in women: a clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians [^1121Q34M]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

American College of Physicians guideline — diagnosis of urinary incontinence in women states that physicians should proactively ask female patients about bothersome urinary incontinence (UI) symptoms as part of a routine review of systems, clinicians should take a focused history and ask specific questions about time of onset, symptoms, and frequency, and clinicians should also do a focused physical examination and evaluate neurologic symptoms. An example prompt is, "Do you have a problem with urinary incontinence (or your bladder) that is bothersome enough that you would like to know more about how it could be treated?", and this quality improvement intervention has been shown to increase appropriate care by 15% in patients aged 75 years or older.

### Incontinence after brain injury: prevalence, outcome and multidisciplinary management on a neurological rehabilitation unit [^117JDiCr]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the prevalence, outcome and multidisciplinary management of incontinence in patients with acquired brain injury.

Design

Retrospective case notes review.

Setting

Regional neurological rehabilitation unit.

Subjects

Two hundred and thirty-eight patients with acquired brain injury.

Main Measures

Bladder and bowel subscores of the Barthel Index and Functional Independence Measure; number of multidisciplinary goals addressing bladder and bowel function.

Results

Fifty per cent of patients (n = 112) had impaired bladder or bowel subscores on admission. Significant improvement was seen at discharge but 36% of patients (n = 77) still had some degree of impairment. Over 90% of patients were set multidisciplinary goals addressing self-care (n = 213) and mobility (n = 205) but only 3.5% (n = 8) were set multidisciplinary goals addressing bladder and bowel function.

Conclusions

Incontinence was common in patients with brain injury on a neurological rehabilitation unit. Significant improvement was seen following rehabilitation. Bladder and bowel management was not well incorporated into the multidisciplinary management process.

### Prevalence and correlates of fecal incontinence among nursing home residents: a population-based cross-sectional study [^112Z8PFD]. BMC Geriatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusions

This study has provided a thorough investigation of fecal incontinence related to sex, age, length and type of stay in nursing home, bowel symptoms, medical conditions and ADL functioning. We found that prevalence of fecal incontinence among nursing home residents was 42.3% and this study confirms that fecal incontinence is a common condition among nursing home residents. Despite the increase in age and frailty in nursing home residents over the past decades, we found no major change in prevalence of fecal incontinence in this population compared to previous studies. We found a significant association between diarrhea, nursing home stay between 4–5 years, urinary incontinence, dementia, reduction in ADL-functioning and fecal incontinence. In a resident group with likely deteriorating health and obvious needs, there still remain unmet needs to prolong and maintain such an important function as continent emptying of the bowels.

Overall, the findings of this study have the potential to contribute directly to the improvement of clinical practice in nursing homes. This is because fecal incontinence is a highly prevalent condition in nursing homes worldwide and therefore new knowledge is of interest for all multidisciplinary staff working with elderly residents in nursing homes. For caregivers, fecal incontinence may be seen as a normal condition linked to the aging process and frailty, but being able to maintain bowel continence is a question of dignity for the resident in the late stages of life. This is a complex phenomenon which requires in depth knowledge and understanding regarding causes and consequences for the resident. Making an individual multifactorial assessment of the residents is necessary regarding bowel assessment and assessment of mental and physical capacity. Consequently, individual treatment and care planning are needed to meet this multifaceted problem. More research on how to promote and prolong bowel continence among frail elderly residents is required.

### Urinary incontinence in older women: a syndrome-based approach to addressing late life heterogeneity [^113AEK19]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Urinary incontinence is a prevalent pelvic floor disorder among women of all ages. However, in many older women, especially those who have multiple chronic conditions it may be a geriatric syndrome because of its shared characteristics of physical function impairments, cognitive decline, and mobility disability. The geriatric incontinence syndrome may represent a poorly characterized phenotype of UI among older women which in many ways reflects unhealthy aging. In this article, we explore the evidence behind these concepts together with potentiel impact on the diagnosis and management of UI in this group.

### What characteristics predispose to continence in nursing home residents? a population-based cross-sectional study [^11639uoY]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2015). Low credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Incontinence is a prevalent condition among nursing home (NH) residents. Incontinence causes hygienic problems, skin problems, and leads to impairment in activities of daily living (ADL). It also has implications for resident dignity, as well as being a professional challenge for the caregivers involved. A nursing home is a place of residence for people with health problems and significant deficiencies in ADL.NH residents are "frail elderly with impaired physical activity, mobility, muscle strength, balance, motor processing, cognition, nutrition, and endurance".–After NH admission deterioration in health and ability to self-care will often continue.

Urinary incontinence (UI) is defined as "the complaint of any involuntary leakage of urine". Fecal incontinence (FI) is "the involuntary loss of liquid or solid stool that is a social or hygienic problem". Double incontinence (DI) refers to both conditions being present in the same resident. Previous studies of incontinence among NH residents have identified several risk factors and predictors: UI and FI in frail elderly are related to cognitive and physical decline, diabetes mellitus, depression, constipation, stroke, and non-white race. In addition, UI is related to Parkinson's disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hip problems, congestive heart failure/extremity oedema, lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), urinary tract infection (UTI)and malnutrition.FI is related to diarrheaand length of stay in NH. In addition, incontinence is often double, with both UI and FI in the same patient, and these conditions are often interrelated. Although incontinence is a common condition in NHs, there is also a sizable group of continent residents. There are few studies focused specifically on continent residents, but Chiangidentified 27% continent residents in NHs in an American retrospective chart study. Studying the group of continent residents will arguably enhance our understanding of incontinence. NH residents may have UI, FI, DI, or no incontinence. While some residents do not leak at all, others may experience severe leakage of one kind of incontinence or both. Thus, we chose an approach where incontinence in NHs was viewed both as the dichotomous variables of incontinent and continent, and as a continuous variable (severity) between continent and incontinent. Our aim was to compare characteristics of both incontinent and continent residents in NHs and to explore what predicts continence and severity of incontinence.

### Sacral nerve stimulation for the treatment of refractory voiding and bowel dysfunction [^1169gCLQ]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2014). Low credibility.

Sacral nerve stimulation, sometimes referred to as a "pacemaker for the bladder and bowels" delivers nonpainful, electrical pulses to the sacral nerves to improve or restore function. A relatively simple procedure works via a complex mechanism to modulate the reflexes that influence the bladder, bowels, sphincters, and pelvic floor. Current approved indications include urinary urge incontinence, urgency-frequency, nonobstructive urinary retention, and fecal incontinence. The history, mechanism of action, evolution, and landmark literature for this treatment modality are reviewed.

### The AUA / SUFU guideline on the diagnosis and treatment of idiopathic overactive bladder [^114Pa1ti]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

Medical history and bladder symptom assessment — clinician assessment of patients with symptoms suggestive of OAB should characterize symptoms, assess severity and duration, exclude alternative diagnoses, and identify complicated signs or symptoms that may necessitate referral or additional evaluation. Bladder symptom assessment should include questions about typical OAB symptoms (urinary urgency, daytime and nighttime frequency, urgency urinary incontinence [UUI]), other urinary storage impairments (stress incontinence, incontinence without sensation), and the ability to empty the bladder (straining to void, poor force of stream, urinary hesitancy, history of urinary retention, sensation of incomplete emptying). Predominant emptying symptoms can indicate an elevated post-void residual (PVR) and/or bladder outflow obstruction (BOO), especially in patients with prostates. Certain signs or symptoms may suggest a more complicated process that may require further evaluation include abdominal pain, pelvic pain, hematuria, recurrent UTI, sudden onset of severe OAB symptoms, concomitant neurologic symptoms (blurred vision, limb weakness or numbness), and bowel dysfunction (fecal incontinence, severe constipation). The presence of incomplete emptying or other complicated symptoms warrants specialist evaluation.

### Fecal impaction: a systematic review of its medical complications [^112hbzQT]. BMC Geriatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Faecaloma and intestinal lumen

FI is a rare cause of colon obstruction. However, this represents the second group in terms of frequency among the reviewed complications. From a pathophysiological point of view, lumen obstruction causes colonic pressure increase with the aforementioned complications development. Prompt identification may avoid ischemic phenomena, perforation, and increased secretion, which would cause the so-called "paradoxical or overflow diarrhoea". Partial obstruction is considered if obstruction is not total and must not be confused with the term Intestinal pseudo-obstruction, in which colon dilation is idiopathic. Intestinal obstruction contraindicates treatment with oral solution, and its early identification therefore changes the patient's treatment and prognosis. Differential diagnosis must be done with colonic volvulus, which represents he third cause of colonic obstruction, typical in chronic constipation and elderly people; clinical manifestations present with the triad of constipation, progressive abdominal distension, and severe abdominal pain.

Faecaloma and adjacent structures

The impacted faeces mass effect may cause compression on adjacent structures. The link between faecal impaction and urinary system has been the most widely investigated one so far. Highly distended rectum pressure on the bladder or the urethra has been the main reported mechanism to explain urinary retention in patients with FI. Urinary incontinence, more common than retention in geriatric age, may be due to urgency, overflow, hyperactivity of the detrusor or to bladder irritation. FI- dystocia association has been mainly reported in patients with underlying psychiatric disease. It also appears to be secondary to FI mass effect, although the mechanism in this group has not been investigated due to its low frequency.

Faecal impaction and risk groups

The elderly and neuropsychiatric patients remain the main principal risk groups for faecal impaction development. However, the adult age group (15–65 years old) has been the most frequently reported. It may be explained by a publication bias, most exceptional cases are reported instead of more frequent ones in clinical practise. Neuropsychiatric disease has been the most frequently published comorbidity and chronic constipation was more frequent among this group. Colonic motility and rectal sensitivity impair, combined with the lack of mobility may be factors that contribute to its development. Anticholinergic and antiserotoninergic drugs effects could also be a relevant factor. Patients, principal caretakers and healthcare workers lack of knowledge may encourage the perpetuation of the problem and the development of FI complications.

Complications do not follow a specific or predictable pattern when are more than one in a same case, although available data have been taken from published cases and conclusions should not be drawn in this regard.

### Can we improve our routine urological assessment to exclude neurogenic causes for lower urinary tract dysfunction? ICI-RS 2024 [^113jNN7D]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Medium credibility.

1.2 LUTS Clinic Assessments Preceding Referral to Neurology

In the neurological assessment, control of micturition is not as well characterized as other aspects of spinal cord function and the cranial nerves. A comprehensive history should focus not only on LUTS, but should also assess bowel and sexual functions. The state of the rectum significantly influences the sensations of bladder filling. Neurogenic LUTD and bowel dysfunction, overlap substantially, and may alter congruently over time. Available data on neurological patients suggest that neurogenic bowel dysfunction with chronic constipation may mechanically contribute to LUTD. Chronic constipation and stool impaction may develop over many years, and affected people are often subjectively unaware. The physical examination is crucial for patients with suspected or confirmed NLUTD. Testing is necessary for all urogenital sensations and reflexes. Moreover, comprehensive testing of the pelvic floor and anal sphincter must be carried out. Depicting discrete regions of sensory impairment facilitates a more precise localization of the neurological lesion.

Pelvic examination is mandatory in patients reporting LUTS. In addition to the general pelvic examination, the assessment of sacral reflexes and pelvic sensations can suggest a neurological mechanism, though the sensitivity and specificity of the neuro‐urological examination is unknown. No normative data exist on sacral sensations as age, hormonal status, and menopause can impact sensations on the genitalia. However, the absence of touch or prick sensations, or an asymmetry between sides, should be considered as abnormal. Sacral reflexes include bulbocavernosus and anal, and the absence of both reflexes is suspicious for neurological dysfunction. However, 20% of healthy women do not have bulbocavernosus reflexes. Moreover, the impact of conditions such as fecal impaction or bladder fullness on the facility to elicit these reflexes is unknown.

Assessing the voluntary pelvic floor contraction is part of the physical examination, but inability to contract the pelvic floor muscles is common in women, regardless of neurological status. A reduced anal tone can imply various mechanisms, including peripheral neurological dysfunction. The value of increased anal tone is unknown, especially in young people or in a context of anxiety. A limitation is the inter‐examiner agreement of the assessment of anal tone with the DRESS score, which is poor to moderate, especially in beginner examiners. Overall, the physical examination can support or go against a primary neurological hypothesis, but it is not primarily diagnostic.

### Management of fecal incontinence [^113AbZmB]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

Nine percent of adult women experience episodes of fecal incontinence at least monthly. Fecal incontinence is more common in older women and those with chronic bowel disturbance, diabetes, obesity, prior anal sphincter injury, or urinary incontinence. Fecal incontinence negatively affects quality of life and mental health and is associated with increased risk of nursing home placement. Fewer than 30% of women with fecal incontinence seek care, and lack of information about effective solutions is an important barrier for both patients and health care professionals. Even among women with both urinary and fecal incontinence presenting for urogynecologic care, the rate of verbal disclosure of fecal incontinence symptoms remains low. This article provides an overview of the evaluation and management of fecal incontinence for the busy obstetrician-gynecologist, incorporating existing guidance from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American College of Gastroenterology, and the American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons. The initial clinical evaluation of fecal incontinence requires a focused history and physical examination. Recording patient symptoms using a standard diary or questionnaire can help document symptoms and response to treatment. Invasive diagnostic testing and imaging generally are not needed to initiate treatment but may be considered in complex cases. Most women have mild symptoms that will improve with optimized stool consistency and medications. Additional treatment options include pelvic floor muscle strengthening with or without biofeedback, devices placed anally or vaginally, and surgery, including sacral neurostimulation, anal sphincteroplasty, and, for severely affected individuals for whom other interventions fail, colonic diversion.

### ACOG guidelines on urinary incontinence in women… [^114a8Rb7]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

Urinary incontinence affects up to 70 percent of community-dwelling women and up to 50 percent of nursing home residents. Prevalence increases gradually during young adulthood, peaks broadly around middle age, then steadily increases in the elderly. In up to 75 percent of ambulatory women with incontinence, urodynamic stress incontinence is the main condition. Most women with incontinence do not seek medical help. Common causes of urinary incontinence include urinary tract infections; urethritis; atrophic urethritis or vaginitis; pregnancy; increased urine production from hyperglycemia, hypercalcemia, excess fluid intake, or volume overload; delirium; restricted mobility; stool impaction; and psychologic causes. The differential diagnosis includes filling and storage disorders; fistulas; congenital conditions such as ectopic ureters and epispadias; and neurologic, cognitive, psychologic, physical, pharmacologic, and metabolic conditions.

Some conditions that cause or contribute to urinary incontinence are potentially reversible. Combining drug and behavioral therapy in a stepped program can produce added benefit for patients with urge incontinence. However, there is not enough evidence to show whether drug therapy is better than bladder training or as useful as a supplement. Obesity may be an independent risk factor for the development of incontinence, with obese women having a 4. 2-fold greater risk of stress urinary incontinence than women with normal body mass indices. However, few published studies have addressed the effects of weight loss on incontinence, and those that have addressed this issue only examined the effects of massive weight loss in morbidly obese women. Retropubic colposuspension procedures are indicated for women with urodynamic stress incontinence and a hypermobile proximal urethra and bladder neck.

Selection of a retropubic approach depends on factors such as the need for laparotomy for other pelvic disease, the amount of pelvic organ prolapse, the age and health status of the patient, and whether a vaginal or abdominal procedure will be used to suspend the vagina. One consensus panel review indicated that after 48 months, retropubic suspensions and sling procedures may be more effective than transvaginal needle suspension procedures or anterior colporrhaphy. Retropubic suspensions and sling procedures are associated with slightly higher complication rates, including longer convalescence and postoperative voiding dysfunction.

### Can incontinence be cured? A systematic review of cure rates [^115HvKQ3]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Methods

Objectives

The objectives of this review were to describe cure rates of treatment in patients with UI or FI and estimate how many people remained dependent on containment strategies. A further objective was to determine the extent to which containment strategies facilitated individuals leading a normal life. Pre-specified subgroups were:
UI: Defined as involuntary loss of urine according to International Continence Society/International Urogynecological Association terminology. This profile included people experiencing stress (SUI), urgency (UUI), and mixed (MUI) UI not covered by the other categories.
FI: Defined as loss of control of liquid or solid stool.
Disabled persons and those with neurological problems or diseases: Conditions including Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, multiple system atrophy, stroke, and spina bifida.
Elderly or cognitively impaired: Defined as those ≥ 65 years and those with, among other conditions, Alzheimer's disease.

Cure was defined as no leakage (UI) and/or no episodes of FI at trial specified time points, of at least 3 months. Success rates for containment were defined as the percentage of patients with no limitations to activities of daily living, quality of life, or social interaction.

Data sources and searches

Inclusion criteria

Studies of any design which included adult patients (≥ 18 years) with UI or FI, reporting cure or success rates, with ≥ 50 patients, evaluating any intervention in line with the 5th International Consultation on Incontinence (ICI) treatment algorithms (which includes primary, secondary and additional lines of therapy), a follow-up time ≥ 3 months, and published between January 2005 and June 2015 were included. Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), CINAHL, and PEDro were searched. Supplementary searches were undertaken for conference abstracts and trials registers published in 2014 and 2015 (Additional file 1).

Study selection

Titles and abstracts of retrieved references were screened for relevance independently by two reviewers. Disagreements were resolved through discussion or referral to a third reviewer where necessary. References requiring further scrutiny were ordered and full papers were screened for relevance independently by two reviewers. Disagreements were resolved as for titles/abstracts.

### The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons clinical practice guidelines for the management of fecal incontinence [^1157RhJM]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2023). High credibility.

Fecal incontinence — risk factors and multifactorial causes: Maintaining continence depends on the complex interplay of multiple factors, including anal sphincter and pelvic floor musculature, rectal reservoir function (eg, capacity and compliance), stool consistency, and neurologic function (eg, colonic transit and motility, mental cognition, and sensorimotor function). Although conditions that alter these factors may result in FI, the cause of FI may be multifactorial, and the relative contribution of each factor may be difficult to ascertain. Independent risk factors for FI identified in population-based studies include older age, smoking, obesity, limited physical activity, white race, neurologic disease, diabetes mellitus, frequent and loose stools, and having multiple chronic comorbidities. FI is more prevalent among those with Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, celiac disease, irritable bowel syndrome, or concomitant constipation.

Discussion and Recommendations

After a day of topical presentations and discussions, the entire group discussed the most important research recommendations emerging from the Roundtable. A summary of the discussion specific to each area follows. The specific recommendations are listed in Table 3.

As a whole, the experts agreed that given the demonstrated effectiveness of incontinence treatment, research is needed on methods of increasing healthcare-seeking behavior for women with incontinence as well as implementation of successful prevention and treatment strategies that extend the reach of and optimize individual adherence to effective continence promotion programs. However, while many effective treatments are available, there exists a fundamental lack of understanding of pathophysiology underlying LUT dysfunction, resulting in nontargeted therapies. Physicians are only able to treat symptoms, but cannot correct pathophysiological causes. This shortcoming is combined with the generalized grouping of patients according to symptoms rather than disease mechanisms and results in relatively poor management and ineffective treatment.

Discussions concluded that it is important to understand normal function along with dysfunction to identify the root cause of a problem with the ultimate goal of preventing disease. Knowledge gaps in research have resulted from inadequate phenotype definitions of urinary dysfunction, insufficient data to determine what is normal and abnormal, and animal models that do not appropriately reflect human disease. Specific research recommendations address these limitations, including the need for clinicians to better define disease states so that animal models that more accurately reflect these human conditions and their etiology can be developed.

There is a need for better understanding of molecular, cellular, microbiome, and physiological mechanisms of normal and abnormal function and improved understanding of the role of biological sex in urological function. Additional work is needed to develop animal models that discriminate between different disease etiologies (in incontinence, for example) to properly assess the efficacy and safety of newly developed treatments. Last, a precise understanding of etiologic mechanisms can inform how to develop preventative treatment strategies in the future.

In our cohort, the prevalence of bladder dysfunction was 85%, which is higher than that expected in an unselected MS population, confirming our hypothesis and suggesting common pathophysiology of bowel and bladder dysfunction. Also, the NBD score was strongly correlated with the EDSS, which is a clinical indicator of spinal cord involvement in MS. These findings suggest that gut dysfunction in patients with MS is secondary to spinal cord involvement of the disease.

In patients with primary progressive disease, there was an inverse relationship with bowel symptoms (i.e. the higher the EDSS the lower the level of symptoms). The lower level of disability of this subgroup might explain this; however, it might just indicate that patients with other MS types have more bowel symptoms.

Patient-reported frequency and severity of bowel and bladder symptoms were correlated.

With regards to bowel symptoms evaluation, simple questioning of patient-reported frequency and severity of bowel symptoms is as accurate as a validated questionnaire. Therefore, physicians, in the clinical setting, would be able to assess the impact of bowel dysfunction by determining the percent of time these symptoms are perceived. In contrast, the NBD score could be used to improve the quality of bowel studies in patients with MS.

The main strength of this study is the methodology used to evaluate our hypothesis, which is supported by anatomical considerations and supportive evidence. Also low level of disability in this cohort reduced the effect of confounders such as reduced mobility and polypharmacy.

There are also several limitations. A relevant one is the lack of a control group without bowel symptoms. Unfortunately, although bowel symptoms are so prevalent, it is very difficult to recruit such a reference population in a study.

It is well known that antimuscarinic drugs used for urological symptoms can cause constipation, and this could be a confounding factor affecting our findings. Still, in the study by Chia et al. where patients were receiving pharmacological treatment for bladder dysfunction, no higher occurrence of bowel symptoms was observed.

Unfortunately we did not record drugs taken at the time. But antimuscarinics could have hypothetically masked symptoms of faecal incontinence, ultimately making patients overall more constipated. Still, patients with higher disability had high scores in both constipation and incontinence, suggesting that the confounder effect of drugs, if present, was minimal. In some of our male patients, the presence of undetected prostate hypertrophy might have also contributed to the presence of bladder symptoms.

### Can we prevent incontinence? ICI-RS 2011 [^114NTaXR]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2012). Low credibility.

Aims

A review of the current state of research with regard to prevention of incontinence.

Methods

The search was limited to English language publications on the topic of incontinence prevention.

Results

Incontinence is associated with a range of risk factors, most of which are modifiable. Lifestyle changes with behavioral modifications that can prevent urinary incontinence (UI) need to be adopted from an early phase of life. Pregnancy per se for the woman, independent of labor and delivery practice, is a risk factor for UI. The influence of estrogen is still under discussion as to its direct influence to UI. For both men and women, there is a correlation between pelvic-floor related surgery and UI and fecal incontinence (FI). With further improvement in surgical techniques, UI is often only a transient symptom for most patients. Psychological illnesses and their treatment can induce or worsen incontinence and therefore should be evaluated especially with other necessary co-medications.

Conclusions

The evidence would suggest that in some cases incontinence can be prevented. Although the evidence base for UI is greater than that for FI, the conditions share many similarities with respect to risk and treatment, suggesting that similar benefits may derive from population-based prevention strategies. With primary prevention, actions taken early, even in the absence of incontinence, may avoid or delay its onset. There is also evidence that some risk factors for incontinence are modifiable, although not type specific, and can be reduced through preventive measures.

### What characteristics predispose to continence in nursing home residents? a population-based cross-sectional study [^111VmrAE]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2015). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

NH populations are heterogeneous. In this study, the residents were frail elderly with high age, several diagnoses, and impaired ADL. Incontinence was prevalent in this population, and also associated with a number of medical conditions. Our study had a large sample size, high response rate, and it is reasonable to assume that the results from this study are representative for frail elders in NHs in western countries.

Of the residents included in our study, 25.4% were continent. This corresponds well with the 27% reported in an American study with a similar design. Continent residents were characterized by being in short-term care, shorter stays in NH, less cognitive and physical impairment, less Parkinson's disease and stroke, as well as less constipation and diarrhea. Further, continent residents were more independent in ADL activities. Hence, the characteristics of continent residents were different from the cognitively and physically impaired incontinent residents in our study. However, these results were not unexpected. Being a resident in a NH is usually characterized by frailty, ADL dependency, high co-morbidity, and cognitive impairment. Still, some residents seemed to be less impaired. Who are these residents without somatic and cognitive impairment? The answer lies perhaps in age. Age is no reason for NH admission, but frailty and comorbidity is. Hence, NH residents are a selected group. However, considerable age may outweigh other criteria for NH admission, due to an assumption that high age implicates frailty. The frailest residents will pass away, leaving a persistent group of very old men and women in the NH, a group of survivors. Despite very high age, deteriorating health, institutionalization and changes in life, they maintain their bodily and cognitive functions, including continence. Research is needed to establish more knowledge about this group of residents and how to maintain continence.

### The prevalence of bowel and bladder function during early childhood: a population-based study [^114Ktf5F]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2023). Medium credibility.

Our results demonstrated that fecal incontinence coexisted with constipation in one-third of the children up to 7 years of age. This was comparable to the 25% coexistence of fecal incontinence and constipation in children aged 8–17 years, but much more than the 15% coexistence in adolescents and 4% coexistence in adults. This emphasizes the importance of gaining information about obstructive complaints when young children present with fecal incontinence and vice versa. Nevertheless, the majority of the fecally incontinent children suffered from nonretentive fecal incontinence. The proportion of nonretentive fecal incontinence in the current study was higher than previously described, which most likely was a reflection of the younger age of our study population.

Urinary incontinence was present in no fewer than 40% of the children we studied, which was much higher than the prevalence reported in studies including older children. This corresponds with the steeply decreasing probability of urinary incontinence in older children. A further decline in urinary incontinence with ageing is found in older children, although others did not find this relation.

On account of our finding that urinary incontinence frequently coexisted with both constipation and fecal incontinence, even more than previously found in older children, it is important to inquire about lower urinary tract symptoms in young children who present with bowel dysfunction. Further problems may be prevented by timely and adequate diagnosis, as treatment of constipation and/or fecal incontinence often leads to the resolution of urinary incontinence.

Similar to previous reports in young children, we did not find a sex predominance for fecal incontinence or constipation. It has been suggested that the frequently reported higher prevalence of functional gastrointestinal disorders in women is related to sex hormones, which are not yet present in "adult concentrations" in young children. The fact that we did not find an association between preterm birth and bowel or bladder dysfunction corroborates with previous findings. Also in line with previous reports, we found no association between excessive bodyweight and constipation. Although a higher prevalence of obesity in constipated children of older ages had been described. Likewise, there was no association between underweight and constipation, which had previously been described. The number of children with underweight in the respective study sample was limited.

### Diagnosis and management of urinary incontinence and functional fecal incontinence (encopresis) in children [^116MYiL7]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

The ability to maintain normal continence for urine and stools is not achievable in all children by a certain age. Gaining control of urinary and fecal continence is a complex process, and not all steps and factors involved are fully understood. While normal development of anatomy and physiology are prerequisites to becoming fully continent, anatomic abnormalities, such as bladder exstrophy, epispadias, ectopic ureters, and neurogenic disturbances that can usually be recognized at birth and cause incontinence, will require specialist treatment, not only to restore continence but also to preserve renal function. Most forms of urinary incontinence are not caused by an anatomic or physiologic abnormality and, hence, are more difficult to diagnose and their management requires a sound knowledge of bladder and bowel function.

### Urinary incontinence in women: a review [^116vrCeK]. JAMA (2017). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on urinary incontinence in women:

- **Definition**: UI is defined as involuntary or abnormal leakage of urine.
- **Pathophysiology**: UI has multiple possible causes, including age-related functional changes (overactive detrusor, impaired bladder contractility, decreased pressure in urethra closure, atrophy of urethral areas, prostatic hypertrophy), lesions in the CNS, excess urine output, restricted mobility, stool impaction, UTI, delirium, and medications (α-adrenergic agonists, α-adrenergic antagonists, anticholinergics, cancer drugs, calcium-channel blockers, diuretics, opiates, sedatives).
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of any symptom UI is high in the adult population, with an estimated age-standardized prevalence of 51.1% in women and 13.9%, in men respectively.
- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations include urine leakage and, depending on the etiology, associated LUTS of urgency, frequency, nocturia, weak urination, and incomplete emptying associated.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: UI is a predictor of death in the general population and geriatric population. UI is associated with psychological morbidity and may lead to substantial impairment of QoL.

### European Association of Urology guidelines on male urinary incontinence [^116eohrS]. European Urology (2022). Medium credibility.

Context

Urinary incontinence (UI) is a common condition in elderly men causing a severe worsening of quality of life, and a significant cost for both patients and health systems.

Objective

To report a practical, evidence-based, guideline on definitions, pathophysiology, diagnostic workup, and treatment options for men with different forms of UI.

Evidence Acquisition

A comprehensive literature search, limited to studies representing high levels of evidence and published in the English language, was performed. Databases searched included Medline, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Libraries. A level of evidence and a grade of recommendation were assigned.

Evidence Synthesis

UI can be classified into stress urinary incontinence (SUI), urge urinary incontinence (UUI), and mixed urinary incontinence. A detailed description of the pathophysiology and diagnostic workup has been reported. Simple clinical interventions, behavioural and physical modifications, and pharmacological treatments comprise the initial management for all kinds of UI. Surgery for SUI includes bulking agents, male sling, and compression devices. Surgery for UUI includes bladder wall injection of botulinum toxin A, sacral nerve stimulation, and cystoplasty/urinary diversion.

Conclusions

This 2022 European Association of Urology guideline summary provides updated information on definition, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of male UI.

Patient Summary

Male urinary incontinence comprises a broad subject area, much of which has been covered for the first time in the literature in a single manuscript. The European Association of Urology Non-neurogenic Male Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms Guideline Panel has released this new guidance, with the aim to provide updated information for urologists to be able to follow diagnostic and therapeutic indications for optimising patient care.

### Assessment of the pelvic floor and associated musculoskeletal system: guide for medical practitioners [^117533rR]. Female Pelvic Medicine & Reconstructive Surgery (2021). High credibility.

Clinical relevance of pelvic floor muscle dysfunction (PFMD) — "Pelvic floor muscle dysfunction(s) are extremely varied and quite common", and the International Continence Society categorizes dysfunction as "either underactive or overactive". Underactive PFMs occur "when PFMs are unable to voluntarily contract when appropriate" and urinary incontinence is "reported in 25% of young women, 44–57% in middle-aged and postmenopausal women, and 75% in older women". Overactive PFMs are "defined as PFMs that have an inability to relax or may even contract when relaxation is functionally needed (ie, during micturition or defecation)", and pelvic pain has a "prevalence range of 3.8–24%". Musculoskeletal disorders, particularly pelvic floor myofascial pain associated with chronic pelvic pain, "can range from 21% to 85%", and "patients with bladder and bowel dysfunction(s) may have compensatory elevated or overactive PFM tone".

### The severity of bowel dysfunction in patients with neurogenic bladder [^114JWott]. The Journal of Urology (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

Patients with neurological conditions often experience severe debilitating lower urinary and bowel dysfunction in addition to the physical disabilities. However, only the bladder has received the attention of medical providers with neurogenic bowel being poorly understood and characterized.

Materials and Methods

This is a cross-sectional analysis of a prospective institutional neurogenic bladder database from 2010 to 2013.

Results

Of the 175 patients 60.6% had traumatic spinal cord injury and 18.3% had multiple sclerosis. Median ± SD FISI (Fecal Incontinence Severity Index) scores were 18.0 ± 1.39 (moderate). The median neurogenic bowel dysfunction score was 11.0 ± 0.63 (moderate). Those scores were worse in those patients with spinal cord injury and spina bifida compared to those with other diseases and in younger patients (each p = 0.020), and those in the spinal cord injury group with higher levels of injury (p = 0.0046). Based on the Bristol stool scale 65% of patients had abnormal stool consistency, mostly constipation. None of the FISI, Bristol or neurogenic bowel dysfunction scores correlated significantly with SF-12® quality of life measures. However, bladder symptom scores on M-ISI (Michigan Incontinence Symptom Index) (p = 0.05) and AUA-SI (American Urological Association symptom index) (p = 0.03) correlated with FISI severity while the neurogenic bowel dysfunction score correlated with M-ISI (ρ = 0.29, p = 0.02). Patients with abnormal stool consistency on the Bristol scale reported more urgency and stress incontinence on M-ISI.

Conclusions

Bowel dysfunction is common among patients with neurogenic bladder. Those with worse bladder symptoms also experience worse bowel dysfunction. This highlights the importance of addressing both bowel and bladder dysfunction in this often poorly understood population.

### A concept analysis of dignity-protective continence care for care dependent older people in long-term care settings [^116aycnn]. BMC Geriatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Despite the fact that respect for human dignity is widely promoted and, arguably, lies at the heart of care, international reports identify a lack of attention to the dignity of older people in care homes and hospitals. According to the findings of the 2018 Care Quality Commission (CQC) NHS Inpatient Survey in the UK, almost one fifth of respondents did not feel they were treated with respect and dignity at all times. In Australia the recent Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety found that more than half of the complaints made about the quality of care in its residential aged care homes, related to compromises to personal dignity. Hence, there is a needs to focus on how dignity is enacted for people with continence care needs in such settings.

While cognisant of the elusive nature of the term 'dignity, we propose it could nevertheless be an important value or guiding principle in an ethic of care for older people who need assistance with toileting, incontinence or bladder or bowel care, hereafter referred to as continence care. Continence care has been defined as "the total package tailored to meet the individual needs of patients with bladder and bowel problems". For the purposes of this paper 'continence care' refers to assistance with bladder and/or bowel function which includes supporting a person to maintain continence and manage incontinence. Continence care activities that aim to maintain a person's continence include helping them to use the toilet or altering the environment to prevent disability incontinence. Continence care activities that centre on managing incontinence include assisting a person to apply or change incontinence products (eg absorbent pads, ostomies and urinary catheters), helping them with their personal hygiene after an episode of incontinence and adopting measures to protect their skin from incontinence-associated dermatitis.

### Incontinence during and following hospitalisation: a prospective study of prevalence, incidence and association with clinical outcomes [^117PiyPL]. Age and Ageing (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this secondary analysis of a prospective cohort of acutely hospitalised older adults, one third of participants reported incontinence in the 2 weeks prior to hospitalisation, with one in four experiencing urinary incontinence and one in seven experiencing faecal incontinence (Figure 1). About one quarter of patients reported incontinence at discharge and at 30-day follow-up, but these figures concealed complex trajectories of incontinence which have not been well characterised previously. In previously continent participants, 13.1% experienced new incontinence at hospital discharge, and 15.8% reported incontinence at 30 days. Somewhat unexpectedly, more than half of previously incontinent participants did not report incontinence at discharge or at 30 days follow-up. Overall 47.5% of the cohort described incontinence at one or more time points, highlighting how commonly incontinence is experienced in the peri-hospital period for older hospitalised adults. Hospital-acquired incontinence was equally common in medical and surgical patients, although post-hospital incontinence was more common in medical patients.

### Comparative outcomes for older adults undergoing surgery for bladder and bowel dysfunction [^114Bx8dL]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2021). Medium credibility.

Background/Objectives

To compare surgical outcomes between vulnerable nursing home (NH) residents and matched community-dwelling older adults undergoing surgery for bladder and bowel dysfunction.

Design

Retrospective cohort study.

Participants

A total of 55,389 NH residents and propensity matched (based on procedure, age, sex, race, comorbidity, and year) community-dwelling older adults undergoing surgery for bladder and bowel dysfunction [female pelvic surgery, transurethral resection of the prostate, suprapubic tube placement, hemorrhoid surgery, rectal prolapse surgery]. Individuals were identified using Medicare claims and the Minimum Data Set (MDS) for NH residents between 2014 and 2016.

Measurements

Thirty-day complications, 1-year mortality, and weighted changes in healthcare resource utilization (hospital admissions, emergency room visits, office visits) in the year before and after surgery.

Results

NH residents demonstrated statistically significant increased risk of 30-day complications [60.1% v. 47.2%; RR 1.3 (95% CI 1.3–1.3)] and 1-year mortality [28.9% vs. 21.3%; RR 1.4 (95% CI 1.3–1.4)], compared to community-dwelling older adults. NH residents also demonstrated decreased healthcare resource utilization, compared to community-dwelling older adults, changing from 3.9 to 1.9 (vs.1.1 to 1.0) hospital admissions, 11 to 10.1 (vs. 9 to 9.7) office visits, and 3.4 to 2.2 (vs. 1.9 to 1.9) emergency room visits from the year before to after surgery.

Conclusion

Despite matching on several important clinical characteristics, NH residents demonstrated increased rates of 30-day complications and 1-year mortality after surgery for bowel and bladder dysfunction, while demonstrating decreased healthcare resource utilization. These mixed findings suggest that outcomes may be more varied among vulnerable older adults and warrant further investigation.

### The AUA / SUFU guideline on adult neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction: diagnosis and evaluation [^111EGF4v]. The Journal of Urology (2021). High credibility.

Neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction after lower urinary tract reconstruction incorporating bowel — In NLUTD patients who have undergone lower urinary tract reconstruction incorporating a bowel segment(s), the clinician should assess the patient annually with a focused history, physical exam, and symptom assessment; a basic metabolic panel; and urinary tract imaging (Expert opinion). Those with NLUTD require lifelong surveillance as complications are not uncommon, and patients with bladder augmentation using bowel or a history of continent or incontinent diversion may be at risk for metabolic disturbances, with those with continent diversions at higher risk; at a minimum, the Panel recommends lifelong surveillance with history/physical examination and assessment of any symptoms related to the reconstruction, a basic metabolic panel is similarly recommended to assess for electrolyte or acid-base abnormalities and to guide treatment for asymptomatic metabolic disturbances, and if terminal ileum is used, B12 levels should be monitored over time and supplemented if appropriate.

### The human colon: evidence for degenerative changes during aging and the physiological consequences [^115Y3zst]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

The elderly experience diminished abdominal pain. Furthermore, the prevalence of lower bowel disorders is increased. For example, estimates of chronic constipation among elderly within the community are > 7% to > 42%, rising to > 50% within nursing homes. Chronic constipation is associated with impaired quality of life and complications which if untreated, can lead to fecal impaction, incontinence, bowel perforations, and increased healthcare costs. Fecal incontinence, more common in older adults, may encourage institutionalization.,

Medications are often used by the elderly, including opioid receptor agonists (pain relief), drugs antagonizing at muscarinic acetylcholine and other receptors (e.g. antidepressants), and antagonists of Cav1 voltage gated calcium channels (raised blood pressure). These may alleviate abdominal pain and/or disrupt GI motility. Constipation among the elderlycan also be associated with disease (e.g. clinical depression, hypothyroidism, and long‐term survival of colorectal/anal carcinoma,), and changed lifestyle (e.g. reduced calorie and fluid intake and impaired mobility). The existence and influence of age‐related degeneration on human bowel functions is less clear.

### Third-line therapy for overactive bladder in the elderly: nuances and considerations [^112rMG9f]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2022). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Overactive bladder (OAB) is a symptom complex including urinary urgency, frequency, and/or nocturia, with or without urinary incontinence. While common in the general population, OAB disproportionally impacts older adults in both prevalence and severity. Population‐based studies estimate over a third of older adults suffer from OAB. The condition is also associated with significant psychosocial and health‐related quality‐of‐life costs in the elderly, causing increased social isolation, anxiety, depression, and fall risk. Its economic burden is substantial as well: a 2010 analysis estimated a national cost of $83 billion by 2020, over half of which arises from costs associated with patients over age 65.

Current updated 2019 guidelines from the American Urological Association (AUA) and Society of Urodynamics, Female Pelvic Medicine and Urogenital Reconstruction on the diagnosis and management of OAB provide a treatment algorithm based on progression from least to most invasive options. Behavioral therapies and lifestyle modifications represent the foundation, with pharmacotherapy as second‐line therapy, and procedural interventions as third‐line options.

Pharmacotherapy for OAB, which includes anticholinergic and/or beta‐3 agonist medications, is often problematic in elderly patients. Anticholinergics have well‐known side effects of constipation, dry mouth, blurred vision, core temperature dysregulation, and cognitive impairment. Of particular concern in the elderly, recent studies have suggested a strong association between anticholinergic use and risk of incident dementia. Additionally, elderly patients are more likely to have contraindications to OAB pharmacotherapy use due to higher comorbidity indices and polypharmacy.

The greater severity and burden of OAB symptoms in older patients coupled with concerns surrounding the adverse effects of anticholinergic OAB medications should motivate us to optimize nonpharmacologic therapies in older patients. At the same time, multiple aspects of aging may impact treatment efficacy and decision‐making. This narrative review will summarize the current evidence regarding third‐line therapy use in the elderly and discuss nuances and treatment considerations specific to the elderly OAB population.

### The aging lower urinary tract [^114nJhDX]. The Journal of Urology (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose

Age related changes in continence and the GU system, and how they affect the management of LUT dysfunction are discussed. Guidelines are offered regarding the diagnosis and management of incontinence in the elderly population.

Materials and Methods

Published literature and current treatment practice specific to elderly patients with LUT dysfunction were reviewed.

Results

LUT symptoms in the elderly population are affected by the high prevalence of comorbidity and polypharmacy. In addition, the GU system undergoes age related changes that increase the risk of LUT dysfunction.

Conclusions

Incontinence in older persons is almost always caused by multiple factors, of which not all are directly related to the GU system. Issues such as polypharmacy, comorbidity, and the increased risk of medication side effects must be considered in planning treatment. The primary care physician and urologist or gynecologist should establish a partnership to co-manage the broad spectrum of factors affecting continence in elderly patients.

### Effectiveness of non-pharmacological interventions delivered at home for urinary and faecal incontinence with homebound older people: systematic review of randomised controlled trials [^115WVXvs]. Age and Ageing (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Robust evidence supporting conservative in-home interventions for older people with UI was found in a limited number of small studies. Randomised controlled trials of interventions for management of faecal incontinence have not been conducted in this population and setting. These and other approaches, so far only tested in younger age ranges or in institutional or other group settings, but with potential for delivery at home, warrant further research to build the evidence base for continence promotion among older people. Research that tailors urinary and faecal incontinence interventions to the specific needs of homebound women and men is imperative to improve the quality of life in this growing population.

### Priorities for treatment research from different professional perspectives [^1127K36R]. Gastroenterology (2004). Low credibility.

The consensus conference "Advancing the Treatment of Fecal and Urinary Incontinence Through Research" had as one of its goals the development of a comprehensive list of research priorities. Experts from all disciplines that treat incontinence-gastroenterology, pediatric gastroenterology, urology, urogynecology, colorectal surgery, geriatrics, neurology, nursing, and psychology-and patient advocates were asked to identify their highest priorities for treatment-related research. Meeting participants were shown the aggregated list and invited to propose additional priorities. Treatments for fecal incontinence (biofeedback, sphincteroplasty, antidiarrheal and laxative medications, and sacral nerve stimulation) require validation by randomized, controlled trials. For urinary incontinence, the greatest need is to compare pharmacological, behavioral, and surgical treatments. Trials assessing combined treatments (e.g., biofeedback plus surgery vs. surgery alone or biofeedback alone) are also needed. New drugs are needed that target anal canal resting pressure in fecal incontinence and hypersensitivity to distention in urge urinary incontinence. It may be possible to substantially reduce the incidence of incontinence through modification of obstetric practices (e.g., avoiding episiotomies or offering elective cesarean delivery to high-risk patients), providing pelvic floor exercises before childbirth, and educating patients to avoid straining during defecation. For the elderly, practical behavioral and pharmacological treatments are needed that can postpone or avoid institutionalization. Social science research may identify ways to counteract the social stigma of fecal incontinence and assist physicians in providing patients with more comprehensive and understandable information on the risks associated with different treatment options.

### What characteristics predispose to continence in nursing home residents? a population-based cross-sectional study [^111BLSwj]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2015). Low credibility.

Measures

FI and UI in this study were defined as "involuntary leakage of stool/urine at least a few times a month". The leakage frequency was based on a severity index for urinary incontinence (SIUI) which is created by a frequency score multiplied with a volume score. If the resident had UI, the RNs were asked to answer the following question: "How often does the resident have involuntary leakage of urine?" The following answering options and score were available:less than once a month, a few times a month, a few times a week andevery day and/or night. The same question and labeling were used to ask about fecal incontinence. The next question was: "How much urine does the resident lose each time?" with the following answering options and scores:drops, small splashes andmore. There were no questions about fecal volume. A dependent variable "severity of incontinence", was constructed from the severity index for urinary incontinence (SIUI)and frequency of FI. In order to give UI and FI approximately the same weight, FI frequency was multiplied by two, which gives: (UI frequency × UI volume) + (FI frequency × 2) = severity of incontinence. The variable "cognitive impairment" is based on the question: "According to your assessment, is the resident aware of the current time, place and situation?" The registered nurses could answer "yes", "no" or "partly" to this question. Both "no" and "partly" are taken as cognitive impairment in this paper. Barthel's ADL index was used to obtain information about the residents' activities of daily living (ADL)-functioning, with the scores from 0 to 20 (20 is the best score). To prevent confounding, ADL score was computed without the bowel- and urine domains when used in multivariable analysis with incontinence/continence as effect variable (scores from 0 to 16, where 16 is best score). In bivariate analysis separate domains from Barthel's ADL index were used.

### Pathology of the conus medullaris and cauda equina. beyond the usual suspects [^114EgYrP]. Insights Into Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Disorders affecting the conus medullaris and the nerve roots of the cauda equina often produce overlapping clinical symptoms, making differentiation challenging. The conus medullaris, forming the terminal segment of the spinal cord, typically resides at the T12–L1 vertebral level. Injury or disease at this junction-particularly between T12 and L2-can result in conus medullaris syndrome, which is characterized by a combination of upper and lower motor neuron deficits due to involvement of both the spinal cord and adjacent nerve roots.

In contrast, cauda equina syndrome arises from damage or compression of the nerve roots below the conus, most commonly due to acute herniation of a lumbar intervertebral disc, but also from other causes such as trauma, tumors, or infections. This syndrome is considered a neurological emergency and, while rare, has an estimated incidence of about 1 in 65,000 individuals.

The clinical manifestations of cauda equina syndrome can develop suddenly or progress over time, and diagnosis generally requires the presence of at least two hallmark features: sensory disturbances in the perianal or "saddle" region, and dysfunction of bowel, bladder, or sexual function. Additional symptoms may include low back pain, radiating leg pain, lower limb weakness, diminished reflexes, and sensory changes in the legs.

Patients with conus medullaris syndrome may similarly present with severe back pain, saddle anesthesia, urinary retention, bowel incontinence, and lower limb weakness. However, a distinguishing feature is the simultaneous presence of upper and lower motor neuron signs, whereas cauda equina syndrome results exclusively in lower motor neuron deficits.

Given the clinical overlap and the potential for systemic conditions to affect both the conus medullaris and cauda equina, radiologists play a crucial role in identifying the underlying etiology using advanced imaging, particularly MRI. Some pathologies may present with atypical or widespread symptoms, further complicating the clinical picture.

This review aims to outline the most frequent and important causes to consider when evaluating lesions in the conus medullaris and cauda equina regions, as well as to highlight less common entities that should be included in the differential diagnosis. The goal is to enhance diagnostic accuracy and guide appropriate management by recognizing both typical and unusual imaging patterns.

### Bladder bowel dysfunction [^113CwHVd]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Bladder bowel dysfunction (BBD) describes a spectrum of lower urinary tract symptoms associated with bowel complaints. The true incidence of BBD is unknown; however, BBD symptoms represent approximately 40% of pediatric urology consultations. Given the close interaction between the bladder and bowel due to their common innervation as well as associated pelvic floor muscles, patients often present with bowel complaints as well. Increasing awareness of BBD over the past 30 years has led to better diagnostic criteria and treatment methods. In this article, we review the clinical presentation, diagnostic approach, pathophysiology, and treatment options for children with BBD.

Because urinary symptoms generally, and urinary incontinence (UI) specifically, can be stigmatizing for patients, obtaining accurate prevalence data can be problematic; the prevalence of UI varies widely between studies, populations, and countries, although most studies report a prevalence in the range of 25%–45%. Although UI affects both men and women, the prevalence is generally higher in women than men and increases with patient age. Some studies estimate approximately 10% of adult women are affected, although ranges from 5% to 72% have been reported.

UI has a negative impact on quality of life, mental health, and social activities. Of the three most common UI subtypes (stress, urgency, and mixed UI), urgency UI (UUI) and mixed UI (MUI) are generally considered more bothersome than stress UI (SUI). While there is no distinctive definition of MUI in terms of frequency ratio between the stress and urge component, all components of the MUI presentation have a summative impact on the patient who suffers from this condition. UI also imposes an economic burden on both patients and society at large. Associated costs vary between countriesand UI type, with USD 65.9 billion estimated for UUI in 2007, which the same study projected to USD 82.6 billion for 2020.

SUI and UUI are caused by different physiological mechanismsand therefore have different treatment options. In general, treatment options include behavioral and lifestyle changes, pharmacologic intervention, and surgery. Behavioral programs, which are noninvasive and therefore often a first line of therapy, can cost USD 150 to USD 344 (2015), but whether these programs provide value remains unclear considering that not all participants fully adhere to the program. Several pharmacological interventions are available for UUI, but options are limited for SUI. Pharmacological treatments for UUI have been considered cost‐effective in some analyses, but the cost‐effectiveness decreased for less severe UUI. Surgical interventions are more expensive, but the cost‐effectiveness is harder to measure. Treatment options for MUI, which comprises both stress and urgency UI, are usually limited to treating the predominant symptom (stress OR urgency), rather than treating MUI directly.

### The effect of conservative treatment of urinary incontinence among older and frail older people: a systematic review [^113WP783]. Age and Ageing (2015). Low credibility.

Background

urinary incontinence (UI) is a common symptom among older people, with a higher prevalence among frail older persons living in nursing homes. Despite consequences such as reduced health and quality of life, many older people do not seek help for their symptoms, resulting in missed opportunity for treatment.

Objective

the aim of this study was to investigate the evidence and the effect of conservative treatment of UI and the quality of life among older and frail older persons.

Methods

a systematic review of randomised controlled studies and prospective, non-randomised studies was conducted, evaluating interventions of conservative treatment of UI in an older population (65 years or older). A total of 23 studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria and 9 were of high or moderate quality. Fourteen studies were of low quality and were therefore excluded from the analysis.

Results

documented and effective conservative treatments are available even for older persons with UI. Pelvic muscle exercise, physical training in combination with ADL, prompted voiding and attention training, and help to toilet are important treatments. In some studies, however, the evidence of effectiveness is limited.

Conclusions

this systematic review concludes that there are conservative treatments for UI for older and frail older persons that reduce leakage and increase quality of life. There is however a need for further high-quality studies.

### American Urogynecologic Society best practice statement: evaluation and counseling of patients with pelvic organ prolapse [^114bWFk3]. Female Pelvic Medicine & Reconstructive Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Pelvic organ prolapse (POP) patient history — Eliciting prolapse-related symptoms and their quality-of-life impact is the primary goal, and a patient reporting vaginal bulge that she can see or palpate is the most specific symptom for POP observed on examination. A detailed history of vaginal symptoms to be elicited includes vaginal bulging, pelvic pressure and discomfort, bleeding, discharge, splinting/ digitation, and low backache. In addition, urinary symptoms should be obtained, including increased daytime urinary frequency, nocturia, urinary incontinence, difficulty voiding (hesitancy, slow stream, intermittency, straining to void, and position-dependent micturition), and the sensation of incomplete bladder emptying. Inquiries should be made to uncover any symptoms of bowel dysfunction including constipation, diarrhea, fecal urgency, straining to defecate, feeling of incomplete bowel evacuation, and anal, fecal, or flatal incontinence, and a history of splinting or digitation to empty the bladder or rectum should also be elicited. Because POP can overlap with other conditions, other known etiologies should also be considered, and constipation, diarrhea, anal incontinence, feeling of incomplete bowel evacuation, and rectal bleeding should be evaluated for other causes.
