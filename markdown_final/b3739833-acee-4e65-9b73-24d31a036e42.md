## Question

Between quetiapine and olanzapine, which has a more favorable metabolic side-effect profile?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which antipsychotic — quetiapine or olanzapine — has the more favorable metabolic side-effect profile. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define a "favorable metabolic profile" in terms of weight, glucose, and lipids. Then, I should compare weight gain across head-to-head trials and meta-analyses. Next, I will evaluate glucose dysregulation and diabetes risk. After that, I will assess lipid effects. I should also consider the credibility and recency of the evidence, including FDA labeling and prospective cohorts. Finally, I'll synthesize and state a clear conclusion with practical monitoring implications, since these domains drive cardiovascular risk and are the core class warnings for second-generation antipsychotics.

> Let me first confirm what "favorable metabolic profile" means clinically: lower propensity for weight gain, less dyslipidemia, and reduced risk of hyperglycemia or diabetes progression, given that these changes accelerate cardiometabolic disease in serious mental illness and are the focus of antipsychotic class warnings and monitoring recommendations [^111ZBCCe] [^111wTXoy] [^112yKkP1].

> Now, I will examine weight gain, but wait, I should verify both head-to-head and network data to avoid over-reliance on any single source; across comparative evidence, olanzapine consistently produces greater weight gain than most SGAs and more than quetiapine in aggregate comparisons, with meta-analytic and cohort signals pointing to higher long-term weight accrual on olanzapine while quetiapine sits in an intermediate-risk tier, not neutral but generally less than olanzapine [^113d7VGm] [^115T5EDC] [^116ApPPm] [^1161WBy2] [^115UQYfg].

> Next, I should review glucose metabolism and diabetes risk; hold on, let me double-check the magnitude and direction across designs because confounding can creep in, yet multiple lines converge: meta-analytic comparisons show greater glucose increases with olanzapine versus quetiapine, a 24-week randomized trial shows a significant OGTT AUC glucose and insulin increase with olanzapine versus a smaller, non-significant glucose AUC change with quetiapine, and prospective cohort data link olanzapine to higher hazards of hyperglycemic progression, while FDA labeling for olanzapine requires explicit glucose monitoring and documents clinically severe hyperglycemia events, whereas quetiapine carries the class warning without as strong drug-specific hyperglycemia signals; a small physiologic study also suggests insulin resistance on olanzapine with quetiapine closer to controls, though I should note the small sample size there [^113d7VGm] [^116G9DGK] [^116aQysE] [^111wTXoy] [^11271j3B] [^112yKkP1] [^114g5rtC].

> I will now examine lipid effects; let me verify rankings and absolute changes because lipid signals vary by analyte and study window, but across comprehensive networks and supporting analyses, olanzapine tends to rank among the worst for increases in triglycerides, total cholesterol, and LDL, while quetiapine shows intermediate effects that are generally less severe than olanzapine though not metabolically neutral, a pattern consistent with earlier pairwise syntheses and aligns with the broader class risk gradient placing olanzapine in a higher-risk cluster [^115NJ87c] [^111umo3K] [^113d7VGm] [^111umo3K].

> Let me check direct head-to-head signals to avoid over-inference from indirect comparisons; in a 24-week randomized study, olanzapine produced greater increases in OGTT glucose AUC and insulin and about 0.9 kg more mean weight gain than quetiapine, and in a one-year randomized trial focused on cognition and functioning, quetiapine was better tolerated with olanzapine associated with frequent metabolic aberrations, reinforcing the directional difference observed in broader evidence [^116G9DGK] [^113FzcFW].

> Hold on, I should verify the credibility and recency of these findings; some network meta-analyses rate the certainty as low for individual pairwise contrasts, yet the direction is consistent across FDA labeling, prospective cohorts, real-world longitudinal causal analyses, and randomized data, with newer studies continuing to flag olanzapine among the highest-risk SGAs and quetiapine as intermediate risk rather than neutral, which lowers the chance that we are being misled by isolated or biased estimates [^115NJ87c] [^116aQysE] [^115UQYfg] [^111umo3K].

> Now, regarding clinical implications, I initially thought olanzapine might be contraindicated in patients with pre-existing metabolic syndrome or diabetes, but wait, I should correct that because FDA labeling does not list a formal contraindication; instead, it emphasizes baseline and periodic glucose and lipid monitoring and caution in patients with diabetes or at risk, which in practice often steers clinicians toward agents with lower metabolic liability when possible, while quetiapine still requires standard metabolic surveillance as part of the class [^111wTXoy] [^112yKkP1] [^111ZBCCe].

> Synthesizing across domains, let me reconsider the totality: olanzapine consistently shows greater weight gain, more adverse effects on glucose homeostasis with higher risk for hyperglycemic progression, and worse lipid perturbations, whereas quetiapine demonstrates intermediate but generally less severe effects across these parameters; head-to-head and network findings, along with FDA labeling and prospective cohorts, collectively support that quetiapine has the more favorable overall metabolic profile compared with olanzapine, acknowledging that quetiapine is not metabolically neutral and still warrants routine monitoring [^116G9DGK] [^113FzcFW] [^115T5EDC] [^115NJ87c] [^116aQysE] [^111wTXoy] [^112yKkP1].

> Therefore, my final answer is that quetiapine has a more favorable metabolic side-effect profile than olanzapine, with clinically meaningful differences seen in randomized, cohort, and network evidence, for example approximately 1 kg less mean weight gain over 24 weeks and smaller, often non-significant short-term glucose AUC changes versus olanzapine, alongside a more benign lipid ranking, making quetiapine the preferable choice when metabolic risk is a primary concern while ensuring ongoing metabolic monitoring for either agent [^116G9DGK] [^115NJ87c] [^111umo3K] [^111wTXoy] [^112yKkP1].

---

Quetiapine is **more favorable than olanzapine** in terms of metabolic consequences [^115NJ87c]. Olanzapine is associated with **greater weight gain** [^113d7VGm], higher risk of hyperglycemia/diabetes [^111wTXoy] [^116aQysE], and more pronounced dyslipidemia [^113PMvW9], while quetiapine has a lower metabolic risk profile. Clinicians should monitor metabolic parameters with both drugs [^111wTXoy] [^112yKkP1], but quetiapine is preferred for patients at higher metabolic risk.

---

## Weight gain and obesity

Olanzapine is associated with **significant weight gain and obesity risk** [^111wTXoy], with higher mean weight gain than quetiapine [^113d7VGm] and a greater proportion gaining ≥ 7% from baseline [^112wHF3y]. Quetiapine also causes weight gain, but **to a lesser extent**, with more moderate increases than olanzapine [^112yKkP1] [^113d7VGm] [^116ApPPm].

---

## Glucose metabolism and diabetes risk

Olanzapine is strongly linked to hyperglycemia [^111wTXoy], insulin resistance, and **increased diabetes risk** [^116aQysE], with higher rates of hyperglycemia and glycosuria than quetiapine. Quetiapine has a **lower risk** of hyperglycemia and diabetes than olanzapine [^116G9DGK], with less pronounced effects on glucose metabolism [^112yKkP1] [^114g5rtC].

---

## Lipid metabolism and dyslipidemia

Olanzapine is associated with **significant dyslipidemia** [^111wTXoy], including increases in triglycerides and cholesterol [^113PMvW9], and shows greater lipid abnormalities than quetiapine [^111umo3K]. Quetiapine has a **lower risk** of dyslipidemia than olanzapine, with less pronounced lipid abnormalities [^113PMvW9] [^115T5EDC].

---

## Metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular risk

Olanzapine confers a **higher risk of metabolic syndrome** [^115ZDpaj] and cardiovascular disease [^1121vrkz] because of greater weight gain, hyperglycemia [^111wTXoy], and dyslipidemia. Quetiapine has a **lower risk** of metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease than olanzapine [^113hgBGD] [^1121vrkz].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Clinical guidelines recommend **regular monitoring of weight, glucose, and lipid parameters** [^111wTXoy] for both drugs [^112yKkP1] and emphasize olanzapine's higher metabolic risk. Quetiapine is **preferred** for patients with higher baseline metabolic risk or existing metabolic conditions.

---

Quetiapine is **more favorable than olanzapine** regarding metabolic consequences, with lower risks of weight gain, hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and metabolic syndrome [^113d7VGm] [^115NJ87c].

### Head-to-head comparisons of metabolic side effects of second generation antipsychotics in the treatment of schizophrenia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113d7VGm]. Schizophrenia Research (2010). Low credibility.

The metabolic side effects of second-generation antipsychotics (SGA) are serious and have not been compared head to head in a meta-analysis. We conducted a meta-analysis of studies comparing the metabolic side effects of the following SGAs head-to-head: amisulpride, aripiprazole, clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, sertindole, ziprasidone, and zotepine.

- **Method**: We searched the register of the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group (last search May 2007), supplemented by MEDLINE and EMBASE (last search January 2009) for randomized, blinded studies comparing the above-mentioned SGAs in the treatment of schizophrenia or related disorders. At least three reviewers extracted the data independently. The primary outcome was weight change. We also assessed changes in cholesterol and glucose. The results were combined in a meta-analysis.

- **Results**: We included 48 studies with 105 relevant arms. Olanzapine produced more weight gain than all other second-generation antipsychotics except for clozapine, where no difference was found. Clozapine produced more weight gain than risperidone, risperidone more than amisulpride, and sertindole more than risperidone. Olanzapine produced more cholesterol increase than aripiprazole, risperidone, and ziprasidone. No differences with amisulpride, clozapine, and quetiapine were found. Quetiapine produced more cholesterol increase than risperidone and ziprasidone. Olanzapine produced more increase in glucose than amisulpride, aripiprazole, quetiapine, risperidone, and ziprasidone; no difference was found with clozapine.

### Comparative effects of 18 antipsychotics on metabolic function in patients with schizophrenia, predictors of metabolic dysregulation, and association with psychopathology: A systematic review and network meta-analysis [^113PMvW9]. The Lancet Psychiatry (2020). Low credibility.

For changes in triglycerides, 34 studies compared 15 different antipsychotics (10,965 patients) with placebo (3,021 patients). Compared with placebo, we found no strong evidence of change in triglyceride concentrations with brexpiprazole, lurasidone, sertindole, cariprazine, ziprasidone, aripiprazole, risperidone and paliperidone, amisulpride, haloperidol, and iloperidone (figure 2). Triglyceride concentrations increased with quetiapine, olanzapine, zotepine, and clozapine (figure 2; appendix p. 45). Ranking on the basis of degree of associated triglyceride alteration identified brexpiprazole as the best and clozapine the worst (figure 3; appendix p. 48). The value of τ was 0.07 mmol/L, considered small in the context of the observed antipsychotic-associated changes, and I² was 42.6% (moderate). The global Q score for inconsistency was 45.07 (p < 0.0001), but out of 105 treatment comparisons, we only identified four hotspots of inconsistency, showing disagreement between indirect and direct evidence (appendix p. 58). Certainty of evidence was low or very low in 97 (92%) of 105 comparisons (appendix p. 77).

For changes in fasting glucose, 37 studies compared 16 different antipsychotics (10,681 patients) with placebo (3,032 patients). Compared with placebo, we found no strong evidence of change in glucose concentrations with amisulpride, asenapine, sertindole, ziprasidone, brexpiprazole, quetiapine, risperidone and paliperidone, aripiprazole, haloperidol, cariprazine, and iloperidone (figure 2). Glucose concentrations reduced with lurasidone and increased with olanzapine, zotepine, and clozapine.

### Olanzapine [^111wTXoy]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Atypical antipsychotic drugs have been associated with metabolic changes including hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and weight gain. These metabolic changes may be linked to an increased cardiovascular or cerebrovascular risk. Olanzapine's specific metabolic profile is detailed below.

- **Hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus**: Healthcare providers should weigh the risks and benefits when prescribing olanzapine to patients with an established diagnosis of diabetes mellitus or those with borderline increased blood glucose levels (fasting 100 to 126 mg/dL, nonfasting 140 to 200 mg/dL). Patients taking olanzapine should be monitored regularly for any deterioration in glucose control. Those beginning treatment with olanzapine should undergo fasting blood glucose testing at the initiation of therapy and periodically thereafter.

	- All patients treated with atypical antipsychotics should be observed for symptoms of hyperglycemia, including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. If symptoms of hyperglycemia develop during treatment with atypical antipsychotics, patients should undergo fasting blood glucose testing. In some instances, hyperglycemia has resolved upon discontinuation of the atypical antipsychotic, although some patients required continued anti-diabetic treatment notwithstanding the cessation of the suspect medication [see Patient Counseling Information (17)].

	- Severe hyperglycemia, sometimes leading to ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar coma, or even death, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics, including olanzapine.

- **Metabolic changes**: Atypical antipsychotic drugs have been associated with metabolic changes that include hyperglycemia/diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and body weight gain. All drugs in this class have shown potential to cause metabolic changes; however, each drug has its own specific risk profile. In clinical studies, some patients experienced worsening in more than one metabolic parameter, such as weight, blood glucose, and lipids. These changes in metabolic profiles should be managed as clinically appropriate.

- **Hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus**: Hyperglycemia, sometimes extreme and associated with ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar coma, or death, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics, including quetiapine. The assessment of the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and glucose abnormalities is complicated by the potential increased background risk of diabetes mellitus in patients with schizophrenia, as well as the rising incidence of diabetes mellitus in the general population. Given these confounding factors, the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions is not completely understood. However, epidemiological studies suggest an increased risk of hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics. Precise risk estimates for hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics are not available.

### Abnormalities of glucose metabolism associated with atypical antipsychotic drugs [^1172E33Q]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

The introduction of atypical antipsychotic drugs has provided a clear benefit for many schizophrenia patients, with less risk for the extrapyramidal side effects associated with conventional antipsychotics. However, some antipsychotics are associated with an increased risk of adverse metabolic outcomes, including weight gain, dyslipidemia, and hyperglycemia. Increases in adiposity and disturbances in glucose and lipid metabolism represent a serious health risk in patients who may be predisposed to these metabolic conditions. The increased risk for diabetes with certain antipsychotics may be associated with the risk of treatment-induced weight gain. However, other mechanisms, including effects on central neurotransmitters and direct effects on glucose metabolism, may contribute to the development of disordered glucose metabolism. The purpose of this article is to review the association between antipsychotic medications and obesity, insulin resistance, and diabetes, including the mechanisms through which these changes might be effected.

### Comparative effects of 18 antipsychotics on metabolic function in patients with schizophrenia, predictors of metabolic dysregulation, and association with psychopathology: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^111YPCAk]. The Lancet Psychiatry (2020). Low credibility.

We used strict inclusion criteria to obtain a homogeneous sample. We found no evidence of inconsistency for network meta-analyses examining change in BMI, LDL cholesterol, and HDL cholesterol, supporting the robustness of these outcomes. However, we had some concerns regarding inconsistency in the network meta-analyses of triglycerides and glucose and more significant concerns for the network meta-analysis of weight. These network meta-analyses showed evidence of global inconsistency, although only a small number of local hotspots of inconsistency. Inconsistency might have been secondary to imbalances in the distribution of some effect modifiers observed across comparisons, small study effects, and publication bias noted in pairwise meta-analyses. Only a small proportion of studies (16%) showed no evidence of bias, and confidence in the evidence of the comparisons across all parameters was low or very low for 50–100% of treatment comparisons. Notably, the most recent and largest network meta-analysis examining comparative treatment efficacy of various antipsychotics identified the same issue, with confidence of outcomes for 75% of treatment comparisons regarded as low or very low. However, our sensitivity analyses excluding patients with first-episode psychosis, treatment-resistant psychosis, older adults, and low-quality studies found similar results to the overall findings, and measures of inconsistency were largely unchanged, supporting the inclusion of these data in primary analyses.

### Signs and symptoms associated with the metabolic syndrome in psychiatric inpatients receiving antipsychotics: A retrospective chart review [^111ukNTB]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2007). Low credibility.

The objective of this study is to address the fact that the metabolic syndrome has been recognized as a major health risk for patients taking atypical antipsychotics. Few studies have examined large samples of psychiatric patients to explore the prevalence of the signs and symptoms associated with this condition.

- **Method**: The investigators retrospectively identified all inpatient admissions at the study site who were treated with antipsychotics during 2003 (N = 1691) and extracted demographic and clinical data, including measures associated with the syndrome: body mass index > 30 kg/m², dyslipidemia, diagnosis of hypertension or diabetes. Stepwise logistic regression was used to identify variables associated with each correlate of the syndrome.

- **Results**: In the majority of this sample (69.3%), at least one correlate of the metabolic syndrome was present. The odds that a patient would have one or more of these measures were approximately eight times greater for those receiving clozapine than for those receiving another antipsychotic medication. These patients also had increased odds (odds ratio = 2.5) of having hypertension or diabetes. In the subsample of patients with documentation for all five correlates of the metabolic syndrome (N = 362), 18.8% had three or more of the five.

- **Conclusion**: The prevalence of at least three correlates in psychiatric inpatients receiving antipsychotics is probably an underestimate because diagnosis was substituted for the blood pressure and glucose measures. Nonetheless, these findings support the call for routine screening for metabolic symptoms in patients receiving antipsychotics.

- **Race**: Olanzapine ranked fourth among trials with more white than non-white patients in elevating fasting serum glucose, but ranked below placebo among trials with more non-white patients [SMD = −0.12 mmol/L, 95% CI = (−0.69, 0.44) mmol/L]. Olanzapine also ranked first in elevating TC levels and ranked higher than most of the other interventions in elevating body weight in both subgroups.

- **Intervention duration**: Risperidone ranked higher than the other interventions in elevating fasting serum glucose levels in the short-term subgroup [SMD = 0.56 mmol/L, 95% CI = (0.04, 1.07) mmol/L, compared to placebo], while lurasidone ranked significantly higher than risperidone in the long-term subgroup [SMD = 2.39 mmol/L, 95% CI = (1.63, 3.15) mmol/L]. Quetiapine overcame placebo in elevating insulin in the short-term subgroup [SMD = 0.33 pmol/L, 95% CI = (0.06, 0.61) pmol/L]. As for TC, quetiapine ranked first in the short-term group but ranked fourth in the long-term subgroup. Amisulpride exhibited the most potent effects on body weight in the short-term subgroup. There was no RCT of long-term amisulpride, while quetiapine and olanzapine ranked significantly higher than most of the other interventions in elevating body weight in the long-term subgroup.

### Cognition, functioning and quality of life in schizophrenia treatment: Results of a one-year randomized controlled trial of olanzapine and quetiapine [^113FzcFW]. Schizophrenia Research (2007). High credibility.

Cognitive deficits are recognized as a critical determinant of functional outcomes in schizophrenia, and second-generation antipsychotic drugs have been touted for their potential to enhance cognitive functioning and community tenure.

- **Objectives**: The study examined the relative merits of olanzapine and quetiapine in improving cognitive deficits and enhancing psychosocial functioning in a sample of community-dwelling adults previously treated with first-generation antipsychotic drugs for schizophrenia.

- **Methods**: In a prospective, rater-blinded study, 86 participants were randomized to receive either olanzapine or quetiapine, and assessed at baseline and after 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. Outcome measures included symptoms and side effects rating scales, the subjective scale to investigate cognition in schizophrenia (SSTICS), a computer-assisted cognitive test battery (COGLAB), the sickness impact profile (SIP), the global assessment of functioning (GAF) scale, and the drug attitude inventory (DAI).

- **Results**: Both olanzapine and quetiapine were equally effective in improving symptom severity and decreasing neurological side effects. Quetiapine was significantly better tolerated (p = 0.002), improved self-rated cognitive dysfunction (p = 0.002), and subjects' performance on selected neurocognitive tasks (p = 0.01). Olanzapine use was associated with greater symptom stability, fewer dropouts (p = 0.01), and frequent metabolic aberrations (p = 0.001). The accrued benefits of drug therapy, however, were not reflected as significant gains in daily functioning and quality.

### Weight change over two years in people prescribed olanzapine, quetiapine and risperidone in UK primary care: Cohort study in THIN, a UK primary care database [^116ApPPm]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2018). Low credibility.

Follow-up studies of weight gain related to antipsychotic treatment beyond a year are limited in number. We compared weight change in the three most commonly prescribed antipsychotics in a representative UK General Practice database.

- **Method**: We conducted a cohort study in United Kingdom primary care records of people newly prescribed olanzapine, quetiapine, or risperidone. The primary outcome was weight in each six-month period for two years after treatment initiation. Weight changes were compared using linear regression, adjusted for age, baseline weight, and diagnosis.

- **Results**: N = 6,338 people received olanzapine, 12,984 quetiapine, and 6,556 risperidone. Baseline weight was lowest for men treated with olanzapine (80.8 kg versus 83.5 kg quetiapine, 82.0 kg risperidone) and women treated with olanzapine (67.7 kg versus 71.5 kg quetiapine, 68.4 kg risperidone). Weight gain occurred during treatment with all three drugs. Compared with risperidone, mean weight gain was higher with olanzapine (adjusted coefficient +1.24 kg [95% confidence interval: 0.69–1.79 kg per six months] for men and +0.77 kg [95% confidence interval: 0.29–1.24 kg] for women). Weight gain with quetiapine was lower in unadjusted models compared with risperidone, but this difference was not significant after adjustment.

- **Conclusion**: Olanzapine is more commonly prescribed to people with lower weight. However, after accounting for baseline weight, age, sex, and diagnosis, olanzapine is still associated with greater weight gain over two years than risperidone or quetiapine. Baseline weight does not ameliorate these findings.

- **Metabolic changes**: Atypical antipsychotic drugs have been associated with metabolic changes, including hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and weight gain. These metabolic changes may be linked to increased cardiovascular and cerebrovascular risk. Olanzapine's specific metabolic profile is outlined below.

- **Hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus**: Healthcare providers should weigh the risks and benefits when prescribing olanzapine to patients with a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus or those with borderline increased blood glucose levels (fasting 100–126 mg/dL, nonfasting 140–200 mg/dL). Patients taking olanzapine should be regularly monitored for worsening glucose control. Those initiating olanzapine treatment should undergo fasting blood glucose testing at the onset and periodically during treatment. Any patient treated with atypical antipsychotics should be observed for symptoms of hyperglycemia, including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Patients who develop symptoms of hyperglycemia while on atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing. In some cases, hyperglycemia has resolved upon discontinuation of the atypical antipsychotic; however, some patients required continued anti-diabetic treatment despite discontinuation of the suspect drug [see Patient Counseling Information (17)].

Hyperglycemia, sometimes extreme and associated with ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar coma, or death, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics, including olanzapine. Assessment of the relationship between medication and glucose level changes remains crucial.

- **Metabolic changes**: Atypical antipsychotic drugs have been associated with metabolic changes, including hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and weight gain. These metabolic changes may be associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. Olanzapine's specific metabolic profile is presented below.

- **Hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus**: Healthcare providers should carefully consider the risks and benefits before prescribing olanzapine to patients with an established diagnosis of diabetes mellitus or those with borderline increased blood glucose levels (fasting 100–126 mg/dL, nonfasting 140–200 mg/dL). Regular monitoring for worsening glucose control is advised for patients on olanzapine. Patients starting treatment with olanzapine should undergo fasting blood glucose testing at the beginning and periodically during treatment. All patients treated with atypical antipsychotics should be monitored for symptoms of hyperglycemia, including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Should symptoms of hyperglycemia develop, fasting blood glucose testing should be conducted.

### Aristada Initio [^115NftXX]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Atypical antipsychotic drugs have been linked to metabolic changes, including hyperglycemia/diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and weight gain. Although all drugs in this class have been shown to cause some metabolic changes, each drug has a unique risk profile.

- **Hyperglycemia/diabetes mellitus**: Hyperglycemia, which can be extreme and associated with conditions such as ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar coma, or even death, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics. There have been instances of hyperglycemia in patients treated with oral aripiprazole. Determining the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and glucose abnormalities is complex due to factors like the increased background risk of diabetes mellitus in patients with schizophrenia and the rising incidence of diabetes mellitus in the general population. Despite these confounding elements, epidemiological studies indicate an increased risk of hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics.

Patients diagnosed with diabetes mellitus who begin treatment with atypical antipsychotics should be monitored regularly for any deterioration in glucose control. Those with risk factors for diabetes mellitus, such as obesity or a family history of the condition, who are commencing treatment with atypical antipsychotics, should undergo fasting blood glucose testing at the onset of treatment and periodically thereafter.

### Comparative effects of 18 antipsychotics on metabolic function in patients with schizophrenia, predictors of metabolic dysregulation, and association with psychopathology: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^112rHmir]. The Lancet Psychiatry (2020). Low credibility.

All analyses were conducted in R (version 3.5.1). For pairwise comparisons informed by ten or more studies, we synthesized data in a meta-analysis using a random-effects model in the metafor package (version 2.1–0). We investigated the heterogeneity of treatment effects visually by inspecting forest plots, alongside monitoring of τ (SD of random effects) and the I² statistic. To visualize heterogeneity, prediction intervals were included in forest plots. Small study effects and publication bias were assessed by visual inspection of contour-enhanced funnel plots and using Egger's test.

- **Assessment of the transitivity assumption**: Transitivity is the key underlying assumption of network meta-analysis. To assess this assumption, we examined the distribution of possible effect modifiers across treatment comparisons. Potential effect modifiers included age, sex, ethnicity, and body weight.

- **Network meta-analysis**: We fitted random-effects frequentist network meta-analyses, in which we assumed a common random-effects SD (τ) for all comparisons in the network. We fitted our models in R using netmeta (version 1.0–1). Metabolic change for each parameter and each treatment comparison was estimated as mean difference with 95% CIs. We avoided dichotomizing results as statistically significant or not and instead presented results with CIs to allow clinicians to gauge the range of likely effects. Placebo was used as the reference treatment in all forest plots. We created league tables to display the relative degree of metabolic disturbance for all comparisons among antipsychotics.

### Insulin secretion in patients receiving clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine, and risperidone [^1153F22d]. Schizophrenia Research (2013). Low credibility.

Second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) increase the risk of type 2 diabetes. The mechanism is thought to center on drug-induced weight gain, which initiates the dysmetabolic cascade of insulin resistance, increased insulin production, and pancreatic beta-cell failure. An independent effect of SGAs on insulin secretion has been suggested in animal models but has not been demonstrated in clinical samples.

- **Objective**: To determine the post-challenge insulin secretion in patients treated with SGAs.

- **Method**: We identified 520 non-diabetic individuals treated with clozapine (N = 73), olanzapine (N = 190), quetiapine (N = 91), or risperidone (N = 166) in a consecutive, single-site cohort of 783 adult psychiatric inpatients who underwent a comprehensive metabolic assessment. Insulin secretion was measured as the area under the curve (AUC(insulin)) generated by levels recorded at baseline, 30, 60, and 120 minutes after the intake of 75 g of glucose. The independent predictors of insulin secretion were determined with regression analysis in the entire sample and separately in patients with normal glucose tolerance (NGT) and prediabetes.

- **Results**: The post-challenge AUC(insulin) was independently predicted by AUC(glucose), waist circumference, triglyceride levels, and younger age (p < 0.0001); non-smoking status (p = 0.0012); and treatment with clozapine (p = 0.021). The model explained 33.5% of the variance in insulin secretion (p < 0.0001). The clozapine effect was present in the NGT group but not in prediabetics.

- **Conclusions**: Clozapine, but not olanzapine, quetiapine, and risperidone, is an independent predictor of increased insulin secretion in patients with normal glucose tolerance.

### Weight gain, metabolic parameters, and the impact of race in aggressive inpatients randomized to double-blind clozapine, olanzapine or haloperidol [^111Jf3ZQ]. Schizophrenia Research (2009). Low credibility.

The second-generation antipsychotic agents clozapine and olanzapine have been associated with weight gain and increased lipid and glucose blood levels. Since some of the neurotransmitters that are impaired in aggressive patients are involved in lipid/glucose metabolism, aggressive patients may represent a subgroup with a differential profile of adverse metabolic reactions to these medications. The goal of this study was to assess the effects of clozapine and olanzapine in comparison to the first-generation agent haloperidol on these metabolic parameters in aggressive patients with schizophrenia.

- **Method**: 110 inpatients with schizophrenia and a history of physical assaults were included in a randomized double-blind 12-week study. Fasting glucose, cholesterol, and triglycerides were collected at baseline and at the end of the study. Ninety-three patients provided blood samples at baseline and at least at one point after randomization to clozapine (N = 34), olanzapine (N = 31), or haloperidol (N = 28).

- **Results**: There were significant differences among the three medication groups in weight gain and in increases in blood lipids and glucose. Patients on haloperidol showed no increase on any of these parameters. Patients on olanzapine gained the most weight, but patients on clozapine had the greatest increases in cholesterol, triglyceride, and glucose. An effect of ethnicity was observed, as African-American patients were more likely to develop metabolic abnormalities than other ethnic groups, especially on clozapine.

- **Conclusions**: In this prospective randomized trial, clozapine was observed to be associated with significant metabolic changes, particularly in certain ethnic groups.

### The effects of novel antipsychotics on glucose and lipid levels [^112hEUJt]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

The novel antipsychotics are extensively used based on their favorable extrapyramidal side effect profiles. However, accumulating evidence suggests that these agents, particularly clozapine and olanzapine, have serious side effects of their own, including weight gain and elevated glucose and triglyceride levels. The goal of this study is to compare the effects of novel antipsychotics — clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone, and quetiapine — and typical antipsychotics — haloperidol and fluphenazine — on glucose and lipid levels.

- **Method**: The charts of 590 patients were retrospectively reviewed. Of those, 215 patients had adequate laboratory data for inclusion. Glucose and lipid level data from 2 1/2 years before and after the initiation of the target antipsychotic were included. Covariates, including patients' age, the duration of antipsychotic treatment, other medications that may affect glucose or lipid levels, and the initial laboratory values, were controlled for in the analyses.

- **Results**: Glucose levels increased from baseline for patients treated with clozapine, olanzapine, and haloperidol. There were statistically and clinically significant differences among the medications' effects on lipid profiles (p < .05). Those receiving clozapine and olanzapine demonstrated statistically significant increases in triglyceride levels compared with the other groups. Over one-third of patients treated with any of the novel antipsychotics had clinically meaningful triglyceride elevations.

- **Conclusion**: It has been shown that novel antipsychotics are associated with weight gain.

### Longitudinal impact of different treatment sequences of second-generation antipsychotics on metabolic outcomes: a study using targeted maximum likelihood estimation [^115UQYfg]. Psychological Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) cause metabolic side effects. However, patients' metabolic profiles are influenced by time-invariant and time-varying confounders. Real-world evidence on the long-term, dynamic effects of SGAs, including different treatment sequences, is limited. We employed advanced causal inference methods to evaluate the metabolic impact of SGAs in a naturalistic cohort.

- **Methods**: We followed 696 Chinese patients with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders receiving SGAs. Longitudinal targeted maximum likelihood estimation (LTMLE) was used to estimate the average treatment effects (ATEs) of continuous SGA treatment versus 'no treatment' on metabolic outcomes, including total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), triglycerides (TG), fasting glucose (FG), and body mass index (BMI), over 6–18 months at 3-month intervals. LTMLE accounted for time-invariant and time-varying confounders. Post-SGA discontinuation side effects were also assessed.

- **Results**: The ATEs of continuous SGA treatment on BMI and TG showed an inverted U-shaped pattern, peaking at 12 months and declining afterward. Similar patterns were observed for TC and LDL, although the ATEs peaked at 15 months. For FG and HDL, the ATEs peaked at approximately 6 months. The adverse impact of SGAs on BMI persisted even after medication discontinuation, yet other metabolic parameters did not show such lingering side effects. Clozapine and olanzapine exhibited greater metabolic side effects compared to other SGAs.

- **Conclusions**: Our real-world study suggests that metabolic side effects associated with SGAs vary over time and may persist after discontinuation for certain outcomes, such as BMI.

### Risk factors for abnormal glucose metabolism during antipsychotic treatment: A prospective cohort study [^116aQysE]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2023). High credibility.

Antipsychotic medications increase the risk of abnormal glucose metabolism. However, in clinical practice, it is difficult to predict this risk because it is affected by medication-related and background factors. This study aimed to identify the risk factors for abnormal glucose metabolism during antipsychotic treatment. We conducted a multicenter, prospective cohort study in patients with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or bipolar disorder. Patients with prediabetes or possible diabetes were excluded. Finally, 706 patients were included in the analysis.

The hazard ratio (HR) for each factor was calculated for events of progression to hyperglycemia using time-dependent Cox regression analysis, stratified according to facility type and adjusted for available background and drug-related factors. Treatments with olanzapine (HR = 2.06, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.05–4.05), clozapine (HR = 4.25, 95% CI = 1.56–11.60), and chlorpromazine (HR = 4.48, 95% CI = 1.21–16.57), as well as overweight and obesity (HR = 1.57, 95% CI = 1.02–2.41), and hypertriglyceridemia (HR = 1.72, 95% CI = 1.02–2.88), were associated with a significantly higher occurrence of hyperglycemic progression. The number and daily dose of antipsychotics were not associated with their occurrence.

Our study demonstrated that more careful monitoring is necessary during olanzapine, clozapine, and chlorpromazine treatment because of the higher occurrence of abnormalities in glucose metabolism. Furthermore, patients with obesity or hypertriglyceridemia warrant monitoring for the occurrence of abnormal glucose metabolism.

LTMLE accounted for time-invariant and time-varying confounders. Post-SGA discontinuation side effects were also assessed.

- **Results**: The ATEs of continuous SGA treatment on BMI and TG showed an inverted U-shaped pattern, peaking at 12 months and declining afterward.

Clozapine and olanzapine exhibited greater metabolic side effects compared to other SGAs.

- **Conclusions**: Our real-world study suggests that metabolic outcomes associated with SGA treatment are influenced by both the duration and sequence of the treatment, with significant variations in the persistence of side effects.

### Metabolic risks in older adults receiving second-generation antipsychotic medication [^115ZDpaj]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2009). Low credibility.

Metabolic syndrome is prevalent in older adults and increases the risk of cardiovascular disease. Second-generation antipsychotics, such as aripiprazole, clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, and ziprasidone, increase the risk of metabolic syndrome and present many challenges for psychiatrists. In this article, we review the relationships between second-generation antipsychotics and metabolic syndrome with a focus on older adults.

Because few studies focus exclusively on older adults, we augment this review with relevant findings from younger adults. The differential risk factors of each medication are reviewed, as are recent findings in monitoring and treating metabolic syndrome. Olanzapine and clozapine are more strongly associated with metabolic risks, whereas aripiprazole and ziprasidone are less associated. Although lifestyle modifications can help to reduce some aspects of metabolic syndrome, lifestyle modifications in conjunction with metformin therapy appear to be most effective.

### Weight change and metabolic effects of asenapine in patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder [^111Gbnft]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2014). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to describe weight changes and metabolic effects of asenapine compared with placebo and olanzapine in adults.

- **Method**: Post hoc analyses were performed using data from 17 asenapine trials, comprising 13 for schizophrenia and 4 for bipolar mania, with placebo (5–10 mg twice daily; n = 1,748; 1–6 weeks) and/or olanzapine (5–20 mg, once daily; n = 3,430; 3–100 weeks). Data were pooled based on treatment into placebo-controlled and olanzapine-controlled trials. In trials with placebo and olanzapine treatment groups, the asenapine population was included in both pools. Changes from baseline for weight, body mass index, and fasting lipid and glucose levels were determined. The Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities was used to define metabolic adverse events.

- **Results**: Mean (standard error [SE]) weight change was greater with asenapine than with placebo (1.2 [0.2] vs. 0.14 [0.2] kg; P < .0001) and similar in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Mean changes differed for asenapine versus placebo in triglycerides (1.8 [6.3] vs. -12.2 [5.9] mg/dL; P < .01) and fasting glucose (1.9 [1.7] vs. -1.6 [1.5] mg/dL; P < .05). In the olanzapine-controlled trials, weight change was significantly lower with asenapine than with olanzapine (0.9 [0.1] vs. 3.1 [0.2] kg; P < .0001). Changes associated with asenapine were lower than those with olanzapine in fasting glucose (2.0 vs. 3.3 mg/dL), total cholesterol (-0.4 [1.1] vs. 6.2 [1.2] mg/dL; P < .0001), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (-0.3 [1.1] vs. 3.1 [1.2] mg/dL; P < .01), and triglycerides (-0.9 [5.4] vs. 24.3 [5.8] mg/dL; P < .0001).

### Comparative effects of 18 antipsychotics on metabolic function in patients with schizophrenia, predictors of metabolic dysregulation, and association with psychopathology: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^115CKGYx]. The Lancet Psychiatry (2020). Low credibility.

Research in context

- **Evidence before this study**: Antipsychotic drug treatment possibly causes glucose dysregulation and lipid disturbance, thereby contributing to the development of metabolic syndrome in patients with schizophrenia. However, the degree to which metabolic alterations occur in patients treated with various antipsychotics remains unclear. Furthermore, whether baseline patient characteristics can predict metabolic dysregulation is unknown, and the association between metabolic change and change in psychopathology is uncertain. To address these issues, we searched PubMed using the keywords "schizophrenia AND antipsychotic AND (glucose OR cholesterol OR triglycerides OR metabolic)" from inception until July 19, 2019, without language restriction. Selection criteria were network meta-analyses of randomized blinded trials examining antipsychotic treatment of patients with schizophrenia, where outcomes were change in glucose, cholesterol, or triglyceride concentrations. Of the 664 studies retrieved, one network meta-analysis was identified, which examined only a single parameter (glucose concentrations). No studies examined baseline predictors of metabolic change or the relationship between metabolic change and change in psychopathology.

- **Added value of this study**: Our findings show variations in antipsychotics in terms of their metabolic side effects and identify increasing age, male sex, and non-white ethnicity as possible risk factors for antipsychotic-induced metabolic dysregulation. Furthermore, we identified strong evidence that antipsychotic-assoc

### Metabolic syndrome and the risk of coronary heart disease in 367 patients treated with second-generation antipsychotic drugs [^1121vrkz]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2006). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to examine the relationship between the presence of metabolic syndrome and the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) events, including angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, and sudden cardiac death, in patients treated with second-generation antipsychotic medications.

A total of 367 adults treated with these antipsychotics were randomly selected from consecutive psychiatric admissions to a single hospital between August 1, 2004, and March 1, 2005. These individuals underwent assessments to evaluate the presence of metabolic syndrome. The 10-year risk of CHD events was calculated using the Framingham scoring system, which considers age, smoking, total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, blood pressure, and history of diabetes. This risk was compared between patients with and without metabolic syndrome.

Metabolic syndrome was present in 137 patients (37.3%) and was associated with a significantly greater age- and race-adjusted 10-year risk of CHD events: 11.5% vs. 5.3% for men (risk ratio = 2.18, 95% CI = 1.88 to 2.48, p < .0001) and 4.5% vs. 2.3% for women (risk ratio = 1.94, 95% CI = 1.65 to 2.23, p = .0005). The increased risk of CHD events in patients with metabolic syndrome remained significant after excluding diabetic patients.

In a logistic regression analysis of variables independent of the Framingham scoring system, triglyceride levels (p < .0001), waist circumference (p = .035), and white race (p = .047) were significantly associated with the 10-year risk of CHD events (R² = 0.134; p < .0001).

These data confirm the high prevalence of metabolic syndrome among the patient population studied and its significant association with increased CHD risk.

### Risperdal [^112GuGGf]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Metabolic changes**: Atypical antipsychotic drugs have been associated with metabolic changes that may increase cardiovascular and cerebrovascular risk. These metabolic changes include hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and body weight gain. While all drugs in this class have been shown to produce some metabolic changes, each drug has its own specific risk profile.

- **Hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus**: Hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar coma, or death, have been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics, including Risperdal. Assessing the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and glucose abnormalities is complicated by an increased background risk of diabetes mellitus in patients with schizophrenia and the rising incidence of diabetes mellitus in the general population. Given these confounders, the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and hyperglycemia-related adverse events is not completely understood. However, epidemiological studies suggest an increased risk of treatment-emergent hyperglycemia-related adverse events in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics. Precise risk estimates for hyperglycemia-related adverse events in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics are not available.

Patients with an established diagnosis of diabetes mellitus who are started on atypical antipsychotics, including Risperdal, should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control. Patients with risk factors for diabetes mellitus (e.g. obesity and family history) should also be carefully monitored.

### A 24-week, multicenter, open-label, randomized study to compare changes in glucose metabolism in patients with schizophrenia receiving treatment with olanzapine, quetiapine, or risperidone [^116G9DGK]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

This randomized, 24-week, flexible-dose study compared changes in glucose metabolism in patients with DSM-IV schizophrenia who were receiving initial exposure to olanzapine, quetiapine, or risperidone.

- **Method**: The hypothesized primary endpoint was the change from baseline to week 24 in the area under the curve (AUC) for 0- to 2-hour plasma glucose values during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT); the primary analysis compared olanzapine to quetiapine. Secondary endpoints included the mean change in AUC for 0- to 2-hour plasma insulin values, the insulin sensitivity index, and fasting lipids. The first patient enrolled on April 29, 2004, and the last patient completed the study on October 24, 2005.

- **Results**: Mean weight changes over 24 weeks were +3.7 kg for quetiapine, +4.6 kg for olanzapine, and +3.6 kg for risperidone. Based on data from 395 patients (quetiapine, N = 115, with a mean dose of 607.0 mg/day; olanzapine, N = 146, with a mean dose of 15.2 mg/day; and risperidone, N = 134, with a mean dose of 5.2 mg/day), the mean change in AUC for 0- to 2-hour glucose value at week 24 was significantly lower for quetiapine compared to olanzapine (t = 1.98, df = 377, p = .048). Increases in AUC for 0- to 2-hour glucose values were statistically significant with olanzapine (+21.9 mg/dL x h, 95% CI = 11.5 to 32.4 mg/dL x h) and risperidone (+18.8 mg/dL x h, 95% CI = 8.1 to 29.4 mg/dL x h), but not with quetiapine (+9.1 mg/dL x h, 95% CI = -2.3 to 20.5 mg/dL x h). AUC for 0- to 2-hour insulin values increased statistically significantly with olanzapine (+24.5%, 95% CI = 11.5% to 39.0%), but not with quetiapine or risperidone.

### Metabolic risks and effects of atypical antipsychotic treatment [^111Dktvy]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2007). Low credibility.

Weight gain and the associated increased risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease may pose problems for individuals who receive long-term treatment with atypical antipsychotics. Atypical antipsychotics differ in their propensity to cause obesity and other metabolic disturbances. If a patient gains substantial weight while taking atypical antipsychotics, the physician should consider switching them to a drug with a lower risk of weight gain. Additionally, the physician should address patient lifestyle issues, such as a poor diet and lack of exercise.

### Effects of long-term antipsychotics treatment on body weight: A population-based cohort study [^115B2M6t]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2020). Low credibility.

Previous studies have suggested that olanzapine is associated with significant short-term weight gain, whereas risperidone and quetiapine have a moderate effect on weight. In contrast to earlier findings, our study revealed that weight gain did not stabilize during four years of follow-up. Our findings align with previous research by quantifying the long-term effect more accurately.

It was previously suggested that women's weight is more affected by antipsychotic (AP) exposure. However, we found that only olanzapine (in the long term) and quetiapine (in both long and short term) induced more weight gain in women.

Since our study population includes both naïve and recurring antipsychotic consumers, short- and long-term weight gain in olanzapine-naïve individuals and long-term weight gain in risperidone-naïve individuals may be higher than reported. Risperidone seemed to be associated with greater weight gain in men than in women in both the short and long term, with men prescribed olanzapine gaining more weight in the short term.

One recent study reanalyzed the results of 14 clinical trials to explore weight gain variations across doses of olanzapine and risperidone. Their conclusions about olanzapine are consistent with our results, indicating that the excess risk of at least 7% weight gain is 16.1% for low doses (0–10 g chlorpromazine equivalent dose) and 46.8% for high doses (0–20 g chlorpromazine equivalent dose). They could not conclusively determine the effects of risperidone.

### Olanzapine [^11271j3B]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

In an analysis of 8 placebo-controlled studies (median treatment exposure 4 to 5 weeks), 6.1% of olanzapine-treated subjects (N = 855) experienced treatment-emergent glycosuria compared to 2.8% of placebo-treated subjects (N = 599). The study also examined short-term and long-term changes in fasting glucose levels from adult olanzapine monotherapy studies. The mean change in fasting glucose for patients exposed at least 48 weeks was 4.2 mg/dL (N = 487). In analyses of patients who completed 9 to 12 months of olanzapine therapy, mean change in fasting and nonfasting glucose levels continued to increase over time.

- **Olanzapine monotherapy in adolescents**: The safety and efficacy of olanzapine have not been established in patients under the age of 13 years. In an analysis of 3 placebo-controlled olanzapine monotherapy studies of adolescent patients, including those with schizophrenia (6 weeks) or bipolar I disorder (manic or mixed episodes) (3 weeks), olanzapine was associated with a greater mean change from baseline in fasting glucose levels compared to placebo (2.68 mg/dL versus -2.59 mg/dL). The mean change in fasting glucose for adolescents exposed at least 24 weeks was 3.1 mg/dL (N = 121). The study provided insights into short-term and long-term changes in fasting blood glucose levels from adolescent olanzapine monotherapy studies.

### Central nervous system delivery of the antipsychotic olanzapine induces hepatic insulin resistance [^1116v2PR]. Diabetes (2010). Low credibility.

Atypical antipsychotics, such as olanzapine (OLZ), account for the majority of antipsychotic drugs prescribed for the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorders. Furthermore, a multicenter double-blind comparison between several antipsychotics has underscored the efficacy of OLZ compared with other earlier-generation antipsychotics. However, atypical antipsychotics, in particular OLZ, have been associated with serious metabolic side effects, including weight gain, dyslipidemia, and diabetes.

Although it is established that atypical antipsychotics, especially OLZ, are strongly associated with increased weight gain in humans, little is known regarding the mechanisms responsible for this effect. Acutely, two atypical antipsychotics, clozapine and OLZ, increase the consumption of a high-calorie fat emulsion in rodents. Furthermore, weight gain in rats treated for 7 days with OLZ was accounted for by increased food intake. However, hyperphagia and weight gain are not universally observed in animal models of antipsychotic treatment, but increased body adiposity is strongly associated with chronic OLZ administration.

### The metabolic syndrome and its constituting variables in atypical antipsychotic-treated subjects: comparison with other drug treatments, drug-free psychiatric patients, first-degree relatives and the general population in Venezuela [^111rJWSS]. Schizophrenia Research (2011). Low credibility.

Few studies on the association between atypical antipsychotic drug (AAP) administration and metabolic dysfunction have concurrently evaluated the general population (GP), other psychotropic drug treatments, and drug-free psychiatric patients.

- **Methods**: We assessed the frequency of the metabolic syndrome (MS) according to the National Cholesterol Education Program criteria (NCEP) and its constituting variables in a GP sample (n = 271) and in patients receiving, for at least three consecutive months, antiepileptic drugs (n = 93), olanzapine (n = 162), clozapine (n = 105), typical antipsychotics (n = 117), other AAP (n = 58), other psychotropic drugs (n = 185), and drug-free individuals (n = 636). Subjects were clinically classified as schizophrenia, bipolar or other axis I disorders (DSM-IV-RT), and as first-degree relatives of each diagnostic group.

- **Results**: The MS was detected in 26.6% of the GP (95% confidence interval: 21.5–31.8). No diagnostic or treatment group had a significantly higher age-adjusted frequency than the GP (p > 0.05). Treatment duration did not significantly affect the results. However, significant differences were observed in the frequency of abnormal MS constituting variables in comparison to the GP. For example, schizophrenia patients and their relatives, bipolar subjects, and olanzapine- and clozapine-treated patients had higher abnormal waist circumference values. In addition, bipolar patients and their relatives and subjects treated with olanzapine and other AAPs had higher frequencies of abnormal glucose levels.

### Comparative effects of 18 antipsychotics on metabolic function in patients with schizophrenia, predictors of metabolic dysregulation, and association with psychopathology: A systematic review and network meta-analysis [^1177uM5e]. The Lancet Psychiatry (2020). Low credibility.

- **Methods**: We followed the PRISMA extension statement for network meta-analysis (appendix p 2). We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycINFO from inception until June 30, 2019. Our search strategy is described fully in the appendix (p 5). In brief, we used the following search terms: (antipsychotic OR [generic/branded antipsychotic names]) AND (schizo* OR psychos*) AND (random* OR 'double blind'). We included randomized, double-blind trials comparing antipsychotics licensed for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults with acute exacerbation of schizophrenia or a related disorder (schizoaffective, schizophreniform, and delusional disorders). We defined acute treatment as 6 weeks' duration. If 6-week data were not available, data closest to 6 weeks were selected. Clinical trials registry data relating to papers identified in the literature review were included.

- **Data extraction and processing**: Pairs of independent investigators screened references and extracted study-level data, with discrepancies adjudicated by TP. We extracted outcome data (expressed as mean and SD, standard error, or CIs) for change in body weight (kg), BMI (kg/m²), fasting glucose, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides (all mmol/L) from initiation to end of treatment for groups who received drugs and placebo separately. Only continuous data were collected, not binary outcomes. We did not use dose limits because of the scarce evidence that dose influences metabolic dysregulation.

### Metabolic parameters in patients treated with olanzapine or other atypical antipsychotics [^112wHF3y]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2011). Low credibility.

The relative risk of changes in metabolic parameters during treatment with atypical antipsychotics has not been fully investigated. Baseline-to-endpoint mean and anytime-categorical changes in metabolic parameters were evaluated in Lilly active comparator-controlled clinical trials.

Olanzapine-treated patients gained significantly more baseline-to-endpoint weight versus risperidone- (3.3 kg [N = 713; median exposure (ME, days) = 68] versus 1.8 kg [N = 697; ME = 65], p < 0.001), ziprasidone- (2.8 kg [N = 463; ME = 168] versus -1.3 kg [N = 443; ME = 89], p < 0.001), and aripiprazole-treated patients (3.7 kg [N = 273; ME = 104] versus 0.5 kg [N = 275; ME = 187], p < 0.001).

Significantly more olanzapine-treated patients gained ≥ 7% of their baseline weight versus risperidone- (30.6% [N = 713; ME = 169] versus 20.2% [N = 697; ME = 140], p < 0.001), ziprasidone- (30.0% [N = 463; ME = 147] versus 6.5% [N = 443; ME = 165], p < 0.001), and aripiprazole-treated patients (40.3% [N = 273; ME = 170] versus 16.4% [N = 275; ME = 154], p < 0.001).

Olanzapine-treated patients had significantly greater baseline-to-endpoint changes in fasting triglycerides compared with ziprasidone- (0.24 mmol/L [N = 365; ME = 168] versus -0.24 mmol/L [N = 316; ME = 140], p < 0.001) and aripiprazole-treated patients (0.28 mmol/L [N = 215; ME = 195] versus -0.19 mmol/L [N = 210; ME = 194], p < 0.001).

Olanzapine-treated patients had significantly greater baseline-to-endpoint changes in fasting glucose than ziprasidone- (0.25 mmol/L [N = 379; ME = 168] versus -0.04 mmol/L [N = 333; ME = 133], p = 0.016) and aripiprazole-treated patients.

### Zyprexa intramuscular [^115iDjtB]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2016). Low credibility.

In an analysis of five placebo-controlled adult olanzapine monotherapy studies with a median treatment duration of approximately three weeks, olanzapine was associated with a greater mean change in fasting glucose levels compared to placebo (2.76 mg/dL versus 0.17 mg/dL). The difference in mean changes between olanzapine and placebo was more pronounced in patients with evidence of glucose dysregulation at baseline, such as those diagnosed with diabetes mellitus or related adverse reactions, those treated with anti-diabetic agents, and patients with a baseline random glucose level ≥ 200 mg/dL and/or a baseline fasting glucose level ≥ 126 mg/dL. Olanzapine-treated patients experienced a mean increase in HbA₁c from baseline of 0.04% (median exposure 21 days), compared to a mean decrease of 0.06% in placebo-treated subjects (median exposure 17 days).

In an analysis of eight placebo-controlled studies (median treatment exposure 4–5 weeks), 6.1% of olanzapine-treated subjects (N = 855) exhibited treatment-emergent glycosuria compared to 2.8% of placebo-treated subjects (N = 599). The mean change in fasting glucose for patients exposed to olanzapine for at least 48 weeks was 4.2 mg/dL (N = 487). Analyses of patients who completed 9–12 months of olanzapine therapy indicated that mean changes in both fasting and non-fasting glucose levels continued to increase over time.

The safety and efficacy of olanzapine have not been established in patients under the age of 13 years.

Antipsychotics form the mainstay of treatment for patients with schizophrenia; however, many, especially second-generation antipsychotics, are associated with weight gain, lipid disturbance, and glucose dysregulation, thereby contributing to the development of metabolic syndrome. Approximately a third of people with schizophrenia have metabolic syndrome, with prevalence as high as 69% in those with chronic illness. The prevalence of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia in people with schizophrenia is estimated to be 3–5 times higher than in the general population. Compared with the general population, people with schizophrenia are twice as likely to have a diagnosis and die as a consequence of cardiovascular disease. The mortality gap between people with schizophrenia and the general population is growing, suggesting a need for improved understanding of the factors underlying cardiovascular disease in this group.

Although studies have previously examined changes in weight with different antipsychotics, no study has comprehensively examined antipsychotic-induced metabolic change (i.e.g.lucose, cholesterol, and triglyceride alterations) using network meta-analysis. Thus, the relative degree to which metabolic alterations occur in acute treatment with various antipsychotics is unclear. Furthermore, which physiological or demographic factors predict metabolic dysregulation associated with antipsychotics is unknown. Previous studies assessing comparative efficacies of various antipsychotics have used separate network meta-analyses to examine symptom change.

### Comparative effects of 18 antipsychotics on metabolic function in patients with schizophrenia, predictors of metabolic dysregulation, and association with psychopathology: A systematic review and network meta-analysis [^111umo3K]. The Lancet Psychiatry (2020). Low credibility.

For change in LDL cholesterol, 24 studies compared nine different antipsychotics (7439 patients) with placebo (2419 patients). Compared with placebo, we found no strong evidence of change in LDL cholesterol with ziprasidone, lurasidone, risperidone and paliperidone, aripiprazole, and brexpiprazole (figure 2). We did observe a decrease in LDL cholesterol with cariprazine (figure 2). We observed increases in LDL cholesterol with quetiapine and olanzapine (figure 2; appendix p 44). Ranking on the basis of degree of associated LDL cholesterol alteration defined cariprazine as the best and olanzapine the worst (figure 3; appendix p 48). τ was 0.03 mmol/L, considered small in the context of observed antipsychotic-associated changes. The prediction intervals did not change our conclusions when compared with CIs, and I ² was 16.2% (low). The global Q score for inconsistency was 4.46 (p = 0.92), and although we found some disagreements between direct and indirect evidence (appendix p 56), overall, we found no evidence of important heterogeneity or inconsistency in the network. Certainty of evidence was low in 19 (53%) of 36 comparisons (appendix p 73).

For change in HDL cholesterol, 22 studies compared ten different antipsychotics (7073 patients) with placebo (2189 patients). Compared with placebo, we found no strong evidence of change in HDL cholesterol observed with amisulpride, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone and paliperidone, lurasidone, cariprazine, or ziprasidone (figure 2). HDL cholesterol increased with aripiprazole and brexpiprazole (figure 2; appendix p 44).

### Effect of antipsychotics and mood stabilisers on metabolism in bipolar disorder: a network meta-analysis of randomised-controlled trials [^115EoFVJ]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). High credibility.

Additional outcomes - **Anthropometric measurements**: Antipsychotics ranked higher than mood stabilisers in elevating anthropometric measurements, including body weight, BMI, and waist circumference. Amisulpride ranked first in elevating body weight, while olanzapine ranked first in elevating BMI after eliminating sensitive comparisons. Olanzapine also ranked first in elevating waist circumference among all interventions with applicable data.

- **Serum prolactin and total serum bilirubin**: Risperidone ranked first in elevating serum prolactin, with significance noticed in comparisons of most interventions versus lumateperone. Cariprazine ranked first in elevating total serum bilirubin; however, no significance was detected among all comparisons.

Other detailed information on main and additional outcomes is summarised in Supplementary Appendix 4. The summary of mean SUCRA and mean ranking of fasting serum glucose, TC, TG, and body weight is shown in Table 1. Divalproex, asenapine, and valproic acid were absent for lack of data or sensitivity elimination. Most antipsychotics ranked higher than mood stabilisers, and all observed mood stabilisers ranked below placebo. Of note, lumateperone was the only antipsychotic ranking lower than placebo.

### Comparative effects of 18 antipsychotics on metabolic function in patients with schizophrenia, predictors of metabolic dysregulation, and association with psychopathology: A systematic review and network meta-analysis [^115T5EDC]. The Lancet Psychiatry (2020). Low credibility.

For change in BMI, 22 studies compared nine different antipsychotics (4,196 patients) with placebo (900 patients). Compared with placebo, no change in BMI was observed with haloperidol or aripiprazole. However, BMI increased with lurasidone, risperidone, paliperidone, quetiapine, sertindole, clozapine, and olanzapine (see figure 2 and appendix p. 42). Ranking on the basis of the degree of associated BMI alteration identified haloperidol as the best and olanzapine as the worst (see figure 3 and appendix p. 47). τ was 0.32 kg/m², considered moderate in the context of the observed antipsychotic-associated changes, and I² was 31.4% (low). Inspection of prediction intervals confirmed that heterogeneity was low, as for most treatment comparisons, prediction intervals and confidence intervals (CIs) led to similar conclusions. The global Q score for inconsistency was 8.93 (p = 0.54), and the back-calculation method did not provide evidence of network inconsistency (see appendix p. 53). Thus, we deemed that no evidence existed for important heterogeneity or inconsistency in this network meta-analysis. Certainty of evidence was low or very low in 18 (50%) of 36 comparisons (see appendix p. 69).

For change in total cholesterol, 36 studies compared 14 different antipsychotics (11,762 patients) with placebo (2,998 patients). Compared with placebo, we found no evidence of change in total cholesterol with iloperidone, cariprazine, sertindole, ziprasidone, lurasidone, brexpiprazole, aripiprazole, risperidone and paliperidone, haloperidol, and amisulpride. However, total cholesterol increased with quetiapine, olanzapine, and clozapine.

### Efficacy and tolerability of olanzapine, quetiapine, and risperidone in the treatment of early psychosis: A randomized, double-blind 52-week comparison [^117FvHsq]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Low credibility.

This 52-week randomized, double-blind, flexible-dose, multicenter study evaluated the overall effectiveness, as measured by treatment discontinuation rates, of olanzapine, quetiapine, and risperidone in patients early in the course of psychotic illness.

- **Method**: Patients were randomly assigned to treatment with olanzapine (2.5–20 mg/day), quetiapine (100–800 mg/day), or risperidone (0.5–4 mg/day), administered in twice-daily doses. Statistical analyses tested for noninferiority in all-cause treatment discontinuation rates up to 52 weeks (primary outcome measure) based on a prespecified noninferiority margin of 20%.

- **Results**: A total of 400 patients were randomly assigned to treatment with olanzapine (N = 133), quetiapine (N = 134), or risperidone (N = 133). The mean modal prescribed daily doses were 11.7 mg for olanzapine, 506 mg for quetiapine, and 2.4 mg for risperidone. At week 52, all-cause treatment discontinuation rates were 68.4%, 70.9%, and 71.4% for olanzapine, quetiapine, and risperidone, respectively. Reductions in total score on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) were similar for the three treatment groups, but reductions in PANSS positive subscale scores were greater in the olanzapine group (at 12 weeks and at 52 weeks or withdrawal from study) and the risperidone group (at 12 weeks). The most common elicited adverse events for olanzapine were drowsiness (53%), weight gain (51%), and insomnia (38%); for quetiapine, drowsiness (58%), increased sleep hours (42%), and weight gain (40%); and for risperidone, drowsiness (50%) and menstrual irregularities.

### Effect of antipsychotics and mood stabilisers on metabolism in bipolar disorder: A network meta-analysis of randomised-controlled trials [^113CFrHT]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Low credibility.

Among interventions with applicable data for insulin, risperidone ranked 1st, while valproic acid ranked 2nd. After a sensitive comparison of quetiapine versus placebo was eliminated, the ranking of quetiapine changed from 5th to 7th. In interventions with accessible HbA1c data, significant results were observed for lurasidone versus topiramate [SMD = 0.91 pmol/L, 95% CI = (0.06, 1.76) pmol/L], as well as quetiapine versus topiramate [SMD = 0.87 pmol/L, 95% CI = (0.01, 1.72) pmol/L]. After sensitivity checks, quetiapine ranked below placebo.

- **Total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL)**: Most antipsychotics ranked higher than placebo, while all mood stabilisers ranked below placebo in elevating TC levels. After eliminating sensitive comparisons, olanzapine ranked 1st, and significance was noticed between topiramate and zonisamide [SMD = 0.71 mmol/L, 95% CI = (0.06, 1.37) mmol/L]. Olanzapine also ranked 1st in elevating TG levels, with quetiapine ranking significantly higher than zonisamide [SMD = 1.81 mmol/L, 95% CI = (1.06, 2.55) mmol/L]. After sensitive comparisons were eliminated, the number of statistically significant comparisons decreased.

Among interventions with applicable data, only quetiapine, cariprazine, and valproic acid were more likely to reduce HDL levels compared to placebo. After sensitivity checks, lamotrigine ranked 1st, followed by olanzapine and quetiapine. Haloperidol, asenapine, and olanzapine ranked significantly higher than placebo in elevating LDL levels. After sensitivity checks, olanzapine maintained its 1st position, and more significant comparisons were observed.

### Metabolic syndrome in antipsychotic-naïve patients with first-episode psychosis: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1168ApGq]. Psychological Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

It is unclear what the prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) in drug-naïve first-episode psychosis (FEP) is, as previous meta-analyses were conducted in minimally exposed or drug-naïve FEP patients with psychotic disorder at any stage of the disease. Thus, a meta-analysis examining MetS in naïve FEP compared with the general population is needed.

- **Methods**: Studies on individuals with FEP defined as drug-naïve (0 days exposure to antipsychotics) were included to conduct a systematic review. A meta-analysis of proportions for the prevalence of MetS in antipsychotic-naïve patients was performed. Prevalence estimates and 95% CI were calculated using a random-effect model. Subgroup analyses and meta-regressions to identify sources and the amount of heterogeneity were also conducted.

- **Results**: The search yielded 4,143 articles. After the removal of duplicates, 2,473 abstracts and titles were screened. At the full-text stage, 112 were screened; 18 articles were included in a systematic review and 13 articles in the main statistical analysis. The prevalence of MetS in naïve (0 days) FEP is 13.2% (95% CI 8.7–19.0). Ethnicity accounted for 3% of the heterogeneity between studies, and the diagnostic criteria used for MetS accounted for 7%. When compared with controls matched by sex and age, the odds ratio is 2.52 (95% CI 1.29–5.07; p = 0.007).

- **Conclusions**: Our findings of increased rates of MetS in naïve FEP patients suggest that we are underestimating cardiovascular risk in this population, especially in those of non-Caucasian origin. Our findings support that altered metabolic profiles in these patients may require targeted interventions.

### Effects of long-term antipsychotics treatment on body weight: A population-based cohort study [^1161WBy2]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2020). Low credibility.

Baseline characteristics of patients from olanzapine, quetiapine, and risperidone cohorts were stratified by sex. From height onwards, some continuous variables changed their scale as labeled below their names. In both the short term (< 6 weeks) and long term (⩾ 6 weeks to ≤ 4 years), individuals treated with any of the three antipsychotic (AP) drugs gained weight, especially those prescribed olanzapine. Pre-treatment weight change was negligible for the quetiapine (women and men) and risperidone (men only) cohorts, and slightly negative for the rest.

In the short term after olanzapine initiation, men's weight increased by 0.569 kg per week (3.4 kg over the first six weeks) and women's weight increased by 0.382 kg per week (2.3 kg over the first six weeks). Individuals initiated on quetiapine and risperidone also gained weight shortly after the initiation of treatment, but to a lesser extent.

- **Long-term effects**: Individuals continued to gain weight after six weeks, but at a slower rate than during the first six weeks. For example, for women initiated on olanzapine, long-term weight gain was estimated to be 0.014 kg per week (0.7 kg per year). Women who were initiated on olanzapine were generally slightly lighter (69.7 kg) than women initiated on risperidone (73.3 kg) and quetiapine (70.1 kg), but there was not much difference for the men.

Women who had a lower weight before initiation of olanzapine gained more weight in the short term than women who had a higher weight.

### Zyprexa intramuscular [^117E6vNT]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2016). Low credibility.

Olanzapine is well absorbed and reaches peak concentrations approximately 6 hours following an oral dose. It is extensively eliminated by first-pass metabolism, with approximately 40% of the dose metabolized before reaching the systemic circulation. Food does not affect the rate or extent of olanzapine absorption. Pharmacokinetic studies showed that Zyprexa tablets and Zyprexa Zydis (olanzapine orally disintegrating tablets) dosage forms of olanzapine are bioequivalent.

- **Oral administration, monotherapy**: Olanzapine displays linear kinetics over the clinical dosing range. Its half-life ranges from 21 to 54 hours (5th to 95th percentile; mean of 30 hrs), and apparent plasma clearance ranges from 12 to 47 L/hr (5th to 95th percentile; mean of 25 L/hr). Administration of olanzapine once daily leads to steady-state concentrations in about 1 week, achieving approximately twice the concentrations after single doses. Plasma concentrations, half-life, and clearance of olanzapine may vary between individuals based on smoking status, gender, and age.

Olanzapine is extensively distributed throughout the body, with a volume of distribution of approximately 1000 L. It is 93% bound to plasma proteins over the concentration range of 7 to 1100 ng/mL, binding primarily to albumin and α-acid glycoprotein.

Following a single oral dose of C-labeled olanzapine, 7% of the dose was recovered in the urine as unchanged drug, indicating that olanzapine is highly metabolized. Approximately 57% and 30% of the dose were recovered in the urine and feces, respectively.

### Metabolic considerations in the use of antipsychotic medications: a review of recent evidence [^116ADRWj]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2007). Low credibility.

Compared with the general population, persons with schizophrenia have up to a 20% shorter lifespan, with cardiovascular disease as the leading cause of death. In addition, persons with schizophrenia have an increased prevalence of metabolic syndrome (obesity, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, impaired glucose tolerance, and hypertension), increased prevalence of risk factors such as smoking, poverty, and poor nutrition, and reduced access to medical care.

Results from the recent Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness (CATIE) provide further evidence of the metabolic risk associated with different atypical antipsychotics. Based on this study and a growing number of other randomized clinical trials, clozapine and olanzapine treatment can produce substantial mean changes in weight and an increased risk of associated metabolic disturbances. Risperidone and quetiapine treatment can produce intermediate changes in mean weight compared to treatment with other atypical antipsychotics, with discrepant results concerning metabolic risk. Aripiprazole and ziprasidone treatment induced the lowest mean changes in weight gain and had no effect on the risk for adverse metabolic changes among currently available atypical agents.

Considerable evidence indicates that mentally ill patients often do not receive adequate recognition, monitoring, or care for their medical illnesses. There is a critical need for psychiatrists and primary care professionals to increase awareness of and attention to the physical health problems of persons with mental illness.

### Comparison of longer-term safety and effectiveness of 4 atypical antipsychotics in patients over age 40: a trial using equipoise-stratified randomization [^1176NxVF]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

To compare the longer-term safety and effectiveness of the 4 most commonly used atypical antipsychotics — aripiprazole, olanzapine, quetiapine, and risperidone — in 332 patients aged over 40, having psychosis associated with schizophrenia, mood disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder, or dementia diagnosed using DSM-IV-TR criteria, we conducted a study using equipoise-stratified randomization. This method, a hybrid of complete randomization and clinician's choice methods, allowed patients or their treating psychiatrists to exclude 1 or 2 of the study atypical antipsychotics due to past experience or anticipated risk.

Patients were followed for up to 2 years, with assessments at baseline, 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and every 12 weeks thereafter. Medications were administered employing open-label design and flexible dosages, but with blind raters. The study was conducted from October 2005 to October 2010.

- **Outcome measures**: Primary metabolic markers (body mass index, blood pressure, fasting blood glucose, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides), percentage of patients who stay on the randomly assigned atypical antipsychotic for at least 6 months, psychopathology, percentage of patients who develop metabolic syndrome, and percentage of patients who develop serious and nonserious adverse events.

- **Results**: Because of a high incidence of serious adverse events, quetiapine was discontinued midway through the trial. There were significant differences among patients willing to be randomized to different atypical antipsychotics (P < .01), suggesting significant variability in outcomes.

### Managing weight gain and metabolic issues in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics [^117WXyyf]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

The proven efficacy of second-generation antipsychotics (SGA) has led many clinicians to switch patients from a conventional antipsychotic to an SGA. However, SGAs may be associated with weight gain, dyslipidemia, high blood pressure, and ultimately with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. Clinicians should be aware of patients' individual risk factors for developing these illnesses and should carefully screen for changes in weight, body mass index, waist size, or lipid levels that could be potentially harmful and increase the risk for a more serious illness.

### Longitudinal impact of different treatment sequences of second-generation antipsychotics on metabolic outcomes: a study using targeted maximum likelihood estimation [^114scYRw]. Psychological Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Metabolic outcomes at 12 months with different durations of SGA treatment were evaluated. We compared groups taking SGAs for varying durations (3, 6, 9, and 12 months) against those with no treatment throughout the study.

- **Average treatment effect (ATE)**: Examined by comparing different times of SGA discontinuation with never treated individuals.
	- The interval between each time point was 3 months.
	- **Treatment was defined as taking any of these seven SGAs**: clozapine, olanzapine, amisulpride, paliperidone, risperidone, quetiapine, or lurasidone.
	- **Time-varying confounders included four drugs**: metformin, atorvastatin, simvastatin, or valproate.
	- Treatment was coded as 1 if the patient took SGAs at the observed time point and 0 otherwise. For example, abar_1_0_0_0 indicates SGA treatment at the 1st time-point (3rd month) but not afterward.
	- **Abbreviations**: TC, total cholesterol; HDL, high-density lipoprotein; LDL, low-density lipoprotein; FG, fasting blood glucose level; BMI, body mass index.

Our findings suggested lingering side effects of SGA treatment on BMI. Regardless of the treatment duration, BMI remained significantly higher at 12 months compared to no treatment, even after SGA discontinuation. However, this effect was not evident for other metabolic outcomes, where effect sizes were non-significant if the drug had been discontinued for at least 3 months before the final assessment.

### Metabolic effects of second-generation antipsychotics in bipolar youth: Comparison with other psychotic and nonpsychotic diagnoses [^114vdgTw]. Bipolar Disorders (2010). Low credibility.

Despite the known metabolic effects of second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) on children and adolescents, comparative effects in youth with different diagnoses remain underreported. We compared the differences in metabolic changes three months after starting treatment with SGAs in youth with bipolar disorder and with other psychotic and nonpsychotic disorders.

- **Methods**: Weight and metabolic differences among diagnostic groups before and three months after starting treatment with SGAs were compared in a naturalistic cohort of children and adolescents (14.9 ± 3.0 years). They were diagnosed with bipolar disorder (n = 31), other psychotic disorders (n = 29), and other nonpsychotic disorders (n = 30), with no (35.6%) or very little (6.6 ± 9.0 days) previous exposure to antipsychotics. Composite measurements of significant weight gain [weight increase ≥ 5% at three months, or increase ≥ 0.5 in body mass index (BMI) z-score] and 'risk for adverse health outcome' (≥ 95th BMI percentile, or ≥ 85th BMI percentile plus presence of one other obesity-related complication) were included. SGAs (risperidone, olanzapine, and quetiapine) were prescribed in comparable proportions among groups.

- **Results**: Baseline weight and metabolic indices were not significantly different among diagnoses. Three months after starting treatment with SGAs, more than 70% of patients had significant weight gain, BMI z-score increased in all diagnostic groups (p < 0.001 for all comparisons), and total cholesterol increased in the bipolar (p = 0.02) and psychotic (p = 0.01) disorder groups.

### Comparative effects of 18 antipsychotics on metabolic function in patients with schizophrenia, predictors of metabolic dysregulation, and association with psychopathology: A systematic review and network meta-analysis [^112eAUa6]. The Lancet Psychiatry (2020). Low credibility.

We found that antipsychotics vary markedly in their effects on body weight, BMI, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and glucose concentrations. As expected, clozapine and olanzapine are, across virtually all parameters, associated with the largest degree of metabolic dysregulation. However, for several antipsychotics, we did not find evidence of an effect versus placebo in terms of lipid or glucose measures. Interestingly, some of the drugs were shown to perform better than placebo on some metabolic measures: for instance, when compared with placebo, lurasidone led to reductions in glucose, cariprazine to reductions in LDL cholesterol, and aripiprazole and brexpiprazole to increases in HDL cholesterol.

Our meta-analysis is the first to examine predictors of antipsychotic-induced metabolic change. We found that increased baseline bodyweight, male sex, and non-white ethnicity predict greater vulnerability to antipsychotic-induced metabolic dysregulation, suggesting an overlap between risk factors for metabolic disease in the general population and in people with antipsychotic-induced metabolic disease. We did not observe a relationship between baseline weight and the magnitude of antipsychotic-induced weight gain, as observed in some but not all previous studies. The discrepancies between our results and some of those previously documented might be a consequence of the large sample size used in our study and the restriction of our analyses to randomized controlled trials of acute treatment, with previous studies examining weight gain over longer periods.

### Cardiovascular risk factors and metabolic syndrome in people with established psychotic illnesses: Baseline data from the IMPaCT randomized controlled trial [^111ZBCCe]. Psychological Medicine (2015). High credibility.

Clustering of cardiometabolic risk factors is termed the metabolic syndrome (MetS). Individuals with the MetS have a 3- to 6-fold increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus and a 2- to 6-fold risk of mortality due to cardiovascular disease (CVD). On meta-analysis, a third of patients with schizophrenia have the MetS, with this proportion increasing with the duration of illness. Slightly higher MetS rates of 34% are seen in multi-episode patients, while the deficit syndrome (i.e. negative symptoms of psychosis that are present as enduring traits) in schizophrenia is in itself associated with higher CVD risk. Similar rates of the MetS have been observed in bipolar disorder (37%) and schizo-affective disorder (27–42%), although recently the Second Australian National Survey of Psychosis reported higher rates of 61% in those with psychotic disorders, suggesting an increasing prevalence with time.

It is possible to prevent the emergence of CVD risk in psychosis with the use of psychosocial interventions in the short term, though this is not sustained once the intervention is discontinued. Strategies do exist to manage established cardiometabolic risk factors, but despite this, a recent UK national audit reported screening rates for metabolic side effects of antipsychotic medication of only 11%.

### Glucose metabolism in patients with schizophrenia treated with olanzapine or quetiapine: A frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test and minimal model analysis [^114g5rtC]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2006). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to compare matched olanzapine- and quetiapine-treated schizophrenia patients and normal controls on measures of glucose metabolism. Clozapine and olanzapine treatment has been associated with insulin resistance in non-obese schizophrenia patients. Much less is known regarding other agents such as quetiapine.

A cross-sectional comparison was conducted using a frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test and nutritional assessment from April 2002 to October 2004. The study involved quetiapine-treated and olanzapine-treated non-obese schizophrenia subjects (DSM-IV) with a body mass index < 30.0 kg/m², matched with normal controls. Data from 24 subjects were included in the analysis (7 quetiapine, 8 olanzapine, 9 normal controls).

The results indicated a significant difference among groups for fasting baseline plasma glucose concentrations (p = .02), with olanzapine-treated individuals having higher levels than normal controls (p = .01). The insulin sensitivity index (SI) differed significantly among groups (p = .039); olanzapine subjects exhibited significant insulin resistance compared to normal controls (p = .01). However, there was no significant difference when comparing quetiapine to olanzapine (p = .1) or quetiapine to normal controls (p = .40). In quetiapine-treated subjects, SI inversely correlated with quetiapine dose (p = .0001) and waist circumference (p = .03). Insulin resistance calculated via the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) also showed significant differences among groups (p = .03), with the olanzapine group having a higher HOMA-IR level than normal controls.
