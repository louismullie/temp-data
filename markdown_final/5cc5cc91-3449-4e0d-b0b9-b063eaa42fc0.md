## Question

Warfarin dosing to prevent acute gout flares

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about warfarin dosing to prevent acute gout flares. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether warfarin has any approved or evidence-based role in gout flare prophylaxis. Then, I should verify what current gout guidelines recommend for flare prevention. Next, I will check the provided references to ensure there is no overlooked evidence for anticoagulation in gout. After that, I will outline the correct, evidence-based prophylactic options with dosing and duration. Finally, I need to consider special situations such as renal impairment, drug interactions, and comorbid anticoagulation, and then deliver a clear conclusion and recommendation.

> Let me first confirm the indication for warfarin. Warfarin is a vitamin K antagonist indicated for thromboembolic prophylaxis and treatment; it has no anti-inflammatory effect on the NLRP3 inflammasome–driven pathophysiology of gout and is not a urate-lowering agent, so I should be cautious not to conflate anticoagulation with gout flare prevention; wait, let me verify whether any gout guideline even mentions anticoagulants for prophylaxis — none do, and all authoritative guidelines restrict prophylaxis to anti-inflammatory options like colchicine, NSAIDs, or corticosteroids when initiating urate-lowering therapy, with no role for warfarin [^114XNW5a] [^112D3qBA] [^117QyWfG].

> I need to check the provided documents systematically for any mention of warfarin or anticoagulation in gout management; hold on, I should verify terms across ACR, EULAR, BSR, ACP, FDA labels, and reviews — there is zero mention of warfarin for gout flare prevention in these sources, and the recommended strategies are consistent: use anti-inflammatory prophylaxis when starting or intensifying urate-lowering therapy, not anticoagulants [^114XNW5a] [^112D3qBA] [^113GgTZp].

> Next, I will now examine what evidence-based flare prophylaxis actually entails so I can provide correct dosing. Strong guidelines recommend colchicine 0.6 mg once or twice daily (0.5–0.6 mg) or low-dose NSAIDs (e.g., naproxen 250 mg twice daily) for at least 3–6 months when initiating urate-lowering therapy; if these are contraindicated or not tolerated, low-dose corticosteroids can be used as an alternative, and IL-1 inhibitors are reserved for refractory or contraindicated cases; I should double-check FDA labeling for colchicine dosing to ensure alignment, which confirms 0.6 mg once or twice daily with a maximum of 1.2 mg/day [^114XNW5a] [^113UXfU7] [^1121p1mK].

> Hold on, I should verify renal dosing and drug-interaction caveats for colchicine because this often alters prophylaxis. EULAR advises colchicine 0.5–1 mg/day reduced in renal impairment and to avoid co-prescription with strong P-gp/CYP3A4 inhibitors; the FDA label specifies prophylaxis starting at 0.3 mg/day in severe renal impairment and 0.3 mg twice weekly in dialysis, with careful monitoring; yes, that aligns, so renal function and interacting drugs must be reviewed before selecting colchicine [^112D3qBA] [^114WSd67] [^115yiPmM].

> Let me consider alternatives when colchicine is unsuitable. Low-dose NSAIDs (e.g., naproxen 250 mg twice daily) are guideline-supported for prophylaxis, with gastroprotection as appropriate; if NSAIDs and colchicine are contraindicated, low-dose prednisone/prednisolone can be used; for patients in whom standard anti-inflammatories are contraindicated or not tolerated, IL-1 blockade can be considered for flares and, in select contexts, for prophylaxis in refractory cases — though routine prophylactic IL-1 use is not standard and access varies; I need to ensure dosing examples are consistent: naproxen 250 mg twice daily is supported for prophylaxis in reviews, and BSR advises gastroprotection with NSAIDs [^113UXfU7] [^112iwfhS] [^116TNCvZ].

> I should confirm duration and linkage to urate-lowering therapy because this determines how long to continue prophylaxis. ACR recommends continuing prophylaxis for at least 3–6 months and longer if flares persist, within a treat-to-target approach to achieve serum urate less than 6 mg/dL with low-dose initiation and titration of allopurinol (preferred first-line) or febuxostat; importantly, stopping prophylaxis can transiently increase flare risk, so timing matters; let me verify post-prophylaxis flare data — meta-analysis shows higher flare rates in the three months after stopping prophylaxis, which reinforces careful continuation and taper strategy during ULT stabilization [^113GgTZp] [^11323pWu] [^114D7JUb].

> But wait, what if the original query stems from a comorbidity scenario where the patient is already on warfarin for atrial fibrillation or venous thromboembolism? I need to ensure the anti-inflammatory choice accounts for bleeding risk; NSAIDs increase gastrointestinal bleeding risk and would need caution and gastroprotection if used at all, so colchicine or corticosteroids (including intra-articular for monoarthritis) are often safer selections in anticoagulated patients; the BSR recommendation to co-prescribe gastroprotection with NSAIDs underscores this, and guidelines emphasize tailoring anti-inflammatory choice to comorbidities; I should confirm intra-articular or parenteral steroid options remain endorsed for certain settings, which ACR supports, especially when NPO or where local therapy is appropriate [^112iwfhS] [^116zBWTg] [^1137Cqjh].

> Hmm, wait a minute — could there be any theoretical rationale for warfarin to reduce gout flares? I initially wondered about indirect effects on inflammation or urate handling, but I should verify; no guideline, label, or trial data support such a mechanism, and prescribing warfarin for gout prophylaxis would expose patients to bleeding without urate-lowering or anti-inflammatory benefit; the consistent absence of anticoagulants from all gout management pathways is itself informative and argues strongly against this practice [^114XNW5a] [^112ZXcoP] [^113gR76y].

> Final answer and clinical recommendation: I need to be explicit — there is no role for warfarin in preventing acute gout flares, and no dosing for this indication exists. Appropriate prophylaxis when initiating or intensifying urate-lowering therapy is low-dose colchicine 0.6 mg once or twice daily (max 1.2 mg/day), with renal adjustment and interaction checks as needed; alternatively, low-dose NSAIDs with gastroprotection or low-dose corticosteroids can be used based on comorbidities and tolerability, and consider IL-1 inhibitors only in refractory or contraindicated scenarios; continue prophylaxis for at least 3–6 months and longer if flares persist, within a treat-to-target urate-lowering strategy aiming for serum urate less than 6 mg/dL [^1121p1mK] [^114XNW5a] [^113GgTZp].

There is **no evidence** that warfarin prevents acute gout flares, and it is not recommended for gout flare prevention [^notfound]. Warfarin does not lower uric acid or reduce inflammation, and its use **increases bleeding risk**, especially when combined with NSAIDs or colchicine. For gout flare prevention, **use urate-lowering therapy** with anti-inflammatory prophylaxis (colchicine, NSAIDs, or corticosteroids) per guidelines [^114XNW5a] [^113GgTZp]. If a patient on warfarin requires gout-flare prophylaxis, monitor the INR closely and adjust doses to minimize bleeding risk.

---

## Pharmacological rationale and evidence

Warfarin inhibits vitamin K–dependent clotting factors but has **no urate-lowering or anti-inflammatory effects**, so it does not prevent gout flares. No **clinical evidence or guideline** supports its use for flare prevention [^1137Cqjh].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines from ACR, EULAR, and BSR do **not recommend** warfarin for gout-flare prevention [^112ZXcoP] [^117QyWfG]. Instead, they endorse **urate-lowering therapy (ULT)** with allopurinol or febuxostat to maintain serum urate < 6 mg/dL [^114XNW5a] [^11323pWu] and **anti-inflammatory prophylaxis** with colchicine, NSAIDs, or corticosteroids during ULT initiation to prevent flares [^114XNW5a] [^113mx3QG]. Warfarin is **not mentioned** as a prophylactic option in these guidelines.

---

## Risks and adverse effects

In patients with gout, warfarin carries **significant risks**:

- **Bleeding risk**: Increased risk of bleeding, especially with NSAIDs or colchicine.

- **Drug interactions**: Interacts with many gout medications, complicating management.

- **No benefit**: Does not reduce gout flares or inflammation.

---

## Alternative pharmacological strategies

Effective alternatives to prevent **acute gout flares** include [^113GgTZp]:

| **Medication** | **Mechanism of action** | **Recommended dosage** | **Clinical considerations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Colchicine | Anti-inflammatory | 0.6 mg once or twice daily | - Adjust dose in renal impairment <br/> - Monitor for GI side effects [^115yiPmM] |
| NSAIDs | Anti-inflammatory | Naproxen 250 mg BID | - Contraindicated in severe renal impairment <br/> - Monitor GI and CV risks [^113UXfU7] |
| Corticosteroids | Anti-inflammatory | Prednisone 30–35 mg/day for 3–5 days | Useful when NSAIDs/colchicine contraindicated [^1139UKZq] |
| IL-1 inhibitors | Anti-inflammatory | Anakinra and canakinumab | For refractory cases or contraindications to standard therapy [^112ZXcoP] |

---

## Patient-specific considerations

When selecting **prophylactic therapy**, consider:

- **Renal function**: Adjust colchicine dose; avoid NSAIDs in severe renal impairment [^113a5V3x] [^112D3qBA] [^114WSd67].

- **Comorbidities**: Tailor therapy to cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and metabolic conditions [^112iwfhS].

- **Drug interactions**: Carefully manage interactions, especially with anticoagulants [^1121p1mK].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular **monitoring** is essential for ongoing care [^111dWSet]:

- **Serum urate levels**: Maintain < 6 mg/dL [^114XNW5a] [^1147sG2n].

- **Renal function**: Monitor regularly, especially with colchicine or NSAIDs [^113a5V3x] [^115yiPmM].

- **Adverse effects**: Monitor for GI, cardiovascular, and hematologic side effects [^112fhVor] [^111RCkTS].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Warfarin is **not effective** for preventing acute gout flares and is **not recommended**. Use **urate-lowering therapy** with **anti-inflammatory prophylaxis** per guidelines, tailored to patient-specific factors [^114XNW5a].

To provide guidance for the management of gout, including indications for and optimal use of urate-lowering therapy (ULT), treatment of gout flares, and lifestyle and other medication recommendations.

- **Methods**: Fifty-seven population, intervention, comparator, and outcomes questions were developed, followed by a systematic literature review, including network meta-analyses with ratings of the available evidence according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology, and patient input. A group consensus process was used to compose the final recommendations and grade their strength as strong or conditional.

- **Results**: Forty-two recommendations (including 16 strong recommendations) were generated. Strong recommendations included initiation of ULT for all patients with tophaceous gout, radiographic damage due to gout, or frequent gout flares; allopurinol as the preferred first-line ULT, including for those with moderate-to-severe chronic kidney disease (CKD; stage > 3); using a low starting dose of allopurinol (≤ 100 mg/day, and lower in CKD) or febuxostat (< 40 mg/day); and a treat-to-target management strategy with ULT dose titration guided by serial serum urate (SU) measurements, with an SU target of < 6 mg/dl. When initiating ULT, concomitant antiinflammatory prophylaxis therapy for a duration of at least 3–6 months was strongly recommended. For management of gout flares, colchicine, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, or glucocorticoids (oral, intraarticular, or intramuscular) were strongly recommended.

### Impact of comorbidities on gout and hyperuricaemia: an update on prevalence and treatment options [^116xUkZR]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Comorbidities can imply contraindication for drugs usually prescribed for the management of acute flares in gout. Colchicine and NSAIDs should not be used for patients with renal failure, who are usually given intra-articular or systemic steroids. Furthermore, in cases of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus, steroids can be poorly tolerated, especially when repeated courses are needed for patients with frequent flares. Following the observation that interleukin 1 (IL-1) plays a major role in MSU crystal-triggered inflammation, IL-1 blockers have been proposed for the management of flares in patients with difficult-to-treat disease. Open studies of the IL-1 receptor antagonist anakinra support its off-label use for patients resistant to, or with contraindications to, NSAIDs, colchicine, and steroids. Canakinumab, a long-lasting antibody to IL-1β, has been approved by the European Medical Agency (but not the US Food and Drug Administration) following two RCTs comparing it to intramuscular triamcinolone acetonide. The EULAR has recommended considering IL-1 blockers for the management of gout flares in patients with frequent flares and a contraindication to NSAIDs, colchicine, and steroids (oral or injectable). Infection is a contraindication.

According to the EULAR and American College of Rheumatology (ACR) recommendations, small doses of colchicine should be used during the first six months of ULD therapy to decrease the risk of ULD flares. Colchicine exposure has been found to be up to two-fold higher in people with renal impairment.

### Management of acute and recurrent gout: A clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians [^116D1smR]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

The American College of Physicians (ACP) developed this guideline to present the evidence and provide clinical recommendations on the management of gout.

- **Methods**: Using the ACP grading system, the committee based these recommendations on a systematic review of randomized controlled trials, systematic reviews, and large observational studies published between January 2010 and March 2016. Clinical outcomes evaluated included pain, joint swelling and tenderness, activities of daily living, patient global assessment, recurrence, intermediate outcomes of serum urate levels, and harms.

- **Target audience and patient population**: The target audience for this guideline includes all clinicians, and the target patient population includes adults with acute or recurrent gout.

- **Recommendation 1**: ACP recommends that clinicians choose corticosteroids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), or colchicine to treat patients with acute gout (Grade: strong recommendation, high-quality evidence).

- **Recommendation 2**: ACP recommends that clinicians use low-dose colchicine when using colchicine to treat acute gout (Grade: strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

- **Recommendation 3**: ACP recommends against initiating long-term urate-lowering therapy in most patients following a first gout attack or in patients with infrequent attacks (Grade: strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

- **Recommendation 4**: ACP recommends that clinicians discuss benefits, harms, costs, and individual preferences with patients before initiating urate-lowering therapy, including concomitant medications.

### A randomized, double-blind, active- and placebo-controlled efficacy and safety study of arhalofenate for reducing flare in patients with gout [^116bm5vp]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2016). Low credibility.

Study drugs were administered once daily for 12 weeks. There were five treatment groups: 600 mg arhalofenate, 800 mg arhalofenate, 300 mg allopurinol, 300 mg allopurinol plus 0.6 mg colchicine, and placebo. Eligible patients were randomly assigned at a 2:2:2:2:1 ratio to the five treatment groups; the placebo group had half the number of patients in the other groups.

- **Study assessments**: Each patient was provided with a handheld electronic diary to be used once a day to report flare episodes. Patients were trained during screening by certified study site personnel. The diary first asked patients if they had joint pain, if this pain was typical of a flare, and whether it was present at rest. If pain was present, the patient was asked additional questions about the nature of this potential gout attack and its treatment. Beginning with the first dose of study drug and for the 12 weeks of the study, the patient reported flares via the electronic diary. Electronic diary data were reviewed with site personnel at weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12. Site personnel also checked patients' compliance with the electronic diary in an ongoing manner. The electronic diary was also used to fill out a patient's quality‐of‐life questionnaire (the Health Assessment Questionnaire II).

- **Safety assessments**: These included a complete physical examination, 12‐lead EKG, evaluation of vital signs, and height and weight. Laboratory tests included standard chemistry and hematology panels, estimated creatinine clearance, and the fractional excretion of uric acid.

### Implementing treat-to-target urate-lowering therapy during hospitalizations for gout flares [^1115jBQQ]. Rheumatology (2024). Low credibility.

All data used in these analyses were routinely captured during clinical care. In-hospital data were extracted from electronic patient records. Post-discharge data were extracted from local care records, containing primary and secondary care data for patients with linked NHS identifiers who had not opted out of this service. All data were manually validated by a rheumatologist and pseudonymized for analysis purposes. Outcomes were selected a priori with stakeholder input.

- **Baseline characteristics**: Baseline data were collected as follows: age; sex; admission type (ED attendance-only vs. hospital admission); day/time of presentation (defined as out-of-hours if occurring between 9 p.m. and 9 a.m. or on a Saturday/Sunday); pre-existing gout diagnosis; pre-existing prescription for ULT (allopurinol, febuxostat, benzbromarone, sulfinpyrazone, or probenecid); and baseline blood tests, if performed during the presentation (serum urate, CRP, white cell count, neutrophil count, lymphocyte count, and serum creatinine).

- **Outcomes during hospitalization**: Data were captured to ascertain whether the following outcomes occurred during the hospitalization episode: rheumatology input sought; serum urate level performed; joint aspiration performed; flare treatment(s) prescribed (NSAID, colchicine, and/or oral, intramuscular, intravenous, or intra-articular corticosteroids); disease education provided to patients; ULT initiated (if patient not already receiving ULT) or up-titrated (if patient already receiving ULT at a sub-optimal dose); prophylaxis prescribed (low-dose colchicine).

### Orthopaedic management of gout [^113AVMrk]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global Research & Reviews (2022). Low credibility.

The goal of medical treatment of gout is to acutely control inflammation from flares and chronically lower uric acid levels. Gout flares are usually treated with NSAIDs (naproxen, indomethacin, or selective cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitors), colchicine, and oral or intra-articular corticosteroids, either individually or in combination. Patients whose gout flares are refractory to these traditional treatments or have medical contraindications may be considered for monoclonal antibodies against IL-1 or adrenocorticotropic hormone. The first-line treatment for lowering uric acid is with xanthine oxidase inhibitors, which stop the synthesis of uric acid from hypoxanthine and include allopurinol and febuxostat. Next, consideration is given to medications that promote uric acid excretion (uricosuric) such as probenecid and those that promote uric acid degradation such as pegloticase, an intravenously administered recombinant uricase.

Newer therapeutics include arhalofenate, which has been shown to have both uricosuric and anti-inflammatory effects in clinical trials, and oral recombinant uricases. Finally, lifestyle modifications such as weight loss and limiting the intake of purine-rich foods should also be recommended in addition to medications for decreasing inflammation and uric acid levels.

- **Surgical treatment**: Surgical treatment for gout is generally reserved for cases of damage to the surrounding soft tissue or concomitant septic arthritis.

### Krystexxa [^111x1pLj]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

In a 52-week, randomized, double-blind trial, the efficacy of KRYSTEXXA co-administered with methotrexate was evaluated against KRYSTEXXA alone. Patients received gout flare prophylaxis similar to that used in pre-marketing, placebo-controlled trials. For the first 3 months, the percentages of patients experiencing any flare were 66% in the group treated with KRYSTEXXA co-administered with methotrexate and 69% in the group treated with KRYSTEXXA alone. Over subsequent 3-month increments, the group treated with KRYSTEXXA and methotrexate saw flare percentages of 27% during Month 6, 8% during Month 9, and 9% during Month 12. In contrast, the group treated with KRYSTEXXA alone experienced flare percentages of 14% during Month 6, 9% during Month 9, and 21% during Month 12.

During pre-marketing 24-week controlled clinical trials with KRYSTEXXA alone, the frequencies of gout flares were noted to be high across all treatment groups, particularly during the first 3 months. Over the subsequent 3 months, these frequencies decreased. Specifically, the percentages of patients experiencing flares in the first 3 months were 74% for KRYSTEXXA 8 mg every 2 weeks, 81% for KRYSTEXXA 8 mg every 4 weeks, and 51% for placebo. For the subsequent 3 months, flare percentages were 41% for KRYSTEXXA 8 mg every 2 weeks, 57% for KRYSTEXXA 8 mg every 4 weeks, and 67% for placebo. Patients received prophylaxis for gout flares with colchicine and/or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

### Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for treatment of acute gout [^112fhVor]. JAMA (2015). Low credibility.

- **Clinical question**: Are nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) associated with better outcomes than cyclooxygenase inhibitors, glucocorticoids, IL-1 inhibitors, or placebo in the treatment of acute gout?

- **Bottom line**: NSAIDs are not significantly associated with a difference in pain reduction compared with cyclooxygenase inhibitors and glucocorticoids for treating acute gout. However, NSAIDs are associated with higher rates of adverse events and higher rates of withdrawal due to adverse events compared with cyclooxygenase inhibitors.

### Global, regional, and national burden of gout, 1990–2020, and projections to 2050: A systematic analysis of the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021 [^1147sG2n]. The Lancet Rheumatology (2024). High credibility.

Although non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications are beneficial in the treatment of acute gout flares, ongoing prevention of recurring gout can be achieved by lowering uric acid through the use of urate lowering therapy, in addition to low-dose anti-inflammatory medications. There is evidence to support a treat-to-target approach for lowering serum urate, which can suppress gout flares and prevent joint and other end organ damage in the long term by reducing the total body load of urate tissue deposits.

However, it has been reported that suboptimal treatment of gout occurs in many countries, with only a third to half of patients with gout receiving urate-lowering therapy, and fewer than half of patients adhering to the long-term treatment needed. Suboptimal treatment might lead to the unnecessary development of disabling erosive gout. One of the most important strategies to reduce the ongoing burden of gout is improving education around adherence to treatment. The ability to do this is likely to vary across regions and might contribute to the differences seen across regions.

Our forecasts showed that the prevalence of gout is estimated to be up to 96 million in 2050. Unfortunately, these forecasts cannot yet be based on projected rates of risk factors, including high BMI and kidney dysfunction, and the Socio-Demographic Index (SDI) has been taken as a proxy in the forecasting process. It is known that global rates of overweight and obesity are increasing, so the actual forecasted prevalence rate could be higher if the increase in obesity is greater than the increase in SDI.

### The British Society for Rheumatology guideline for the management of gout [^113gR76y]. Rheumatology (2017). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of gout, specifically the management of acute flares, the BSR 2017 guidelines recommend considering the administration of IL-1 inhibitors, such as canakinumab, rilonacept, or anakinra, for patients who have not responded adequately to the standard treatment of acute gout.

### The British Society for Rheumatology guideline for the management of gout [^116eZv8m]. Rheumatology (2017). High credibility.

The BSR 2017 guidelines recommend considering joint aspiration and the administration of an intra-articular corticosteroid for managing patients with acute monoarticular gout. In patients unable to tolerate NSAIDs or colchicine, or if intra-articular injection is not feasible, a short course of oral corticosteroids or a single intramuscular corticosteroid injection should be considered as an alternative. Systemic therapy is also recommended for patients experiencing oligo- or polyarticular attacks of gout.

### Gout [^113W4e2F]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2011). Low credibility.

Gout affects about 5% of men and 1% of women, with up to 80% of people experiencing a recurrent attack within 3 years. We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatments for acute gout? What are the effects of treatments to prevent gout in people with prior acute episodes?

We searched Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to September 2010. Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review. We included harms alerts from relevant organizations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

We found 16 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: colchicine, corticosteroids, corticotropin (ACTH), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), sulfinpyrazone, xanthine oxidase inhibitors, advice to lose weight, advice to reduce alcohol intake, and advice to reduce dietary intake of purines.

### Improving outcomes for patients hospitalized with gout: a systematic review [^116ZEH7Y]. Rheumatology (2021). High credibility.

Gout is characterized by recurrent flares of joint pain and swelling, which can necessitate hospital admission when severe. Highly effective, low-cost medications are available for the treatment of gout flares: colchicine, NSAIDs, and corticosteroids. Flares can be prevented by urate-lowering therapies (ULTs), of which allopurinol is the most widely used. The British Society for Rheumatology (BSR) and EULAR guidelines recommend offering ULT to all patients with gout, with up-titration to achieve serum urate (SU) levels of 300–360 micromol/l (5–6 mg/dl), to facilitate crystal dissolution. The ACR gout management guideline was recently updated to conditionally recommend initiation of ULT during flares, rather than delayed initiation of ULT after flare resolution.

Despite effective treatments, hospitalizations for gout flares have increased dramatically: doubling in the United States between 1993 and 2011, from 4.4 to 8.8 admissions per 100,000 adults, respectively; doubling in Canada between 2000 and 2011, from 3.8 to 7.6 admissions per 100,000 adults; and increasing by 58.4% in England between 2006 and 2017, from 7.9 to 12.5 admissions per 100,000 adults. This contrasts with the decline in hospitalizations from RA. There are multiple contributing factors to the epidemic of gout hospitalizations: the prevalence of gout has increased in Western countries in recent years on a background of an ageing population with rising prevalences of obesity and metabolic syndrome; the management of gout is frequently suboptimal in primary care, rheumatology clinics, and inpatient settings.

### Initiation of allopurinol at first medical contact for acute attacks of gout: a randomized clinical trial [^111kgTxe]. The American Journal of Medicine (2012). High credibility.

Streamlining the initiation of allopurinol could result in a cost benefit for a common medical problem and obviate the perception that no treatment is required once acute attacks have resolved. Our objective was to test the hypothesis that there is no difference in patient daily pain or subsequent attacks with early versus delayed initiation of allopurinol for an acute gout attack.

- **Methods**: A total of 57 men with crystal-proven gout were randomized to receive allopurinol 300 mg daily or a matching placebo for 10 days. All subjects received indomethacin 50 mg three times per day for 10 days, a prophylactic dose of colchicine 0.6 mg twice per day for 90 days, and open-label allopurinol starting at day 11. Primary outcome measures were pain on a visual analogue scale (VAS) for the primary joint from days 1 to 10 and self-reported flares in any joint through day 30.

- **Results**: On the basis of 51 evaluable subjects (allopurinol in 26, placebo in 25), mean daily VAS pain scores did not differ significantly between study groups at any point between days 1 and 10. Initial VAS pain scores for allopurinol and placebo arms were 6.72 versus 6.28 (P = 0.37), declining to 0.18 versus 0.27 (P = 0.54) at day 10, with neither group consistently having more daily pain. Subsequent flares occurred in two subjects taking allopurinol and three subjects taking placebo (P = 0.60). Although urate levels decreased rapidly in the allopurinol group, from 7.8 mg/dL at baseline to 5.9 mg/dL at day 3, sedimentation rates and C-reactive protein levels did not differ between groups at any point.

### Long-term follow-up of a randomized controlled trial of allopurinol dose escalation to achieve target serum urate in people with gout [^114KeWJJ]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2022). High credibility.

The objective of this study was to determine the long-term use of and adherence to urate-lowering therapy (ULT), control of serum urate (SU), and self-reported flares in participants from a randomized controlled trial of allopurinol dose escalation, aiming to achieve a target SU concentration (< 0.36 mmol/L) in people with gout.

Methods for the surviving study participants included a medical record review to obtain data on ULT dispensing and SU testing within the preceding 12 months. Additionally, a phone interview was conducted to assess self-reported flares and adherence.

Over a mean follow-up of 6.5 years (SD 2.5 years) since enrollment, 60 out of 183 participants (33%) had died. A review of the 119 surviving participants showed that 98 (82%) were receiving allopurinol, 5 (4%) were receiving febuxostat, and 10 (8%) were not receiving ULT, with ULT use undetermined in 6 participants (5.0%). Among those receiving allopurinol, the mean dose was 28.1 mg/day lower (range -600 to 500 mg/day) than at the last study visit; 49% were on the same dose, 18% were on a higher dose, and 33% were on a lower dose. SU values were available for 86 out of the 119 participants (72%); of these, 50 participants (58%) had an SU concentration of < 0.36 mmol/L. Among the 89 participants who took part in the phone interview, 19 (21%) reported a gout flare in the preceding 12 months, and 79 (89%) were receiving allopurinol; of the allopurinol users, 71 participants (90%) reported 90% or greater adherence.

The conclusion is that most of the surviving participants in the allopurinol dose escalation study showed good real-world persistence and adherence to the treatment regimen.

### Implementing treat-to-target urate-lowering therapy during hospitalizations for gout flares [^117H6y7n]. Rheumatology (2024). Low credibility.

Of pre- and post-implementation cohorts, 93.3% and 98.1%, respectively, received a guideline-recommended flare treatment. After implementation, more patients were prescribed colchicine (62.2% vs 79.6%; aOR 2.30; 95% CI 1.23, 4.31; P = 0.009), corticosteroids (21.0% vs 37.0%; aOR 2.20; 95% CI 1.21, 4.02; P = 0.010), or multiple flare treatments (17.6% vs 45.4%; aOR 4.10; 95% CI 2.20, 7.67; P < 0.001). Use of intra-articular corticosteroids increased modestly from a low baseline (1.7% vs 8.3%; aOR 5.53; 95% CI 1.15, 26.7; P = 0.033).

There was no significant difference in the use of NSAIDs (31.9% vs 31.5%; aOR 1.18; 95% CI 0.61, 2.28; P = 0.63).

The proportion of patients initiated and/or up-titrated on ULT prior to discharge increased markedly following implementation, from 17.6% to 62.0% (aOR 7.69; 95% CI 4.12, 14.4; P < 0.001). After implementation, more patients were provided with gout-specific management recommendations on discharge (58.8% vs 86.1%; aOR 4.33; 95% CI 2.21, 8.48; P < 0.001). Documented evidence of disease education provision prior to discharge was low in both cohorts (22.7% vs 22.2%; aOR 1.00; 95% CI 0.53, 1.90; P = 0.99).

### Colchicine for prophylaxis of acute flares when initiating allopurinol for chronic gouty arthritis [^114EkSKA]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2004). Low credibility.

Use of colchicine to prevent acute gout flares during initiation of allopurinol therapy is widely practiced despite a lack of proven benefit. We investigated if colchicine administration during the initiation of allopurinol for chronic gouty arthritis reduces the frequency and/or severity of acute gout flares.

- **Methods**: Patients starting allopurinol for crystal-proven chronic gouty arthritis were randomized to receive colchicine 0.6 mg po bid or placebo in a randomized, prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Subjects were followed for evidence of acute gout flares and remained on the study drug for 3 months beyond attaining a serum urate concentration < 6.5 mg/dl. Treatment arms were analyzed regarding frequency of flares, likelihood of any flare or multiple flares, severity of flares on the visual analog scale (VAS), and length of flares in days.

- **Results**: Forty-three subjects were studied. Subjects treated with colchicine experienced fewer total flares (0.52 vs. 2.91, p = 0.008), fewer flares from 0 to 3 months (0.57 vs. 1.91, p = 0.022), fewer flares 3–6 months (0 vs. 1.05, p = 0.033), less severe flares as reported on VAS (3.64 vs. 5.08, p = 0.018), and fewer reGout flares (p = 0.001). Colchicine was well tolerated.

- **Conclusion**: Colchicine prophylaxis during initiation of allopurinol for chronic gouty arthritis reduces the frequency and severity of acute flares and reduces the likelihood of reFlares. Treating patients with colchicine during initiation of allopurinol therapy for 6 months is supported by our data.

### Gout: Will the "king of diseases" be the first rheumatic disease to be cured [^111dUatd]? BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Treatment guidelines for gout have been recently published by both the ACR in 2012 and the EULAR in 2016. Several key aspects of appropriate management are addressed in these treatment guidelines, which should be helpful to providers since gout care is critically suboptimal. A controversial recommendation to limit the maximum dose of allopurinol in patients with gout and chronic kidney disease by adjusting to creatinine clearance in EULAR guidelines has been challenged, as the risk of hypersensitivity reactions associated with allopurinol seems to be related to the starting dose, not the maximal dose. Therefore, there is currently no rationale to limit the maximum dose of allopurinol in patients with gout and chronic kidney disease.

Treat-to-target (T2T) serum urate (sUA) is not a new concept in gout, but it has been brought to center stage by the leading treatment recommendations in the ACR and the EULAR guidelines, as well as by a recent consensus statement about T2T. The rheumatology community considers the existing evidence regarding T2T to a goal of sUA less than 6 mg/dL in gout as sufficient based on three key correlates for achieving sUA less than 6 mg/dL:

- **Associated benefits**: Reduction of gout flares, tophi, and medical care costs by achieving and maintaining this target
- **Threshold below solubility**: This sUA target is below the solubility threshold of urate, which prevents its crystallization in body fluids at 6.8 mg/dL
- **Primary outcome measure**: The use of this sUA threshold as a primary outcome

### What makes gouty inflammation so variable [^115mVtZi]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

The intersecting effects of therapeutics on gouty inflammation reveal complex interactions among treatment options. The mechanisms of action for primary treatments, both for prophylaxis and treatment of acute gout, intersect with numerous novel inflammation-mediating pathways. Notably, medications such as indomethacin, ibuprofen, and certain other NSAIDs activate PPAR-γ. Corticosteroids, known for inhibiting the transcription of many inflammatory genes, also regulate annexin A1. Paradoxically, they can induce NLRP3, potentially contributing to rebound flares of acute gout after the cessation of steroid therapy. Low doses of colchicine do not merely suppress neutrophil and endothelial functions but also exert various inflammatory effects in macrophages, primarily through colchicine-induced activation of AMPK.

With respect to investigational agents, randomized clinical trials of the IL-1β-specific monoclonal antibody canakinumab have demonstrated superiority over a single dose of 40 mg triamcinolone acetonide in reducing pain during acute gout and delaying the time to the next acute gout flare. Canakinumab is approved in Europe as an option for acute gout therapy. Multiple retrospective case series have reported on the efficacy of anakinra (recombinant IL-1ra) in treating acute gout in many, though not all, patients. The failure of the IL-1 blocker rilonacept in acute gout (though not for anti-inflammatory flare prophylaxis) may be attributed to its binding to IL-1ra. Finally, the partial PPAR-γ agonist arhalofenate, a uricosuric, has been associated with a decreased frequency of acute gout flares.

### Management of gout in chronic kidney disease: A G-CAN consensus statement on the research priorities [^114TZDE4]. Nature Reviews Rheumatology (2021). Low credibility.

For drugs used in the management of gout flares or flare prophylaxis when starting ULT (namely NSAIDs, colchicine, corticosteroids, and IL-1 inhibitors), the efficacy outcomes of interest are the resolution or prevention of gout flares, respectively. For this G-CAN consensus statement, safety outcomes for each drug were individualized. The specific issues identified with medications used for the management of gout flares and prophylaxis in people with CKD are discussed below, and the G-CAN-proposed research priorities are outlined here.

- **Colchicine**:
	- **Treatment of gout flares**:
		- Safe and effective dosing of colchicine in chronic kidney disease (CKD). How should the AGREE trial colchicine dose be modified in different stages of CKD?
		- How should colchicine be used in people with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on dialysis?
		- Is the risk of drug interactions with colchicine greater in patients with CKD?
		- Whether the dose of colchicine should be altered when used in combination with atorvastatin in people with CKD.
	- **Gout flare prophylaxis**:
		- Can low-dose colchicine be used in people with ESRD on dialysis?
		- Is there an increased risk of adverse effects with low-dose, longer-term colchicine use in people with CKD?

- **NSAIDs**:
	- **Treatment of gout flares**:
		- Are short-term NSAIDs safe in the context of ESRD?
		- Are longer-term NSAIDs safe in the context of ESRD?
	- **Gout flare prophylaxis**:
		- Are some NSAIDs safer than others for longer-term prophylactic use?

- **Glucocorticoids**:
	- **Treatment of gout flares**:
		- What are the appropriate use and dosing guidelines?

These research priorities highlight critical areas for further investigation to improve the management of gout in patients with CKD.

In the management of gout, particularly concerning allopurinol, the EULAR 2017 guidelines recommend adjusting the maximum dosage of allopurinol according to creatinine clearance (CrCl) in patients with renal impairment. If the serum urate target cannot be achieved at this adjusted dose, the guidelines suggest switching to febuxostat or benzbromarone, or adding benzbromarone to allopurinol. However, these options are not recommended for patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) less than 30 mL/min.

### Interleukin-1 inhibitors for acute gout [^114gt9LN]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Acute gout flares cause significant pain and disability, making it important to provide quick and effective pain relief. Traditional options for managing acute flares include colchicine, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and glucocorticoids.

- **Objectives**: To assess the benefits and harms of interleukin-1 inhibitors (anakinra, canakinumab, rilonacept) in acute gout.

- **Search methods**: We searched The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, and EMBASE on 19 June 2013. No date or language restrictions were applied. We performed a hand search of the abstracts from the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) (2009 to 2012) and American College of Rheumatology (ACR) (2009 to 2011) conferences and reviewed the references of all included trials. We also screened the Clinical Trials Registry Platform of the World Health Organization and the Clinical Trials Registry Platform of the US National Institutes of Health.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-randomized clinical trials (controlled clinical trials (CCTs)) assessing an interleukin-1 inhibitor (anakinra, canakinumab, or rilonacept) against a placebo or another active treatment. These included colchicine, paracetamol, NSAIDs, glucocorticoids (systemic or intra-articular), adrenocorticotropic hormone, a different interleukin-1 blocking agent, or a combination of any of the above in adults with acute gout.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed the risk of bias, and extracted the data. If appropriate, we pooled data in a meta-analysis. We assessed…

### Management of gout in chronic kidney disease: A G-CAN consensus statement on the research priorities [^113a5V3x]. Nature Reviews Rheumatology (2021). Low credibility.

Drugs used to manage gout flares

NSAIDs are generally contraindicated in people with CKD, and the published literature on gout generally aims to show the potential for renal-related adverse effects in people with CKD. Although NSAIDs have well-established adverse effects, there has been some suggestion that these drugs could be used in those with end-stage renal disease for short periods of time.

There are a small number of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on colchicine for the treatment of gout flares, and none of these reported outcomes stratified by renal function. Pharmacokinetic studies have indicated that clearance of colchicine is decreased in those with severe kidney impairment (eGFR 15–29 ml/min/1.73 m²) and that there is minimal clearance of colchicine by hemodialysis. Thus, the recommendations for the use of colchicine in CKD remain largely empirical.

Corticosteroids have been generally accepted as the safest option in most people with gout flares and concomitant CKD. The newer IL-1 antagonist therapies, such as canakinumab and anakinra, are not widely available, and there are no RCTs investigating their use in people with gout and CKD for which results are presented according to kidney function. Data from case series and case reports are reassuring. Essentially, these agents are widely used for a variety of conditions, but there is a relative paucity of data on their use in people with gout and CKD. In people without gout, the clearance of anakinra has been shown to be directly related to renal function, and the drug is not cleared by dialysis. It has therefore…

### Colchicine concentrations and relationship with colchicine efficacy and adverse events: Post hoc analysis of a randomized clinical trial of colchicine for gout flare prophylaxis [^113UohHc]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). High credibility.

Strengths of this study include the analysis of a randomized clinical trial with consistent measurement of adverse events and blood tests, together with comprehensive concomitant medication data collection. Limitations are that the study was not powered to detect rare adverse events due to colchicine and that the study design did not allow analysis of the safety of higher doses of colchicine or longer durations. The study was not designed as a formal pharmacokinetics study. It is important to note that there is substantial variation in colchicine bioavailability in healthy individuals, with additional variation possible in people with gout due to polypharmacy and genetic variants in transporters, among other factors.

In addition, there is widespread distribution of colchicine into cells and tissues, where its anti-inflammatory effects are exerted, compared to the much lower levels observed in plasma. The inability to assess drug concentration in tissues where colchicine exerts its anti-inflammatory effects, such as leukocytes, as well as calculate the volume of distribution, is a limitation. The samples collected did not allow us to accurately calculate volume of distribution or area under the curve, and there is wide variation in these parameters, as shown in a small study in healthy volunteers in which total body colchicine clearance was approximately doubled and the area under the curve was approximately four times less for healthy individuals compared with older individuals. Finally, the sampling may have missed the true peak concentrations in some individuals.

### Colchicine concentrations and relationship with colchicine efficacy and adverse events: Post hoc analysis of a randomized clinical trial of colchicine for gout flare prophylaxis [^111RCkTS]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). High credibility.

Low-dose oral colchicine (0.5 mg once or twice daily) is one of the first-line recommended therapies for prevention of gout flares when commencing urate-lowering therapy. Although colchicine may be effective, it has a number of potential adverse events, the most common being gastrointestinal, including nausea and diarrhea. In people with gout, gastrointestinal adverse events are dose-dependent, with more occurrences observed in those who received a higher dose (4.8 mg over four hours) versus a low dose (1.8 mg over one hour) in a study of gout flares, albeit with no difference in circulating maximum concentration (C max) between the two colchicine doses in healthy volunteers. Other less common adverse events include bone marrow suppression and neuromyotoxicity, which may occur with more prolonged use.

- **Significance & innovations**: Colchicine concentrations increase with concomitant statin use; however, this does not result in muscle-related adverse events. Regular monitoring of creatine kinase (CK) may not be required; rather, targeted measurement of CK in individuals with muscle symptoms may be more appropriate. Colchicine therapeutic drug monitoring is of limited value in clinical practice.

Impaired kidney function, which is common in people with gout, is reported to be a predictor of colchicine adverse events. Because of the risk, it has been suggested that a complete blood count and a creatine kinase (CK) measurement should be performed every six months in patients who are receiving long-term prophylactic colchicine, defined as 0.5 mg daily.

### Cardiovascular events in patients with gout initiating urate-lowering therapy with or without colchicine for flare prophylaxis: a retrospective new-user cohort study using linked primary care, hospitalisation, and mortality data [^117FeDfo]. The Lancet Rheumatology (2025). High credibility.

Initiating urate-lowering therapy can trigger gout flares. Gout flares have been associated with a temporally increased risk of cardiovascular events. Therefore, we aimed to estimate the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with gout initiating urate-lowering therapy with flare prophylaxis using colchicine (the drug recommended for gout flare prophylaxis by many international societies) compared with no prophylaxis.

- **Methods**: We did a retrospective new-user cohort study using data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink Aurum, an English primary-care database linked to hospitalisation and mortality records. People with gout initiating urate-lowering therapy for the first time were eligible for inclusion. We compared people prescribed flare prophylaxis with colchicine with those not prescribed any gout flare prophylaxis. Colchicine prophylaxis (defined as prescription for ≥ 21 days) prescribed on the same date as urate-lowering therapy was the exposure of interest. A composite of fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction or stroke within 180 days after urate-lowering therapy initiation regardless of any previous cardiovascular event was the primary outcome. Propensity score overlap weighting was used to balance covariates across study groups. We used Cox regression and performed intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses, the latter with an inverse probability of censoring weighting. The association was measured using hazard ratio and risk difference with 95% CIs. Members of The UK Gout Society were involved in prioritising the research question.

### Comparative efficacy of low-dose versus regular-dose colchicine to prevent flares in gout patients initiated on urate-lowering therapies [^11266isE]. Rheumatology (2021). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to compare the prophylactic effect of regular-dose (RD, 1.2 mg/day) versus low-dose (LD, 0.6 mg/day) colchicine on gout flares when initiating urate-lowering therapy.

- **Methods**: In this retrospective cohort study, we included gout patients who were initiated on either allopurinol or febuxostat, in combination with colchicine therapy, and followed them up for three months. We analyzed the rates of gout flare and adverse events according to the dose of colchicine. We performed inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) and weighted logistic regression analysis to assess the treatment effect. Analysis of gout flares and adverse events was conducted on an intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol (PP) basis.

- **Results**: Of the total of 419 patients with gout, 177 patients (42.2%) received LD colchicine, whereas 242 patients (57.8%) received RD colchicine. Lower body mass index and estimated glomerular filtration rate, and higher incidence of cardiovascular disease were observed in the LD group compared to the RD group. In IPTW-adjusted analysis, events of gout flare were not significantly different between the LD and RD groups [ITT: 14.3% vs. 11.3%; odds ratio (OR): 1.309, 95% CI: 0.668, 2.566, P = 0.432; PP: 15.3% vs. 10.0%; OR: 1.623, 95% CI: 0.765, 3.443, P = 0.207]. However, LD colchicine was associated with a lower rate of adverse events than RD colchicine [ITT: 8.2% vs. 17.9%; OR: 0.410, 95% CI: 0.217, 0.777; P < 0.05; PP: 8.4% vs. 17.2%; OR: 0.442, 95% CI: 0.223, 0.878; P < 0.05].

Our data suggest that LD colchicine can adequately prevent gout flares with fewer adverse events compared to RD colchicine.

### Updates in the management of gout [^115dzN3p]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

The majority of patients with gout are cared for by primary care physicians. Although both the physician and patient may easily recognize the acute arthritis of gout, errors in selecting the most appropriate medication and proper dose are common. The clinical stages of gout include asymptomatic hyperuricemia, intermittent gouty arthritis, and chronic tophaceous gout. Treatment of gout is usually considered after the first attack of arthritis, typically podagra. The aims of treatment are to alleviate the pain and inflammation associated with acute attacks, prevent future attacks, and decrease uric acid levels. Confusion frequently arises because certain medications, such as colchicine, may have dual purposes: to treat an acute attack and to suppress future attacks. The purpose of this management update is to provide practical advice about prescribing the proper medication considering both treatment goals and patient comorbidities.

### Comparison of gout flares with the initiation of treat-to-target allopurinol and febuxostat: A post-hoc analysis of a randomized multicenter trial [^112MQTe5]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2024). High credibility.

The initiation of urate-lowering therapy (ULT) in gout patients can precipitate arthritis flares. Limited comparisons exist regarding the flare risk during the initiation and escalation of allopurinol and febuxostat administered as a treat-to-target strategy with optimal anti-inflammatory prophylaxis.

This study is a post-hoc analysis of a 72-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, noninferiority trial, which compared the efficacy of allopurinol and febuxostat. For this analysis, flare occurrences were examined during weeks 0 to 24 when ULT was initiated and titrated to a serum urate (sUA) goal of less than 6 mg/dl, or less than 5 mg/dl if tophi were present. Flares were assessed at regular intervals through structured participant interviews, and predictors of flare, including treatment assignment, were examined using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression.

The study participants (n = 940) were predominantly male (98.4%) with a mean age of 62.1 years and received either allopurinol or febuxostat in approximately equal proportions. The mean baseline sUA was 8.5 mg/dl, and all participants received anti-inflammatory prophylaxis (90% colchicine). In a multivariable model, there were no significant associations of ULT treatment (hazard ratio [HR] 1.17 for febuxostat vs allopurinol), ULT-dose escalation (HR 1.18 vs no escalation), prophylaxis type, or individual comorbidity with flare. There was also no evidence of ULT-dose escalation interaction. Factors independently associated with flare risk during ULT initiation/escalation included younger age, higher baseline sUA, and absence of tophi.

### Gout: Can management be improved [^111Y9QLk]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2001). Low credibility.

Ongoing reviews of Cochrane Collaboration show that there is still very little reliable information based on randomized controlled trials on which to base treatment decisions in acute and chronic gout. Recent studies have stressed that avoidance of factors contributing to the development of gouty attacks, such as diuretic therapy, weight gain, and alcohol consumption, may lead to a decrease in gouty arthritis. Attention to minidose aspirin and its effect on serum uric acid levels was addressed. A low carbohydrate, high protein, and unsaturated fat diet was recommended for gouty patients since they all enhance insulin sensitivity and therefore may promote a reduction in serum uric acid levels. Treatment of gout in transplant recipients brings into focus some of the issues regarding management of gout, because gout is a common problem among transplant patients.

### When underlying biology threatens the randomization principle - initial gout flares of urate-lowering therapy [^1117jaHD]. Nature Reviews Rheumatology (2022). Low credibility.

Flare is the dominant feature of gout and occurs because of the inflammatory response to monosodium urate crystals; prevention of gout flares should be the major goal of gout care. However, a paradoxical increase in the risk of flare following initiation of urate-lowering therapy presents considerable challenges for proving the expected long-term benefits of flare prevention in clinical trials.

Excluding flares that occur in the initial post-randomization period (which can last several months to 1 year) can threaten the core benefits of randomization. The characteristics of the remaining participants can differ from those who were randomized, introducing potential bias from confounding (both measured and unmeasured). Participants who drop out or die are excluded from the analysis, introducing potential selection bias. Finally, ignoring initial flares underestimates participants' experience during the trial.

This perspective discusses these issues and recommends measures that will allow for high-level evidence that preserves the randomization principle, to satisfy methodological scrutiny and generate robust evidence-based guidelines for gout care.

### 2016 updated EULAR evidence-based recommendations for the management of gout [^115Un7gV]. Annals of the rheumatic diseases (2017). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of gout, with a specific focus on allopurinol, EULAR 2017 guidelines recommend initiating allopurinol as first-line urate-lowering therapy in patients with normal kidney function. The recommended approach is to start at a low dose of 100 mg/day and increase by 100 mg increments every 2–4 weeks, if required, to reach the uricemia target.

### Colcrys [^115yiPmM]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Colcrys is used for the management of gout flares.

- **Gout flares prophylaxis**: For the prophylaxis of gout flares in patients with mild (estimated creatinine clearance [Clcr] 50 to 80 mL/min) to moderate (Clcr 30 to 50 mL/min) renal function impairment, adjustment of the recommended dose is not required, but patients should be monitored closely for adverse effects of colchicine. However, in patients with severe impairment, the starting dose should be 0.3 mg/day, and any increase in dose should be done with close monitoring. For the prophylaxis of gout flares in patients undergoing dialysis, the starting dose should be 0.3 mg given twice a week with close monitoring [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

- **Treatment of gout flares**: For the treatment of gout flares in patients with mild (Clcr 50 to 80 mL/min) to moderate (Clcr 30 to 50 mL/min) renal function impairment, adjustment of the recommended dose is not required, but patients should be monitored closely for adverse effects of colchicine. However, in patients with severe impairment, while the dose does not need to be adjusted for the treatment of gout flares, a treatment course should be repeated no more than once every two weeks. For patients with gout flares requiring repeated courses, consideration should be given to alternate therapy. For patients undergoing dialysis, the total recommended dose for the treatment of gout flares should be reduced to a single dose of 0.6 mg (one tablet). For these patients, the treatment course should not be repeated more than once every two weeks [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

### Prophylaxis for acute gout flares after initiation of urate-lowering therapy [^113UXfU7]. Rheumatology (2014). Low credibility.

This review summarizes evidence relating to prophylaxis for gout flares after the initiation of urate-lowering therapy (ULT). We searched MEDLINE via PubMed for articles published in English from 1963 to 2013 using MeSH terms covering all aspects of prophylaxis for flares. Dispersion of monosodium urate crystals during the initial phase of deposit dissolution with ULT exposes the patient to an increased rate of acute flares that could contribute to poor treatment adherence. Slow titration of ULT might decrease the risk of flares.

According to the most recent international recommendation, the two first-line options for prophylaxis are low-dose colchicine (0.5 mg once or twice a day) or low-dose NSAIDs such as naproxen 250 mg orally twice a day. They can be given for up to 6 months. If these drugs are contraindicated, not tolerated, or ineffective, low-dose corticosteroids (prednisone or prednisolone) might be used. Recently, reports for four trials described the efficacy of canakinumab and rilonacept, two IL-1 inhibitors, for preventing flares during the initiation of allopurinol therapy.

Prophylaxis for flares induced by ULT is an important consideration in gout management. Low-dose colchicine and low-dose NSAIDs are the recommended first-line therapies. Although no IL-1 blockers are approved as prophylactic treatment, this class of drug could become an interesting option for patients with gout with intolerance or contraindication to colchicine, NSAIDs, or corticosteroids.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for gout, specifically in relation to indications for switching urate-lowering agents, the ACR 2020 guidelines recommend considering a switch to an alternative urate-lowering agent if available. This is particularly advised for patients with gout taking febuxostat who have a history of cardiovascular disease or have experienced a new cardiovascular event.

### Relationship between gout flare states and patient-reported outcomes after allopurinol initiation [^116Xneop]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). Low credibility.

Gout flares are the most significant clinical feature for individuals experiencing gout. These flares influence nearly every aspect of life, including physical, psychological, social, and family life. Prevention of gout flares is, therefore, a crucial management goal for both healthcare providers and patients with gout. Despite this importance, many studies on urate-lowering therapies have used serum urate (SU) as a "surrogate" measure for gout flares. However, the burden of gout flares is multifaceted, encompassing both the frequency of flares and the severity of each individual flare. Defining the overall flare burden for gout patients has been challenging due to variable reporting and the lack of a validated severity definition for flares.

- **Significance & innovations**: Flare prevention and treatment are critical aspects of gout management. As the burden of gout flares increases, so does their impact on the patient. Most individuals initiating allopurinol treatment are able to achieve a patient-acceptable symptom state or low disease activity in the second six months of treatment.

### Colcrys [^1121p1mK]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

The long-term use of colchicine is established for familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) and the prophylaxis of gout flares. However, the safety and efficacy of repeat treatment for gout flares have not been evaluated. The dosing regimens for Colcrys vary depending on the indication and must be individualized.

The recommended dosage of Colcrys depends on the patient's age, renal function, hepatic function, and the use of coadministered drugs [see Dosage and Administration (2.4, 2.5, 2.6)]. Colcrys tablets are administered orally without regard to meals. Colcrys is not an analgesic medication and should not be used to treat pain from other causes.

- **Gout flares**:
	- **Prophylaxis of gout flares**: The recommended dosage of Colcrys for prophylaxis of gout flares for adults and adolescents older than 16 years is 0.6 mg once or twice daily. The maximum recommended dose for prophylaxis of gout flares is 1.2 mg/day.
	- An increase in gout flares may occur after initiation of uric acid-lowering therapy, including pegloticase, febuxostat, and allopurinol, due to changing serum uric acid levels resulting in mobilization of urate from tissue deposits. Colcrys is recommended upon initiation of gout flare prophylaxis with uric acid-lowering therapy. Prophylactic therapy may be beneficial for at least the first six months of uric acid-lowering therapy.
	- **Treatment of gout flares**: The recommended dose of Colcrys for the treatment of a gout flare is 1.2 mg (two tablets) at the first sign of the flare, followed by 0.6 mg (one tablet) one hour later. Higher doses have not been found to be more effective.

### Initiation of febuxostat for acute gout flare does not prolong the current episode: A randomized clinical trial [^1178vY6y]. Rheumatology (2021). High credibility.

Gout is a common arthritic condition resulting from monosodium urate (MSU) crystal deposition. Urate-lowering treatment (ULT) is important for patients with gout. Previous guidelines have provided conflicting recommendations on whether ULT could be initiated during an acute gout flare. Generally, ULT should be initiated after an acute flare has resolved to avoid prolongation of symptoms. The incidence of gout flares has been positively correlated with the reduction of serum uric acid (sUA) levels in the first few months after initiating ULT.

However, ULT could be initiated during an acute flare to reduce the number of outpatient treatment visits required and thus increase patient compliance. The 2016 EULAR Gout Management Recommendations have not provided clear guidance on this. In addition, the 2020 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Guidelines for the management of gout have conditionally recommended that pharmacological urate-lowering therapy could be initiated during an acute gout flare based on anti-inflammatory treatment. However, this recommendation was graded moderate based on two small randomized clinical trials and an observational study.

Two small randomized clinical trials observed that initiating allopurinol treatment during an acute gout flare did not prolong painful gout flares. Febuxostat (40 mg/day) had a superior urate-lowering effect compared with limited allopurinol doses (maximum 200–300 mg/day). At present, no studies have been published regarding the initiation of febuxostat for acute gout flares.

### Gout flares after stopping anti-inflammatory prophylaxis: A rapid literature review and meta-analysis [^114D7JUb]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). High credibility.

The aim of this research was to determine how common gout flares are after ceasing anti-inflammatory prophylaxis. A rapid literature review and meta-analysis were undertaken. PubMed was searched from inception to February 2024. Eligibility criteria included any clinical trial of people with gout with at least one arm starting or intensifying urate-lowering therapy (ULT) with coprescription of anti-inflammatory prophylaxis and that had the percentage of participants experiencing one or more gout flares reported during and after the period of prophylaxis. Random effects meta-analyses were used to generate pooled estimates of the percentage of participants experiencing one or more flares in each period.

Six trials were included, along with aggregated, unpublished data from the VA STOP Gout trial (2,972 participants). Pooled random effects estimates of the percentage of participants having one or more gout flares were 14.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] 11.3–18.5%) during prophylaxis, 29.7% (95% CI 22.9–37.0%) in the three-month period after ceasing prophylaxis, and 12.2% (95% CI 6.8–19.0%) during the last study period. The mean difference in the percentage of participants having one or more gout flare while taking prophylaxis and immediately after ceasing prophylaxis was -14.8% (95% CI -21.2% to -8.5%; P < 0.0001). The mean difference from the period immediately following prophylaxis discontinuation compared to the last study period was 16.0% (P < 0.001). Sensitivity analyses indicated no material effects of prophylaxis duration or trial duration.

### Evaluating appropriate use of prophylactic colchicine for gout flare prevention [^116KLR43]. Arthritis Care & Research (2014). Low credibility.

The American College of Rheumatology and European League Against Rheumatism guidelines recommend colchicine to prevent gout flares in patients initiating and increasing uric acid–lowering therapy until serum uric acid is maintained at ≤ 6 mg/dl. This study aimed to evaluate how well colchicine prescribing practices adhere to these guidelines and to examine factors associated with improved prescribing.

Electronic medical records were reviewed for 126 patients with active colchicine prescriptions for prophylaxis of gout flares. Colchicine prescribing was defined as inappropriate if:

1. No urate-lowering therapy was prescribed.
2. Uric acid was not at goal and urate-lowering therapy had not been increased in the past 3 months.
3. Uric acid goals were met for over 1 year, and flares had resolved in the absence of tophi.

Colchicine use was considered inappropriate in 93 patients (73.8%). Of these, thirty-four were prescribed no urate-lowering therapy, 50 were above the uric acid goal without an increase in urate-lowering therapy in the prior 3 months, and 9 were at the uric acid goal for more than 1 year without flares or tophi. Patients appropriately prescribed colchicine were younger and were more likely to have been seen by a rheumatologist. The allopurinol dose and allergy, uric acid level, and renal function were similar in the two groups.

In conclusion, we found a high prevalence of what we considered inappropriate prophylactic colchicine use, driven largely by the failure to prescribe urate-lowering therapies or adequately increase these medications. Rheumatology consultations are recommended to improve prescribing practices.

### Gout [^112mKYhA]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2008). Low credibility.

Gout affects about 5% of men and 1% of women, with up to 80% of people experiencing a reattack within 3 years.

- **Methods and outcomes**: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatments for acute gout? What are the effects of treatments to prevent gout in people with prior acute episodes? We searched Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to June 2008 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review).

### 2016 updated EULAR evidence-based recommendations for the management of gout [^114K3gdW]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2017). High credibility.

Regarding the follow-up and surveillance for gout — specifically about indications for switching urate-lowering agents — the EULAR 2017 guidelines recommend switching from allopurinol to febuxostat or benzbromarone. Alternatively, benzbromarone can be added to allopurinol if the serum urate target cannot be achieved in patients with renal impairment (excluding patients with eGFR < 30 mL/min) who are receiving the maximum dosage of allopurinol adjusted to CrCl.

### A randomized, double-blind, active- and placebo-controlled efficacy and safety study of arhalofenate for reducing flare in patients with gout [^112CwegN]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2016). Low credibility.

Two hundred thirty-nine gout patients who had at least three flare episodes during the previous year were randomized and treated in this study. The primary efficacy outcome measure was met, as demonstrated by the finding that arhalofenate at a daily dose of 800 mg reduced the incidence of flare compared to allopurinol at a daily dose of 300 mg, in both a statistically and clinically significant manner (a 46% incidence reduction). More patients in the 800 mg arhalofenate group experienced no flares during treatment than did patients in the 300 mg allopurinol group, and patients in the 800 mg arhalofenate group tended to have fewer flares than did patients in the 300 mg allopurinol group.

In this study, the known antiflare activity of colchicine was confirmed, further validating the electronic diary technology and the definition of flare that was used. The flare incidence was both clinically and statistically decreased in the 300 mg allopurinol plus 0.6 mg colchicine group compared with the 300 mg allopurinol group. There was no significant difference in flare incidence between the 800 mg arhalofenate group and the 300 mg allopurinol plus 0.6 mg colchicine group, although the study was not powered to test this comparison. Thus, the clinical utility of 800 mg arhalofenate to prevent gout attacks will have to be judged in the context of the respective risk-benefit ratio of each flare treatment. While colchicine is an effective antiflare therapy, it does not reduce serum uric acid; it can be poorly tolerated with diarrhea or abdominal cramps, and it can potentially cause other side effects.

### The pathophysiology of hyperuricaemia and its possible relationship to cardiovascular disease, morbidity and mortality [^113CvsWg]. BMC Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Standard treatment consists of acute anti-inflammatory drugs for gouty flares, followed by long-term urate-lowering therapy. Anti-inflammatory treatment aims to reduce pain and swelling. Established treatments include NSAIDs and sometimes corticosteroids. Colchicine can be used as gout prophylaxis, especially when urate-lowering therapy is first introduced, but it is also used for acute gout. Drugs targeting IL-1β, such as rilonacept and canakinumab, are also effective in acute gout.

Primary urate-lowering therapy is often initiated with an XO inhibitor such as allopurinol or febuxostat. The number of patients achieving serum urate levels below 6 mg/dL (0.35 mmol/L) ranges from 20–40% for allopurinol and 45–67% for febuxostat (Phase III data), indicating the need for additional therapies. Moreover, allopurinol can have both dose-related side effects (e.g. gastrointestinal intolerance, rashes) and idiosyncratic side effects that can be life-threatening and may be more frequent in Asians.

Examples of non-specific uricosuric drugs include the older URAT1 inhibitors such as probenecid (which also inhibits OAT1 and 3 and is still available in some countries) and benzbromarone, which has largely been withdrawn due to liver toxicity. Uricosuric drugs in clinical development are mainly URAT1 inhibitors: lesinurad (Phase III), arhalofenate (Phase II and also in development for diabetes), levotofisopam (Phase II and the S-enantiomer of RS-tofisopam, an anxiolytic agent used in some countries), and RDEA3170 (Phase I). Lesinurad can achieve target serum urate levels when given…

### Initiation of febuxostat for acute gout flare does not prolong the current episode: a randomized clinical trial [^115iwpF7]. Rheumatology (2021). High credibility.

The study involved randomization and blinding procedures. One hundred and forty patients who met the study criteria were randomized at a 1:1 ratio without stratification. Patients were administered febuxostat 40 mg daily (febuxostat group) or placebo (placebo group). All patients were initially administered diclofenac (150 mg/day) for 7 days. On day 8, treatments were open-labelled: febuxostat 40 mg daily and diclofenac 75 mg daily were administered from day 8 through 28 for patients in remission. The dose of diclofenac was 150 mg/day before remission in both arms, with the original protocol maintained until remission.

A pre-allocated blocked randomization schedule was implemented using a block size of four. Eligible participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either the febuxostat or the placebo group. Patients were enrolled by study site personnel, and each centre (hospital) recruited participants by means of competition. The College of Public Health Management of Southern Medical University served as the "random centre" to manage and perform the randomization process. To ensure representativeness, each centre enrolled at least 28 subjects.

Each centre had a principal investigator (PI) who knew the treatment code, while another doctor who did not know the treatment code was responsible for assessing inflammation and recording data. Before any study subjects were assigned to a group, the PI requested a randomized number from the "random centre". Medications were self-administered at home and participants were blinded to the treatments assigned.
