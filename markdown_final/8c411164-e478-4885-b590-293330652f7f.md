## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the anatomy of the lymphatic system and its abnormalities. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core anatomical components and their embryology. Then, I should verify the functional physiology and flow dynamics. Next, I will classify abnormalities by etiology and morphology, followed by a region-by-region review of imaging findings. After that, I need to appraise imaging modalities and their strengths and limitations. Finally, I will integrate management principles and highlight knowledge gaps, making sure to double-check key claims against the cited literature throughout.

> Let me first confirm the fundamental anatomy. The lymphatic system is an open, unidirectional network of lymphatic capillaries, pre-collectors, collecting vessels, and lymph nodes, culminating in the thoracic duct on the left and the right lymphatic duct on the right, which return lymph to the venous circulation at the venous angles. This architecture is highly variable between individuals and across developmental stages, which complicates imaging and intervention planning [^116TBMw4] [^113NtvGN] [^111vFkZm].

> Wait, let me verify the embryologic origins because this underpins many anomalies. Lymphatic vessels arise from multiple venous primordia that sprout and fuse during development, explaining the marked anatomical variability and occasional persistence of embryonic channels; this developmental complexity also explains why central lymphatic anomalies can be multifocal and asymmetric [^113NtvGN].

> I will now examine the functional physiology to anchor pathophysiology. Lymphatic capillaries are highly permeable, blind-ended structures that absorb interstitial fluid, proteins, and immune cells; collecting vessels have valves and smooth muscle that generate unidirectional flow via intrinsic contractions and extrinsic forces such as skeletal muscle and respiration; the system returns approximately 2–4 liters of fluid per day to the venous circulation and transports dietary fats via intestinal lacteals, while lymph nodes filter and coordinate immune responses [^1167DMqP] [^1179N62Y] [^111vFkZm].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about disease mechanisms without a coherent classification. I should confirm that abnormalities are broadly categorized as primary (developmental) versus secondary (acquired), and morphologically as malformations (structural defects) versus lymphedema (functional failure), with the 2018 ISSVA framework and the St George's algorithm standardizing nomenclature and guiding molecular testing; this helps align imaging and therapy with underlying biology [^112qfnTC] [^111a2eJN] [^114j6yvk].

> Next, I should review primary lymphatic anomalies. Primary lymphedema spans congenital, early-onset, and late-onset forms, often syndromic, with identified mutations in genes regulating lymphangiogenesis and valve integrity. Lymphatic malformations include microcystic, macrocystic, and mixed lesions, and complex lymphatic anomalies such as generalized lymphatic anomaly, Gorham–Stout disease, kaposiform lymphangiomatosis, and central conducting lymphatic anomaly, which frequently involve multiple compartments and may be driven by somatic mutations in PI3K/AKT/mTOR and related pathways [^111Ucwpb] [^112qfnTC] [^1117KrZJ].

> Let me consider secondary abnormalities carefully. Secondary lymphedema arises from obstruction or injury due to surgery, radiation, malignancy, infection, or trauma; chylous leaks and effusions reflect central lymphatic disruption; in Fontan physiology, elevated central venous pressure impairs lymphatic drainage and can precipitate plastic bronchitis, protein-losing enteropathy, and chylothorax; heart failure and portal hypertension also perturb lymphatic flow and can drive lymphangiectasia and effusions [^116TBMw4] [^113XuipT] [^111vwKMv] [^113vg2gK].

> I should double-check the morphologic spectrum. Aplasia, hypoplasia, and hyperplasia of lymphatic channels, valve incompetence, and lymphangiectasia are common patterns; importantly, capillary lymphatics can appear morphologically abnormal yet remain functionally competent, whereas collecting vessel or valve abnormalities often cause global drainage failure, underscoring the disproportionate functional vulnerability of collectors [^112REzus] [^116WdmuY].

> Now, I will examine regional manifestations, starting with the thorax. In the pulmonary parenchyma, interlobular septal thickening and reversal of lymphatic flow with intravasation of contrast are typical. Pleural chylothorax and mediastinal thoracic duct leak, plexiform duct, and lymphangiectasia are key findings. In Fontan patients, T2-weighted MRI frequently shows dilated, tortuous thoracic duct and abnormal mediastinal lymphatic networks correlating with poor outcomes [^113J1KkT] [^111sUQ7K] [^116JuAo7].

> Let me verify abdominal and hepatic patterns. The liver produces up to half of thoracic duct flow; in portal hypertension and hepatic congestion, non-contrast MR lymphography demonstrates dilated capsular, sublobular, and portal lymphatics; abnormal hepatoperitoneal, hepatopulmonary, hepatomesenteric, and hepatoduodenal connections have been described and correlate with chylothorax, ascites, protein-losing enteropathy, and plastic bronchitis, often requiring organ-specific DCMRL for detection [^114sjeww] [^113vg2gK] [^1134jVTV] [^113jeewn].

> Next, I should review extremity and soft-tissue disease. Primary and secondary lymphedema present with dermal backflow, delayed lymph transport, and characteristic skin changes. Lipedema shows dilated lymphatic vessels but preserved or increased lymphatic pumping without dermal backflow in early stages, distinguishing it from lymphedema. Head and neck lymphatic malformations are common and often require multidisciplinary management due to airway and cosmetic risks [^111Ucwpb] [^1158v8cE] [^113jJ9L6] [^11418Gai].

> I need to ensure the imaging appraisal is methodical. Conventional lymphangiography remains a historic reference but is invasive; lymphoscintigraphy offers functional assessment yet has poor spatial resolution and limited standardization; non-contrast T2-weighted MR lymphangiography rapidly screens for central lymphatic abnormalities; dynamic contrast-enhanced MR lymphangiography (DCMRL) via intranodal, intrahepatic, or intramesenteric access provides high-resolution anatomy and real-time flow, enabling diagnosis and immediate intervention; CT and MRI delineate structural disease and nodal stations; ultrasound guides access and evaluates superficial disease [^116TBMw4] [^111LxMc2] [^115mDDvQ] [^113J1KkT] [^116oN9PN].

> But wait, what about pediatric and congenital heart disease contexts. In single-ventricle patients, pre-Fontan non-contrast MR lymphangiography is increasingly used to screen for thoracic lymphatic abnormalities that predict post-Fontan complications; DCMRL is the gold standard when symptoms persist, and algorithms recommend integrating cardiac catheterization to exclude reversible hemodynamic causes before lymphatic interventions [^112HWLU6] [^116JuAo7].

> I should confirm management principles next. Conservative therapy includes complex decongestive physiotherapy, compression, and lifestyle measures. Interventional options include selective lymphatic duct embolization to occlude abnormal channels while preserving thoracic duct patency, lymphovenous anastomosis or bypass for refractory edema, and surgical or percutaneous decompressive strategies such as innominate vein turn-down in Fontan-related lymphatic failure. Medical therapy increasingly includes targeted agents such as mTOR inhibitors for complex lymphatic anomalies, and emerging pro-lymphangiogenic approaches like controlled-release VEGF-C are under investigation with attention to off-target blood vascular effects [^111Ucwpb] [^1111TJ4v] [^1117KrZJ] [^114CUYfk] [^1121PYKZ].

> Hold on, I should verify the key knowledge gaps so we do not overstate certainties. The field still lacks standardized, quantitative imaging biomarkers for early disease, has limited understanding of organ-specific lymphatic functions such as cardiac and hepatic lymphatics, and needs better predictive models linking genotype to phenotype and treatment response. Recent advances in MR lymphangiography and molecular profiling are beginning to address these gaps, but translation to routine care remains uneven [^115yYjT1] [^116hZp3t] [^1167DMqP].

> In summary, the lymphatic system's open, unidirectional network maintains fluid, lipid, and immune homeostasis. Abnormalities arise from developmental faults or acquired injury and span from localized malformations to systemic flow disorders. Modern imaging — particularly DCMRL — has revolutionized anatomical delineation and procedural planning, enabling targeted interventions within multidisciplinary frameworks, yet variability in anatomy and evolving nomenclature still challenge timely diagnosis and optimal management [^116TBMw4] [^114j6yvk] [^115mDDvQ].

The lymphatic system is a **one-way network** of blind-ended capillaries, collecting vessels, and lymph nodes that returns interstitial fluid and proteins to the venous circulation, transports fats via intestinal lacteals, and supports immune surveillance [^1167DMqP] [^111vFkZm]. Key abnormalities include **lymphedema** (primary or secondary) [^111Ucwpb], **lymphatic malformations** (microcystic, macrocystic, mixed) [^1117KrZJ], and **chylous leaks** (chylothorax, chylous ascites) [^112ovt5X], often due to obstruction, aplasia, or reflux [^112EEUW6] [^116WdmuY] [^112qfnTC]. Imaging with **MRI/MRL, CT, ultrasound, and lymphoscintigraphy** [^116TBMw4] guides diagnosis and intervention [^115mDDvQ]; management spans compression, sclerotherapy, surgery, and targeted therapies [^115hGQKW] [^116cKUiR] [^1117KrZJ].

---

## Normal lymphatic anatomy

- **Lymphatic capillaries**: Blind-ended, highly permeable vessels that absorb interstitial fluid, proteins, and lipids; present in most tissues except bone marrow, CNS, and avascular structures [^1167DMqP] [^111vFkZm].

- **Collecting vessels**: Larger, valved channels with smooth muscle that propel lymph unidirectionally via intrinsic contractions and extrinsic forces (muscle, respiration) [^1167DMqP] [^111vFkZm].

- **Lymph nodes**: Bean-shaped filters (≈600) clustered along vessels, containing lymphocytes and macrophages that cleanse lymph and coordinate immune responses [^115jAWV8] [^111vFkZm].

- **Lymphatic trunks and ducts**: Major channels (thoracic duct, right lymphatic duct) that return lymph to the venous circulation at the subclavian veins [^113THHD1] [^111vFkZm].

## Lymphatic abnormalities

Lymphatic abnormalities arise from **developmental errors**, **obstruction**, or **injury**, producing diverse clinical entities [^1117KrZJ]:

| **Category** | **Examples** | **Pathophysiology** | **Clinical features** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Lymphedema | - Primary (congenital, praecox, tarda) [^notfound] <br/> - Secondary (post-surgical, post-radiation, malignancy, infection) [^112EEUW6] | - Impaired lymph transport [^115hGQKW] <br/> - Lymph accumulation [^111Ucwpb] <br/> - Fibrosis | - Chronic swelling [^111Ucwpb] <br/> - Skin thickening <br/> - Recurrent infections |

## Imaging modalities

Accurate assessment relies on **multimodality imaging**:

- **MRI/MRL**: Gold standard for central lymphatics; DCMRL delineates anatomy/flow and guides interventions [^115mDDvQ] [^112HWLU6].

- **CT**: Identifies structural anomalies, calcifications, and osseous involvement (e.g. GSD) [^112ovt5X].

- **Ultrasound**: First-line for superficial lesions; guides biopsies and sclerotherapy [^notfound].

- **Lymphoscintigraphy**: Functional assessment of lymphatic transport and dermal backflow [^111LxMc2].

---

## Clinical implications and management

Lymphatic abnormalities cause significant morbidity, including chronic edema, recurrent infections, respiratory compromise, and nutritional deficits [^notfound]. Management is **multidisciplinary** and includes:

- **Conservative therapy**: Compression, manual lymphatic drainage, exercise, skin care [^111Ucwpb].

- **Sclerotherapy**: Sclerosing agents (e.g. OK-432, doxycycline) for macrocystic malformations [^notfound].

- **Surgical interventions**: Lymphovenous anastomosis, lymph node transfer, excisional procedures [^112XKbJq].

- **Targeted therapies**: mTOR inhibitors (sirolimus) for complex lymphatic anomalies [^notfound].

---

The lymphatic system maintains fluid, lipid, and immune homeostasis; abnormalities span lymphedema, malformations, and chylous leaks, best managed with **imaging-guided, multidisciplinary care** [^1167DMqP].

### Loss of endothelial tie1 receptor impairs lymphatic vessel development-brief report [^112gXmy1]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

Studies of Tie1 gene-targeted embryos have demonstrated loss of blood vessel integrity, but the relevance of Tie1 in lymphatic vasculature development is unknown. We tested the hypothesis that the swelling observed in Tie1 mutant embryos is associated with lymphatic vascular defects.

Methods and Results

We could extend the survival of the Tie1-deficient embryos in the ICR background, which allowed us to study their lymphatic vessel development. At embryonic day (E) 14.5, the Tie1(-/-) embryos had edema and hemorrhages and began to die. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that they have abnormal lymph sacs. Tie1(-/-) mutants were swollen already at E12.5 without signs of hemorrhage. Their lymph sacs were abnormally patterned, suggesting that lymphatic malformations precede the blood vascular defects. We generated mice with a conditional Cre/loxP Tie1(neo) locus and found that the homozygous Tie1(neo/neo) hypomorphic embryos survived until E15.5 with lymphatic malformations resembling those seen in the Tie1(-/-) mutants.

Conclusions

Our data show that loss of Tie1 results in lymphatic vascular abnormalities that precede the blood vessel phenotype. These findings indicate that Tie1 is involved in lymphangiogenesis and suggest differential requirements for Tie1 signaling in the two vascular compartments.

### The embryonic origins of lymphatic vessels: an historical review [^113E8A31]. British Journal of Haematology (2010). Low credibility.

Work on the lymphatic system began in the 17th century, and by the beginning of the 19th century the anatomy of most of the lymphatic system had been described. One of the most important questions in this field has been the determination of the embryological origin of the lymphatic endothelium. Two theories were proposed. The first suggested that lymphatic endothelium derived by sprouting from venous endothelium, the so-called centrifugal theory. The second, the so-called centripetal theory, suggested that lymphatic endothelium differentiates in situ from primitive mesenchyme, and secondarily acquires connection with the vascular system. More recent evidence has provided support for both hypotheses.

### Lymphatic function and anatomy in early stages of lipedema [^113jJ9L6]. Obesity (2022). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

The diagnoses of lipedema and lymphedema are often confused. Although lymphatic vessel dilation, dermal backflow, and impaired lymphatic pumping are (predictive) characteristic of acquired and congenital lymphedema, the lower extremities of individuals with Stage I and Stage II lipedema without lipolymphedema possess dilated lymphatic vessels with significantly greater lymphatic pumping than control individuals, but no dermal backflow. Our studies show that the lymphatic contributions to the etiology of lymphedema and lipedema are different and that impaired lymphatic clearance is not involved in the early progression of lipedema. The relationship of the structural changes in the lymphatic vessels of patients with lipedema requires additional study.

### Update and audit of the ST george's classification algorithm of primary lymphatic anomalies: a clinical and molecular approach to diagnosis [^111a2eJN]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2020). Medium credibility.

Primary lymphatic anomalies may present in a myriad of ways and are highly heterogenous. Careful consideration of the presentation can lead to an accurate clinical and/or molecular diagnosis which will assist with management. The most common presentation is lymphoedema, swelling resulting from failure of the peripheral lymphatic system. However, there may be internal lymphatic dysfunction, for example, chylous reflux, or lymphatic malformations, including the thorax or abdomen. A number of causal germline or postzygotic gene mutations have been discovered. Some through careful phenotyping and categorisation of the patients based on the St George's classification pathway/algorithm. The St George's classification algorithm is aimed at providing an accurate diagnosis for patients with lymphoedema based on age of onset, areas affected by swelling and associated clinical features. This has enabled the identification of new causative genes. This update brings the classification of primary lymphatic disorders in line with the International Society for the Study of Vascular Anomalies 2018 classification for vascular anomalies. The St George's algorithm considers combined vascular malformations and primary lymphatic anomalies. It divides the types of primary lymphatic anomalies into lymphatic malformations and primary lymphoedema. It further divides the primary lymphoedema into syndromic, generalised lymphatic dysplasia with internal/systemic involvement, congenital-onset lymphoedema and late-onset lymphoedema. An audit and update of the algorithm has revealed where new genes have been discovered and that a molecular diagnosis was possible in 26% of all patients overall and 41% of those tested.

### Lymphatic function and anatomy in early stages of lipedema [^1158v8cE]. Obesity (2022). Medium credibility.

Table 2 details the observations for each limb with lipedema, with sample images of observed abnormal lymphatic structure presented in Figure 1E ‐H and Figure 2. For identification purposes, each leg is identified by the individual's ID number followed by the side of the body (e.g. L12‐L refers to the left leg of individual L12). Dilated and potentially "leaky" lymphatic vessels, particularly in the medial leg as shown in Figure 1E, F (L06‐L and L05‐L), were the most commonly observed abnormality (98% of legs) in all individuals with lipedema regardless of disease stage. A distinct reduction of fluorescence in the shins compared with the feet, as shown in Figure 1G (L04), was also observed in 83% of the legs, possibly consistent with the sparing of the feet in lipedema. As lymphatic vessels transited the medial thighs (Figure 1H; L03), the fluorescence intensity often decreased further, although fluorescent lymph nodes were generally observed in the inguinal regions, consistent with functional lymphatic watersheds. The lymphatic anatomy and function in arms of individuals with lipedema appeared similar to those of control individuals.

### Physiological perspective on therapies of lymphatic vessels [^1121PYKZ]. Advances in Wound Care (2018). Low credibility.

Translational Relevance

Restricting the dose or the exposure time of VEGF-C reduces its pluripotent effect on blood vessels, the complication that limited applications of pro-lymphangiogenic therapies. A controlled administration of VEGF-Ccan also alleviate the risk of abnormal valve development within collecting lymphatics, preventing malformations that can cripple the drainage from the entire afferent lymphatic vasculature. In addition, research is revealing a growing list of variables, such as the subject's ageand the presence of inflammatory stimuli, that can influence the VEGF-C treatment. Understanding the interplay between factors involved in non-developmental remodeling of lymphatics requires the generation of animal models that permit functional distinction between lymphatic capillaries and collecting lymphatic vessels in different tissues.

### Diagnosis and management of lymphatic vascular disease [^115hGQKW]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

The lymphatic vasculature is comprised of a network of vessels that is essential both to fluid homeostasis and to the mediation of regional immune responses. In health, the lymphatic vasculature possesses the requisite transport capacity to accommodate the fluid load placed upon it. The most readily recognizable attribute of lymphatic vascular incompetence is the presence of the characteristic swelling of tissues, called lymphedema, which arises as a consequence of insufficient lymph transport. The diagnosis of lymphatic vascular disease relies heavily upon the physical examination. If the diagnosis remains in question, the presence of lymphatic vascular insufficiency can be ascertained through imaging, including indirect radionuclide lymphoscintigraphy. Beyond lymphoscintigraphy, clinically-relevant imaging modalities include magnetic resonance imaging and computerized axial tomography. The state-of-the-art therapeutic approach to lymphatic edema relies upon physiotherapeutic techniques. Complex decongestive physiotherapy is an empirically-derived, effective, multicomponent technique designed to reduce limb volume and maintain the health of the skin and supporting structures. The application of pharmacological therapies has been notably absent from the management strategies for lymphatic vascular insufficiency states. In general, drug-based approaches have been controversial at best. Surgical approaches to improve lymphatic flow through vascular reanastomosis have been, in large part, unsuccessful, but controlled liposuction affords lasting benefit in selected patients. In the future, specifically engineered molecular therapeutics may be designed to facilitate the controlled regrowth of damaged, dysfunctional, or obliterated lymphatic vasculature in order to circumvent or mitigate the vascular insufficiency that leads to edema and tissue destruction.

### Lymphatic abnormalities on magnetic resonance imaging in single-ventricle congenital heart defects before glenn operation [^116JuAo7]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Children born with single‐ventricle physiology benefit tremendously from staged palliations but are at risk of serious long‐term complications. Some complications are related to the lymphatic system. Lymphatic abnormalities and congestion are seen in the neck and thorax on T2‐weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients following Glenn operation and before Fontan operation, but an understanding of when and how these lymphatic changes occur is sparse.

The lymphatic system consists of a widespread network of lymphatic vessels throughout the body that drain and transport lymphatic fluid from the interstitial space and back into the venous system. The largest lymphatic vessels return the lymphatic fluid to the great veins of the neck and thorax. Besides maintaining fluid homeostasis by returning filtered fluid from the blood circulation and the interstitial space, the lymphatic system is involved in protein transport, lipid transport, and immune response. Increased filtration of interstitial fluid and insufficient drainage or return of lymphatic fluid may lead to lymphatic fluid accumulation.

The circulatory changes during the staged palliations adversely affect the lymphatic system, and more severe lymphatic abnormalities on noncontrast MRI imaging at the Glenn stage, correlate with worse outcomes following the Fontan operation.

In patients with a Glenn operation (superior cavopulmonary connection) the lymphatics and veins of the neck and thorax drain against a higher superior cavopulmonary connection pressure. Increased central venous pressure (CVP) in the Glenn and Fontan circulation is believed to lead to increased lymphatic production, compromised drainage, and potentially also development or opening of new anomalous lymphatic vessels. These changes may in some cases lead to chylothorax, plastic bronchitis, or protein‐losing enteropathy.,

The anomalous lymphatic vessels can be visualized on T2‐weighted MRI and categorized according to their anatomical location in the neck and thorax. Lymphatic changes on T2‐weighted MRI have been demonstrated after Glenn operation as well as following Fontan surgery, but the exact timing of the development of the anomalous lymphatic vessels is unknown, although lymphatic changes have been described as early as in utero in fetuses with cardiac defects. We investigate if lymphatic changes are already present before the Glenn operation to better understand the occurrence of these lymphatic abnormalities in children with single‐ventricle physiology.

### Physiological perspective on therapies of lymphatic vessels [^117Quvhq]. Advances in Wound Care (2018). Low credibility.

Lymphangiography, a minimally invasive functional test of lymphatic collectors, relied on injection of the tracer in the interstitium and is applicable only to live individuals or intact organs. In fixed tissues, however, the functional status of collectors can be inferred from their morphology, as outgrowth within the endothelial lining or excessive BM deposits results in lumen occlusion or valve hypertrophia, the abnormalities that can block the drainage from the entire afferent vasculature (Figs. 2 Right and 3B, C). It should be noted that tissue morphology cannot be directly retrieved from mechanically processed samples, that is, after the most common, mechanical sectioning of the tissue. Also, the presence or absence of lymphatic-associated markers such as LYVE-1 or podoplanin is heterogeneous (Fig. 4A, B) and indifferent to the function of collecting lymphatics.

Performance of capillary vessels is resistant to morphological abnormalities and cannot be inferred from capillary morphology (Figs. 2 Left and 3A). Acting at the cellular level, LYVE1 and junctional proteins, secreted chemokines, and BM components, together with the extracellular fibrilin anchoring filaments, determine the permeability and immune-related properties of lymphatic capillaries. In contrast to collectors, functional parameters of capillary lymphatics could not be directly assessed in vivo with a method such as a lymphangiography as the non-physiological pressure of injection artificially forces particles or cells into lymphatics. However, combining implantation models with an intravital imaging technique, we showed that morphologically abnormal hyperplastic capillaries perform two of their primary functions, draining macromolecules and attracting DCs and assisting in their intravasation.

### Life-threatening anomalies of the thoracic duct: anatomic delineation dictates management [^112XKbJq]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

Congenital anomalies of the thoracic duct are rare, poorly characterized, and difficult to manage. The spectrum of pathophysiologic perturbations, presenting symptoms, radiographic findings, and interventions performed in 4 patients are shown. Accurate anatomic delineation of the malformation was only possible by direct injection contrast lymphangiography. Therapies tailored to address the anatomic aberrations included intralesional sclerotherapy, surgical excision and ligation, lymphovenous anastomosis, and omental interposition to interrupt dysfunctional collateral lymphatics to the lung. Accurate anatomic diagnosis of central lymphatic channel anomalies by contrast lymphangiography facilitates an individualized multidisciplinary approach to repair.

### Lymphedema [^116SzyMM]. The American Journal of Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Lymphedema is a set of pathologic conditions that are characterized by the regional accumulation of excessive amounts of interstitial protein-rich fluid. These occur as a result of an imbalance between the demand for lymphatic flow and the capacity of the lymphatic circulation. Lymphedema can result from either primary or acquired (secondary) disorders. In this review, the pathophysiology, classification, natural history, differential diagnosis, and treatment of lymphedema are discussed.

Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2023). High credibility.

Chronic venous disorder terminology states that chronic venous disorders include the full spectrum of morphologic and functional abnormalities of the venous system; chronic venous disease refers to morphologic and functional abnormalities of the venous system of long duration manifested by symptoms or signs, or both, indicating need for investigation and/or care; chronic venous insufficiency is reserved for advanced chronic venous disease (CEAP class C3-C6) applied to functional abnormalities of the venous system producing edema, skin changes, or venous ulcers.

### Lymphatic anomalies in children: update on imaging diagnosis, genetics, and treatment [^116xMPnX]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2022). Medium credibility.

Lymphatic anomalies comprise a spectrum of disorders ranging from common localized microcystic and macrocystic lymphatic malformations (LMs) to rare complex lymphatic anomalies, including generalized lymphatic anomaly, Kaposiform lymph-angiomatosis, central conducting lymphatic anomaly, and Gorham-Stout disease. Imaging diagnosis of cystic LMs is generally straightforward, but complex lymphatic anomalies, particularly those with multiorgan involvement or diffuse disease, may be more challenging to diagnose. Complex lymphatic anomalies are rare but associated with high morbidity. Imaging plays an important role in their diagnosis, and radiologists may be the first clinicians to suggest the diagnosis. Furthermore, radiologists are regularly involved in management given the frequent need for image-guided interventions. For these reasons, it is crucial for radiologists to be familiar with the spectrum of entities comprising complex lymphatic anomalies and their typical imaging findings. In this article, we review the imaging findings of lymphatic anomalies, including LMs and complex lymphatic anomalies. We discuss characteristic imaging findings, multimodality imaging techniques used for evaluation, pearls and pitfalls in diagnosis, and potential complications. We also review recently discovered genetic changes underlying lymphatic anomaly development and the advent of new molecularly targeted therapies.

### MR lymphangiography in children: technique and potential applications [^113J1KkT]. Radiographics (2017). Low credibility.

The lymphatic system, an important component of the circulatory system with essential physiologic functions, can be affected by various disease processes. There has been a delay in the development of effective imaging methods for the lymphatic system due to its small size, which limits visualization as well as introduction of contrast material. Traditionally, the lymphatic system has been imaged by injecting contrast material or radiotracers into the feet or hands. This is not sufficient for assessment of the central conducting lymphatics (CCLs) (such as the thoracic duct or the cisterna chyli). Fluoroscopic intranodal lymphangiography with injection of oil-based contrast material into groin lymph nodes improves visualization of CCLs but is limited in practice owing to the use of radiation and the potential risk for paradoxical embolization in children with left-to-right shunt. Dynamic contrast material-enhanced (DCE) magnetic resonance (MR) lymphangiography, which is performed by injecting gadolinium-based contrast material into groin lymph nodes, overcomes these limitations. T2-weighted imaging plays a complementary role to DCE MR lymphangiography in the assessment of CCLs. DCE MR lymphangiography demonstrates preserved integrity or any abnormality of the CCLs (including blockage or leak). The technique has recently been used in evaluating pulmonary lymphatic perfusion syndrome in children with plastic bronchitis, neonatal lymphatic flow disorders, and nontraumatic chylothorax. It is useful in identification of the source of chylous ascites and contributes to understanding of the anatomy of lymphatic malformations. It is successfully used for planning of embolization of aberrant lymphatic channels in a variety of lymphatic flow disorders. This review discusses the anatomy and function of the lymphatic system, the evolution of imaging of the lymphatic system, and DCE MR lymphangiography technique and its applications in children. © RSNA, 2017.

### Imaging findings of thoracic lymphatic abnormalities [^112ovt5X]. Radiographics (2022). Medium credibility.

The lymphatic system plays an important role in balancing fluid compartments in the body. It is disrupted by various disease processes in the thorax, including injury to the thoracic lymphatic duct after surgery, as well as malignancy and heart failure. Because of the small size of lymphatic vessels, imaging of the lymphatics is relatively difficult, and effective imaging methods are still being optimized and developed. The standard of reference for lymphatic imaging has been conventional lymphangiography for several decades. Other modalities such as CT, noncontrast or contrast-enhanced MRI, and lymphoscintigraphy can also demonstrate lymphatic abnormalities and help in treatment planning. Imaging findings associated with lymphatic abnormalities can be seen in the pulmonary parenchyma, pleural space, and mediastinum. In the pulmonary parenchyma, common findings include interlobular septal thickening as well as reversal of lymphatic flow with intravasation of contrast material into pulmonary lymphatics. In the pleural space, findings include chylous pleural effusion and occasionally nonchylous pleural effusion. In the mediastinum, thoracic duct leak, plexiform thoracic duct, lymphatic malformations, and lymphangiectasis may occur. Management of chylothorax includes conservative or medical treatment, surgery, and interventional radiology procedures. The authors discuss thoracic lymphatic anatomy, imaging manifestations of lymphatic abnormalities in the various anatomic compartments, and interventional radiology treatment of chylothorax. Radiologists should be familiar with these imaging findings for diagnosis and to help guide appropriate management. © RSNA, 2022.

### Liver lymphatic anatomy and role in systemic lymphatic disease [^113EfJSk]. European Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

We identified five different imaging categories that demonstrated a substantial correlation to presenting systemic lymphatic disease. The presence of abnormal imaging patterns correlated with increased morbidity of their disease and warrants further investigation. Liver lymphatics should be evaluated in all patients with a systemic lymphatic disease if central lymphatic imaging is normal.

### Components of the lymphatic system-SEER training modules… [^111vFkZm]. training.seer.cancer.gov (2025). Medium credibility.

Components of the Lymphatic System The lymphatic system consists of a fluid, vessels that transport the lymph, and organs that contain lymphoid tissue. Lymphatic Vessels Lymphatic vessels, unlike blood vessels, only carry fluid away from the tissues. The smallest lymphatic vessels are the lymph capillaries, which begin in the tissue spaces as blind-ended sacs. Lymph capillaries are found in all regions of the body except the bone marrow, central nervous system, and tissues, such as the epidermis, that lack blood vessels. The wall of the lymph capillary is composed of endothelium in which the simple squamous cells overlap to form a simple one-way valve. This arrangement permits fluid to enter the capillary but prevents lymph from leaving the vessel. The microscopic lymph capillaries merge to form lymphatic vessels. Small lymphatic vessels join to form larger tributaries, called lymphatic trunks, which drain large regions.

Lymphatic trunks merge until the lymph enters the two lymphatic ducts. The right lymphatic duct drains lymph from the upper right quadrant of the body. The thoracic duct drains all the rest. Like veins, the lymphatic tributaries have thin walls and have valves to prevent backflow of blood. There is no pump in the lymphatic system like the heart in the cardiovascular system. The pressure gradients to move lymph through the vessels come from the skeletal muscle action, respiratory movement, and contraction of smooth muscle in vessel walls. Lymphatic Organs Lymphatic organs are characterized by clusters of lymphocytes and other cells, such as macrophages, enmeshed in a framework of short, branching connective tissue fibers. The lymphocytes originate in the red bone marrow with other types of blood cells and are carried in the blood from the bone marrow to the lymphatic organs.

When the body is exposed to microorganisms and other foreign substances, the lymphocytes proliferate within the lymphatic organs and are sent in the blood to the site of the invasion. This is part of the immune response that attempts to destroy the invading agent. The lymphatic organs include:

### Targeting the lymphatic system for interstitial decongestion [^113ceVSS]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2021). Medium credibility.

Clearly, additional studies are necessary to determine the clinical utility of such a device because numerous factors remain unknown. For instance, 1) the device does not tackle alterations happening in the interstitium (eg, disruption of GAG function with disruption of electrostatic function and high P IF) and the microcirculation (eg, low K f with poor plasma refilling) contributing to ongoing interstitial volume overload; 2) success in clinical practice might be variable because of the variable anatomy of the thoracic duct; 3) in tackling total body volume overload, the effect is unknown because the thoracic duct handles only approximately 15% to 20% of all lymph transudate; and 4) the device as designed only works temporarily, and it is unknown if this will be sufficient for a clinically relevant impact if altered anatomy and functioning of lymph vessels persists after device discontinuation. Nevertheless, the authors should be congratulated for this innovative technology that has rejuvenated interest in a relatively understudied field in heart failure, namely, the intersection between the microcirculation, interstitium, and lymphatic system.

Although the process of blood vasculature formation has been well documented, little is known about lymphatic vasculature development, despite its importance in normal and pathological conditions. The lack of specific lymphatic markers has hampered progress in this field. However, the recent identification of genes that participate in the formation of the lymphatic vasculature denotes the beginning of a new era in which better diagnoses and therapeutic treatment(s) of lymphatic disorders could become a reachable goal.

### Cardiac lymphatic insufficiency leads to diastolic dysfunction via myocardial morphologic change [^111QUyKC]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2023). Medium credibility.

Although cardiac lymphatic vessels have received increasing attention in recent years, there is still a knowledge gap between cardiac lymphatics and heart homeostasis in a normal heart. In the present study, we established a mouse model of cardiac lymphatic insufficiency ablating cardiac lymphatic collector vessels to reveal the crucial role of cardiac lymphatic vessels in maintaining cardiac homeostasis and the impact on cardiac function both in physiological and pathologic settings. Furthermore, therapeutic lymphangiogenesis improved the adverse effect on cardiac morphologic changes and functions. These findings suggest that the cardiac lymphatic system would be a novel therapeutic target for heart disease.

### Lymphatic malformations: current cellular and clinical investigations [^1177Lonm]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

Summarize current knowledge of lymphatic malformation development, biology, and clinical outcome measures.

Methods

Panel presentation of lymphatic malformation biology and measurement of head and neck malformation treatment outcomes.

Results

Characterization of lymphatic malformation endothelial and stromal cells may lead to biologically based treatment. Traditionally, lymphatic malformation treatment outcomes have been measured according to reduction of malformation size. Currently, methods to measure functional outcomes following lymphatic malformation treatment are lacking. This is particularly apparent when the malformation directly involves the upper aerodigestive tract.

Conclusions

The etiology and pathogenesis of head and neck lymphatic malformations are poorly understood, but understanding is improving through ongoing investigation. Reduction of lymphatic malformation size is generally possible, but further work is necessary to optimize methods for measuring therapeutic outcomes in problematic areas.

### Imaging of fetal lymphangiectasias: prenatal and postnatal imaging findings [^113jb5eS]. Pediatric Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Lymphangiectasias are lymphatic malformations characterized by the abnormal dilation and morphology of the lymphatic channels. The classification and treatment of these disorders can be challenging given the limited amount of literature available in children. Various imaging modalities are used to confirm suspected diagnosis, plan the most appropriate treatment, and estimate a prognosis. Prenatal evaluation is performed using both prenatal US imaging and fetal MRI. These modalities are paramount for appropriate parental counseling and planning of perinatal care. During the neonatal period, chest US imaging is a useful modality to evaluate pulmonary lymphangiectasia because other modalities such as conventional radiography and CT display nonspecific findings. Finally, the recent breakthroughs in lymphatic imaging with MRI have allowed us to better classify lymphatic disorders. Dynamic contrast-enhanced lymphangiography, conventional lymphangiography and percutaneous lymphatic procedures offer static and dynamic evaluation of the central conducting lymphatics in children, with excellent spatial resolution and the possibility to provide treatment. The purpose of this review is to discuss the normal and abnormal development of the fetal lymphatic system and how to best depict it by imaging during the prenatal and postnatal life.

### Generalized lymphatic anomaly and gorham-stout disease: overview and recent insights [^117EydHp]. Advances in Wound Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Scope and Significance

Generalized lymphatic anomaly(GLA), Gorham–Stout disease, (GSD), Kaposiform lymphangiomatosis(KLA), and channel-type lymphatic malformations (LMs) are classified according to their pathology(Table 1); however, some disease forms with differing pathologies are not separately defined entities. Furthermore, central conducting lymphatic anomaly (CCLA), a channel-type LM, with unclear etiology, might represent a spectrum of lymphatic pathologies. Because clinical findings overlap, and disease etiology, management, outcomes, and sequelae are unclear, intractable LMs (termed complex lymphatic anomalies [CLAs])are difficult to diagnose. We review recent studies reporting different clinical characteristics of vascular anomalies to further understand their pathogenesis and optimal treatment.

### Imaging the lymphatic system: possibilities and clinical applications [^111cM4dF]. European Radiology (2004). Low credibility.

The lymphatic system is anatomically complex and difficult to image. Lymph ducts are responsible for the drainage of part of the body's interstitial fluid. Lymph nodes account for the enrichment of lymph fluid, and can be involved in a large variety of diseases, especially cancer. For a long time, lymphatic imaging was limited to the sole use of conventional lymphography involving invasive procedures and patient discomfort. New contrast agents and techniques in ultrasound, nuclear medicine, and MR imaging are now available for imaging of both the lymphatic vessels and the lymph nodes. The objective of this review is to discuss the different imaging modalities of the lymphatic system, with a special focus on the new possibilities of lymphatic imaging including enhanced MR lymphography, sentinel node and positron emission tomography imaging, and contrast-enhanced ultrasound.

### Advances in understanding and examining lymphatic function: relevance for understanding autoimmunity [^113DqR7G]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The aim of this review is to give insights into how novel lymphatics functions may influence autoimmunity.

Recent Findings

The lymphatic system connects peripheral tissues to draining lymph nodes to regulate adaptive immunity and directly interfaces with leukocytes in lymph vessels and in the lymph node. Here, we discuss recent findings showing evidence of dysfunctional lymphatics in autoimmune disease, new understanding of how afferent lymphatic regulation can modulate immunity, lymph node lymphatic heterogeneity and how these lymphatics can directly modulate lymphocyte function, how this understanding can be harnessed for new therapeutics, and new tools for the investigation of lymphatic and immune biology.

Summary

Lymphatics have an active role in the regulation of inflammation and the adaptive immune response. Here, we review recent findings in lymphatics biology in peripheral tissues and lymph nodes and emphasize the relevance for better understanding autoimmune diseases.

### Prognostic value of a simplified anatomically based nomenclature for fetal nuchal lymphatic anomalies [^113TWp7S]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To propose an anatomic classification for fetal nuchal lymphatic anomalies that will be clinically useful and to evaluate the classification's value in predicting chromosomal abnormalities, pregnancy outcomes, other associated fetal anomalies, and spontaneous resolution of these lesions.

Study Design

Retrospective cohort study.

Setting

Tertiary academic hospital and affiliated tertiary children's hospital.

Subjects and Methods

Mother-baby pairs diagnosed with fetal nuchal lymphatic anomalies in a prenatal ultrasound database. Anomalies were classified as nuchal thickening, dorsal lymphatic malformation, or ventral lymphatic malformation. Pregnancy outcomes, prevalence of chromosomal and anatomic abnormalities, and rates of spontaneous lesion resolution were determined for each group.

Results

The study included 189 patients: 58 with nuchal thickening, 120 with dorsal lymphatic malformation, and 11 with ventral lymphatic malformation. In fetuses for whom chromosomal analysis was available, chromosomal abnormalities were strongly associated with dorsal lymphatic malformations (83%), less associated with nuchal thickening (29%), and not associated with ventral lymphatic malformations. Dorsal lymphatic malformation predicted high rates of elective (43%) and spontaneous (20%) termination of pregnancy and showed the strongest association with cardiac, renal, and skeletal anomalies. Nuchal thickening was more likely to resolve in utero than dorsal lymphatic malformations, while no ventral lymphatic malformation resolved spontaneously.

Conclusions

Fetal nuchal anomalies demonstrate significant and clinically important prognostic differences depending on their anatomic location. The simple classification system proposed here therefore provides useful information to clinicians involved in the pre- and postnatal management of children with these anomalies.

### Physiological perspective on therapies of lymphatic vessels [^112REzus]. Advances in Wound Care (2018). Low credibility.

In addition to the junctional arrangement at the cellular level, the function of lymphatic collectors depends on the higher-level organization through cooperation among numerous endothelial cells (Fig. 1, Right). The endothelium of collectors forms zipper-like junctions that seal the space between cells and limit vessel permeability. Intraluminal funnel-like valves with circumferential cuspid determine the direction of flow between capillary and pre-collecting lymphatic vessels. Bicuspid valves are present at every lymphatic bifurcation in larger collecting vessels, and along the pre-nodal nonbranching lymphatic collectors, where they outline lymphangions, the contractile units of collecting vessels. BM mechanically reinforces valve cuspids but also delineates the bulging morphology of post-valve sinuses. Sinuses help sustain the backflow during retrograde lymph movement by shifting a hydrostatic force laterally toward valve cuspids, facilitating closure of valves as soon as the pressure in efferent vessels dominates. Cuspids and sinuses of a funnel or bicuspid valves amount to the most characteristic morphological features of the lymphatic collecting vessels, that are recognizable under a stereomicroscope in live, unstained tissue and even as decellularized casts of BM.

Discussed in detail in the following section, a therapeutic induction of post-developmental lymphatic remodeling comes with the risk of excessive stimulation of targeted cells that leads to their hyperplastic outgrowth. Even though unlike neoplasms, hyperplastic cells preserve their lineage-specific properties, changes to the tissue architecture could jeopardize its morphology-dependent properties. The hyperplastic growth of capillary endothelium poses a minimal threat to the capillary function as, despite spectacular morphological abnormalities, their function is determined at the cellular and intracellular levels (Figs. 2 Left panel and 3A). Therefore, hyperplastic capillaries should remain functional as long as individual cells preserve their physiological properties. To the contrary, excessive proliferation of endothelium within valves or lumen of collecting lymphatics could be detrimental for the unidirectionality of lymph flow and entirely block the drainage from the afferent tissue (Figs. 2 Right and 3B, C). Indeed, abnormal valve development is responsible for the insufficient lymph transport in hereditary lymphedema distichiasisand for the reversed lymph flow from solid tumors. Therefore, in sharp opposition to capillary lymphatics, morphological features of lymphatic collectors are indispensable for their functionality. Any abnormalities in cell arrangement or organization of their BM reflect the functional state of collectors that could serve as an indicator of their physiological status (Figs. 2 and 3).

### Lymphedema: pathophysiology and clinical manifestations [^116gpPru]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Lymphedema is a localized form of tissue swelling resulting from excessive retention of lymphatic fluid in the interstitial compartment and caused by impaired lymphatic drainage. Lymphedema is classified as primary or secondary. Primary lymphedema is caused by developmental lymphatic vascular anomalies. Secondary lymphedema is acquired and arises as a result of an underlying systemic disease, trauma, or surgery. We performed PubMed and Google Scholar searches of the English-language literature (1966–2017) using the terms lymphedema, cancer-related lymphedema, and lymphatic complications. Relevant publications were manually reviewed for additional resources. This progressive chronic disease has serious implications on patients' quality of life. It is often misdiagnosed because it mimics other conditions of extremity swelling. There is no definitive cure for lymphedema. However, with proper diagnosis and management, its progression and potential complications may be limited.

Figure 2.
Hypothetical results of hyperplasia on the function of capillaries and collecting lymphatics. Left panel: The function of capillary lymphatics is determined at the cellular level. Despite abnormal morphology, hyperplastic capillaries remain functional as long as individual cells preserve their properties. A pre-requisite for the formation of a vessel, cell-cell junctions between endothelial cells, allows seclusion of the lumen by the intact monolayer of endothelial cells. Independently of vessel morphology, for the new capillary to remain functional, endothelial cells must secrete leukocyte chemoattractants, such as the CCL21 chemokine, to assist in leukocyte intravasation and preserve button-like morphology of primary valves. Right panel: The unidirectional lymph drainage along the collecting lymphatic depends on a structural organization of vessels and can be compromised even when individual cells preserve their properties. Hyperplasia affects the anatomical organization of multicellular structures and leads to the structural abnormalities in most hypothetical scenarios: drainage occlusion (intralymphatic proliferation), valve insufficiency and lymph backflow (valve remodeling), drainage block (formation of valves opposing the normal direction of lymph flow), lymph stasis, clotting, fibrosis (lymphangiectasia), and lymph leakage to the interstitium (increased permeability of endothelium). Also, in contrast to lymphatic capillaries, a single morphological aberration within lymphatic collectors may result in dysfunctionality of the entire afferent lymphatic drainage system.

### Bringing to light the invisible lymphatic anatomy of the upper extremity: report from the 2024 harvard radcliffe institute accelerator workshop [^115BgNfD]. Annals of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To identify vulnerable upper extremity regions in native lymphatic anatomy that predispose women to the development of breast cancer-related lymphedema. Additionally, to identify currently available imaging technologies that could be repurposed for in-vivo lymphatic imaging of these anatomic regions and pathways.

Background

Breast cancer-related lymphedema remains an incurable complication of breast cancer treatment, but improvements to knowledge of upper extremity lymphatic anatomy and imaging can unlock new techniques for prevention and treatment.

Methods

"Bringing to Light the Invisible Lymphatic Anatomy of the Human Body" was a two day accelerator workshop held in May 2024 at the Harvard Radcliffe Institute attended by sixteen experts in lymphatic anatomy and imaging including four lymphatic anatomists, five imaging clinicians, three lymphatic scientists, and three program officers from the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) and Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H).

Results

Collateral pathways of the superficial lymphatic system, perforating lymphatic vessels, and the deep lymphatic system were implicated in preventing or reducing the severity of BCRL. Several strategies were proposed for repurposing existing imaging technology and developing new imaging technology that can improve understanding of the anatomy, function, and connectivity of lymphatic vessels in these three regions of the arm.

Conclusion

Advancements in lymphatic imaging are central to refining our knowledge of lymphatic anatomy. Key challenges to lymphatic imaging are visualization of the deep lymphatic system and perforating lymphatic vessels.

### Introduction to the lymphatic system-SEER training modules… [^115jAWV8]. training.seer.cancer.gov (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction to the Lymphatic System The lymphatic system has three primary functions. First of all, it returns excess interstitial fluid to the blood. Of the fluid that leaves the capillary, about 90 percent is returned. The 10 percent that does not return becomes part of the interstitial fluid that surrounds the tissue cells. Small protein molecules may "leak" through the capillary wall and increase the osmotic pressure of the interstitial fluid. This further inhibits the return of fluid into the capillaries, and fluid tends to accumulate in the tissue spaces. If this continues, blood volume and blood pressure decrease significantly and the volume of tissue fluid increases, which results in edema. Lymph capillaries pick up the excess interstitial fluid and proteins and return them to the venous blood. After the fluid enters the lymph capillaries, it is called lymph.

The second function of the lymphatic system is the absorption of fats and fat-soluble vitamins from the digestive system and the subsequent transport of these substances to the venous circulation. The mucosa that lines the small intestine is covered with fingerlike projections called villi. There are blood capillaries and special lymph capillaries, called lacteals, in the center of each villus. The blood capillaries absorb most nutrients, but the fats and fat-soluble vitamins are absorbed by the lacteals. The lymph in the lacteals has a milky appearance due to its high fat content and is called chyle. The third and probably most well known function of the lymphatic system is defense against invading microorganisms and disease. Lymph nodes and other lymphatic organs filter the lymph to remove microorganisms and other foreign particles. Lymphatic organs contain lymphocytes that destroy invading organisms.

### Molecular and metabolic orchestration of the lymphatic vasculature in physiology and pathology [^1167DMqP]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

The lymphatic system is comprised of an open, unidirectional, and low-pressure network of lymphatic vessels, along with primary and secondary lymphoid organs, such as spleen, thymus and lymph nodes –. It maintains the interstitial fluid volume and composition for tissue homeostasis, participates in the intestinal absorption of dietary fats and vitamins, and is essential for immunosurveillance and immunomodulation. The formation of the lymphatic network from the preexisting vasculature is a highly controlled process termed lymphangiogenesis –. Despite being crucially active during embryogenesis, lymphatic growth in adult tissues is limited to particular circumstances and locations, including the female reproductive cycle, wound healing and pathological events like tumors and inflammation. Moreover, impaired lymphatic formation and function also contributes to lymphedema progression. Although most of the studies on lymphatic dysfunction have focused on cancer and lymphedema, lymphatics have been recently associated with neurological and neurodegenerative disorders, inflammatory bowel disease, cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome and glaucoma.

All throughout the lymphatic system, lymphatic vessels are lined by lymphatic endothelial cells (LEC), which are endothelial cells (EC) displaying specific transcriptional, molecular and metabolic programs accountable for the lymphatic system's many and essential functions. The morphology of lymphatic vessels is often uniquely tied with their distinct functions and sizes. The most basic constituent of the lymphatic vasculature are lymphatic capillaries, which are highly permeable structures, formed exclusively by a monolayer of discontinuously linked LECs. Due to their structure, lymphatic capillaries allow for the filtration of interstitial fluid and the formation of lymph. Lymph is then transported to larger vascular structures named pre-collecting and collecting vessels, which are composed of a continuous, airtight monolayer of LECs, covered with specialized smooth muscle cells (SMC). SMCs not only guarantee the flow of lymph and its unidirectionality, but also participate in the morphogenesis of the lymphatic system. On the other hand, SMC contractile activity depends on the physical, biochemical, and immunological signals from the environment, such as nitric oxide (NO) synthesized by the endothelium.

Statistical Analysis

Demographic, clinical, operative, and outcome variables were reported using descriptive statistics. Means/SDs are reported for normal continuous variables, medians with interquartile ranges are reported for nonnormal continuous variables, and counts with percentages are reported for categorical variables.

Mann‐Whitney U, χ², and Fisher's exact tests were used for bivariate associations, with a 2‐tailed P < 0.05. Odds ratios are reported for the association between lymphatic abnormality type and outcomes.

Sensitivity analyses were performed with the 12 patients who met criteria for the primary outcome because of non–Fontan‐related reasons. After removing them from the "early complications" group, the results remained the same. Consequently, the results are presented with those 12 patients removed from the cohort. To address potential bias from T2 imaging that was obtained inconsistently during the first 2 years of the study, additional associations between availability of lymphatic imaging and development of early complications were performed.

### Current and developing lymphatic imaging approaches for elucidation of functional mechanisms and disease progression [^116hZp3t]. Molecular Imaging and Biology (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Despite many recent and ongoing discoveries concerning the lymphatic system, the field remains ripe for further exploration, with respect to fundamental understanding of lymphatic architecture and physiology as well as the role of the lymphatics in various pathologies. Imaging is a crucial tool in bolstering this progress, and so the development of novel contrast agents and imaging tools remains of the utmost importance. Using new platforms, such as nanoparticles with multimodal imaging capabilities, could allow researchers and clinicians to extract greater information while also streamlining experimental procedures. While these new technologies have already begun to demonstrate their effectiveness, additional work is necessary to validate their efficacy in comparison to more traditional methods and ensure thorough translation to clinical settings.

### Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance lymphangiography [^114A3sF5]. Pediatric Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Lymphatic flow disorders include a broad spectrum of abnormalities that can originate in the lymphatic or the venous system. The development of these disorders is multifactorial and is most commonly associated with congenital heart diseases and palliative surgeries that these patients undergo. Central lymphatic disorders might be secondary to traumatic leaks, lymphatic overproduction, conduction abnormalities or lymphedema, and they can progress to perfusion anomalies. Several imaging modalities have been used to visualize the lymphatic system. However, the imaging of central lymphatic flow has always been challenging. Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance lymphangiography (DCMRL) allows for visualization of central lymphatic flow disorders and has been recently applied for the assessment of plastic bronchitis, protein-losing enteropathy, chylothorax and chylopericardium, among other lymphatic disorders. The hepatic and mesenteric accesses are innovative and promising techniques for better identification and understanding of these abnormalities. The main objectives of this review are to discuss the physiology and anatomy of the lymphatic system and review the current uses of DCMRL in the diagnosis and management of lymphatic flow disorders.

### Novel lymphatic imaging techniques [^116oN9PN]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

The lymphatic system plays an important role in immune regulation, transport of metabolites, and fluid balance. The key circulatory role of the lymphatic system is to transport fluid from tissue back into the venous system via lymphovenous connections. Despite the centuries-old recognition of this key role, there has been poor understanding of lymphatic flow pathophysiology because of a lack of a simple reliable noninvasive clinical lymphatic imaging method. This lack of clinical imaging has limited the treatment options for patients with lymphatic flow disorders. Recent development of noncontrast magnetic resonance (MR) lymphangiogram and dynamic contrast MR lymphangiography make it possible to visualize central lymphatic anatomy and flow dynamics with high spatial and temporal resolution. Dynamic contrast MR lymphangiography has provided insight into understanding the pathophysiology of several pulmonary lymphatic flow disorders and provides guidance for interventional procedures. Another important development has been intranodal lymphangiogram, which has now replaced pedal lymphangiogram as the main lymphatic interventional modality, and which provides quick and reliable access to the central lymphatic ducts for interventional procedures. These new techniques have led to a resurgence in interest in the lymphatic system and the development of new treatments for patients with lymphatic flow disorders.

### Lymphatic system… [^112BDwmh]. training.seer.cancer.gov (2025). Medium credibility.

Lymphatic System The major components of the lymphatic system are lymphatic vessels, lymph, lymph nodes, and some other lymphatic organs. Lymphatic vessels carry lymph, a colorless liquid, throughout the body. Along lymph vessels are small bean-shaped glandular nodules called lymph nodes. Other lymphatic organs are:

- **Tonsil**: clusters of lymphatic tissues just under the mucous membranes that line the nose, mouth, and pharynx.
- **Spleen**: it is similar to a lymph node in shape and structure but it is much larger.
- **Thymus**: a soft organ with two lobes that is located anterior to the ascending aorta and posterior to the sternum.
- **Peyer patch**: lymphoid tissue on the visceral surface of the small intestine.

### Lymph node imaging: basic principles [^113nygiP]. European Journal of Radiology (2006). Low credibility.

Lymph nodes are involved in a wide variety of diseases, particularly in cancer. In the latter, precise nodal staging is essential to guide therapeutic options and to determine prognosis. For long, imaging of the lymphatic system has been limited to lymph vessel, especially via the exclusive use of conventional lymphography, at the expense of invasive procedures and patient's discomfort. Three main technical advances, however, have recently completed the clinical armamentarium for lymph node imaging: first, the refinement of cross sectional imaging, i.e. CT and MRI, combined or not with dedicated contrast agents, has progressively replaced conventional lymphography in oncology situations; second, the development of intra-operative sentinel node mapping has profoundly modified the diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in several cancer situations, mostly melanoma and breast cancer; finally, the increased availability of functional imaging, especially through the use of FDG-PET, has greatly contributed to the accuracy improvement of nodal metastases identification. The aim of this review will thus be to briefly review the anatomy and physiology of the lymphatic systems and to overview the basic principles of up-to-date lymph node imaging.

### The lymphatic vasculature in disease [^114mBahf]. Nature Medicine (2011). Excellent credibility.

Blood vessels form a closed circulatory system, whereas lymphatic vessels form a one-way conduit for tissue fluid and leukocytes. In most vertebrates, the main function of lymphatic vessels is to collect excess protein-rich fluid that has extravasated from blood vessels and transport it back into the blood circulation. Lymphatic vessels have an important immune surveillance function, as they import various antigens and activated antigen-presenting cells into the lymph nodes and export immune effector cells and humoral response factors into the blood circulation. Defects in lymphatic function can lead to lymph accumulation in tissues, dampened immune responses, connective tissue and fat accumulation, and tissue swelling known as lymphedema. This review highlights the most recent developments in lymphatic biology and how the lymphatic system contributes to the pathogenesis of various diseases involving immune and inflammatory responses and its role in disseminating tumor cells.

### Understanding lymphatic anatomy and abnormalities at imaging [^116TBMw4]. Radiographics (2022). Medium credibility.

Lymphatic abnormalities encompass a wide range of disorders spanning solitary common cystic lymphatic malformations (LMs) to entities involving multiple organ systems such as lymphangioleiomyomatosis. Many of these disorders are rare, yet some, such as secondary lymphedema from the treatment of malignancy (radiation therapy and/or lymph node dissection), affect millions of patients worldwide. Owing to complex and variable anatomy, the lymphatics are not as well understood as other organ systems. Further complicating this is the variability in the description of lymphatic disease processes and their nomenclature in the medical literature. In recent years, medical imaging has begun to facilitate a deeper understanding of the physiology and pathologic processes that involve the lymphatic system. Radiology is playing an important and growing role in the diagnosis and treatment of many lymphatic conditions. The authors describe both normal and common variant lymphatic anatomy. Various imaging modalities including nuclear medicine lymphoscintigraphy, conventional lymphangiography, and MR lymphangiography used in the diagnosis and treatment of lymphatic disorders are highlighted. The authors discuss imaging many of the common and uncommon lymphatic disorders, including primary LMs described by the International Society for the Study of Vascular Anomalies 2018 classification system (microcystic, mixed, and macrocystic LMs; primary lymphedema). Secondary central lymphatic disorders are also detailed, including secondary lymphedema and chylous leaks, as well as lymphatic disorders not otherwise easily classified. The authors aim to provide the reader with an overview of the anatomy, pathology, imaging findings, and treatment of a wide variety of lymphatic conditions. © RSNA, 2022.

In all patients with a lymphatic dysfunction, cardiac evaluation, including cardiac catheterization, should be performed to determine whether there are reversible cardiac causes that could be treated, such as pulmonary artery stenosis or superior vena cava obstruction. Medical and conservative treatments should also be optimized.

Lymphatic interventions can be divided into those meant to decompress the lymphatic system, such as lymphovenous anastomosis and percutaneous or surgical innominate vein (InV) turn-down, and those that are meant to reroute lymphatic flow away from abnormal lymphatic networks, such as selective lymphatic duct embolization (SLDE) or TD embolization. The decision on the therapeutic approach depends on the underlying disease and lymphatic anatomy. SLDE is the preferred interventional approach, as it maintains TD patency and flow, preserving the option of TD-decompression procedures. This is especially important in patients with multicompartment lymphatic failure or those with thoracic abnormalities and concerning findings on intrahepatic DCMRL, such as duodenal perfusion or leak. Complete TD embolization should be reserved for cases in which the TD outlet is occluded and lymphovenous anastomosis is not an option, there are multiple decompressing vessels connecting to the TD (making SLDE impossible), the TD is not fully formed, or when the patient is unstable and emergent closure of TD flow is needed.

### Classification of lymphatic-system malformations in primary lymphoedema based on MR lymphangiography [^116WdmuY]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

The study aims to investigate lymphatic-system malformations and proposes a classification of primary lymphoedema based on comprehensive imaging data of both lymph vessel- and lymph-node abnormalities.

Materials and Methods

A total of 378 patients with primary lymphoedema of the lower extremity were examined with magnetic resonance lymphangiography (MRL) using gadobenate dimeglumine as contrast agent. Lymph vessels and drainage lymph nodes were evaluated, leading to the proposal of the classification of primary lymphoedema and the relative proportions.

Results

A total of 63 (17%) patients exhibited defects of the inguinal lymph nodes with mild or moderate dilatation of afferent lymph vessels. A total of 123 (32%) patients exhibited lymphatic anomalies as lymphatic aplasia, hypoplasia or hyperplasia with no obvious defect of the drainage lymph nodes. The involvement of both lymph vessel- and lymph-node abnormalities in the affected limb was found in 192 (51%) patients. The primary lymphoedema was classified as three major types as: (1) lymph nodes affected only; (2) lymph vessel affected only with three subtypes and (3) both lymph vessel and lymph node affected with subgroups.

Conclusions

A comprehensive classification of lymphatic-system malformation in primary lymphoedema is proposed, which clearly defines the location and pathologic characteristics of both lymphatics and lymph node and may lead to further study of the aetiology as well as rational treatment of the disease.

### Complex lymphatic anomalies and therapeutic options [^114j6yvk]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Complex lymphatic anomalies include a variety of disorders with overlapping clinical, histological and imaging features. The often-confusing nomenclature used for lymphatic anomalies limits timely diagnosis and treatment. The updated 2018 classification of the International Society for the Study of Vascular Anomalies divides lymphatic anomalies into several subsets. 1 Newer imaging techniques including intranodal and magnetic resonance lymphangiography have improved our understanding of anatomy and function of the lymphatic system. Advances in medical, interventional, and surgical treatments have opened a realm of new therapeutic options for patients with complex lymphatic disorders.

Over the past several centuries, the integration of contemporary medical techniques and innovative technologies, like genetic sequencing, have played a pivotal role in enhancing our comprehension of congenital vascular and lymphatic disorders. Nonetheless, the uncommon and complex characteristics of these disorders, especially considering their formation during the intrauterine stage, present significant obstacles in diagnosis and treatment. Here, we review the intricacies of these congenital abnormalities, offering an in-depth examination of key diagnostic approaches, genetic factors, and therapeutic methods.

### Lymphatic malformations involving the thorax in children: a retrospective cohort study [^114UjgBx]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Lymphatic malformations (LMs) are a group of diseases characterized by abnormal lymphatic tissue development and often present in childhood. LMs involving the thorax can present as various diseases, such as mediastinal masses, interstitial lung disease, plastic bronchitis, recurrent pneumonia, chylothorax, and bronchiectasis. Historically, the term "diffuse pulmonary lymphangiomatosis" was used to diagnose LMs involving the chest. However, with the increasing understanding of lymphatic disorders, this definition has been found to be inaccurate. The classification system of LMs was revised by the International Society for the Study of Vascular Anomalies (ISSVA) in 2014 and 2018. Subsequent studies have further introduced a definition for complex lymphatic abnormalities (CLAs), including generalized lymphatic anomaly (GLA), kaposiform lymphangiomatosis (KLA), central conducting lymphatic anomaly (CCLA), and Gorham–Stout disease (GSD). Distinct types of LMs exhibit differences in clinical features and outcomes. Given the rarity of thoracic LMs, most available data come from case reports and small series.

In this study, we conducted a retrospective analysis of the largest cohort to date, comprising 42 patients with thoracic LMs, summarizing their classification, clinical manifestations, imaging findings, treatment approaches, and prognosis. These findings aim to enhance our understanding of the disease and improve disease management and prognosis.

### Lymphatic anatomy [^113NtvGN]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

Recent development of new lymphatic imaging and intervention techniques, such as intranodal lymphangiogram, dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance lymphangiography and lymphatic embolization, have resulted in the resurgence of interest in the lymphatic anatomy. The lymphatic system is a continuous maze of interlacing vessels and lymph nodes and is extremely complex and variable. This presents a significant challenge for interpretation of imaging and performance of interventions on this system. There is an embryological reason for this complexity and variability; the lymphatic system sprouts off of primordia from several locations in the body, which later fuse together at different stages of development of the embryo. The lymphatic system can be divided in three distinct parts: soft tissue lymphatics, intestinal lymphatics, and liver lymphatics. Liver and intestinal lymphatics generate approximately 80% of the body lymph and are functionally the most important parts of the lymphatic system. However, their normal anatomy and pathological changes are relatively unknown. In this chapter we will explore the anatomy of these three systems relevant to lymphatic imaging and interventions.

### Vascular and lymphatic malformations: perspectives from human and vertebrate studies [^111B9a98]. Circulation Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Vascular malformations, affecting ≈1% to 1.5% of the population, comprise a spectrum of developmental patterning defects of capillaries, arteries, veins, and/or lymphatics. The majority of vascular malformations occur sporadically; however, inherited malformations exist as a part of complex congenital diseases. The malformations, ranging from birthmarks to life-threatening conditions, are present at birth, but may reveal signs and symptoms-including pain, bleeding, disfigurement, and functional defects of vital organs-in infancy, childhood, or adulthood. Vascular malformations often exhibit recurrent patterns at affected sites due to the lack of curative treatments. This review series provides a state-of-the-art assessment of vascular malformation research at basic, clinical, genetic, and translational levels.

### Non-contrast MR lymphography of the lymphatic system of the liver [^114sjeww]. European Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

This review shows the images obtained with non-contrast MR lymphography in different pathologic conditions affecting the liver. Non-contrast MR lymphography is obtained with a free-breathing 3D high spatial resolution fast-recovery fast spin-echo sequence similar to that used for 3D MR cholangiopancreatography. The liver is the largest lymph-producing organ generating approximately half of the body's lymphatic fluid and is the most important part of the lymphatic system from a functional point of view. Therefore, understanding the anatomy, physiology, and physiopathology of the lymphatics of the liver is important. However, its anatomy and pathology are relatively unknown because of the absence of commonly used imaging techniques. We describe the anatomy, the physiology, and the pathophysiology of the lymphatic system of the liver and the possibility of identifying dilated lymphatic vessels in various liver diseases and conditions. Disruption of normal lymphatic structure and function is observed in various disease conditions. Liver lymph flow is directly correlated with portal venous pressure. Therefore, a dilatation of liver lymphatics is observed in portal hypertension as well as in increased pressure in hepatic veins. After liver transplantation, ligation of lymphatic vessels at the hilum reduces chylous ascites and results in lymphatic dilatation which is easily observed. In severe long-standing biliary stenosis, dilated lymphatic vessels are commonly demonstrated with non-contrast MR lymphography. In hepatocellular carcinoma, intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, and some metastases, lymphatic vessels are abundant in the immediate vicinity of the tumour. These various lymphatic abnormalities can be demonstrated with non-contrast MR lymphography. Key Points
- Anatomy and pathology of the lymphatics of the liver are relatively unknown, partly because of lack of current imaging technique.
- Non-contrast MR lymphography is obtained with a free-breathing 3D high spatial resolution fast spin-echo sequence similar to that used for 3D MR cholangiopancreatography.
- Non-contrast MR lymphography may participate to the understanding of several abnormal liver conditions including portal hypertension, biliary diseases, and malignant hepatic tumours.

### Multidisciplinary approach to the management of lymphatic malformations of the head and neck [^11418Gai]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Lymphatic malformations (LMs) occur in 2.8 to 5 per 100,000 live births. Most involve the head and neck and they are equally common in men and women. They are developmental anomalies of unknown cause, although recent evidence suggests that an upregulation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway may be a causal factor leading to the overproduction of abnormal lymph vessels. These vessels are likely dilated lymphatic sacs sequestered from the lymphatic and venous systems. This overproduction results in the accumulation of lymph in dilated cystic spaces, which in turn results in the clinical features of an LM.

### Current and developing lymphatic imaging approaches for elucidation of functional mechanisms and disease progression [^115yYjT1]. Molecular Imaging and Biology (2024). Medium credibility.

Study of the lymphatic system, compared to that of the other body systems, has been historically neglected. While scientists and clinicians have, in recent decades, gained a better appreciation of the functionality of the lymphatics as well as their role in associated diseases (and consequently investigated these topics further in their experimental work), there is still much left to be understood of the lymphatic system. In this review article, we discuss the role lymphatic imaging techniques have played in this recent series of advancements and how new imaging techniques can help bolster this wave of discovery. We specifically highlight the use of lymphatic imaging techniques in understanding the fundamental anatomy and physiology of the lymphatic system; investigating the development of lymphatic vasculature (using techniques such as intravital microscopy); diagnosing, staging, and treating lymphedema and cancer; and its role in other disease states.

### Physiological perspective on therapies of lymphatic vessels [^1126JSWS]. Advances in Wound Care (2018). Low credibility.

Contrasting Lymphatic Functions and Pathologies

The open circulation of the lymphatic system is composed of capillaries, collecting vessels, and functionally distant, lymph node sinuses. The primary role of lymphatic capillaries and collectors is to transport tissue fluid, macromolecules, and immune cells from the interstitium through the lymph nodes and back to the blood circulation. Ontologically, lymphatics are derived from the venular compartment of blood circulation, which is reflected by the shared expression pattern of proteins that are essential for common functions of blood and lymphatic vessels: transport of fluid, the attraction of leukocytes, and assistance in their adhesion and transmigration. At the same time, the physiology and the biological relevance of blood and lymph circulatory systems differ drastically. For example, blood vessels are exposed to possibly the highest concentration of oxygen and nutrients, whereas hypoxic lymphatics are submerged in the effluent of tissue metabolites. Undoubtedly, lymphatics play a minor role in animal survival and even damage to the thoracic duct, the largest of lymphatic vessels, does not pose an imminent life threat. As a result, injured lymphatics are not compelled to patch hemorrhages as vigorously and consistently as blood vessels do, which justifies the absence of thrombocytes, a cellular arm of the blood clotting mechanism, in the lymph. Further, in contrast to blood vessels where control of blood fluidity is recognized as a factor that determines their functionality, we have only scant knowledge about mechanisms employed by the lymphatic endothelium to control lymph hemostasis in normal or pathologic conditions. This example illustrates how incomplete is our understanding of the fundamental biology and, in consequence, pathology of the lymphatic system.

### Primary lymphoedema and lymphatic malformation: are they the two sides of the same coin? [^112g59KB]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives

To clear the confusion regarding the relationship between the 'primary lymphoedema' and (truncular) lymphatic malformation (LM); the latter is one of congenital vascular malformations.

Materials & Methods

A literature review was carried out on the primary lymphoedema either existing as an independent LM lesion or as a component of the Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome.

Results

The review was able to provide a contemporary guide/conclusion on the definition and classification, clinical evaluation and clinical management regarding conservative (physical) therapy, reconstructive surgical therapy and ablative/excisional surgical therapy, for the primary lymphoedema as an LM.

Conclusions

Primary lymphoedema can be considered as 'congenital' since its majority represents a clinical manifestation of the truncular type of LM arising during the later stages of lymphangiogenesis. Such embryological staging information of the LM is critical for proper management of the primary lymphoedema when it exists with other congenital vascular malformations (Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome). 2. Basic non-invasive to minimally invasive tests will provide an adequate diagnosis and lead to the correct multidisciplinary, specifically targeted and sequenced treatment strategy. 3. The mainstay of current management of the primary lymphoedema/truncular LM is complex decongestive therapy; and the reconstructive as well as ablative surgical therapy remain adjunctive therapies at best.

### Lymphatic malformations: genetics, mechanisms and therapeutic strategies [^1117KrZJ]. Circulation Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Lymphatic vessels maintain tissue fluid homeostasis by returning to blood circulation interstitial fluid that has extravasated from the blood capillaries. They provide a trafficking route for cells of the immune system, thus critically contributing to immune surveillance. Developmental or functional defects in the lymphatic vessels, their obstruction or damage, lead to accumulation of fluid in tissues, resulting in lymphedema. Here we discuss developmental lymphatic anomalies called lymphatic malformations and complex lymphatic anomalies that manifest as localized or multifocal lesions of the lymphatic vasculature, respectively. They are rare diseases that are caused mostly by somatic mutations and can present with variable symptoms based upon the size and location of the lesions composed of fluid-filled cisterns or channels. Substantial progress has been made recently in understanding the molecular basis of their pathogenesis through the identification of their genetic causes, combined with the elucidation of the underlying mechanisms in animal disease models and patient-derived lymphatic endothelial cells. Most of the solitary somatic mutations that cause lymphatic malformations and complex lymphatic anomalies occur in genes that encode components of oncogenic growth factor signal transduction pathways. This has led to successful repurposing of some targeted cancer therapeutics to the treatment of lymphatic malformations and complex lymphatic anomalies. Apart from the mutations that act as lymphatic endothelial cell-autonomous drivers of these anomalies, current evidence points to superimposed paracrine mechanisms that critically contribute to disease pathogenesis and thus provide additional targets for therapeutic intervention. Here, we review these advances and discuss new treatment strategies that are based on the recently identified molecular pathways.

### Primary lymphoedema [^111Ucwpb]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2021). High credibility.

Lymphoedema is the swelling of one or several parts of the body owing to lymph accumulation in the extracellular space. It is often chronic, worsens if untreated, predisposes to infections and causes an important reduction in quality of life. Primary lymphoedema (PLE) is thought to result from abnormal development and/or functioning of the lymphatic system, can present in isolation or as part of a syndrome, and can be present at birth or develop later in life. Mutations in numerous genes involved in the initial formation of lymphatic vessels (including valves) as well as in the growth and expansion of the lymphatic system and associated pathways have been identified in syndromic and non-syndromic forms of PLE. Thus, the current hypothesis is that most cases of PLE have a genetic origin, although a causative mutation is identified in only about one-third of affected individuals. Diagnosis relies on clinical presentation, imaging of the structure and functionality of the lymphatics, and in genetic analyses. Management aims at reducing or preventing swelling by compression therapy (with manual drainage, exercise and compressive garments) and, in carefully selected cases, by various surgical techniques. Individuals with PLE often have a reduced quality of life owing to the psychosocial and lifelong management burden associated with their chronic condition. Improved understanding of the underlying genetic origins of PLE will translate into more accurate diagnosis and prognosis and personalized treatment.

### Intestinal lymphatic dysfunction in kidney disease [^115zsELE]. Circulation Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Of note, the local interstitial environment exerts different effects on lymphatic vessels based on the quantity and composition of fluid, cells, and solutes leaked from surrounding blood vessels. Numerous diseases are associated with deranged blood vessel endothelial barrier function, increased permeability, and extravasation into the microenvironment surrounding lymphatic vessels. This is especially common in diseases with an inflammatory component where the capillary leakage of blood-derived fluid, cells, and proteins then becomes a critical driver of lymphatic flow and lymphatic dysfunction. Such extravasation may be especially prominent in kidney diseases accompanied by hypoalbuminemia that lessens intravascular oncotic pressure promoting further transudation. In addition to these general principles of lymphatic vessel structure and function, the lymphatics of the gut have unique properties discussed below.

### Abnormal pulmonary lymphatic flow in patients with lymphatic anomalies and respiratory compromise [^111sUQ7K]. Chest (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Pulmonary involvement in lymphatic anomalies (LA) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance lymphangiography (DCMRL) is capable of imaging the lymphatic system in a variety of pulmonary lymphatic disorders.

Research Question

The objective of this study is to describe the central lymphatic anatomy in patients with LA and pulmonary involvement on DCMRL.

Study Design and Methods

This prospective observational study enrolled 16 patients with LA (mean age, 17 years; range, 6–63 years; ratio of female to male patients, 9:7) with pulmonary involvement. All patients underwent DCMRL. The lymphatic system was assessed for the presence of mediastinal masses, interstitial lung disease, size and tortuosity of the thoracic duct (TD), and presence of abnormal pulmonary lymphatic flow.

Results

T2-weighted imaging showed the following: mediastinal soft tissue masses in 10 patients, diffuse pulmonary interstitial thickening in 13 patients, and bone involvement in 15 patients. DCMRL revealed abnormal pulmonary lymphatic flow in 14 of 16 patients. Abnormal pulmonary lymphatic flow originated from the TD in three of 14 patients, the retroperitoneum in six of 14 patients, and both the TD and retroperitoneum in four of 14 patients. In nine of 16 patients, the TD was dilated and tortuous. In two patients the TD was not identified, and in five patients it was normal.

Interpretation

Abnormal pulmonary lymphatic flow/perfusion from the TD or retroperitoneum into the lung parenchyma occurred in the majority of patients in this study. These findings can explain the interstitial lung disease and chylothorax resulting in deterioration of respiratory function in these patients. Future studies will determine whether mechanical cessation of this abnormal flow can improve pulmonary function and prolong survival in patients with LA.

### Current and developing lymphatic imaging approaches for elucidation of functional mechanisms and disease progression [^111LxMc2]. Molecular Imaging and Biology (2024). Medium credibility.

Despite this great accuracy in detecting true negatives and positives, lymphoscintigraphy does have some drawbacks. First and foremost, lymphoscintigraphy has poor spatial resolution. This may not have a significant impact on its ability to detect the presence of lymphedema, but it does mean that lymphoscintigraphy cannot provide much anatomical information, placing limitations on how much information it can provide clinicians about the specific disease states of individual cases. Lymphoscintigraphy also lacks standardization, particularly regarding quantitative analysis of results. There are no "standardized" sets of drainage times or even acquisition time points by which clinicians can conclusively diagnose lymphedema. Instead, they largely rely on conducting bilateral lymphoscintigraphy, and compare drainage times and patterns between the suspected diseased and healthy limbs. This introduces another variable into the diagnosis process and can open the door to inconsistency in diagnosis from center to center and clinician to clinician. Lastly, although quantitative lymphoscintigraphy does allow for increased sensitivity relative to qualitative methods, lymphoscintigraphy images can still be "normal" for patients in very early stages of the disease process. This means that lymphoscintigraphy may be unable to detect lymphedema early enough, resulting in detection only when more extensive physiological abnormalities such as dermal backflow are manifested more thoroughly.

### Outcome evaluation for the treatment of low flow venous and lymphatic malformations [^116cKUiR]. CVIR Endovascular (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Vascular malformations are complex abnormalities causing significant morbidity and disability. In 1996, the International Society for the Study of Vascular Anomalies (ISSVA) developed a classification system that has been significant in helping to clarify the distinctions between different vascular anomalies, leading to improved patient management (Table 1). The most common vascular malformations are low flow vascular malformations (LFVM) which is the group of patients studied in this paper.

Table 1
ISSVA Classification of vascular anomalies ©2018 International Society for the Study of Vascular Anomalies

LFVMs present with variable symptoms including swelling, pain, functional limitations, tissue ulceration and cosmetic issues. Sclerotherapy is the treatment of choice for most symptomatic low flow venous and lymphatic malformations (VM and LM), usually requiring multiple treatment sessions to achieve a satisfactory response.

Publications have focused on the technical and short-term results of treatment, which have concluded that VMs are difficult to treat and that most patients require multiple therapeutic sessions for clinical effectiveness to be achieved. Moreover, there is little consensus on the objective evaluation of treatment success of low-flow vascular malformations. Few research articles have described the improvement in symptoms and patient satisfaction as the key factor for assessment. However, there remains a need for more objective tools. A review of current literature confirms that there are still no definite criteria to evaluate sclerotherapy success.

The purpose of this study was to describe the outcome evaluation of the treatment of low flow malformations and to describe a standardized method that is both subjective and objective.

### The lymphatic system in the fontan patient-pathophysiology, imaging, and interventions: what the anesthesiologist should know [^113XuipT]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2022). Medium credibility.

The Fontan surgery was developed as a palliative intervention for congenital heart disease (CHD) patients with single-ventricle physiology who are not candidates for a biventricular repair. Improvements in the surgery and medical management of these patients have increased survival, yet this population remains at risk for complications and end-organ dysfunction due to Fontan failure. Lymphatic vessels maintain a fluid balance within the extracellular space, participate in fat reabsorption from the small intestine, and play an important role in the body's immune response. Altered Starling forces at the capillary level, capillary leak, and lymphatic obstruction contribute to lymphatic dysfunction in patients with Fontan physiology. These lymphatic complications include edema, pleural effusions, plastic bronchitis (PB), and protein-losing enteropathy (PLE). Over the past decade, there have been innovations in lymphatic imaging. These new imaging techniques include noncontrast magnetic resonance (MR) lymphangiography, intranodal lymphangiography (IL), dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance lymphangiography (DCMRL), and liver lymphangiography. These imaging techniques help in delineating anatomy and guiding the appropriate therapeutic approach. Lymphatic interventions then may be performed to decompress the lymphatic system or to identify and occlude abnormal lymphatic vessels and drainage pathways. The anesthesiologist should have an understanding of the effects of lymphatic disorders on the Fontan circulation and apply appropriate management techniques for the associated interventions. The Fontan surgery was developed as a palliative intervention for CHD patients with single-ventricle physiology who are not candidates for a biventricular repair. The surgery creates a series systemic and pulmonary circulation with the energy necessary to provide gradient-driven pulmonary blood flow generated by the ventricle. 1 In the past decades, improvements in the surgery and medical management of these patients have increased survival, with 30-year survival rates close to 85%. 2 Despite these improvements, this population remains at risk for complications and end-organ dysfunction due to Fontan failure, which is characterized by elevated systemic venous pressures and low cardiac output. These complications include arrhythmias, cardiac dysfunction, ascites, liver fibrosis/cirrhosis, renal dysfunction, pulmonary failure, and lymphatic complications such as edema, pleural effusions, PB, and PLE. Complications ultimately contribute to increased risk for hospitalization, death, and need for heart transplantation. 3, 4 For this reason, there has been increasing interest in the role of abnormal lymphatic circulation in the genesis of Fontan failure. The authors characterize the lymphatic pathophysiology associated with Fontan physiology and review the imaging and interventional strategies used to treat these patients.

### Current views on diagnostic approach and treatment of lymphedema [^112EEUW6]. The American Journal of Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Lymphedema is a chronic, progressive, and often debilitating condition. Primary lymphedema is a lymphatic malformation developing during the later stage of lymphangiogenesis. Secondary lymphedema is the result of obstruction or disruption of the lymphatic system, which can occur as a consequence of tumors, surgery, trauma, infection, inflammation, and radiation therapy. In this review, we report an update upon the diagnostic approach and the medical and surgical therapy for both primary and secondary lymphedema.

### Physiological perspective on therapies of lymphatic vessels [^114CUYfk]. Advances in Wound Care (2018). Low credibility.

Summary

Contrary to expectations, the current research shows that organizational simplicity and capillary tolerance for functional flows, features inherent to the lymphatic system, do not necessarily translate into straightforward treatment applications. Lack of growth factors that are unique to specific lymphatic compartments increases the risk of not only lymphatic abnormalities but also off-target activation of the blood vasculature. The desired effect on lymphatic function might be more readily achieved with control-released VEGF-C delivery methods. Finally, lymphatics might be targeted to exploit their functional redundancy and nature of volume-sequestering structures and to reshape their biology to gain new functions such as enhanced antigen presentation or increased vascular density.

Take-Home Messages
- The relevance of new lymphatic functions has not been verified in known human pathologies, and the complete etiology of secondary lymphedema is unknown.
- Capillary and collecting lymphatics serve different functions, with no known diseases ascribed to capillary abnormalities.
- Physiological functionality is a unique feature of lymphatic hyperplasia, a persistent outgrowth of lymphatic capillaries.
- The outcome of VEGF-C treatment on lymphatics must be separated from its effect on blood vessels.
- Lymphatic specificity of VEGF-C can be achieved with the delayed or controlled release of VEGF-C.

### Disorders of lymphatic architecture and flow in critical illness [^111xa9My]. Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To provide a narrative review of disordered lymphatic dynamics and its impact on critical care relevant condition management.

Data Sources

Detailed search strategy using PubMed and Ovid Medline for English language articles (2013–2023) describing congenital or acquired lymphatic abnormalities including lymphatic duct absence, injury, leak, or obstruction and their associated clinical conditions that might be managed by a critical care medicine practitioner.

Study Selection

Studies that specifically addressed abnormalities of lymphatic flow and their management were selected. The search strategy time frame was limited to the last 10 years to enhance relevance to current practice.

Data Extraction

Relevant descriptions or studies were reviewed, and abstracted data were parsed into structural or functional etiologies, congenital or acquired conditions, and their management within critical care spaces in an acute care facility.

Data Synthesis

Abnormal lymph flow may be identified stemming from congenital lymphatic anomalies including lymphatic structure absence as well as acquired obstruction or increased flow from clinical entities or acute therapy. Macro- and microsurgical as well as interventional radiological techniques may address excess, inadequate, or obstructed lymph flow. Patients with deranged lymph flow often require critical care, and those who require critical care may concomitantly demonstrate deranged lymph flow that adversely impacts care.

Conclusions

Critical care clinicians ideally demonstrate functional knowledge of conditions that are directly related to, or are accompanied by, deranged lymphatic dynamics to direct timely diagnostic and therapeutic interventions during a patient's ICU care episode.

### Liver lymphatic anatomy and role in systemic lymphatic disease [^113jeewn]. European Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Previously, a few different etiologies of chylothorax and PB have been described and predominately originate from retrograde PLP from the central lymphatics. However, there have been several patients in our study that have PB and/or chylothorax with no significant PLP identified from the thoracic duct, suggesting another possible lymphatic source. With organ-specific intrahepatic lymphangiography, we identified a subset of patients who have abnormal connections from the liver lymphatics with direct connections to the pulmonary lymphatics bypassing the central lymphatic system. Liver lymphatic imaging should likely be performed in all patients with chylothorax and PB when central lymphatic imaging is normal.

One unique group that has not been previously reported was the abnormal connection/flow from the hepatic lymphatics to the mesentery (hepatomesentery). It is unclear how these abnormal connections or reversal of flow develops or how this affects the drainage of intestinal lymphatics. It could result in bowel edema or even potentially ascites with the dilated and congested lymphatics leaking into the peritoneum. However, in our small group of patients with these findings, there was no clear association with any specific type of lymphatic disorder.

Subsets of PLE, particularly patients that have congenital heart disease, are known to have abnormal hepatoduodenal connections that were seen in a small series of patients. In our larger cohort of 47 patients with PLE, hepatoduodenal connections were almost pathognomonic in our study population. This will need further investigation, but it does suggest that abnormal hepatic connections could be much more common in this patient population than previously thought.

In addition to the identification of the four abnormal compartment connections from the liver lymphatics in disease states, we have also determined that the presence of these connections has a clinically significant implication in their disease course. In patients who underwent lymphatic interventions, those with abnormal liver lymphatics required more interventions, had a longer time for symptom resolution, and were more likely to have a failure of treatment with symptoms present 6 months after the intervention. This could be caused by the delayed diagnosis of liver involvement in disease as there were a significant number of patients that had previous lymphatic interventions in this study. In addition, there may be individual differences between each subgroup of abnormal lymphatics and disease presentation that this study was not powered to detect. Even with the early identification and intervention, it is still likely there are differences between this etiology of these diseased vessels, such as the number/density/location of the abnormal lymph vessels as well as their response post-treatment that are unknown.

Vascular malformations are developmental disorders involving the blood and lymphatic vasculature. The study of vascular malformations is a complex and rapidly evolving field with new understanding and insights into the clinical, histopathology, and molecular basis of these lesions. Diagnostic classification of vascular malformations is based on their unique clinical, radiologic imaging, histologic, and molecular characteristics. This article follows the published classification of the International Society for the Study of Vascular Anomalies. It describes characteristic histopathologic findings in tissues of vascular malformations and information on known genetic causes.

### The 2023 Society for Vascular Surgery, American Venous Forum, and American Vein and Lymphatic Society clinical practice guidelines for the management of varicose veins of the lower extremities. part II: endorsed by the Society of Interventional Radiology and the Society for Vascular Medicine [^112qrBbN]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). High credibility.

Evaluation of patients with varicose veins — classification and grading: We recommend the use of the 2020 updated CEAP classification system for chronic venous disorders. The clinical or basic CEAP classification can be used for clinical practice, and the full CEAP classification system should be used for clinical research. Rationale notes the CEAP system was designed in 1994, updated in 2004, and most recently in 2020, and is based on clinical signs, etiology, anatomy and pathology (reflux and obstruction) of chronic venous disorders. The basic or clinical CEAP classification reports the single highest C class, and the advanced CEAP reports all C classes present in the limb. Patients with reticular veins (subdermal veins between 1 and < 3 mm in diameter) and telangiectasias (subdermal spider veins, < 1 mm in size) belong to Class C1, and varicose veins are dilated subcutaneous tributaries ≥ 3 mm in diameter with patients belonging to CEAP Class C2. The term CVI is reserved for advanced CVD with functional abnormalities of the venous system producing edema, skin changes, or venous leg ulcers. Each clinical class has a subscript indicating the presence or absence of symptoms (s or a), and symptoms of varicose veins may include the HASTI set: heaviness in the legs, achiness, swelling, throbbing, and itching.

### Physiological perspective on therapies of lymphatic vessels [^113C3iJn]. Advances in Wound Care (2018). Low credibility.

Scope and Significance

Rthe physiological functions of lymphatic vessels and the identification of markers and growth factors associated with lymphatics have changed the perception of this auxiliary circulation. However, multiple knowledge gaps persist, which undermine the informed design of treatments, even for disorders such as lymphedema, which arises from impaired lymphatic drainage. In this review, I focus on the role of the endothelium in capillary and collecting lymphatic vessels, two structurally and functionally distinct compartments of the lymphatic system. From this perspective, I summarize the preclinical results from vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-C pro-lymphangiogenic therapies, with an emphasis on prospective therapeutic concepts.

### Lymphatic drainage of thoracic and extrathoracic malignancies [^115dYFkD]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

This review article details the lymphatic drainage pathways for both thoracic and extrathoracic cancers within the chest. The major lymphatic pathways into and through the thorax are reviewed, along with their impact on the spread of cancers. Defects or damage to lymphatic channels and variant anatomy may alter how cancer cells spread through the lymphatic system. Monitoring specific lymph node stations can help in the early detection of lymph node metastases. When an abnormal lymph node is detected without a known primary malignancy, understanding lymphatic drainage pathways can help target the search for the most likely origin of the abnormality.

### Lymphatic dysregulation in patients with Heart Failure: JACC review topic of the week [^111vwKMv]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

The lymphatic system is an integral part of the circulatory system and plays an important role in the volume homeostasis of the human body. The complex anatomy and physiology paired with a lack of simple diagnostic tools to study the lymphatic system have led to an underappreciation of the contribution of the lymphatic system to acute and chronic heart failure (HF). Herein, we discuss the physiological role of the lymphatic system in volume management and the evidence demonstrating the dysregulation of the lymphatic system in HF. Further, we discuss the opportunity to target the lymphatic system in the management of HF and different potential approaches to accessing the lymphatic system.

### Liver lymphatic anatomy and role in systemic lymphatic disease [^113vg2gK]. European Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The main function of the lymphatic system is to remove proteins and fluid from the interstitial space and deliver them back to the venous circulation. The liver is one of the largest contributors of lymphatic fluid, comprising up to 50% of thoracic duct flow and in diseases causing liver congestion, such as heart failure, liver lymphatic flow increases exponentially. There are three categories of liver lymphatic vessels characterized by location: capsular, sublobular, and portal. Liver lymph is generated from hepatic sinusoids in the space of Disse and is connected with the peri-portal space of Mall where the lymphatic capillary vessels begin. The deep portal lymphatics converge at the liver hilum and drain into a complex network of peripancreatic and paraaortic lymph nodes that ultimately connect with the cisterna chyli and thoracic duct. The sublobular lymphatics travel along the hepatic veins toward the wall of the inferior vena cava and the capsular lymphatics drain into the mediastinum (convex surface) or toward the liver hilum (concave surface). All of these networks are essential for efficient lymphatic drainage but can become deranged in various pathological conditions.

Patients with congenital heart disease (CHD) or primary lymphatic disorders can develop lymphatic complications, such as protein losing enteropathy (PLE), chylothorax, chylous ascites, and plastic bronchitis (PB), which can lead to significant morbidity and mortality. Recent advancements in lymphatic imaging using dynamic MRI have greatly advanced our understanding of the abnormalities present in these patient populations. However, there remains a paucity of literature reports describing the liver lymphatic circulation in humans. Conventional liver lymphangiography has demonstrated abnormalities in patients with liver cirrhosis and chylous ascites as well as PLE and hepatic lymphorrhea and the original liver lymphatic descriptions relied on standard lymphangiography as well as post-mortem analysis. More recently, non-contrast MR liver lymphography has been described as a new technique to noninvasively visualize similar components of the liver lymphatics and changes that occur in portal hypertension. However, this technique only provides a static visualization and does not provide dynamic information that is crucial for possible interventions in systemic lymphatic diseases. Recently, Biko et al. have described the development of intrahepatic dynamic contrast MR lymphangiography (IH-DCMRL). This technique has several important advantages over conventional liver imaging in that it is 3-dimensional, has good tissue contrast, provides perfusion information, and can visualize well the distal perfused structures.

The purpose of this article is to investigate the anatomy and flow of the efferent liver lymphatic circulation in patients with systemic lymphatic disease.

### Components of the lymphatic system… [^113oyEmZ]. training.seer.cancer.gov (2025). Medium credibility.

Components of the Lymphatic System The lymphatic system consists of a fluid, vessels that transport the lymph, and organs that contain lymphoid tissue. Lymph. Lymphatic Vessels Lymphatic vessels, unlike blood vessels, only carry fluid away from the tissues. The smallest lymphatic vessels are the lymph capillaries, which begin in the tissue spaces as blind-ended sacs. Lymph capillaries are found in all regions of the body except the bone marrow, central nervous system, and tissues, such as the epidermis, that lack blood vessels. The wall of the lymph capillary is composed of endothelium in which the simple squamous cells overlap to form a simple one-way valve. This arrangement permits fluid to enter the capillary but prevents lymph from leaving the vessel. The microscopic lymph capillaries merge to form lymphatic vessels. Small lymphatic vessels join to form larger tributaries, called lymphatic trunks, which drain large regions.

Lymphatic trunks merge until the lymph enters the two lymphatic ducts. The right lymphatic duct drains lymph from the upper right quadrant of the body. The thoracic duct drains all the rest. Like veins, the lymphatic tributaries have thin walls and have valves to prevent backflow of blood. There is no pump in the lymphatic system like the heart in the cardiovascular system. The pressure gradients to move lymph through the vessels come from the skeletal muscle action, respiratory movement, and contraction of smooth muscle in vessel walls. Lymphatic Organs Lymphatic organs are characterized by clusters of lymphocytes and other cells, such as macrophages, enmeshed in a framework of short, branching connective tissue fibers. The lymphocytes originate in the red bone marrow with other types of blood cells and are carried in the blood from the bone marrow to the lymphatic organs.

When the body is exposed to microorganisms and other foreign substances, the lymphocytes proliferate within the lymphatic organs and are sent in the blood to the site of the invasion. This is part of the immune response that attempts to destroy the invading agent. The lymphatic organs include:

### Update and audit of the ST george's classification algorithm of primary lymphatic anomalies: a clinical and molecular approach to diagnosis [^112qfnTC]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The lymphatic system is a network of vessels important for whole body fluid homeostasis, lipid absorption and immune cell trafficking. Lymphoedema is caused by lymphatic dysfunction, which leads to a build-up of interstitial fluid within the tissues. This manifests with swelling of the extremities, usually of the legs but may involve other regions or segments of the body such as the upper limbs, face, trunk or genital area. There is an increased risk of infection due to disturbances in immune cell trafficking within the segment of compromised lymph drainage. Lymphatic dysfunction within the thorax and abdomen, here referred to as systemic/internal involvement (but can be referred to as visceral or central involvement), may present with pleural or pericardial effusions or ascites, any of which may be chylous, as well as intestinal or pulmonary lymphangiectasia, protein losing enteropathy or chylous reflux.

The International Society for the Study of Vascular Anomalies (ISSVA) updated their classification for vascular anomalies in 2018. The vascular malformations are subgrouped into 'combined', which include more than one type of vessel, 'simple' (only involving one vessel type), and those 'associated with other anomalies'.

Lymphoedema due to a presumed genetic developmental fault in the structure or function of lymph conducting pathways is called primary lymphoedema. Some developmental faults can lead to overt structural defects of the lymph conducting pathways and are called lymphatic malformations. Such malformations if interfering with lymph drainage cause lymphoedema (truncal malformations) but some lymphatic malformations remain as isolated anomalies with no connection to main lymph drainage pathways and do not cause lymphoedema (non-truncal malformations). A primary lymphatic anomaly is an umbrella term referring to all lymphatic abnormalities arising from a developmental fault.

### Multidisciplinary guidelines for initial evaluation of complicated lymphatic anomalies-expert opinion consensus [^1172EYtW]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

Complicated lymphatic anomalies (CLAs) are chronic, progressive, and debilitating conditions that share clinical features, yet key elements for optimal evaluation and management have not been established. We aimed to formulate expert opinion consensus-based guidelines for comprehensive evaluation of CLAs.

Study Design

Patient support groups dedicated to CLAs organized an international conference for vascular anomaly experts from 16 specialties to address the objective. Participants received a set of questions before the meeting and reviewed the literature. Data extracted from international lymphatic anomaly registries were presented and the group separated for panel discussions during the conference. The recommendations achieving consensus within the panel were presented to the entire audience. Open debate occurred until majority approval was achieved.

Results

The expert group was composed of 52 physicians who defined the clinical elements required to evaluate and diagnose a CLA. The radiology panel established the preferred anatomical and functional imaging methods for diagnosis and the elements required to be described during interpretation. Two medical panels compiled the metabolic and hematologic tests at diagnosis and also recommended functional studies. The surgical group recommended precautions for biopsy and the pathology panel provided biopsy specimen processing guidelines.

Conclusions

Patients with CLAs require a comprehensive and targeted diagnostic plan for appropriate management, prevention of complications, and conservation of resources. As this population is managed by diverse medical and surgical specialties, we offer an expert multidisciplinary consensus-based opinion on the current literature and on data extracted from international lymphatic anomaly registries.

Conclusions

Lymphatic abnormalities in the neck and thorax can be seen on T2‐weighted MRI in children with single‐ventricle physiology before their Glenn operation. In individuals with a high lymphatic grading, mortality and chylothorax are more prevalent. Further studies are needed to identify those who are prone to lymphatic abnormalities in CHD as well as how early, perhaps even prenatally, these abnormalities occur.

### Lymphatic system of the head and neck [^112JmWQG]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

An intimate knowledge of the lymphatic drainage of the head and neck is needed by the clinician examining and diagnosing patients with lesion of this region. It is considered that approximately 150 to 300 lymph nodes are located in the neck region. The classification of cervical lymph nodes by Rouvière has long been most widely referenced in textbooks and articles because it covers most of the lymph nodes of the head and neck region. Anatomical review of the lymphatic system of the head and neck helps surgeons understand and treat the patients who have any cancers and cancer metastasis in and around the head and neck regions. Regardless, comprehensive review of the lymphatic system of the head and neck has been rarely discussed. This paper details the anatomy of the lymphatics of these regions by reviewing related publications, books, official reports from the academic society and also describes the clinical manifestations and levels used in staging of the various lymph nodes with illustrations and computed tomographic images.

### Sodium, interstitium, lymphatics and hypertension – A tale of hydraulics [^114cV1TA]. Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Blood pressure is regulated by vascular resistance and intravascular volume. However, exchanges of electrolytes and water between intra and extracellular spaces and filtration of fluid and solutes in the capillary beds blur the separation between intravascular, interstitial and intracellular compartments. Contemporary paradigms of microvascular exchange posit filtration of fluids and solutes along the whole capillary bed and a prominent role of lymphatic vessels, rather than its venous end, for their reabsorption. In the last decade, these concepts have stimulated greater interest in and better understanding of the lymphatic system as one of the master regulators of interstitial volume homeostasis. Here, we describe the anatomy and function of the lymphatic system and focus on its plasticity in relation to the accumulation of interstitial sodium in hypertension. The pathophysiological relevance of the lymphatic system is exemplified in the kidneys, which are crucially involved in the control of blood pressure, but also hypertension-mediated cardiac damage. Preclinical modulation of the lymphatic reserve for tissue drainage has demonstrated promise, but has also generated conflicting results. A better understanding of the hydraulic element of hypertension and the role of lymphatics in maintaining fluid balance can open new approaches to prevent and treat hypertension and its consequences, such as heart failure.

### Pulmonary manifestations of congenital heart disease in children [^112zTEBz]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

This review addresses how anomalous cardiovascular anatomy imparts consequences to the airway, respiratory system mechanics, pulmonary vascular system, and lymphatic system. Abnormal formation or enlargement of great vessels can compress airways and cause large and small airway obstructions. Alterations in pulmonary blood flow associated with congenital heart disease (CHD) can cause abnormalities in pulmonary mechanics and limitation of exercise. CHD can lead to pulmonary arterial hypertension. Lymphatic abnormalities associated with CHD can cause pulmonary edema, chylothorax, or plastic bronchitis. Understanding how the cardiovascular system has an impact on pulmonary growth and function can help determine options and timing of intervention.

### Historical overview of lymphangiogenesis [^114ghCvZ]. Current Opinion in Immunology (2018). Low credibility.

The investigation of the lymphatic system has a very long and intriguing history, with several medical figures which brought important contributions. Work on the lymphatic system began in the 17th century, and by the beginning of the 19th century the anatomy of most of the lymphatic system had been described. This system is an essential component of the immune system, as well as vital to the maintenance of fluid homeostasis within the body. In this review article, I summarize the most important contributions to this field, until to the discovery of a specific lymphangiogenic factor, namely vascular endothelial growth factor-c (VEGF-C) (summarizing figure).

### Physiological perspective on therapies of lymphatic vessels [^111gTJeg]. Advances in Wound Care (2018). Low credibility.

The disease remains a mystery because of an incomplete understanding of the biology and pathophysiology of lymphatics. Paradoxically however, because of a relative functional resistance to injuries or morphological abnormalities, the lymphatic system is less of a risky target for lymphatic-specific manipulation (discussed in the Contrasting Lymphatic Functions and Pathologies section).

### Physiological perspective on therapies of lymphatic vessels [^115ALLdf]. Advances in Wound Care (2018). Low credibility.

It should be noted that the concept of transient occlusion of lymphatics as a physiological response to infection was proposed by Menkin almost a century ago. The author suggested that lymphatic occlusion could be a part of a defense mechanism intended to inhibit the systemic spread of the infection. Practically, ligation of lymphatic collectors in rabbit hindlimb stopped not only the systemic spread of bacteria but also protein toxins of snake venom, preventing death of experimental rabbits. Along these lines, lymphatic-specific PDT could be used to target localized threats, for example, to prevent infective larvae from reaching their final habitat during the early phase of asymptomatic filaria infection or as a means of blocking the systemic dissipation of microfilariafrom lymphatic-dwelling adult worms.

Fluid transport

Lymph nodes concentrate circulating lymph by extracting water through high endothelial venules. In the process, they integrate two key functions of the lymphatic system: immunity and fluid transport. In steady state, peripheral lymphatics drain the entire amount of fluid filtered by blood vessels. Chronic abnormalities in this fluid transport lead to the most well-recognized diseases of lymphatic circulation. In congenital and secondary lymphedema, the developmental abnormalities or injury to the collecting lymphatics lead to the accumulation of fluid and swelling of the limb, followed by irreversible fibrosis. Ocular hypertension in chronic (open-angle) glaucoma is caused primarily by occlusion of the trabecular meshwork, as well as by Schlemm's canal, which are specialized vessels of the eye drainage system that have recently been classified as lymphatics. As much as trabecular channels can be considered capillaries, ocular hypertension is the only disease in which the initial compartment of lymphatics plays a significant role. This circumstance highlights the peculiarity of the lymphatic system, the diseases of which are almost entirely associated with collecting vessels. For example, the obstruction of drainage in lymphedema distichiasis is caused by valve abnormalities, with no role ascribed to lymphatic capillaries, whereas surgical excision of collecting lymphatics is a key but insufficient factor causing secondary lymphedema. The fault tolerance of lymphatic capillaries might be explained by their considerable plasticity and their ability to compensate for an increased fluid load, with a lymph flow rate that can be increased of an order of magnitude during inflammation.

### Lymphatic abnormalities on magnetic resonance imaging in single-ventricle congenital heart defects before glenn operation [^115ik8v4]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

The cause of these lymphatic abnormalities in single‐ventricle patients is still unknown, and it is unknown why only some patients develop lymphatic complications (ie, chylous effusions, plastic bronchitis, protein‐losing enteropathy) and negative overall outcomes (heart transplant, death, etc.). The main causes discussed are those of impairment of lymphatic drainage due to increased CVP, as we discuss later, and perhaps an underlying lymphatic system susceptible to insufficiency. Care should be taken hypothesizing the cause of these lymphatic complications in CHD as the cardiac and lymphatic vascular systems are inevitably intertwined in development, function, and morphology.

The lymphatic changes and abnormalities seen in single‐ventricle CHD are believed to be caused in part by an increased CVP due to the hemodynamic changes arising from the CHD itself or the palliative surgeries. The CVP and the lymphatic production are increased following the Fontan operation, and the innominate vein pressure is increased following Glenn operation/superior cavopulmonary connection. This is believed to lead to a challenged lymphatic drainage, resulting in backward lymphatic congestion and the congested lymphatic networks visible on T2‐MRI. Results from MR lymphangiography have shown that the abnormal network of lymphatic vessels in the neck and thorax correlates with abnormal lymphatic function. Underlying cardiac defect and ventricular function do not seem to dictate the presence of lymphatic abnormalities in our data set. With similar cardiac function in the various groups of lymphatic abnormality, an inherent vascular problem seems to be mandatory although combinations of lymphatic and cardiovascular stress most likely explain the variable outcome.

### Lymph node imaging in patients with primary breast cancer: concurrent diagnostic tools [^115g7okf]. The Oncologist (2020). Medium credibility.

Basic Anatomy of the Axilla

A basic knowledge of the anatomy of the axilla is important to accurately identify the location of abnormal lymph nodes using any cross‐sectional imaging techniques. As early as 1994, Giuliano et al. demonstrated that the status of the sentinel lymph node accurately reflects the status of the entire axillary basin draining a primary breast tumor 9. In fact, malignant cells first enter the nodes (regional spread) through an afferent lymphatic deposit in the subcapsular sinus, growing at this location and eventually replacing the local normal nodal architecture before spreading to a distant body region 10.

The axilla is a pyramidal space situated between the upper aspect of the thoracic wall and the medial aspect of the arm. The axilla is divided into three regions or levels by the pectoralis minor muscle (supplemental online Fig. A) 11:
Level I: Lymph nodes infero‐lateral to the pectoralis minor (Berg's level 1);
Level II: Lymph nodes behind the pectoralis minor (Berg's level 2);
Level III: Lymph nodes supero‐medial to the pectoralis minor (Berg's level 3).

The breast lymphatics are separate from those of the underlying torso, with a subareolar plexus of lymphatics and a small number of large lymphatic vessels draining into axillary lymph nodes. Breast lymphatic drainage comprises superficial, deep, and perforating systems. The superficial system drains to the axilla, usually to level II. The deep system drains to the axilla and also anastomoses with the perforating system that drains to the internal mammary nodes. The perforating system does not connect with the superficial system. From a practical standpoint, drainage generally proceeds in order from level I to level II, to level III, and finally into the thorax 10.

An alternate to the axilla is the drainage to the internal mammary lymph node (IMN) chain. This runs from the anterior phrenic nodes at the diaphragm to its termination in the thoracic venous system on the right and the thoracic duct on the left, and it follows the course of the internal mammary artery and vein between the pleura/endothoracic fascia and the chest wall near the sternal margin. The IMNs are located in the first through sixth intercostal spaces, and they are largest in the first three spaces. Usually, normal internal mammary lymph nodes measure less than 6 mm (supplemental online Fig. A).

### Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance lymphangiography: a simple algorithm for image interpretation [^112ENnN2]. Pediatric Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance lymphangiography is a high-resolution imaging technique that has emerged as the preferred method for evaluating lymphatic anatomy and flow dynamics due to its precise anatomical detail. The lymphatic system has a complex anatomical distribution, and variability is common among individuals with cardiac abnormalities, particularly congenital heart disease. Lymphatic imaging has recently been revolutionized by the introduction of MR lymphangiography. However, challenges in interpreting these images persist due to limited availability of this modality, and the expertise required for its performance and interpretation, especially in pediatric patients. We aim to outline a simple algorithm employed in our practice for interpreting MR lymphangiography images for pediatric radiologists.

Many patients are born with lymphatic abnormalities or are susceptible to pathology following cardiac surgery. It therefore becomes important to evaluate and treat lymphatic disorders in centers performing congenital heart surgery. Programs can make strides towards starting a lymphatic branch if appropriately equipped with proper staff, tools, and other capabilities to perform lymphatic system access, imaging, and intervention. In reality, many of these components already exist in most centers, and a successful and comprehensive program can be established by enlisting these already established services.

### Biologic and clinical significance of lymphadenectomy [^1115yufa]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2000). Low credibility.

Interest in the lymphatic system and its relationship to metastases has developed owing to renewed interest in sentinel node biopsy. This article summarizes the anatomy, physiology, and biology of the lymphatic system and lymph node metastases, and reviews studies of lymph node metastases and surgical resection of cancers in different anatomic sites. On the basis of these studies, the authors conclude that lymph node metastasis functions as an indicator of prognosis, not the controlling or determining factor of prognosis. Thus, varying degrees of treatment of regional lymph nodes and metastases do not seem to be controlling factors in the outcome of cancer.

### Current and developing lymphatic imaging approaches for elucidation of functional mechanisms and disease progression [^1179N62Y]. Molecular Imaging and Biology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The lymphatic system plays several varied, important roles in the function of the human body. On a daily basis, it takes up several liters of fluid that extravasates from the capillaries into the interstitial space and returns it to the circulation. Lymphatic vasculature plays a key role in the immune system, transporting antigens and antigen-presenting cells to lymph nodes, resulting in detection and response to threats. Lacteals, a set of lymphatic vessels in the microvilli of the intestine, take up ingested lipids that cannot enter the bloodstream directly, providing a path for them to ultimately enter circulation. Due to their vital role as a trafficking system, the lymphatics can cause or exacerbate several debilitating diseases when a physiological irregularity arises in the body. For instance, lymphedema, a painful condition resulting in swelling of the arms and legs, is directly caused by an inability of the lymphatic vasculature to adequately drain interstitial fluid. Lymphatic vasculature, in addition to the cardiovascular system, also provides routes for cancer to metastasize, a critical event resulting in much higher mortality rates for patients.

Despite the significance of the lymphatic system in both day-to-day function and disease progression, knowledge regarding its inner workings has historically lagged behind that of its sanguine counterpart. This disconnect is perhaps most striking when considering soon-to-be clinicians' level of exposure to the topic during their training; a 2004 article by Rockson et al. reported that the average US medical student received less than 30 min of instruction regarding the lymphatic system during the course of their studies. In recent decades, a surge of academic interest in the lymphatics has helped fill this knowledge gap. Interest in lymphatic imaging has helped lead the way, with over 27,000 new entries into the PubMed database since the turn of the millennium (Fig. 1). Despite this recent interest, lymphatic imaging remains as a relatively small proportion of all conducted lymphatic research. Additional work on the imaging front needs to be done to better understand the lymphatic system and its role in various disease states. In this review, we discuss several current and developing lymphatic imaging approaches for assessment of lymphatic function and development, as well as imaging methods used for diagnosing, staging, and planning the treatment of associated diseases like cancer and lymphedema. We also discuss the current limitations of some of these approaches and areas of improvement for future techniques to ultimately improve patient outcomes.

Current Diagnostic and Treatment Recommendations for Lymphatic Disorders

Current diagnostic and treatment recommendations for lymphatic disorders were initially outlined by Dori et al 41 from Children's Hospital of Philadelphia in 2022 with the latest updated recommendations published in a recent review article by Bauer et al in 2023. Noncontrast MRL, using heavily weighted T2 sequences to image slow‐moving nonbloody fluids such as lymphatic fluid, has demonstrated a strong correlation between high‐grade thoracic lymphatic abnormalities and poor Fontan outcomes (Figure 5). It is a fast and noninvasive diagnostic tool suitable for inclusion during routine cardiac MRI and has previously been suggested as a screening tool for all thoracic lymphatic abnormalities in patients with single‐ventricle involvement before Fontan completion. Currently, our study shows that only 4 of the 31 included centers perform MRL screening in all patients before the Fontan procedure. Additionally, it is recommended that all patients with suspected lymphatic abnormalities undergo cardiac catheterization to exclude systemic obstruction and assess hemodynamics. If symptoms persist despite optimized medical treatment and percutaneous procedures addressing potential obstructions, DCMRL is recommended as the gold standard method to evaluate the lymphatic system and its flow characteristics (Figure 6). This minimally invasive testing technique involves dynamic and static contrast‐enhanced MRI following ultrasound‐guided and radiographically guided contrast injections at different access points: intranodal DCMRL for central lymphatics, intrahepatic DCMRL for hepatosystemic lymphatics, and intramesenteric DCMRL for peritoneal/mesenteric lymphatics. Since contrast is visible only in parts of the lymphatic system within the contrast pathway, different access points are used depending on the clinical presentation. This diagnostic examination can be followed by appropriate lymphatic intervention while the patient is still under general anesthesia. Lymphatic intervention can be categorized into those aimed at occluding abnormal lymphatic ducts (using glue, coils, or a combination) and those intended to decompress the entire lymphatic system (surgical or catheter‐based Hraska interventions). Based on case series and case report studies, algorithms have been proposed for the diagnostic evaluation and treatment of patients with chylothorax, PLE, PB, and multicompartment disorders, defined as lymphatic perfusion abnormalities involving at least 2 compartments, including the thorax, abdomen, and soft tissue. A more detailed description and flowcharts can be found elsewhere.

### Lymphatics in the liver [^1175BXwd]. Current Opinion in Immunology (2018). Low credibility.

The liver is the largest lymph producing organ. A significant increase in the number of hepatic lymphatic vessels, or lymphangiogenesis, has been reported in various liver diseases, including, but not limited to, cirrhosis, viral hepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Despite its apparent relevance in healthy and diseased livers as these and other observations indicate, the hepatic lymphatic system has been poorly studied. With knowledge of the lymphatic system in other organs and tissues incorporated, this review article addresses the current knowledge of the hepatic lymphatic system and the potential role of lymphatic endothelial cells in the health and the disease of the liver and concludes with a brief description on future directions of the study of the hepatic lymphatic system.

### Liver lymphatic anatomy and role in systemic lymphatic disease [^1134jVTV]. European Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Using novel lymphatic imaging techniques, this study has identified an under-appreciated role of liver lymphatics in systemic lymphatic diseases. Five different imaging categories (normal, hepatoperitoneal, hepatopulmonary, hepatomesenteric, and hepatoduodenal) were identified and further observed that they were substantially correlated with disease presentation (normal – chylothorax/PB, hepatoperitoneal – ascites/chylothorax, hepatopulmonary – chylothorax/PB, hepatoduodenal – PLE). In addition, the presence of abnormal patterns correlated with increased morbidity of their disease.

Liver lymphatics are a major contributor to central lymphatic flow and while their role in systemic diseases such as liver cirrhosis and heart failure have been studied previously, there is little information about the involvement in systemic lymphatic disorders. This has in part been limited by the inability to clinically visualize the liver lymphatics. However, with recent advancements in imaging modalities and techniques, we can now visualize organ-specific lymphatic connections such as those from the liver. We have used these new modalities and now report on the role of the liver lymphatics in chylothorax, ascites, PB, and PLE.

The identification of normal hepatic lymphatic connections has been predominately studied from traditional lymphangiography and anatomic studies and have been limited in their ability to describe a 3D relationship and distal connections with the central lymphatic system. In our cohort, we had a significant number of patients with anatomically normal connections via perihepatic/peripancreatic/paraaortic lymphatic vessels and lymph nodes that drain into the central thoracic duct. This is the largest known cohort to show the detail of these connections. Furthermore, using the normal anatomy as a baseline we identified four types of abnormal connections.

We identified that abnormal hepatoperitoneal connections were most commonly observed in patients with underlying ascites consistent with previously reported case studies. In this group, standard intranodal lymphangiography did not elucidate the mechanism and was only visualized with hepatic lymphatic imaging. While there have been previous reports of abnormal hepatic lymphatic drainage in ascites, our results indicate this could be a much more common mechanism than previously thought and would suggest considering an evaluation of liver lymphatics in all patients with ascites.

### MR lymphangiography in lymphatic disorders: clinical applications, institutional experience, and practice development [^115mDDvQ]. Radiographics (2024). Medium credibility.

Lymphatic flow and anatomy can be challenging to study, owing to variable lymphatic anatomy in patients with diverse primary or secondary lymphatic pathologic conditions and the fact that lymphatic imaging is rarely performed in healthy individuals. The primary components of the lymphatic system outside the head and neck are the peripheral, retroperitoneal, mesenteric, hepatic, and pulmonary lymphatic systems and the thoracic duct. Multiple techniques have been developed for imaging components of the lymphatic system over the past century, with trade-offs in spatial, temporal, and contrast resolution; invasiveness; exposure to ionizing radiation; and the ability to obtain information on dynamic lymphatic flow. More recently, dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MR lymphangiography (MRL) has emerged as a valuable tool for imaging both lymphatic flow and anatomy in a variety of congenital and acquired primary or secondary lymphatic disorders. The authors provide a brief overview of lymphatic physiology, anatomy, and imaging techniques. Next, an overview of DCE MRL and the development of an MRL practice and workflow in a hybrid interventional MRI suite incorporating cart-based in-room US is provided, with an emphasis on multidisciplinary collaboration. The spectrum of congenital and acquired lymphatic disorders encountered early in an MRL practice is provided, with emphasis on the diversity of imaging findings and how DCE MRL can aid in diagnosis and treatment of these patients. Methods such as DCE MRL for assessing the hepatic and mesenteric lymphatic systems and emerging technologies that may further expand DCE MRL use such as three-dimensional printing are introduced. © RSNA, 2024 Test Your Knowledge questions for this article are available in the supplemental material.
