DIC work up adn treatment

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a step-by-step workflow for the diagnostic workup and treatment of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about when to suspect DIC in context and which underlying conditions trigger it. Then, I should verify the initial laboratory panel and how scoring systems are applied. Next, I will review how to exclude mimics and detect early or non-overt DIC. After that, I need to confirm therapeutic priorities: treat the cause, provide supportive hemostasis, and decide when to anticoagulate. Finally, I will consider special populations, monitoring cadence, and updates to definitions and scoring systems, making sure to question assumptions and double-check thresholds as I go along [^114hjtJr] [^116EPivo] [^114NFaAf] [^112s7rgs].

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame: DIC is a secondary syndrome, not a primary disease, so I need to anchor suspicion in high-risk contexts such as sepsis or septic shock, major trauma, malignancy including acute promyelocytic leukemia, obstetric calamities like placental abruption or amniotic fluid embolism, and certain catastrophic inflammatory states including heat stroke or massive pulmonary embolism; on exam I should look for simultaneous bleeding and thrombotic manifestations and signs of organ dysfunction from microvascular thrombosis, but hold on, I should verify that diagnosis must always integrate clinical context rather than rely on a stand-alone lab test [^11148vf8] [^115G8nHt] [^112CJSTX] [^113xgwsE].

> Next, I should review the initial laboratory workup with caution because no single assay diagnoses DIC; global coagulation tests including platelet count, PT/INR, fibrinogen, and a fibrin-related marker such as D-dimer comprise the core panel recommended by ISTH scoring, while aPTT and a peripheral smear for schistocytes can add supportive information; wait, let me verify the role of viscoelastic testing because although TEG/ROTEM can provide rapid insights, they are not yet validated as diagnostic criteria for DIC and should not replace standard testing in sepsis or trauma settings [^114hjtJr] [^116EPivo] [^11148vf8] [^1177rNxL].

> I will now examine how to handle fibrinogen measurement pragmatically, and here I need to self-correct: at first glance I wrote "fibrinogen level (quantitative): more precise than the Clauss assay", but wait, that reverses the usual standard because the Clauss method is itself the standard functional quantitative fibrinogen assay, while immunologic assays measure antigen and can diverge in inflammatory states; let me correct that and ensure I interpret fibrinogen as an acute phase reactant that may remain normal early in DIC despite consumption, so serial trends matter for decision-making and for thresholds relevant to replacement therapy [^114hjtJr] [^111Q1fAh].

> Hold on, I should verify how to calculate and interpret the ISTH overt DIC score: I sum points for platelet count, PT prolongation, fibrinogen, and fibrin-related markers to reach a total where a score of 5 or more supports overt DIC and correlates with outcomes; wait a minute, I initially considered using fixed μg/mL D-dimer cutoffs with four tiers, but that is not the original ISTH scheme, which uses categorical assessment of fibrin-related markers as no, moderate, or strong increase with corresponding points and must be interpreted against local assay characteristics and reference ranges, so I will stick to the validated scoring approach and repeat testing if the score is below 5 but clinical suspicion persists [^117AYd2c] [^116EPivo] [^114NFaAf].

> I need to ensure I am not missing mimics or coexisting entities: primary hyperfibrinolysis can masquerade as DIC but often has a normal platelet count with an abnormal euglobulin clot lysis test and a negative protamine paracoagulation test, whereas in DIC platelets typically fall and the protamine paracoagulation test can be positive; I should also double-check for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia using a clinical score like the 4Ts and appropriate immuno-functional assays, and consider thrombotic microangiopathies when hemolysis, severe thrombocytopenia, and organ injury suggest ADAMTS13 deficiency or complement dysregulation [^117XB1ir] [^116Bf9dj] [^114WNZwX].

> Let me think about early-phase recognition because waiting for overt DIC can miss a therapeutic window: markers of thrombin generation and endogenous anticoagulant depletion such as antithrombin and protein C may flag pre-DIC, and in sepsis the SIC score can identify non-overt coagulopathy before full decompensation; I should confirm that combining serial global tests with molecular markers or using modified non-overt criteria can improve early detection, acknowledging variable availability and validation across centers [^116o6UxA] [^117Gqdiq] [^117S1D8M] [^115AJiNc].

> Before moving to blood products, I should emphasize the cornerstone: treat the underlying cause promptly because source control and disease-directed therapy drive reversal of DIC physiology; antibiotics and source control for sepsis, damage-control hemostasis in trauma, urgent disease-modifying therapy for APL, and obstetric management for uteroplacental triggers are each time-critical, and I need to reassess the coagulation profile as the underlying condition is addressed [^112s7rgs] [^111zPzQr] [^111Q1fAh] [^111MUMRC].

> Now, supportive hemostasis should be individualized by bleeding phenotype and procedure risk, and I should avoid reflexive prophylactic transfusion in stable, non-bleeding patients; if there is active bleeding with platelets below about 50×10^9/L, platelet transfusion is reasonable, and for high-risk procedures or high bleeding risk states, lower thresholds may apply but I need to align with ISTH and BCSH guidance and the clinical context rather than a single number [^116EPivo] [^113HurS7] [^111zPzQr].

> For plasma, I should confirm indications before ordering 15–30 mL/kg of FFP: active bleeding with PT/aPTT greater than 1.5 times normal or with low fibrinogen supports FFP use, and similar laboratory derangements in patients who must undergo invasive procedures can justify FFP; if volume overload is a concern and factor repletion is needed, I may consider PCC cautiously, recognizing thrombosis risk in DIC [^114oEurt] [^113mp8oJ] [^116tKR95] [^115Rc1Zh].

> Regarding hypofibrinogenemia, I should double-check that actively bleeding patients with persistent fibrinogen below approximately 1.5 g/L despite FFP warrant targeted replacement with fibrinogen concentrate or cryoprecipitate, and in BCSH guidance severe hypofibrinogenemia below 1 g/L also prompts cryoprecipitate; let me verify that in cancer-associated DIC with ongoing low fibrinogen, two pools of cryoprecipitate or fibrinogen concentrate are reasonable [^111Q1fAh] [^113358Ck] [^111DrADF].

> But wait, antifibrinolytics are tricky in DIC: in general, I should avoid aminocaproic acid or tranexamic acid when there is active intravascular clotting unless I have compelling evidence of a markedly hyperfibrinolytic phenotype and, if DIC is present, pair therapy with heparin; I should confirm hyperfibrinolysis with appropriate testing and remember exceptions such as early trauma within three hours or APL with profound hyperfibrinolysis where selective use may be justified [^111zPzQr] [^112eenZu] [^117XB1ir] [^116Bf9dj] [^1118Eq9a].

> I should now balance thrombosis and bleeding in anticoagulation: for non-bleeding, critically ill patients with DIC, pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis with UFH or LMWH is recommended, whereas when overt thrombosis or thrombotic organ dysfunction predominates, therapeutic anticoagulation can be considered with a preference for LMWH over UFH, and if bleeding risk is high, low-dose UFH strategies may be used without chasing aPTT targets given unreliable monitoring in DIC; hold on, I should verify that therapeutic dosing is avoided when bleeding risk is prohibitive and de-escalated to prophylactic intensity as appropriate [^113wFFzA] [^116Egit2] [^113a2FWT] [^113HQLtH] [^111zPzQr].

> Let me reconsider adjunctive agents: replenishment of physiologic anticoagulants such as antithrombin or use of recombinant thrombomodulin has biologic rationale but inconsistent clinical evidence, so selective, case-by-case consideration is reasonable where guidelines acknowledge uncertainty; regarding recombinant activated protein C, older BCSH guidance discussed its use in severe sepsis with DIC, but ISTH notes insufficient evidence and contemporary practice has moved away from this, particularly in patients at high bleeding risk or severe thrombocytopenia [^111zPzQr] [^112LbMUw] [^112UtUgh] [^1116cdv4] [^1154zsLP].

> Special settings require tailored thresholds and priorities: in cancer-associated DIC, I should maintain higher platelet thresholds during bleeding and procedures, address persistent hypofibrinogenemia with cryoprecipitate or concentrate, and recognize that solid tumors often display a thrombotic phenotype favoring anticoagulation; in sepsis, SIC may precede overt DIC, and purpura fulminans represents a highly thrombotic DIC subtype driven by protein C pathway failure warranting aggressive anticoagulant repletion and anticoagulation; in obstetrics, rapid etiologic control is central; in massive pulmonary embolism, consumptive coagulopathy can mimic or evolve into DIC; in pediatrics, scoring concordance differs and age-specific norms for endogenous anticoagulants affect interpretation and outcome correlations, so I should double-check local pediatric guidance [^115j35Ws] [^114Pv53F] [^111DrADF] [^117Gqdiq] [^11779EQs] [^112CJSTX] [^1178ZX3r] [^1126xY1t] [^114d6sN8].

> Monitoring must be serial because DIC is dynamic: I should repeat platelets, PT/INR, fibrinogen, and D-dimer every 6–12 hours in unstable patients and adjust therapy based on trends, while continually reassessing bleeding, thrombosis, and organ function to decide when to de-escalate transfusions, escalate anticoagulation, or pivot as the phenotype evolves; I need to ensure I apply the ISTH score longitudinally if uncertainty persists [^1112yb6Y] [^114NFaAf].

> Finally, I should double-check emerging frameworks: the 2025 ISTH SSC communication updates the DIC definition to emphasize systemic coagulation activation with dysregulated fibrinolysis and endothelial injury, and introduces a staged, phenotype- and etiology-tailored approach to earlier detection and modified overt DIC criteria, which should refine research stratification and potentially improve outcomes if integrated thoughtfully into practice [^115Gwcb4].

The DIC workup requires a **clinical and laboratory approach** with the ISTH DIC score (platelets, PT, fibrinogen, D-dimer) [^11148vf8] [^117AYd2c] and serial labs to track progression [^1112yb6Y]. Management centers on **treating the underlying cause** and supportive care: transfuse platelets if < 50×10⁹/L with bleeding or < 20×10⁹/L if high risk, give FFP for active bleeding with PT/aPTT > 1.5× normal or fibrinogen < 1.5 g/L, and use cryoprecipitate or fibrinogen concentrate if fibrinogen remains < 1.5 g/L despite FFP [^116EPivo] [^113HurS7] [^114oEurt] [^116tKR95] [^111Q1fAh] [^113358Ck]. Anticoagulation is reserved for predominant thrombosis — prefer LMWH [^116Egit2] — [^113a2FWT] and is contraindicated with active bleeding; monitor laboratory and clinical status closely.

---

## Diagnostic workup

### Clinical assessment

Evaluate the **clinical context** by identifying triggers (sepsis, trauma, malignancy, obstetric complications, severe COVID-19) [^11148vf8] [^1142dGzc], and assess **signs** such as bleeding (petechiae, ecchymoses, mucosal bleeding), thrombosis (digital ischemia, organ dysfunction), and shock.

---

### Laboratory evaluation

The **ISTH DIC score** is the standard, combining routine tests with clinical context [^114NFaAf].

| **Laboratory test** | **Typical findings in DIC** |
|-|-|
| Platelet count | Decreased (< 100×10⁹/L) |
| Prothrombin time (PT) | Prolonged (> 3 seconds above normal) |
| Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) | Prolonged |
| Fibrinogen level | Decreased (< 1.5 g/L) |
| D-dimer/fibrin degradation products (FDPs) | Elevated |
| Peripheral blood smear | Schistocytes (microangiopathic hemolysis) |

---

The **ISTH score** uses platelets, PT, fibrinogen, and D-dimer [^11148vf8]; a score ≥ 5 indicates overt DIC [^117AYd2c]. Serial monitoring entails repeating labs to track **dynamic changes** and guide therapy [^1112yb6Y] [^117Cbrf1].

---

## Management strategies

### General principles

Treat the **underlying cause** — the cornerstone of DIC management [^112s7rgs] — and provide **supportive care** [^11148vf8] with blood products and anticoagulation tailored to bleeding/thrombotic risk [^111cy5Jr].

---

### Blood product transfusion

- **Platelet transfusion**: Give if < 50×10⁹/L with bleeding or < 20×10⁹/L if high risk (e.g. invasive procedures) [^116EPivo] [^113HurS7].
- **Fresh frozen plasma (FFP)**: Use for active bleeding with PT/aPTT > 1.5× normal or fibrinogen < 1.5 g/L [^116tKR95].
- **Cryoprecipitate/fibrinogen concentrate**: Give if fibrinogen remains < 1.5 g/L despite FFP [^111Q1fAh] [^113358Ck].

---

### Anticoagulation therapy

Use **heparin** — prefer therapeutic LMWH or UFH when thrombosis predominates and avoid if bleeding risk is high [^116Egit2] [^113a2FWT] — and provide **prophylactic anticoagulation** with UFH or LMWH for critically ill, non-bleeding patients to prevent VTE [^113wFFzA].

---

### Adjunctive therapies

Adjunctive options may include **antifibrinolytic agents**, with tranexamic acid reserved for severe hyperfibrinolytic bleeding (e.g. leukemia, trauma) [^112eenZu] [^111zPzQr]; **activated protein C** is not routinely recommended and should be considered case by case [^112UtUgh] [^1154zsLP].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Monitoring and follow-up should include **serial laboratory monitoring** [^112DozZL] of platelets, PT/aPTT, fibrinogen, and D-dimer to guide therapy [^1112yb6Y], along with **clinical assessment** for bleeding, thrombosis, and organ dysfunction.

---

## Special considerations

Obstetric DIC requires **rapid identification of the cause** and supportive transfusion with multidisciplinary care [^112CJSTX]. COVID-19-associated DIC warrants **prophylactic anticoagulation** with close monitoring for thrombosis and bleeding [^11148vf8] [^113wFFzA] [^114DWvMh].

---

## Prognosis

Mortality is **high** — particularly with sepsis, trauma, or malignancy — and early recognition and treatment improve outcomes [^11148vf8] [^115G8nHt] [^114JSrDE].

---

DIC diagnosis relies on the ISTH score and clinical context, with management focused on the cause and tailored supportive care; **early recognition and serial monitoring** are essential to reduce morbidity and mortality [^114NFaAf] [^1112yb6Y].

### Guidance for diagnosis and treatment of DIC from harmonization of the recommendations from three guidelines [^116EPivo]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2013). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), specifically concerning platelet transfusion, the ISTH 2013 guidelines recommend administering platelets in patients with DIC who have active bleeding and a platelet count of less than 50×10⁹/L, or in patients at high risk of bleeding with a platelet count of less than 20×10⁹/L.

### Disseminated intravascular coagulation and its immune mechanisms [^11148vf8]. Blood (2022). Low credibility.

Considering the multitude of causative factors, DIC diagnosis is always made in the context of the clinical presentation. Currently, DIC cannot be diagnosed by any single laboratory test, and combinations of clinical biomarkers are used instead. Global coagulation tests, such as activated partial thromboplastin time and prothrombin time (PT), are routinely used in patients with sepsis to assess the consumptive coagulopathy. Although not yet validated for diagnostic use, viscoelastic point-of-care testing allows for rapid and concomitant monitoring of both coagulation and fibrinolysis in patients treated for trauma and, in pilot studies, distinguished between critically ill patients with DIC and patients without DIC.

Three diagnostic algorithms for DIC have been developed, two in Japan and one by the ISTH Standardization Committee. The ISTH diagnostic score for overt DIC is calculated based on platelet count, PT, fibrinogen level, and fibrinogen/fibrin degradation peptides (D-dimer) in conjunction with clinical considerations. A score of 5 or more indicates overt DIC. A simpler DIC score calculated in the first 48 hours using platelet counts and PT could reflect the severity of the underlying disorder.

There have been attempts to establish scoring algorithms to detect early (nonovert, compensated) DIC before it reaches a full-blown, frequently irreversible stage. Biomarkers of thrombin generation (TAT and prothrombin fragment-1 and -2), fibrinolysis activation (plasmin-antiplasmin and D-dimer) are being investigated for this purpose.

### Dielectric blood coagulometry for the early detection of sepsis-induced disseminated intravascular coagulation: A prospective observational study [^116z8ZVe]. Critical Care Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the utility of dielectric blood coagulometry for the early diagnosis of sepsis-induced disseminated intravascular coagulation.

- **Design**: This was a single-center, prospective observational study.

- **Setting**: The study involved patients with sepsis or septic shock at the Tokyo Medical and Dental University Hospital of Medicine, conducted between September 2019 and September 2020.

- **Patients**: Patients were divided into three groups based on the timing of disseminated intravascular coagulation diagnosis according to the Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation score by the Japanese Association for Acute Medicine:
	1) No disseminated intravascular coagulation group.
	2) Late-diagnosed disseminated intravascular coagulation group: not diagnosed with disseminated intravascular coagulation on day 1 but diagnosed within 48 hours after admission.
	3) Disseminated intravascular coagulation group: diagnosed with disseminated intravascular coagulation on day 1.

The study evaluated 80 patients: no disseminated intravascular coagulation, 31 (38.8%); late-diagnosed disseminated intravascular coagulation, 34 (42.5%); disseminated intravascular coagulation, 15 (18.8%).

- **Measurements and main results**: The study compared clinical severity scores and mortality across the groups. It assessed the correlation between the dielectric blood coagulometry-derived coagulation marker, thrombin levels, and Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation score using Spearman rank correlation. The mortality rate was 0% (0/31) in the no disseminated intravascular coagulation group and 35.3% (12/34) in the late-diagnosed disseminated intravascular coagulation group.

### Guidance for diagnosis and treatment of DIC from harmonization of the recommendations from three guidelines [^111zPzQr]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2013). Low credibility.

Three guidelines have recently been published for the diagnosis and treatment of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) in adults. This communication seeks to harmonize the recommendations in these guidelines using a modified GRADE system.

The scoring system for the diagnosis of DIC using global coagulation tests is known to correlate with key clinical observations and outcomes (moderate quality). The cornerstone of DIC treatment is the treatment of the underlying condition (moderate quality).

- **Transfusion of components**: In general, transfusion of platelets or plasma in patients with DIC should be reserved for patients who are bleeding (low quality).

- **Heparin therapy**: Therapeutic doses of heparin should be considered in cases of DIC where clinical features of thrombosis predominate. Heparin is not recommended for those patients with a high risk of bleeding (moderate quality). However, prophylactic doses of unfractionated heparin or low molecular weight heparin are recommended in critically ill and non-bleeding patients with DIC for the prevention of venous thromboembolism (moderate to high quality).

- **Use of antithrombin or recombinant thrombomodulin**: Although further prospective evidence from randomized controlled trials is required, the administration of antithrombin or recombinant thrombomodulin may be considered in certain patients with DIC.

- **Use of antifibrinolytic agents**: In general, patients with DIC should not be treated with antifibrinolytic agents (low quality). However, those who present with severe bleeding, characterized by a markedly hyperfibrinolytic state such as leukemia (low quality) and trauma (moderate quality), may be treated with antifibrinolytic agents.

### Aminocaproic acid [^117XB1ir]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). Low credibility.

Aminocaproic acid should not be used when there is evidence of an active intravascular clotting process. When there is uncertainty as to whether the cause of bleeding is primary fibrinolysis or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), this distinction must be made before administering aminocaproic acid.

- **Tests to differentiate conditions**:

	- Platelet count is usually decreased in DIC but normal in primary fibrinolysis.
	- Protamine paracoagulation test is positive in DIC; a precipitate forms when protamine sulfate is dropped into citrated plasma. The test is negative in the presence of primary fibrinolysis.
	- The euglobulin clot lysis test is abnormal in primary fibrinolysis but normal in DIC.

Aminocaproic acid must not be used in the presence of DIC without concomitant heparin.

### Thrombocytopenia and thrombosis in disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) [^11718YhC]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2009). Low credibility.

Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) results from pathological overstimulation of the coagulation system. Despite multiple triggers, a myriad of laboratory abnormalities, and a clinical presentation ranging from gross hemostatic failure to life-threatening thrombosis, or even both simultaneously, a simplified clinical approach augmented by readily available tests allows for the prompt identification of the process and the elucidation of treatment opportunities.

Platelet counts in DIC may be low, especially in acute sepsis-associated DIC, yet increased in malignancy-associated chronic DIC. Thrombotic risk is not a function of the platelet count, and thrombocytopenia does not protect the patient from thrombosis. The stratification of both thrombotic risk and hemorrhagic risk will be addressed.

### Management of cancer-associated disseminated intravascular coagulation: Guidance from the SSC of the ISTH [^114Pv53F]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2015). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for disseminated intravascular coagulation, more specifically with respect to patients with malignancy, ISTH 2015 guidelines recommend considering the transfusion of 1–2 doses of platelets (commonly from 5 donors or equivalent). This is suggested for patients with DIC at high risk of bleeding, such as during surgery or invasive procedures. Transfusion is considered if the platelet count is < 30×10⁹/L in acute promyelocytic leukemia and < 20×10⁹/L in other cancers.

### Sepsis-induced coagulopathy: A comprehensive narrative review of pathophysiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and management strategies [^115vjQw6]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2024). Low credibility.

Clinical laboratory features and trends in sepsis-induced coagulopathy (SIC) indicate that it is a form of non-overt disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) in septic patients. Intravascular coagulation driven by inflammatory-mediated tissue factor (TF) expression results in thrombin-antithrombin (TAT) complex formation and mild-to-moderate consumption of platelets and endogenous anticoagulants, such as antithrombin III (ATIII). Additionally, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) is significantly elevated, leading to early suppression of fibrinolysis.

The coagulopathy in SIC can progress to overt DIC of a thrombotic phenotype, characterized by overactive clotting and worsening consumption of clotting factors and platelets. Elevated tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) antigen and markers of fibrinolysis, such as d-dimer, characterize overt DIC of a predominant fibrinolytic phenotype. ↔ indicates no change, ↑ indicates mild changes, ↑↑ indicates moderate changes, and ↑↑↑ indicates severe changes.

Abbreviations: ATIII, antithrombin III; DIC, disseminated intravascular coagulation; FDP, fibrin degradation products; PAI-1, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1; SIC, sepsis-induced coagulopathy; TAT, thrombin-antithrombin complex; TF, tissue factor; TFPI, tissue factor pathway inhibitor; tPA, tissue plasminogen activator.

If dysregulated immune-thrombotic responses continue, SIC can progress to overt DIC with gross consumption of fibrinogen, platelets, and antithrombotic proteins. This manifests as a thrombotic, fibrinolytic, or mixed coagulopathy. In DIC with thrombosis, there is overactive clotting and consumption of platelets and fibrinogen with suppressed or balanced fibrinolysis. In DIC with fibrinolysis, there are significantly reduced platelet and fibrinogen levels, although fibrinolytic activity is pronounced.

### Disseminated intravascular coagulation or extended intravascular coagulation in massive pulmonary embolism [^113xgwsE]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2010). Low credibility.

Systemic activation of coagulation may occur in a variety of clinical situations. This coagulation activation might only be detectable by measuring sensitive molecular markers for the activation of coagulation factors and pathways but can become clinically manifest as changes in routine coagulation tests. The spectrum of clinically manifest coagulation activation ranges from a small decrease in platelet count and sub-clinical prolongation of global clotting times to its most extreme form. An example is fulminant disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), characterized by gross laboratory abnormalities and simultaneous widespread microvascular thrombosis and profuse bleeding from various sites.

DIC is not a disease or a symptom but a syndrome, which is always secondary to an underlying disorder. Although these conditions may vary widely, the pathogenesis of DIC seems to follow similar lines. Intravascular fibrin deposition results from tissue factor-mediated thrombin generation that is insufficiently balanced by dysfunctional physiologic anticoagulant mechanisms, such as the antithrombin system and the protein C system. In addition to enhanced fibrin formation, fibrin removal is impaired due to a depression of the fibrinolytic system caused by high circulating levels of the fibrinolytic inhibitor PAI-1.

### Guidance for diagnosis and treatment of DIC from harmonization of the recommendations from three guidelines [^112eenZu]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2013). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), specifically concerning the use of antifibrinolytic agents, the ISTH 2013 guidelines recommend considering the administration of antifibrinolytic agents in patients with DIC. This is particularly advised for those presenting with severe bleeding characterized by a marked hyperfibrinolytic state, such as in cases of leukemia or trauma.

### Rationale for restoration of physiological anticoagulant pathways in patients with sepsis and disseminated intravascular coagulation [^1178Jmcf]. Critical Care Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

In the pathogenesis of disseminated intravascular coagulation, dysfunctional natural anticoagulant pathways appear to play a pivotal role. In this article, we address the mechanisms that contribute to this defect in the regulation of coagulation activation. Furthermore, we explore the experimental and clinical evidence that restoration of these anticoagulant pathways results in clinical improvement.

- **Data sources**: We have searched and reviewed published articles on experimental studies of disseminated intravascular coagulation models in animals and clinical studies in patients with disseminated intravascular coagulation.

- **Data synthesis**: All three major anticoagulant pathways, namely the antithrombin pathway, the protein C system, and tissue factor pathway inhibitor, are defective in sepsis and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Several mechanisms contribute to this defect. Restoration of these pathways, in principle, by administration of coagulation inhibitor concentrates or recombinant anticoagulant factors, appears to ameliorate the coagulation disorder and, more importantly, result in improvement of clinically relevant outcomes, such as a reduction in organ failure and mortality.

- **Conclusions**: Restoration of disrupted physiologic anticoagulant pathways in disseminated intravascular coagulation is not only a logical point of impact in patients with sepsis and an activated coagulation system, but also is associated with improved outcomes in experimental and initial clinical studies.

### Disseminated intravascular coagulation or extended intravascular coagulation in massive pulmonary embolism [^1178ZX3r]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2010). Low credibility.

Massive pulmonary embolism leading to cardiac arrest is associated with consumptive coagulopathy, presenting as disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

- **DIC score relevance**: Recent analyses show that the DIC score can predict mortality in cases of massive clot coagulopathy resulting from extensive pulmonary embolism, highlighting its clinical significance in prognosis and treatment planning.
- **Ongoing discussions**: Recent publications include a rebuttal on the predictive power of the DIC score, coupled with a reply that further delves into its applicability and the dynamics of massive clot coagulopathy due to extensive pulmonary embolism. These discussions indicate a critical evaluation of current diagnostic tools within hematology and cardiovascular medicine.

These articles bring to light the intricacies of consumptive coagulopathy and emphasize the importance of comprehensive diagnostics in critical care settings.

### Disseminated intravascular coagulation and its immune mechanisms [^1118Eq9a]. Blood (2022). Low credibility.

Disseminated intravascular coagulation in noninfectious diseases involves several complex mechanisms:

- **Cancer-associated coagulopathies**: Coagulopathies associated with most cancers are TF-dependent. TF expression by malignant cells and cancer-derived microparticles contributes to tumor progression and metastasis. Some tumors also express a cysteine endopeptidase, cancer procoagulant, which activates FX directly and impairs hemostasis. Circulating carcinoma mucins activate platelets and support prothrombotic, selectin-mediated platelet-leukocyte interactions. Cancer-associated coagulopathy usually exhibits a chronic asymptomatic progression, where clotting factors and platelets are compensated for. Thromboembolic manifestations are more commonly seen with solid tumors, whereas hemorrhagic events predominate in hematologic malignancies. Consumptive coagulopathy or dysregulated activation of plasminogen by annexin II exacerbates bleeding in APL. Whereas patients with metastatic malignancies that display slow-onset thrombotic DIC can benefit from prophylactic heparins, antifibrinolytic agents have been used to limit hemorrhages in hyperfibrinolytic APL patients.

- **Trauma-associated coagulopathy**: The coagulopathy of trauma is triggered by the exposure of perivascular TF after injury and is amplified by DAMPs, hemorrhagic shock, and potential superimposed infection resulting in thrombin generation, platelet activation, and fibrinolytic dysfunction. In early trauma, DIC manifests a hyperfibrinolytic phenotype due to excessive t-PA release from endothelial cells. Consequently, antifibrinolytic agents, such as tranexamic acid, were beneficial when administered during the first 3 hours.

### Disseminated intravascular coagulation: epidemiology, biomarkers, and management [^114JSrDE]. British Journal of Haematology (2021). Low credibility.

Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a systemic activation of the coagulation system, resulting in microvascular thrombosis and simultaneously, potentially life-threatening hemorrhage attributed to the consumption of platelets and coagulation factors. Underlying conditions, such as infection, cancer, or obstetrical complications, are responsible for initiating and propagating the DIC process. This review provides insights into the epidemiology of DIC and an understanding of its pathophysiology. It details the use of diagnostic biomarkers, includes diagnostic recommendations from international medical societies, and provides an overview of emerging diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. Lastly, it offers guidance on management. It is concluded that timely and accurate diagnosis of DIC and its underlying condition is essential for prognosis. Treatment should primarily focus on the underlying cause of DIC, and supportive treatment should be individualized according to the underlying etiology, patient's symptoms, and laboratory records.

### Early detection of disseminated intravascular coagulation during septic shock: A multicenter prospective study [^111cMa5v]. Critical Care Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Inadequate stratification of septic shock patients may result in inappropriate treatment allocation in randomized clinical trials, especially regarding anticoagulant therapies. We previously reported that endothelial-derived microparticles are relevant biomarkers of sepsis-induced disseminated intravascular coagulation. In this validation cohort, we assess microparticles as surrogates of cell activation to improve early disseminated intravascular coagulation diagnosis and patient stratification.

- **Design**: Prospective observational study in septic shock patients.

- **Settings**: Four medical ICUs in university hospitals.

- **Patients and methods**: Two hundred sixty-five patients with septic shock from four ICUs were consecutively enrolled. Disseminated intravascular coagulation was diagnosed according to the Japanese Association for Acute Medicine 2006 score. Endothelial- and leukocyte-derived circulating procoagulant microparticles were isolated and quantified by prothrombinase assay at admission, day 3, and day 7.

- **Intervention**: None.

- **Measurements and main results**: Two hundred fifty-nine patients were analyzed. Sixty-one had disseminated intravascular coagulation at admission, and 32 developed disseminated intravascular coagulation during the first 24 hours after admission. A multiple logistic regression model confirmed that endothelial cell-derived microparticles were associated with disseminated intravascular coagulation: CD105-microparticles (odds ratio, 2.13) and CD31-microparticles (odds ratio, 0.65) (p < 0.05). Furthermore, the CD11a-microparticles to leukocyte ratio evidenced leuko.

### Current concepts in the management of disseminated intravascular coagulation [^114JNY7K]. Thrombosis Research (2012). Low credibility.

Disseminated intravascular coagulation is a clinicopathological syndrome where widespread intravascular coagulation occurs in response to an inciting process. The pathophysiology of this disorder is complex, with thrombin playing an important role as the central regulator of the coagulation process. Since the clinical spectrum of DIC is variable due to its dynamic nature, the laboratory diagnosis should ideally not be based on a single marker or an isolated set of results. The treatment should primarily focus on managing the underlying triggering condition, with blood products used as resuscitative measures. Newer therapeutic modalities have been recently tried with success, although the management of DIC remains a major challenge.

### Disseminated intravascular coagulation and its immune mechanisms [^1125ZaMV]. Blood (2022). Low credibility.

Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a life-threatening thrombohemorrhagic condition triggered by infectious and noninfectious causes. According to the International Society for Thrombosis and Hemostasis (ISTH), DIC is an acquired syndrome characterized by systemic activation of coagulation within the vasculature, leading to microvascular damage and organ dysfunction. The definition emphasizes that DIC originates, develops within, and affects the microvasculature and is not restricted to the site of insult, but spreads throughout the body.

- **Etiology**: DIC is a complication of many disorders, such as severe systemic infections, malignancy, trauma, obstetrical complications, vascular malformations, severe immunological reactions, and heat stroke. Despite a heterogeneous clinical presentation ranging from asymptomatic to mild, to overwhelming thrombosis or bleeding, at its core, DIC follows exposure to or production of procoagulants insufficiently balanced by endogenous anticoagulant and fibrinolytic mechanisms. The excessive activation of thrombin, evidenced by elevated thrombin-antithrombin complexes or prothrombin activation fragments in the circulation, leads to proteolytic fibrinogen conversion and intravascular formation of fibrin. If the usage of clotting factors exceeds the synthetic hepatic output, a consumptive coagulopathy develops that, in conjunction with thrombocytopenia, predicts an elevated risk of bleeding. Intravascular fibrin is counterbalanced by plasmin-mediated fibrinolysis, leading to increased fibrin degradation products (D-dimers).

### Heatstroke-induced coagulopathy: Biomarkers, mechanistic insights, and patient management [^1165MEzH]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Low credibility.

Various diseases, ranging from infectious to malignant ones, accompany coagulopathy. The main factors that induce thrombosis are activated coagulation, inflammation, platelets, and endothelial damage, with their contributions varying depending on the underlying diseases. Common mechanisms include the initial thrombin generation caused by injuries, followed by the release of tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA). The production of plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) determines fibrinolytic levels, ranging from hypo- to hyperfibrinolytic status. Heatstroke-induced coagulopathy is a type of hypofibrinolytic coagulopathy that can lead to a decompensated status, namely disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), if severe enough.

DIC is commonly considered as "consumptive coagulopathy", but the original concept of DIC is "systemic activation in coagulation", potentially with endothelial damage. As previously described, the procoagulant reaction is part of the host defense to a variety of insults and is recognized as a ubiquitous event. The phenotype differs depending on the underlying conditions. For example, COVID-19-associated coagulopathy does not usually fulfill the criteria of overt-DIC. In COVID-19, platelet count, fibrinogen, and prothrombin time remain in the normal range; however, D-dimer and von Willebrand factor levels, along with mean platelet volume, increase, suggesting the presence of upregulated coagulation, endothelial damage, and platelet activation. Similarly, even if global coagulation markers do not change significantly, heatstroke-induced coagulopathy may present with similar characteristics, yet the text appears truncated at this point.

### How we manage a high D-dimer [^1144PcsQ]. Haematologica (2024). Low credibility.

The proposed management of ambulatory individuals with high D-dimer focuses on addressing the complexities of this condition. While D-dimer plays a clear role in diagnosing acute illnesses such as VTE, DIC, and sepsis, managing ambulatory individuals presenting with high D-dimer levels but no evidence of thrombosis remains a challenge. This issue has become more prominent due to the widespread use of D-dimer testing during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.

When an ostensibly healthy and asymptomatic person is referred for persistently high D-dimer, it is crucial to reassure them by explaining all possible non-disease-related causes for this abnormality. However, an abnormal D-dimer should not be disregarded in asymptomatic individuals. Such patients should have access to differential diagnostic procedures, considering all potential conditions associated with increased D-dimer as part of the diagnostic process.

### Identification of hemostatic markers that define the pre-DIC state: A multi-center observational study [^116o6UxA]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2020). Low credibility.

A limitation of diagnostic scoring systems for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is that once DIC is identified, it may be in a state of irreversible deterioration.

- **Objectives**: To identify hemostatic markers that can identify the pre-DIC state.

- **Methods**: This was a multi-center observational study of 357 septic patients. The incidence of DIC was determined using the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) DIC Score. Markers of interest include components of the DIC score: protein C (PC), antithrombin (AT), and citrullinated histones (H3Cit), which is a marker of NETosis.

- **Results**: Out of 357 sepsis patients, 236 patients did not develop DIC (without-DIC), 79 patients had DIC on Day 1 (overt-DIC), and 42 patients developed DIC after Day 1 (pre-DIC). Compared to without-DIC patients, pre-DIC patients had decreased platelet count, increased international normalized ratio (INR), decreased PC and AT, and increased H3Cit. In contrast, D-dimer and fibrinogen levels did not differ between pre-DIC and without-DIC patients. Using receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis, we found that platelet count and INR in combination with PC and AT could discriminate pre-DIC from without-DIC. The area under the curve in the ROC analysis was 0.83 (95% confidence interval, 0.76 to 0.89).

- **Conclusion**: Our study suggests that platelets and INR in combination with PC and AT can identify the pre-DIC state in septic patients. In contrast, D-dimer increased and fibrinogen decreased in the late (i.e. overt) stages of DIC. Our data also suggest that NETos…

### Practical guide to the diagnosis and management of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia [^114WNZwX]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2024). High credibility.

Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is an immune reaction to heparin associated with thrombocytopenia, thrombotic risk, and a high risk of morbidity and mortality. Given the frequent use of heparin and the common occurrence of thrombocytopenia in hospitalized patients, the diagnosis and management of HIT is a challenge in everyday inpatient care. This article presents practical guidance and tools to support the individual clinician providing evidence-based care to patients with suspected or confirmed HIT.

The optimal diagnostic evaluation requires the stepwise use of risk-stratification tools and laboratory assays. Management requires the selection and use of non-heparin anticoagulation in these complex patients with both increased thrombotic risk and possible increased bleeding risk due to thrombocytopenia. Each step in the diagnostic and management process has important nuances and complexities, many of which vary based on patient characteristics and institutional resources.

Given the many challenges of HIT care, truly practical management is best achieved when tools are implemented to support the delivery of consistent, high quality, and cost-effective care across health systems.

### Microvascular thrombosis and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome [^116qC8os]. Critical Care Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

This paper reviews the involvement of disseminated intravascular coagulation-induced microvascular thrombosis in the pathogenesis of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome and the interaction between disseminated intravascular coagulation and systemic inflammatory response syndrome in critically ill patients. The published literature on clinical and experimental studies serves as the data source for the study. Histologic evidence of microvascular thrombosis and tissue injury in disseminated intravascular coagulation has been reported in clinical, experimental, and autopsy findings. Proinflammatory cytokine-evoked neutrophil-endothelial activation and the interplay between inflammation and coagulation through protease-activated receptors contribute to enhanced microvascular fibrin deposition in organs.

In a clinical setting, systemic inflammatory response syndrome and disseminated intravascular coagulation synergistically play pivotal roles in the development of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome and in the poor prognosis of critical illness. Disseminated intravascular coagulation contributes to microvascular thrombosis and subsequent multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. Recent knowledge on the relationship between disseminated intravascular coagulation and systemic inflammatory response syndrome provides further insight into the pathogenic mechanisms of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome in critically ill patients.

The SIC score was designed for earlier identification of patients with coagulopathy who have an elevated risk of deterioration from nonovert to overt DIC, which explains its high sensitivity. Given that diagnosis of SIC using the SIC score preceded a diagnosis of overt DIC, once this patient subset is identified, they may be followed using the ISTH overt DIC score, which carries a higher specificity. A combination of the SIC score with the ISTH DIC score may allow for earlier detection of SIC and institution of therapy before progression to overt DIC.

Regarding the medical management of disseminated intravascular coagulation, specifically concerning intravenous heparin, the BCSH 2009 guidelines recommend considering the administration of continuous infusion unfractionated heparin (UFH) in patients with a perceived coexisting high risk of bleeding. Administer weight-adjusted doses, such as 10 mcg/kg/hour, without the intention of prolonging the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) ratio to 1.5–2.5 times the control. It is important to observe clinical signs of bleeding, as monitoring the aPTT in these patients may be complicated.

### Disseminated intravascular coagulation and its immune mechanisms [^1157NWCr]. Blood (2022). Low credibility.

Pathogens, dead cells, and their derived molecular pattern molecules (PAMPs and DAMPs) can signal through PRRs to induce TF expression and microparticle release from monocytes, promoting the synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines. This process further amplifies TF expression, thus initiating coagulation via the extrinsic pathway. In parallel, contact activation with FXIIa generation can occur on the surface of pathogens, PAMPs, DAMPs, and cell debris. Particularly, bacteria-derived long-chain polyphosphates (LC-poly-Ps), platelet-derived short-chain polyphosphates (SC-poly-P), and extracellular nucleic acids (DNA/RNA) can induce contact-mediated autoactivation of FXII and trigger coagulation via the intrinsic pathway. Both pathways converge into the common coagulation mechanism, leading to thrombin generation and downstream platelet activation, fibrin, and thrombus formation.

The hypercoagulant state in DIC is enhanced by dysregulation of endothelial homeostasis and the anticoagulant networks that control the initiation, amplification, and termination of clotting reactions. Clotting initiation is controlled by TF pathway inhibitor (TFPI), a Kunitz type inhibitor primarily exposed on endothelium and, to a lesser extent, on platelets and monocytes. In the presence of FXa, the quaternary TF-FVIIa-FXa-TFPI complex inhibits both FXa and FVIIa proteolytic activities. During the clinical course of DIC, cell-associated TFPI is cleaved by proteases, leading to a progressive increase in plasma TFPI, mostly truncated and devoid of anticoagulant function.

### How I diagnose and treat acute infection-associated purpura fulminans [^11779EQs]. Blood (2025). High credibility.

Purpura fulminans (PF) is a rare but devastating complication of sepsis, characterized by a highly thrombotic subtype of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). As a medical emergency, PF often requires the involvement of consultant hematologists to assist with the diagnosis and management of patients in a highly dynamic and deteriorating clinical situation. Patients who survive past the first 24 to 72 hours often die from complications of unchecked thrombosis rather than shock, and survivors are usually left with severe scarring and tissue loss.

Despite these challenging features, PF is a pathophysiologically distinct, homogeneous, and highly predictable form of sepsis-associated DIC, for which poor outcomes are not a foregone conclusion. The fundamental pathologic lesion in PF is a failure of the anticoagulant protein C pathway, leading to uncontrolled microvascular clotting and inadequate protein C-mediated cytoprotective effects, which are vital for survival in sepsis.

Herein, we review the clinical features and diagnosis of PF. Drawing from existing clinical literature and recent advances in our understanding of the pathophysiology of PF, we describe rationally designed treatment approaches for this disorder. These include repletion of natural circulating anticoagulants, use of therapeutic anticoagulation, and ways to optimize transfusion support. Additionally, we outline specific interventions that we would recommend avoiding.

### Sepsis-induced coagulopathy: A comprehensive narrative review of pathophysiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and management strategies [^1177rNxL]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2024). Low credibility.

Coagulation testing in sepsis-induced coagulopathy:

Diagnostic criteria for sepsis-induced coagulopathy (SIC) do not include evaluation of endogenous anticoagulants, the fibrinolytic-antifibrinolytic system, inflammation, or endothelial activation. Recent work has identified new metrics for SIC, including markers of inflammation (e.g. vascular endothelial growth factor and IL-6:IL-10 ratio), infection (e.g. procalcitonin), endothelial function (e.g. endocan), and platelet activation (e.g. platelet factor-4), which have strong predictive ability for mortality (AUC, 0.87). An experimental scoring system, including plasma levels of endothelial cell-derived microparticles, platelet count, and PT, demonstrated a negative predictive value for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) of 93% at admission, allowing early stratification of coagulopathy risk development in septic patients. Such markers may provide more precise characterization but have not been widely validated to distinguish SIC from other forms of DIC, nor are they readily available for routine testing. Therefore, no recommendations currently exist for routine measurements beyond standard coagulation testing.

Thromboelastography (TEG) or rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) may be useful as a diagnostic screen in SIC; however, a majority of studies focus on capturing overt DIC. Patients with overt DIC had reduced maximum clot firmness (MCF) on ROTEM compared to those without DIC, and MCF demonstrated a high sensitivity for DIC diagnosis. A 2021 meta-analysis evaluated 11 observational studies using TEG or ROTEM and found that a hypocoagulable profile (reduced MCF) was a valid parameter associated with mortality in septic patients.

### Updated definition and scoring of disseminated intravascular coagulation in 2025: Communication from the ISTH SSC Subcommittee on Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation [^115Gwcb4]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2025). High credibility.

Compelling evidence supports the need to update the 2001 definition and diagnosis of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) to reflect our understanding of disease pathophysiology. DIC has long been considered a critical and untreatable sequela of various underlying causes, with resolution only after treatment of the eliciting etiology. Recent views have evolved to appreciate that DIC-associated mortality may be reduced by detection and treatment at an early stage.

The International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis Scientific and Standardization Committee on DIC proposes an updated definition of DIC: "an acquired, life-threatening intravascular disorder characterized by systemic coagulation activation, dysregulated fibrinolysis, and endothelial injury, resulting in microthrombosis". DIC arises from various underlying etiologies and progresses from a potentially asymptomatic early phase to an advanced phase with hemorrhage and/or organ dysfunction.

In accordance with this more comprehensive definition, we propose to establish more tailored diagnostic criteria that detect early-phase DIC based on the underlying disease. We also propose a modification to overt DIC diagnostic criteria and scoring for late-phase DIC. These consensus-driven modifications reflect knowledge obtained since the original 2001 definition, which advanced clinical practice and research on DIC.

This revised framework is anticipated to foster more precise and earlier diagnoses, improve patient stratification in clinical studies, and facilitate the development of targeted therapies.

### Disseminated intravascular coagulation and its immune mechanisms [^112PN5w5]. Blood (2022). High credibility.

The role of genomic variation in the incidence and phenotypic expression of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) has been underinvestigated at the time of writing. With the expansion of genomic sequencing, associations between polymorphisms and DIC are expected to multiply during the next decade, particularly in cancer-associated DIC. Integration of genetic data, biomarker dynamics, and clinical outcomes will not be trivial. It is likely to require machine learning algorithms and collaboration among computer scientists, basic science researchers, and clinical researchers to tailor individualized therapies for patients.

### Disseminated intravascular coagulation and its immune mechanisms [^1133hxAt]. Blood (2022). Low credibility.

The pathogenesis of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is complex and multifactorial, involving overlapping host defense pathways such as uncontrolled activation of coagulation, platelets, fibrinolysis, complement, innate immunity, and inflammation. This occurs within a dysfunctional microcirculation characterized by widespread endotheliopathy.

- **Initiation of coagulation**: Blood coagulation is primarily triggered by the exposure of tissue factor (TF) to coagulation factor (F) VII/VIIa circulating in the plasma. In conditions such as sepsis, and likely other pathologies, activation of the contact pathway can also contribute to the initiation and amplification of coagulopathic and inflammatory responses. TF is constitutively expressed outside the vasculature, where it forms a protective hemostatic envelope, but is normally repressed on vascular cells. Inducible TF expression in monocytes, platelets, granulocytes, lymphocytes, and endothelial cells has been reported. Monocytes are considered the primary source of intravascular TF in DIC, whereas TF transcription in other vascular cells has been challenged. Multiple immune signaling networks promote intravascular TF expression. During systemic infections, the induction of monocyte TF is a primary immune response initiated by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) binding pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and/or host-derived damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), or by activating immunoglobulin Fc receptors. PRR signaling supports overlapping procoagulant and pro-inflammatory profiles.

### Disseminated intravascular coagulation and its immune mechanisms [^114hQSn9]. Blood (2022). High credibility.

Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a syndrome triggered by infectious and non-infectious pathologies, characterized by excessive generation of thrombin within the vasculature and widespread proteolytic conversion of fibrinogen. Despite diverse clinical manifestations ranging from thrombo-occlusive damage to bleeding diathesis, DIC etiology commonly involves excessive activation of blood coagulation, alongside overlapping dysregulation of anticoagulants and fibrinolysis.

Initiation of blood coagulation follows intravascular expression of tissue factor or activation of the contact pathway in response to pathogen-associated or host-derived damage-associated molecular patterns. The process is further amplified through inflammatory and immunothrombotic mechanisms. Consumption of anticoagulants and disruption of endothelial homeostasis lower regulatory control and disseminate microvascular thrombosis.

Clinical DIC development in patients is associated with worsening morbidities and increased mortality, regardless of the underlying pathology; therefore, timely recognition of DIC is critical for reducing the pathologic burden. Due to the diversity of triggers and pathogenic mechanisms leading to DIC, diagnosis is based on algorithms that quantify hemostatic imbalance, thrombocytopenia, and fibrinogen conversion. Because the diagnosis primarily assesses overt consumptive coagulopathies, there is a critical need for better recognition of non-overt DIC and/or pre-DIC states.

Therapeutic strategies for patients with DIC involve resolution of the eliciting triggers and support.

### Diagnosis and treatment of disseminated intravascular coagulation: Guidelines of the Italian Society for Haemostasis and Thrombosis (SISET) [^112LbMUw]. Thrombosis Research (2012). Low credibility.

The diagnosis and treatment of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) remain extremely controversial. The Italian Society for Thrombosis and Haemostasis commissioned a project to develop clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of DIC.

- **Methods**: Key questions about the diagnosis and treatment of DIC were formulated by a multidisciplinary working group consisting of experts in clinical medicine and research. After a systematic review and discussion of the literature, recommendations were formulated and graded according to the supporting evidence. In the absence of evidence, evidence of low quality, or contradictory evidence, a formal consensus method was used to issue clinical recommendations.

- **Results and conclusions**: In suspected DIC, we suggest the use of the diagnostic scores ISTH (grade C), JMHW (grade C), or JAAM (grade D) over standalone tests. The cornerstone of the management of DIC remains the treatment of the underlying triggering disease. We do not suggest the use of antithrombin (grade D), dermatan sulphate (grade D), gabexate (grade D), recombinant factor VIIa (grade D), activated protein C (grade D), thrombomodulin (grade B). The use of unfractionated heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin is not suggested except for thromboembolic prophylaxis in patients at high risk who do not have active bleeding (grade D). In patients with severe sepsis/septic shock and DIC, we suggest the use of human recombinant activated protein C (grade D). In patients with DIC and active bleeding, we suggest the use of transfusion therapy.

### Evaluation of disseminated intravascular coagulation scores in critically ill pediatric patients [^1126xY1t]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Disseminated intravascular coagulation is a complex systemic thrombohemorrhagic disorder, which may contribute to organ failure. We aimed to compare the detection rate of disseminated intravascular coagulation, early in the course of ICU admission, of the two disseminated intravascular coagulation scoring systems defined by the International Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis and Japanese Association for Acute Medicine criteria, and the prognostic value of disseminated intravascular coagulation scores in critically ill pediatric patients.

- **Design**: Single-center retrospective observational study.
- **Setting**: PICU in a tertiary care children's hospital.
- **Patients**: Pediatric patients admitted to the PICU between January 2013 and December 2014.
- **Interventions**: None.
- **Measurements and main results**: A total of 191 patients were included. Among them, 15.7% and 29.8% of the patients were diagnosed with disseminated intravascular coagulation by the International Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis and Japanese Association for Acute Medicine criteria, respectively. The diagnostic concordance rate between these scoring systems was 52.6%. As the Pediatric Risk of Mortality III, the modified Sequential Organ Failure Assessment, and the Pediatric Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome scores increased, the percentage of patients with disseminated intravascular coagulation increased stepwise. The disseminated intravascular coagulation scores correlated well with these severity scores.

### Mechanisms and management of coagulopathy in acute promyelocytic leukemia [^111MUMRC]. Thrombosis Research (2018). Low credibility.

Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is a subtype of leukemia associated with unique and distinctive coagulopathy. Without treatment, it is rapidly fatal, and even after initiating therapy, the major cause of early mortality is related to hemorrhagic complications. The coagulopathy can be exacerbated with the start of treatment. In the absence of early hemorrhage-related deaths, the probability of cure exceeds 90% in low and intermediate-risk patients and 80% even in high-risk patients. This highlights the importance of understanding the pathophysiology of this complication and instituting prompt and appropriate management strategies.

The coagulopathy in APL is complex, resulting from a combination of thrombocytopenia, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and hyperfibrinolysis. Recently, the effect of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)-induced ETosis on exacerbating coagulopathy in the first few days after starting therapy with this agent raises the potential for novel strategies to reduce the risk of hemorrhage. Currently, management is mainly related to the rapid initiation of therapy with ATRA, along with appropriate and adequate replacement of blood products to correct the coagulopathy. There is a limited role for the use of low-dose anticoagulants and antifibrinolytic agents in the initial management of this disease. Additionally, there is limited data on the use of rFVIIa or the use of global tests of hemostasis in the management of this condition.

### Comparison of diagnostic criteria for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC): Diagnostic criteria of the International Society of Thrombosis and Hemostasis and of the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare for overt DIC [^117AYd2c]. American Journal of Hematology (2003). High credibility.

The ISTH criteria for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a clinical tool designed to aid in the diagnosis of DIC, a complex systemic thrombohemorrhagic disorder. The tool is particularly useful in stratifying patients based on the severity of their coagulation abnormalities, thereby facilitating timely and appropriate therapeutic interventions.

The ISTH DIC criteria incorporates four primary components: platelet count, fibrinogen degradation product level, prothrombin time (PT) prolongation, and fibrinogen level. Each component is scored based on the severity of the abnormality. For platelet count, a score of 0 is assigned for counts greater than or equal to 100 x10^9/L, 1 for counts between 51–100 x10^9/L, and 2 for counts less than or equal to 50 x10^9/L. Fibrinogen degradation product level is scored as 0 for less than 10 µg/mL, 2 for levels between 10–25 µg/mL, 3 for 25–50 µg/mL, and 4 for levels greater than 50 µg/mL.

Prothrombin time (PT) prolongation is scored as 0 for less than 3 seconds, 1 for 3–6 seconds, and 2 for greater than 6 seconds. Lastly, fibrinogen level is scored as 0 for greater than 1 g/L and 1 for less than or equal to 1 g/L.

The total score is calculated by summing the scores from each of the four components. A score of less than 5 suggests that the criteria for DIC are not met, while a score of 5 or more meets the criteria for DIC. This scoring system allows for a standardized and objective assessment of DIC, which can be challenging to diagnose due to its variable clinical presentation and the lack of a single definitive diagnostic test.

**Problem**: Admitting doctors are often criticized for the inappropriate use of investigations in the early stages of diagnosis. This not only wastes resources but delays correct diagnosis and, in some cases, can be harmful to patients. The unnecessary measurement of D-dimer in cases of pulmonary embolism (PE) is particularly high.

### Antithrombin and activated protein C in pediatric sepsis: Prospective observational study of outcome [^114d6sN8]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2025). High credibility.

To assess antithrombin and activated protein C (aPC) levels in relation to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and severe outcomes in pediatric sepsis, a prospective, observational study was conducted between April 2023 and October 2024. Coagulation profiles, including conventional coagulation, antithrombin activity, and aPC, were obtained at PICU admission. The study was set in the PICU of the Vietnam National Children's Hospital in Hanoi, Vietnam, involving PICU admissions of children aged from 1 month to 18 years who presented with sepsis.

One hundred thirty children (78 males; median age 7.5 months) were included, with a mortality rate of 23 out of 130 (17.7%). The prevalence of overt DIC was 37 out of 130 (28.5%). Nonsurvival at 28 days, compared with survival, was associated with hemorrhage and/or thrombosis at presentation, a higher number of dysfunctional organs, and overt DIC. Those with overt DIC had longer activated partial thromboplastin time, higher international normalized ratio, higher d-dimer levels, and lower antithrombin and aPC levels compared to those without DIC. The activity of antithrombin and aPC correlated inversely with the Vasoactive-Inotropic Score in survivors (p = 0.002 and 0.009, respectively).

Patients with a cutoff value for antithrombin less than 63.5% had a mortality risk with an area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve of 0.64, with a sensitivity of 0.51, specificity of 0.74, and positive predictive value of 0.30. Regarding overt DIC, a cutoff value for antithrombin less than 55.5% had an AUROC of 0.78, sensitivity of 0.72, specificity of 0.73, and positive predictive value.

### Patient blood management during the COVID-19 pandemic: A narrative review [^114DWvMh]. Anaesthesia (2020). Low credibility.

Several reports describe coagulation alterations in patients hospitalized with COVID‐19 infection. In these reports, prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time were longer in COVID‐19‐infected versus non‐infected individuals. Moreover, more abnormal coagulation parameters were found in advanced disease states and in non‐survivors compared with survivors, along with elevated fibrinogen concentrations. Markedly elevated D‐dimers were described as the most prominent characteristic, a finding interpreted as overt disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). A subset of patients with the most severe COVID‐19 are prone to develop consumptive coagulopathy and a hypercoagulable state.

Furthermore, the most severely affected COVID‐19 patients may require extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) for respiratory or cardiac failure. This treatment can be life‐saving but also transfusion‐intensive, with anecdotal reports of frequent clotting within the ECMO circuits. As new insights are gained about the pathophysiology of these prothrombotic alterations in COVID‐19 patients, it will be important to adapt therapy accordingly. Early prehospital low‐dose aspirin or early in‐hospital low molecular weight heparin have been proposed as preemptive treatment strategies. However, premature and unsubstantiated changes in therapeutic concepts should be avoided when based merely on anecdotal reports, as the consequences may be deleterious.

### Current consideration and management of disseminated intravascular coagulation [^11768YJY]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology, Education Program (2013). Low credibility.

Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a devastating clinical condition characterized by the loss of normal hemostatic control in response to sustained and systemic cell injury. The inciting injury may arise from infection, trauma, or malignancy. The consequent pathophysiology is multifactorial, involving intertwined feedback loops among the coagulant, immune, and inflammatory pathways. Central to this is thrombin generation; however, the ubiquitous nature of its in vivo functional consequences can make it challenging to separate the overlapping components of this clinical problem. Therefore, early recognition and resolution of the precipitating events leading to DIC remains central to clinical care.

This article refreshes our understanding of DIC pathogenesis and highlights recent advances in the cycle of cell death caused by extracellular nuclear proteins. It also aims to delineate recognition of response pathways that can be predominantly procoagulant or profibrinolytic, enabling a more personalized and evidence-based approach to be delivered to patients with DIC.

### Management of disseminated intravascular coagulation: A survey of the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis [^113R6oh3]. Thrombosis Research (2015). Low credibility.

It is not clear if and how international guidelines on the management of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) are translated into routine clinical practice.

- **Materials and methods**: A survey was conducted among different specialists who treat DIC. The survey examined six hypothetical case scenarios, including the diagnosis of DIC, the treatment of non-overt and overt DIC with or without thrombosis, and the management of DIC patients at risk of bleeding or actively bleeding.

- **Results**: There were 191 respondents and 73 returned complete questionnaires. Most of the respondents were specialists in hematology (48%) or intensive care (30%). In suspected overt or non-overt DIC, only one-third use formal diagnostic scores, while two-thirds rely on a broad panel of coagulation tests independently of any score. In non-overt DIC, 68% provide no treatment but monitor laboratory tests. Monitoring was considered by 48% of respondents in overt DIC without thrombosis or bleeding. When a thrombotic or bleeding complication ensues, 29% consider intervening only if the event is major. In DIC patients judged at risk of bleeding, 67% use prophylactic transfusions, mostly fresh-frozen plasma (73%) and platelets (65%). Active bleeding is often managed with fresh-frozen plasma (83%) and platelet transfusions (68%) as the first line and recombinant activated factor VII (31%) as the second line treatment.

- **Conclusions**: This survey shows a largely heterogeneous approach of clinicians to the diagnosis and management of DIC. There is limited use of diagnostic scores despite guidelines' recommendations.

### Sepsis-induced coagulopathy: A comprehensive narrative review of pathophysiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and management strategies [^117S1D8M]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2024). High credibility.

Sepsis-induced coagulopathy (SIC) is a major complication in sepsis. It is present in 24% of patients with sepsis and is associated with a two-fold increase in mortality. SIC is characterized by systemic inflammation and coagulation activation, leading to microvascular thrombi, impaired organ perfusion, and subsequent organ dysfunction. While SIC is often used synonymously with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), DIC involves overt consumptive intravascular coagulopathy, which means significant reductions in platelets, fibrinogen, and clotting factors, with clinical evidence of thrombotic and/or bleeding diatheses. In comparison, SIC is a type of non-overt DIC, described by systemic intravascular coagulation, but without gross consumption of platelets, fibrinogen, and clotting factors. SIC often preempts the decompensated coagulopathy of DIC.

SIC is a complex condition triggered by pathological interactions between the innate immune and coagulation systems. However, a detailed understanding of the normal and dysregulated interactions of these systems and their components is needed to improve diagnostic accuracy and develop targeted therapeutics. This represents a significant knowledge gap in SIC and is the goal of ongoing research. This article critically reviews the literature on SIC in the following areas:

- **Experimental evidence**: The role of pathogen- and host-derived inflammatory molecules linked to hemostatic activation in sepsis.
- **Systemic impact**: The dysregulated immunothrombotic responses and resultant clinical presentations.

The review indicates the urgent need for further studies to enhance therapeutic approaches targeting the intricate mechanisms of SIC.

### How we manage a high D-dimer [^112DozZL]. Haematologica (2024). Low credibility.

Disseminated intravascular coagulation is a severe, often life-threatening syndrome characterized by diffuse and persistent activation of the hemostatic system with intravascular thrombin generation and fibrin formation and degradation. Early recognition of DIC is crucial to allow prompt treatment, the primary aim of which is to eliminate the underlying condition (e.g. sepsis, malignancy, trauma, obstetric diseases). D-dimer has become a cornerstone in the diagnosis of DIC because, thanks to its excellent negative predictive value, the use of D-dimer measurement in this context has been endorsed by all national and international guidelines. For example, the International Society of Thrombosis and Hemostasis (ISTH) not only validated a scoring system (including prothrombin time, platelet count, fibrinogen, and D-dimer levels) for its diagnostic and prognostic value but also recommended sequential D-dimer measurements to monitor DIC evolution and to guide clinical and therapeutic management.

- **Cancer, inflammation, and infection**: The activation of coagulation is a common finding in malignant tumors, being associated with growth and progression. As a consequence, up to 20% of cancer patients develop VTE, which is the second leading cause of death. D-dimer is over-produced in the presence of active malignancy and levels are increased in a variety of tumors. However, the common finding of high D-dimer in cancer even in the absence of thrombosis limits the diagnostic usefulness of this test. Nevertheless, incorporating D-dimer measurement…

### Frequency and hemostatic abnormalities in pre-DIC patients [^112933VE]. Thrombosis Research (2010). Low credibility.

Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) sometimes has a poor outcome, and therefore early diagnosis and treatment are required. This study prospectively evaluated the hemostatic abnormalities and the onset of DIC in 613 patients with underlying diseases to identify a useful marker for diagnosing pre-DIC. Pre-DIC was defined as the condition of patients within a week before the onset of DIC. Initially, 34.4% of patients were diagnosed with DIC, and about 8.5% of the patients without DIC were later diagnosed as pre-DIC within a week after registration. The mortality rates were 35.3% for DIC, 32.4% for pre-DIC, and 17.2% for those without DIC.

All hemostatic parameters were significantly worse in the DIC group compared to those without DIC. The values of the prothrombin time ratio, platelet count, and fibrin monomer complex could classify the patients into the groups: DIC, pre-DIC, and without DIC. However, no useful marker was identified that provided an adequate cutoff value to differentiate pre-DIC from those without DIC. A multivariate analysis identified clinical symptoms that were related to poor outcomes. It is critical that DIC be treated immediately, yet there is no specific marker to identify pre-DIC.

Regarding medical management for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), more specifically with respect to intravenous heparin, the BCSH 2009 guidelines recommend considering the administration of therapeutic doses of heparin in patients with DIC where thrombosis predominates. This includes situations such as arterial or venous thromboembolism (VTE), severe purpura fulminans associated with acral ischemia, or vascular skin infarction.

### Disseminated intravascular coagulation in pregnancy: Insights in pathophysiology, diagnosis and management [^112CJSTX]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2015). Low credibility.

Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a life-threatening situation that can arise from a variety of obstetrical and non-obstetrical causes. Obstetrical DIC has been associated with a series of pregnancy complications including acute peripartum hemorrhage, such as uterine atony, cervical and vaginal lacerations, and uterine rupture; placental abruption; preeclampsia/eclampsia/hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count syndrome; retained stillbirth; septic abortion and intrauterine infection; amniotic fluid embolism; and acute fatty liver of pregnancy.

Prompt diagnosis and understanding of the underlying mechanisms leading to this complication are essential for a favorable outcome. In recent years, novel diagnostic scores and treatment modalities, along with bedside point-of-care tests, have been developed and may assist clinicians in the diagnosis and management of DIC. Teamwork and prompt treatment are essential for the successful management of patients with DIC.

### Trends in the incidence and outcomes of disseminated intravascular coagulation in critically ill patients (2004–2010): a population-based study [^115G8nHt]. Chest (2013). High credibility.

Disseminated intravascular coagulation is a disease that can be associated with various clinical and laboratory findings, conditions, and complications:

- **Clinical presentations**: decreased platelet count, hemorrhagic bullae, mucosal bleeding, gangrene, eschar, erythematous macules, petechiae, geographic plaques, limb ischemia, purpura fulminans, purpura

- **Laboratory findings**: schistocytes, increased prothrombin time (PT), positive International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) criteria, increased partial thromboplastin time (PTT), increased plasma D-dimer, decreased serum fibrinogen

- **Associated conditions**: pregnancy, pancreatic cancer, liver cirrhosis, malignancy, acute pancreatitis, acute liver failure (ALF), traumatic injury, sepsis, intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), acute promyelocytic leukemia

- **Complications**: internal bleeding

Each of these elements plays a significant role in either the diagnosis or consequence of this disease.

### Disseminated intravascular coagulation [^113hX7Xt]. Critical Care Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

The objective of this study is to review the knowledge on the clinical manifestation, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

- **Data source**: Selected articles from the MEDLINE database have been used.

- **Data synthesis**: DIC may complicate a variety of disorders, causing significant morbidity, particularly related to organ dysfunction and bleeding, and may contribute to mortality. The pathogenesis of DIC is based on tissue factor-mediated initiation of systemic coagulation activation that is insufficiently contained by physiologic anticoagulant pathways and amplified by impaired endogenous fibrinolysis. The diagnosis of DIC can be made using routinely available laboratory tests and scoring algorithms. Supportive treatment of DIC may be aimed at the replacement of platelets and coagulation factors, anticoagulant treatment, and restoration of anticoagulant pathways.

Insight into the pathogenesis of DIC has resulted in better strategies for clinical management, including straightforward diagnostic criteria and potentially beneficial supportive treatment options.

### Disseminated intravascular coagulation and its immune mechanisms [^1142dGzc]. Blood (2022). Low credibility.

The intravascular coagulopathy commonly observed in severe SARS-CoV-2 infections, which frequently exhibit non-overt disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), can trigger both thrombotic and bleeding complications. The progressive d-dimer elevation documented in non-surviving patients with COVID-19 indicates active coagulopathy, associates with hyperinflammatory markers, and predicts thrombotic complications and mortality. Elevated d-dimer accompanied by thrombocytopenia predicts an enhanced bleeding risk. No significant changes in the results of global coagulation tests and fibrinogen levels were observed between patients with or without coagulopathic COVID-19, indicating compensatory hepatic synthesis of clotting factors. The coagulopathic mechanisms in COVID-19 are under active investigation.

Because endothelial cells harbor the ACE-2 receptor, SARS-CoV-2 can directly infect the endothelium promoting endotheliopathy and microvascular thrombosis. Unlike SARS-CoV-1, which replicates and triggers tissue factor (TF) transcription in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, SARS-CoV-2 replication in monocytes has not been confirmed. Nevertheless, intravascular TF can be induced by platelet-monocyte aggregates in patients with COVID-19.

We learned that inflammatory mediators, complement, and autoimmune mechanisms could amplify the coagulopathy, but such findings will require mechanistic confirmation in experimental models. Thus, anticoagulants can benefit patients with prothrombotic COVID-19, but coagulopathic monitoring is still necessary to prevent bleeding. At the moment, the American Society of Hematology recommends prophylactic-intensity anticoagulants for prevention.

### Modified non-overt DIC diagnostic criteria predict the early phase of overt-DIC [^115AJiNc]. American Journal of Hematology (2010). Low credibility.

Diagnostic criteria for non-overt disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) have been proposed by the International Society of Thrombosis and Hemostasis, but they are not useful for diagnosing the early phase of overt-DIC (pre-DIC). Therefore, in this study, the non-overt DIC diagnostic criteria were modified using global coagulation tests, the change rate in these global tests, and molecular hemostatic markers to detect the pre-DIC state. They were then prospectively evaluated in 613 patients with underlying DIC disease. The frequencies of patients with DIC (DIC positive), late onset DIC, and without DIC (DIC absent) were 29.5%, 7.2%, and 63.3%, respectively. The modified non-overt DIC criteria can correctly predict 43 out of 44 patients (97.7%) who were DIC absent at admission and became DIC positive within a week (late onset DIC state). The mortality rate was higher in DIC positive patients compared with pre-DIC (37.6% vs. 22.7%, P < 0.05) or DIC negative patients (37.6% vs. 13.7%, P < 0.01). It was also significantly higher in pre-DIC compared with DIC negative patients (P < 0.05). Thus, these modified non-overt DIC diagnostic criteria might be useful for diagnosing early-phase DIC.

### Disseminated intravascular coagulation [^114WSSp8]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2016). Low credibility.

To provide a review of the definition, pathophysiology, differential diagnosis, and treatment of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), a case scenario and a review of the literature related to the pertinent facts concerning DIC are provided.

DIC is a systemic pathophysiologic process and not a single disease entity, resulting from an overwhelming activation of coagulation that consumes platelets and coagulation factors. This process causes microvascular fibrin thrombi, which can result in multiorgan dysfunction syndrome from tissue ischemia. Some conditions associated with acute DIC include septic shock, exsanguinating trauma, burns, or acute promyelocytic leukemia.

The massive tissue factor stimulus results in excess intravascular thrombin, which overcomes the anticoagulant systems and leads to thrombosis. Because of the consumption of coagulation factors and platelets, DIC also has a hemorrhagic phase. Treatment of the bleeding patient with DIC is supportive, involving the use of blood components.

### How I treat disseminated intravascular coagulation [^111cy5Jr]. Blood (2018). Low credibility.

Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a condition characterized by systemic activation of coagulation, potentially leading to thrombotic obstruction of small and midsize vessels, thereby contributing to organ dysfunction. At the same time, ongoing consumption of platelets and coagulation proteins results in thrombocytopenia and low concentrations of clotting factors, which may cause profuse hemorrhagic complications.

DIC is always secondary to an underlying condition, such as severe infections, solid or hematologic malignancies, trauma, or obstetric calamities. A reliable diagnosis of DIC can be made through simple scoring algorithms based on readily available routine hemostatic parameters.

The cornerstone of supportive treatment of this coagulopathy is management of the underlying condition. Additionally, administration of heparin may be useful, and restoration of physiological anticoagulants has been suggested, but has not been proven successful in improving clinically relevant outcomes so far. In patients with major bleeding or at risk for hemorrhagic complications, administration of platelet concentrates, plasma, or coagulation factor concentrates should be considered.

### Aminocaproic acid [^116Bf9dj]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Aminocaproic acid should not be used when there is evidence of an active intravascular clotting process. When there is uncertainty as to whether the cause of bleeding is primary fibrinolysis or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), this distinction must be made before administering aminocaproic acid.

- **Contraindications**: The following tests can be applied to differentiate the two conditions:
	- Platelet count is usually decreased in DIC but normal in primary fibrinolysis.
	- Protamine paracoagulation test is positive in DIC; a precipitate forms when protamine sulfate is dropped into citrated plasma. The test is negative in the presence of primary fibrinolysis.
	- The euglobulin clot lysis test is abnormal in primary fibrinolysis but normal in DIC.

Aminocaproic acid must not be used in the presence of DIC without concomitant heparin.

### Guidance for diagnosis and treatment of DIC from harmonization of the recommendations from three guidelines [^112UtUgh]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2013). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and more specifically with respect to activated protein C, the ISTH 2013 guidelines recommend that there is insufficient evidence to support the use of activated protein C in patients with DIC. It is advised to consider its use on a case-by-case basis.
