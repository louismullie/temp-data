## Question

Treatment for refractory clindamycin

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about treatment for "refractory clindamycin". Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "refractory clindamycin" actually means in clinical practice. Then, I should verify the most likely intended condition, which is clindamycin-associated C. difficile infection and how it is defined. Next, I will review first-line therapy for initial CDI and then escalate to management of refractory or recurrent disease. After that, I should consider special populations and fulminant disease, and finally synthesize a practical, stepwise algorithm with monitoring and stewardship points, making sure I cite the highest-quality guidelines and pivotal studies throughout.

> Let me first confirm the terminology, because "refractory clindamycin" is ambiguous. Wait, let me verify the context: clindamycin is a well-known precipitant of Clostridioides difficile infection, and "refractory" in this space almost always refers to CDI that fails to respond to standard therapy or recurs despite appropriate treatment, rather than clindamycin resistance in another pathogen, so the clinically coherent interpretation is refractory CDI due to clindamycin exposure, not clindamycin itself being refractory to treatment.

> I need to ensure I'm precise about definitions. Refractory CDI generally means persistent symptoms despite appropriate antibiotic therapy, whereas recurrent CDI is the return of symptoms within 8 weeks after clinical cure; both scenarios are common after clindamycin exposure because clindamycin is a high-risk antibiotic for disrupting the gut microbiota and predisposing to CDI, with risk persisting for weeks to months after exposure [^114VHrEv] [^112UWMQ1].

> Next, I should review first-line therapy for an initial CDI episode, because refractory cases are often built on top of inadequate initial management. Hold on, I should verify current guidance: contemporary guidelines prefer fidaxomicin 200 mg orally twice daily for 10 days, with vancomycin 125 mg orally four times daily for 10 days as an acceptable alternative; metronidazole monotherapy is no longer recommended as first-line due to lower cure rates and higher recurrence risk, though it may be considered only if fidaxomicin and vancomycin are unavailable [^115YTVZK] [^116chHt6] [^111oxKdy].

> Now, for refractory or recurrent CDI, I should confirm escalation strategies. Let me think about recurrence first: after a first recurrence, fidaxomicin is preferred and performs better than vancomycin for sustained response; alternatively, a tapered and pulsed vancomycin regimen can be used, and bezlotoxumab can be added in patients at high risk of recurrence to reduce recurrence further, with moderate-quality evidence supporting these choices [^116gZZ47] [^112UWMQ1] [^115wPjjJ].

> For multiple recurrences or truly refractory cases, I should double-check the role of microbiome restoration. Fecal microbiota transplantation is strongly recommended after multiple failures of appropriate antibiotics, with high-quality evidence showing approximately 80–90% cure after a single FMT and a number needed to treat around 3; this is where FMT shifts from optional to standard of care in refractory pathways [^111c6kZe] [^113M11WS] [^1176viKD].

> But wait, what if the patient is severely ill or has fulminant CDI. I need to ensure I don't under-treat fulminant disease: oral vancomycin 500 mg every 6 hours is recommended, with addition of intravenous metronidazole 500 mg every 8 hours, and early surgical consultation is essential; if the patient is deteriorating despite this, some guidelines allow case-by-case consideration of IV tigecycline as adjunctive therapy, acknowledging low-to-moderate quality evidence and the need for careful selection in critical care settings [^117F9Hxo] [^114dd6Em] [^1154jM2q] [^114NEM7e].

> I should confirm special populations and stewardship steps. In immunocompromised hosts, vancomycin or fidaxomicin remain first-line, and FMT may be less effective but still reasonable; in all cases, ongoing non–C. difficile antibiotics should be stopped when feasible, and high-risk agents like clindamycin should be avoided in the future to reduce recurrence risk, aligning with antimicrobial stewardship principles [^111hQW8k] [^112sRnFf].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm and double-check it aligns with guidelines. For an initial episode, use fidaxomicin or vancomycin for 10 days and avoid metronidazole if possible; for a first recurrence, use fidaxomicin or a tapered/pulsed vancomycin regimen and consider bezlotoxumab if high risk; for multiple recurrences or refractory disease, proceed to FMT after stopping CDI antibiotics 1–3 days prior; for fulminant disease, use high-dose oral vancomycin plus IV metronidazole with early surgical input and consider IV tigecycline only if failing standard therapy; throughout, stop offending antibiotics, correct fluids/electrolytes, and monitor closely for response and complications [^115YTVZK] [^116gZZ47] [^113gqbC5] [^117F9Hxo].

> Finally, I should verify key counseling points. Patients need to know that clindamycin is a major CDI risk factor and should be avoided unless absolutely necessary, that symptoms can begin weeks to months after exposure, and that recurrence is common but treatable with escalating strategies including FMT; this helps set expectations and supports adherence to stewardship and follow-up plans [^114VHrEv] [^116VNYpS] [^111c6kZe].

The phrase "refractory clindamycin" is not standard medical terminology. If you meant **clindamycin-resistant bacterial infections**, management should be guided by culture and susceptibility results, with **alternative agents** such as beta-lactams, macrolides, or fluoroquinolones selected based on the pathogen and local resistance patterns. If you meant **clindamycin-induced C. difficile infection (CDI)**, treat with fidaxomicin or vancomycin, add bezlotoxumab for high recurrence risk, and consider fecal microbiota transplantation for recurrent or refractory cases. Please clarify the exact clinical scenario so I can provide a more targeted plan.

---

## Interpretation of "refractory clindamycin"

The term "refractory clindamycin" is ambiguous; two common interpretations are:

- **Clindamycin-resistant bacterial infections**: Infections caused by bacteria that are resistant to clindamycin, requiring alternative antimicrobial therapy.
- **Clindamycin-induced C. difficile infection (CDI)**: CDI that occurs following clindamycin exposure, which may be refractory to standard therapy and requires specific management strategies.

---

## Management of clindamycin-resistant bacterial infections

When clindamycin resistance is identified, **management should be guided by culture and susceptibility results**, with alternative antimicrobial agents selected based on the specific pathogen and local resistance patterns:

| **Pathogen** | **Alternative antimicrobial agents** |
|-|-|
| Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) | - Vancomycin <br/> - Linezolid <br/> - Daptomycin <br/> - Tigecycline |
| Streptococcus pneumoniae | - Penicillin G <br/> - Amoxicillin <br/> - Ceftriaxone <br/> - Levofloxacin |
| Anaerobic bacteria (e.g. Bacteroides spp.) | - Metronidazole <br/> - Beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitors (e.g. piperacillin-tazobactam) <br/> - Carbapenems (e.g. meropenem) |

---

## Management of clindamycin-induced C. difficile infection (CDI)

Clindamycin is a well-known risk factor for CDI, and management should follow **evidence-based guidelines**:

- **Discontinuation of clindamycin**: Immediately stop clindamycin and any other non-essential antibiotics [^111un7B2].
- **First-line therapy**: Fidaxomicin 200 mg orally twice daily for 10 days is preferred; vancomycin 125 mg orally four times daily for 10 days is an acceptable alternative [^115YTVZK] [^116chHt6].
- **Adjunctive therapy**: Bezlotoxumab, a monoclonal antibody against toxin B, may be added in patients at high risk of recurrence (e.g. age ≥ 65, immunocompromised, severe CDI) [^115UuvKB] [^115wPjjJ].
- **Recurrent CDI**: Consider fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) after multiple recurrences or refractory cases [^113M11WS] [^1176viKD].

---

## Clinical outcomes and prognosis

Outcomes depend on the clinical context. Clindamycin-resistant infections generally have a favorable prognosis when **appropriate alternative therapy** is initiated based on susceptibility results, whereas clindamycin-induced CDI carries a higher risk of recurrence and complications, particularly in elderly or immunocompromised patients. Early recognition and appropriate management — including FMT for recurrent cases — significantly improve outcomes [^111c6kZe].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

The term "refractory clindamycin" requires clarification. If referring to clindamycin-resistant infections, **select alternative antibiotics based on susceptibility testing**; if referring to clindamycin-induced CDI, follow guideline-directed therapy with fidaxomicin or vancomycin, consider bezlotoxumab for high-risk patients, and use FMT for recurrent or refractory cases. Please specify the exact clinical scenario for a more tailored management plan.

Scope

In 2009, the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) published the first treatment guidance document for Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI). This document was updated in 2014. The growing literature on CDI antimicrobial treatment and novel treatment approaches, such as faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) and toxin-binding monoclonal antibodies, prompted the ESCMID study group on C. difficile (ESGCD) to update the 2014 treatment guidance document for CDI in adults.

Methods and Questions

Key questions on CDI treatment were formulated by the guideline committee and included: What is the best treatment for initial, severe, severe-complicated, refractory, recurrent and multiple recurrent CDI? What is the best treatment when no oral therapy is possible? Can prognostic factors identify patients at risk for severe and recurrent CDI and is there a place for CDI prophylaxis? Outcome measures for treatment strategy were: clinical cure, recurrence and sustained cure. For studies on surgical interventions and severe-complicated CDI the outcome was mortality. Appraisal of available literature and drafting of recommendations was performed by the guideline drafting group. The total body of evidence for the recommendations on CDI treatment consists of the literature described in the previous guidelines, supplemented with a systematic literature search on randomized clinical trials and observational studies from 2012 and onwards. The Grades of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system was used to grade the strength of our recommendations and the quality of the evidence. The guideline committee was invited to comment on the recommendations. The guideline draft was sent to external experts and a patients' representative for review. Full ESCMID endorsement was obtained after a public consultation procedure.

Recommendations

Important changes compared with previous guideline include but are not limited to: metronidazole is no longer recommended for treatment of CDI when fidaxomicin or vancomycin are available, fidaxomicin is the preferred agent for treatment of initial CDI and the first recurrence of CDI when available and feasible, FMT or bezlotoxumab in addition to standard of care antibiotics (SoC) are preferred for treatment of a second or further recurrence of CDI, bezlotoxumab in addition to SoC is recommended for the first recurrence of CDI when fidaxomicin was used to manage the initial CDI episode, and bezlotoxumab is considered as an ancillary treatment to vancomycin for a CDI episode with high risk of recurrence when fidaxomicin is not available. Contrary to the previous guideline, in the current guideline emphasis is placed on risk for recurrence as a factor that determines treatment strategy for the individual patient, rather than the disease severity.

CURRENT AND NEWLY APPROVED Clostridioides difficile INFECTION TREATMENTS

The vegetative bacteria can be successfully eliminated with antimicrobial therapy; however, the spores are highly resilient and can persist in the gut. The treatment of initial CDI with antimicrobial therapy can cause further disruptions to the microbiota, exacerbating the intestinal dysbiosis and potentially leading to the relapse of symptoms, known as CDI recurrence. CDI recurrence is defined as the onset of symptoms within 8 weeks of clinical cure from a previous episode and can occur in up to 20% of patients, with increasing frequency with each subsequent episode. This highlights the need to combine current antimicrobial regimes with microbiota-restorative therapies to re-establish colonization resistance of the commensal microbiota and reduce the likelihood of recurrent disease.

In line with current guidelines, CDI treatment options include fidaxomicin, vancomycin and metronidazole. Fidaxomicin is a narrow spectrum antibiotic that demonstrates superior preservation of the intestinal microbiota when compared to vancomycin and is associated with similar clinical cure rates and a lower risk of CDI recurrence. Fidaxomicin standard therapy (200 mg, 12 hourly for 10 days) is recommended as the first choice for treatment of the initial episode of nonsevere CDI, severe CDI and severe-complicated/refractory CDI. If fidaxomicin is not available, standard vancomycin therapy (125 mg, 6 hourly for 10 days) can be used as an alternative. Metronidazole is no longer recommended as a first line agent to treat CDI as the clinical cure rate demonstrated inferiority to vancomycin and was found to be a robust predictor of recurrence; however, despite recommendations, metronidazole remains a first line treatment option in many countries due to the cost and availability of alternatives.

### Treatment of refractory and recurrent Clostridium difficile infection [^114RrRBh]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2011). Medium credibility.

The incidence of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) has increased since 2000, with greater numbers of severe cases reported, in part due to the emergence of a hypervirulent strain. Initial therapy with metronidazole is still recommended for mild to moderate CDI, but vancomycin is recommended for first-line therapy of severe CDI. Colectomy could be life-saving for some patients with severe disease that does not respond to maximal medical therapy. Recurrent CDI is a challenge to treat; no single effective therapy currently exists. Treatments include antibiotics, adjunct probiotics, fecal microbiota transplant and immune approaches. This Review discusses the various therapeutic approaches used for the treatment of refractory and recurrent CDI.

### Clostridioides difficile infection in the critically ill: what kind of therapy for refractory cases [^111D75Wk]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

We read with great interest the recent paper by Manthey et al. who suggest that intravenous metronidazole monotherapy may not represent an efficient treatment for Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) and future studies should evaluate combination therapy. Although the paper covered a range of therapeutic regimens, we would like to expand on their discussion of treatment options, especially in refractory cases which occur quite often. In a recent study of severe CDI cases, the efficacy of tigecycline was compared with standard therapy (oral vancomycin plus intravenous metronidazole). Patients treated with IV tigecycline had significantly better outcomes of clinical cure (34/45, 75.6% vs. 24/45, 53.3%; p 0.02), a less complicated disease course (13/45, 28.9% vs. 24/45, 53.3%; p 0.02), and less CDI sepsis (7/45, 15.6% vs. 18/45, 40.0%; p 0.009). Rates of ileus, toxic megacolon, mortality, and relapse were similar between the two groups. Given these findings, tigecycline might be considered as a potential candidate for therapeutic use in cases of CDI refractory to standard treatment. Fidaxomicin is a macrocyclic antibiotic with a narrow spectrum of activity. It kills the vegetative form of CDI bacteria and binds to its spores, preventing them from germinating and producing toxin. It also causes less disruption of the gut microbiota compared with vancomycin. It has been recommended for cases of recurrent and refractory CDI. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a promising new therapy for the treatment of recurrent and antibiotic refractory CDI, with cure rates of over 80% in most clinical trials to date. It is based on the principle that the restoration of a healthy gut microbiota will reduce the susceptibility of a patient to CDI. Nontoxigenic C. difficile spores protect against the colonization by toxigenic strains and halt the development of CDI; a phase II trial found very low (2%) recurrence rate within 6 weeks of treatment in patients colonized with nontoxigenic C. difficile spores. Phase III trials are warranted to elucidate the role of this treatment option in preventing CDI. We see that the clinical armamentarium is far more developed than we thought.

TREATMENT AND PREVENTION OF RECURRENCE

One notable change in the ESCMID treatment guidelines from previous editions is the treatment recommendations for patients at high risk of recurrence. Reducing recurrent CDI is a key goal that can be approached from a number of angles, including: reducing the population at risk of recurrence using effective infection control procedures and antimicrobial stewardship; re-establishing colonization resistance through intestinal microbiota restoration; increasing the patients' immunity and disrupting the pathogenesis pathway.

### The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons clinical practice guidelines for the management of Clostridioides difficile infection [^1158xXUc]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2021). High credibility.

Clostridioides difficile infection — Adjunctive agents for recurrent or refractory disease are summarized as follows: Adjunctive agents including other antimicrobials, binding agents, and probiotics may be considered in addition to standard treatment in cases of recurrent or refractory CDI, with Grade of recommendation: Weak recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 2C. Rifaximin may be used to treat recurrent CDI and has a moderate success rate (53%–67%) in this setting, and because of the propensity of C difficile to develop resistance to rifaximin, this drug should typically be used in combination with other recommended agents. For refractory CDI, tigecycline can be used with dosing of 100 mg IV loading dose followed by 50 mg every 12 hours for 5–24 days, and in a pooled analysis of 47 cases of refractory CDI treated with standard antibiotics together with adjunctive tigecycline, 7 patients (15%) died and 35 (77%) were cured. Toxin-binding agents such as cholestyramine and colestipol are also used as adjuncts for recurrent CDI with variable success, and because binding agents can also bind oral vancomycin (based on in vitro studies), the administration of these medications should be staggered by a few hours; data regarding tolevamer show it is inferior to vancomycin and metronidazole for treating CDI, with unknown adjunctive efficacy. Finally, administering antimotility agents to patients with CDI has historically been discouraged, but prospective data regarding this practice is not available; probiotics may be useful in treating recurrent or refractory disease, but the efficacy under these circumstances remains unclear, and when used with appropriate medical therapy one small randomized trial reported decreased recurrence (RR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.35–0.98) whereas 3 other randomized controlled trials did not demonstrate a benefit.

### New and emerging therapies in treatment of Clostridium difficile infection [^113kvCuU]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2018). Low credibility.

Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) represents one of the most serious nosocomial infections that have grown dramatically over the past decade. Vancomycin and metronidazole are currently used as a standard therapy for CDI. Metronidazole is recommended as a first-line therapy for mild-to-moderate infections and vancomycin is mainly used for severe and/or refractory cases. However, studies have demonstrated that there are quite high CDI relapse rates with both of these medications, which represents a challenge for clinicians. Over the last decade, a number of newer and novel therapeutic options have emerged as promising alternatives to these standard CDI therapies. The following review provides the updated summaries of these newer therapeutic agents and their status in the treatment of CDI.

### The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons clinical practice guidelines for the management of Clostridioides difficile infection [^114VHrEv]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2021). High credibility.

Evaluation of suspected Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) — When CDI is suspected, a disease-specific history should be performed emphasizing risk factors, symptoms, underlying comorbidities, and signs of severe or fulminant disease. Grade of recommendation: Strong recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 1C. Symptoms typically manifest soon after starting antibiotic therapy for another disease process, but can be delayed for up to 3 months after discontinuation of antimicrobial therapy. The strongest risk factor for developing CDI is recent antibiotic use (within 3 months), and increased duration of exposure and number of antibiotics used are associated with higher risk for developing CDI, with drugs such as clindamycin, ampicillin, penicillin with beta-lactamase inhibitors, fluoroquinolones, and thirdgeneration cephalosporins more commonly associated with developing CDI.

### Making sense of differing guidelines for Clostridioides difficile infection [^114wQjNc]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

The Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) epidemic has been impacting the world for years. Understanding accurate diagnostics is imperative to allow the appropriate patients to be treated and improve outcomes. This article leverages multiple global societal guidelines to focus on the evolving diagnostic tests available summarizing best diagnostic practices including 2-step diagnostic testing. Therapeutically, guideline recommendations more recently have favored fidaxomicin and incorporated immune-based therapies and microbial restoration therapies. As treatment options and guideline recommendations change, it is imperative to understand why these recommendations have evolved and understand current best diagnostic and therapeutic practices in managing CDI.

### Clindamycin in percent dextrose (clindamycin in 5 percent dextrose) [^111TtBQK]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

BOXED WARNING

WARNING

Clostridioides difficile- associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including clindamycin in 5% dextrose injection and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile.

Because clindamycin in 5% dextrose injection therapy has been associated with severe colitis which may end fatally, it should be reserved for serious infections where less toxic antimicrobial agents are inappropriate, as described in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section. It should not be used in patients with nonbacterial infections such as most upper respiratory tract infections.

C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents.

If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.

### Advances in the medical treatment of Clostridioides difficile infection [^111r1xjw]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Clostridioides difficile medical management has changed significantly over the past decade with emphasis on preventing recurrent infection. This review compares current guidelines on the treatment of initial, recurrent, fulminant, and pediatric C difficile infection (CDI) and evaluates the mechanisms and clinical use of available antibiotics for CDI. C difficile has complex resistance mechanisms to vancomycin, fidaxomicin, and metronidazole which may play a role in treatment outcomes. Antibiotics such as tigecycline and rifaximin as well as monoclonal antibodies against toxin B may play a role in adjunctive therapy. Additional therapies under development include new narrow therapeutic antibiotics.

### Clostridioides difficile infection: update on management [^115WwQeP]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of Clostridioides difficile infection have recently been updated. Risk factors include recent exposure to health care facilities or antibiotics, especially clindamycin. C. difficile infection is characterized by a wide range of symptoms, from mild or moderate diarrhea to severe disease with pseudomembranous colitis, colonic ileus, toxic megacolon, sepsis, or death. C. difficile infection should be considered in patients who are not taking laxatives and have three or more episodes of unexplained, unformed stools in 24 hours. Testing in these patients should start with enzyme immunoassays for glutamate dehydrogenase and toxins A and B or nucleic acid amplification testing. In children older than 12 months, testing is recommended only for those with prolonged diarrhea and risk factors. Treatment depends on whether the episode is an initial vs. recurrent infection and on the severity of the infection based on white blood cell count, serum creatinine level, and other clinical signs and symptoms. For an initial episode of nonsevere C. difficile infection, oral vancomycin or oral fidaxomicin is recommended. Metronidazole is no longer recommended as first-line therapy for adults. Fecal microbiota transplantation is a reasonable treatment option with high cure rates in patients who have had multiple recurrent episodes and have received appropriate antibiotic therapy for at least three of the episodes. Good antibiotic stewardship is a key strategy to decrease rates of C. difficile infection. In routine or endemic settings, hands should be cleaned with either soap and water or an alcohol-based product, but during outbreaks soap and water is superior. The Infectious Diseases Society of America does not recommend the use of probiotics for prevention of C. difficile infection.

Authors' response

Carolin F. Manthey, Valentin Fuhrmann

We thank the authors for their critical review and valuable information. Indeed, we were only able to analyze treatment in patients with CDI on our ICU that was actually administered due to the retrospective nature of our study. As pointed out by Honoré et al. further phase III trials are warranted, since the aforementioned alternative therapy options have not been tested in prospective studies in critically ill patients. The aim of our study was the analysis of initial CDI therapy in ICU patients; here, we could observe that metronidazole intravenously administered was inferior to other therapies in these patients. Analyzing treatment in refractory cases would be another aim and is definitely worth looking at. Tigecycline, a member of the glycylcyclines, is a broad-spectrum agent with in vitro and in vivo activity against multidrug-resistant gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens. A recent meta-analysis evaluated six retrospective cohort studies, 1 prospective study, 1 case series, and 2 case reports involving tigecycline in treating severe C. difficile infection. An overall cure rate of 79% (95% CI 73.0–84.5%) could be observed for 186 patients in total. However, studies included were heterogenous since they included observations employing tigecycline in monotherapy as well as combination therapy of tigecycline and other agents, but overall tigecycline appears as a good treatment option in severe cases of CDI. We believe that the initial CDI therapy is crucial in critically ill patients and should be administered as combination therapy, although we need prospective data to support this recommendation. Until now, most studies evaluate metronidazole and vancomycin in CDI treatment. In refractory cases, treatment is challenging and warrants further trials evaluating and comparing newer drugs such as tigecycline and fidaxomicin as well as FMT.

### Intravenous tigecycline as adjunctive or alternative therapy for severe refractory Clostridium difficile infection [^1118VA31]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) has become more refractory to standard therapy. We describe 4 patients with severe refractory CDI who were successfully treated with tigecycline. Symptoms improved within 1 week. No relapses were observed. This favorable outcome suggests that tigecycline might be a useful alternative for treating severe refractory CDI.

Clostridioides difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including clindamycin injection, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile.

C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents.

If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.

Anaphylactic and Severe Hypersensitivity Reactions

Anaphylactic shock and anaphylactic reactions have been reported (see ADVERSE REACTIONS).

Severe hypersensitivity reactions, including severe skin reactions such as toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), and Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), some with fatal outcome, have been reported (see ADVERSE REACTIONS).

INTRODUCTION

As the causative agent of Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI), the bacterium C. difficile is a Gram-positive, anaerobic spore forming pathogen of the gastrointestinal tract. As a toxin-mediated disease, CDI poses a significant burden to patients and healthcare systems globally. CDI causes a wide range of symptoms, ranging from mild self-limiting diarrhoea to life-threatening complications such as pseudomembranous colitis and toxic mega-colon. Antibiotic treatment can fail to fully resolve the primary infection, resulting in the relapse of disease in up to 20% of cases. C. difficile has been listed as an urgent threat by the Centre for Disease Control (CDC, USA) with an estimated 500 000 cases per year and 12 800 deaths with $1B attributable costs in the United States. The economic impact of CDI also represents a significant burden in Europe, with costs to healthcare systems estimated at €3000M per year. Risk factors for the development of primary CDI include age ≥ 65 years, antibiotic use, with increased risk for each extra antibiotic prescribed, and prior hospital admission.

Clostridioides difficile- Associated Diarrhea

Clostridioides difficile- associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including clindamycin HCl, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon, leading to overgrowth of C. difficile.

C. difficile produces toxins A and B, which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial drug use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents.

If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibacterial drug use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial drug treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.

Anaphylactic and Severe Hypersensitivity Reactions

Anaphylactic shock and anaphylactic reactions have been reported (See ADVERSE REACTIONS).

Severe hypersensitivity reactions, including severe skin reactions such as toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), and Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), some with fatal outcome, have been reported (See ADVERSE REACTIONS).

In case of such an anaphylactic or severe hypersensitivity reaction, discontinue treatment permanently and institute appropriate therapy.

A careful inquiry should be made concerning previous sensitivities to drugs and other allergens.

Nephrotoxicity

Clindamycin is potentially nephrotoxic and cases with acute kidney injury have been reported. Consider monitoring of renal function particularly in patients with pre-existing renal dysfunction or those taking concomitant nephrotoxic drugs. In case of acute kidney injury, discontinue clindamycin HCl when no other etiology is identified.

Usage in Meningitis

Since clindamycin does not diffuse adequately into the cerebrospinal fluid, the drug should not be used in the treatment of meningitis.

###: diagnosis and treatments [^115w4AKC]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Clostridioides difficile (formerly Clostridium) is a major cause of healthcare associated diarrhea, and is increasingly present in the community. Historically, C difficile infection was considered easy to diagnose and treat. Over the past two decades, however, diagnostic techniques have changed in line with a greater understanding of the physiopathology of C difficile infection and the use of new therapeutic molecules. The evolution of diagnosis showed there was an important under- and misdiagnosis of C difficile infection, emphasizing the importance of algorithms recommended by European and North American infectious diseases societies to obtain a reliable diagnosis. Previously, metronidazole was considered the reference drug to treat C difficile infection, but more recently vancomycin and other newer drugs are shown to have higher cure rates. Recurrence of infection represents a key parameter in the evaluation of new drugs, and the challenge is to target the right population with the adapted therapeutic molecule. In multiple recurrences, fecal microbiota transplantation is recommended. New approaches, including antibodies, vaccines, and new molecules are already available or in the pipeline, but more data are needed to support the inclusion of these in practice guidelines. This review aims to provide a baseline for clinicians to understand and stratify their choice in the diagnosis and treatment of C difficile infection based on the most recent data available.

Clostridium difficile infection is an increasing burden to the health care system, totaling more than $1 billion/year in the United States. Treatment of patients with C difficile infection with metronidazole or vancomycin reduces morbidity and mortality, although the number of patients that do not respond to metronidazole is increasing. Despite initial response rates of greater than 90%, 15%-30% of patients have a relapse in symptoms after successful initial therapy, usually in the first few weeks after treatment is discontinued. Failure to develop specific antibody response has recently been identified as a critical factor in recurrence. The review discusses the different management strategies for initial and recurrent symptomatic C difficile infections.

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) — initial treatment for an initial episode: Oral vancomycin or fidaxomicin is considered first-line treatment for an initial CDI, whereas metronidazole alone is no longer considered appropriate first-line treatment; Grade of recommendation: Strong recommendation based on high-quality evidence, 1A. For nonfulminant CDI, the recommended oral vancomycin dose is 125 mg 4 times a day and the recommended fidaxomicin dose is 200 mg twice a day; a 10-day course of either medication resolves CDI diarrhea in > 90% of patients. Evidence synthesis shows vancomycin was more effective in achieving a cure (79%) than metronidazole (72%); relative risk (RR), 0.90; 95% CI, 0.84–0.97, and metronidazole was inferior to vancomycin in initial cure rate (RR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.84–0.98; P = 0.02) and sustained cure rate (RR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.82–0.96; P = 0.003). Combination therapy with both vancomycin and metronidazole is associated with a higher rate of adverse events compared with monotherapy and is not typically recommended unless patients have severe-complicated or fulminant CDI.

### Evolution of clinical guidelines for antimicrobial management ofinfection [^113bv8ST]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) has been an epidemic for many years. Our biggest challenge in treating CDI is preventing recurrence, which is seen in approximately 25% of patients with initial infection and in 40–60% of those with subsequent episodes. Given the major disease burden of this infection, appropriate data-driven treatment remains essential. Clinical treatment guidelines provide an unbiased critical analysis of the literature, integrating the quality of the available data to make recommendations. As CDI has been evolving and more research has become available, the frequency of guideline issue from various global societies has increased, as has the detail of the recommendations to fit more relevant clinical scenarios. In this review, we will discuss clinical guideline recommendations over three time periods: The Initial Guidelines 1995–1997, The Second Wave 2009–2013, and The Modern Era 2014–present. We see the changing recommendations from metronidazole or vancomycin for initial infection during earlier times to preferential treatment with fidaxomicin within the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and Society of Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA) joint guidelines provisional update in late 2020. The recommended treatments for first recurrence were initially with the same antimicrobial as the first episode but have since changed to having multiple options for one or more recurrences. We have also seen the addition of immune boosting treatments, including fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT)/microbiota restoration therapy (MRT) and bezlotoxumab in the more modern recommendations. As the guidelines are evolving with the times, it remains important to understand the differences among them so we can apply this information clinically and optimize patient outcomes.

Introduction

Clostridioides difficile infections (CDI) are considered the leading cause of infectious healthcare-related diarrhea worldwide and substantial costs have been attributed to its management –. Different medical interventions, including vaccines, probiotics, and agents neutralizing antibiotic residuals in the colon, are being developed to prevent CDI –. These interventions, however, require data from pivotal trials demonstrating clinical efficacy prior to approval by regulatory authorities. Given the relatively low incidence of CDI per individual patient in target populations, trials require large numbers of patients to demonstrate efficacy of a preventive measure. For example, a trial assessing the efficacy of probiotics for the prevention of CDI included 2981 patients, assuming a 12-week incidence of 4%. As the incidence of CDI in the placebo group was only 1.2%, the trial failed to demonstrate efficacy, and would have required a more than threefold larger sample size to reach adequate power for a 50% reduction of CDI. The assumed incidence of the primary outcome is critical for successful execution of a trial and should be assessed in depth. Furthermore, the sample size can be reduced by enrichment of the RCT population with patients at a particularly high risk of CDI. Previous attempts to specify such a population identified advanced age, comorbidities, specific high-risk antibiotics (clindamycin, cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, co-amoxiclav, carbapenems, and trimethoprim/sulfonamides), and previous colonization with C. difficile as potentially important predictive factors –. More recent findings suggest that the composition of the gut microbiota and their associated metabolites play an important role in the pathogenesis of CDI. Therefore, further assessment of these potential biomarkers is warranted.

Here, we demonstrate that the 90-day incidence of CDI and antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) in patients ≥ 50 years of age treated with predefined broad-spectrum antibiotic classes is 1.9% (95% CI: 1.1–3.0) and 14.1% (95% CI: 12.0–16.4), and that carbapenem treatment, toxigenic C. difficile carriage, and the composition and diversity of the gut microbiota predict CDI but not AAD.

Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) for severe and fulminant Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is indicated and operationalized as follows: We suggest FMT be considered for patients with severe and fulminant CDI refractory to antibiotic therapy; in particular, when patients are deemed poor surgical candidates (strong recommendation, low quality of evidence). Reported single-FMT cure in case reports ranges from 66%–91%. A pseudomembrane-driven protocol treats patients who fail to respond to 5 days of vancomycin ± intravenous metronidazole with colonoscopic FMT, restarts oral vancomycin within 24–48 hours, and repeats FMT at 3- to 5-day intervals until resolution. Using this protocol, 100% of severe CDI and 87% of fulminant CDI patients were cured during the same admission. In an open-label randomized trial, overall success was 75% with a single FMT–vancomycin and 100% with multiple FMT–vancomycin (P = 0.01), with 57% fulminant cases in the multiple-FMT group. Mortality improvements accompanying FMT include reductions from 43.2% to 12.1% and, with early FMT within 2–4 days of diagnosis, from 42.2% to 12.1% (P < 0.001). During sequential therapy, administration of oral vancomycin 125 mg every 6 hours or fidaxomicin 200 mg every 12 hours should be continued as long as pseudomembrane is present, and if discharged before resolution, therapy should be continued for a minimum of 5 days followed by a final outpatient FMT.

### The changing epidemiology of Clostridium difficile infection [^115kvn98]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is a growing concern and has a substantial impact on morbidity and mortality. Epidemiology of CDI has dramatically changed over the last decade. Diagnostic and treatment strategies are even more complicated given the wide variety of available diagnostic methods and the emergence of refractory or recurrent CDI. This review is intended to provide information on current CDI epidemiology and guidance for evidence-based diagnosis and management strategies.

Recent Findings

Various studies from the United States, Europe, and Canada revealed increased incidence of CDI since 2000. Although CDI has long been associated with healthcare settings, recent studies indicate it is more common in the community than previously recognized. For diagnostic strategies, newer testing methods, including nucleic acid amplification tests, have enhanced sensitivity compared with toxin testing, but at the expense of decreased specificity. New agents for treating CDI are being developed and higher quality data to support fecal microbiota transplantation for treating recurrent CDI are emerging.

Summary

CDI epidemiology continues to evolve. Prompt recognition and an evidence-based treatment approach is the key to successfully manage CDI. Further, studies on diagnostic and therapeutic strategies are needed to further improve patient outcomes.

### Evolution of clinical guidelines for antimicrobial management ofinfection [^115xdFfF]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Evolution of Guideline-Based Antimicrobial Recommendations to Treat C. difficile Infection. Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is the most common healthcare-associated infection in the United States (US), imposing a major burden on our healthcare system and affecting approximately 365,000 people annually. The financial burden of managing this infection is significant as well. It is estimated that all-cause direct medical costs for a population aged 18–64 were approximately US$72,000 for those with no recurrence and approximately US$200,000 for those with three or more recurrences. Given these considerations, optimizing therapies with data-driven recommendations by experts in the field can be most beneficial to minimize the burden of this disease on our patients, lessen the frequency of recurrence, and improve overall outcomes. Clinical guideline recommendations are an essential tool guiding treatment as they summarize data for a disease and provide algorithms to manage patients based on data that has been critically validated.

The CDI epidemic essentially began in the mid-1990s and continues to this day. As this epidemic has extended, there have been more reports and studies considering this infection. When searching " C. difficile " in PubMed, there were 68 references in 1995. In 2020, there were 726. With this influx of new studies, there have been surprisingly few well-performed prospective randomized controlled trials comparing treatments head-to-head. As a result, we rely on smaller studies or non-standard designs to guide our treatments for CDI and recurrent disease. This reliance on imperfect studies has led to certain foundational treatments becoming standard without the supporting data that we would typically expect from a clinical guideline that impacts care as significantly as guidelines for the management of CDI. Given these limitations, it is important to understand how the guidelines have changed over time, and, most importantly, what foundational studies have paved the way for the most recent recommendations in order for clinicians to make decisions that are most appropriate for their patients with the best insights to the data that support those decisions.

### Clindamycin palmitate hydrochloride (Cleocin) [^112NUgrK]. FDA (2009). Low credibility.

WARNINGS

See WARNING box.

Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including CLEOCIN PEDIATRIC (Clindamycin Palmitate HCL)), and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile.

C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents.

If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.

A careful inquiry should be made concerning previous sensitivities to drugs and other allergens.

Usage in Meningitis: Since clindamycin does not diffuse adequately into the cerebrospinal fluid, the drug should not be used in the treatment of meningitis.

### Clostridium difficile: controversies and approaches to management [^113ik1Sk]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The increasing incidence of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is confronting us with two major problems in CDI management that presently remain unsolved: refractoriness to therapy and recurrence of disease. This review focuses on recent insights in antimicrobial therapy of CDI, as well as advances in alternative treatment modalities.

Recent Findings

In severe CDI, oral vancomycin has shown its superiority over metronidazole in two independent trials. Of new antimicrobials, nitazoxanide and fidaxomicin have shown promise, but the role of these and several other drugs such as rifaximin and tigecycline still has to be established. Additional antimicrobials display in-vitro activity against C. difficile but have not yet been studied in CDI patients. Immunotherapy currently focuses on intravenously administered antibodies directed against clostridial toxins, which may help reduce recurrence rates when given as adjunct to standard treatment. No new trials of probiotics in CDI have been published but current literature does not support their usage. The results of a first randomized trial of faecotherapy are awaited.

Summary

Currently, no evidence-based guidance can be given with respect to refractoriness to treatment and preventing recurrences after treatment for CDI. Results of clinical trials on new approaches with antimicrobials, immunotherapy or faecotherapy are urgently awaited.

### Antibiotic use and the risk of hospital-onset Clostridioides difficile infection [^116VNYpS]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Clostridioides difficile is a leading cause of health care–associated infections. Patients with C difficile infection (CDI) endure considerable morbidity and mortality, while health care facilities face substantial costs related to treatment and infection control efforts. Despite various preventive strategies, the incidence of CDI remains high, necessitating further exploration of risk factors and targeted interventions.

C difficile infection occurs primarily in individuals with disrupted gut microbiota, and antibiotic exposure is a well-recognized risk factor. Broad-spectrum antibiotics, such as fluoroquinolones, clindamycin, and broad-spectrum cephalosporins, substantially increase CDI risk by altering the gut microbiome and creating conditions favorable for C difficile colonization and proliferation. Moreover, the risk of CDI is influenced by the duration and intensity of antibiotic exposure, with prolonged and multiple courses of antibiotics considered particularly hazardous. Other risk factors include advanced age, comorbidities, proton pump inhibitor use, and prior CDI events.

In addition to these general risk factors, asymptomatic carriers of C difficile, ie, individuals with positive test results for the bacterium without exhibiting symptoms, present unique challenges in health care settings. These carriers not only act as potential reservoirs for transmission but also are at an elevated risk of progressing to clinical CDI. However, the specific interactions among antibiotic use, type, and duration of treatment in this high-risk group remain poorly understood. The aim of our study was to address these knowledge gaps by quantifying the rate of hospital-onset CDI among carriers of C difficile compared with noncarriers and by evaluating the role of antibiotic exposure in shaping this risk.

Initial episode — conclusion and research needs: The panel suggests the use of fidaxomicin as the preferred therapy for an initial CDI episode to improve sustained response after therapy but recognizes that vancomycin remains an acceptable alternative if fidaxomicin is not available, and calls for additional independent cost-effectiveness studies because cost is a substantial barrier, comparative trials of extended-pulsed fidaxomicin versus standard fidaxomicin and extended-dosing vancomycin, and study of the efficacy of fidaxomicin for fulminant CDI.

IDSA/SHEA 2021 Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) guideline — fulminant disease: The guideline states that the previous iteration "recommends vancomycin (500 mg 4 times daily orally or by nasogastric tube) rather than fidaxomicin for treatment of fulminant (previously known as severe, complicated) CDI", and "This recommendation remains unchanged". It further notes that trials "generally excluded patients with fulminant disease", and therefore "there are no available data supporting the use of fidaxomicin for treatment of fulminant CDI".

### Clostridioides difficile infections; new treatments and future perspectives [^115DzA9v]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

INTESTINAL MICROBIOTA RESTORATION

The microbiota plays a significant role in protecting the host from pathogen invasion through colonization resistance. The loss of colonization resistance, typically with antibiotic use, can create an environment susceptible to CDI. The use of antibiotics to treat CDI further exacerbates intestinal dysbiosis, leading to higher recurrence risk after each subsequent episode of recurrence. The microbiota of patients with recurrent CDI is characterized by reduced community diversity and altered metabolomes, with delayed and incomplete recoveries when compared to nonrecurring patients. The restoration of the gut microbiome to a healthy state is essential for the prevention of recurrent CDI. This has led to the shift in treatment approaches with antibiotics used to target C. difficile directly followed by microbiota restoration therapy to replenish the microbiota and re-establish a metabolomic state consistent with a healthy gut (Fig. 1).

IDSA/SHEA 2021 focused update — rationale for fidaxomicin vs vancomycin states that the panel agrees the balance of benefits and harms favors using fidaxomicin over vancomycin for an initial episode of CDI, with moderate certainty of evidence; the panel also judges the use of fidaxomicin is likely cost-effective, acceptable to patients and providers, and feasible to implement when considering dosing and duration, and notes that achieving both initial and sustained clinical responses are key goals and that lower recurrence rates with fidaxomicin compared with vancomycin are an important advantage.

### Current approaches to treat and prevent recurrence of Clostridioides difficile [^112HHAyD]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) and recurrent CDI (rCDI) are significant causes of morbidity and mortality. The microbiome plays a significant role in the body's defense against CDI and rCDI. Antibiotics can cause significant injury to the microbiome which leads to an increased risk of CDI and rCDI. Ongoing perturbations of the microbiome perpetuate this risk. Antibiotic treatments for CDI can kill C difficile but also can impact the microbiome. Microbiome therapeutics are effective in restoring the function of the gut microbiota and re-establishing colonization resistance. The field of microbiome therapeutics is evolving with newer, more refined, modalities in development.

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) — in a pooled analysis of 2 randomized controlled trials (RCTs), adding bezlotoxumab to standard-of-care (SOC) antibiotics reduced CDI recurrence after initial clinical cure at 12 weeks (RR: 62; 95% CI: .51–.75) and reduced CDI-associated hospital readmission at 30 days (RR: 46; 95% CI: .29–.71), but failed to show a reduction in mortality (RR: 94; 95% CI: .66–1.34), with certainty ratings as reported; the certainty in the evidence for benefits was initially rated as moderate mainly due to indirectness when fidaxomicin is the SOC antibiotic. The 2 phase III trials enrolled patients between November 2011 and May 2015, during which the 2010 IDSA-SHEA guideline suggested metronidazole for mild–moderate CDI and oral vancomycin for more severe disease, and most trial patients received metronidazole (47%) or oral vancomycin (48%); SOC antibiotics now include vancomycin and fidaxomicin in the updated 2017 IDSA-SHEA guideline. Despite planned subanalyses indicating the choice of SOC antibiotics did not influence clinical outcomes, uncertainty remains about generalizability when fidaxomicin is the SOC antibiotic because it was used in < 5% of the cohort (n = 60 patients); one study reanalyzed the modified intent-to-treat population (n = 1554).

Recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection (rCDI) first recurrence — treatment recommendations and comparative efficacy are as follows: We suggest tapering/pulsed-dose vancomycin for patients experiencing a first recurrence after an initial course of fidaxomicin, vancomycin, or metronidazole (strong recommendation, low quality of evidence). We recommend fidaxomicin for patients experiencing a first recurrence after an initial course of vancomycin or metronidazole (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). rCDI is generally defined as the recurrence of diarrhea and a confirmatory positive test (NAAT or EIA) within 8 weeks after treatment of an initial episode of CDI. In subgroup analyses of two phase 3 trials, fidaxomicin was superior in preventing a second recurrence within 28 days (35.5% of patients treated with vancomycin and 19.7% of patients treated with fidaxomicin, P = 0.045). In older adults, extended‑pulsed fidaxomicin achieved sustained clinical cure 30 days post‑treatment in 124 (70%) of 177 vs 106 (59%) of 179 with vancomycin (P = 0.030). Vancomycin cleared C. difficile by end of therapy more often than metronidazole (89% vs 59%, respectively; P = 0.001). Based on efficacy and safety concerns, metronidazole should not be used to treat rCDI and metronidazole treatment should be limited to 1 course because of risk of neurotoxicity with prolonged or repeated use.

Clostridioides difficile- Associated Diarrhea

Clostridioides difficile -associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including CLEOCIN PEDIATRIC (Clindamycin Palmitate HCl), and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile.

C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial drug use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents.

If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibacterial drug use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial drug treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.

Anaphylactic and Severe Hypersensitivity Reactions

Anaphylactic shock and anaphylactic reactions have been reported (see ADVERSE REACTIONS).

Severe hypersensitivity reactions, including severe skin reactions such as toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), and Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), some with fatal outcome, have been reported (see ADVERSE REACTIONS).

In case of such an anaphylactic or severe hypersensitivity reaction, discontinue treatment permanently and institute appropriate therapy.

A careful inquiry should be made concerning previous sensitivities to drugs and other allergens.

Nephrotoxicity

Clindamycin is potentially nephrotoxic and cases with acute kidney injury have been reported. Consider monitoring of renal function particularly in patients with pre-existing renal dysfunction or those taking concomitant nephrotoxic drugs. In case of acute kidney injury, discontinue CLEOCIN PEDIATRIC when no other etiology is identified.

Usage in Meningitis: Since clindamycin does not diffuse adequately into the cerebrospinal fluid, the drug should not be used in the treatment of meningitis.

### The effect of antibiotic therapy for Clostridioides difficile infection on mortality and other patient-relevant outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111AaDp8]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Current practice guidelines favour fidaxomicin over vancomycin and exclude metronidazole from the recommended standard regimen for Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI), based on lower recurrence rates with fidaxomicin, giving little weight to mortality or the clinical implications of recurrences.

Objectives

To compile the effects of metronidazole, glycopeptides (vancomycin or teicoplanin), and fidaxomicin for CDI on mortality and other patient-relevant outcomes.

Data Sources

PubMed, the Cochrane Library, ClinicalTrials.gov, conference proceedings, and Google Scholar, until August 2023.

Study Eligibility Criteria

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

Participants

Adult patients experiencing primary or recurrent CDI.

Interventions

Glycopeptides versus fidaxomicin or metronidazole (comparators).

Assessment Of Risk Of Bias

We used the Risk of Bias 2 (RoB 2) tool for randomized trials, focusing on the outcome of all-cause mortality.

Methods Of Data Synthesis

Random effects meta-analyses were performed for dichotomous outcomes. Outcomes were summarized preferentially for all randomly assigned patients.

Results

Thirteen trials were included. There was no significant difference in all-cause mortality (risk ratio [RR] < 1 favouring the comparator) between vancomycin and fidaxomicin (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.64–1.14, 8 RCTs, 1951 patients) or metronidazole (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.46–1.32, 4 RCTs, 808 patients), with low and very low certainty of evidence, respectively. No significant difference in initial treatment failure between fidaxomicin and vancomycin was found, however, initial treatment failure was higher with metronidazole (RR 1.58, 95% CI 1.10–2.27, 5 RCTs, 843 patients). No study reported on symptomatic recurrence necessitating re-treatment among all randomly assigned patients. Among initially cured patients, symptomatic recurrence necessitating re-treatment was lower with fidaxomicin than with vancomycin (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.42–0.71, 6 RCTs, 1617 patients). None of the studies reported on other CDI complications or the burden of infection on daily activities.

Conclusions

Setting patient-relevant outcomes for CDI independently of the RCT definitions and results might lead to less confidence in the guidance for CDI management.

Rationale for recommendation — The panel states that the balance of benefits and harms "favors adding bezlotoxumab to SOC antibiotics for patients with a CDI episode and at least 1 risk factor for recurrence (recurrent CDI episode within the last 6 months, age ≥ 65 years, immunocompromised host, and severe CDI on presentation)", and notes it "seems more favorable in patients with multiple risk factors for recurrent CDI and especially in patients with a prior CDI in the last 6 months". The certainty of evidence is described as "moderate overall, but very low in subpopulations at high risk of CDI recurrence".

Candidate selection for fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) notes that "Potential candidates for FMT include patients with multiple recurrences of CDI who have failed to resolve their infection despite treatment attempts with antibiotic agents targeting CDI", and "the opinion of the panel is that appropriate antibiotic treatments for at least 2 recurrences (ie, 3 CDI episodes) should be tried". There are "limited data on FMT administration in patients with severe, refractory CDI", and in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) FMT "appears to be less effective" with "flares of underlying disease activity" reported after FMT for recurrent CDI in IBD.

### Incidence and predictive biomarkers of Clostridioides difficile infection in hospitalized patients receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics [^112N1ivd]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Trial enrichment using gut microbiota derived biomarkers by high-risk individuals can improve the feasibility of randomized controlled trials for prevention of Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI). Here, we report in a prospective observational cohort study the incidence of CDI and assess potential clinical characteristics and biomarkers to predict CDI in 1,007 patients ≥ 50 years receiving newly initiated antibiotic treatment with penicillins plus a beta-lactamase inhibitor, 3 rd /4 th generation cephalosporins, carbapenems, fluoroquinolones or clindamycin from 34 European hospitals. The estimated 90-day cumulative incidences of a first CDI episode is 1.9% (95% CI 1.1–3.0). Carbapenem treatment (Hazard Ratio (95% CI): 5.3 (1.7–16.6)), toxigenic C. difficile rectal carriage (10.3 (3.2–33.1)), high intestinal abundance of Enterococcus spp. relative to Ruminococcus spp. (5.4 (2.1–18.7)), and low Shannon alpha diversity index as determined by 16S rRNA gene profiling (9.7 (3.2–29.7)), but not normalized urinary 3-indoxyl sulfate levels, predicts an increased CDI risk.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on fecal microbiota-based therapies for select gastrointestinal diseases [^113gqbC5]. Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) in immunocompetent adults — The AGA suggests the use of fecal microbiota–based therapies upon completion of standard of care antibiotics over no fecal microbiota–based therapies (conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence), with implementation considerations specific to outpatient, nonsevere, nonfulminant recurrent CDI. Diagnosis requires acute-onset, clinically significant, new-onset diarrhea (eg, 3 or more unformed stools in 24 hours) with appropriate testing, and recurrent CDI is typically defined by a confirmatory positive test within 8 weeks after completing CDI antibiotics. Fecal microbiota–based options include conventional fecal microbiota transplant (FMT), fecal microbiota live-jslm, and fecal microbiota spores live-brpk; prevention can be considered after the second recurrence (third episode) or in select high-risk patients, including those who have recovered from severe, fulminant, or treatment-refractory CDI or who have significant comorbidities, and careful consideration is recommended when frequent or long-term antibiotics are required. For conventional FMT administration, antibiotics for CDI should be stopped 1–3 days beforehand; if a bowel purge is used FMT can be given 1 day after stopping, otherwise allow 3 days off antibiotics, and note that some patients recur within 1–2 days of stopping CDI antibiotics. Conventional FMT should use appropriately screened donor stool, may be delivered via multiple routes with insufficient evidence to recommend a specific route, and reasonable alternatives for those not pursuing fecal microbiota–based therapies include a vancomycin taper, tapered-pulsed fidaxomicin, or bezlotoxumab.

Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

IDSA/SHEA 2021 Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) — initial CDI episode treatment lists Preferred: Fidaxomicin 200 mg given twice daily for 10 days; Alternative: Vancomycin 125 mg given 4 times daily by mouth for 10 days; and for nonsevere CDI if above agents are unavailable: Metronidazole, 500 mg 3 times daily by mouth for 10–14 days, with comments that implementation depends upon available resources, vancomycin remains an acceptable alternative, and that the definition of nonsevere CDI is supported by white blood cell count of 15 000 cells/μL or lower and a serum creatinine level < 1.5 mg/dL.
