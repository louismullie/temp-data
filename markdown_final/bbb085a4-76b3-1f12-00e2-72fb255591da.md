## Question

How to manage patellar bursitis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to manage patellar bursitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about distinguishing patellar bursitis from patellar tendinopathy and other anterior knee pain sources. Then, I should verify how to assess for septic versus aseptic bursitis. Next, I will outline first-line conservative management for non-septic cases, followed by indications and techniques for aspiration and corticosteroid injection. After that, I need to check the approach to septic bursitis, including diagnostics and antibiotics. Finally, I will consider surgical options for refractory cases and summarize a practical algorithm with timelines and follow-up checkpoints.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entities and avoid a common pitfall: patellar bursitis is inflammation of a bursa around the patella, most often prepatellar or infrapatellar, and should be differentiated from patellar tendinopathy, which is a load-related degenerative tendon disorder. Confusing these leads to mismanagement, so I need to ensure the diagnosis is bursitis rather than tendinopathy before proceeding [^643db491] [^920733ff].

> I will now examine the key bedside discriminators. Prepatellar bursitis typically presents with a localized, egg-shaped swelling superficial to the patella and point tenderness over the bursa, whereas patellar tendinopathy produces pain at the inferior pole of the patella that is load-related and worsens with energy-storage activities. Careful palpation and history help separate bursal from tendinous pain generators and guide whether to aspirate or load the tendon, respectively [^643db491] [^ec32dfc4].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about etiology. I need to check for septic bursitis whenever there is erythema, warmth, fever, or systemic symptoms, because missing sepsis delays definitive care and increases morbidity. If septic bursitis is suspected, I should aspirate for Gram stain, cell count, and culture before initiating antibiotics to preserve diagnostic yield [^643db491] [^bb366f65].

> Next, I should review first-line conservative management for non-septic patellar bursitis. Ice, NSAIDs, and activity modification with avoidance of kneeling or direct pressure are foundational. Protective padding can reduce friction and facilitate healing. I should confirm that symptoms are improving within 1–2 weeks and adjust load accordingly to prevent chronicity [^643db491] [^8933b734].

> Wait, let me verify the role of corticosteroid injection. For persistent, non-septic bursitis after a trial of conservative care, ultrasound-guided intrabursal corticosteroid injection can provide acute pain relief and reduce inflammation. I should ensure the injection is truly intrabursal and not into the tendon, and I should counsel on the risk of flare or skin changes. Evidence is stronger for ultrasound guidance improving accuracy in peri-tendinous injections, and while much of the knee guidance literature focuses on pes anserine bursitis, the principle of image guidance improving localization applies to other superficial bursae as well [^643db491] [^d4c85c15].

> I need to ensure I do not inadvertently inject the patellar tendon. The ACR advises against peritendinous corticosteroid injections at the patellar tendon due to risk of tendon rupture, so I should confirm the needle is in the bursa and avoid injecting into the tendon substance or at the enthesis, especially in athletes with load demands [^c2d67f78] [^dec88d52].

> If septic bursitis is suspected or confirmed, I should double-check the diagnostic steps. I will aspirate the bursa for Gram stain, cell count, and culture, obtain blood work for leukocytosis, and start empiric antibiotics covering Staphylococcus aureus, adjusting to culture results. Oral therapy is often sufficient in uncomplicated cases, but I should escalate to IV therapy if systemic illness or immunocompromise is present and reassess clinically at 48–72 hours [^643db491] [^bb366f65].

> Let me consider surgical options for refractory cases. If nonoperative measures fail and symptoms persist beyond roughly 3–6 months, bursectomy can be considered, with open or endoscopic techniques selected based on surgeon expertise and bursal location. I should confirm that conservative therapy has been optimized and that the diagnosis is secure before proceeding to surgery [^643db491] [^8933b734].

> But wait, what if the anterior knee pain is actually patellar tendinopathy rather than bursitis. I should double-check the tender point and symptom pattern; if the pain is at the inferior patellar pole and load-dependent, I should pivot to a tendon-loading rehabilitation protocol rather than bursal-directed treatments, because exercise therapy is first-line for patellar tendinopathy and corticosteroid injection into the tendon is discouraged [^e541cef8] [^c2d67f78].

> I will now synthesize a practical algorithm with checkpoints. First, confirm the diagnosis clinically and exclude septic features. Second, initiate ice, NSAIDs, activity modification, and padding for 1–2 weeks. Third, if no improvement, consider ultrasound-guided intrabursal corticosteroid injection after confirming non-septic status. Fourth, if still refractory after 3–6 months, discuss bursectomy with shared decision-making. Throughout, reassess at 2, 6, and 12 weeks to ensure trajectory and avoid chronicity [^643db491] [^8933b734].

> Finally, I should confirm follow-up and safety netting. I will advise patients to return urgently if redness, warmth, fever, or dramatically increased pain develop, as this could herald septic bursitis. I will also set expectations that most non-septic cases resolve with conservative care, but a subset require injection or surgery, and that image guidance improves accuracy when intervening [^643db491] [^d4c85c15].

Patellar bursitis is best managed with **conservative care first** [^643db491] — rest, ice, NSAIDs, and activity modification — with most patients improving within 2–4 weeks. If pain persists, **ultrasound-guided corticosteroid injection** can provide rapid relief [^notfound], but avoid repeated injections due to tendon risk [^c2d67f78]. Septic bursitis requires **urgent aspiration and antibiotics** [^643db491]; surgery is reserved for refractory or recurrent cases. Return to activity is gradual once swelling and pain resolve, with protective padding to prevent recurrence [^643db491].

---

## Clinical presentation and diagnosis

Patellar bursitis presents with **anterior knee pain**, localized swelling, and tenderness over the affected bursa (prepatellar or infrapatellar) [^643db491]. The diagnosis is primarily clinical, supported by ultrasound to confirm bursal fluid and exclude other causes [^643db491]. Septic bursitis may show erythema, warmth, and systemic symptoms; aspiration with Gram stain and culture is essential when infection is suspected [^643db491].

---

## Conservative management

Conservative management is **first-line** and effective for most cases:

- **Rest and activity modification**: Avoid kneeling, squatting, and aggravating activities [^643db491].

- **Ice therapy**: Apply ice for 15–20 minutes every 2–3 hours during acute inflammation.

- **Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)**: Ibuprofen or naproxen reduce pain and inflammation [^643db491].

- **Protective padding**: Knee pads prevent recurrent trauma during work or sports [^643db491].

- **Physical therapy**: Focus on quadriceps strengthening, flexibility, and biomechanical correction [^notfound].

Most patients improve within 2–4 weeks with these measures [^notfound].

---

## Pharmacologic interventions

### Corticosteroid injections

Intrabursal corticosteroid injections are indicated for persistent, non-septic bursitis after 2–4 weeks of conservative care [^notfound]. Ultrasound guidance improves accuracy and reduces complications [^d4c85c15]. Relief is often rapid, but **limit repeat injections** to avoid tendon degeneration or rupture [^c2d67f78].

---

### Antibiotics

Antibiotics are indicated only for **septic bursitis**, guided by aspiration and culture results [^643db491]. Empiric therapy should cover Staphylococcus aureus (e.g. cephalexin or clindamycin), with adjustments based on culture and sensitivity [^notfound].

---

## Surgical management

Surgery is reserved for **refractory cases** or complications:

- **Indications**: Chronic, recurrent, or septic bursitis unresponsive to conservative care [^643db491].

- **Procedures**: Open or arthroscopic bursectomy removes the inflamed bursa [^643db491].

- **Outcomes**: Generally favorable, with low recurrence when combined with activity modification and protective padding [^notfound].

---

## Rehabilitation and return to activity

Rehabilitation emphasizes **gradual, progressive loading** and biomechanical correction. Return to activity is allowed once swelling and pain resolve, typically 2–4 weeks after conservative care or 4–6 weeks after injection or surgery. Protective padding and ergonomic adjustments help prevent recurrence [^643db491].

---

## Prevention strategies

Prevention focuses on **risk-factor modification**:

- **Protective equipment**: Knee pads for occupations or sports with frequent kneeling [^643db491].

- **Ergonomic adjustments**: Use cushioned surfaces or knee-friendly tools [^notfound].

- **Strength and flexibility**: Regular quadriceps and hip strengthening, plus flexibility training [^notfound].

## Summary of treatment algorithm

| **Step** | **Intervention** | **Indication** |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | Rest, ice, NSAIDs, activity modification | All patients |
| 2 | Physical therapy | Persistent symptoms |
| 3 | Ultrasound-guided corticosteroid injection | Refractory non-septic cases |
| 4 | Aspiration and antibiotics | Septic bursitis |
| 5 | Surgical bursectomy | Refractory or recurrent cases |

---

Patellar bursitis is managed with **conservative care first**, escalating to injection or surgery only if needed. Most patients recover fully, and recurrence is minimized with protective measures and activity modification [^643db491].

Methods

The present systematic review has been conducted and authored according to the 'Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses–NMAs' (PRISMA-NMA) guidelines.

Our population, intervention, comparator and outcomes (PICO) were defined as follows:

P: patients with patellar tendinopathy.

I: any treatment modality for patellar tendinopathy.

C: any other treatment modality, placebo or no treatment.

O: Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) or equivalent for pain (primary outcome) and Victorian Institute of Sports Assessment-Patellar (VISA-P; secondary outcome).

Eligibility

Included studies had a randomised design of any type and compared treatment modalities for patellar tendinopathy with other treatment modalities, placebo or no treatment. Additionally, at least one of our preset outcome measures had to be included in the study. Participants had to be over 18 years of age with a clinical diagnosis of patellar tendinopathy of any duration and severity with or without radiological confirmation. Duration of the condition was not a criterion and neither were previous treatments and follow-up. Inclusion of special populations (eg, athletes) was not an exclusion criterion and was not considered in analyses, provided that their proportion in the treatment groups was comparable.

Non-randomised comparative studies, observational studies, case reports, case series, literature reviews, published conference abstracts and studies published in languages other than English were excluded.

Panel selection and scoping questions

In 2019, as part of the preparatory phase of the guideline process, an expert panel was commissioned by the Netherlands Association of Sports Medicine to update and expand the existing 2010 guideline. The panel consisted of representatives from all relevant healthcare disciplines (general practice, occupational medicine, sports medicine, orthopaedic surgery, radiology, podiatry and physical therapy) involved in treating patients with anterior knee pain. The panel received methodological support from the Knowledge Institute of the Dutch Association of Medical Specialists. More information about the selection of the expert panel and declaration of interest is provided in the online Supporting Information. Additionally, a written invitational conference was organized and the involved medical associations were invited to suggest clinical questions for the optimal care of patients with anterior knee pain. The patient's perspective was clarified through a survey of patients with PFP and PT for inclusion in the recommendations. In cooperation with the panel, the Dutch Patient Federation (Nederlandse Patienten Federatie [NPF]) developed an online survey assessing patient characteristics, pros and cons, and levels of satisfaction with treatment options in primary and secondary care. Data were collected from patients with PFP and PT, between January and April 2020. Based on the results of this preparatory phase, eight major clinical questions were prioritized. These clinical questions addressed uncertainties related to diagnosing PT, the value of exercise therapy including additional conservative treatments, the role of pain medications and indications for open surgery regarding PFP and PT. Each clinical question was developed within distinct guideline Modules and Scoping Questions (Figure 1). After presenting the scoping question, each module contains relevant background, results of the evidence review, rationale and, finally, the recommendations.

Modules and Scoping Questions. Overview of the eight distinct guideline Modules and Scoping Questions for PFP and PT. PFP, patellofemoral pain; PT, patellar tendinopathy.

Other conditions that can result in anterior knee pain, such as specific intraarticular pathologies (chondral defects, patellofemoral osteoarthritis [OA]), patellar instability or recurrent patellar dislocation, fractures, tendinopathies other than PT, apophysitis, bursitis or referred pain from the hip, were not covered.

### A systematic review of surgical treatment for refractory patellar tendinopathy [^e5b17aa8]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Management Options

A number of treatment options for PT have been evaluated and prior classification systems such as that developed by Blazina have been used to guide treatment decisions. However, there is no clear consensus as to which strategy is most effective. With the development of new classification systems such as the Popkin-Golman score, surgeons may be better able to identify the ideal treatment approach. Nonsurgical treatment ranges from physical therapy with eccentric quadriceps exercises to injections with corticosteroids or sclerosing agents, extracorporeal shock wave therapy, and platelet-rich plasma injections. -

For cases refractory to nonsurgical management, open versus arthroscopic surgical techniques have been described. These include débridement of pathologic tissue, bone or tendon resection at the inferior patellar pole, denervation of the infrapatellar pole, primary suture or suture anchor repair, and augmentation of the patellar tendon with suture, wire, allograft, or autograft.Débridement techniques attempt to remove degenerative tissue and stimulate healing of the inferior patellar pole and patellar tendon. Repair and augmentation techniques attempt to reapproximate the patellar tendon and increase its tensile strength.

Prior studies have identified promising outcomes with surgical intervention in the appropriate patient cohorts, and with the advent of new classification systems and treatment modalities, as well as standardized outcome reporting such as VISA-P and visual analog scale (VAS) for pain scores, it is increasingly important to continue analyzing optimal treatment options for patients across all levels of PT severity. The purpose of this systematic review is to compile and analyze all studies investigating surgical intervention for recalcitrant PT with standardized outcome measures to lay the groundwork for future analyses of surgical PT treatment modalities.

Bursitis

Background: A bursa is a sac filled with synovial fluid that acts as a friction cushion between structures. There are 10 bursa within and around the knee, and the 4 major bursa are the prepatellar, suprapatellar, infrapatellar, and pes anserine bursa. When friction or trauma irritates a bursa, it can become inflamed and be a significant source of knee pain. Bursitis is clinically recognized by localized pain, point tenderness, and edema at the sight of the bursa. Septic bursitis may also present with erythema, warmth, and systemic symptoms such as fevers and leukocytosis.
Etiology: Superficial to the patella is the subcutaneous prepatellar bursa, which can become inflamed with kneeling activities, and is colloquially called "housemaid's knee or carpenter's knee". Inferior to the patella are two bursae, subcutaneous infrapatellar bursa which lies superficial to the patellar ligament, and the deep (subtendinous) infrapatellar bursa which lies deep to the patellar ligament. Inferomedial knee pain may be caused by anserine bursitis. The anserine bursa lies deep to the pes anserinus comprising the tendinous attachments of the semitendinosus, gracilis, and sartorius. Proximal to the anserine bursa and deep to the semimembranosus tendon is the semimembranosus bursa. There are three lateral bursae: the bursa deep to the iliotibial tract, bursa deep to the lateral collateral ligament, and the inferior subtendinous bursa deep to the biceps femoris tendon. Posteriorly, there are two subtendinous bursa, one deep to the medial and lateral heads of the gastrocnemius. A bursa can become inflamed by overuse leading to increased friction across the bursa. Septic bursitis requires bacteria to enter the bursa and is associated with trauma.
Diagnostic criteria: Physical exam is significant for pain and point tenderness overlying the affected bursa and may be associated with swelling. Prepatellar bursitis will present with egg-shaped swelling superficial to the patella. Septic bursitis may present with erythema and warmth. Radiologic knee series are usually normal. Evaluation with ultrasound will show a hypoechoic fluid filled sac or discrete fluid collection at the site of pain indicating bursitis.
Treatment: The treatment of bursitis-related knee pain is typically focused on reducing the inflammation of the bursa, itself – this includes ice, NSAIDs, activity modifications (such as knee pads for prepatellar bursitis), injections of corticosteroid, and therapeutic aspiration. For patients with active lifestyle or occupational demands and non-septic bursitis, intrabursal injection of corticosteroids provides acute pain relief. If septic bursitis is suspected, infectious workup includes blood sampling for evaluation of leukocytosis and aspiration of bursal fluid with gram stain and cell count. Treat septic bursitis with antibiotics. Recurrent or persistent severe bursitis may benefit from surgical interventions such as bursectomy.

### Dutch Multidisciplinary Guideline on anterior knee pain: patellofemoral pain and patellar tendinopathy [^224858bf]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

This guideline recommends starting with exercise therapy for PFP and PT. Additional conservative treatments are only indicated in the absence of clinically relevant changes and pain medications should be reserved for patients with severe pain. The additional value of imaging assessments for PT is limited. Open surgery may play a role in very specific cases. The recommendations in this guideline facilitate clinical decision‐making for healthcare providers in both primary and secondary care and thereby optimizing treatment and preventing unnecessary burdens, risks and costs to patients and society.

### Effect of resistance exercise dose components for tendinopathy management: a systematic review with meta-analysis [^1e0f266c]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

This review was part of a project funded by the National Institute for Health Research (Health Technology Assessment 129388 Exercise therapy for the treatment of tendinopathies) and adhered to an a priori protocol (PROSPERO 2020 CRD42020168187).

Inclusion criteria

Inclusion criteria and methods were influenced by the project aims, the results of an initial scoping reviewand two subsequent stakeholder workshops (n = 13). The first included nine individuals who delivered exercise therapy for tendinopathy and had an academic interest. The second included four women with lived experience. Finally, an online survey (n = 26) was conducted to gather the views of a more diverse international sample of purposefully selected clinicians and academics. A completed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic review and Meta-Analysis checklist for reporting of systematic reviews can be found in online supplemental file 1. The inclusion criteria were framed according to a modified PICOS (participant, intervention, comparator, outcomes, study type) approach which also included context.

Participants

This meta-analysis included people of any age or gender with a diagnosis of RCRSP, lateral elbow, patellar, Achilles or gluteal tendinopathy of any severity or duration. Due to difficulty in diagnosing the patho-anatomical cause of shoulder painthe term RCRSP is defined here as pain, impaired movement and function of the shoulder from one or more structures (encompassing subacromial pain/impingement syndrome (SIS), rotator cuff tendinopathy and subacromial bursitis). We included studies that described participants as having tendinopathy, SIS or RCRSP, thereby acknowledging that participants may have tendinopathy+/−involvement of other structures. Full thickness or large tears were excluded, for all tendinopathies. Trial authors' diagnoses were accepted where a clearly verifiable group of clinical features was reported including: pathognomonic location of pain; a symptom altering response to applied load and/or stretch, with there being a specific test for most tendinopathies; strategies to rule out differential diagnoses; ultrasound or MRI confirmation of structural change. Typically, a minimum of two clinical features were acceptable, however often more were reported. Data from studies with mixed groups were included where there was clear reporting of the tendinopathic group, or they comprised > 90% of the investigated cohort.

### Management of patellar tendinopathy: a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised studies [^5e050963]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Patellar tendinopathy describes persistent pain and dysfunction of the patellar tendon related to mechanical loading. It usually occurs as a response to overuse and has a complex, multifactorial pathology. The condition is more common in athletes who participate in sports that involve repetitive loading of the tendon, such as basketball and volleyball. Across all sports, up to 22% of elite athletes report patellar tendon pain at some point during their career. Diagnosis of patellar tendinopathy is clinical, with the patient often describing activity provoked localised tendon pain and stiffness. In the early stages, an individual can often continue activity. However, the pain can progress, resulting in chronic impairment with an average duration of 32 months.

Management can be divided into active and passive modalities. Active strategies mainly involve tendon-loading regimes, of which eccentric training has been the most popular, with a 50%–70% chance of improvement reported at 3–6 months follow-up. Recently, both isometric and heavy slow resistance (HSR) exercises were shown to be effective in reducing pain and improving function in patellar tendinopathy. There is a multitude of passive treatments for patellar tendinopathy, which include, but are not limited to, anti-inflammatory medications, corticosteroid and platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injections, iontophoresis, topical glyceryl trinitrate (GTN), extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT), low energy laser therapy and therapeutic ultrasound (US). Surgical intervention is usually considered when non-operative interventions have been unsuccessful. Definitive guidelines on the management of patellar tendinopathy do not currently exist.

We aimed to summarise the available evidence on the management of patellar tendinopathy both with direct comparisons between interventions and by producing treatment ranks with a network meta-analysis (NMA) using direct and indirect comparisons. We expect our findings will inform the formulation of future guidelines and guide further research.

### The management of the painful bipartite patella: a systematic review [^5b704261]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

This study aimed to identify the most effective method for the treatment of the symptomatic bipartite patella.

Methods

A systematic review of the literature was completed, and all studies assessing the management of a bipartite patella were included. Owing to the paucity of randomised controlled trials, a narrative review of 22 studies was completed. A range of treatments were assessed: conservative measures, open and arthroscopic fixation or excision and soft tissue release and excision.

Results

All of the methods provided results ranging from good to excellent, with acceptable complication rates.

Conclusions

This is a poorly answered treatment question. No firm guidance can be given as to the most appropriate method of treating the symptomatic bipartite patella. This study suggests that there are a number of effective treatments with acceptable complication rates and it may be that treatments that conserve the patella are more appropriate for larger fragments.

Results

Study characteristics

Online supplemental table 1 shows the characteristics of the included studies. A total of 37 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were found to be eligible, including 1332 patients (1407 tendons) with patellar tendinopathy (mean age 29.2 years). The majority of patients had chronic tendinopathy (> 3 months) and the mean duration of symptoms, where stated, was 25.7 months (range 1–120 months). The included studies assessed 33 interventions that were applied alone or in combination with other interventions. Follow-up ranged from immediate postintervention follow-up to 53 months. The most frequent follow-up time points were 12 and 24–26 weeks. Two studies only assessed immediate postintervention outcomes. All but 5 of the included studies included pain as an outcome; 31 studies used a numerical scale of 0–10 or 0–100 ('VAS' or 'Numerical Rating Scale') and 1 a non-numerical categorical scale. VISA-P was used in 30 studies.

Risk of bias assessment

Online supplemental table 2 shows the risk of bias assessment for each study, with the overall risk of bias as determined by the authors of the present review and justification for the high overall risk of bias decisions. Fifteen studies were considered with low and 22 with a high overall risk of bias.

Findings — pairwise meta-analyses

Online supplemental table 3 illustrates the results of the studies, with pooling where possible (two or more studies comparing the same interventions with results at the same follow-up periods) and the strength of evidence for each outcome measure for the pooled comparisons. Justifications are provided in the table legend for downgrading the strength of evidence where the GRADE tool was used.

The findings of the pooled results from meta-analysed data are presented below. All results based on single studies can be seen in the table and are not discussed further as they are considered to be of limited evidence; those from studies with a low overall risk of bias are underlined.

### Management of patellar instability: a network meta-analysis of randomized control trials [^364472ad]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Multiple surgical options exist for the treatment of patellar instability; however, the most common procedures involve either a reconstruction of the medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL) or a repair/plication of the MPFL and medial soft tissues.

Purpose

To perform a network meta-analysis of the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in the literature to compare MPFL reconstruction, MPFL repair, and nonoperative management for patellar instability.

Study Design

Systematic review and network meta-analysis; Level of evidence, 1.

Methods

The literature search was performed based on the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. RCTs comparing MPFL reconstruction, MPFL repair, and nonoperative management for patellar instability were included. Clinical outcomes included recurrent instability (including both dislocations and subluxations), redislocation, and Kujala score. Clinical outcomes were compared using a frequentist approach to network meta-analysis, with statistical analysis performed using the statistical software R. The treatment options were ranked using P scores.

Results

There were 13 RCTs with a total of 789 patients, all with a minimum follow-up of 24 months. There were 150 patients treated using MPFL reconstruction, 353 treated using MPFL repair, and 286 treated nonoperatively. Overall, MPFL reconstruction had the highest P score (0.9967) and resulted in a significantly lower recurrence rate than did MPFL repair (odds ratio [OR], 0.42; 95% CI, 0.07–0.72) and nonoperative management (OR, 0.09; 95% CI, 0.03–0.32). In addition, MPFL repair resulted in a significantly lower recurrence rate than did nonoperative management (OR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.25–0.70). MPFL reconstruction had the highest P score (0.9651) and resulted in a significantly higher Kujala score than did nonoperative management (mean difference, 10.45; 95% CI, 0.41–20.49) but not MPFL repair (mean difference, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.03–0.68). Subgroup analysis revealed that MPFL reconstruction had the highest P score for all outcomes in those with first-time dislocation.

Conclusion

The current study demonstrated that MPFL reconstruction results in the lowest rate of recurrent patellar instability and best functional outcomes as measured using the Kujala score.

### Patellar tendinopathy: diagnosis and treatment [^920733ff]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2016). Low credibility.

Patellar tendinopathy is a common cause of pain in athletes' knees. Historically, it has been related to jumping sports, such as volleyball and basketball. Repetitive jumping generates a considerable load of energy in the extensor mechanism, leading to symptoms. The main pathophysiologic phenomenon in patellar tendinopathy is tendinosis, which is a degenerative disorder rather than an inflammatory disorder; therefore, the other popular term for this disease, tendinitis, is not appropriate. The nonsurgical treatment of patellar tendinopathy is focused on eccentric exercises and often has good results. Other experimental options, with variable levels of evidence, are available for recalcitrant cases. Surgical treatment is indicated for cases that are refractory to nonsurgical treatment. Open or arthroscopic surgery can be performed; the two methods are comparable, but arthroscopic surgery results in a faster recovery time.

### Management of patellar tendinopathy [^6049fef2]. Arthroscopy (2024). Medium credibility.

Patellar tendinopathy is a common pathology typically seen in athletes involved in repetitive explosive jumping and running activities. Also known as jumpers' knee, it is commonly seen in high-level basketball players. Typically, athletes continue to play with symptoms, which can be aggravated and progress to partial patellar tendon tears. When partial patellar tendon tears occur, prolonged recovery and decreased performance is commonly seen. The pathology and treatment can be frustrating for both the athlete and medical provider. Patellar tendinopathy typically does not involve inflammation but rather microinjury to the tendon fibers, which leads to mucoid degeneration, necrosis, and loss of transitional fibrocartilage. When partial tendon tears do occur, the typical location is posteromedially adjacent to the patella. Treatment involves a stepwise approach starting with nonoperative means, including activity modification, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories, and physical therapy focused on eccentrics. Extracorporeal shock wave treatments and injections with platelet-rich plasma or bone marrow aspirate concentrate should be considered, with evolving literature to support their use. Ultrasound percutaneous tendon scrapping with a needle supplemented with the aforementioned injections is an emerging treatment option that the authors have found to be helpful, although further studies are required. Surgical intervention is considered after failure of nonoperative treatments, and typically occurs in tears greater than 50% of the tendon thickness and in tendons with increased thickness (> 8.8 mm). Open or arthroscopic debridement can be considered, with no studies showing superior outcomes with either technique; however, no high-quality comparison studies exist. The authors prefer an open technique where, much like a bone-patellar tendon-bone harvest, the unhealthy proximal tendon and bone are excised with then closure of the healthy tendon with absorbable sutures. Suture anchor repair may also be used when necessary. In a recent systematic review, surgical management of patellar tendinopathy has been shown to result in improved patient-reported outcomes with return to sport at high levels. 1 Treatment for the difficult and sometimes frustrating pathology of patellar tendinopathy continues to evolve, with biologic and less-invasive ultrasound-based treatments showing promise, and surgical intervention providing reliable outcomes.

Introduction:

With the advent of new classification systems and surgical options, clarification is needed regarding the most effective surgical management for refractory patellar tendinopathy (PT). The objective of this systematic review is to investigate outcomes of surgical management of refractory PT.

Methods:

PubMed was searched from January 1, 2000, through July 12, 2021, using the Medical Subject Headings function and the following Boolean operators: "Patellar Ligament/surgery"[Mesh] NOT "Anterior Cruciate Ligament"[Mesh]. Original research articles that discussed surgical management of PT were included, and outcomes were recorded.

Results:

Fifteen studies (2 studies level 1 and 13 studies level 4) were included comprising 485 patients with an average age of 29.5 years and 523 patellar tendons treated. The seven studies reporting both preoperative and postoperative Victorian Institute of Sports Assessment scores demonstrated increases of 39.60, whereas the seven studies reporting visual analog scores demonstrated decreases of 6.11. Average return-to-play rate was 87.08%. Study designs and in surgical techniques were heterogenous, which precluded the ability to perform a meta-analysis.

Discussion:

Surgical treatment of refractory PT leads to notable improvement in patient-reported outcomes and high return-to-play rates. However, there is a paucity of high-quality research investigating newer surgical options and classification systems for PT.

Data extraction — handling

The primary author (DC) extracted the key characteristics of each eligible article and inserted in tables in Microsoft Word to facilitate analysis and presentation.

For the presentation of results, outcomes were divided into short term (≤ 12-week follow-up), mid-term (˃12 weeks– ≤ 12-month follow-up) and long term (˃12 months follow-up). All short-term follow-up time points were converted to weeks and mid-term follow-up time points to months for consistency and easier analysis.

Comparisons of interventions reported by two or more studies at similar follow-up time points were pooled quantitatively by pairwise meta-analyses in the absence of significant clinical heterogeneity. Raw mean differences (MD) with their accompanying 95% CI were calculated and used in the tests as the tools used across studies were the same. Finally, an NMA was conducted for both outcome measures (pain VAS and VISA-P) at each follow-up period where adequate data existed.

Where pain results were reported in different settings (eg, at rest, at night, during sports) in studies, pain during sports was preferentially used. Placebo/sham treatment was considered as no treatment in both the pairwise and NMAs.

### A systematic review of surgical treatment for refractory patellar tendinopathy [^07121f64]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Historically, PT has been a challenging condition to treat, with unclear indications as to which patients would benefit from surgery versus nonsurgical management. New classification systems have been developed that may help guide physicians in deciding the patients to be treated surgically and the procedure most ideal for any given pathology. When surgery is indicated for patients with recalcitrant PT, there are several surgical techniques available. This review identified surgical techniques of varying invasiveness with great heterogeneity in design and technique that led to successful patient-reported outcomes and RTP rates. However, there is a dearth of high-quality comparative studies investigating newer techniques such as suture or autograft versus allograft augmentation. Future studies warrant prospective randomized trials and biomechanical studies for varying degrees of PT based on newer classification systems to optimize treatment based on the spectrum of PT pathology.

### Patellar tendinopathy: clinical diagnosis, load management, and advice for challenging case presentations [^ec32dfc4]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2015). Low credibility.

Synopsis The hallmark features of patellar tendinopathy are (1) pain localized to the inferior pole of the patella and (2) load-related pain that increases with the demand on the knee extensors, notably in activities that store and release energy in the patellar tendon. While imaging may assist in differential diagnosis, the diagnosis of patellar tendinopathy remains clinical, as asymptomatic tendon pathology may exist in people who have pain from other anterior knee sources. A thorough examination is required to diagnose patellar tendinopathy and contributing factors. Management of patellar tendinopathy should focus on progressively developing load tolerance of the tendon, the musculoskeletal unit, and the kinetic chain, as well as addressing key biomechanical and other risk factors. Rehabilitation can be slow and sometimes frustrating. This review aims to assist clinicians with key concepts related to examination, diagnosis, and management of patellar tendinopathy. Difficult clinical presentations (eg, highly irritable tendon, systemic comorbidities) as well as common pitfalls, such as unrealistic rehabilitation time frames and overreliance on passive treatments, are also discussed.

### Patellar management in revision total knee arthroplasty: is patellar resurfacing a better option? [^cd564097]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2010). Low credibility.

The management of the patella during revision total knee arthroplasty (TKA) depends on the indication for revision, the type and stability of the patellar component in place, and availability of bone stock. We prospectively compared the clinical outcome and satisfaction rates in revision TKA patients managed with patellar resurfacing (n = 13, group I) to retention of the patellar component (n = 22, group II) or patelloplasty (n = 11, group III) at a minimum follow-up of 2 years. There were no differences in the improvement of Knee Society Scores, Short-Form 36 Scores, and satisfaction rates between the groups. There were no revision surgeries for patellar component failure or patellar fractures. Satisfactory results can be achieved using a variety of methods of patellar management in revision TKA by individualizing the treatment modality depending on the clinical scenario.

### Dutch Multidisciplinary Guideline on anterior knee pain: patellofemoral pain and patellar tendinopathy [^1afe1727]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

The expert panel advocates for the use of paracetamol (acetaminophen) as the first choice of pain medication in select cases of patients with PFP and PT; however, no evidence exists regarding the effectiveness of this specific drug and no evidence for the use of this drug during training is available. Although the expert panel currently sees no role for injection therapy, including cell therapies, in the management of patients with PT, available evidence suggests that this perspective may change in the future with the emergence of RCTs featuring larger sample sizes and long‐term follow‐ups.

Patients with PFP or PT also reported receiving a whole range of conservative treatments (additional to exercise therapy or as stand‐alone treatments), while our literature research regarding these treatments concluded that scientific evidence for these additional treatments is either absent or had a 'very low GRADE' to 'low GRADE' (online Supporting Information modules 'Additional conservative treatments' and 'Pain medications' for PFP and PT). Therefore, the expert panel formulated weaker recommendations regarding these interventions. Despite the absence of scientific evidence for open surgery, the expert panel felt an urgent need to formulate a cautious but decisive recommendation for an orthopaedic assessment to ascertain the indication for open surgery. This is reserved for nonresponders to diligent exercise therapy or exercise therapy plus additional conservative treatments for at least six months. In cases of distinct anatomical pathology, such as central patellar tendon necrosis, more prompt surgical intervention may be warranted.

Risk of bias — strength of evidence assessment

The internal validity (freedom from bias) of each included study was assessed with the 'Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing the risk of bias in randomised trials' separately by DC and MB, and a third independent opinion (NLM) was sought where disagreements existed. Overall, studies were characterised as of 'low', 'high' or 'unclear' overall risk of bias with the use of the authors' judgement based on whether they thought the possible bias identified in the subcomponents of the Cochrane tool could have influenced the true results of the study.

The strength of evidence was assessed with the GRADE tool, where the results of two or more studies were pooled in pairwise meta-analyses and with the GRADE-NMA tool for NMAs. Strength of evidence assessment was performed by DC and MB independently and any disagreements were resolved by discussion and involvement of a third assessor (NLM). The strength of evidence of each outcome measure within each comparison was assessed separately. Our recommendations for clinical practice were based on results of either 'high' or 'moderate' strength of evidence with both clinical and statistical significance. Clinical significance was defined as at least 1.5 points difference in pain VAS and 13 points in VISA-P between the compared interventions and these thresholds were also used as the minimal clinically relevant difference (MCRD) as part of the 'imprecision' risk assessment of the GRADE tool.

As part of the GRADE-NMA tool, the certainty of the evidence of the direct estimate was rated first using the overall risk of bias, inconsistency (statistical heterogeneity), indirectness (clinical heterogeneity) and publication bias. Subsequently, the indirect estimate was rated using the lowest ratings of the two direct comparisons forming the most dominant first-order loops and intransitivity (differences in study characteristics of studies used in indirect comparisons). Finally, the network estimate was rated using the highest certainty of evidence between direct and indirect estimates, the incoherence (difference between direct and indirect comparisons — assessed using the 'node splitting' approach) and imprecision.

### Nonsurgical treatments of patellar tendinopathy: multiple injections of platelet-rich plasma are a suitable option: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^9f84589a]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Patellar tendinopathy is a condition characterized by anterior knee activity-related pain. It has a high incidence among athletes engaged in jumping sports and may become a chronic condition. Nonoperative management is the first choice in these patients, and several nonsurgical treatment options have been proposed. Nonetheless, clear indications on the most effective approach to address patellar tendinopathy are still lacking.

Purpose

To analyze the evidence on nonoperative options to treat chronic patellar tendinopathy through a systematic review of the literature and to perform a meta-analysis to identify the most effective nonsurgical option.

Study Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis.

Methods

The search was conducted with the PubMed and Cochrane databases on January 4, 2017. All clinical English-language reports of any level of evidence on nonsurgical treatment of patellar tendinopathy were included. The quality of each article was assessed by use of the Coleman score. A meta-analysis was performed on all articles reporting the Victorian Institute of Sport Assessment scale for patellar tendinopathy to evaluate the results of the most described treatments.

Results

A total of 70 studies involving 2530 patients were included in the qualitative data synthesis. The Coleman score showed an overall poor study quality. The most described treatment groups that could be included in the meta-analysis were reported in 22 studies on eccentric exercise, extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT), and platelet-rich plasma (PRP). Single and multiple PRP injections were evaluated separately. Eccentric exercise therapies obtained the best results (P < .05) at short-term (< 6 months, mean 2.7 ± 0.7 months). However, multiple injections of PRP obtained the best results (P < .05), followed by ESWT and eccentric exercise, at long-term follow-up (≥ 6 months, mean 15.1 ± 11.3 months).

Conclusion

The literature documents several nonsurgical approaches for the treatment of chronic patellar tendinopathy with important limitations in terms of study quality. The available evidence showed an overall positive outcome, but some differences have been highlighted. Eccentric exercises may seem the strategy of choice in the short-term, but multiple PRP injections may offer more satisfactory results at long-term follow-up and can be therefore considered a suitable option for the treatment of patellar tendinopathy.

### Therapeutic interventions in children and adolescents with patellar tendon related pain: a systematic review [^a7fd48eb]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Patellar tendon related pain conditions are common in children and adolescents, appear to begin in childhood and increase in prevalence during adolescence up to age 18. Patellar tendon related pain is an umbrella term, which encompasses Osgood-Schlatter's disease (OSD), Sinding-Larsen-Johansson disease and patellar tendinopathy. OSD affects 1 in 10 adolescents and as many as 1 in 5 in certain sports. There is a paucity of high-quality evidence relating to prognosis.

In one prospective cohort study in 18 adolescents with OSD, even 2 years after initial diagnosis, over 60% demonstrated persistent patellar tendon changes (evaluated by ultrasonography) and continued to display deficits in functional performance. Individuals with a history of OSD can experience persistent pain, years later, in their early 20s, associated with OSD lesions, underscoring that these pain complaints may not go away on their own if treated with a 'wait and see' approach. Interventions which reliably improve long-term outcomes are needed.

While there is a large body of randomised trials and high-quality systematic reviews for managing patellar tendon related disorders in adults, there is a complete lack of systematic evaluations of treatment strategies specifically for adolescents and children. Considering patellar tendon related pain seem to start around the age of 10, there is a need for evidence and syntheses specific to this population. This is especially important considering some of these patellar tendon related pain complaints are unique to adolescent period, for example, Sinding-Larsen-Johansson syndrome and OSD.

The aim of this study was to perform a systematic review (and if possible, meta-analysis) of the benefits and harms of different treatment options for patella tendon related pain in children and adolescents.

### Acute patellar tendon ruptures: an update on management [^644ef59f]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Patellar tendon ruptures are relatively rare injuries that disrupt the distal aspect of the extensor mechanism. The injury is most commonly seen in men in their third or fourth decade of life and in those with systemic conditions that compromise tendon integrity. Primary repair is the mainstay of treatment of complete patellar tendon ruptures. Historically, this was primarily achieved with transosseous tunnels; however, suture anchors can also be used and have been reported to be gaining in popularity. In acute or chronic tears where the tendon cannot be adequately repaired, reconstruction can be achieved with various allograft and autograft options.

### Surgery for patellar tendinopathy (jumper's knee) [^0e4f81e0]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Patellar tendinopathy is an overuse condition that commonly affects athletes. Surgery is usually offered if medical and physical therapies fail to treat it effectively. There is variation in the type of surgery performed for the condition.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of surgery for patellar tendinopathy in adults.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases, to 17 July 2018: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) via the Cochrane Library, OVID MEDLINE, OVID Embase, clinical trial registries (www. ClinicalTrials.gov) and the WHO trials portal (www.who.int/ictrp/en/).

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared surgical techniques (open or arthroscopic) with non-operative treatment (including placebo surgery, exercise or other non-surgical modalities) in adults with patellar tendinopathy. Major outcomes assessed were knee pain, function, quality of life, participant global assessment of success, withdrawal rate, proportion with adverse events and proportion with tendon rupture.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors selected studies for inclusion, extracted trial characteristics and outcome data, assessed the risk of bias and assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE.

Main Results

Two trials (92 participants) met our inclusion criteria. Participants in both trials were followed for 12 months. Neither trial compared surgery to placebo surgery. One trial (40 randomised participants) compared open surgical excision with eccentric exercises, and the other compared arthroscopic surgery with sclerosing injections (52 randomised participants). Due to the nature of the interventions, neither the participants or the investigators were blinded to the group allocation, resulting in the potential for performance and detection bias. Some outcomes were selectively not recorded, leading to reporting bias. Overall, the certainty of the evidence from these studies was low for all outcomes due to the potential for bias, and imprecision due to small sample sizes. Compared with eccentric exercises, low-certainty evidence indicates that open surgical excision provides no clinically important benefits with respect to knee pain, function or global assessment of success. At 12 months, mean knee pain - measured by pain with standing jump on a 10-point scale (lower scores indicating less pain) - was 1.7 points (standard deviation (SD) 1.6) in the eccentric training group and 1.3 (SD 0.8) in the surgical group (one trial, 40 participants). This equates to an absolute pain reduction of 4% (ranging from 4% worse to 12% better, the minimal clinically important difference being 15%) and a relative reduction in pain of 10% better (ranging from 30% better to 10% worse) in the treatment group. At 12 months, function on the zero- to 100-point Victorian Institute of Sport Assessment (VISA) scale was 65.7 (SD 23.8) in the eccentric training group and 72.9 (SD 11.7) in the surgical group (one trial, 40 participants). This equates to an absolute change of 7% better function (ranging from 4% worse to 19% better) and relative change of 25% better (ranging from 15% worse to 65% better, the minimal clinically important difference being 13%). Participant global assessment of success was measured by the number of people with no pain at 12 months: 7/20 participants in the eccentric training group reported no pain, compared with 5/20 in the open surgical group (risk ratio (RR) 0.71 (95% CI 0.27 to 1.88); one trial, 40 participants). There were no withdrawals, but five out of 20 people from the eccentric exercise group crossed over to open surgical excision. Quality of life, adverse events and tendon ruptures were not measured. Compared with sclerosing injection, low-certainty evidence indicates that arthroscopic surgery may provide a reduction in pain and improvement in participant global assessment of success, however further studies are likely to change these results. At 12 months, mean pain with activities, measured on a 100-point scale (lower scores indicating less pain), was 41.1 (SD 28.5) in the sclerosing injection group and 12.8 (SD 19.3) in the arthroscopic surgery group (one trial, 52 participants). This equates to an absolute pain reduction of 28% better (ranging from 15% to 42% better, the minimal clinically important difference being 15%), and a relative change of 41% better (ranging from 21% to 61% better). At 12 months, the mean participant global assessment of success, measured by satisfaction on a 100-point scale (scale zero to 100, higher scores indicating greater satisfaction), was 52.9 (SD 32.6) in the sclerosing injection group and 86.8 (SD 20.8) in the arthroscopic surgery group (one trial, 52 participants). This equates to an absolute improvement of 34% (ranging from 19% to 49%). In both groups, one participant (4%) withdrew from the study. Functional outcome scores, including the VISA score, were not reported. Quality-of-life assessment, adverse events, and specifically the proportion with a tendon rupture, were not reported. We did not perform subgroup analysis to assess differences in outcome between arthroscopic or open surgical excision, as we did not identify more than one study with a common comparator.

Authors' Conclusions

We are uncertain if surgery is beneficial over other therapeutic interventions, namely eccentric exercises or injectables. Low-certainty evidence shows that surgery for patellar tendinopathy may not provide clinically important benefits over eccentric exercise in terms of pain, function or participant-reported treatment success, but may provide clinically meaningful pain reduction and treatment success when compared with sclerosing injections. However, further research is likely to change these results. The evidence was downgraded two levels due to the small sample sizes and susceptibility to bias. We are uncertain if there are additional risks associated with surgery as study authors failed to report adverse events. Surgery seems to be embedded in clinical practice for late-stage patella tendinopathy, due to exhaustion of other therapeutic methods rather than evidence of benefit.

### Image-guided intervention in the management of chronic patellar tendinopathy with calcification: a three-pronged approach [^4c421718]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Patellar tendinopathy is a common cause of knee pain and functional impairment in athletes. It is commonly managed using conservative measures such as physiotherapy, but cases that are refractory to such treatment may require a more invasive approach. Various forms of image-guided injection therapy have been described in the literature. We present a case of successful treatment of chronic patellar tendinopathy with calcification with the first reported use of a three-pronged image-guided approach, consisting of dry needling, high volume image-guided injection (but at a reduced dose) and barbotage applied in a single sitting. The patient reported resolution of symptoms persisting to 1year postprocedure. We suggest that this management option, if supported by further positive research findings, could be used in the future in the management of certain cases of patellar tendinopathy with calcification where conservative measures have failed.

### Management of first-time patellar dislocation: the ESSKA 2024 formal consensus-part 2 [^2ced4eb7]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To provide recommendations for the treatment of patients with first-time patellar dislocation (FTPD). Part 2 focused on nonoperative treatment, bracing, rehabilitation, indications for surgery and surgical strategies.

Methods

The consensus was performed according to the European Society for Sports Traumatology, Knee Surgery and Arthroscopy consensus methodology.

Results

The consensus comprised 32 questions and statements, 19 of which will be presented in this part. Eight statements achieved strong agreement (median 9; range 7–9), and 11 statements achieved relative agreement (median 9; range 5–9). None were Grade A, 2 were Grade B, 11 were Grade C and 5 were Grade D. In summary, treatment decisions for FTPD should prioritize individualized care, balancing patient-specific risks and demands. Surgical options are increasingly considered for skeletally immature patients and those with increased recurrence risk. Medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL) reconstruction is the preferred surgical technique for addressing medial soft tissue stabilizers, offering better outcomes than repair methods. Combining MPFL reconstruction with corrections of relevant bony risk factors might further reduce the risk of recurrence and revision surgery, although specific thresholds for intervention remain debated. Physical therapy is recommended as an essential complement to both operative and nonoperative treatments, but bracing offers no clear long-term benefit. Chondral or osteochondral lesions should be repaired when the defect is at least 1cm² in the patellofemoral joint contact area. Fragment refixation or other cartilage restoration techniques are preferred, and delayed repair is favoured over fragment removal when immediate surgery is not needed.

Conclusion

The consensus consists of recommendations for evaluation and treatment strategies for managing FTPD. High levels of agreement were reached by experts throughout Europe. In areas without clear scientific evidence, this consensus aimed at providing recommendations and guidance on the basis of expert opinion and pointed out areas where further studies are necessary.

Level Of Evidence

Level I consensus.

### Editorial commentary: what is the optimal management of first and recurrent patellar instability? Patellofemoral instability management continues to evolve [^1aa76b84]. Arthroscopy (2018). Low credibility.

Patellar instability patients may present for evaluation after their first instability episode or after recurrent episodes. Current management differs for these 2 groups. The accepted "common denominator" of patellar instability is the medial patellofemoral ligament, or medial patellar restraints, to be more all-encompassing. These patients often have multiple contributing comorbidities (e.g., trochlear dysplasia, patellar alta, excessive lateral position of tibial tubercle). Historically, the recommended treatment for a first-time patellar dislocation was nonoperative because medial soft tissue repairs had not been proven more effective. Indications for primary repair of the medial patellar restraints are a single discrete tear identified on magnetic resonance imaging. In the case of recurrent patellar instability, medial patellofemoral ligament reconstruction, rather than repair/reef, has been the recommended approach. The keys to reconstruction remain: honor the anatomy and avoid overconstraint of the patella. For first time dislocation patients with trochlear dysplasia, patellar alta, and age < 25 years, recurrent instability is common.

### Dutch Multidisciplinary Guideline on anterior knee pain: patellofemoral pain and patellar tendinopathy [^20949d87]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Purpose

The purpose of this study was to develop a multidisciplinary guideline for patellofemoral pain (PFP) and patellar tendinopathy (PT) to facilitate clinical decision‐making in primary and secondary care.

Methods

A multidisciplinary expert panel identified questions in clinical decision‐making. Based on a systematic literature search, the strength of the scientific evidence was determined according to the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) method and the weight assigned to the considerations by the expert panel together determined the strength of the recommendations.

Results

After confirming PFP or PT as a clinical diagnosis, patients should start with exercise therapy. Additional conservative treatments are indicated only when exercise therapy does not result in clinically relevant changes after six (PFP) or 12 (PT) weeks. Pain medications should be reserved for cases of severe pain. The additional value of imaging assessments for PT is limited. Open surgery is reserved for very specific cases of nonresponders to exercise therapy and those requiring additional conservative treatments. Although the certainty of evidence regarding exercise therapy for PFP and PT had to be downgraded ('very low GRADE' and 'low GRADE'), the expert panel advocates its use as the primary treatment strategy. The panel further formulated weaker recommendations regarding additional conservative treatments, pain medications, imaging assessments and open surgery ('very low GRADE' to 'low GRADE' assessment or absence of scientific evidence).

Conclusion

This guideline recommends starting with exercise therapy for PFP and PT. The recommendations facilitate clinical decision‐making, and thereby optimizing treatment and preventing unnecessary burdens, risks and costs to patients and society.

Level of Evidence

Level V, clinical practice guideline.

Although Baker's cyst therapy depends on the primary cause, percutaneous interventions can be safely performed under US guidance. In patients with knee osteoarthritis, US-guided Baker's cyst aspiration and corticosteroid-anesthetic injection have shown significant pain relief and cyst diameters decrease up to 4 and 8 weeks. Direct Baker's cyst injection gave a greater size reduction and better clinical outcomes compared to an anterior knee joint injection at 4- and 8-week follow-up. Aspiration and corticosteroid injection performed better than stand-alone physical therapy, even though their combination further ameliorated symptoms. At long-term follow-up in patients with knee osteoarthritis or other knee pathologies, US-guided aspiration, wall fenestration in the case of multilocular cysts, and injection of anesthetic and corticosteroid showed similar clinical benefit by relieving pain and reducing cyst volume. A significant correlation exists between volume reduction and clinical improvement. Baker's cyst recurrence was noted in complex cysts, without any significant pain change between the patients with simple and complex cysts. Close follow-up may be advantageous so the treatment can be repeated in case of recurrence. In two case reports, US-guided sclerotherapy with hypertonic dextrose has been used as a treatment option for Baker's cyst treatment, but the clinical value has not still been demonstrated. US-guided intervention in Baker's cyst when visually observed by the patient can be used as a positive bio-feedback, favorably affecting the treatment outcome.
10 US-guided corticosteroid injections are more effective than blind injections to treat pes anserinus bursitis, but the added value of imaging to guide other periarticular injections (excluding patellar tendon and Baker's cyst) has not been demonstrated.

Scoping question: What is the optimal form of exercise therapy for patients with PT?

Background: Treatment of PT using exercise therapy is the most substantiated treatment in the literature; when an adjunct conservative treatment is chosen, it is regularly combined with exercise therapy. However, there is ambiguity regarding the type of exercise therapy that should be administered. Moreover, there is limited knowledge about the effectiveness of different exercise therapy programmes; frequency, intensity, type and time factors; and duration of continued exercise therapy after return to activity (sports/work).

The aim of this module was to elucidate the effectiveness of specific exercise therapy in patients with PT compared to other types of specific exercise therapy or a control group.

Evidence review: Five RCTs were included ('very low GRADE').

Rationale: Despite the low level of evidence, the expert panel advocates for the use of exercise therapy as the first choice for patients with PT. Although there is no 'one size fits all plan', the expert panel suggests the use of a four‐stage treatment plan based on Rudavsky and Cook (2014).

Recommendations:

Use the following four‐step‐treatment‐plan to treat patients with PT(Figure 2): 1 Pain management: Patient education and loading advice. 2 Strength progression: ▪ A progressive resistance exercise programme for the quadriceps should be performed for at least 12 weeks while continuously adjusting exercise intensity for the individual patient. ▪ Heavy slow resistance training is preferred, although different types of training programmes/contractions (e.g. isometric contractions) may be used to minimize the reactive pain response of the patellar tendon. 3 Energy storage/stretch‐shorten cycle: Depending on the type of sport, start with plyometric exercises. 4 Maintenance of muscle strength.
Additional conservative treatments should be considered when, after 12 weeks of thorough exercise therapy (including education and loading advice), no clinically relevant changes occur (Module 6: 'Additional conservative treatments for PT' and Module 7: 'Pain medications for PT').

### How does surgery compare to sham surgery or physiotherapy as a treatment for tendinopathy? A systematic review of randomised trials [^92a15f50]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Methods

The present systematic review has been conducted and authored according to the ' Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses'(PRISMA) guidelines (figure 1).

Figure 1
PRISMA flow diagram of included studies. PRISMA, Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses.

Eligibility

Included studies had a randomised design and compared surgery to any mode of non-surgical management for any type of tendinopathy in terms of at least one of the following outcomes: 'pain', 'function', 'ROM', 'force/strength', 'patient satisfaction', 'treatment success', 'QoL', 'complications'. Non-randomised observational studies, case reports, case series and literature reviews were excluded. Participants had to be over 18 years of age with a clinical diagnosis of tendinopathy with or without radiological signs. Studies including patients with full tendon tears were excluded. Duration of symptoms/signs was not a criterion, neither was length of conservative treatment and follow-up. Language criterion was not applied.

Search strategy

A thorough literature search was conducted by two of the authors (DC and CC) independently via Medline, EMBASE, Scopus and CINAHL in March 2018, with the following Boolean operators: '(tendinopathy OR tendinosis OR tendinitis OR tendonitis OR tennis elbow OR jumper's knee OR lateral elbow tendinopathy OR lateral epicondylitis OR rotator cuff disease OR shoulder impingement OR patellar OR Achilles) AND (surgery OR surgical management OR surgical treatment OR tenotomy OR open surgery OR arthroscopic surgery) AND (conservative management OR conservative treatment OR physiotherapy OR eccentric exercises OR eccentric strengthening OR stretching OR shock-wave therapy OR ESWT OR extracorporeal shock wave therapy OR ultrasound OR iontophoresis OR laser OR LLLT OR polidocanol OR sclerotherapy OR botox OR botulinum toxin OR GTN OR glyceryl trinitrate OR nitroglycerin OR corticosteroid injections OR platelet rich plasma OR PRP OR autologous blood OR sham surgery)'.

### Isolated tuberculosis of the patella mimicking as prepatellar bursitis [^ac94a736]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Patellar tuberculosis (TB) is a rare manifestation of musculoskeletal tuberculosis, accounting for a small proportion of cases. This case report presents a detailed analysis of a female patient in her early 30s who presented with isolated TB of the patella without concurrent pulmonary involvement. The patient received antitubercular chemotherapy, consisting of a 4-month intensive phase followed by an 8-month continuation phase. This case report underscores the rarity and diagnostic complexities associated with patellar TB. The condition often presents with non-specific symptoms, often mimicking prepatellar bursitis, necessitating a high level of clinical suspicion, particularly in patients from the endemic areas. Radiographic imaging and histopathological examination play crucial roles in establishing an accurate diagnosis. Antitubercular chemotherapy forms the cornerstone of treatment while surgical intervention is reserved for cases of extensive bone destruction or treatment failure.

### Exercise for patellar tendinopathy [^0fdeebb3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Patellar tendinopathy is a prevalent condition that commonly affects the tendon's origin, causing pain at the front of the knee. The main treatment for patellar tendinopathy involves different types of exercise (e.g. strengthening and stretching). The most common method of strengthening exercise is eccentric (lengthening) muscle loading. Strengthening exercises can be land-based or water-based, weight-bearing or non-weight-bearing, or both. Other treatments include surgery and glucocorticoid injections.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of exercise for the treatment of patellar tendinopathy.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and two trials registers to 5 September 2023, with no restrictions by language.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials of strengthening exercise interventions compared to placebo or sham intervention; no treatment, usual care, or minimal intervention; or other active intervention. Strengthening exercises include concentric, eccentric, eccentric-concentric, and isometric exercises designed to enhance the strength and power of muscles.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias and certainty of evidence using GRADE. Major outcomes included pain, function, participant-reported global assessment of treatment success, quality of life, return to sport, proportion of participants with adverse events, and proportion of participant withdrawals.

Main Results

We included seven trials (211 participants with chronic patellar tendinopathy) comparing strengthening exercises with no treatment (3 trials, 93 participants), glucocorticoid injection (1 trial, 38 participants), surgery (1 trial, 40 participants), stretching exercise (1 trial, 15 participants), or pulsed ultrasound and transverse friction (1 trial, 30 participants). All trials included athletes (88% males, mean age 26 years) with a mean duration of symptoms of 41.6 months. Most trials were susceptible to bias, particularly selection bias/random sequence (57.1%), selection bias/allocation concealment (42.8%), detection bias (28.5%), attrition bias (71.4%), and selective reporting biases (28.5%). Given the nature of the intervention, neither participants nor investigators were blinded to group allocation in any trials (performance bias). We did not find any studies that compared exercise with placebo or sham intervention. Strengthening exercise versus no treatment We are very uncertain whether strengthening exercise reduces pain compared to no treatment. Mean pain with no treatment was 62.00 points on a 0 to 100 scale (0 = no pain) compared to 27.06 points with exercise (mean difference (MD) 34.94 points better, 95% confidence interval (CI) 20.94 better to 48.94 better; 1 study, 39 participants; very low-certainty evidence (downgraded twice for imprecision and once for bias)). Strengthening exercise may make little or no difference to function compared to no treatment at the end of treatment. Mean function with no treatment was 65.00 points on a 0 to 100 scale (100 = best function) compared to 72.04 points with exercise (MD 7.04 points better, 95% CI 6.94 points worse to 21.02 points better; 2 studies, 95 participants; low-certainty evidence (downgraded once for imprecision and once for bias)). The studies reported none of the other outcomes. Strengthening exercise versus glucocorticoid injection Strengthening exercise may make little or no difference to pain compared to glucocorticoid injection at the end of treatment. Mean pain with glucocorticoid injection was 18.00 points on a 0 to 100 scale (0 = no pain) compared to 24.04 points with exercise (MD 6.04 points worse, 95% CI 8.19 better to 20.26 better; 1 trial, 38 participants; low-certainty evidence (downgraded twice for imprecision)). Strengthening exercise may make little or no difference to function compared to glucocorticoid injection at the end of treatment. Mean function with no treatment was 82.00 points on a 0 to 100 scale (100 = best function) compared to 76.25 points with exercise (MD 5.75 points worse, 95% CI 17.41 worse to 5.93 better; 1 trial, 38 participants; low-certainty evidence (downgraded twice for imprecision)). The trial reported none of the other outcomes. Strengthening exercise versus surgery We are very uncertain whether strengthening exercise reduces pain compared to surgery at 12-month follow-up. Mean pain with surgery was 13.00 points on a 0 to 100 scale (0 = no pain) compared to 17.00 points with exercise (MD 4.00 points worse, 95% CI 4.06 better to 12.06 worse; 1 trial, 40 participants; very low-certainty evidence). We are very uncertain whether strengthening exercise improves function compared to surgery. Mean function in the surgery group at the end of treatment was 45.10 points on a 0 to 100 scale (100 = best function) compared to 52.4 points in the exercise group (MD 7.30 points better, 95% CI 5.02 worse to 19.62 better; 1 trial, 40 participants; very low-certainty evidence (downgraded once for bias and twice for serious imprecision)). Strengthening exercise may make little or no difference to treatment success compared to surgery at the end of treatment. The mean global assessment of treatment success with surgery was 0.2 points on a -5 to +5 scale (+5 maximum was improvement) compared to 1.76 points with exercise (MD 1.56 points better, 95% CI 0.52 worse to 3.64 better; 1 trial, 40 participants; low-certainty evidence (downgraded once for bias and once for imprecision)). Strengthening exercise may make little or no difference to the rate of participants who returned fully or partially to sport when compared to surgery at 12-month follow-up. The return to sport rate with surgery was 86% compared to 85% with exercise (risk ratio 1.02, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.34; 1 trial, 40 participants; low-certainty evidence (downgraded once for bias and once for imprecision)). The trial reported none of the other outcomes.

Authors' Conclusions

We are very uncertain whether strengthening exercise reduces pain compared to no treatment. Strengthening exercise may make little or no difference to function compared to no treatment and to function or pain compared to glucocorticoid injection. Compared to surgery, we are very uncertain whether strengthening exercise reduces pain or improves function, and it may make little or no difference to treatment success and the proportion of athletes returning to sport. No trials measured adverse events. All trials analyzed in this review included participants who were athletes, limiting the findings to athletes rather than the general public.

### Dutch Multidisciplinary Guideline on anterior knee pain: patellofemoral pain and patellar tendinopathy [^5dffcfc9]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The purpose of this study was to develop a multidisciplinary guideline for patellofemoral pain (PFP) and patellar tendinopathy (PT) to facilitate clinical decision-making in primary and secondary care.

Methods

A multidisciplinary expert panel identified questions in clinical decision-making. Based on a systematic literature search, the strength of the scientific evidence was determined according to the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) method and the weight assigned to the considerations by the expert panel together determined the strength of the recommendations.

Results

After confirming PFP or PT as a clinical diagnosis, patients should start with exercise therapy. Additional conservative treatments are indicated only when exercise therapy does not result in clinically relevant changes after six (PFP) or 12 (PT) weeks. Pain medications should be reserved for cases of severe pain. The additional value of imaging assessments for PT is limited. Open surgery is reserved for very specific cases of nonresponders to exercise therapy and those requiring additional conservative treatments. Although the certainty of evidence regarding exercise therapy for PFP and PT had to be downgraded ('very low GRADE' and 'low GRADE'), the expert panel advocates its use as the primary treatment strategy. The panel further formulated weaker recommendations regarding additional conservative treatments, pain medications, imaging assessments and open surgery ('very low GRADE' to 'low GRADE' assessment or absence of scientific evidence).

Conclusion

This guideline recommends starting with exercise therapy for PFP and PT. The recommendations facilitate clinical decision-making, and thereby optimizing treatment and preventing unnecessary burdens, risks and costs to patients and society.

### Patellar maltracking: an update on the diagnosis and treatment strategies [^67cffd4b]. Insights Into Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

Features that may predispose to patellar dislocation and/or patellar maltracking and can be evaluated with CT include patellar and trochlear morphology and the alignment between the two structures. These morphological risk factors can be assessed using methods similar to those on MRI as detailed in the prior sections of this article. In acute patellar dislocation, CT may demonstrate osseous impaction or fractures of the medial margin of the patella (with or without involvement of the articular surface) and/or the lateral surface of the lateral femoral condyle and intraarticular fragments. Soft tissue changes may include effusion, thickening or disruption of the MPFL, and retinacular complex and regional edema.

Synopsis of treatment strategies

The goal of patellar instability treatment is to achieve a stable, functional, and pain-free knee and ultimately to halt or slow the development of osteoarthritis. It can be divided into nonoperative and operative management. The literature in this field has been extremely heterogeneous, and this has made clinical guidelines difficult to produce. A 2015 Cochrane Review concluded that there is no significant increase in functional scores between nonoperative and operative management; however, surgical management does result in a significantly lower risk of recurrent dislocation at the cost of surgical complications. Therefore, the management of patellar maltracking remains controversial and decisions need to be made on an individual patient basis with surgical management being reserved for those patients with documented recurrent lateral patellar instability.

Non-operative management

For first-time dislocators without intra-articular loose bodies or chondral injury, a trial of nonoperative therapy is indicated. This treatment generally consists of the use of anti-inflammatory medications, a short period of immobilization (3–6 weeks) followed by a progressive physiotherapy regimen with focus on range of motion, closed chain exercises, and vastus medialis obliquus strengthening. Adjunctive treatments such as knee aspiration and patellar stabilizing braces have been proposed to decrease swelling and enable early range of motion; however, there is no conclusive evidence for their use.

Despite non-operative management, recurrent patellar instability occurs in between 15 and 45% of patients. Additionally, return to sport can be as low as 45%, leaving many patients searching for further management options.

Quality assessment

The methodological quality of non‐randomized studies was evaluated using the methodological index for non‐randomized studies (MINORS) criteria. Using the items on the MINORS checklist, non‐comparative studies can achieve a maximum score of 16, while comparative studies can achieve a maximum score of 24. Non‐comparative studies were categorized a priori as follows: 0–4 indicates very low‐quality evidence, 5–7 indicates low quality, 8–12 indicates fair quality and scores ≥ 13 indicate high quality. For comparative studies, categorization was determined a priori as follows: 0–6 very low quality, 7–10 low quality, 11–15 fair quality, 16–20 good quality and ≥ 20 high quality. Quality assessment of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was conducted using the Cochrane risk‐of‐bias tool for randomized trials (RoB2) tool. Five domains are evaluated: (1) bias from the randomization process, (2) bias due to deviations from intended interventions, (3) bias due to missing outcome data, (4) bias in the measurement of the outcome and (5) bias in the selection of the reported result. Each domain is categorized as either (1) low risk of bias, (2) some concerns or (3) high risk of bias. The overall risk of bias was considered to be 'low risk' for studies assessed to be at low risk of bias in all domains, 'some concerns' if the study raised some concerns in at least one domain and 'high risk' if the study was judged to be a high risk of bias in at least one domain, or if the study raised some concerns in multiple domains. The quality assessment was performed in duplicate and the average calculated score was reported.

Data abstraction

Data were extracted in an electronic spreadsheet designed a priori (Google Sheets; Google LLC). Extracted data included study characteristics (e.g. author(s), year of publication and level of evidence) and demographic data (e.g. number of patients, patient age and sex), follow‐up time and number lost to follow‐up. Knee details were also recorded (e.g. presence of loose bodies, trochlear dysplasia and Insall–Salvati score). The type of treatment given (surgical vs. conservative) was also included in the extraction.

### Patellar maltracking: an update on the diagnosis and treatment strategies [^cfb03c69]. Insights Into Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

Patellar maltracking occurs as a result of an imbalance in the dynamic relationship between the patella and trochlea. This is often secondary to an underlying structural abnormality. The clinical evaluation can provide useful clues for the presence of such entity; however, the diagnosis can often be challenging especially in the absence of a documented history of patellar dislocation. Imaging, particularly MRI, can detect subtle features that could lead to the diagnosis, probably even more importantly when there is no clear history of patellar dislocation or before its development. This can provide a road map for formulating a treatment strategy that would be primarily aimed at stabilizing the patellofemoral joint to halt or slow the progression of articular cartilage loss. The purpose of this article is to discuss the clinical and radiologic evaluation of patellar maltracking providing an update on the cross-sectional imaging assessment and also a synopsis of the management options.

### Treatment of patellar tendinopathy – a systematic review of randomized controlled trials [^64f55c82]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

Patellar tendinopathy is a common, painful, overuse disorder. Although many different treatment methods have been described, there is no consensus regarding the optimal treatment for this condition. The purpose of this study was to systematically review, summarize, and compare treatments for patellar tendinopathy from published randomized controlled trials.

Methods

Database searches were performed for randomized prospective controlled trials comparing treatment methods for patellar tendinopathy. The thirteen articles considered relevant were scrutinized according to quality assessment guidelines and levels of evidence.

Results

Strong evidence was found for the use of eccentric training to treat patellar tendinopathy. Moderate evidence was found for conservative treatment (heavy slow resistance training) as an alternative to eccentric training. Moderate evidence suggests that low-intensity pulsed ultrasound treatment did not influence treatment outcomes. Limited evidence was found for surgery, sclerosing injections, and shockwave therapy.

Conclusion

Physical training, and particularly eccentric training, appears to be the treatment of choice for patients suffering from patellar tendinopathy. However, type of exercise, frequency, load, and dosage must also be analyzed. Other treatment methods, such as surgical treatment, sclerosing injections, and shockwave therapy, must be investigated further before recommendations can be made regarding their use. Ultrasound can likely be excluded as a treatment for patellar tendinopathy. There is a persistent lack of well-designed studies with sufficiently long-term follow-up and number of patients to draw strong conclusions regarding therapy.

### Patellar maltracking: an update on the diagnosis and treatment strategies [^246237d7]. Insights Into Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Patellar tracking refers to the dynamic relationship between the patella and trochlea during knee motion. Patellar maltracking occurs as a result of imbalance of this relationship often secondary to anatomic morphologic abnormality. Usually, young individuals, particularly women, suffer the consequences of this disorder. It is a recognized cause of anterior pain and in extreme cases presents as acute and often recurrent patellar dislocation, which is usually transient. Early diagnosis is essential, as chronic maltracking will lead to patellofemoral cartilage damage and osteoarthritis. Imaging, particularly MRI, plays a vital role in the assessment of patellar maltracking. It can not only detect any underlying morphological risk factors but also look for structural damage associated with maltracking including patellofemoral articular cartilage loss, osteochondral defects, or damage to the medial patellar stabilizers. The purpose of this article is to discuss the evaluation of patellar maltracking providing an update on the imaging assessment and also a synopsis on the management options.

### Acute patellar tendon ruptures: an update on management [^e20d20ad]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Patellar tendon rupture can be a devastating injury if not managed properly. Partial tears can often be managed successfully with temporary immobilization in extension, followed by progressive rehabilitation. Surgical repair is the mainstay of treatment of complete ruptures and can involve a variety of techniques. Suture anchor fixation and augmentation strategies are growing in popularity and have demonstrated favorable biomechanical results when compared with bone tunnels alone. However, any clinical benefit of these techniques remains unknown. The ideal rehabilitation strategy remains in question although early range of motion protocols appear to be safe and effective. Although professional athletes may have their careers shortened as a result of patellar tendon tears, return to activity in the general population remains high.

### UK defence rehabilitation consensus agreement for the conservative management of achilles and patellar tendinopathy: a modified Delphi approach [^0cc7cc11]. BMJ Military Health (2025). High credibility.

Achilles and patellar tendinopathy are common in military personnel due to the repetitive high loads and challenging extrinsic risk factors associated with the demands of their role. Sports medicine is rapidly evolving. Up-to-date evidence-based research is essential, alongside clinical reasoning, to deliver best-practice treatment to service personnel, underpinned by the duty of care to their long-term career. The aim of this research was to develop recommendations on conservative management of Achilles and patellar tendinopathy in relation to the military population. A systematic review was conducted by a multidisciplinary clinical panel from across Defence Rehabilitation. The panel was split into four subgroups (diagnosis and outcome measures, medical, exercise and adjuncts). Each subgroup proposed recommendations for voting across the wider authorship in a modified Delphi process. 28 recommendations achieved substantial agreement following a chaired meeting attended by all authors. A summary infographic was produced to highlight themes relevant to the military patient population. Diagnosis of Achilles and patellar tendinopathy remains clinical. The consensus panel strongly advocates exercise rehabilitation as the primary management of Achilles and patellar tendinopathy. Medical interventions should respect the long-term occupational needs of the military population. Education is advised, but further adjunctive interventions should only be considered on a case-by-case basis. This consensus agreement provides a framework for the development of local guidelines for the management of Achilles and patellar tendinopathy in the UK military population.

### Management of patellar tendinopathy: a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised studies [^8cc820c0]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2021). High credibility.

The effectiveness of ESWT for the treatment of patellar tendinopathy appears to be limited. Our two included RCTs comparing combined treatment with eccentric exercise and either ESWT or sham ESWT showed no short-term benefits of the former compared with the latter when short-term results were pooled (5.27). One of these studies (low overall risk of bias) reporting mid-term results did not demonstrate any superiority of ESWT versus sham ESWT for either pain or VISA-P. A further study with a low overall risk of bias compared ESWT with sham ESWT without exercise agreed with the above findings, showing no benefits of the former in the short term or mid-term for pain or VISA-P. In contrast, a single session of ESWT had favourable outcomes for VISA compared with 'conservative treatments' that included analgesia, patellar strap, eccentric exercise, physiotherapy (massage, phonophoresis, cold packs) and activity modification. However, this study had a high overall risk of bias, with results only having been reported 'before and after treatment' and not at prespecified time points. In a systematic review, Mani-Babu et al showed limited benefits of ESWT when compared with conservative interventions on patellar tendinopathy. Similarly, the review by Korakakis et al concluded that moderate strength evidence suggests that ESWT is no better than placebo ESWT. Finally, no benefits of ESWT were found compared with sham treatment for patellar tendinopathy in the short term or mid-term/long term in the review by Mendonca et al. Based on our findings and those of previous systematic reviews, we recommend that ESWT should not be used to treat patellar tendinopathy.

### 2016 patellofemoral pain consensus statement from the 4th international patellofemoral pain research retreat, manchester. part 2: recommended physical interventions (exercise, taping, bracing, foot orthoses and combined interventions) [^6addbeb7]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Patellar taping

Whether patellar taping should be first-line treatment for patellofemoral pain was unclear to this expert panel. This conclusion was consistent with the 'Best Practice Guide'findings. Patellar taping approaches vary considerably with respect to the type and duration of taping, and the systematic reviewsthat synthesise these studies have dealt with the variability inconsistently. Lack of clarity from systematic reviews may partially explain the uncertainty around the consensus voting and associated recommendations to support patellar taping.

Uncertainty around the recommendations for taping might also reflect that greater consideration of individual patient needs may be required. For example, in Barton et al 'ssynthesis, the experts described that targeting the taping to suit individual patient presentations was an important consideration. Patellar taping and bracing could play a role in patellofemoral pain management in combination with other treatments (ie, as part of a combined intervention as described above), but their role in isolation is yet to be fully determined. Other adjunctive treatments, such as joint mobilisations (patella, knee, lumbar), and electrophysical agents were not recommended for use in patellofemoral pain.

Tendinopathy

Background: Tendinopathy is characterized by pain and dysfunction in a tendon, commonly due to excessive load or strain. In active patients and athletes, overuse can lead to chronicity. The most common tendinopathy in the knee is of the patellar tendon, is colloquially known as "jumper's knee" since it is commonly seen in jumping athletes, and can lead to microtears at the tendon insertion at the distal pole.
Diagnostic criteria: Diagnosis is based on history and physical exam. Patients with patellar tendinopathy present with anterior knee pain that is worse with activity, tenderness to palpation at the inferior pole of the patella. Other tendinopathies present with tenderness to palpation and pain at the tendon insertion site with activation of the muscle. Radiologic imaging will be normal. Ultrasound can assist in confirming diagnosis and will show loss of the normal fibrillar pattern, increased spacing between fibrillar lines, and generally reduced echogenicity.MRI will show increased signal at the tendon insertion.
Treatment: Pain secondary to tendinopathy is treated symptomatically in the acute phase – this includes NSAIDs and physical therapy with a progressive loading program. Additional adjuncts for pain control such as cryotherapy, peritendinous injection with corticosteroids or platelet-rich plasma (PRP), and extracorporeal shockwave therapy can be considered if the pain fails to respond to NSAIDs and PT and/or the pain persists beyond the acute phase. Ultrasound-guided needle tenotomy, percutaneous needle scraping, and high volume injection, and stem cells are at the forefront of regenerative medicine for tendinopathy and are currently being evaluated. If non-invasive management fails, surgical intervention would be the next step.

### Review for the generalist: evaluation of anterior knee pain [^bb366f65]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Bursitis

There are multiple bursas around the knee. Bursa are synovial lined structures that provide a low-friction interface between tissues to provide smooth motion. Bursitis, inflammation of the bursa, can be secondary to repetitive microtrauma from overuse, direct trauma, autoimmune disease including juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), or infection. Prepatellar bursitis is the most common bursitis of the knee, presenting with anterior knee pain and swelling. Infrapatellar bursitis may also cause anterior knee pain mimicking patellar tendinopathy but can be diagnosed by careful palpation for localized tenderness. In both conditions it is important to differentiate fluid in the bursa from intraarticular effusion. Treatment includes local cryotherapy, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAID's) and avoidance of further direct trauma to the bursa. If there are any signs of septic bursitis the bursa should be aspirated and appropriate antibiotics prescribed.

Inflammatory disorders

Oligoarticular JIA often presents with monoarticular knee arthritis. Children may present with anterior knee pain but the typical history of morning stiffness, gradual resolution of pain with activity and clinical exam findings usually allow the practitioner to make the correct diagnosis. A complete joint and systemic examination to exclude other joint involvement is important as is screening for asymptomatic uveitis associated with JIA.

The JIA subtype, Enthesitis Related Arthritis, is unique in that it is more common in school-age boys, is frequently associated with the genetic marker HLA-B27 and inflammation of the entheses may be a prominent finding. Enthesitis (inflammation at the attachment of tendons, ligaments and fascia to bone with characteristic pain on palpation) around the knee may be confused with Osgood's Schlatter or Sinding-Larsen Johannsen disease. Enthesitis is usually associated with arthritis and symptoms are more prominent in the morning, which helps to differentiate it from the osteochondroses and traction apophysitis group.

Treatment of arthritis includes physiotherapy for improving range of motion and strength, NSAID's and potentially local intra-articular corticosteroid injection or disease modifying anti-rheumatic therapy. All children and adolescents suspected of having JIA or other chronic inflammatory arthritis should be referred to a pediatric rheumatologist.

Patellar dislocation occurs when the patella disengages completely from the trochlear (femoral) groove. Following reduction of the dislocation, conservative rehabilitation with physiotherapy may be used. Since recurrence of dislocation is common, some surgeons have advocated surgical intervention in addition to rehabilitation.

Objectives

The purpose of this review was to assess the clinical and radiological outcomes of surgical, compared with non-surgical, interventions for treating people with primary or recurrent patellar dislocation.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group's Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, EMBASE, AMED, CINAHL, ZETOC, Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro), and a variety of other literature databases and trial registries. Corresponding authors were contacted to identify additional studies. Date searched: August 2010.

Selection Criteria

Eligible for inclusion were randomised and quasi-randomised controlled clinical trials evaluating surgical versus non-surgical interventions for treating lateral patellar dislocation.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently examined titles and abstracts of each identified study to assess study eligibility, extract data and assess risk of bias. Primary outcomes assessed were the frequency of recurrent dislocation, and validated patient-rated knee or physical function scores. When appropriate, data were pooled. Risk ratios were calculated for dichotomous outcomes, and mean differences for continuous outcomes.

Main Results

Five studies (339 participants) were included. All studies had methodological shortcomings, especially the two quasi-randomised trials that presented a high risk for selection bias. Follow-up was a minimum of two years in two studies and between five and seven years in three studies. There was no significant difference between surgical and non-surgical management of primary (first-time) patellar dislocation in the risk of recurrent dislocation (47/182 versus 53/157; risk ratio 0.81, 95% confidence interval 0.56 to 1.17; 5 trials), Kujala patellofemoral disorder scores (mean difference 3.13, 95% confidence interval -7.34 to 13.59; 5 trials) nor the requirement for subsequent surgery (risk ratio 1.09, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.65; 3 trials). Adverse events were reported by one trial, citing four major complications that occurred in the surgical group. No randomised controlled trials have assessed populations with recurrent patellar dislocation.

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient high quality evidence to confirm any significant difference in outcome between surgical or non-surgical initial management of people following primary patellar dislocation, and none examining this comparison in people with recurrent patellar dislocation. Adequately powered randomised, multi-centre controlled trials, conducted and reported to contemporary standards are recommended.

RESULTS

Patient perspective

Fifty‐two patients with PFP and PF responded to the NPF survey (Table 2). Thirty‐eight participants, comprising 73% of the total, were women. Thirty‐nine (75%) participants reported experiencing anterior knee pain for more than 12 months. Not all treatment options were offered to all patients. Notably, not all patients exercise therapy mentioned as a (first) treatment option. Furthermore, 12 (40%) patients with PFP reported dissatisfaction with the results of exercise therapy, and among these, three (25%) patients reported an increase in knee pain.

Figure 6
Image illustrating patellar tendon repair using suture tendon repair augmented by semitendinosus autograft.

Internal bracing treatment is another method for acute patellar tendon repair. This technique uses high strength suture tape and knotless anchors to provide biomechanical stability of the repaired tendon. A modified technique has also been described using bone tunnels in the patella and cortical buttons on the tibia with suture tape whipstitched through the tendon. Enhanced fixation, immediate postoperative mobilization, and early functional recovery are reported benefits of internal bracing treatment techniques.

Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and the application of engineered tissue are more recently evaluated techniques to improve patellar tendon tissue regeneration and functionality in the instance of tendon injury. In 2012, Almeida et alshowed that PRP had a beneficial effect on patellar tendon healing and pain postoperatively after harvest for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. Since this time there have been several studies and systematic reviews that have demonstrated mixed results regarding the use of PRP for patellar tendinopathy. In the acute tear setting, it remains unknown if PRP offers any benefit. However, a case in which rupture occurred after PRP use for chronic tendinopathy has been reported. Additional studies will contribute to understanding the role and expectations of PRP in the management of acute patellar tendon tears. Collagen and fibrin gel scaffolds have also been reported as treatment options and have nearly replicated the native tendon tensile strength. However, long-term clinical outcomes of synthetic scaffolds have exhibited high rates of implant rupture and synovitis. To date, tissue scaffolds and biomaterials remain unable to fulfill the complex physical, mechanical, and morphological requirements of native tendons.

### Surgical versus non-surgical interventions for treating patellar dislocation [^f27562f8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Patellar dislocation occurs when the patella disengages completely from the trochlear (femoral) groove. Following reduction of the dislocation, conservative (non-surgical) rehabilitation with physiotherapy may be used. Since recurrence of dislocation is common, some surgeons have advocated surgical intervention rather than non-surgical interventions. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2011.

Objectives

To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of surgical versus non-surgical interventions for treating people with primary or recurrent patellar dislocation.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group's Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, EMBASE, AMED, CINAHL, ZETOC, Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) and a variety of other literature databases and trial registries. Corresponding authors were contacted to identify additional studies. The last search was carried out in October 2014.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised and quasi-randomised controlled clinical trials evaluating surgical versus non-surgical interventions for treating lateral patellar dislocation.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently examined titles and abstracts of each identified study to assess study eligibility, extract data and assess risk of bias. The primary outcomes we assessed were the frequency of recurrent dislocation, and validated patient-rated knee or physical function scores. We calculated risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences MD) for continuous outcomes. When appropriate, we pooled data.

Main Results

We included five randomised studies and one quasi-randomised study. These recruited a total of 344 people with primary (first-time) patellar dislocation. The mean ages in the individual studies ranged from 19.3 to 25.7 years, with four studies including children, mainly adolescents, as well as adults. Follow-up for the full study populations ranged from two to nine years across the six studies. The quality of the evidence is very low as assessed by GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation Working Group) criteria, with all studies being at high risk of performance and detection biases, relating to the lack of blinding. There was very low quality but consistent evidence that participants managed surgically had a significantly lower risk of recurrent dislocation following primary patellar dislocation at two to five years follow-up (21/162 versus 32/136; RR 0.53 favouring surgery, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.33 to 0.87; five studies, 294 participants). Based on an illustrative risk of recurrent dislocation in 222 people per 1000 in the non-surgical group, these data equate to 104 fewer (95% CI 149 fewer to 28 fewer) people per 1000 having recurrent dislocation after surgery. Similarly, there is evidence of a lower risk of recurrent dislocation after surgery at six to nine years (RR 0.67 favouring surgery, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.08; two studies, 165 participants), but a small increase cannot be ruled out. Based on an illustrative risk of recurrent dislocation in 336 people per 1000 in the non-surgical group, these data equate to 110 fewer (95% CI 195 fewer to 27 more) people per 1000 having recurrent dislocation after surgery. The very low quality evidence available from single trials only for four validated patient-rated knee and physical function scores (the Tegner activity scale, KOOS, Lysholm and Hughston VAS (visual analogue scale) score) did not show significant differences between the two treatment groups. The results for the Kujala patellofemoral disorders score (0 to 100: best outcome) differed in direction of effect at two to five years follow-up, which favoured the surgery group (MD 13.93 points higher, 95% CI 5.33 points higher to 22.53 points higher; four studies, 171 participants) and the six to nine years follow-up, which favoured the non-surgical treatment group (MD 3.25 points lower, 95% CI 10.61 points lower to 4.11 points higher; two studies, 167 participants). However, only the two to five years follow-up included the clear possibility of a clinically important effect (putative minimal clinically important difference for this outcome is 10 points). Adverse effects of treatment were reported in one trial only; all four major complications were attributed to the surgical treatment group. Slightly more people in the surgery group had subsequent surgery six to nine years after their primary dislocation (20/87 versus 16/78; RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.89, two studies, 165 participants). Based on an illustrative risk of subsequent surgery in 186 people per 1000 in the non-surgical group, these data equate to 11 more (95% CI 76 fewer to 171 more) people per 1000 having subsequent surgery after primary surgery.

Authors' Conclusions

Although there is some evidence to support surgical over non-surgical management of primary patellar dislocation in the short term, the quality of this evidence is very low because of the high risk of bias and the imprecision in the effect estimates. We are therefore very uncertain about the estimate of effect. No trials examined people with recurrent patellar dislocation. Adequately powered, multi-centre, randomised controlled trials, conducted and reported to contemporary standards, are needed. To inform the design and conduct of these trials, expert consensus should be achieved on the minimal description of both surgical and non-surgical interventions, and the anatomical or pathological variations that may be relevant to both choice of these interventions and the natural history of patellar instability. Furthermore, well-designed studies recording adverse events and long-term outcomes are needed.

### Dutch Multidisciplinary Guideline on anterior knee pain: patellofemoral pain and patellar tendinopathy [^56940133]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Although the certainty of the evidence regarding exercise therapy for the treatment of PFP and PT had to be downgraded due to risk of bias (study limitations), imprecision (number of included patients) or heterogeneity (inconsistencies), the expert panel advocates for the use of exercise therapy as the primary treatment strategy. This finding is consistent with recent consensus statements and clinical practice guidelines. The expert panel aimed to inform more healthcare providers, as well as patients with PFP or PT, of the value of exercise therapy as the first choice for treatment.

Because most of the included studies did not describe all exercise therapy parameters, reproducibility of the exact treatment protocols and optimal treatment in clinical practice is arduous. One‐quarter of the PFP respondents who reported dissatisfaction with the results of exercise therapy reported an increase in knee pain. Remarkably, only one RCT in patients with PFP stated explicitly that 'no self‐reported increase in usual pain after the training session or the next morning' is allowed. For patients with PT, pain during or after exercise therapy was better covered in the included RCTs.

### Operative versus non-operative management of patellar dislocation. A meta-analysis [^dd7e8980]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

Conservative management of patellar dislocation can result in recurrent instability in up to 60% of patients. Surgery is therefore advocated in an attempt to reduce the incidence of recurrent dislocation and instability. The purpose of this study was to compare the clinical outcomes of operative to non-operative treatment strategies for patients following patellar dislocation.

Methods

A systematic review of published and unpublished literature was undertaken. Following data extraction, a meta-analysis was conducted to compare the two treatment strategies. The methodological quality of the literature was assessed using the PEDro critical appraisal tool.

Results

Eleven studies were included, five randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and six non-RCTs. These assessed 403 patients managed conservatively, compared to 344 managed surgically. The findings of this study indicate that operative management of patellar dislocation is associated with a significantly higher risk of patellofemoral joint osteoarthritis (P = 0.04), but a significantly lower risk of subsequent patellar dislocation compared to non-surgical management (P < 0.01).

Conclusions

The meta-analysis indicates that there may be a difference in the incidence of patellofemoral joint osteoarthritis and rate of subsequent dislocation. However, this finding should currently be interpreted with great caution due to the demonstration of statistically significant publication bias, issues related to the methodological quality of the evidence base, and due to the variety of different surgical interventions currently presented within the literature.

### Management of the deficient patella in revision total knee arthroplasty [^2a442033]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2008). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

There are a number of options available to manage the patella when revising a failed total knee arthroplasty. If the previous patellar component is well-fixed, undamaged, not worn, and compatible with the femoral revision component, then it can be retained. When a patellar component necessitates revision and is removed with adequate remaining patellar bone stock, an onlay-type all-polyethylene cemented implant can be used. Management of the patella with severe bony deficiency remains controversial. Treatment options for the severely deficient patella include the use of a cemented all-polyethylene biconvex patellar prosthesis, patellar bone grafting and augmentation, patellar resection arthroplasty (patelloplasty), performing a gull-wing osteotomy, patellectomy, or the use of newer technology such as a tantalum (trabecular metal) patellar prosthesis. Severe patellar bone deficiency is a challenging situation because restoration of the extensor mechanism, proper patellar tracking, and satisfactory anatomic relationships with the femoral and tibial components are critical for an optimal clinical outcome.

### Evidence-based clinical practice guidelines on regenerative medicine treatment for chronic pain: a consensus report from a multispecialty working group [^acc4ca7a]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Patellar Tendinitis

There are few, low-quality studies investigating injectable biologics for patellar tendinitis. A review highlighted best practices in patellar tendinopathy treatment, suggesting that PRP may not provide additional benefit beyond conventional therapy. Studies suggest that this may be due to lack of consistent methodology on dose, frequency, and timing coupled with variable patient selection criteria. Two small studies report the use of MSCs in patellar tendinopathy. Pascual-Garrido et al treated eight patients and reported high patient satisfaction with the treatment at five years. Conversely, Rodas et al failed to demonstrate the superiority of MSCs compared to PRP treatment, although it should be noted that both arms had improvements in reported pain and function scores.

Consensus Point 11. There is inconsistent and conflicting evidence from low-quality studies on the use of PRP and injectable biologics for the treatment of patellar tendinopathy. Our appraisal suggests that injectable biologics are not recommended as an adjunct to conventional therapy (Level II-3, Grade D).

### Surgical management of first-time patellar dislocations in paediatric patients may lower rates of redislocation compared to conservative management: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^9baabcfb]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Purpose

The purpose of this study is to assess whether early surgical intervention for first‐time patellar dislocations in paediatric patients is superior to conservative management. We hypothesized that surgical intervention would lead to lower redislocation rates compared to conservative treatment.

Methods

Three online databases (PubMed, MEDLINE and EMBASE) were searched from inception to 14 March 2024 to identify studies investigating the management options for acute first‐time patellar dislocations in paediatric patients. Data pertaining to patient demographics, patient management, redislocation rates and Kujala scores, evaluating function, were abstracted. Weighted means and meta‐analyses were conducted to compare rates of redislocation, as well as Kujala scores. The quality of included studies was assessed using the methodological index for non‐randomized studies criteria for non‐randomized studies and the ROB2 tool for randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

Results

A total of 11 studies and 761 patients were included in this review. The weighted mean post‐operative combined rates of redislocation in the surgical group was 25.1%, compared to 46.4% in the conservative group at a mean follow‐up of 53.2 months (12–168). The relative risk (RR) of redislocation was 0.82 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.65‐1.04, I² = 0%, p = 0.11), favouring surgery compared to conservative management. A subgroup meta‐analysis of two recent RCTs with 110 patients demonstrated an RR of redislocation of 0.53 (95% CI: 0.31–0.91, I² = 0%, p = 0.02), favouring surgery. Kujala scores among three comparative studies showed a mean difference of −2.7 (95% CI: −6.1 to 0.68, I² = 0%, p = 0.12), favouring conservative treatment. The weighted mean redislocation rate in 131 patients undergoing medial patellofemoral ligament reconstruction (MPFLR) was 3.1%, compared to 39.4% in 203 patients undergoing other surgical procedures, such as lateral release and medial imbrication, Roux‐Goldwaith and MPFL repair. Furthermore, the conservative groups experienced a complication rate of 0.9% compared to 2.9% across the surgical groups.

Conclusion

Surgical management for first‐time patellar dislocations in a paediatric population, particularly MPFLR, may be more beneficial in lowering redislocation rates than conservative management. No significant differences in Kujala scores were found.

Surgical management

Surgical management of patellar instability should be guided on an individual patient basis depending on history, physical examination, and radiologic findings as outlined above. Over 100 different procedures have been described for the treatment of patellar instability, and this reflects the various causes for instability and lack of current gold standard. The most accepted indication for surgical management of patellar instability is the presence of a large displaced osteochondral fracture or loose body.

Surgical management procedures can broadly be categorized as soft tissue procedures (lateral release, medial imbrication, and MPFL repair or reconstruction) and bony procedures (tibial tubercle transfer procedures and trochleoplasty).

Soft tissue procedures are designed to repair or tighten stretched and injured soft tissues contributing to patellar stability. They are best indicated in isolation in the setting of recurrent instability with minimal underlying osseous malalignment (normal TT-TG, minimal trochlear dysplasia). Lateral release and medial imbrication on their own are generally insufficient, but can be used to augment an MPFL repair or reconstruction or, if there is osseous misalignment, used in conjunction with a bony procedure particularly if there is recurrent instability or demonstrable lateral patellar tilt. Reconstruction of the MPFL has recently become an increasingly popular procedure for recurrent lateral patellar instability. The technique has been refined, and a better understanding of the anatomical features of both the origin and insertion of the ligament onto the patella has made the operation more reproducible (Fig. 9). Despite this, there remains considerable variation in surgical technique including graft choice, position, and tension making the literature difficult to compare.

Primary elective total knee arthroplasty (TKA) patellar management — Outcome importance includes reoperation, long term anterior knee pain, and patient satisfaction. Cost effectiveness/resource utilization notes that an unsurfaced patella poses the benefits of a faster surgery, avoiding potential complications of patellar resurfacing, and decreased cost compared to resurfacing, but these potential benefits need to be balanced against the potential risk of requiring resurfacing at a later date and revision rates. Acceptability states that literature is conflicted; provider-preference based patellar management should be acceptable to medical providers, and this recommendation applies to primary knee arthroplasty; physicians should exercise caution based on anatomic and bone-stock variability among patients as well as the patient-specific activity level, age and risk of future revision. Feasibility indicates there are no significant barriers to implementation and that elimination of patellar resurfacing may reduce operative time, blood loss and additional expenses. Potential harms listed include "patellar fracture, avascular necrosis, and extensor mechanism violation, which may be catastrophic in the setting of primary elective TKA". Future research calls for large multicenter prospective RCT or cohort studies to assess indications for selective patellar resurfacing.

### Osteoarthritis management: updated guidelines from the American… [^6a2e5e41]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- Weight loss, exercise, tai chi, and patient-directed activity programs can improve pain and function in knee and hip OA.
- In knee and hip OA, intra-articular corticosteroid injections and oral and topical NSAIDs improve pain and function only over the short term.
- Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, immunomodulators, glucosamine, and biologic injection therapies should be avoided in OA. Recommended Treatments NONPHARMACOLOGIC The guideline recommends exercise, tai chi, and self-efficacy or self-management programs as first-line treatments. Exercise and tai chi slightly improve pain and function in knee and hip OA. No particular exercise is superior, although most studies used aerobic exercise. The benefit from tai chi lasts for at least 24 weeks, whereas exercise is beneficial for up to one year. Pain in OA is related to weight, and even a 5% weight loss provides notable improvement in knee and hip pain.

Patient-directed activities, such as using activity trackers, online modules, cognitive behavior therapy, and goal setting consistently demonstrate small improvements in function and pain. A few treatments are effective for OA in specific joints. For knee OA, tibiofemoral knee braces reduce pain and improve walking speed. Hand orthoses appear to improve pain and function for OA in the first carpometacarpal joint. Treatments with Conditional Recommendations CONDITIONALLY RECOMMENDED Acupuncture and thermal interventions should be considered for small improvements in pain and function for up to one year. Balance training with or without strength training reduces pain from lower extremity OA. Cognitive behavior therapy is also beneficial for pain control. In select patients who do not experience adverse effects, prescribing tramadol, acetaminophen, or duloxetine may provide short-term pain relief from OA.

CONDITIONALLY RECOMMENDED AGAINST The use of modified shoes, lateral and medial wedge orthotics, and manual therapies provides little relief for knee and hip OA. Nontramadol opioids should be avoided in the treatment of OA, given the high risk of toxicity and dependency. Although colchicine, fish oil, and vitamin D for hip, knee, and hand OA have little to no harmful effects, there is insufficient benefit to consider their use. Prolotherapy and intra-articular botulinum toxin injections for knee and hip OA are conditionally not recommended because of the lack of effectiveness in a small number of trials.

### Surgical versus non-surgical interventions for treating patellar dislocation [^d1fed940]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Patellar (knee cap) dislocation occurs when the patella disengages completely from the trochlear (femoral) groove. It affects up to 42/100,000 people, and is most prevalent in those aged 20 to 30 years old. It is uncertain whether surgical or non-surgical treatment is the best approach. This is important as recurrent dislocation occurs in up to 40% of people who experience a first time (primary) dislocation. This can reduce quality of life and as a result people have to modify their lifestyle. This review is needed to determine whether surgical or non-surgical treatment should be offered to people after patellar dislocation.

Objectives

To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of surgical versus non-surgical interventions for treating people with primary or recurrent patellar dislocation.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group's Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, AMED, CINAHL, Physiotherapy Evidence Database and trial registries in December 2021. We contacted corresponding authors to identify additional studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised and quasi-randomised controlled clinical trials evaluating surgical versus non-surgical interventions for treating primary or recurrent lateral patellar dislocation in adults or children.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were recurrent patellar dislocation, and patient-rated knee and physical function scores. Our secondary outcomes were health-related quality of life, return to former activities, knee pain during activity or at rest, adverse events, patient-reported satisfaction, patient-reported knee instability symptoms and subsequent requirement for knee surgery. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome.

Main Results

We included 10 studies (eight randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and two quasi-RCTs) of 519 participants with patellar dislocation. The mean ages in the individual studies ranged from 13.0 to 27.2 years. Four studies included children, mainly adolescents, as well as adults; two only recruited children. Study follow-up ranged from one to 14 years. We are unsure of the evidence for all outcomes in this review because we judged the certainty of the evidence to be very low. We downgraded each outcome by three levels. Reasons included imprecision (when fewer than 100 events were reported or the confidence interval (CI) indicated appreciable benefits as well as harms), risk of bias (when studies were at high risk of performance, detection and attrition bias), and inconsistency (in the event that pooled analysis included high levels of statistical heterogeneity). We are uncertain whether surgery lowers the risk of recurrent dislocation following primary patellar dislocation compared with non-surgical management at two to nine year follow-up. Based on an illustrative risk of recurrent dislocation in 348 people per 1000 in the non-surgical group, we found that 157 fewer people per 1000 (95% CI 209 fewer to 87 fewer) had recurrent dislocation between two and nine years after surgery (8 studies, 438 participants). We are uncertain whether surgery improves patient-rated knee and function scores. Studies measured this outcome using different scales (the Tegner activity scale, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, Lysholm, Kujala Patellofemoral Disorders score and Hughston visual analogue scale). The most frequently reported score was the Kujala Patellofemoral Disorders score. This indicated people in the surgical group had a mean score of 5.73 points higher at two to nine year follow-up (95% CI 2.91 lower to 14.37 higher; 7 studies, 401 participants). On this 100-point scale, higher scores indicate better function, and a change score of 10 points is considered to be clinically meaningful; therefore, this CI includes a possible meaningful improvement. We are uncertain whether surgery increases the risk of adverse events. Based on an assumed risk of overall incidence of complications during the first two years in 277 people out of 1000 in the non-surgical group, 335 more people per 1000 (95% CI 75 fewer to 723 more) had an adverse event in the surgery group (2 studies, 144 participants). Three studies (176 participants) assessed participant satisfaction at two to nine year follow-up, reporting little difference between groups. Based on an assumed risk of 763 per 1000 non-surgical participants reporting excellent or good outcomes, seven more participants per 1000 (95% CI 199 fewer to 237 more) reported excellent or good satisfaction. Four studies (256 participants) assessed recurrent patellar subluxation at two to nine year follow-up. Based on an assumed risk of patellar subluxation in 292 out of 1000 in the non-surgical group, 73 fewer people per 1000 (95% CI 146 fewer to 35 more) had patellar subluxation as a result of surgery. Slightly more people had subsequent surgery in the non-surgical group. Pooled two to nine year follow-up data from three trials (195 participants) indicated that, based on an assumed risk of subsequent surgery in 215 people per 1000 in the non-surgical group, 118 fewer people per 1000 (95% CI 200 fewer to 372 more) had subsequent surgery after primary surgery.

Authors' Conclusions

We are uncertain whether surgery improves outcome compared to non-surgical management as the certainty of the evidence was very low. No sufficiently powered trial has examined people with recurrent patellar dislocation. Adequately powered, multicentre, randomised trials are needed. To inform the design and conduct of these trials, expert consensus should be achieved on the minimal description of both surgical and non-surgical interventions, and the pathological variations that may be relevant to both choice of these interventions.

### Review for the generalist: evaluation of anterior knee pain [^3ba47e77]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Synovial plica

The knee has normal synovial folds that are residual embryonic remnants persisting from when the knee cavity was a septated structure. Occasionally, pathological conditions occur within the plica(e) due to local synovitis caused by acute, direct or repetitive microtrauma. The inflamed plica can become trapped between the patella and the femoral condyle. Impingement can cause further inflammation and fibrosis with abrasion of the femoral condyle, changes in the articular surface and reactive changes in the subchondral bone. Diagnosis is clinical; common complaints are of medial knee pain worsened with running, stair climbing or squatting accompanied by snapping and catching during flexion (usually flexion arc 30–70 degrees). On examination the medial patellar retinaculum from the patella to the medial femoral condyle or anteromedial joint line may be tender. The plica may be palpable as a thickened band that is tender when pressed against the edge of the condyle. Management includes patellar mobilization and massage, flexibility exercises for the hamstrings, quadriceps and gastrocnemius, and anti-inflammatory medications with surgical removal of the plica reserved for recalcitrant symptoms.

Quadriceps tendinopathy

Pain arising at the quadriceps tendon attachment to the patella is uncommon in the pediatric population. On examination there is tenderness at the superior margin of the patella and pain is exacerbated by resisted quadriceps contraction. Treatment includes local massage at the site of pain in addition to the general principles used for patellar tendinopathy.

Bipartite patella

The patella ossifies between 3 and 5 years of age with gradual coalescence of multiple ossification centers. Accessory ossification centres often occur; the most common location is the superolateral patella. A bipartite patella is usually an asymptomatic, incidental radiographic finding. Radiographs show regular smooth fragment margins with no evidence of soft tissue swelling, differentiating the lesion from acute fracture. Occasionally bipartite patella may cause anterior knee pain. Clinically there is soft tissue tenderness at the superolateral pole of the patella. Initial treatment is conservative with modified activity and local flexibility and strengthening exercises. Surgical options include excision or fixation of the bipartite patella or release of the vastus lateralis insertion.

Stress fracture of the patella

Stress fractures of the patella are rare causes of anterior knee pain. In the pediatric population, it is reported in jumping athletes who present with intense localized pain with possible overlying soft tissue swelling. Radiographs will detect chronic stress reaction; early lesions are best detected by radionucleotide bone scan.

### Structure and function, injury, pathology, and treatment of the medial collateral ligament of the knee [^40bde96c]. Emergency Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

The medial collateral ligament (MCL) is the most commonly injured ligament of the knee. There is a spectrum of injury severity, and injuries may be acute or chronic. The MCL is also frequently injured in conjunction with other knee structures. Clinical evaluation of the knee is important to assess the degree of surgical acuity, but magnetic resonance imaging can provide details about the injury that may not be obvious clinically. In addition to injury, MCL bursitis can occur and may be treated with needle aspiration and corticosteroid injection. This review article covers the anatomy and biomechanics of the MCL, its injury patterns and approach to management, and MCL bursitis.

### Lateral patellar instability in the skeletally mature patient: evaluation and surgical management [^37e597a9]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2018). Low credibility.

Lateral patellar instability is a common disease process that affects all types of patients. Depending on the patient's anatomy and the results of preoperative imaging, surgical management options include medial patellofemoral ligament reconstruction, tibial tubercle osteotomy, and sulcus-deepening trochleoplasty. Medial patellofemoral ligament reconstruction or repair is useful for almost all patients, whereas tibial tubercle osteotomy is helpful to correct a lateralized tibial tubercle and the associated elevated lateral pull of the extensor mechanism. For a select subset of patients with severe trochlear dysplasia, a sulcus-deepening trochleoplasty can be a useful option to prevent future patellar instability. Many technical considerations exist for each procedure, and in most situations, no consensus exists to direct surgeons on the superior technique.

### Exercise therapy for patellofemoral pain syndrome [^f51e4b17]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS) is a common problem among adolescents and young adults, characterised by retropatellar pain (behind the kneecap) or peripatellar pain (around the kneecap) when ascending or descending stairs, squatting or sitting with flexed knees. Etiology, structures causing the pain and treatment methods are all debated in literature, but consensus has not been reached so far. Exercise therapy to strengthen the quadriceps is often prescribed, though its efficacy is still debated.

Objectives

This review aims to summarise the evidence of effectiveness of exercise therapy in reducing anterior knee pain and improving knee function in patients with PFPS.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Musculoskeletal Injuries Group and Cochrane Rehabilitation and Related Therapies Field specialised registers, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, PEDro - The Physiotherapy Evidence Database, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, up till December 2001 for controlled trials (randomised or not) comparing exercise therapy with control groups, or comparing different types of exercise therapy.

Selection Criteria

Only trials focusing on exercise therapy in patients with PFPS were considered. Trials in patients with other diagnoses such as tendinitis, Osgood Schlatter syndrome, bursitis, traumatic injuries, osteoarthritis, plica syndrome, Sinding-Larssen-Johansson syndrome and patellar luxations were excluded.

Data Collection and Analysis

From 750 publications 12 trials were selected. All included trials studied quadriceps strengthening exercises. Outcome assessments for knee pain and knee function in daily life were used in a best evidence synthesis to summarise evidence for effectiveness.

Main Results

One high and two low quality studies used a control group not receiving exercise therapy. Significantly greater pain reduction in the exercise groups was found in one high and one low quality study, though at different time points. Only one low quality study reported significantly greater functional improvement with exercise. Five studies compared exercise therapies that could be designated closed kinetic chain exercise (foot in contact with a surface) versus open kinetic chain exercise (foot not in contact with a surface). Two of these studies were of high quality, but no significant differences in improvement of function or reduction of pain were apparent between the types of exercise in any of the studies. The remaining four studies, all of which were of low quality, focused on other treatment comparisons.

Reviewer's Conclusions

The evidence that exercise therapy is more effective in treating PFPS than no exercise was limited with respect to pain reduction, and conflicting with respect to functional improvement. There is strong evidence that open and closed kinetic chain exercise are equally effective. Further research to substantiate the efficacy of exercise treatment compared to a non-exercising control group is needed, and thorough consideration should be given to methodological aspects of study design and reporting.

### The 'best practice guide to conservative management of patellofemoral pain': incorporating level 1 evidence with expert clinical reasoning [^17ca8730]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Importance

Patellofemoral pain (PFP) is both chronic and prevalent; it has complex aetiology and many conservative treatment options.

Objective

Develop a comprehensive contemporary guide to conservative management of PFP outlining key considerations for clinicians to follow.

Design

Mixed methods.

Methods

We synthesised the findings from six high-quality systematic reviews to September 2013 with the opinions of 17 experts obtained via semistructured interviews. Experts had at least 5years clinical experience with PFP as a specialist focus, were actively involved in PFP research and contributed to specialist international meetings. The interviews covered clinical reasoning, perception of current evidence and research priorities.

Results

Multimodal intervention including exercise to strengthen the gluteal and quadriceps musculature, manual therapy and taping possessed the strongest evidence. Evidence also supports use of foot orthoses and acupuncture. Interview transcript analysis identified 23 themes and 58 subthemes. Four key over-arching principles to ensure effective management included-(1) PFP is a multifactorial condition requiring an individually tailored multimodal approach. (2) Immediate pain relief should be a priority to gain patient trust. (3) Patient empowerment by emphasising active over passive interventions is important. (4) Good patient education and activity modification is essential. Future research priorities include identifying risk factors, testing effective prevention, developing education strategies, evaluating the influence of psychosocial factors on treatment outcomes and how to address them, evaluating the efficacy of movement pattern retraining and improving clinicians' assessment skills to facilitate optimal individual prescription.

Conclusions and Relevance

Effective management of PFP requires consideration of a number of proven conservative interventions. An individually tailored multimodal intervention programme including gluteal and quadriceps strengthening, patellar taping and an emphasis on education and activity modification should be prescribed for patients with PFP. We provide a 'Best Practice Guide to Conservative Management of Patellofemoral Pain' outlining key considerations.

Module 8: 'Open surgery for PFP and PT'

Scoping question: What is the value of open surgery for patients with PFP and PT?

Background: When PFP and PT are unresponsive to conservative treatments, patients are sometimes referred to an orthopaedic surgeon for evaluation, confirmation of diagnosis, potential supplementary diagnostics and appraisal of indications for surgical treatment. The Dutch Guideline on Knee Arthroscopy recommends not performing arthroscopy for PFP and exercising caution in performing arthroscopy for PT. However, the role of open surgery in the surgical treatment of PFP and PT remains unclear.

Evidence review: No studies have been conducted on open surgery for PFP. One systematic review of open surgery for PT was included ('low GRADE').

Rationale: Recommendations of the expert panel were based solely on clinical expertise. Imaging assessments (magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography) are obligatory and should be evaluated for post‐traumatic, degenerative, or congenital morphological causes of PFP. When open surgery for PT is indicated, the expert panel recommends magnetic resonance imaging assessment to confirm the exact location and degree of patellar tendon abnormalities before surgery.

Recommendations:

Initially, PFP and PT should only be treated with non‐operative treatments for at least 6 months (see Module 2: 'Exercise therapy for PFP', Module 3: 'Additional conservative treatments for PFP', Module 5: 'Exercise for PT' and Module 6: 'Additional conservative treatments for PT').
Surgery should only be considered when conservative treatment fails; the variable and unpredictable outcomes and potential risks of open surgery for PFP and PT should be discussed, and shared decision‐making should be employed when choosing the treatment.
Open surgery should be considered only when, following at least 6 months of non‐operative treatments, including exercise therapy, the patient continues to experience persistent and disabling symptoms and functional limitations, and o Anatomical morphology is determined to be the cause of persistent PFP confirmed by imaging assessments or o PT is confirmed by imaging assessments.

Evidence review

Regarding the eight predefined modules and scoping questions (Figure 1), a detailed description of the systematic literature search and selection strategy, as well as the assessment of the risk of bias of individual studies, can be found under 'Construction of modules' in the module section in the online Supporting Information. This guideline was developed based on the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II (AGREE II). The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) method was used to rate the certainty of the evidence (Table 1).

Table 1
GRADE classification.

The strength of the scientific evidence and the weight assigned to the considerations by the expert panel together determine the strength of the recommendations. In accordance with the GRADE method, a low GRADE value of conclusions in the systematic literature analysis does not preclude a strong recommendation a priori; weak recommendations are also possible with a high GRADE value. Moreover, the strength of a recommendation is always determined by weighing all the relevant arguments. The evidence review and study selection for each module are presented in the online Supporting Information.

Consensus process

The expert panel considered pain and function as critical outcome measures and return to sports/work, duration of absenteeism and patient satisfaction as important outcome measures for decision‐making. The expert panel met in person and online, and the panel chair (SvB) ensured that all members had equal and uninhibited votes. Every module, including the final recommendations, was discussed with all members of the expert panel to create a unanimous recommendation. During the commentary and authorization phases, the draft guideline was submitted to all medical associations involved, as well as the NPF and other relevant stakeholders. These associations provided comments that were viewed and processed by the expert panel. The final version of the guideline was approved by all involved medical associations. The literature conclusions, considerations and summaries with tables and/or figures per module are presented in the online Supporting Information.

### Clinical management of olecranon bursitis: a review [^e18115db]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Olecranon bursitis is a disease characterized by inflammation of the olecranon bursa, most often due to microtrauma. Although it is a common condition, there is a lack of evidence-based recommendations for the management of nonseptic olecranon bursitis. The condition is often self-limited and resolves with conservative methods such as rest, ice, compression, orthosis wear, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications. Older studies have shown resolution of symptoms with intrabursal corticosteroid injections and surgical bursectomy. More recent literature has demonstrated adverse effects of intrabursal injections and surgery compared with noninvasive management for initial treatment of nonseptic olecranon bursitis. In order to better tailor decision-making, it is important that hand surgeons understand the comparative efficacies of each option for management of nonseptic olecranon bursitis.

### Dutch Multidisciplinary Guideline on anterior knee pain: patellofemoral pain and patellar tendinopathy [^9527fa02]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

After ruling out other clinical conditions and confirming PFP or PT as a clinical diagnosis, this guideline recommends starting with exercise therapy preferably [partly] under the supervision of a physical therapist and following this treatment for 6 (PFP) to 12 (PT) weeks. Additional conservative treatments are only indicated when exercise therapy does not result in clinically relevant changes and pain medications should be reserved for exceptional cases of severe pain. The additional value of imaging assessments for PT is limited. Open surgery is reserved for very specific cases, which do not respond to exercise therapy or additional conservative treatments (Figure 3).

Figure 3
Evidence‐based clinical approaches for PFP and PT. Optimal treatment and timelines with exercise therapy as the cornerstone in the first 6 and 12 weeks for PFP and PT, respectively. Pain medications may play a role in this first part in cases with severe pain, with additional conservative treatments only when exercise therapy does not result in clinically relevant changes. Due to the limited additional value of imaging assessments for PT, its use should be considered only after 12 weeks. Reconsider diagnosis after 12 weeks (PFP and PT) and open surgery is reserved for very specific cases only. PFP, patellofemoral pain; PT, patellar tendinopathy.

An innovative aspect of this guideline is that criteria and explicit timelines have been established to clarify when clinically relevant changes can and should be expected. The expert panel delineated clinically relevant changes as measurable changes on accepted patient‐reported outcome measures, including a minimum of 10 points on the AKPS or 16 points on the Victorian Institute of Sport Assessment Scale‐Patella. The limited additional value of other conservative treatments, pain medications, imaging assessments and open surgery has been highlighted to support shared decision‐making. A systematic approach to making clinical practice recommendations was adopted using the AGREE II instrument and GRADE method. The process of development of this guideline revealed relevant knowledge gaps, such as the parameters of exercise therapy and the added value of additional conservative treatments, medications and open surgery. An in‐depth discussion of the results for each scoping question can be found in the online Supporting Information.

### American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons clinical practice guideline summary: management of anterior cruciate ligament injuries [^de8fac12]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2023). High credibility.

Autograft source — anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction in skeletally mature patients — states that surgeons may favor BTB to reduce the risk of graft failure or infection, or hamstring to reduce the risk of anterior or kneeling pain. Quality of Evidence: High and Strength of Recommendation: Moderate (downgraded). The recommendation was downgraded one level due to variable size of hamstring autografts, and supporting evidence includes lower graft ruptures/revision in the bone patella bone autograft compared to the others, while several have noted bone patellar bone associated with more knee pain. Surgeon and patient preference will be part of informed decision making to guide graft choice of ACL reconstruction. Outcome considerations note that graft re-tear is a very important outcome and that infection is rare but challenging complication. Cost impact is described as likely cost neutral overall with shift in fixation methods but minimal otherwise. Acceptability is high, as use of bone patellar bone and hamstring autograft are readily acceptable as part of the armamentarium of all surgeons performing ACL reconstruction. Future research should evaluate the long-term consequences and relative cost effectiveness of differing graft options, and quad tendon autograft deserves further study as an emerging option for ACL reconstruction.

### Achilles and patellar tendinopathy: current understanding of pathophysiology and management [^e9819e1d]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose

Achilles and patellar tendinopathy cause significant morbidity in professional and recreational athletes. Both the Achilles and patellar tendons are weight-bearing tendons that lack a true tendon sheath but are surrounded by paratenon.

Method

A review of the literature to outline the characteristics of tendinopathy in these two tendons, and to discuss current concepts of pathophysiology, use of imaging in the diagnosis and aid to clinical management strategies in tendinopathy.

Results

Achilles and patellar tendinopathy share common histopathology such as intratendinous failed healing response and neoangiogenesis.

Conclusion

Achilles and patellar tendinopathy cause much morbidity in the athletic and non athletic population attending sports medicine and rheumatology clinics. Tendinopathy is essentially an 'overuse', degenerative condition. Neovascularisation evident on Doppler ultrasound correlates well with pain and poor function. Peritendinous injections and eccentric training decrease neovascularity, relieve pain and improve outcome. Although surgery is the last resort in those patients failing conservative management, it is still unclear how the removal of adhesions and excision of affected tendinopathic areas affects healing and vascularity, or resolves pain.

### Management of first-time patellar dislocation: the ESSKA 2024 formal consensus-part 1 [^7df41989]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To provide recommendations for the treatment of patients with first-time patellar dislocation (FTPD). Part I focused on clinical presentation, symptoms, diagnosis, evaluation and imaging.

Methods

Fifty-four orthopaedic surgeons and one physiotherapist from 20 countries across Europe were involved in the consensus, which was the FTPD. The consensus was performed according to the European Society for Sports Traumatology, Knee Surgery and Arthroscopy consensus methodology. The steering group designed the questions and prepared the statements based on the experience of the experts and the evidence in the literature. The statements were evaluated by the ratings of the peer-review groups before a final consensus was released.

Results

The consensus consists of 32 questions and statements, 13 of which will be reviewed in Part 1 of the review. There is an inverse correlation between the intensity of trauma leading to FTPD and the underlying pathoanatomic risk factors, meaning that low trauma intensity usually indicates more severe underlying abnormalities. In addition to the clinical investigation, patient age, family history, bilateral symptoms of instability and injury mechanism should be evaluated. However, reliance can be placed not only on clinical examination but also on magnetic resonance imaging scans as soon as possible, which are considered mandatory for evaluating predisposing factors such as trochlear dysplasia and patella alta and for detecting osteochondral lesions, with the exception of asymptomatic patients. Importantly, it must be recognized that in addition to recurrent instability, which affects approximately 25% of patients, a variety of symptoms are experienced by 50% of patients, such as pain, swelling, giving way, functional and psychological limitations, and a reduction in sports participation, all of which reduce their quality of life. The complications after medial patellofemoral ligament reconstruction in patients with FTPD have not yet been established; however, we know from cohorts of heterogeneous patients that the most common complications are patellofemoral pain, a reduced range of motion and patellar fracture. In total, there were 13 statements that were all accepted and achieved, 6 with strong agreements and 7 with relative agreements. The general median agreement was 8 (range 7–9). None were graded A, two were graded B, seven were graded C and 4 were graded D.

Conclusion

In relation to the management of patients with first-time patellar luxation, we have worked with 13 questions and based on these we have achieved consensus on 13 statements.

### Evaluation of patients presenting with knee pain: part II. differential diagnosis [^2ed31357]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Knee pain is a common presenting complaint with many possible causes. An awareness of certain patterns can help the family physician identify the underlying cause more efficiently. Teenage girls and young women are more likely to have patellar tracking problems such as patellar subluxation and patellofemoral pain syndrome, whereas teenage boys and young men are more likely to have knee extensor mechanism problems such as tibial apophysitis (Osgood-Schlatter lesion) and patellar tendonitis. Referred pain resulting from hip joint pathology, such as slipped capital femoral epiphysis, also may cause knee pain. Active patients are more likely to have acute ligamentous sprains and overuse injuries such as pes anserine bursitis and medial plica syndrome. Trauma may result in acute ligamentous rupture or fracture, leading to acute knee joint swelling and hemarthrosis. Septic arthritis may develop in patients of any age, but crystal-induced inflammatory arthropathy is more likely in adults. Osteoarthritis of the knee joint is common in older adults.

### First-time traumatic patellar dislocation: a systematic review [^ab370c6a]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2007). Low credibility.

Acute patellar dislocations can result in patellar instability, pain, recurrent dislocations, decreased level of sporting activity, and patellofemoral arthritis. The initial management of a first-time traumatic patellar dislocation is controversial with no evidence-based consensus to guide decision making. Most first-time traumatic patellar dislocations have been traditionally treated nonoperatively; however, there has been a recent trend in initial surgical management. We performed a systematic review of Level I-IV studies to make evidence-based medicine recommendations on how a clinician should approach the diagnosis and treatment of a first-time traumatic dislocation. More specifically we answer the primary question of when initial treatment should consist of operative versus closed management. Based on the review of 70 articles looking at study design, mean followup, subjective and validated outcome measures, redislocation rates, and long-term symptoms, we recommend initial nonoperative management of a first-time traumatic dislocation except in several specific circumstances. These include the presence of an osteochondral fracture, substantial disruption of the medial patellar stabilizers, a laterally subluxated patella with normal alignment of the contralateral knee, or a second dislocation, or in patients not improving with appropriate rehabilitation.

### Four common types of bursitis: diagnosis and management [^8933b734]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2011). Low credibility.

Bursitis is a common cause of musculoskeletal pain and often prompts orthopaedic consultation. Bursitis must be distinguished from arthritis, fracture, tendinitis, and nerve pathology. Common types of bursitis include prepatellar, olecranon, trochanteric, and retrocalcaneal. Most patients respond to nonsurgical management, including ice, activity modification, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. In cases of septic bursitis, oral antibiotics may be administered. Local corticosteroid injection may be used in the management of prepatellar and olecranon bursitis; however, steroid injection into the retrocalcaneal bursa may adversely affect the biomechanical properties of the Achilles tendon. Surgical intervention may be required for recalcitrant bursitis, such as refractory trochanteric bursitis.

### Management of patellofemoral pain syndrome [^a2341aef]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

Patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS) is the most common cause of knee pain in the outpatient setting. It is caused by imbalances in the forces controlling patellar tracking during knee flexion and extension, particularly with overloading of the joint. Risk factors include overuse, trauma, muscle dysfunction, tight lateral restraints, patellar hypermobility, and poor quadriceps flexibility. Typical symptoms include pain behind or around the patella that is increased with running and activities that involve knee flexion. Findings in patients with PFPS range from limited patellar mobility to a hypermobile patella. To confirm the diagnosis, an examination of the knee focusing on the patella and surrounding structures is essential. For many patients with the clinical diagnosis of PFPS, imaging studies are not necessary before beginning treatment. Radiography is recommended in patients with a history of trauma or surgery, those with an effusion, those older than 50 years (to rule out osteoarthritis), and those whose pain does not improve with treatment. Recent research has shown that physical therapy is effective in treating PFPS. There is little evidence to support the routine use of knee braces or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Surgery should be considered only after failure of a comprehensive rehabilitation program. Educating patients about modification of risk factors is important in preventing recurrence.

Methods

Literature review

CJB searched EMBASE, MEDLINE, CINAHL and Current Contents for systematic reviews and randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published between January 2010 and June 2015. To be eligible, publications were (i) the most current systematic reviews including meta-analyses and (ii) any RCTs published subsequent to the most recent systematic review.

Search terms used to search titles and abstracts of papers relating to patellofemoral pain in each database were (patella or patellofemoral) and (pain or syndrome or dysfunction). To narrow the search to identify systematic reviews, these diagnostic terms were combined with the keyword review.

To narrow the search to identify any contemporary randomised trials, diagnostic terms were combined with (controlled trial or clinical trial) and additional searching was completed in the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro). Additionally, all authors on this consensus statement were consulted to identify any missing papers. To be included, randomised trials were required to evaluate one or more conservative intervention compared with a control or alternative conservative intervention, using an outcome measure related to pain (eg, pain visual analogue scale (VAS)) or patient-reported improvement, and using a randomised method for group allocation.

Data were extracted from each included paper. Where multiple systematic reviews were available for the same intervention from the same time period, findings from moderate–high quality reviews were used in preference to low-quality reviews. If no systematic reviews were available, all published RCTs related to the intervention were included. Findings from included reviews and trials were used to generate a summary table, which included study methodology, relevant outcomes and effect sizes.

The methodological quality of meta-analyses and systematic reviews was graded with the Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) tool; and RCTs were graded with the PEDro rating scale. Rating was completed by two independent reviewers (CJB and MvM), and discrepancies resolved through a consensus meeting. A third reviewer (KMC) was available to settle any disagreement but was not required.

Quality of evidence

For systematic reviews, the following allocation was applied based on AMSTAR scores:
High quality (HQ): ≥ 7
Moderate quality (MQ): 4–6
Low quality (LQ): ≤ 3

For RCTs, the following allocation was applied based on PEDro scores:
High quality (HQ): ≥ 7
Moderate quality (MQ): 4–6
Low quality (LQ): ≤ 3
