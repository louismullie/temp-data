## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which intervention is most likely to slow the progression of knee osteoarthritis in a 43-year-old man with obesity, smoking, and mild patellofemoral osteoarthritis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether the question is about symptom control versus disease modification. Then, I should verify which options have credible evidence for slowing structural progression. Next, I will appraise the evidence for each alternative, including NSAIDs, bracing, smoking cessation, and weight loss. Finally, I will synthesize and state the most evidence-based choice with practical guidance and caveats about what we can and cannot conclude from the data.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame. The patient has symptomatic knee osteoarthritis with obesity and smoking, and the question is explicitly about slowing disease progression rather than just relieving pain, which matters because many therapies improve symptoms without altering structural outcomes. I need to ensure I prioritize interventions with disease-modifying signals or strong guideline endorsement for progression risk reduction, even if symptom benefits are modest or mixed in some studies [^e29d652e] [^21659233].

> Now, I will examine NSAIDs like meloxicam. Wait, let me verify whether NSAIDs slow structural progression. The evidence base shows NSAIDs improve pain and function but does not demonstrate slowing of radiographic progression or cartilage loss, and guidelines position NSAIDs as symptom-control agents rather than disease-modifying therapy, so meloxicam would not be expected to slow OA progression despite symptom relief [^1f52ef2e] [^21659233].

> Next, I should review unloader bracing. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. Bracing can reduce pain and improve function in some patients, but high-quality evidence for slowing structural progression is limited and mixed, with biomechanical studies showing small, sometimes inconsistent changes in joint loading and low long-term adherence undermining sustained benefit. Thus, bracing is not the most reliable strategy for slowing disease progression in this context [^1276b134] [^75d536bf] [^a3ac2462].

> I will now examine smoking cessation. Smoking is associated with increased cartilage loss and worse pain in men with knee OA, so quitting is sensible for health and may reduce progression risk, but I should confirm whether there are direct, prospective data showing that smoking cessation slows structural progression. I don't see robust longitudinal trials proving disease-modifying effects of smoking cessation on OA outcomes, so while cessation is important, the evidence for slowing progression is indirect and weaker than for weight loss [^23551e33].

> Let me consider weight loss carefully. Multiple high-quality sources support weight loss as the most impactful modifiable intervention for slowing progression in overweight/obese knee OA. The ACR/Arthritis Foundation guideline strongly recommends weight loss, with benefits accruing at ≥ 5% and increasing with 5–10% and > 10% weight loss, and the VA/DoD guideline similarly endorses weight management to reduce cumulative joint loading and improve outcomes. Longitudinal MRI data from the Osteoarthritis Initiative show that ≥ 10% weight loss slows cartilage degeneration over 4–8 years, and observational data link weight loss with reduced risk of total knee replacement, supporting disease-modifying potential at the population level [^21659233] [^7681f563] [^3a21f207] [^30726fc2] [^e99a0225].

> But wait, what if the structural benefits take time to manifest and short-term trials miss them. I should double-check the randomized data. The IDEA trial did not show differences in radiographic joint space narrowing or quantitative cartilage thickness over 18 months across diet, diet plus exercise, and exercise-only arms, despite symptom and mechanistic improvements, which tempers certainty about short-term structural effects. Still, longer-term observational cohorts and guidelines continue to support weight loss as the most evidence-aligned strategy for slowing progression, especially when sustained beyond 1–2 years, so the balance of evidence favors weight loss as the best answer here [^2218c9a6] [^21659233] [^3a21f207].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the hierarchy. NSAIDs are for symptoms, not progression. Bracing has limited and inconsistent structural evidence and adherence issues. Smoking cessation is health-critical but lacks direct progression data. Weight loss has the strongest, most consistent evidence and guideline support for slowing progression in overweight/obese knee OA, making it the most likely effective intervention to slow disease progression in this patient [^21659233] [^7681f563] [^3a21f207].

> Final answer: E. Weight loss. I need to ensure the practical takeaway is clear. Aim for at least 5% weight loss, ideally 10% or more if feasible, using diet with or without exercise, and pair with education and follow-up to sustain change, recognizing that benefits on symptoms and potential slowing of progression accrue with sustained weight reduction over time [^21659233] [^7681f563] [^3a21f207].

The most effective intervention to slow progression of knee osteoarthritis in this patient is **weight loss** [^21659233] [^d09e80a4], as it reduces joint load, inflammation, and cartilage degeneration [^32973069] [^3a21f207]. Smoking cessation is important for overall health but has **limited direct evidence** for slowing OA progression [^23551e33]. NSAIDs and topical agents provide symptom relief but do not alter disease progression [^1f52ef2e], and unloader braces have inconsistent effects on progression and low adherence [^75d536bf] [^a3ac2462]. Weight loss of at least 5–10% is strongly recommended by guidelines and supported by longitudinal data showing slower cartilage degeneration and improved symptoms [^21659233] [^3a21f207].

---

## Evidence for weight loss in slowing OA progression

- **Mechanisms**: Weight loss reduces mechanical load, lowers inflammatory mediators, and may slow cartilage degeneration [^32973069] [^22cfb437].

- **Clinical evidence**: The Osteoarthritis Initiative found that ≥ 10% weight loss slowed cartilage degeneration over 48 months and improved symptoms [^3a21f207].

- **Guideline support**: ACR/AAOS strongly recommend weight loss ≥ 5% for overweight/obese patients with knee OA [^21659233] [^d09e80a4].

---

## Evidence for smoking cessation

Smoking is associated with **increased cartilage loss and pain** in knee OA, but direct evidence that quitting slows progression is limited [^23551e33]. Nevertheless, smoking cessation is essential for overall health and may indirectly benefit OA by reducing inflammation and improving healing.

---

## Evidence for NSAIDs and topical agents

NSAIDs (e.g. meloxicam) provide **symptom relief** but do not slow structural progression [^1f52ef2e]. Topical NSAIDs offer local pain relief with fewer systemic effects, yet likewise do not alter disease progression [^notfound].

---

## Evidence for unloader knee braces

Unloader braces may reduce pain and improve function, but **evidence for slowing progression is inconsistent** [^1276b134] [^a3ac2462]. Adherence is often poor due to discomfort and limited sustained benefit [^75d536bf].

---

## Summary of evidence

| **Intervention** | **Evidence for slowing progression** | **Guideline recommendation** |
|-|-|-|
| Weight loss | Strong evidence; slows cartilage degeneration and improves symptoms [^3a21f207] [^30726fc2] | Strongly recommended [^21659233] [^d09e80a4] |
| Smoking cessation | Limited direct evidence; indirect benefits likely [^23551e33] | Recommended for general health |
| NSAIDs/topical agents | No evidence for slowing progression [^1f52ef2e] | Recommended for symptom control |
| Unloader braces | Inconsistent evidence; limited adherence [^a3ac2462] [^75d536bf] | Conditionally recommended for symptom relief |

---

Weight loss is the **most effective intervention** to slow knee OA progression in this patient, with strong evidence and guideline support [^21659233] [^d09e80a4]. Smoking cessation is important for health but lacks direct progression data; NSAIDs and braces help symptoms but do not modify disease course [^1f52ef2e] [^a3ac2462].

### Progression of cartilage degeneration and clinical symptoms in obese and overweight individuals is dependent on the amount of weight loss: 48-month data from the osteoarthritis initiative [^3a21f207]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate compositional cartilage changes measured with 3T MRI-based T2 values over 48 months in overweight and obese individuals with different degrees of weight loss (WL) and to study whether WL slows knee cartilage degeneration and symptom worsening.

Design

We studied participants from the Osteoarthritis Initiative with risk factors or radiographic evidence of mild to moderate knee osteoarthritis with a baseline BMI ≥ 25 kg/m². We selected subjects who over 48 months lost a, moderate (BMI change, 5–10%WL, n = 180) or large amount of weight (≥ 10%WL, n = 78) and frequency-matched these to individuals with stable weight (< 3%, n = 258). Right knee cartilage T2 maps of all compartments and grey-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) texture analyses were evaluated and associations with WL and clinical symptoms (WOMAC subscales for pain, stiffness and disability) were assessed using multivariable regression models.

Results

The amount of weight change was significantly associated with change in cartilage T2 of the medial tibia (β 0.9 ms, 95% CI 0.4 to 1.1, P = 0.001). Increase of T2 in the medial tibia was significantly associated with increase in WOMAC pain (β 0.5 ms, 95% CI 0.2 to 0.6, P = 0.02) and disability (β 0.03 ms, 95% CI 0.003 to 0.05, P = 0.03). GLCM contrast and variance over all compartments showed significantly less progression in the > 10%WL group compared to the stable weight group (both comparisons, P = 0.04).

Conclusions

WL over 48 months is associated with slowed knee cartilage degeneration and improved knee symptoms.

### A new approach yields high rates of radiographic progression in knee osteoarthritis [^adee7e7a]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

Progression of knee osteoarthritis (OA) has typically been assessed in the medial tibiofemoral (TF) compartment on the anteroposterior (AP) or posteroanterior (PA) view. We propose a new approach using multiple views and compartments that is likely to be more sensitive to change and reveals progression throughout the knee.

Methods

We tested our approach in the Multicenter Osteoarthritis Study, a study of persons with OA or at high risk of disease. At baseline and 30 months, subjects provided PA (fixed flexion without fluoro) and lateral weight-bearing knee radiographs. Paired radiographs were read by 2 readers who scored joint space (JS) using a 0–3 atlas-based scale. When JS narrowed but narrowing did not reach a full grade on the scale, readers used half-grades. Change was scored in medial and lateral TF compartments on both PA and lateral views and in the patellofemoral (PF) joint on lateral view. A knee showed progression when there was at least a half-grade worsening in JS width in any compartment at followup. Disagreements were adjudicated by a panel of 3 readers. To validate progression, we tested definitions for TF progression to see if malalignment on long-limb radiographs at baseline (≥ 3 degrees malaligned in any direction with nonmalaligned knees being reference) increased risk of progression. A valid definition of progression would show that malalignment strongly predicted progression.

Results

We studied 842 knees with either Kellgren-Lawrence grade ≥ 2 or PF OA at baseline in 606 subjects (age range 50–79 yrs, mean 63.9 yrs; 66.6% women). Mean body mass index was 31.9, and 32.8% of knees had frequent knee pain at baseline. Of these, 500 knees (59.4%) showed progression. Of the 500, 75 (15%) had progression only in the PF joint, while the remainder had progression in the TF joint. Malalignment increased the risk of overall progression in TF joint and increased the risk of half-grade progression, suggesting that half-grade progression had validity.

Conclusion

PA and lateral views obtained in persons at high risk of OA progression can produce a cumulative incidence of progression above 50% at 30 months. Keys to increasing the yield include imaging PF and lateral compartments, using semiquantitative scales designed to detect change, and examining more than one radiographic view.

### Medial compartment defects progress at a more rapid rate than lateral cartilage defects in older adults with minimal to moderate knee osteoarthritis (OA): data from the OA initiative [^c8716942]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To determine: (1) rates and risk factors for progression of lateral and medial full-thickness cartilage defect size in older adults without severe knee osteoarthritis (OA), and (2) whether risk factors for defect progression differ for knees with Kellgren-Lawrence OA grade 3 (moderate) OA versus grades 0–2 (none to mild) OA.

Methods

Three-hundred and eighty adults enrolled in the Osteoarthritis Initiative were included (43% male, mean age 63.0 SD 9.2 years). Ethical approval was obtained at all study sites prior to enrollment. All participants had full-thickness tibial or weight-bearing femoral condylar cartilage defects on baseline knee MRIs. Baseline OA grade was KL grade 3 in 71.3% and grades 0–2 in 21.7% of participants. Repeat MRIs were obtained at a minimum 2-year follow-up. Independent risk of progression in defect size due to demographic factors, knee alignment, OA grade, knee injury and surgery history, and baseline knee symptoms was determined by multivariate Cox proportional hazards and linear regression modeling.

Results

The average increase in defect size over 2 years for lateral defects was 0.18 cm² (SD 0.60) and for medial defects was 0.49 cm² (SD 1.09). Independent predictors of medical defect size progression were bipolar defects (beta 0.47 SE 0.08; p < 0.001), knee varus (per degree, beta 0.08 SE 0.03; p = 0.02) and increased weight (per kg, beta = 0.01 SE 0.004; p = 0.01). Independent predictors for lateral defect progression were larger baseline defect size (per 1.0 cm², beta 0.14 SE 0.03; p < 0.001) and tibial sided defects (beta 0.12 SE 0.04) and degrees valgus (per degree, beta 0.04 SE 0.01; p = 0.001).

Conclusions

Medial compartment full-thickness defects progress at a more rapid rate than lateral defects in older adults with minimal to moderate OA. Medial defect progression was greatest for bipolar defects in heavier adults with varus knees. Lateral defect progression was greatest for large tibial-sided defects in adults with valgus knees.

### External knee adduction and flexion moments during gait and medial tibiofemoral disease progression in knee osteoarthritis [^797d483f]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2015). Low credibility.

There are several limitations in this study. Follow-up time longer than 2 years may be needed to detect associations between baseline KAM parameters and semi-quantitative cartilage damage progression. Employing an alternative within-grade WORMS scoring method may increase the sensitivity to longitudinal change of cartilage damage. Although KFM was not associated with disease progression, alternative novel knee load indices, e.g. the total knee reaction moment, which represents the magnitude of external knee moments in all three planes, may potentially better capture medial knee load and predict disease progression. Mean BMI of our sample was in the overweight range; results may not be generalizable to a healthy-weight or obese population. Lastly, our sample included knees predominantly with mild OA; findings may differ in knees at a later stage of disease.

As the trajectory and experience of pain in knee OA often does not correspond well to the trajectory of disease progression, future studies should carefully evaluate this outcome. Both quantitative and qualitative aspects of physical activity are important in further understanding the association between KAM and disease progression knee OA. The role of physical activity in the KAM-disease progression relationship should be evaluated in future studies.

In conclusion, in persons with knee OA, greater baseline peak KAM and KAM impulse were each associated with baseline-to-2-year worsening of medial tibiofemoral bone marrow lesions but not cartilage damage assessed semi-quantitatively. Higher baseline KAM impulse predicted 2-year medial cartilage thickness loss assessed quantitatively both as percent loss and as loss defined by a threshold, whereas peak KAM was related to medial cartilage loss only as % loss. There was no evidence of a relationship between baseline peak KFM and any measure of progression. These findings support targeting KAM parameters in an effort to delay medial OA disease progression.

### Tackling obesity in knee osteoarthritis [^32973069]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2013). Medium credibility.

Obesity and knee osteoarthritis (OA), two of the most common chronic diseases, are often comorbid. Obesity increases the risk of knee OA by a variety of mechanisms, such as increased joint loading and changes in body composition, with detrimental effects related to metainflammation and behavioural factors, including diminished physical activity and subsequent loss of protective muscle strength. These complex interactions present a challenge to the managing physician. The risk of knee OA related to weight gain and obesity begins from an early age. Weight loss reduces the risk of incident knee OA, and, in established disease, reduces symptoms, improves function and is likely to reduce disease progression. We review strategies to facilitate weight loss, with particular reference to their application in people with knee OA. Although knee OA presents intrinsic barriers to weight management, weight loss is possible at all stages of disease. Exercise or muscle strengthening are desirable for general health and to improve function, but are not essential to achieve weight loss and a successful symptomatic result. The degree of weight loss required to achieve benefit might be greater with increasing disease severity. Finally, we outline the need for a societal approach to tackle obesity-related OA.

### Disease progression after lateral and medial unicondylar knee arthroplasty [^47380240]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) has been a successful option for treatment of arthritis in patients with a healthy lateral compartment. However, lateral UKA is less common and results are less consistent. The purpose of this study is to compare progression of radiographically evident osteoarthritis in unoperated compartments during 5 years after lateral and medial UKA.

Methods

We undertook serial radiographic evaluation of 20 lateral and 114 medial UKA performed by the senior author during calendar years 2007–2008. Anteroposterior, lateral, and skyline radiographs obtained preoperatively and 1 and 5+ (mean, 5.3; range, 5.1–6.4) years postoperatively were independently graded for osteoarthritis in the unoperated tibiofemoral (TF) and patellofemoral (PF) compartments using established scales of Kellgren (0–4 point global scale for osteoarthritis), Ahlbäck (0–5 point scale based on joint space narrowing), and Altman (0–12 point composite criteria score). Rates of disease progression were compared between lateral and medial UKA groups using bivariate methods and multilevel growth models that adjusted for baseline characteristics.

Results

All mean disease grades for the TF and PF compartments increased (worsened) over time. The adjusted rate of Kellgren grade change was statistically (P < .05) faster for lateral UKA in the TF and PF compartments, as was Ahlbäck change in the TF compartment. Kellgren grade for the TF compartment of lateral and medial UKA groups increased 1.1 vs 0.6 points on average over 5 years adjusted for age, sex, and body mass index (P < .001).

Conclusion

Surgeons should consider the propensity for faster disease progression after UKA in evaluating patients with isolated lateral compartment disease.

### Synovitis: a potential predictive factor of structural progression of medial tibiofemoral knee osteoarthritis – results of a 1 year longitudinal arthroscopic study in 422 patients [^d25cc7b0]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the prevalence of synovitis in painful medial tibiofemoral knee osteoarthritis (OA) and to evaluate correlation between synovitis and the structural severity and progression of tibiofemoral cartilage damage.

Study

Multicenter, longitudinal, 1-year duration.

Patients

Primary painful knee OA (ACR criteria) of the medial tibiofemoral compartment, with pain of the signal knee on at least 30 days in the past 2 months, medial joint space width ≥ 2mm, at least 10% of one cartilage surface of the medial compartment affected by superficial fibrillation or worse at baseline arthroscopy. ARTHROSCOPIC PARAMETERS: Knee arthroscopy under local anesthesia was performed and videorecorded at entry and after 1 year. Medial chondropathy was scored by using Societe Francaise d'Arthroscopie (SFA) score (0–100) and reader's overall assessment (VAS score, 100 mm). Progression of medial chondropathy was defined by a change in SFA and VAS scores over 4.5 and 8.0 mm after 1 year, respectively. Medial perimeniscal synovium was scored as normal (few translucent and slender villi, fine vascular network), reactive (proliferation of opaque villi), or inflammatory (hypervascularization and/or proliferation of hypertrophic and hyperemic villi). Medial chondropathy and synovitis were scored by a single reader blind to chronology of paired videotapes.

Results

Four hundred and twenty-two patients were enrolled (mean age: 61 years, females: 59%, body mass index: 31, mean disease duration: 4 years) and completed the 1-year study. Synovial abnormalities were present in 50% of the patients with reactive and inflammatory aspects in 29% and 21% of the patients, respectively. Patients with a reactive or inflammatory medial synovium had a more severe medial chondropathy. The worsening in medial chondropathy after 1 year was statistically more severe in the group of patients with an inflammatory perimeniscal synovial membrane at baseline compared to patients with normal and reactive aspects, with no difference between these two latter groups. The odds ratio for progression in VAS score after 1 year was 3.11 (95% CI [1.07, 5.69]) for patients with inflammatory synovium at baseline compared to patients with normal synovium.

Conclusions

This study suggests that abnormalities of the medial perimeniscal synovium are a common feature of painful medial knee OA, associated with more severe medial chondropathy. It also suggests that an inflammatory aspect of the medial perimeniscal synovium could be considered as a predictive factor of subsequent increased degradation of medial chondropathy.

### Strategies for the prevention of knee osteoarthritis [^4e03888b]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2016). Medium credibility.

Osteoarthritis (OA) has been thought of as a disease of cartilage that can be effectively treated surgically at severe stages with joint arthroplasty. Today, OA is considered a whole-organ disease that is amenable to prevention and treatment at early stages. OA develops slowly over 10–15 years, interfering with activities of daily living and the ability to work. Many patients tolerate pain, and many health-care providers accept pain and disability as inevitable corollaries of OA and ageing. Too often, health-care providers passively await final 'joint death', necessitating knee and hip replacements. Instead, OA should be viewed as a chronic condition, where prevention and early comprehensive-care models are the accepted norm, as is the case with other chronic diseases. Joint injury, obesity and impaired muscle function are modifiable risk factors amenable to primary and secondary prevention strategies. The strategies that are most appropriate for each patient should be identified, by selecting interventions to correct — or at least attenuate — OA risk factors. We must also choose the interventions that are most likely to be acceptable to patients, to maximize adherence to — and persistence with — the regimes. Now is the time to begin the era of personalized prevention for knee OA.

### Obesity and osteoarthritis: disease genesis and nonpharmacologic weight management [^2a0c2505]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

The mechanisms by which obesity affects osteoarthritis (OA) are of great concern to osteoarthritis researchers and clinicians who manage this disease. Inflammation and joint loads are pathways commonly believed to cause or to exacerbate the disease process. This article reviews the physiologic and mechanical consequences of obesity in older adults who have knee OA, the effects of long-term exercise and weight-loss interventions, the most effective nonpharmacologic treatments for obesity, and the usefulness and feasibility of translating these results to clinical practice.

### One-year, efficacy and safety open label study, with a single injection of a new hyaluronan for knee OA: the SOYA trial [^6ffb4c0a]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Study Population

Eligible patients were men and women aged ≥ 45 years who met the following inclusion criteria: diagnosis of primary OA of the knee in the medial/lateral tibiofemoral compartment according to ACR criteria; radiological grade 2–3 according to the Kellgren and Lawrence (KL) scaleconfirmed by an anteroposterior X-ray; and VAS pain scores ≥ 40 – < 80 mm in the target knee and ≤ 20 mm in the contralateral knee. Patients had to be able to understand and comply with the study procedures and give their written consent to participate before entering in the study.

Exclusion criteria comprised a body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m², a severe varus/valgus deformity (> 15°) or patellofemoral pain/syndrome, previous surgery in the target knee including arthroscopy within the past year, severe inflammation of the target knee, an inflammatory joint disease, significant OA in other joints requiring pharmacological treatment, venous or lymphatic stasis in the relevant limb. Patients with the following treatments were also excluded: intra-articular HA (within the last year), intra-articular corticosteroids or joint lavage (last 3 months) and symptomatic slow-acting drugs for OA (SYSADOA). Finally, patients could not participate if they had known hypersensitivity to HA or paracetamol, were pregnant or breastfeeding, or if they were on a waiting list for surgery or awaiting a disability assessment.

Outcome Measures

We used patient-reported outcomes and derived measures to evaluate the efficacy of the treatment. The primary endpoint was a reduction in pain intensity measured on a 0–100 mm VAS, where 0 was the absence of pain and 100 was extreme pain. Secondary variables included the Western Ontario and McMaster (WOMAC) Universities Osteoarthritis Index total and subscale scores for pain (WOMAC A), stiffness (WOMAC B) and physical function (WOMAC C); all were measured on a VAS and normalized. Similarly, the percentage of patients who achieved the minimum clinically important improvement (MCII), defined as a relative improvement over baseline of ≥ 20% in VAS scores, was another secondary endpoint. The patient global assessment (PGA) and investigator global assessment (IGA) were measured on a 5-point Likert scale where 0 was the best condition and 4 the worst. Adverse events (AEs) were recorded from screening until the end of the study.

### Early-stage symptomatic osteoarthritis of the knee-time for action [^e29d652e]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2021). High credibility.

Osteoarthritis (OA) remains the most challenging arthritic disorder, with a high burden of disease and no available disease-modifying treatments. Symptomatic early-stage OA of the knee (the focus of this Review) urgently needs to be identified and defined, as efficient early-stage case finding and diagnosis in primary care would enable health-care providers to proactively and substantially reduce the burden of disease through proper management including structured education, exercise and weight management (when needed) and addressing lifestyle-related risk factors for disease progression. Efforts to define patient populations with symptomatic early-stage knee OA on the basis of validated classification criteria are ongoing. Such criteria, as well as the identification of molecular and imaging biomarkers of disease risk and/or progression, would enable well-designed clinical studies, facilitate interventional trials, and aid the discovery and validation of cellular and molecular targets for novel therapies. Treatment strategies, relevant outcomes and ethical issues also need to be considered in the context of the cost-effective management of symptomatic early-stage knee OA. To move forwards, a multidisciplinary and sustained international effort involving all major stakeholders is required.

### Risk stratification for knee osteoarthritis progression: a narrative review [^743860ae]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

A narrative review describing the assessment of osteoarthritis (OA) progression, and more specifically the risk factors which assist in delineating strata of individuals at greatest risk for more rapid progression.

Design

A narrative review based on selected recent medical literature.

Results

With little currently available in the treatment of this disease, better understanding of responsive and valid endpoints is essential to identifying potential new interventions for treatment of OA. Efforts to stratify those at greatest risk for progression can use a number of systemic or local risk factors that may assist in delineating populations at greater risk for progression.

Conclusions

Current data suggests that stratification of risk is feasible to ascertain those at risk for rapid progression using a number of different metrics including knee alignment, meniscal damage, bone marrow lesions and late stage disease. Identifying persons at greatest risk for progression has important implications for clinical trial planning and can enhance study efficiency.

### Unload it: the key to the treatment of knee osteoarthritis [^e479ce0b]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2011). Low credibility.

Osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee is a major public health problem whose prevalence is expected to grow dramatically commensurate with the aging of the population and increasing rates of obesity. Unfortunately, little progress has been made therapeutically to avert this epidemic. We hypothesize that the lack of effective interventions is due, in large part, to an overemphasis on pharmacotherapy and direct chondral repair. Instead, we propose that research and development efforts be aimed at addressing the aberrant biomechanics that are the primary driver in the progression of knee OA. In particular, technologies that "unload" the joint may reverse the structural damage, which is the cardinal feature of this disease. Re-establishing a favorable local mechanical environment may not only delay the requirement for an invasive joint reconstruction procedure but obviate the need entirely.

### Elevated tibiofemoral articular contact stress predicts risk for bone marrow lesions and cartilage damage at 30 months [^58db3a5c]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

As cartilage loss and bone marrow lesions (BMLs) are associated with knee joint pain and structural worsening, this study assessed whether non-invasive estimates of articular contact stress may longitudinally predict risk for worsening of knee cartilage morphology and BMLs.

Design

This was a longitudinal cohort study of adults aged 50–79 years with risk factors for knee osteoarthritis. Baseline and follow-up measures included whole-organ magnetic resonance imaging score (WORMS) classification of knee cartilage morphology and BMLs. Tibiofemoral geometry was manually segmented on baseline magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and three-dimensional (3D) tibiofemoral point clouds were registered into subject-specific loaded apposition using fixed-flexion knee radiographs. Discrete element analysis (DEA) was used to estimate mean and peak contact stresses for the medial and lateral compartments. The association of baseline contact stress with worsening cartilage and BMLs in the same subregion over 30 months was assessed using conditional logistic regression.

Results

Subjects (N = 38, 60.5% female) had a mean ± standard deviation (SD) age and body mass index (BMI) of 63.5 ± 8.4 years and 30.5 ± 3.7 kg/m² respectively. Elevated mean articular contact stress at baseline was associated with worsening cartilage morphology and worsening BMLs by 30 months, with odds ratio (OR) [95% confidence interval (CI)] of 4.0 (2.5, 6.4) and 6.6 (2.7, 16.5) respectively. Peak contact stress also was significantly associated with worsening cartilage morphology and BMLs {1.9 (1.5, 2.3) and 2.3 (1.5, 3.6)}(all P < 0.0001).

Conclusions

Detection of higher contact stress 30 months prior to structural worsening suggests an etiological role for mechanical loading. Estimation of articular contact stress with DEA is an efficient and accurate means of predicting subregion-specific knee joint worsening and may be useful in guiding prognosis and treatment.

### The young osteoarthritic knee: dilemmas in management [^7fc02899]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The number of young patients seeking medical consultation for symptoms relating to osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee is increasing. This is thought to be due to a combination of factors. Longer life expectancy also means that the proportion of the population continuing physically demanding careers and sporting lifestyles into their fifth, sixth, and even seventh decades is increasing. In addition to these risks, there are rising levels of obesity and there is clear evidence that the risk of OA is increased with obesity. Allied to the increasing rates of OA are patient expectations that a return to previous levels of activity should be possible following injury or trauma.

Osteoarthritis is a dynamic and metabolically active disease that involves all tissue components of the joint: bone, cartilage, synovium, muscle, and ligament. The key pathological features are of articular cartilage softening, fibrillation, and then ulceration leading to sclerosis and eburnation of subchondral bone. Articular cartilage degradation leads to release of inflammatory mediators and further joint damage due to this inflammatory component, thus the frequent reference to 'degenerative arthritis' is incorrect. Subchondral cyst and osteophyte formation are later features.

Patients with OA of the knee present with symptoms that include joint pain, swelling, stiffness, crepitus, loss of function, and reduced quality of life. The initial management of OA of the knee should be non-operative, however, these measures often provide only limited and temporary benefit. Not until these options have been exhausted should surgical options be explored. Non-operative strategies may include patient education, exercise, weight loss, bracing, analgesia, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and possibly intra-articular (IA) injections. Although many of these treatment methods are employed the evidence for their benefit is mixed.

Meta-analyses have shown the benefit of muscle strengthening and aerobic exercise in the management of OA but have highlighted the importance of patient compliance. The medical benefits of weight loss for the obese patient are clear. While it seems logical that weight loss should also relieve the pain associated with OA the evidence that weight loss can delay or even reverse symptoms associated with OA of the knee remains mixed. There are studies that have shown bracing to be effective. Bracing aims to reduce the biomechanical load in the affected compartment of the knee, or improve symptoms by reducing perceived instability. Although potentially effective, bracing is poorly tolerated by patients due to discomfort or skin complications, such as blistering, and there is evidence that compliance with long-term bracing for orthopedic conditions is poor.

### The longterm outcome of osteoarthritis: rates and predictors of joint space narrowing in symptomatic patients with knee osteoarthritis [^cfbecb73]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the rate of progression of radiographic joint space narrowing (JSN) and the factors that predict it in symptomatic clinic patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA).

Methods

In total 1,507 patients with knee OA were studied with extended weight-bearing anterior-posterior views of the knee as part of a longitudinal study of longterm outcomes of osteoarthritis (OA). Baseline demographic and severity measurements included body mass index (BMI), pain, global severity, Health Assessment Questionnaire disability, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Rates and predictors of progression were obtained by Kaplan-Meier survival analyses and Cox regressions using a JSN score of 3 as "failure".

Results

For the 1,232 patients who had not reached the endpoint narrowing score of 3 when first evaluated, the 75th and 50th survival times (time to JSN = 3) were 11.27 and 17.84 years for those with JSN = 0 at onset, 7.41 and 12.03 years for those with JSN = 1 at onset, and 4.49 and 7.44 years for those with JSN = 2 at onset. The corresponding yearly incidence rates for the 3 initial groups were 0.017, 0.032, and 0.077. In multivariate Cox models, initial JSN, BMI, symptom duration, and global severity were predictors of progression, but only JSN was a strong predictor. BMI predicted JSN in those with JSN = 0 at onset, but not in patients with more severe disease. Although contralateral JSN predicted progression, it was only of value with initial homolateral JSN scores of 0. Assessment of homolateral osteophytes aided prediction in patients with initial JSN = 0, but was of much less help when JSN had a higher severity score.

Conclusion

The risk of progression in clinical OA patients with radiographic abnormalities is substantial. Nonradiographic predictors of OA progression (e.g. BMI) are weak predictors of radiographic progression compared to current radiographic status. Rates of progression are greatest in those with established radiographic abnormalities. Osteophytes are of limited additional values once JSN = 2 is present. Contralateral radiographic abnormalities are useful predictors only in those with JSN = 0. Intervention studies to prevent radiographic progression probably should utilize joints where evidence of abnormality already exists. At a clinical level, current radiographic status predicts future status, with 50% of patients with JSN = 1 and 50% of patients with JSN = 2 progressing to complete joint space loss in 12.03 and 7.44 years, respectively.

AAOS osteoarthritis of the knee (nonarthroplasty) — weight loss recommendation acceptability, feasibility, and research priorities are noted: Weight loss is "a commonly utilized approach in the optimization of patient who present with obesity and knee osteoarthritis", so "there should be no issues implementing this recommendation as it does not influence a major change in clinical practice", though "patients often are reluctant or unwilling to accept referrals for weight loss as a suggestion for a path to improvement". Because the recommendation "does not interfere with other interventions or clinical practice" it "is deemed very feasible in a subset of overweight and obese patients". For evidence gaps, "Future research should focus on large randomized clinical trials and should focus more on function and quality of life measures since it appears obvious that pain improved through weight loss".

### An implantable shock absorber yields an 85% survival-from-arthroplasty rate through 5 years in working-age patients with medial compartment knee osteoarthritis [^bed151b1]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate the 5-year rate of survival without undergoing arthroplasty or high tibial osteotomy (HTO) in subjects with mild-to-moderate medial compartment knee osteoarthritis (OA) who were treated with an implantable shock absorber (ISA) system.

Methods

Three prospective, sequential, multicenter, international, single-arm clinical trials were conducted comprising subjects who received an ISA for symptomatic medial knee OA after failing ≥ 6 months of conservative therapy. Study outcomes were analyzed cumulatively and by enrollment group when all subjects' follow-up data exceeded the 2-year threshold after ISA implantation. Primary outcome was survival rate without conversion to arthroplasty/HTO. Secondary outcomes were changes in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) pain and function scores after ISA implantation.

Results

All 171 enrolled subjects (age 51 ± 9 years, body-mass index 28.5 ± 3.5 kg/m², 38% female; study knee Kellgren-Lawrence score 2.7 ± 0.9 points) were followed for a minimum of 2, and up to 5, years after device implantation. Overall, 90.6% (155/171) of subjects survived without requiring arthroplasty/HTO at last follow-up (mean 3.2 ± 1.6 years). The Kaplan-Meyer median 3- and 5-year survival-without-arthroplasty point estimates were 89.8% (95% CI 86.5‒95.7%) and 84.9% (95% CI 75.1‒91.1%), respectively. The median 3-year estimated survival rate for the most recent study (n = 81) was 97.3%. The mean WOMAC Pain score decreased 71% from baseline to last follow-up after ISA implantation, from 58 ± 13 to 16 ± 17 points (p < 0.0001). The Function score improved 69%, decreasing from 56 ± 18 to 17 ± 17 points (p < 0.0001).

Conclusions

In younger patients with mild-to-moderate symptomatic medial compartment knee OA, implantation of the ISA device resulted in a 5-year survival rate of 85% from undergoing arthroplasty or HTO. The ISA system may be an effective treatment option for working-age patients with medial knee OA who are not candidates for or do not desire more invasive surgical approaches.

### Identifying common trajectories of joint space narrowing over two years in knee osteoarthritis [^227e8460]. Arthritis Care & Research (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

Little is known about the natural history of knee osteoarthritis (OA). We sought to identify common patterns of joint space narrowing (JSN) in well-characterized knee OA patients in the placebo arm of a 2-year international study.

Methods

We performed secondary data analyses of 622 adults ages 39–80 years in North America (n = 310) and Europe (n = 312) with symptomatic knee OA. Fluoroscopically positioned semiflexed anteroposterior radiographs were obtained at 0, 12, and 24 months. Group-based trajectory modeling was used to identify distinctive groups of individuals with similar trajectories of JSN, taking into account sex, age, and body mass index.

Results

Seven groups were identified. Four exhibited joint space width (JSW) stability over 2 years representing the most common trajectory (71%), which was unrelated to initial JSW. Atypical courses included slow, rapid, and moderate progressors; most had significant JSN at study entry. Slow progressors (20%) had a mean JSN of 0.2 mm over 2 years. Only 2% of the sample demonstrated rapid JSN (2.1 mm), while 7% had JSN of 0.7 mm. Rapid progressors tended to be men, while slow and moderate progressors were older and heavier.

Conclusion

Most (70%) people with OA demonstrated no significant JSN over 2 years; 20% showed slow progression, 7% had moderate, and 2% had rapid JSN. Progressors tended to have less JSW at study entry and were older and heavier; rapid progressors were more likely to be men. Understanding common patterns of the course of knee OA may offer new opportunities to target those at greatest risk of disability.

### Knee bracing for unicompartmental osteoarthritis [^1276b134]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2006). Low credibility.

Unicompartmental osteoarthritis of the knee affects millions of individuals. Most nonsurgical management of this progressive disease is primarily directed at reducing inflammation and pain with medication. Evidence supports the clinical efficacy of bracing for managing osteoarthritis of the knee. In some patients, bracing significantly reduces pain, increases function, and reduces excessive loading to the damaged compartment. A variety of health and functional status instruments, as well as radiologic techniques and biomechanical investigations, has been used to evaluate the unloading capabilities of these braces. Although changes in angulation are relatively minimal, the braces have been shown to load share and thus reduce the stresses in the degenerated medial compartment of the knee.

Recent recommendations from 6 professional societies support the importance of education, self-management approaches, weight loss, and physical modalities in managing OA. These recent guidelines also highlight the paucity of effective and safe treatment options, with recommendations against ineffective therapies outnumbering those for effective ones. NSAIDs, oral and topical, remain the primary recommended pharmacologic management option for OA.

### Loss of body weight is dose-dependently associated with reductions in symptoms of hip osteoarthritis [^aa73e497]. International Journal of Obesity (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common and disabling condition, characterized by joint pain and stiffness due to gradual cartilage erosion. Among its forms, hip OA is particularly debilitating, significantly limiting locomotor activity and functional ability, often progressing to a severity that necessitates joint replacement. In the past 30 years, the prevalence of hip OA has risen from 17.02 to 18.70 per 100,000 persons, a trend reflecting broader demographic changes such as an aging global population and increasing obesity rates. Obesity is a well-documented risk factor for both the development and progression of hip OA, likely due to increased mechanical loading and systemic inflammation. The increasing prevalence of hip OA, exacerbated in populations with obesity, highlights the need for effective symptom management strategies to improve the quality of life for affected individuals.

### AAOS clinical practice guideline summary: management of osteoarthritis of the knee (nonarthroplasty), third edition [^255e5bef]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2022). High credibility.

AAOS clinical practice guideline — weight loss intervention for knee osteoarthritis states: Sustained weight loss is recommended to improve pain and function in overweight and obese patients with knee osteoarthritis. Strength of Recommendation: Moderate. Overall pain and function improved with weight loss achieved through a combination of diet and exercise, and given the current evidence, it is at the discretion of the surgeon as to which approach is utilized to address weight loss, however a combination of diet and exercises appears to be the preferred alternative. The Weight Loss Intervention recommendation has been downgraded one level because of inconsistent evidence. There are no known or anticipated harms associated with implementing this recommendation. Management of obesity and overweight through weight loss may have high impact on symptoms and overall health. Weight loss presents a potentially high level of cost effectiveness compared to other surgical and nonsurgical approaches; however, the cost-effectiveness of different weight loss approaches is still to be determined.

### Weight loss regimen in obese and overweight individuals is associated with reduced cartilage degeneration: 96-month data from the osteoarthritis initiative [^30726fc2]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To investigate change in knee cartilage composition over 96 months in overweight and obese participants with constant weight compared to those with weight loss (WL), and to assess how different WL regimens are associated with these changes.

Methods

We studied right knees of 760 participants (age 62.6 ± 9.0y; 465 females) with a baseline body mass index (BMI) > 25 kg/m2 from the Osteoarthritis Initiative with mild to moderate or with risk factors for knee osteoarthritis. Participants losing weight (> 5% of baseline BMI over 72 months; N = 380) were compared to controls with stable weight (SW, N = 380). Participants losing weight were categorized based on WL method (diet and exercise, diet only, exercise only) and compared to those with stable weight. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 3T was performed at baseline, 48- and 96-months. The association of WL and WL method with change in cartilage composition, measured with T2 mapping, was analyzed using mixed random effects models.

Results

Compared to SW, WL was associated with a significantly slower increase in global (averaged over all compartments) cartilage T2 (adjusted mean difference of change in T2 ms/year [95% CI] between the groups: 0.24 [0.20, 0.41] ms/year; P < 0.001) and global deep layer cartilage T2 0.35 [0.20, 0.42] ms/year; P < 0.001), suggesting slower cartilage deterioration. Compared to the SW group, slower increases in global T2 were observed in the diet and diet and exercise groups, but not in the exercise only group (P = 0.042, P = 0.003 and P = 0.85, respectively).

Conclusion

Our results suggest that WL may slow knee cartilage degeneration over 96 months, and that these potential benefits may differ by method of WL.

Hip osteoarthritis — body mass index: A few studies have shown body mass index (BMI) to be related to hip OA, whereas other studies have shown little to no association; the most current evidence shows BMI is not related to hip OA. What seems apparent is that obesity is probably associated with the progression of hip OA rather than onset, and the therapeutic value of weight loss is important.

### Clinical significance of medial versus lateral compartment patellofemoral osteoarthritis: cross-sectional analyses in an adult population with knee pain [^fb940ac2]. Arthritis Care & Research (2017). Low credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Patellofemoral (PF) joint osteoarthritis (OA) contributes to knee pain and functional limitation 1, 2, 3 and may be a target for the early management of knee OA 4. Effective conservative management options for PF joint OA are lacking, with trials of bracing, taping, and exercise yielding conflicting results 5, 6, 7, 8. These conservative treatment strategies, as well as some surgical treatments, largely attempt to realign the patella medially to unload the lateral PF joint compartment. This is because PF joint OA is believed to be predominantly a disease of the lateral PF joint compartment based on the "law of valgus" put forward by Ficat and Hungerford in their seminal work on the disorders of the PF joint 9. The law suggests that the predominant frontal plane force acting on the patella during knee motion is directed laterally, leading to excessive loading of the lateral facet of the PF joint. This is in line with more recent biomechanical studies of the PF joint that report higher loading of the lateral PF joint facet 10, 11, 12, 13, with the lateral facet contact force estimated to be 4–6 times higher than the medial facet contact force 13.

Box 1
Significance & Innovations

However, a higher prevalence of OA in the lateral PF joint compartment is not consistently found in epidemiologic studies. In one of the earliest studies, of 66 orthopedic clinic patients with relatively severe knee OA, lateral PF joint disease was found on plain radiography in 89% of knees, compared with medial PF joint disease in only 11% of knees 14. Elahi et al included the dominant knees of 292 participants recruited from the community and showed that 67 of 86 participants with PF joint OA had evidence of predominantly lateral PF joint OA, whereas 19 had evidence of predominantly medial PF joint OA 15. In contrast, the higher frequency of lateral PF joint OA observed in these studies was recently challenged by evidence from large‐scale magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies of knee OA, which reported PF cartilage damage and bone marrow lesions (BMLs) in the medial compartment at least as often as in the lateral 16, 17, 18, 19 (see Supplementary Table 1, available on the Arthritis Care & Research web site at).

### Effect of weight maintenance on symptoms of knee osteoarthritis in obese patients: a twelve-month randomized controlled trial [^41f11a5f]. Arthritis Care & Research (2015). Low credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common joint disease. Currently, OA affects more than 20 million Americans, and this number is expected to double over the next 2 decades. In Britain, a study of those age ≥ 85 years showed that 52% were affected by OA. Risk factors include obesity, injuries, surgery, and occupational load. Obesity and OA share pathogenic features; the development of one disease increases the risk of the other–. As the average weight of the population increases, severe health consequences will ensue. The burden of obesity includes an increased number of nonfatal diseases, including OA imposing substantial medical costs from treatment and productivity losses. Accordingly, obesity must be taken seriously in any discussion of health, including that of the joints.

Current treatments can effectively target obesity in patients with coexistent obesity and OA, with short-term efficacy of weight loss comparable to that of a joint replacement. A meta-regression analysis showed that function in obese knee OA patients could be significantly improved when weight was reduced more than 5.1%, at the rate of 0.24% per week, indicating that physical function of overweight patients with knee OA improves even after a moderate weight reduction regimen. Accordingly, the Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) guidelines strongly recommended that overweight OA patients with lower extremity OA lose weight and maintain a lower weight level–.

There are no definitive data on whether weight loss is beneficial for reducing OA progression. However, available results from different study designs support the notion that intensive dietary-induced weight loss and exercise interventions may slow disease progression. Weight loss may be induced by using a low-energy diet strategy. Continuous dietary counseling is recommended to maintain weight loss, but in OA patients reinforcements of other activities for pain and disability improvement after weight loss may also be desirable. Exercise is recommended to improve pain and disability; exercise is also recommended as a means of losing weight and maintaining weight loss in the general population when it is combined with dietary change. Weight loss and exercise for obese OA patients are recommended by most guidelines. However, the effects of continuous dietary counseling and exercise on weight loss maintenance and clinical outcomes remain to be clarified.

### Trajectories of structural disease progression in knee osteoarthritis [^19d6105d]. Arthritis Care & Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a heterogeneous disease, with most patients experiencing slow disease progression and some with rapid deterioration. We aimed to identify groups of patients with symptomatic knee OA experiencing rapid structural progression.

Methods

We selected participants from the Osteoarthritis Initiative with baseline Kellgren/Lawrence (K/L) grades 1–3 and knee pain, and with joint space width (JSW) on fixed-flexion knee radiographs assessed at baseline and with ≥ 1 follow-up over 8 years. We used latent class growth analysis to identify subgroups of JSW progression, jointly modeling time to knee replacement (KR) to account for potential informative dropouts. After identifying trajectories, we used logistic regression to assess the association between baseline characteristics and the JSW trajectory group.

Results

We used data from 1,578 participants. Baseline radiographic severity was K/L grade 1 in 17%, K/L grade 2 in 50%, and K/L grade 3 in 33%. We identified 3 distinct JSW trajectories: 86% stable, 6% with stable JSW followed by late progression, and 8% with early progression. Incorporating information about KR resulted in 47% of KRs initially classified as stable being reclassified to 1 of the progressing trajectories. Prior knee surgery was associated with being in the late-progressing versus the stable trajectory, while obesity was associated with being in the early-progressing versus stable trajectory.

Conclusion

In addition to a subgroup of individuals experiencing early structural progression, 8-year longitudinal data allowed the identification of a late-progressing trajectory. Incorporating information about KR was important to properly identify longitudinal structural trajectories in knee OA.

### Does weight loss reduce the incidence of total knee and hip replacement for osteoarthritis? – A prospective cohort study among middle-aged and older adults with overweight or obesity [^e99a0225]. International Journal of Obesity (2021). Medium credibility.

It is worth noting that the lack of statistical significance in the association between weight gain and TKR could be due to a statistical 'ceiling effect' — i.e. the variance of weight change was no longer measurable when participants were grouped into the weight gain category. To explore this ceiling effect of weight gain, we conducted a subgroup analysis that used percentage weight loss as a continuous variable and examine the linear association separately in participants who lost and gained weight. The analysis showed a significant linear association between increasing percentage of weight change and TKR in both weight gain (HR 1.03, 95%CI 1.01–1.04) and weight-loss (HR 1.04, 95%CI 1.02–1.06) subgroups. Although the elevated HR for TKR in the weight gain > 5% group in our primary analysis did not reach a statistical significance when comparing to the weight stable group, people with overweight or obesity should still avoid further weight gain for the benefits of reducing the risk of cardiovascular comorbidities and diabetes.

The current study addresses the knowledge gap as to whether or not weight loss slows the progression of knee OA that leads to joint replacement surgery. One study in a cohort of people with obesity showed that weight loss was associated with reduced medial cartilage volume loss in the knees over 2.3 years, suggesting a disease-modifying effect of weight loss on knee joint structure. Data from the Osteoarthritis Initiative also found that an appreciable weight loss (> 10% of initial weight) slowed knee cartilage degeneration in people with overweight and obesity over a period of 4 years. In contrast, a randomised controlled trial reported that no differences were observed in cartilage loss, bone marrow lesion or synovitis over 1.5 years, between people with OA who lost ≥ 10% of their initial weight compared to those who did not. Similarly, in a more recent study among individuals with severe obesity undergoing either bariatric surgery, pharmacotherapy or other non-surgical medical interventions for weight loss, participants who lost ≥ 20% of their initial body weight had a rapid reduction in pain from knee OA over 1 year, but this was not accompanied by structural changes in the knee compared to those who lost < 20% of their initial weight. The results from our study address this knowledge gap by showing the long-term benefit of weight loss > 7.5% in reducing progression to TKR for OA in individuals with overweight or obesity.

### Towards secondary prevention of early knee osteoarthritis [^a2592adf]. RMD Open (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee is the most common arthritic disease, yet there is no convincing drug treatment available today that affects the progression of the disease process. There are many reasons for this, including the lack of understanding of what drives the disease process and the heterogeneity of the patient population. Indeed, there is considerable variability in disease trajectories, also dependent on patient profiles and the defined outcomes, leading to a need for disease stratification. A recent report has proposed a framework for the investigation of clinical and structural phenotypes; the patient characteristics and disease stage should be considered as most relevant for stratification of patients to be used in future studies. This approach will be of value for the field, but from a pragmatic clinical standpoint, it neither helps the individual patient nor the clinician facing the patient, today. However, we believe there is reasonable scientific evidence from studies in both animals and the human model that a personalised, patient-centred approach can result in successful clinical outcomes.

Therefore, in this narrative, we try to integrate scientific evidence and our professional experience to illustrate which approaches can be taken for prototypical individual patient profiles that are most likely going to successfully alleviate pain, control symptoms and signs, maintain or restore function and perhaps even affect the disease course. For sure, it is not our goal to be fully comprehensive, and we made some choices. This paper focuses on secondary prevention, thus on early knee OA, as we believe this being a window of opportunity for interventions that benefit the patient. As OA develops slowly, in most cases, pain, symptoms/signs and loss of function precede radiographic changes, although the opposite is also possible in some cases. Consequently, there is in general poor disease management in clinical practice over the course of the disease. Indeed, typical examinations in primary care do not reveal abnormalities in blood exam and imaging, certainly not in early disease, and the patient is getting the message to adapt and cope with it. Healthcare providers are not taking any coordinated action and await late stage disease associated with pronounced clinical manifestations including severe functional limitations and radiographic advanced disease. Then, more attention is geared towards surgical interventions mostly total knee replacement (with some exceptions). However, OA is a chronic disease process and begs for early disease intervention, as has been illustrated in other chronic arthritic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis.

### Cigarette smoking and the risk for cartilage loss and knee pain in men with knee osteoarthritis [^23551e33]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine the effects of smoking on cartilage loss and pain at the knee in individuals with knee osteoarthritis.

Methods

159 men with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis who participated in a 30-month, prospective, natural history study of knee osteoarthritis were examined. The more symptomatic knee was imaged using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at baseline, and again at 15 and 30 months of follow-up. Cartilage was scored using the Whole-Organ MRI Score semiquantitative method at the medial and lateral tibiofemoral joints and at the patellofemoral joint. At baseline and follow-up visits, the severity of knee pain was assessed using a Visual Analogue Scale pain score (0–100 mm).

Results

Among the 159 men, 19 (12%) were current smokers at baseline. Current smokers were younger (mean (standard deviation (SD)) age 62 (9) v 69 (9) years) and leaner (mean (SD) body mass index (BMI): 28.9 (3.2) v 31.3 (4.8) kg/m²) than men who were not current smokers. When adjusted for age, BMI and baseline cartilage scores, men who were current smokers were found to have an increased risk for cartilage loss at the medial tibiofemoral joint (odds ratio (OR) 2.3, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.0 to 5.4) and the patellofemoral joint (OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.1 to 5.7). Current smokers also had higher adjusted pain scores at baseline (60.5 v 45.0, p < 0.05) and at follow-up (59.4 v 44.3, p < 0.05) than men who were not current smokers.

Conclusions

Men with knee osteoarthritis who smoke sustain greater cartilage loss and have more severe knee pain than men who do not smoke.

### Association between body weight fluctuation and progression of radiographic knee osteoarthritis: a longitudinal cohort study [^affc9a7c]. RMD Open (2025). Medium credibility.

Our findings suggest that weight variability itself may represent an independent and clinically relevant risk factor. Previous studies have largely focused on the impact of static body weight or BMI on knee osteoarthritis, with less attention given to the role of weight fluctuations. Although weight loss is recommended for osteoarthritis management, most patients experience a pattern of losing weight initially, only to regain it afterwards. The question of whether such fluctuations are detrimental to osteoarthritis progression remains poorly understood. Our study selected ASV as the primary metric for assessing body weight variability due to its ability to effectively capture short-term fluctuations, such as weight cycling, which are directly relevant to our investigation into health outcomes like knee pain. Alongside ASV, we also utilised rASV, SD, VIM and CV to provide a comprehensive analysis encompassing both the dynamics of weight change and the overall dispersion of weight data. This combination of metrics allows for a nuanced understanding of how different patterns of weight variability influence health outcomes, enhancing the depth and applicability of our findings. In addition, we have incorporated continuous measures for WOMAC pain scores and JSL into our analysis, enhancing the precision and depth of our findings. This allows us to capture subtle variations in clinical outcomes that are not reflected by dichotomous MCID thresholds, thereby providing a better understanding of the impact of body weight variability on knee osteoarthritis progression.

Emerging evidence suggests that the change in body weight might induce metabolic and biomechanical changes that exacerbate osteoarthritis progression. For instance, in overweight and obese women, synovitis progression increased more than 2.5 times with weight gain compared with a stable weight subgroup over 2.5 years. Data from the OAI cohort further highlight significant impacts; patients with consistent weight loss over 72 months reported worsened pain, reduced physical function and increased mobility loss compared with those with stable weight. Moreover, while weight loss may mitigate knee osteoarthritis symptoms, weight gain appears to exacerbate them, and slight weight changes do not significantly affect hip osteoarthritis. Individuals with varying BMI, known as weight cyclers, exhibited significantly greater increases in cartilage and bone marrow abnormalities over 4 years compared with no cyclers, regardless of whether they gained or lost weight. Furthermore, weight changes exceeding 10% were linked to alterations in joint-adjacent subcutaneous fat, though they did not affect cartilage thickness. Together, these findings suggest that weight variability itself may be a distinct risk factor for osteoarthritis progression. Building on this emerging evidence, our study is the first to systematically quantify multiple dimensions of weight variability and demonstrate their associations with both symptomatic and structural outcomes in knee osteoarthritis.

### Association of superficial cartilage transverse relaxation time with osteoarthritis disease progression: data from the foundation for the National Institutes of Health biomarker study of the osteoarthritis initiative [^20909ad8]. Arthritis Care & Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To study whether layer-specific cartilage transverse relaxation time (T2) and/or longitudinal change is associated with clinically relevant knee osteoarthritis (OA) disease progression.

Methods

The Foundation for the National Institutes of Health Biomarker Consortium was a nested case-control study on 600 knees from 600 Osteoarthritis Initiative participants. Progressor knees had both medial tibiofemoral radiographic joint space width (JSW) loss (≥ 0.7mm) and a persistent increase in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) pain score (≥ 9 on a 0–100 scale) at 24–48 months from baseline (n = 194). Multiecho spin-echo (MESE) magnetic resonance images (MRIs) for cartilage T2 analysis had been acquired in the right knees only (97 progressor knees). These were compared to 104 control knees without JSW or pain progression. Fifty-three knees had JSW progression, and 57 pain progression only. Cartilage thickness segmentations obtained from double-echo steady-state MRI were matched to MESE MRI to extract superficial and deep femorotibial cartilage T2. Superficial medial femorotibial compartment (MFTC) T2 at baseline was the primary, and change in deep MFTC T2 between baseline and 12 months was the secondary analytic outcome of this post hoc exploratory study.

Results

Baseline superficial MFTC T2 was significantly elevated in progressor knees (adjusted mean 47.2 msec [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 46.5, 48.0]) and JSW progression only knees (adjusted mean 47.3 msec [95% CI 46.3, 48.3]), respectively, versus non-progressor knees (45.8 msec [95% CI 45.0, 46.5]) after adjustment for age, sex, body mass index, WOMAC pain score, and medial joint space narrowing grade (analysis of covariance). Change in T2 was not significantly associated with case status.

Conclusion

Baseline superficial, but not deep, medial cartilage T2 is associated with clinically relevant disease progression in knee OA.

### Changes in the structural features of osteoarthritis in a year of weight loss [^ff13bc0a]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

In patients undergoing bariatric surgery or medical management for obesity, we assessed whether those experiencing substantial weight loss had changes in innervated knee structures or in cartilage.

Methods

Severely obese patients (body mass index (BMI) ≥ 35) with knee pain on most days were seen before bariatric surgery or medical weight management and at 1-year follow-up. Examinations included 3T MRI acquired at both time points for semi-quantitative scoring of bone marrow lesions (BML), synovitis, cartilage damage, and for quantitative measurement of cartilage thickness. Association of ≥ 20% vs < 20% weight loss with change in semi-quantitative scores was evaluated using linear mixed-effects models, and that with cartilage thickness change used non-parametric and parametric methods. Sensitivity analyses tested different thresholds for weight loss, weight loss as a continuous measure, examined those with and without bariatric surgery, and with worse osteoarthritis (OA).

Results

75 subjects (median age 49 years, 92% women) were included. At baseline, 61 subjects (81%) had Kellgren and Lawrence (KL) grade > 0, and 16 (21%) had KL grade ≥ 3; 69 (92%) had cartilage damage. For BML, synovitis, and cartilage damage, the majority of knees had change in semi-quantitative scores of 0, and there was no difference between those with and without ≥ 20% weight loss. Similarly, in terms of cartilage thickness loss, in 14 of 16 sub-regions thickness loss was not associated with weight loss. Sensitivity analyses showed similar findings.

Conclusion

In middle-aged persons with mostly mild radiographic OA, structural features changed little over a year and weight loss was not associated with effects on structural changes.

Knee osteoarthritis etiology, patient impact, and treatment considerations — osteoarthritis results from an imbalance between breakdown and repair of the tissues in the synovial joint organ and occurs as a result of multiple risk factors including trauma, overuse, and genetic predisposition; patients often complain of joint pain, stiffness, and difficulty with purposeful movement; older adults with self-reported osteoarthritis visit their physicians more frequently and experience greater functional limitations than others in the same age group; the aim of treatment is to provide pain relief and improve the patient's functioning, yet most interventions are associated with some potential for adverse outcomes, especially if invasive or operative, contraindications vary widely by procedure, and reducing risks improves treatment efficacy and is accomplished through collaboration between patient and physician.

### The molecular profile of synovial fluid changes upon joint distraction and is associated with clinical response in knee osteoarthritis [^26835ec3]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Osteoarthritis (OA) affects all joint tissues, with articular cartilage loss being one of the hallmarks of progressive disease. It is likely that excessive mechanical load or loss of mechano-protective mechanisms in the joint is an underlying process in many cases of disease, but that there are other superimposed factors such as inflammation that modify its course. Longitudinal cohorts such as the Osteoarthritis Initiative and Clinical Assessment of the Knee (CAS-K) show that in ∼40% of individuals with early knee OA, pain may stabilise or improve over time, suggesting that the disease may remit and is not inevitably progressive. Interventions that mechanically off-load the joint, such as strengthening exercises, weight loss, orthotics such as bracing or surgical interventions such as osteotomy or unloading devices all reduce knee symptoms.

### What type of exercise is most effective for people with knee osteoarthritis and co-morbid obesity? the TARGET randomized controlled trial [^024bca83]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

Different exercise types may yield different outcomes in osteoarthritis (OA) subgroups. The objective was to directly compare effectiveness of two exercise programs for people with medial knee OA and co-morbid obesity.

Design

We performed a participant- and assessor-blinded randomized controlled trial. 128 people ≥ 50 years with medial knee OA and body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m 2 were recruited from the community. Interventions were home-based non-weight bearing (NWB) quadriceps strengthening or weight bearing (WB) functional exercise for 12 weeks. Primary outcomes were change in overall knee pain (numeric rating scale, range 0–10) and difficulty with physical function (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index, 0–68) over 12 weeks. Secondary outcomes included other pain measures, physical function, quality-of-life, global changes, physical performance, and lower-limb muscle strength.

Results

123 (96%) participants were retained. There was no evidence of a between-group difference in change in pain (mean difference 0.73 units (95% confidence intervals (0.05,1.50)) or function (2.80 units (-1.17,6.76)), with both groups reporting improvements. For secondary outcomes, the WB group had greater improvement in quality-of-life (-0.043 units (-0.085,-0.001)) and more participants reporting global improvement (overall: relative risk 1.40 (0.98,2.01); pain 1.47 (0.97,2.24); function 1.43 (1.04,1.98). Although adverse events were minor, more NWB group participants reported ≥ 1 adverse event (26/66 (39%) vs 14/62 (23%), p = 0.04).

Conclusions

Both exercise types similarly improved primary outcomes of pain and function and can be recommended for people with knee OA and obesity. WB exercise may be preferred given fewer adverse events and potential additional benefits on some secondary outcomes.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the non-surgical management of hip&knee osteoarthritis [^c1bf7935]. VA/DoD (2020). High credibility.

Hip and knee osteoarthritis — weight management and exercise — Providers should refer to the current VA/DoD CPG for the Management of Adult Overweight and Obesity for current evidence-based weight reduction recommendations. Previously published guidelines have established that weight reduction is a cornerstone of non-pharmacologic therapy for the management of hip and/or knee OA, and high-level arthroplasty studies have shown that elevated BMI, in particular BMI ≥ 40 kg/m², is an independent risk factor for developing post-operative peri-prosthetic joint infections. Some patients and providers believe exercise may exacerbate symptoms of OA despite the longstanding recommendation of exercise as one of the core elements in a comprehensive treatment plan.

### Is increased joint loading detrimental to obese patients with knee osteoarthritis? A secondary data analysis from a randomized trial [^2a35b32d]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate whether increased knee joint loading due to improved ambulatory function and walking speed following weight loss achieved over 16 weeks accelerates symptomatic and structural disease progression over a subsequent 1 year weight maintenance period in an obese population with knee osteoarthritis (OA).

Methods

Data from a prospective study of weight loss in obese patients with knee OA (the CARtilage in obese knee OsteoarThritis (CAROT) study) were used to determine changes in knee joint compressive loadings (model estimated) during walking after a successful 16 week weight loss intervention. The participants were divided into 'Unloaders' (participants that reduced joint loads) and 'Loaders' (participants that increased joint loads). The primary symptomatic outcome was changes in knee symptoms, measured with the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) questionnaire, during a subsequent 52 weeks weight maintenance period. The primary structural outcome was changes in tibiofemoral cartilage loss assessed semi-quantitatively (Boston Leeds Knee Osteoarthritis Score (BLOKS) from MRI after the 52 weight maintenance period.

Results

157 participants (82% of the CAROT cohort) with medial and/or lateral knee OA were classified as Unloaders (n = 100) or Loaders (n = 57). The groups showed similar significant changes in symptoms (group difference: -2.4 KOOS points [95% CI -6.8:1.9]) and cartilage loss (group difference: -0.06 BLOKS points [95% CI -0.22:0.11) after 1 year, with no statistically significant differences between Loaders and Unloaders.

Conclusion

For obese patients undergoing a significant weight loss, increased knee joint loading for 1 year was not associated with accelerated symptomatic and structural disease progression compared to a similar weight loss group that had reduced ambulatory compressive knee joint loads.

For diet-only interventions, seven RCTs up to 72 weeks were not associated with a statistically significant impact on pain, despite mean weight loss of 10.5%; however, a smaller RCT (n = 62) with a three-month follow-up found a statistically significant improvement in pain with diet versus control with an average weight loss of 1.7 kg (2%).

Disease course, clinical presentation, and risk factors for osteoarthritis (OA) — OA is diagnosed at a median of 55 years of age, and patients may live approximately 30 years with the disease; patients with symptomatic OA typically present with joint pain, aching, stiffness, and limited walking ability; knee OA is usually bilateral but one knee may be affected more severely, while hip OA is frequently unilateral; OA can progress to severe, disabling pain eventually resulting in structural and functional joint failure; depression and catastrophizing are common, and sleep problems were reported in 72% of adults older than 55 years with OA; patient-level risk factors include older age, female sex, overweight and obesity, genetics, race, and engagement in certain work or recreational activities; weight gain can exacerbate symptoms and for Veterans and active duty Service Members with OA, providers should try to avoid prescription medications that promote weight gain and suggest the use of agents that promote weight loss; heavy work activities or work that requires frequent kneeling, heavy lifting, or repetitive use of joints is associated with the development of OA, and studies also show a strong association between high-impact sports and the development of OA; joint-related factors include previous injury to the knee or hip, knee malalignment, joint shape, increased bone density, knee extensor muscle weakness, joint laxity, joint deformities such as cam deformity and acetabular dysplasia, and abnormal loading of joints, with less well-defined potential risk factors including knee extensor muscle weakness and smoking; there is no cure for OA and overall management is aimed at reducing pain and improving function, and for patients with refractory, disabling pain, the most effective treatment is total joint replacement.

### Do laterally wedged insoles or valgus braces unload the medial compartment of the knee in patients with osteoarthritis? [^a3ac2462]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The results of conservative treatment of knee osteoarthritis (OA) are generally evaluated in epidemiological studies with clinical outcome measures as primary outcomes. Biomechanical evaluation of orthoses shows that there are potentially beneficial biomechanical changes to joint loading; however, evaluation in relation to clinical outcome measures in longitudinal studies is needed.

Questions/Purposes

We asked (1) is there an immediate effect on gait in patients using a laterally wedged insole or valgus knee brace; (2) is there a late (6 weeks) effect; and (3) is there a difference between subgroups within each group with respect to patient compliance, body mass index, and OA status?

Methods

This was a secondary analysis of data from a previous randomized controlled trial of patients with early medial knee OA. A total of 91 patients were enrolled in that trial, and 73 (80%) completed it after 6 months. Of the enrolled patients, 80 (88%) met prespecified inclusion criteria for analysis in the present study. The patients were randomized to an insole or brace. Gait was analyzed with and without wearing the orthosis (insole or brace) at baseline and after 6 weeks. Measurements were taken of the knee adduction moment, ground reaction force, moment arm, walking speed, and toe-out angle. Data were analyzed with regression analyses based on an intention-to-treat principle.

Results

A mean reduction of 4% (± 10) (95% confidence interval [CI] -0.147 to -0.03, p = 0.003) of the peak knee adduction moment and 4% (± 13) (95% CI, -0.009 to -0.001, p = 0.01) of the moment arm at baseline was observed in the insole group when walking with an insole was compared with walking without an insole. A mean reduction of 1% (± 10) (95% CI, -0.002 to -0.001, p = 0.001) of the peak knee adduction moment and no reduction of the moment arm were measured after 6 weeks. No reduction of knee adduction moment, moment arm, or ground reaction force was seen in the brace group at baseline and after 6 weeks. Subgroup analysis showed no differences in biomechanical effect for obesity, stage of OA, and whether patients showed a clinical response to the treatment.

Conclusions

Laterally wedged insoles unload the medial compartment only at baseline in patients with varus alignment and by an amount that might not be clinically important. No biomechanical alteration was seen after 6 weeks of wearing the insole. Valgus brace therapy did not result in any biomechanical alteration. Taken together, this study does not show a clinically relevant biomechanical effect of insole and brace therapy in patients with varus medial knee OA.

### Patella malalignment, pain and patellofemoral progression: the health ABC study [^7f5a9dfb]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

Patellofemoral (PF) joint osteoarthritis (OA) is strongly correlated with lower extremity disability and knee pain. Risk factors for pain and structural progression in PF OA are poorly understood. Our objective was to determine the association between patella malalignment and its relation to pain severity, and PF OA disease progression.

Methods

We conducted an analysis of data from the Health ABC knee OA study. Health ABC is a community based, multi-center cohort study of 3075 Caucasian and Black men and women aged 70–79 at enrollment. Weight bearing skyline knee X-rays were obtained in a subset (595) of subjects, with and without knee pain, at year 2 and year 5 (mean follow-up 36 months). Films were read paired, and PF osteophytes (OST) and joint space narrowing (JSN) were scored on a 0–3 scale using the Osteoarthritis Research Society International atlas. We defined progression of PF OA as any increase in JSN score. Three measures of patella malalignment were made: sulcus angle; patella tilt angle; and patella subluxation medially or laterally (bisect offset). Knee symptoms were assessed using a knee specific Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) knee pain subscale. We assessed the relationship between baseline patella malalignment and pain severity (linear regression for WOMAC) and compartment specific PF OA progression (logistic regression for dichotomous outcomes). We classified continuous measures of patella alignment into quartile groups. We performed multivariable adjusted logistic regression models, including age, gender and body mass index (BMI) to assess the relation of baseline patella alignment to the occurrence of PF JSN progression using generalized estimating equations (GEE).

Results

The subjects had a mean age 73.6 (SD 2.9), BMI 28.8 (SD 4.9), 40.3% male, and 46% were Black. Medial displacement of the patella predisposed to medial JSN progression; odds for each quartile 1, 1.2, 1.2, 2.2 (P for trend = 0.03), whilst protecting from lateral JSN progression; odds for each quartile 1, 0.7, 0.6, 0.4 (P for trend = 0.0004). Increasing patella tilt protected from medial JSN progression; odds for each quartile 1, 0.8, 0.5, 0.2 (P < 0.0001) and trended to increasing pain severity (P = 0.09).

Conclusion

Patella malalignment is associated with PF disease progression. Medial displacement and tilt of the patella predisposes to medial JSN progression, whilst lateral displacement is predictive of lateral JSN progression. The influence of patella malalignment has important implications since it is potentially modifiable through footwear, taping and/or knee bracing.

### Early failure of minimally invasive unicompartmental knee arthroplasty is associated with obesity [^e9647d47]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2005). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

There has been increasing use of and expanding indications for unicompartmental knee arthroplasty using minimally invasive techniques. We sought to define contraindications by examining failures. We retrospectively reviewed the early results of a consecutive series of minimally invasive medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasty using two implant designs. Seventy-nine consecutive unicompartmental knee arthroplasty cases (48 instrumented and 31 noninstrumented) with minimum 2-year followup were reviewed. Patients with radiographic involvement with or without pain referable to the lateral compartment or to the patellofemoral joint were not considered candidates. Failure was defined as revision or pending revision. The average followup was 40.2 months. There were 16 failures (six tibial loosening, three plateau fracture, four persistent medial pain, one progressive arthritis, and two sepsis). Age, gender, disease severity and implant design did not predict failure. Body mass index greater than 32 did predict failure and was associated with a reduction in survivorship by log-rank and Wilcoxon analyses. These results show reliable success if obesity is considered a contraindication and technical errors resulting in fracture are eliminated. Better defining the ideal candidate for unicompartmental knee arthroplasty, with obesity remaining a contraindication, will make this a more predictable and reliable procedure.

### External knee adduction and flexion moments during gait and medial tibiofemoral disease progression in knee osteoarthritis [^dc182623]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Test the hypothesis that greater baseline peak external knee adduction moment (KAM), KAM impulse, and peak external knee flexion moment (KFM) during the stance phase of gait are associated with baseline-to-2-year medial tibiofemoral cartilage damage and bone marrow lesion progression, and cartilage thickness loss.

Methods

Participants all had knee OA in at least one knee. Baseline peak KAM, KAM impulse, and peak KFM (normalized to body weight and height) were captured and computed using a motion analysis system and 6 force plates. Participants underwent MRI of both knees at baseline and two years later. To assess the association between baseline moments and baseline-to-2-year semiquantitative cartilage damage and bone marrow lesion progression and quantitative cartilage thickness loss, we used logistic regression with generalized estimating equations (GEE), adjusting for gait speed, age, gender, disease severity, knee pain severity, and medication use.

Results

The sample consisted of 391 knees (204 persons): mean age 64.2 years (SD 10.0); BMI 28.4 kg/m² (5.7); 156 (76.5%) women. Greater baseline peak KAM and KAM impulse were each associated with worsening of medial bone marrow lesions, but not cartilage damage. Higher baseline KAM impulse was associated with 2-year medial cartilage thickness loss assessed both as % loss and as a threshold of loss, whereas peak KAM was related only to % loss. There was no relationship between baseline peak KFM and any medial disease progression outcome measures.

Conclusion

Findings support targeting KAM parameters in an effort to delay medial OA disease progression.

### Evaluation of patients presenting with knee pain: part I. history… [^3b5102bd]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

Knee pain accounts for approximately one third of musculoskeletal problems seen in primary care settings. This complaint is most prevalent in physically active patients, with as many as 54 percent of athletes having some degree of knee pain each year. 1 Knee pain can be a source of significant disability, restricting the ability to work or perform activities of daily living. The knee is a complex structure, 2 and its evaluation can present a challenge to the family physician. The differential diagnosis of knee pain is extensive but can be narrowed with a detailed history, a focused physical examination and, when indicated, the selective use of appropriate imaging and laboratory studies. Part I of this two-part article provides a systematic approach to evaluating the knee, and part II 3 discusses the differential diagnosis of knee pain. History PAIN CHARACTERISTICS The patient's description of knee pain is helpful in focusing the differential diagnosis.

4 It is important to clarify the characteristics of the pain, including its onset, location, duration, severity, and quality. Aggravating and alleviating factors also need to be identified. If knee pain is caused by an acute injury, the physician needs to know whether the patient was able to continue activity or bear weight after the injury or was forced to cease activities immediately. MECHANICAL SYMPTOMS The patient should be asked about mechanical symptoms, such as locking, popping, or giving way of the knee. A history of locking episodes suggests a meniscal tear. A sensation of popping at the time of injury suggests ligamentous injury, probably complete rupture of a ligament. Episodes of giving way are consistent with some degree of knee instability and may indicate patellar subluxation or ligamentous rupture.

EFFUSION The timing and amount of joint effusion are important clues to the diagnosis. Rapid onset of a large, tense effusion suggests rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament or fracture of the tibial plateau with resultant hemarthrosis, whereas slower onset of a mild to moderate effusion is consistent with meniscal injury or ligamentous sprain. Recurrent knee effusion after activity is consistent with meniscal injury. MECHANISM OF INJURY The patient should be questioned about specific details of the injury. It is important to know if the patient sustained a direct blow to the knee, if the foot was planted at the time of injury, if the patient was decelerating or stopping suddenly, if the patient was landing from a jump, if there was a twisting component to the injury, and if hyperextension occurred. A direct blow to the knee can cause serious injury. Anterior force applied to the proximal tibia with the knee in flexion can cause injury to the posterior cruciate ligament. The medial collateral ligament is most commonly injured as a result of direct lateral force to the knee; this force creates a valgus load on the knee joint and can result in rupture of the medial collateral ligament. Conversely, a medial blow that creates a varus load can injure the lateral collateral ligament. Noncontact forces also are an important cause of knee injury. Quick stops and sharp cuts or turns create significant deceleration forces that can sprain or rupture the anterior cruciate ligament. Hyperextension can result in injury to the anterior cruciate ligament or posterior cruciate ligament. Sudden twisting or pivoting motions create shear forces that can injure the meniscus. A combination of forces can occur simultaneously, causing injury to multiple structures. MEDICAL HISTORY A history of knee injury or surgery is important.

### Multimodal treatment patterns for osteoarthritis and their relationship to patient-reported pain severity: a cross-sectional survey in the United States [^9a000b16]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis in the United States (US), and its prevalence is increasing. Pain is the hallmark symptom of OA, often driving individuals to seek medical attention and contributing to functional limitations, reducing quality of life, and increasing the overall healthcare burden. Joint pain in OA is complex and incompletely understood, particularly as pain does not consistently correlate with observed structural joint damage. It can be a product of multiple factors, including peripheral/central sensitization and individual patient characteristics. These factors can further complicate the treatment of OA.

As OA can involve multiple joints and is progressive in nature, treatment is often dynamic and long term. Clinical guidelines for the management of OA are joint-specific and increasingly personalized, taking into account each patient's comorbidity profile, concerns, goals, and personal situation. Treatment for OA is generally focused on alleviating pain and reducing functional impairment through nonpharmacologic, pharmacologic, and surgical interventions.

The data in the presented treatment analysis were collected in 2017 as part of the Adelphi Disease Specific Programme (DSP). At the time, both the Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI), and American College of Rheumatology (ACR)guidelines for the nonsurgical management of hip and knee OA strongly recommended aerobic/resistance land-based exercise, water-based exercise, and weight loss (for overweight patients only) as appropriate nonpharmacologic therapies. This was to be conducted alongside the receipt of medications, if required, including acetaminophen (for those without comorbidities), oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs [for those without comorbidities]; preferably topical for the knee), and intra-articular corticosteroids. A number of other nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic approaches are recommended in each of these guidelines.

### Knee pain and mobility impairments: meniscal and articular cartilage lesions revision 2018 [^3256b842]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2018). Medium credibility.

Meniscal injury risks — medial meniscus posterior root tears and osteoarthritis risk are linked to patient factors and injury history, and delay to anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction is associated with medial meniscus injury at surgery. Posterior root tears were associated with higher body mass index (greater than 30 kg/m²) alongside other factors. Any history of meniscus tear was highly predictive (OR = 5.7) of developing radiographic tibiofemoral osteoarthritis. In a registry of 1252 patients, time from injury to ACL reconstruction greater than 12 months increased the risk of medial meniscus injury at the time of ACL reconstruction.

### Unloader knee braces for osteoarthritis: do patients actually wear them? [^75d536bf]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Unloader braces are a nonsurgical approach for predominantly unicompartmental knee arthritis. Although noninvasive, braces are expensive and it is unclear whether clinical factors, if any, will predict regular brace use.

Questions/Purposes

We asked: (1) Do patients continue to use the unloader brace more than 1 year after it is prescribed? (2) Do any clinical or radiographic factors predict continued use of the unloader brace after the first year? (3) What are the most common subjective reasons that patients give for discontinuing the brace?

Methods

We administered 110 surveys to all patients who were fitted for unloader knee braces for predominantly unicompartmental osteoarthritis 12 to 40 months before administration of the survey. Standardized indications and fitting protocols were used. The following parameters were tested for association with ongoing brace use: alignment, arthritis severity, compartment involved, BMI, weight, age, gender, pain and function, number of refittings, and problems with the brace. The survey response rate was 81% (89 of 110).

Results

Of the 89 responders, 28% reported regular brace use (twice per week, an hour at a time, or more); at 2 years, 25% used the brace regularly. No clinical or radiographic factors considered were associated with ongoing brace use. Patients reported lack of symptomatic relief, brace discomfort, poor fit, and skin irritation as reasons for discontinuing the brace.

Conclusions

Surgeons and patients need to balance the benefits and absence of complications of bracing against cost and the low likelihood of ongoing use 1 year or more after the prescription of the brace.

### What is the evidence for a role for diet and nutrition in osteoarthritis? [^22cfb437]. Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Physical activity as an adjunct to weight reduction

Reducing adipose tissue while maintaining muscle mass is advantageous in OA, particularly for mobility. Physical activity generates changes in white adipose tissue, including increased mitochondrial biogenesis and an altered adipokine profile, and hence weight reduction programmes that combine diet and exercise have the most benefit on functional status, joint imaging and visual analogue scale pain. Meta-analysis indicates that interventions combining strengthening, flexibility and aerobic exercise are most likely to improve pain and function. However, caloric restriction is still integral, as highlighted in a trial in which knee compressive forces were lowest in a diet group and inflammation (IL-6) was lowest in a diet-and-exercise group, compared with exercise alone (Table 2).

Effective weight management

Weight reduction and maintenance of an optimal weight is challenging, particularly when mobility is impaired. Activity should be tailored to the mobility, co-morbidities and preferences of the individual. Successful weight reduction interventions may incorporate dietitian input. In clinical practice, behaviour-change strategies, increased contact and follow-up will improve adherence to weight-management programmes.

Conclusions on obesity and weight reduction in OA

Weight reduction in overweight or obese OA patients reduces joint impact and injurious loading, improves inflammatory adipokine secretion patterns and positively affects metabolic-risk profile. Effective dietary interventions do not deviate greatly from general weight-management guidelines. Guidance is given in Table 3.

T3
Summary of dietary interventions that may be of benefit in OA

Polyunsaturated fatty acids

Dietary-lipid modification in OA

Lipids are stored in the matrix and chondrocytes of articular cartilage and may contribute towards inflammation, cartilage degradation and impaired chondrocyte structure. OA joints accumulate high levels of omega-6 (n -6) fatty acids, precursors of pro-inflammatory eicosanoids. In individuals with, or at high risk of, knee OA, a positive association was seen between the n -6 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) arachidonic acid (AA) and synovitis but an inverse relationship between total plasma n -3 PUFA, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and patellofemoral cartilage loss, as measured by MRI. With diet influencing systemic lipid levels, it is plausible that dietary manipulation could affect articular-cartilage composition and structural damage in knee OA. A large prospective study in OA patients found that higher intakes of total and saturated fat were associated with increased knee joint space-width loss, whereas higher intakes of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) and PUFAs were associated with reduced radiographic progression.

### Non-surgical management of knee osteoarthritis: where are we now and where do we need to go? [^82af870c]. RMD Open (2015). Low credibility.

Figure 1
Treatments considered 'Appropriate' in at least one of the four subphenotypes of knee osteoarthritis. Quality of evidence is indicated by: bold = good; not bold = fair. NSAIDs, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug. * knee braces, knee sleeves, foot orthoses and lateral wedge insoles.

Excess weight and obesity are well-known risk factors for OA since they increase mechanical stress and induce systemic effects (eg, via adipokines and/or hyperglycaemia) involved in OA pathogenesis. It has been recently confirmed that in knee OA, mechanical stress is the most important underlying mechanism; this is in contrast to hand OA, where systemic processes appear to be most important. In line with this are results of a meta-analysis published in July 2014 indicating that knee OA risk increases almost exponentially according to the increase in body mass index (BMI). Furthermore, analysis of data available through the Osteoarthritis Initiative and the CHECK-cohort confirmed that individuals with higher BMI experience greater pain from knee OA than individuals with lower BMI, even when taking into account OA severity. Therefore, successful management of knee OA includes reduction of adverse mechanical factors (ie, weight loss in patients who are overweight or obese). Exercise is also beneficial, as shown in a recently published randomised controlled trial in women with OA of the knee. Progressive resistance exercise reduced pain, improved function, increased strength and showed benefits on some quality of life domains. However, apart from these approaches and education about the disease, there is little to offer patients for prevention or early treatment that is directed at the cause of the disease.

### Association of superficial cartilage transverse relaxation time with osteoarthritis disease progression: data from the foundation for the National Institutes of Health biomarker study of the osteoarthritis initiative [^63345c0f]. Arthritis Care & Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To study whether layer‐specific cartilage transverse relaxation time (T2) and/or longitudinal change is associated with clinically relevant knee osteoarthritis (OA) disease progression.

Methods

The Foundation for the National Institutes of Health Biomarker Consortium was a nested case–control study on 600 knees from 600 Osteoarthritis Initiative participants. Progressor knees had both medial tibiofemoral radiographic joint space width (JSW) loss (≥ 0.7 mm) and a persistent increase in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) pain score (≥ 9 on a 0–100 scale) at 24–48 months from baseline (n = 194). Multiecho spin‐echo (MESE) magnetic resonance images (MRIs) for cartilage T2 analysis had been acquired in the right knees only (97 progressor knees). These were compared to 104 control knees without JSW or pain progression. Fifty‐three knees had JSW progression, and 57 pain progression only. Cartilage thickness segmentations obtained from double‐echo steady‐state MRI were matched to MESE MRI to extract superficial and deep femorotibial cartilage T2. Superficial medial femorotibial compartment (MFTC) T2 at baseline was the primary, and change in deep MFTC T2 between baseline and 12 months was the secondary analytic outcome of this post hoc exploratory study.

Results

Baseline superficial MFTC T2 was significantly elevated in progressor knees (adjusted mean 47.2 msec [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 46.5, 48.0]) and JSW progression only knees (adjusted mean 47.3 msec [95% CI 46.3, 48.3]), respectively, versus non‐progressor knees (45.8 msec [95% CI 45.0, 46.5]) after adjustment for age, sex, body mass index, WOMAC pain score, and medial joint space narrowing grade (analysis of covariance). Change in T2 was not significantly associated with case status.

Conclusion

Baseline superficial, but not deep, medial cartilage T2 is associated with clinically relevant disease progression in knee OA.

### Knee pain in adults and adolescents: the initial evaluation | AAFP… [^70689302]. AAFP (2018). Low credibility.

History When evaluating knee pain, key aspects of the patient history include age; location, onset, duration, and quality of pain; mechanical or systemic symptoms; history of swelling; description of any precipitating trauma; and pertinent previous medical or surgical procedures. Patients requiring urgent referral generally have severe pain, immediate swelling, and instability or inability to bear weight in association with acute trauma, which suggests fracture, dislocation, or tendon or ligamentous rupture. Referral is also indicated for possible joint infection signs such as fever, swelling, and erythema with limited range of motion. PAIN LOCATION Anterior. Isolated anterior knee pain suggests involvement of the patella, patellar tendon, or its attachments. Anterior knee pain that is dull or aching and exacerbated by prolonged sitting or climbing stairs is common in patellofemoral pain syndrome.

3, 18 Athletes or other adults with overuse from running or jumping sports can develop quadriceps or patellar tendinopathy. Insidious onset of anterior knee pain in adolescents during rapid growth periods with concomitant overuse suggests Osgood-Schlatter disease or Sinding-Larsen-Johansson syndrome. Prepatellar bursitis causes patella-localized pain and swelling and can occur with isolated blunt trauma, repetitive injury, or infection of the overlying skin.
18. Medial or Lateral. Medial or lateral knee pain with corresponding joint-line tenderness can result from acute injury or chronic overuse and may indicate meniscal derangement or a sprain or rupture of a collateral ligament. 3, 18 Pes anserine bursitis is a common cause of medial knee pain instigated by overuse or blunt injury; the pain is exacerbated by flexion and extension of the knee.

Adolescents experiencing medial knee pain with or without concurrent hip pain should be evaluated for slipped capital femoral epiphysis, caused by a fracture through the femoral physis. 26 Chronic lateral knee pain in runners or cyclists is a common presentation of iliotibial band syndrome.
3. Posterior. Isolated posterior knee pain is less common but may occur from a symptomatic popliteal cyst. 3, 28 Posterior knee pain after acute trauma raises suspicion for injury of the posterior cruciate ligament and posterior portions of the meniscus, quadriceps tendons, or neurovascular structures. 28 Chronic posterior knee pain can suggest hamstring tendinopathy.
28. Diffuse.

Chronic, diffuse knee pain in adults older than 50 years is commonly attributable to degenerative knee osteoarthritis, particularly when the pain is worse at the end of the day, is exacerbated by weight-bearing activity, and is relieved by rest. 20 Acute onset of diffuse atraumatic knee pain may indicate an infectious etiology, gout, or rheumatoid arthritis; the latter is especially suspected when the pain is bilateral or when it occurs simultaneously in other joints. In adolescents, atraumatic or unexplained diffuse knee pain that worsens with activity warrants imaging to assess for osteochondrosis 8; similar pain that persists at rest or that worsens at night should raise suspicion for malignancy.
26. MECHANICAL SYMPTOMS Mechanical symptoms, such as locking, buckling, or catching, suggest internal derangement and possible instability but can also occur in medial plica syndrome 18.

### Knee osteoarthritis worsening across the disease spectrum and future knee pain, symptoms, and functioning: a multisite prospective cohort study [^45b9dc00]. Arthritis Care & Research (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Prognostic estimates for knee osteoarthritis worsening over the full disease spectrum have not been reported. Osteoarthritis Initiative data were used to determine the association between knee radiographic osteoarthritis worsening and future knee pain and function.

Methods

Yearly data over a 5-year period were analyzed. Outcome measures were the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index and the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score pain and symptoms scales. Knees were grouped based on whether yearly Kellgren/Lawrence (K/L) grades worsened. Associations of yearly K/L worsening with knee pain, symptoms, or function scores at the end of the year and with lagged outcomes observed at least 1 year after worsening were assessed using linear models with generalized estimating equations.

Results

A total of 25,932 knee-years of observations were examined in the primary analysis. For knees with yearly K/L worsening, all outcome scores were significantly worse (P values from 0.02 to < 0.001) at the end of the index year, as compared to unchanged knees. All outcomes for knees with worsened versus unchanged K/L scores exceeded the minimal clinically important difference (MCID). For lagged effects, outcomes at 1 year following the index K/L year exceeded the MCID and were statistically significant (P ≤ 0.001) for knees with baseline K/L grades of 2 or 3.

Conclusion

K/L worsening over a 1-year period is prognostically important over the short term for all baseline K/L grades, and for knees with baseline K/L grades of 2 or 3 worsening continues over the following year.

### A geriatrician's approach to managing the complex older adult with obesity [^5537fd5d]. Obesity (2025). Medium credibility.

Older adults with obesity have varying levels of mobility disability interfering with their ability to participate in ILI and perform activities of daily living, leading to increased use of assistive devices. Adiposity and its deleterious effects on muscle composition lead to low muscle strength, which further leads to functional impairment and mobility disability. Increasing obesity severity has been shown to be associated with worsening pain, functional limitation, and disability, predisposing individuals to homebound status. Enhancing access to care by extending options for both in‐person and telehealth visits to patients with increasing mobility disability but with normal cognition could be a meaningful age‐ and obesity‐friendly approach. This has been successfully demonstrated in a feasibility study on a rural, underserved population. Focusing on the mobility component of the 4Ms approach to care for this group would require an evidence‐based rehabilitation program with early referral to physical therapy or an exercise physiologist, as well as pain management with pharmacological and/or nonpharmacological strategies. Clinical decision‐making regarding the choice of pain medication should take into consideration the weight‐promoting, detrimental effect of the neuropathic agents such as gabapentin and pregabalin, further leading to worsening OA and exacerbating the vicious cycle.

The importance of weight loss to improve OA in both the knees and hips warrants emphasis, as 1% weight loss can reduce the risk of knee replacement by 2% and hip replacement by 3%. Weight loss also helps improve OA pain and function and reduce disability. There is evidence that GLP‐1 agents may play a role in slowing degenerative arthritis by modulating inflammation and promoting cartilage repair. An interesting yet conflicting scenario is that patients with severe obesity, i.e. BMI > 40, awaiting total knee arthroplasty are prescribed a weight‐loss goal of BMI < 40 or < 35 as a prerequisite for surgery, which is often unattainable with ILI alone. Enabling patients to embark on a multicomponent comprehensive obesity intervention, encompassing management of pain and psychosocial conditions along with AOMs if appropriate, could help patients undergo long‐awaited major joint surgeries for conditions that have been impacting their mobility and function, thereby helping to improve quality of life.

Fall risk mitigation should take into consideration the underlying orthopedic and foot issues and consider appropriate referral to orthopedics and podiatry. The emphasis should be on resistance and strength training exercise, balance, and aerobic fitness.

### Quantifying sustained pain worsening in knee osteoarthritis [^df6730d8]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Recent work suggests that many persons with knee osteoarthritis (OA) experience stable symptoms over time. Whether patients experience periods of symptom exacerbation or flare which interrupt this stable course, and how long such periods last, has received little study. Our objective is to describe the frequency and duration of episodes of pain worsening in persons with knee OA.

Methods

We selected participants from the Osteoarthritis Initiative with radiographic, symptomatic knee OA. We defined a clinically relevant increase in knee pain as an increase in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) pain of ≥ 9 points. We defined sustained worsening as maintaining at least 80% of the initial increase. We used Poisson regression to estimate the incidence rate (IR) of episodes of pain worsening.

Results

1093 participants were included in the analysis. Eighty-eight percent had ≥ 1 increase in WOMAC pain ≥ 9 points (IR: 26.3 per 100 person years (95% CI: 25.2, 27.4)). Forty-eight percent had ≥ 1 episode of sustained worsening (IR: 9.7 per 100 person-years (95% CI: 8.9, 10.5)). Elevated pain was maintained an average of 2.4 years after the initial increase.

Conclusion

Most participants with knee OA reported at least one clinically relevant increase in WOMAC pain, but fewer than half experienced an episode of sustained pain worsening. These individual-level data portray a more nuanced and fluctuating course of OA pain than suggested by trajectory studies. These data could be useful in shared decision-making regarding prognosis and treatment choices in persons affected by symptomatic knee OA.

### Does weight loss reduce the incidence of total knee and hip replacement for osteoarthritis? – A prospective cohort study among middle-aged and older adults with overweight or obesity [^8f2003fb]. International Journal of Obesity (2021). Medium credibility.

Obesity is a well-recognised risk factor for the development and progression of OA, and likely contributes to the need for total joint replacement. A recent meta-analysis found that people with obesity had a 4.6-fold greater risk of developing OA compared to people with healthy weight. People with excess weight are more likely to progress to an advanced stage of OA, with estimates suggesting that 80–95% of people needing a total joint replacement also had overweight or obesity. Considering the strong link between obesity and increased risk of OA as well as total joint replacement, all clinical guidelines for OA management around the world recommend weight loss as a core strategy for all OA patients with overweight and obesity. However, few studies have assessed and quantified the clinical benefits of weight loss for OA. A systematic review and meta-analysis of four randomised controlled trials showed a statistically significant effect of weight loss to reduce pain and disability in people with knee OA, but it was unclear whether these statistically significant changes were of sufficient magnitude to be clinically significant. Indeed, the meta-analysis suggested that a loss of 5% of initial weight within a 20-week period is required to obtain moderate symptomatic relief. In contrast to these studies on knee OA, there are no studies investigating the specific effects of weight loss on hip OA. More importantly, for both knee and hip OA, it remains unclear whether weight loss reduces the risk for TKR and THR in the long term. Therefore, the objective of this longitudinal study was to investigate the association of weight loss recommended by current guidelines and the risk of TKR and THR due to OA among middle-aged and older adults with overweight or obesity.

### Body composition is associated with changes in health-related quality of life in patients with knee and / or hip osteoarthritis [^a43e4eea]. RMD Open (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Obesity is one of the most well-documented risk factors for the incidence and structural progression of knee osteoarthritis (OA)and, to a lesser extent, hip OA. A high body mass index (BMI) has also been associated with worsening pain and physical function in knee OA. In contrast, associations are variable in hip OA.

In these studies, obesity is defined as a BMI ≥ 30. However, BMI, calculated from total weight, does not distinguish between muscle, bone and adipose tissue compartments, while a significant variation in visceral adiposity is observed at any given BMI. The reduction in body fat is actually more closely related to symptomatic relief in knee OA than is the loss of body weight.

Moreover, sarcopenic obesity has more often been associated with the presence of knee OA than non-sarcopenic obesity in patients of comparable weight. However, high muscle mass was not a protective factor of incidence or aggravation of symptomatic knee OA.

While body composition, particularly fat measures, are associated with pain, analyses to date have been primarily cross-sectional. Only two recent studies have explored the longitudinal impact of central obesity or metabolic syndrome on OA pain. Li et al showed that visceral adiposity was associated with knee pain severity and widespread pain in patients with or at risk for knee OA. Pan et al found that metabolic syndrome was associated with worse pain progression because of central obesity.

Furthermore, the consequences of OA go far beyond pain and associations between body composition and other health-related quality of life (HRQoL) dimensions deserve further attention, especially associations with physical function, vitality and mental health, which are also impacted by OA. Measures of body composition or fat distribution are related to metabolic and inflammatory factors and may be associated with changes in perceived health. In recent years, links have been established between adipokines released by adipose tissue and the central nervous system. Increased inflammation and oxidative stress could disrupt the blood-brain barrier permeability and act on different brain structures. Leptin or adiponectin (decreased in patients with obesity) has been shown to have antidepressant effects.

### Association of weight gain with incident knee pain, stiffness, and functional difficulties: a longitudinal study [^3bc37c3e]. Arthritis Care & Research (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine the longitudinal association between significant weight change and change in knee symptoms (pain, stiffness, and function), and to determine whether the effects differ in those who are obese and those with osteoarthritis (OA).

Methods

Two hundred fifty subjects ranging from normal weight to obese (body mass index range 16.9–59.1 kg/m²) and no significant musculoskeletal disease were recruited from the general community and weight loss clinics and organizations. Seventy-eight percent were followed at ~2 years. Weight, height, and knee symptoms (using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index) were assessed at baseline and followup. Any weight loss methods were recorded.

Results

Thirty percent of subjects lost ≥ 5% of baseline weight, 56% of subjects' weight remained stable (loss or gain of < 5% of baseline weight), and 14% of subjects gained ≥ 5% of baseline weight. Using estimated marginal means, weight gain was associated with worsening pain (mean 27.1 mm; 95% confidence interval [95% CI] -1.1, 55.2), stiffness (mean 18.4 mm; 95% CI 1.5, 35.3), and function (mean 99.3 mm; 95% CI 4.0, 194.6) compared to stable weight. Weight loss was associated with reduced pain (mean -22.4 mm; 95% CI -44.4, -0.3), stiffness (mean -15.3 mm; 95% CI -28.50, -2.0), and function (mean -73.2 mm; 95% CI -147.9, 1.3) compared to stable weight.

Conclusion

Weight gain was associated with adverse effects on knee symptoms, particularly in those who are obese and who have OA. Although losing weight is potentially beneficial for symptom improvement, the effects were more modest. Avoiding weight gain is important in managing knee symptoms.

Secondary outcomes and adverse events

The occurrence of radiographic progression was assessed from the change in joint space width (i.e. joint space narrowing) after 68 weeks. Only paired images fully valid for interpretation by decision of the radiologist were analyzed, without any statistically significant differences between groups. Among all the other secondary outcomes, some were explored in more detail according to the prespecified statistical analysis plan. When we explored in greater depth the differences in weight loss across groups (P = 0.002 by ANCOVA), this finding was supported by the anthropometric measures from DXA scans of whole body composition in terms of loss of fat mass (P = 0.001 by ANCOVA), but not in loss of lean body mass (P = 0.65 by ANCOVA). The diet group lost significantly more fat mass than did both the control group (−3006.8 gm [−5247.7, −765.8 gm]; P = 0.0088) and the exercise group (−4188.2 gm [−1934.0, −6442.4 gm]; P = 0.0003). In contrast, there was no statistically significant difference in loss of fat mass between the exercise and control groups (P = 0.30). As presented in Table 2, there was no statistical difference between the loss in lean body mass between the diet and control groups (P = 0.62), diet and exercise groups (P = 0.67), or exercise and control groups (P = 0.36). Table 3 presents all the adverse events, from mild to moderate, reported in each group from week 16 through week 68. No clinically important events or changes in laboratory tests were seen in any of the groups (data not shown).

### The intensive diet and exercise for arthritis (IDEA) trial: 18-month radiographic and MRI outcomes [^2218c9a6]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

Report the radiographic and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) structural outcomes of an 18-month study of diet-induced weight loss, with or without exercise, compared to exercise alone in older, overweight and obese adults with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis (OA).

Methods

Prospective, single-blind, randomized controlled trial that enrolled 454 overweight and obese (body mass index, BMI = 27–41 kg/m²) older (age ≥ 55 yrs) adults with knee pain and radiographic evidence of femorotibial OA. Participants were randomized to one of three 18-month interventions: diet-induced weight loss only (D); diet-induced weight loss plus exercise (D + E); or exercise-only control (E). X-rays (N = 325) and MRIs (N = 105) were acquired at baseline and 18 months follow-up. X-ray and MRI (cartilage thickness and semi-quantitative (SQ)) results were analyzed to compare change between groups at 18-month follow-up using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) adjusted for baseline values, baseline BMI, and gender.

Results

Mean baseline descriptive characteristics of the cohort included: age, 65.6 yrs; BMI 33.6 kg/m²; 72% female; 81% white. There was no significant difference between groups in joint space width (JSW) loss; D -0.07 (SE 0.22) mm, D + E -0.27 (SE 0.22) mm and E -0.16 (SE 0.24) mm (P = 0.79). There was also no significant difference in MRI cartilage loss between groups; D -0.10(0.05) mm, D + E -0.13(0.04) mm and E -0.05(0.04) mm (P = 0.42).

Conclusion

Despite the potent effects of weight loss in this study on symptoms as well as mechanistic outcomes (such as joint compressive force and markers of inflammation), there was no statistically significant difference between the three active interventions on the rate of structural progression either on X-ray or MRI over 18-months.

Subgroup analyses

The impact of body weight variability on knee pain and JSL was further examined across different BMI and weight change status, which encompassed BMI subgroups (normal weight, overweight and obese) and weight change subgroups (weight neutral, weight loss and weight gain). The proportion of increased knee pain and JSL events between low and high body weight variability levels was compared across these subgroups. Notably, knees in the weight gain subgroup with high body weight variability exhibited a greater proportion of increased pain (online supplemental figure S2).

In people with normal body weight at baseline, high body weight variability (≥ median) was not associated with knee pain level at 48 months. High weight variability showed an increasing risk for osteoarthritis pain progression in the overweight group, which is comparable to those observed in the obese group. We combined the overweight and obese subgroups, yielding consistent effects (adjusted ORs: ASV 1.30, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.62, rASV 1.27, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.70). For JSL, we did not observe any such association as assessed by ASV, rASV and the other metrics (table 3, online supplemental table S2). No consistent significant interaction was found between baseline BMI and body weight variability.

Table 3
Body weight variability and risk of outcomes in different baseline BMI groups

Among people with weight change statuses of weight neutral and weight loss, we cannot see a consistent association between the outcomes (joint pain increase or JSL) and body weight variability assessed by ASV, rASV or other metrics (table 4 and online supplemental table S2). However, in people with weight gain, high variability in body weight (as assessed by ASV, rASV, SD and CV) was associated with an increased risk of worsening knee pain (continuous and dichotomised) compared with those with low body weight variability. For JSL, among people who experienced weight gain, high body weight variability was only linked to JSL when assessed using the SD and CV metrics (see table 4 and online supplemental table S2).

Potential benefits, harm, and contraindications — individuals with osteoarthritis of the knee often report joint pain, stiffness, and difficulty with purposeful movement; the aim of treatment is to provide pain relief and improve the patient's functioning. Most interventions are associated with some potential for adverse outcomes, especially if invasive or operative, contraindications vary widely by procedure, and reducing risks is accomplished through collaboration between patient and physician; current research does not differentiate between the sexes, and future work may clarify how a patient's sex alters treatment benefits and harms.
