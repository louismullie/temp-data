## Question

what are the latest treatment guidelines in t2d

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the latest treatment guidelines for type 2 diabetes. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the foundational principles that anchor current care. Then, I should verify first-line pharmacotherapy and when to start it. Next, I will examine risk stratification and the role of SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists. After that, I need to check combination therapy strategies and insulin indications. I will then consider special populations, glycemic targets, and lifestyle/SDOH integration. Finally, I should review implementation gaps and synthesize a practical decision framework, ensuring each step aligns with high-credibility guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the foundational principles guiding therapy today, because if I misstate these, downstream choices will be off. Contemporary guidelines emphasize a patient-centered, comorbidity-driven approach that prioritizes cardiorenal risk reduction, weight management, and avoidance of hypoglycemia, moving beyond a purely glycemia-centric model, with shared decision-making embedded throughout [^113aJx7e] [^113pBd7W] [^111zf863].

> I need to verify first-line pharmacotherapy and timing. Metformin remains the preferred initial agent for most adults with type 2 diabetes unless contraindicated or not tolerated, owing to durable A1C lowering, low hypoglycemia risk, weight neutrality or loss, favorable safety profile, and cost-effectiveness; importantly, ADA 2025 supports initiating metformin at diagnosis alongside lifestyle measures and continuing it as long as tolerated [^114yCGpj] [^112gSxmS]. Hold on, I should double-check the timing point: yes, ADA 2025 explicitly supports early initiation with lifestyle, and Canadian guidance similarly recommends metformin as initial therapy once pharmacotherapy is indicated, reinforcing this approach [^111qNBNG].

> Next, I should review risk stratification because it drives the addition of SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists. For adults with established ASCVD, heart failure, or CKD, guidelines recommend adding an SGLT-2 inhibitor and/or GLP-1 RA with proven cardiovascular benefit independent of baseline A1C, given robust reductions in major adverse cardiovascular events, heart failure hospitalizations, and kidney outcomes; this is a strong, risk-stratified recommendation across ADA/EASD and ESC documents [^113aJx7e] [^113ayVRd]. Wait, let me verify the strength of evidence: the BMJ 2021 guideline provides risk-stratified recommendations using GRADE and supports SGLT-2 inhibitors particularly when both CVD and CKD are present, aligning with this approach [^112VEpub].

> I will now examine combination therapy, because delaying intensification worsens outcomes. ADA 2025 supports initial combination therapy in appropriate adults to shorten time to individualized goals, particularly when A1C is significantly above target or cardiorenal risk is high; this counters therapeutic inertia and leverages complementary mechanisms [^116WNWFw]. Let me consider the practical pairing: metformin plus an SGLT-2 inhibitor or GLP-1 RA is a common evidence-aligned strategy that addresses glycemia, weight, and cardiorenal endpoints simultaneously, consistent with ADA/EASD consensus [^113aJx7e].

> Now, I should confirm insulin indications and how to integrate it with noninsulin agents. Insulin is indicated for symptomatic hyperglycemia, very high A1C (generally > 10% or > 86 mmol/mol), or fasting glucose ≥ 300 mg/dL, and upon initiation, noninsulin agents — especially SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 RAs — should generally be continued for ongoing metabolic and organ-protective benefits unless contraindicated [^111sf3fo] [^114osk1i]. Hold on, I should verify the principle of continuing background therapy: ADA 2025 explicitly recommends continuation of glucose-lowering agents when starting insulin, which aligns with modern basal-plus approaches and cardiorenal protection goals [^114osk1i].

> Let me think about special populations, starting with older adults. In older or frail adults, I need to ensure we avoid hypoglycemia and overtreatment; guidelines advise individualizing A1C targets, often relaxing goals in complex or frail patients, and prioritizing agents with low hypoglycemia risk, with explicit deintensification when harms outweigh benefits [^1111fM3o] [^111yopic]. I should confirm that this is consistent across ADA and endocrine guidance: yes, both emphasize hypoglycemia risk as central and support deintensification in vulnerable elders [^1111fM3o] [^111yopic].

> Next, I should review youth-onset type 2 diabetes, and I need to be careful not to overgeneralize adult data. Management centers on family-based lifestyle intervention and metformin as first-line pharmacotherapy, with attention to obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and psychosocial factors; evidence remains more limited than in adults, so individualized, guideline-concordant care and retention strategies are critical [^11187i5Q] [^1162vcFz]. Wait, let me verify the emphasis on comorbidity screening and retention: ISPAD and pediatric reviews consistently highlight these as core elements given high dropout and complication risk in youth-onset T2D [^11187i5Q] [^1162vcFz].

> I should confirm glycemic targets and how they have evolved. While a general A1C target around 7% applies to many nonpregnant adults with reasonable life expectancy, guidelines now stress individualization based on comorbidities, hypoglycemia risk, duration, and patient preferences, often allowing higher targets in older or complex patients and supporting tighter targets when safely achievable in younger or lower-risk individuals [^112k5cHt]. Hold on, I should verify the principle: yes, ADA/EASD and primary care summaries consistently endorse individualized, risk-stratified A1C goals rather than a one-size-fits-all threshold [^113pBd7W] [^112k5cHt].

> Let me consider lifestyle and social determinants of health, because pharmacotherapy without these foundations underperforms. Comprehensive care includes medical nutrition therapy, physical activity, weight management, diabetes self-management education and support, and systematic attention to SDOH; guidelines also recommend a Mediterranean-style eating pattern to improve glycemia, weight, and blood pressure where appropriate [^114JZZer] [^113CxMYu] [^111BMTFs]. I should double-check that SDOH integration is emphasized in ADA 2025: yes, it is explicitly included in glucose-lowering management principles, reinforcing equity-focused care [^111BMTFs].

> Next, I should review implementation gaps, because knowing what to do is not enough. Real-world data show persistent underuse of SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 RAs relative to eligibility, with only about 9% of eligible U.S. adults receiving them historically, highlighting cost, access, and inertia as major barriers. Addressing these is essential to realize guideline-concordant outcomes [^111MqiS2] [^1122m9GD]. Wait, let me verify the magnitude: CDC analyses estimate that approximately 82% of U.S. adults with T2D would be eligible for GLP-1 RAs and/or SGLT-2 inhibitors under ADA/EASD risk-based recommendations, underscoring the scope of the gap [^1122m9GD].

> I will now synthesize a practical decision framework, but I need to ensure it remains faithful to the evidence. Start with metformin plus lifestyle at diagnosis if pharmacotherapy is indicated. Layer in an SGLT-2 inhibitor and/or GLP-1 RA early for those with ASCVD, HF, CKD, or high cardiovascular risk. Consider initial combination therapy when A1C is markedly elevated or goals are unlikely with monotherapy. Add insulin for symptomatic hyperglycemia or very high A1C while maintaining cardiometabolic agents. And individualize A1C targets and deintensify in older or frail adults to avoid harm, all within shared decision-making and SDOH-aware care plans [^113aJx7e] [^112VEpub] [^111sf3fo] [^1111fM3o]. Hold on, I should verify that this aligns with major guidelines: ADA 2025, ADA/EASD 2022, and ESC 2023 all support these pillars, with ACP 2024 also endorsing addition of SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1 RAs to metformin for their mortality and cardiorenal benefits [^113pBd7W] [^113aJx7e] [^113ayVRd] [^111ucKR7].

> But wait, what if metformin is not tolerated or contraindicated? I should confirm alternatives. In such cases, initiating an SGLT-2 inhibitor or GLP-1 RA as first-line monotherapy is reasonable, particularly when cardiorenal risk is present, with selection tailored to comorbidity profile, patient preferences, and access; this maintains the principle of risk-stratified, outcomes-focused care even without metformin as the base [^112VEpub]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied metformin must precede all therapy; guidelines allow flexibility when metformin is unsuitable, reinforcing individualized selection of SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1 RAs as appropriate substitutes [^112VEpub].

> Finally, I need to ensure ongoing reassessment is built into the plan. Therapy should be reviewed at least quarterly to adjust for changes in A1C, weight, blood pressure, kidney function, cardiovascular status, hypoglycemia, tolerability, and patient goals, with proactive deintensification when risks outweigh benefits. This cadence aligns with ADA's emphasis on continuous, individualized care and avoidance of therapeutic inertia [^111BMTFs]. Hold on, I should verify that this iterative approach is explicit: yes, ADA 2025 operationalizes ongoing management based on evolving patient factors and shared decision-making, which I will integrate into routine follow-up [^113pBd7W].

The latest T2D guidelines prioritize **metformin as first-line therapy** unless contraindicated, with early addition of SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists for patients with ASCVD, CKD, or HF, regardless of A1c [^1166XBdv] [^112VEpub]. A1c targets are individualized (typically 7–8% in older/complex patients; < 7% in younger/healthier patients), and **combination therapy is recommended** when A1c is ≥ 1.5% above target [^115D4r6u] [^116WNWFw]. Weight management, blood pressure, and lipid control are integral, and insulin is reserved for persistent hyperglycemia or as adjunctive therapy [^111sf3fo] [^114osk1i]. Shared decision-making and addressing social determinants of health are emphasized to improve adherence and outcomes [^111BMTFs].

---

## First-line pharmacologic therapy

- **Metformin**: Preferred initial therapy unless contraindicated (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m², severe hepatic impairment, or intolerance) [^114yCGpj].

- **Lifestyle interventions**: Concurrent with metformin; include nutrition, physical activity, and weight management [^114JZZer].

---

## Second-line pharmacologic therapy

Second-line therapy is **individualized** based on comorbidities and patient characteristics:

| **Comorbidity** | **Recommended therapy** |
|-|-|
| ASCVD or high risk | - GLP-1 RA (semaglutide, liraglutide, dulaglutide) or SGLT-2 inhibitor (empagliflozin, canagliflozin, dapagliflozin) [^114rkHe5] [^112VEpub] |
| Heart failure | - SGLT-2 inhibitor (dapagliflozin, empagliflozin) [^114rkHe5] |
| Chronic kidney disease | - SGLT-2 inhibitor (empagliflozin, dapagliflozin, canagliflozin) [^114rkHe5] [^112VEpub] |
| No significant comorbidities | - GLP-1 RA, SGLT-2 inhibitor, DPP-4 inhibitor, thiazolidinedione, or sulfonylurea [^notfound] |

---

## Glycemic targets

A1c targets are **individualized** based on patient characteristics:

- **General target**: A1c < 7% for most nonpregnant adults [^112k5cHt].

- **Older/complex patients**: A1c 7–8% if significant comorbidities or hypoglycemia risk [^notfound].

- **Younger/healthier patients**: A1c < 6.5% if safely achievable [^notfound].

---

## Combination therapy

Combination therapy is recommended when A1c is **≥ 1.5% above target** or when rapid glycemic control is needed [^116WNWFw]. Common combinations include metformin with a GLP-1 RA or SGLT-2 inhibitor, and dual therapy with a GLP-1 RA and SGLT-2 inhibitor for additive cardiorenal benefits [^112VEpub].

---

## Insulin therapy

Insulin is indicated for persistent hyperglycemia (A1c > 10% or fasting glucose > 300 mg/dL) or when noninsulin therapies fail [^111sf3fo]. Basal insulin is typically initiated first, with intensification (basal-bolus or pump) as needed [^114Sjo19].

---

## Non-glycemic management

Blood pressure and lipid control are essential; **target BP < 130/80 mmHg** and LDL < 70 mg/dL in high-risk patients. Weight management includes lifestyle, pharmacotherapy (e.g. semaglutide), and metabolic surgery when indicated [^1148f6ju].

---

## Special populations

- **Older adults**: Individualized targets; prioritize avoiding hypoglycemia and frailty considerations [^115D4r6u].

- **Chronic kidney disease**: Prefer SGLT-2 inhibitors; adjust dosing as eGFR declines [^112VEpub].

- **Pregnancy**: Insulin is first-line; avoid oral agents except metformin in select cases.

---

## Emerging therapies and future directions

Emerging therapies include **GIP/GLP-1 co-agonists** (e.g. tirzepatide) for superior glycemic and weight effects, and precision medicine approaches targeting obesity phenotypes and genetic markers [^notfound]. Digital health tools are increasingly used to enhance adherence and monitoring [^notfound].

---

## Implementation and adherence

Shared decision-making aligns therapy with patient preferences and improves adherence [^113pBd7W]. Addressing social determinants — including access, education, and support — is critical for optimal outcomes [^111BMTFs].

---

The latest T2D guidelines emphasize **individualized, comorbidity-driven care**, with metformin first-line and early use of GLP-1 RAs or SGLT-2 inhibitors for ASCVD/CKD/ HF; they also call for integrated weight, BP, and lipid management, and shared decision-making to optimize adherence and outcomes [^113pBd7W].

### Personalizing guidelines for diabetes management: twilight or dawn of the expert? [^111PKqb5]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

This opinion article on the management of type 2 diabetes considers the old and new format of guidelines and critical changes in the character of such guidelines. We highlight limitations of the guidelines and make recommendations for how treatment can be more personalised.

Discussion

Published guidelines for the management of adult-onset non-insulin requiring diabetes have adopted a formulaic approach to patient management that can be overseen centrally and delivered by personnel with limited training. Recently, guidelines have taken a patient-centered, multiple risk-factor approach. Importantly, local funding issues are considered, but drive the final action and not the decision-making process. The nature of the disease can be determined by laboratory tests, including screening for diabetes-associated autoantibodies. The strategy remains step-up, with intensification of drug or insulin dose. As with past guidelines, there is an assumption that in each patient with type 2 diabetes, metformin is used initially, but targets and therapies then veer in different directions to create a matrix of options based on the features and responses of each individual. Factors to consider include: (A)ge, (B)ody weight, (C)omplications and co-morbidities, Diabetes (D)uration and (E)xpense, but also patient preference and patient response.

Summary

Guidelines for the management of type 2 diabetes have important limitations and a patient-centered, multiple target, multiple therapy approach is proposed.

### SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists for adults with type 2 diabetes: a clinical practice guideline [^112VEpub]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

What are the benefits and harms of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists when added to usual care (lifestyle interventions and/or other diabetes drugs) in adults with type 2 diabetes at different risk for cardiovascular and kidney outcomes?

Current Practice

Clinical decisions about treatment of type 2 diabetes have been led by glycaemic control for decades. SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists are traditionally used in people with elevated glucose level after metformin treatment. This has changed through trials demonstrating atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) benefits independent of medications' glucose-lowering potential.

Recommendations

The guideline panel issued risk-stratified recommendations concerning the use of SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists in adults with type 2 diabetes• Three or fewer cardiovascular risk factors without established CVD or CKD: Weak recommendation against starting SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists.• More than three cardiovascular risk factors without established CVD or CKD: Weak recommendation for starting SGLT-2 inhibitors and weak against starting GLP-1 receptor agonists.• Established CVD or CKD: Weak recommendation for starting SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists.• Established CVD and CKD: Strong recommendation for starting SGLT-2 inhibitors and weak recommendation for starting GLP-1 receptor agonists.• For those committed to further reducing their risk for CVD and CKD outcomes: Weak recommendation for starting SGLT-2 inhibitors rather than GLP-1 receptor agonists.

How This Guideline Was Created

An international panel including patients, clinicians, and methodologists created these recommendations following standards for trustworthy guidelines and using the GRADE approach. The panel applied an individual patient perspective.

The Evidence

A linked systematic review and network meta-analysis (764 randomised trials included 421346 participants) of benefits and harms found that SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists generally reduce overall death, and incidence of myocardial infarctions, and end-stage kidney disease or kidney failure (moderate to high certainty evidence). These medications exert different effects on stroke, hospitalisations for heart failure, and key adverse events in different subgroups. Absolute effects of benefit varied widely based on patients' individual risk (for example, from five fewer deaths in the lowest risk to 48 fewer deaths in the highest risk, for 1000 patients treated over five years). A prognosis review identified 14 eligible risk prediction models, one of which (RECODe) informed most baseline risk estimates in evidence summaries to underpin the risk-stratified recommendations. Concerning patients' values and preferences, the recommendations were supported by evidence from a systematic review of published literature, a patient focus group study, a practical issues summary, and a guideline panel survey.

Understanding The Recommendation

We stratified the recommendations by the levels of risk for CVD and CKD and systematically considered the balance of benefits, harms, other considerations, and practical issues for each risk group. The strong recommendation for SGLT-2 inhibitors in patients with CVD and CKD reflects what the panel considered to be a clear benefit. For all other adults with type 2 diabetes, the weak recommendations reflect what the panel considered to be a finer balance between benefits, harms, and burdens of treatment options. Clinicians using the guideline can identify their patient's individual risk for cardiovascular and kidney outcomes using credible risk calculators such as RECODe. Interactive evidence summaries and decision aids may support well informed treatment choices, including shared decision making.

Identifiable clinical groups of patients

Both A1C target and antihyperglycemic drugs used to achieve the target might need specific considerations for identifiable clinical groups of patients, i.e. patients with comorbidities or patients with short life expectancy. In this counterpoint article, however, we focus on patients with long-term good prognosis.

Regarding medical management for diabetes mellitus type 2, more specifically with respect to initial therapy, treatment intensification, ACP 2024 guidelines recommend to add a SGLT-2 inhibitor (to reduce the risk of all-cause mortality, major adverse cardiovascular events, progression of CKD, and hospitalization due to congestive HF) or GLP-1 agonist (to reduce the risk of all-cause mortality, major adverse cardiovascular events, and stroke) to metformin and lifestyle modifications in adult patients with T2DM with inadequate glycemic control.

### Management of type 2 diabetes in developing countries: balancing optimal glycaemic control and outcomes with affordability and accessibility to treatment [^11347LVo]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Consistent with the ADA/EASD consensus statement, a patient-centred approach is the key. Factors such as efficacy in achieving glycaemic control, reduction of microvascular and macrovascular outcomes, safety, patient adherence and barriers, such as cost and access to therapies, must be considered when deciding on a treatment for type 2 diabetes. Considering all of these factors, and particularly where cost is an issue, the ADA/EASD consensus statement recommends metformin followed by a second-line sulfonylurea.

This review will, therefore, consider the evidence for efficacy, outcomes, availability and accessibility of these treatment options in the management of type 2 diabetes in restricted-resource settings.

### Are diabetes management guidelines applicable in' real life'? [^112oeNwm]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The American Diabetes Association (ADA) has published several diabetes treatment algorithms, but none have been tested in real-life settings. The aim of this study is to analyze the feasibility of achieving and/or maintaining HbA1c levels < 7.0% using current diabetes treatment guidelines and the resources available in the public health care system of Brazil.

Methods

A one-year, single-arm interventional study was conducted with type 2 diabetes patients in a primary care unit. Intervention consisted of intensification of lifestyle changes and sequential prescription of drugs based on ADA guidelines using the medications available through the publicly funded Unified Health System (Sistema Único de Saúde, SUS).

Results

Ninety patients (age: 62.7 ± 10.4 years; diabetes duration: 8.2 ± 9.1 years) completed the trial. During the intervention period, increases were observed in number of oral antidiabetic agent (OAD) classes per patient (1.50 ± 0.74 vs. 1.67 ± 0.7; p = 0.015), OAD pills per patient (2.64 ± 1.89 vs. 3.33 ± 2.23 pills/patient; p < 0.001), insulin dosage (0.20 ± 0.29 vs.0.50 ± 0.36 UI/kg/day; p = 0.008) and number of patients on insulin (19 [21%] vs. 31 [34%]; p < 0.01), but no improvement in HbA1c (7.2 ± 1.6% vs. 7.3 ± 1.5%; p = 0.453) or frequency of patients on target, defined as HbA1c < 7% (53.3% vs. 48.9%; p = 0.655). Patients with baseline HbA1c < 7% had a small increase in HbA1c during the trial (6.3 ± 0.4 vs. 6.7 ± 0.9%; p = 0.002). No such change was observed in those with baseline HbA1c ≥ 7%.

Conclusions

In this group of patients with a mean baseline HbA1c of 7.2%, implementation of 2006/2009 ADA/EASD guidelines led to achievement of the therapeutic goal of HbA1c < 7% in a small proportion of patients.

### Management of type 2 diabetes mellitus in older patients: current and emerging treatment options [^114XbcSc]. Diabetes Therapy (2013). Low credibility.

Elderly patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are a rapidly emerging population that presents unique clinical challenges. This diverse patient group can differ widely in terms of physical and mental status, which can increase their risk of complications including hypoglycemia, falls, and depression. These factors can negatively impact their glycemic control, safety, and quality of life. The risk of hypoglycemic events is elevated among elderly patients with diabetes. In many cases, these events are related to antidiabetic therapy and the pursuit of strict glycemic control. Fear of a hypoglycemic episode, on the part of the patient and/or healthcare provider, is another major barrier to achieving glycemic control. Hypoglycemic events, even in the absence of awareness of the event (asymptomatic), can have negative consequences. To help manage these risks, several national and international organizations have proposed guidelines to address individualized treatment goals for older adults with diabetes. This article reviews current treatment guidelines for setting glycemic targets in elderly patients with T2DM, and discusses the role of emerging treatment options in this patient population.

### Clinical guidance for diabetes… [^113HvNGo]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Health care providers play a crucial role in helping patients prevent or delay type 2 diabetes and manage all types of diabetes.
- They are often the first line in screening and referring patients to a type 2 diabetes prevention program or diabetes self-management education and support services. Preventing type 2 diabetes About 1 in 3 American adults has prediabetes, which increases their risk for developing type 2 diabetes. More than 8 in 10 of them don't know they have prediabetes. As a health care provider, you're often the first line in screening and referring patients to a type 2 diabetes prevention program. Refer your patients with prediabetes to the CDC-led National Diabetes Prevention Program lifestyle change program. Research shows that the program can cut the risk of type 2 diabetes by more than half.

This yearlong program, delivered by a trained Lifestyle Coach, will teach your patients how to eat healthy, increase physical activity, manage stress, and stay motivated. They can also lower their risk of a heart attack or stroke and improve their overall health. Already delivering the lifestyle change program. Managing diabetes Stay up to date on the latest Diabetes Standards of Care to ensure your patients are receiving timely, equitable, and high-quality care. These guidelines include screenings and management for diabetes and related complications, such as cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease. Your patients manage their diabetes care with regular guidance and support from their health care team. At every health care visit, you and other care team members can encourage them to take the steps needed to manage their diabetes effectively:

- Promoting Ear Health for People With Diabetes
- Promoting Eye Health for People With Diabetes
- Promoting Foot Health for People With Diabetes
- Promoting Medication Management for People With Diabetes
- Promoting Oral Health for People With Diabetes As a health care provider, you know firsthand that these actions are key to preventing complications and enhancing quality of life for people with diabetes. Living successfully with diabetes means developing the skills to self-manage outside the clinical setting. Diabetes self-management education and support helps people learn practical skills and personalized strategies to manage diabetes in their everyday life. DSMES provides structured support so people with diabetes can make sustainable lifestyle changes with the help of a diabetes care and education specialist. People who participate in DSMES are more likely to have better health outcomes, including lower A1C levels and fewer complications.

### Medical management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes: a consensus algorithm for the initiation and adjustment of therapy: a consensus statement of the American diabetes association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes [^114dK8ee]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Tier 1: well-validated core therapies

These interventions represent the best established and most effective and cost-effective therapeutic strategy for achieving the target glycemic goals. The tier one algorithm is the preferred route of therapy for most patients with type 2 diabetes.

Step 1: lifestyle intervention and metformin.

Based on the numerous demonstrated short- and long-term benefits that accrue when weight loss and increased levels of activity are achieved and maintained, as well as the cost-effectiveness of lifestyle interventions when they succeed, the consensus is that lifestyle interventions should be initiated as the first step in treating new-onset type 2 diabetes (Fig. 2). These interventions should be implemented by health care professionals with appropriate training — usually registered dietitians experienced in behavioral modification — and be sensitive to ethnic and cultural differences among populations. Moreover, lifestyle interventions to improve glucose, blood pressure, and lipid levels, and to promote weight loss or at least avoid weight gain, should remain an underlying theme throughout the management of type 2 diabetes, even after medications are used. For the 10–20% of patients with type 2 diabetes who are not obese or overweight, modification of dietary composition and activity levels may play a supporting role, but medications are still generally required early in the course of diabetes (seebelow).

The authors recognize that for most individuals with type 2 diabetes, lifestyle interventions fail to achieve or maintain the metabolic goals either because of failure to lose weight, weight regain, progressive disease, or a combination of factors. Therefore, our consensus is that metformin therapy should be initiated concurrently with lifestyle intervention at diagnosis. Metformin is recommended as the initial pharmacological therapy, in the absence of specific contraindications, for its effect on glycemia, absence of weight gain or hypoglycemia, generally low level of side effects, high level of acceptance, and relatively low cost. Metformin treatment should be titrated to its maximally effective dose over 1–2 months, as tolerated (see text box, entitled Titration of Metformin). Rapid addition of other glucose-lowering medications should be considered in the setting of persistent symptomatic hyperglycemia.

3 ARE SPECIFIC GUIDELINES FOR EARLY‐ONSET TYPE 2 DIABETES NEEDED?

Despite such an adverse risk profile for early‐onset type 2 diabetes, current guidelines for the management of type 2 diabetes in adults, make no age‐related treatment recommendations. There are guidelines for the management of type 2 diabetes in paediatric populations but these are broadly consensus‐based and currently limited in drug choice by licensing of available medications. With the exception of a few small studies that have specifically investigated treatment response in paediatric populations, there is a paucity of data providing sufficient granularity regarding the most effective medications at this age or indeed, if existing treatments show differences in efficacy based on age‐at‐onset, although this may change as further studies of glucose‐lowering therapies in children report outcomes. For adults, deriving signals from existing drug trials is also problematic as, in most large randomised controlled cardiovascular outcome trials, the median age of recruitment is in the 5th or 6th decade. The aspiration to provide age‐specific medication guidelines is, therefore, not currently achievable.

Data from the National Diabetes Audit for England and Wales (NDA) does, however, highlight areas for improvement. Each year, eight care processes on every individual coded with diabetes in GP records are submitted for audit; HbA 1c, blood pressure, cholesterol, creatinine, urine albumin to creatinine ratio, BMI, smoking and a foot check (the ninth important care process, retinal screening, was only recently included, due to prior problems of data flow in England). Greater achievement of care processes has further been associated with a reduction in mortality in people with type 2 diabetes. An analysis of the 2019–2020 dataset demonstrates that 33% of people with type 2 diabetes currently aged < 40 years receiving all 8 care processes, in contrast to 47% of those aged 40–59 years and 59% of those aged 60–79 years. In the absence of evidence supporting broader medication choices for younger people, more targeted approaches, that address lifestyle choices, psychological well‐being and engagement with healthcare providers are likely to be beneficial given the over‐representation of those from socioeconomically deprived and from minority ethnic groups, to support greater completion of these care processes.

Grading of scientific evidence.

There has been considerable evolution in the evaluation of scientific evidence and in the development of evidence-based guidelines since the ADA first began publishing practice guidelines. Accordingly, we developed a classification system to grade the quality of scientific evidence supporting ADA recommendations for all new and revised ADA position statements.

Recommendations are assigned ratings of A, B, or C, depending on the quality of evidence (Table 1). Expert opinion (E) is a separate category for recommendations in which there is as yet no evidence from clinical trials, in which clinical trials may be impractical, or in which there is conflicting evidence. Recommendations with an "A" rating are based on large well-designed clinical trials or well-done meta-analyses. Generally, these recommendations have the best chance of improving outcomes when applied to the population to which they are appropriate. Recommendations with lower levels of evidence may be equally important but are not as well supported. The level of evidence supporting a given recommendation is noted either as a heading for a group of recommendations or in parentheses after a given recommendation.

Table 1
ADA evidence-grading system for clinical practice recommendations

Of course, evidence is only one component of clinical decision-making. Clinicians care for patients, not populations; guidelines must always be interpreted with the needs of the individual patient in mind. Individual circumstances, such as comorbid and coexisting diseases, age, education, disability, and, above all, patients' values and preferences, must also be considered and may lead to different treatment targets and strategies. Also, conventional evidence hierarchies, such as the one adapted by the ADA, may miss some nuances that are important in diabetes care. For example, while there is excellent evidence from clinical trials supporting the importance of achieving glycemic control, the optimal way to achieve this result is less clear. It is difficult to assess each component of such a complex intervention.

ADA will continue to improve and update the Clinical Practice Recommendations to ensure that clinicians, health plans, and policymakers can continue to rely on them as the most authoritative and current guidelines for diabetes care. Our Clinical Practice Recommendations are also available on the Association's website at.

### Current antihyperglycemic treatment guidelines and algorithms for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^113tKjX8]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity are associated with increased cardiovascular risk. While lifestyle interventions such as medical nutrition therapy and appropriately prescribed physical activity remain cornerstones of disease prevention and treatment, most patients with type 2 diabetes will eventually require pharmacotherapy for glycemic control. Fortunately, many of these patients are able to achieve desired glycemic targets with the use of currently available antihyperglycemic agents. Both not-for-profit disease-specific organizations and healthcare specialty societies have provided guidance about the appropriate selection of these therapies. Type 2 diabetes treatment guidelines and algorithms have been developed, taking into account a combination of evidence-based information and expert opinions, with various groups offering diverse glucose goals and approaches to hyperglycemia management. Virtually all recognize that type 2 diabetes is a multifaceted disease, necessitating an integrated yet individualized approach to patient care.

### Advances and counterpoints in type 2 diabetes. what is ready for translation into real-world practice, ahead of the guidelines [^116eaHkz]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

This review seeks to address major gaps and delays between our rapidly evolving body of knowledge on type 2 diabetes and its translation into real-world practice. Through updated and improved best practices informed by recent evidence and described herein, we stand to better attain A1c targets, help preserve beta cell integrity and moderate glycemic variability, minimize treatment-emergent hypoglycemia, circumvent prescribing to "treatment failure", and prevent long-term complications. The first topic addressed in this review concerns updates in the 2023 and 2024 diabetes treatment guidelines for which further elaboration can help facilitate integration into routine care. The second concerns advances in diabetes research that have not yet found their way into guidelines, though they are endorsed by strong evidence and are ready for real-world use in appropriate patients. The final theme addresses lingering misconceptions about the underpinnings of type 2 diabetes-fundamental fallacies that continue to be asserted in the textbooks and continuing medical education upon which physicians build their approaches. A corrected and up-to-date understanding of the disease state is essential for practitioners to both conceptually and translationally manage initial onset through late-stage type 2 diabetes.

### Pharmacological treatment for type 2 diabetes integrating findings from cardiovascular outcome trials: an expert consensus in the UK [^114ALJGY]. Diabetic Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

In people with Type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Thus, as well as controlling glucose, reducing the risk of cardiovascular events is a key goal. The results of cardiovascular outcome trials have led to updates for many national and international guidelines. England, Wales and Northern Ireland remain exceptions, with the most recent update to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines published in 2015. We reviewed current national and international guidelines and recommendations on the management of people with Type 2 diabetes. This article shares our consensus on clinical recommendations for the use of sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT-2is) and glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) in people with Type 2 diabetes and established or at very high risk of cardiovascular disease in the UK. We also consider cost-effectiveness for these therapies. We recommend considering each person's cardiovascular risk and using diabetes therapies with proven cardiovascular benefits when appropriate to improve long-term outcomes and cost-effectiveness.

### Medical management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes: a consensus algorithm for the initiation and adjustment of therapy: a consensus statement of the American diabetes association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes [^113jySzk]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Process

The guidelines and algorithm that follow are derived from two sources. One source is the clinical trials that address the effectiveness and safety of the different modalities of therapy. Here, the writing group reviewed a wide variety of studies related to the use of drugs as monotherapy or in combination to lower glycemia. Unfortunately, the paucity of high-quality evidence in the form of well-controlled clinical trials that directly compare different diabetes treatment regimens remains a major impediment to recommending one class of drugs, or a particular combination of therapies, over another.

The second source of material that informed our recommendations was clinical judgement, that is, our collective knowledge and clinical experience, which takes into account benefits, risks, and costs in the treatment of diabetes. As in all clinical decision making, an evidence-based review of the literature must also be supplemented by value judgements, where the benefits of treatment are weighed against risks and costs in a subjective fashion. While we realize that others may have different judgements, we believe that the recommendations made in this new iteration of our treatment algorithm will guide therapy and result in improved glycemic control and health status over time.

### Treatment of type 2 diabetes in youth [^1162vcFz]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

TREATMENT OF YOUTH WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES

The treatment of type 2 diabetes necessitates a multifaceted approach to alleviate both insulin resistance and β-cell failure, achieve glycemic control, and prevent ensuing complications. This approach should include family-based behavioral lifestyle intervention together with pharmacotherapy, with the objectives of weight loss or prevention of continued weight gain, adoption of healthier lifestyle habits, normalization of glycemia, and control of comorbidities such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, nephropathy, and hepatic steatosis.

Current management guidelines for youth with type 2 diabetes are not evidence-based because of the lack of clinical trials, and the majority of treatment recommendations are based on experience in adults. Irrespective of this, it appears that almost all adolescents achieve normalization of HbA 1c, at least initially, regardless of the severity of type 2 diabetes manifestation and the initial treatment modality, which may vary significantly among pediatric endocrinologists. Moreover, a large percentage of adolescents with type 2 diabetes, up to 60%, are lost to follow-up at diabetes care centers. Therefore, efforts should be geared to individualize therapy in type 2 diabetes not only based on phenotype and genotype, but also based on ethnic/cultural beliefs and traditions.

### Initial combination therapy for type 2 diabetes mellitus: is it ready for prime time? [^113inb9Q]. The American Journal of Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

The increased prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus is primarily being driven by the increasing global rates of overweight/obesity. Given the magnitude of this epidemic, we can expect these metabolic abnormalities to play an increasing role in the development of cardiovascular disease. In a pathophysiologic sense, type 2 diabetes is a multiorgan, multifactorial condition, characterized by β-cell dysfunction, insulin resistance in peripheral tissues and the liver, defective incretin activity, and elevated levels of free fatty acids and proinflammatory mediators. Despite the considerable burden of disease associated with type 2 diabetes, most patients are not at, or are unable to achieve, recommended glycemic control guideline targets. In part, this is because of the relentlessly progressive nature of the disease, but it may also be attributable to the current diabetes treatment paradigm, which is characterized by ineffective lifestyle interventions, followed by monotherapy and frequent early treatment failure with prolonged periods of elevated glucose as a consequence of clinical inertia. Thus, it is most appropriate to rethink the current treatment paradigm for type 2 diabetes in the context of a more aggressive initial therapy; specifically with early initiation of combination therapy. Our current understanding of the complex pathophysiology of the disease and the progressive deterioration in glycemic control over time supports the philosophy of earlier intervention with a more comprehensive initial therapy. Thus, while control of hyperglycemia remains the paramount goal, focusing on the underlying pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes is increasingly becoming the therapeutic strategy, with the aim of potentially providing disease modification. Although this is a logical approach, it remains to be demonstrated that early combination therapy will result in disease modification in a clinical setting. Not surprisingly, the incretin-based therapies have gained a great deal of attention in the context of being a component of initial combination therapy, given their potential beneficial effects on β-cell function with lowered risk of weight gain and hypoglycemia.

### ADA / EASD updated guidelines: glycemic control is only… [^112k5cHt]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question What are the current recommendations from the American Diabetes Association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Bottom Line The management of type 2 diabetes continues to move away from glycemic goals and toward a more holistic approach to patient care that considers medications, weight management, attention to cardiovascular risk factors, and kidney protection. Metformin is recommended for most patients, although the new classes of medications that affect the heart and kidneys should be considered for many patients. Sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones, and insulin, all of which have little effect except to lower blood glucose levels, are distinctly de-emphasized. Synopsis The guidelines were developed by a working group composed of members from two professional societies and included endocrinologists and researchers. Most of the working group members had substantial relationships with the pharmaceutical industry. The group systematically reviewed the evidence and assessed its quality. Rather than strict goals, the guidelines continue to move away from an emphasis on markers of glucose control and toward an emphasis on modifiable risk factors to prevent complications and optimize quality of life. However, they recommend an A1C goal of less than 7% in most adults with a life expectancy of 10 years or more. The authors suggest principles of care that are more holistic, including emphasis on social determinants, psychosocial factors, and shared decision-making. The four categories of care include weight management, medications for glycemia management, attention to cardiovascular risk factors, and kidney protection.

Metformin remains a mainstay of treatment, although the authors suggest treatment that controls glycemia and offers cardiorenal protection, such as a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor and a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, alone or in combination. Insulin should be used when needed to provide further control of blood sugar.

### Current type 2 diabetes guidelines: individualized treatment and how to make the most of metformin [^115Eo33y]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Evidence-based guidelines provide the premise for the delivery of quality care to preserve health and prevent disabilities and premature death. The systematic gathering of observational, mechanistic and experimental data contributes to the hierarchy of evidence used to guide clinical practice. In the field of diabetes, metformin was discovered more than 100years ago, and with 60years of clinical use, it has stood the test of time regarding its value in the prevention and management of type 2 diabetes. Although some guidelines have challenged the role of metformin as the first-line glucose-lowering drug, it is important to point out that the cardiovascular-renal protective effects of sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists were gathered from patients with type 2 diabetes, the majority of whom were treated with metformin. Most national, regional and international guidelines recommend metformin as a foundation therapy with emphasis on avoidance of therapeutic inertia and early attainment of multiple treatment goals. Moreover, real-world evidence has confirmed the glucose-lowering and cardiovascular-renal benefits of metformin accompanied by an extremely low risk of lactic acidosis. In patients with type 2 diabetes and advanced chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate 15–30mL/min/1.73 m²), metformin discontinuation was associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular-renal events compared with metformin persistence. Meanwhile, it is understood that microbiota, nutrients and metformin can interact through the gut-brain-kidney axis to modulate homeostasis of bioactive molecules, systemic inflammation and energy metabolism. While these biological changes contribute to the multisystem effects of metformin, they may also explain the gastrointestinal side effects and vitamin B12 deficiency associated with metformin intolerance. By understanding the interactions between metformin, foods and microbiota, healthcare professionals are in a better position to optimize the use of metformin and mitigate potential side effects. The United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study and the Da Qing Diabetes Prevention Program commenced 40years ago provided the first evidence that type 2 diabetes is preventable and treatable. To drive real-world impact from this evidence, payors, practitioners and planners need to co-design and implement an integrated, data-driven, metformin-based programme to detect people with undiagnosed diabetes and prediabetes (intermediate hyperglycaemia), notably impaired glucose tolerance, for early intervention. The systematic data collection will create real-world evidence to bring out the best of metformin and make healthcare sustainable, affordable and accessible.

### Pharmacologic approaches to glycemic treatment of type 2 diabetes: synopsis of the 2020 American diabetes association's standards of medical care in diabetes clinical guideline [^113UpWzV]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Description

The American Diabetes Association (ADA) updates the Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes annually to provide clinicians, patients, researchers, payers, and other interested parties with evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis and management of diabetes.

Methods

To develop the 2020 Standards, the ADA Professional Practice Committee, comprising physicians, adult and pediatric endocrinologists, diabetes educators, registered dietitians, epidemiologists, pharmacists, and public health experts, continuously searched MEDLINE (English language only) from 15 October 2018 through August-September 2019 for pertinent studies, including high-quality trials that addressed pharmacologic management of type 2 diabetes. The committee selected and reviewed the studies, developed the recommendations, and solicited feedback from the larger clinical community.

Recommendations

This synopsis focuses on guidance relating to the pharmacologic treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes. Recommendations address oral and noninsulin injectable therapies, insulin treatment, and combination injectable therapies. Results of recent large trials with cardiovascular and renal outcomes are emphasized.

### Metformin – the gold standard in type 2 diabetes: what does the evidence tell us? [^117H2PAq]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2009). Low credibility.

Metformin is a cornerstone of oral antidiabetic treatment. Recent joint American and European guidelines recommend instituting metformin therapy along with lifestyle modification at the time type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is diagnosed. Metformin acts to reduce hepatic gluconeogenesis and improve glucose uptake, and it may exert protective effects on pancreatic islet cells. Although metformin therapy produces substantial reductions in HbA1c, it does not produce body weight gain, is not associated with substantial risk for hypoglycaemia and has neutral to positive effects on lipids and blood pressure. The major adverse events associated with metformin are gastrointestinal. T2DM progresses even with initially effective monotherapy, and most patients will therefore receive combination therapy. When selecting agents to coadminister with metformin, a physician must consider efficacy in glycaemic control, safety, tolerability and any effects that may compromise overall efficacy (e.g. effects on body weight, lipids or blood pressure). In this regard, incretin-based therapies have characteristics that make them particularly suitable for add-on therapy with metformin.

### Novel therapies with precision mechanisms for type 2 diabetes mellitus [^111LtmBg]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2021). High credibility.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is one of the greatest health crises of our time and its prevalence is projected to increase by > 50% globally by 2045. Currently, 10 classes of drugs are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of T2DM. Drugs in development for T2DM must show meaningful reductions in glycaemic parameters as well as cardiovascular safety. Results from an increasing number of cardiovascular outcome trials using modern T2DM therapeutics have shown a reduced risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, congestive heart failure and chronic kidney disease. Hence, guidelines have become increasingly evidence based and more patient centred, focusing on reaching individualized glycaemic goals while optimizing safety, non-glycaemic benefits and the prevention of complications. The bar has been raised for novel therapies under development for T2DM as they are now expected to achieve these aims and possibly even treat concurrent comorbidities. Indeed, the pharmaceutical pipeline for T2DM is fertile. Drugs that augment insulin sensitivity, stimulate insulin secretion or the incretin axis, or suppress hepatic glucose production are active in more than 7,000 global trials using new mechanisms of action. Our collective goal of being able to truly personalize medicine for T2DM has never been closer at hand.

The updated guideline, Oral Pharmacologic Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, was developed by the American College of Physicians and was endorsed by the American Academy of Family Physicians. These recommendations are provided only as assistance for physicians making clinical decisions regarding the care of their patients. As such, they cannot substitute for the individual judgment brought to each clinical situation by the patient's family physician. As with all clinical reference resources, they reflect the best understanding of the science of medicine at the time of publication, but they should be used with the clear understanding that continued research may result in new knowledge and recommendations. These recommendations are only one element in the complex process of improving the health of America. To be effective, the recommendations must be implemented.

### Management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes: evidence and uncertainty [^114hzRPs]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2013). Low credibility.

The panoply of treatment algorithms, periodically released to improve guidance, is one mean to face therapeutic uncertainty in pharmacological management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes, especially after metformin failure. Failure of recent guidelines to give advice on the use of specific antidiabetic drugs in patients with co-morbidity may generate further uncertainty, given the frequent association of type 2 diabetes with common comorbidity, including, although not limited to obesity, cardiovascular disease, impaired renal function, and frailty. The Italian Association of Diabetologists (Associazione Medici Diabetologi, AMD) recognized the need to develop personalized treatment plans for people with type 2 diabetes, taking into account the patients' individual profile (phenotype), with the objective of the safest possible glycemic control. As not every subject with type 2 diabetes benefits from intensive glycemic control, flexible regimens of treatment with diabetes drugs (including insulin) are needed for reaching individualized glycemic goals. Whether personalized diabetology will improve the quality healthcare practice of diabetes management is unknown, but specific research has been launched.

### Should metformin remain the first-line therapy for treatment of type 2 diabetes? [^1166XBdv]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

American Diabetes Association (ADA) standards of care guidelines

In 2008, the first ADA and European Association of the Study of Diabetes (EASD) consensus guidelines on management of hyperglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes stated that metformin, along with lifestyle interventions, should be used as first-line therapy. While the guidelines of pharmacologic treatment for type 2 diabetes in the United States have largely remained the same, recent updates in 2019 and 2020 have added additional components in light of compelling data from cardiovascular and renal outcomes trials. According to the ADA 2020 Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes, metformin remains the preferred first-line pharmacologic treatment for type 2 diabetes unless contraindicated or not tolerated by the patient. Other glucose-lowering agents may be added to metformin considering patient preferences, hypoglycemic risk, and comorbidities.

While the ADA still recommends metformin as first-line therapy, the updated Standards of Care have become more outcomes-focused rather than solely concentrating on glycemic control. For this reason, in patients with certain comorbidities such as high-risk for or established ASCVD, heart failure or chronic kidney disease, it is recommended to consider GLP-1 RAs and SGLT-2 inhibitors independently of baseline HbA1c or individualized HbA1c target. In 2019, the European Society of Cardiology, in collaboration with the EASD, went one step further in altering their treatment guidelines. SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 RAs are now recommended as first-line therapy for patients with established ASCVD or high cardiovascular risk in Europe. Metformin should be considered as the first line in patients without CVD and at moderate cardiovascular risk.

### Optimal management of type 2 diabetes: the evidence [^111oZQ9e]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

This paper reviews the evidence in relation to the optimal target for HbA1c and outlines a global treatment algorithm for people with type 2 diabetes. While most guidelines recommend a general HbA1c target of 7%, recent large scale intervention studies have examined the potential benefits of lower targets. These studies have generally shown that lower HbA1c targets provide no macrovascular benefits and limited effects on microvascular complications while increasing rates of hypoglycaemia. Overall these studies do not support a general HbA1c target lower than 7.0%. However an individual's HbA1c target should be set and reviewed taking into account treatment benefits, safety, and tolerability. This may mean that an HbA1c target lower than 7% is appropriate for some when it can be easily and safely achieved but equally a higher HbA1c target may be appropriate in others. Clinicians and consumers are fortunate in having a wide range of pharmacological agents available to treat hyperglycaemia, however access to many of these options is limited in many middle and low income countries. Developing treatment algorithms is complex for several reasons. The major limitation is the limited evidence base for choosing particular treatment options or combinations of medications. However it is possible to derive a generic evidence-informed consensus algorithm which considers availability, access and cost of medications which can be adapted for local country use.

The consensus algorithm for the medical management of type 2 diabetes was published in August 2006 with the expectation that it would be updated, based on the availability of new interventions and new evidence to establish their clinical role. The authors continue to endorse the principles used to develop the algorithm and its major features. We are sensitive to the risks of changing the algorithm cavalierly or too frequently, without compelling new information. An update to the consensus algorithm published in January 2008 specifically addressed safety issues surrounding the thiazolidinediones. In this revision, we focus on the new classes of medications that now have more clinical data and experience.

### Management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes: a patient-centered approach: position statement of the American diabetes association (ADA) and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) [^116qZT8W]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Glycemic management in type 2 diabetes mellitus has become increasingly complex and, to some extent, controversial, with a widening array of pharmacological agents now available, mounting concerns about their potential adverse effects and new uncertainties regarding the benefits of intensive glycemic control on macrovascular complications. Many clinicians are therefore perplexed as to the optimal strategies for their patients. As a consequence, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) convened a joint task force to examine the evidence and develop recommendations for antihyperglycemic therapy in nonpregnant adults with type 2 diabetes. Several guideline documents have been developed by members of these two organizations and by other societies and federations (,–). However, an update was deemed necessary because of contemporary information on the benefits/risks of glycemic control, recent evidence concerning efficacy and safety of several new drug classes, the withdrawal/restriction of others, and increasing calls for a move toward more patient-centered care.

This statement has been written incorporating the best available evidence and, where solid support does not exist, using the experience and insight of the writing group, incorporating an extensive review by additional experts (acknowledged below). The document refers to glycemic control; yet this clearly needs to be pursued within a multifactorial risk reduction framework. This stems from the fact that patients with type 2 diabetes are at increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality; the aggressive management of cardiovascular risk factors (blood pressure and lipid therapy, antiplatelet treatment, and smoking cessation) is likely to have even greater benefits.

These recommendations should be considered within the context of the needs, preferences, and tolerances of each patient; individualization of treatment is the cornerstone of success. Our recommendations are less prescriptive than and not as algorithmic as prior guidelines. This follows from the general lack of comparative-effectiveness research in this area. Our intent is therefore to encourage an appreciation of the variable and progressive nature of type 2 diabetes, the specific role of each drug, the patient and disease factors that drive clinical decision making, and the constraints imposed by age and comorbidity. The implementation of these guidelines will require thoughtful clinicians to integrate current evidence with other constraints and imperatives in the context of patient-specific factors.

### An early assessment of the real-world treatment patterns of type 2 diabetes: a comparison to the 2018 ADA / EASD consensus report recommendations [^111MqiS2]. Diabetes Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, prevalence of guideline-aligned treatment use in 2019 was low, particularly since many patients fit into multiple risk groups with established treatment benefits. This research in the real world reveals that SGLT-2is and GLP-1RAs are underutilized and are only partially aligned with current treatment recommendations. Lower RTUR and larger alignment gaps were seen in the Medicare population. Utilization of recommended therapies are lagging in some clinical and demographic groups, and they represent potential opportunities to make meaningful improvement in the care for patients with type 2 diabetes. Continued monitoring and evaluations of real-world use data will help inform and improve implementation of guideline-based treatment in actual prescribing practice and perhaps identify where further consensus is needed to enhance effectiveness in diabetes care.

A recent Diabetes Surgery Summit of 50 international experts examined gastrointestinal surgery for the management of Type 2 diabetes. Delegates strongly endorsed that conventional gastrointestinal surgery — Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), laparoscopic adjustable gastric band (LAGB) or bilio-pancreatic diversion (BPD) — should be considered for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes in acceptable surgical candidates with BMI > 35 kg/m² who are inadequately controlled by lifestyle and medical therapy. Further trial evidence was deemed necessary for inadequately controlled Type 2 diabetes in candidates suitable for surgery with mild-to-moderate obesity (BMI 30–35 kg/m²).

### Guideline recommendations and the positioning of newer drugs in type 2 diabetes care [^113ayVRd]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2021). High credibility.

Cardiovascular outcome trials in patients with type 2 diabetes at high cardiovascular risk have led to remarkable advances in our understanding of the effectiveness of GLP-1 receptor agonists and SGLT2 inhibitors to reduce cardiorenal events. In 2019, the American Diabetes Association (ADA), European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD), and European Society of Cardiology (ESC) published updated recommendations for the management of such patients. We are concerned that ongoing discussions focusing on the differences between the endocrinologists' consensus report from the ADA and EASD and cardiologists' guidelines from the ESC are contributing to clinical inertia, thereby effectively denying evidence-based treatments advocated by both groups to patients with type 2 diabetes and cardiorenal disease. A subset of members from the writing groups of the ADA-EASD consensus report and the ESC guidelines was convened to emphasise where commonalities exist and to propose an integrated framework that encompasses the views incorporated in management approaches proposed by the ESC and the ADA and EASD. Coordinated action is required to ensure that people with type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, heart failure, or chronic kidney disease are treated appropriately with an SGLT2 inhibitor or GLP-1 receptor agonist. In our opinion, this course should be initiated independent of background therapy, current glycaemic control, or individualised treatment goals.

### Individualizing insulin therapy in the management of type 2 diabetes [^115Cko8u]. The American Journal of Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

It is recognized that reducing hyperglycemia early on in disease progression has long-term benefits for patients with diabetes. Insulin therapy has greater potential to reduce hyperglycemia than other therapies; however, there is often a significant delay in insulin initiation and intensification. Insulin replacement therapy in type 2 diabetes should no longer be viewed as the treatment of last resort. With the development of modern insulin analogs, the field has evolved. Large clinical trials have improved our understanding of the potential benefits and risks associated with intensive glycemic control in different patient populations and highlighted the need for individualization of glycemic targets and treatment strategies. Current treatment guidelines recognize the important role of insulin therapy both early on and throughout the progression of type 2 diabetes.

Abstract

In people with Type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Thus, as well as controlling glucose, reducing the risk of cardiovascular events is a key goal. The results of cardiovascular outcome trials have led to updates for many national and international guidelines. England, Wales and Northern Ireland remain exceptions, with the most recent update to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines published in 2015. We reviewed current national and international guidelines and recommendations on the management of people with Type 2 diabetes. This article shares our consensus on clinical recommendations for the use of sodium‐glucose co‐transporter 2 inhibitors (‐2is) and glucagon‐like peptide 1 receptor agonists (‐1s) in people with Type 2 diabetes and established or at very high risk of cardiovascular disease in the. We also consider cost‐effectiveness for these therapies. We recommend considering each person's cardiovascular risk and using diabetes therapies with proven cardiovascular benefits when appropriate to improve long‐term outcomes and cost‐effectiveness.

### Use of new diabetes medicines… [^1122m9GD]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Recent guidelines from the American Diabetes Association and European Association for the Study of Diabetes recommend newer types of diabetes medications.
- CDC researchers found that most Americans living with type 2 diabetes are eligible under these new guidelines. What did this study examine. In 2022, the ADA and EASD jointly released new medication recommendations for adults with type 2 diabetes. They recommended newer types of diabetes medications as first-line treatment for adults with type 2 diabetes who also have:

- A heart disease called atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.
- Heart failure.
- Kidney disease.
- High risk for ASCVD. This study examined how many US adults with type 2 diabetes would meet the recommended criteria to use these medications. Terms to know Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, or GLP-1s, are a type of medicine for people with diabetes.

They lower blood sugar levels, can help with weight loss, and protect the heart and kidneys. Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors, or SGLT-2s are a type of medicine for people with diabetes. Similar to GLP-1s, they lower blood sugar levels, can help with weight loss, and protect the heart and kidneys. Because GLP-1s and SGLT-2s work in different ways, they can be taken together. Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, also known as ASCVD, is a type of heart disease where blood vessels are narrowed or damaged. People at high risk of ASCVD were defined as being over age 55 and having 2 or more risk factors:

- Obesity
- Hypertension
- High cholesterol
- Kidney disease
- Current smoking. Study results CDC researchers studied 1, 330 nonpregnant adults with type 2 diabetes between 2017 and 2020. Researchers estimate that with new ADA and EASD guidelines, 82% of US adults with type 2 diabetes may be eligible to take a GLP-1, or SGLT-2, or both.

They also estimate that almost all Medicare beneficiaries with type 2 diabetes may be eligible to take these medicines. Very few US adults were taking GLP-1s or SGLT-2s during the study timeframe. This is because they were not yet approved for first-line treatment. Only 9% were already taking either a GLP-1 or an SGLT-2 medication. What's important about this study. This study showed that over 8 in 10 US adults with type 2 diabetes are eligible for new, effective diabetes medicines. These medicines are not just beneficial for blood sugar management. They also help reduce risk for diabetes complications by protecting the heart and kidneys, and help people lose weight if needed. Currently, these medicines are expensive, and cost may be a barrier for many people with type 2 diabetes. More research on cost-effectiveness can help guide diabetes interventions at a sustainable cost.

### Costs and treatment pathways for type 2 diabetes in the UK: a mastermind cohort study [^11488LFV]. Diabetes Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Stratified treatment approaches for type 2 diabetes appear promising, since there is evidence of underlying heterogeneity in type 2 diabetes and many classes of oral anti-diabetes drugs with different mechanisms of action are available. Ongoing research efforts, such as the Mastermind study, aim to develop and evaluate stratified treatments. However, evaluating the benefits of stratified treatment over current clinical practice is made difficult by the increasingly complex sequencing and combinations of diabetes therapies under current clinical practice. While guidelines suggest that metformin monotherapy should be used as the initial medication therapy, there is no clear guidance on the choice of other drug classes for later therapy lines or in persons where metformin is not tolerated or contraindicated. Algorithms and case studies have been developed to support individualised treatment decisions. However, the current state of clinical practice is not clear, with surprisingly little reliable information. Previous health economic studies mainly focused on the costs of diabetes or national prescription trends. The few studies that have investigated the costs, timing and duration of individual therapies have mostly focused on first-line therapy.

This article reports contemporary treatment pathways (i.e. the timing, duration and drug types prescribed in first- and second-line therapy) and associated costs for medication therapy of type 2 diabetes in the UK. We describe how treatment pathways and costs vary over time and across demographic subgroups.

Description

The American Diabetes Association (ADA) annually updates the Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes to provide clinicians, patients, researchers, payers, and other interested parties with evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis and management of patients with diabetes.

Methods

For the 2017 Standards, the ADA Professional Practice Committee updated previous MEDLINE searches performed from 1 January 2016 to November 2016 to add, clarify, or revise recommendations based on new evidence. The committee rates the recommendations as A, B, or C, depending on the quality of evidence, or E for expert consensus or clinical experience. The Standards were reviewed and approved by the Executive Committee of the ADA Board of Directors, which includes health care professionals, scientists, and laypersons. Feedback from the larger clinical community informed revisions.

Recommendations

This synopsis focuses on recommendations from the 2017 Standards about pharmacologic approaches to glycemic treatment of type 2 diabetes.

Objective

The objective is to formulate clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of diabetes in older adults.

Conclusions

Diabetes, particularly type 2, is becoming more prevalent in the general population, especially in individuals over the age of 65 years. The underlying pathophysiology of the disease in these patients is exacerbated by the direct effects of aging on metabolic regulation. Similarly, aging effects interact with diabetes to accelerate the progression of many common diabetes complications. Each section in this guideline covers all aspects of the etiology and available evidence, primarily from controlled trials, on therapeutic options and outcomes in this population. The goal is to give guidance to practicing health care providers that will benefit patients with diabetes (both type 1 and type 2), paying particular attention to avoiding unnecessary and/or harmful adverse effects.

### Advances and counterpoints in type 2 diabetes. what is ready for translation into real-world practice, ahead of the guidelines [^111amviP]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Key takeaways

Recent new guideline recommendations ready to be routinely incorporated into routine practice include the following: ◦ Complication-centric prescribing should take center stage. Treatment plans should no longer 'silo' hyperglycemia as a single treatment target but rather manage it synchronously with the patient's comorbidities and risk factors. ◦ In patients with cardiorenal risk factors, long-acting glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2is) have been shown to provide protection and are recommended as preferred treatments. ◦ A novel algorithm enables treatment decision-making for latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) based on glutamic acid decarboxylase (GADA) and C-peptide testing
Several key advances in the management of type 2 diabetes are supported by strong evidence that make these ready for use in routine care, despite remaining in a 'holding pattern' before full integration into guidelines. These include: ◦ The pleiotropic benefits of several antidiabetic agents provide important new considerations to treatment decision-making; and, should be employed in treatment selection in the clinic. ◦ Disease remission should be elevated to a primary objective of case management of type 2 diabetes beyond the role it had in past routine care. The inherent resilience of beta cells can be harnessed to help remit hyperglycemia through the use of diet and lifestyle modifications and/or short-term intensive pharmacotherapy.
The underpinnings of type 2 diabetes etiology and progression have been corrected. In particular, ◦ Early type 2 diabetes is no longer considered an intractable ('inexorable') state. Beta cells, in fact, remain robust and resilient through much of the course of the disease, and with support, can resume partial or complete glucoregulation. ◦ Type 2 diabetes is not a single disease across all patients, nor does it arise from the same defects. Accordingly, tailored therapy is imperative. ◦ Precision medicine veers away from management to treatment failure with sequential add-on therapy. Instead, targeted therapy can address the individual drivers of hyperglycemia in each patient without agents that are ineffective in the given patient. ◦ Target attainment is distinctly possible with current treatments, without treatment-emergent hypoglycemia. Intensive glucose control is pivotal for preventing or offsetting diabetes-related long-term outcomes. ◦ With the expanding antidiabetes armamentarium, it is possible to reduce reliance on sulfonylureas and exogenous insulin, which present less desirable benefit: risk profiles (including weight gain, hypoglycemia, and 'wear and tear' on beta cells) than many other currently available options.

A systematic evaluation of the literature since 2014 informed new recommendations. These include additional focus on lifestyle management and diabetes self-management education and support. For those with obesity, efforts targeting weight loss, including lifestyle, medication, and surgical interventions, are recommended. With regards to medication management, for patients with clinical cardiovascular disease, a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor or a glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist with proven cardiovascular benefit is recommended. For patients with chronic kidney disease or clinical heart failure and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, an SGLT2 inhibitor with proven benefit is recommended. GLP-1 receptor agonists are generally recommended as the first injectable medication.

Grading of scientific evidence.

There has been considerable evolution in the evaluation of scientific evidence and in the development of evidence-based guidelines since the ADA first began publishing practice guidelines. Accordingly, we developed a classification system to grade the quality of scientific evidence supporting ADA recommendations for all new and revised ADA position statements.

Recommendations are assigned ratings of A, B, or C, depending on the quality of evidence (Table 1). Expert opinion (E) is a separate category for recommendations in which there is as yet no evidence from clinical trials, in which clinical trials may be impractical, or in which there is conflicting evidence. Recommendations with an "A" rating are based on large well-designed clinical trials or well-done meta-analyses. Generally, these recommendations have the best chance of improving outcomes when applied to the population to which they are appropriate. Recommendations with lower levels of evidence may be equally important but are not as well supported. The level of evidence supporting a given recommendation is noted either as a heading for a group of recommendations or in parentheses after a given recommendation.

Of course, evidence is only one component of clinical decision-making. Clinicians care for patients, not populations; guidelines must always be interpreted with the needs of the individual patient in mind. Individual circumstances, such as comorbid and coexisting diseases, age, education, disability, and, above all, patients' values and preferences, must also be considered and may lead to different treatment targets and strategies. Also, conventional evidence hierarchies, such as the one adapted by the ADA, may miss some nuances that are important in diabetes care. For example, while there is excellent evidence from clinical trials supporting the importance of achieving glycemic control, the optimal way to achieve this result is less clear. It is difficult to assess each component of such a complex intervention.

ADA will continue to improve and update the Clinical Practice Recommendations to ensure that clinicians, health plans, and policymakers can continue to rely on them as the most authoritative and current guidelines for diabetes care. Our Clinical Practice Recommendations are also available on the Association's website at.

Choosing specific diabetes interventions and their roles in treating type 2 diabetes

Numerous reviews have focused on the characteristics of the specific diabetes interventions listed below. In addition, meta-analyses and reviews have summarized and compared the glucose-lowering effectiveness and other characteristics of the medications. The aim here is to provide enough information to justify the choices of medications, the order in which they are recommended, and the use of combinations of therapies. Unfortunately, there is a dearth of high-quality studies that provide head-to-head comparisons of the ability of the medications to achieve the currently recommended glycemic levels. The authors highly recommend that such studies be conducted. However, even in the absence of rigorous, comprehensive studies that directly compare the efficacy of all available glucose-lowering treatments and their combinations, we feel that there are enough data regarding the characteristics of the individual interventions to provide the guidelines below.

An important intervention that is likely to improve the probability that a patient will have better long-term control of diabetes is to make the diagnosis early, when the metabolic abnormalities of diabetes are usually less severe. Lower levels of glycemia at the time of initial therapy are associated with lower A1C levels over time and decreased long-term complications.

We used the Appraisal of Guidelines, Research and Evaluation in Europe (AGREE) appraisal instrument to evaluate the guidelines from various organizations. On the basis of the review of the available guidelines, we recommend: STATEMENT 1: To prevent microvascular complications of diabetes, the goal for glycemic control should be as low as is feasible without undue risk for adverse events or an unacceptable burden on patients. Treatment goals should be based on a discussion of the benefits and harms of specific levels of glycemic control with the patient. A hemoglobin A1c level less than 7% based on individualized assessment is a reasonable goal for many but not all patients. STATEMENT 2: The goal for hemoglobin A1c level should be based on individualized assessment of risk for complications from diabetes, comorbidity, life expectancy, and patient preferences. STATEMENT 3: We recommend further research to assess the optimal level of glycemic control, particularly in the presence of comorbid conditions.

Type 2 diabetes — antihyperglycemic pharmacotherapy principles and initial therapy: The goal of antihyperglycemic treatment is to achieve clinical and laboratory targets with minimal adverse effects and reduce diabetes-related complications, and minimizing the risks of hypoglycemia and weight gain and maximizing cardiovascular and renal benefits should be priorities. As monotherapy, most noninsulin agents reduce A1C by 0.5% to 2.0%. Metformin is often the preferred initial therapy for most persons with new-onset type 2 diabetes and, once initiated, should be continued as long as it is tolerated and not contraindicated; it can be used in combination with virtually all other antihyperglycemic agents, including insulin, when monotherapy does not reach the glycemic target.

### The early treatment of type 2 diabetes [^111toY7V]. The American Journal of Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

The growing epidemic of type 2 diabetes is one of the leading causes of premature morbidity and mortality worldwide, mainly due to the micro- and macrovascular complications associated with the disease. A growing body of evidence suggests that although the risk of developing complications is greater with glucose levels beyond the established threshold for diagnosis — increasing in parallel with rising hyperglycemia-individuals with glucose levels in the prediabetic range are already at increased risk. Early intervention, ideally as soon as abnormalities in glucose homeostasis are detected, is of great importance to minimize the burden of the disease. However, as the early stages of the disease are asymptomatic, diagnosing prediabetes and early overt type 2 diabetes is challenging. The aim of this article is to discuss these challenges, the benefits of early intervention — with emphasis on the prevention trials showing that progression to type 2 diabetes can be delayed by addressing prediabetes — and the existing evidence-based guidelines that have been drawn to optimize the standards of care at the prediabetes and overt type 2 diabetes stages.

### Positioning sulphonylureas in a modern treatment algorithm for patients with type 2 diabetes: expert opinion from a European consensus panel [^111cgeXR]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

The large number of pharmacological agents available to treat type 2 diabetes (T2D) makes choosing the optimal drug for any given patient a complex task. Because newer agents offer several advantages, whether and when sulphonylureas (SUs) should still be used to treat T2D is controversial. Published treatment guidelines and recommendations should govern the general approach to diabetes management. However, expert opinions can aid in better understanding local practices and in formulating individual choices. The current consensus paper aims to provide additional guidance on the use of SUs in T2D. We summarize current local treatment guidelines in European countries, showing that SUs are still widely proposed as second-line treatment after metformin and are often ranked at the same level as newer glucose-lowering medications. Strong evidence now shows that sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2is) and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) are associated with low hypoglycaemia risk, promote weight loss, and exert a positive impact on vascular, cardiac and renal endpoints. Thus, using SUs in place of SGLT-2is and GLP-1RAs may deprive patients of key advantages and potentially important cardiorenal benefits. In subjects with ascertained cardiovascular disease or at very high cardiovascular risk, SGLT-2is and/or GLP-1RAs should be used as part of diabetes management, in the absence of contraindications. Routine utilization of SUs as second-line agents continues to be acceptable in resource-constrained settings.

Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline — objective and scope — states that "The objective is to formulate clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of diabetes in older adults". The conclusions note that "Diabetes, particularly type 2, is becoming more prevalent in the general population, especially in individuals over the age of 65 years", that "The underlying pathophysiology of the disease in these patients is exacerbated by the direct effects of aging on metabolic function", and that "Similarly, aging effects interact with diabetes to accelerate the progression of many common diabetes complications". The guideline explains that "Each section in this guideline covers all aspects of the etiology and available evidence, primarily from controlled trials, on therapeutic options and outcomes in this population", and that "The goal is to give guidance to practicing health care providers that will benefit patients with diabetes (both type 1 and type 2), paying particular attention to avoiding unnecessary and/or harmful adverse effects".

### The place of sulfonylureas in guidelines: why are there differences? [^113U7DHS]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The four main internationally recognised guidelines or consensus reports for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are from the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD)/American Diabetes Association (ADA), Diabetes Canada, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Diabetes Federation (IDF). Of these, EASD/ADA is the most popular despite it being only a consensus report, and not meeting the Institute of Medicine requirements for trustworthy guidelines. The current article describes the place of sulfonylureas (SUs) within current international guidelines for the management of T2DM, and critically examines the quality of the guideline development process and of the evidence to support those recommendations. This article is based on previously conducted studies and does not contain any studies with human participants or animals performed by the authors.

1 INTRODUCTION

Current standards of medical care for type 2 diabetes (T2D) promote individualized treatment according to co‐morbidities, individual preferences and treatment goals. 1, 2, 3 The American Diabetes Association (ADA) Standards of Care guidelines offer examples of important considerations for selecting a T2D therapy for any particular individual, including: the estimated reduction in HbA1c; adverse‐event profile; risk of hypoglycaemia; impact on body weight; ease and frequency of administration; cost and availability; adherence to and persistence with therapy; and prevalent complications and co‐morbidities. 1 The updated (2020) consensus report by the ADA and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes further emphasizes co‐morbidities such as atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), heart failure (HF) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) as key priorities for individualized care. 3 All these resources promote shared decision‐making between patient and physician. 1, 2, 3 Clinical practice guidelines clarify how treatment selection can be directed by high‐risk co‐morbidities, such as established ASCVD, CKD or HF, 1, 2, 3 but are less clear on how patient characteristics, treatment goals and preferences should direct treatment selection, and how this may vary among individuals. Another challenge is the lack of data to help predict potential outcomes in a specific individual. Current guidelines offer summaries of the efficacy, risk of hypoglycaemia, effect on body weight, and cardiovascular (CV) and renal events of the major classes of glucose‐lowering treatment, but these are based on pooled outcomes from intention‐to‐treat analyses, so do not represent expected outcomes for a specific individual. 4 An expert perspective on precision medicine in T2D emphasized that for most people without high‐risk co‐morbidities, there is often no clear choice to suggest the 'best' antihyperglycaemic medication. 4

Clinical tools for individualized care have been developed and implemented for other diseases. For example, the Framingham Cardiovascular Risk Score allows for the input of a range of patient‐specific characteristics, and provides a risk score for developing heart disease over the next 10 years, with associated indications for different preventative strategies. 5 Drawing inspiration from tools such as this, we have developed a prototype tool to estimate patient‐specific outcomes via a user‐friendly web interface.

ACP grading framework for evidence and recommendations using GRADE defines evidence certainty and recommendation strength categories as follows: High certainty is described as "Confident that the true effect lies close to the estimate of the effect (the intervention "results in" the effect)". Moderate certainty is "Moderately confident in the effect estimate: The true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a sizeable possibility that it is substantially different (the intervention "probably results in" the effect)". Low certainty is "Confidence in the effect estimate is limited: The true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect (the intervention "may result in" the effect)". Recommendation strength includes Strong (ACP recommends) when there is "Confidence that the benefits clearly outweigh risks and burden or vice versa", it "Applies to most patients in most circumstances", and "Only strong recommendations could be considered as quality indicators to guide the development of accountability, reporting, and payment programs"; and Conditional (ACP suggests) when "Benefits probably outweigh the risks and burden, or vice versa, but there is appreciable uncertainty", it "Applies to many patients but may differ depending on circumstances or patients' values and preferences", and "Policymaking will require substantial debates and involvement of many stakeholders. Policies are also more likely to vary between regions. Quality indicators would have to focus on the fact that adequate deliberation about the management options has taken place".

### Guideline approach to therapy in patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes [^111wdWcV]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Case for guidelines

Evidence-based recommendations should be at the core of the guidelines. Not all practice guidelines on antihyperglycemic drugs, however, are consistent with available evidence. Patient enrollment in clinical studies is also based mainly on baseline A1C, and treatment of a comparator is sometimes chosen unrelated to its pathophysiologic effect on hyperglycemia.

Our past experience with antihyperglycemic drugs is that recommendations to stepwise increase these drugs whenever A1C is above target might fail to prevent disease progression, necessitating intensive insulin therapy over time. This might be due to delayed reaction by the physician to a patient's change in A1C. One possible reason for this delay is that the other antihyperglycemic drugs (other than metformin), i.e. sulfonylureas and peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor (PPAR)-γ, have side effects that discourage physicians from recommending them as soon as A1C is above target. Introduction of insulin therapy in patients not at target, in particular, is also delayed substantially. At this stage, aiming to target with intensive insulin therapy might increase the risk for morbidity and mortality while the already long hyperglycemic exposure still puts the patient at great risk for late micro- and macrovascular complications (,–). The newer available drugs (incretins as well as sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors), owing to their efficacy and relatively mild side effects, could change physicians' inertia in such a way that they will prescribe these drugs at a much earlier stage — as soon as A1C is above target. This earlier intervention could prevent treat to failure and be as effective as early combination therapy.

### Treatment of type 2 diabetes: from "Guidelines" to "Position statements" and back: recommendations of the Israel national diabetes council [^116ssA2N]. Diabetes Care (2016). Low credibility.

Given the increased prevalence of type 2 diabetes worldwide, most patients are treated by their primary health care team (PHCT). PHCTs need guidance in choosing the best treatment regimen for patients, since the number of glucose-lowering agents (GLAs) is rapidly increasing, as is the amount of clinical data regarding these drugs. The American Diabetes Association/European Association for the Study of Diabetes Position Statement emphasizes the importance of personalized treatment and lists drug efficacy, risk of hypoglycemia, effect on weight, side effects, and cost as important parameters to consider when choosing GLAs. The suggested Israeli guidelines refocus earlier international recommendations from 2012 and 2015, based on emerging data from cardiovascular outcome trials as well as what we believe are important issues for patient care (i.e., durability, hypoglycemia risk, and weight gain).

### Systematic review of guideline recommendations for older and frail adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^115D4r6u]. Age and Ageing (2024). Medium credibility.

Key Points

Diabetes clinical practice guidelines are increasingly integrating recommendations specific for older adults.
Most diabetes clinical practice guidelines recommend a strict HbA1c target for healthier older adults and a more relaxed target older adults who are frail, medically complex or functionally impaired.
Most clinical practice guidelines place hypoglycaemic risk as central consideration in medication selection in all older adults.
Relatively few clinical practice guidelines provide pharmacotherapeutic recommendations for management of diabetes in individuals who are frail.

### Advances and counterpoints in type 2 diabetes. what is ready for translation into real-world practice, ahead of the guidelines [^11411GsN]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Despite the recent expansion of antidiabetic agents such as GLP-1 receptor agonists and SGLT-2is, glycemic control remains suboptimal in many patients. Approximately half of all type 2 diabetic patients in the United States and worldwide fail to achieve the glycemic target of A1c ≥ 7.0%.

Ninety percent of diabetes cases are managed by primary care providers. Guidelines are integral to updating best practices and are especially edifying for general practitioners who maintain a broad knowledge base across numerous medical conditions. Primary care providers are encouraged to apply the most effective treatment parameters in clinical practice rather than relying on specialists. This review seeks to highlight key developments in the field to both provision and empower generalists as well as specialists in dispensing care in line with the latest knowledge in the disease state ready for use in routine care.

The field of type 2 diabetes research has detailed guidelines issued by the American Diabetes Association and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinology. Many advances, however, see extensive delays in anatomizing research discoveries into clinical approaches. This prudence helps prevent the need to elaborate extensively on areas pending additional research or to deadopt a faulty recommendation. On the other hand, it impedes the timeliness of advances reaching patients. It also sets a deceptively slow rate of change in best practices, contributing to "physician habituation", one contributing aspect to clinical inertia.

In this review, we shortlisted timely leaps in the management of type 2 diabetes — advances that we believe are ready for "prime time". We provide context for selected updates that have already been incorporated into guidelines — context that we feel will edify the rationale for readers and speed adoption into real-world use. Second, we detail several important developments that are yet to be translated to the clinic while these remain either in vigorous debate or in limbo despite a strong body of evidence of the benefit and utility of these having benefit to patients.

Third, this review revisits outmoded dogmas about the basic science of type 2 diabetes — premises that continue to be widely reiterated in physician education but are, in fact, incorrect. Today's type 2 diabetes is "not your mother's type 2 diabetes", that is, our modern understanding of dysglycemia is a departure from old tenets. A correct understanding of beta cell function and dysglycemia is needed for physicians to be in command and optimally control diabetes and its sequelae in their clinics.
