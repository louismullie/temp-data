## Question

Low potassium diet

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about when and how to implement a low-potassium diet, especially in chronic kidney disease, and how to reconcile this with evolving evidence and guidelines. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical contexts where potassium restriction is indicated. Then, I should verify the strength and quality of evidence supporting restriction. Next, I will examine guideline positions and how they have shifted. After that, I need to check practical implementation details, including what to restrict and what to liberalize. Finally, I will consider special populations, monitoring, and how to integrate pharmacologic strategies like potassium binders, before summarizing a cautious, individualized approach.

> Let me first confirm the clinical contexts where a low-potassium diet is typically considered. The principal indication is hyperkalemia in CKD, particularly stages G3–G5, where impaired renal potassium excretion increases risk of life-threatening arrhythmias, and guidelines advise individualized dietary strategies after addressing non-dietary drivers of hyperkalemia such as medications, acidosis, and constipation [^116EoAM1] [^117XjtAM] [^111asU4A]. I should also remember that acute hyperkalemia management may include short-term dietary restriction of very high-potassium foods as a bridge while definitive therapy is instituted, but this is not a blanket chronic strategy [^111asU4A].

> Wait, let me verify the evidence base before jumping to conclusions. The most direct synthesis shows that potassium restriction lowers serum potassium by about 0.22 mmol/L compared with unrestricted intake in CKD, but the evidence quality is very low and largely observational, with conflicting signals on hard outcomes like mortality and CKD progression, so I need to be cautious about overgeneralizing benefit [^117HDskV] [^113iPd3o]. Hold on, I should also note that some meta-analytic data suggested lower potassium intake was associated with lower mortality, but that signal was inconsistent and likely confounded, reinforcing the need for randomized trials before endorsing routine restriction [^117HDskV] [^113iPd3o].

> Next, I should review how guidelines have evolved. Historically, many programs taught broad potassium restriction in CKD, but contemporary KDIGO guidance emphasizes individualized, dietitian-led counseling and cautions against routine restriction of plant foods, especially in early CKD where higher potassium intake from whole foods may be protective against progression and mortality [^117XjtAM] [^116Se56T] [^112j8XhC]. I need to ensure I align with this shift: restrict only when there is persistent hyperkalemia or high risk, and prioritize plant-forward patterns otherwise, given their cardiometabolic and kidney benefits [^117XjtAM] [^112j8XhC].

> I will now examine what to restrict and what to liberalize, because not all potassium sources behave the same. Let me think about bioavailability and processing: potassium additives in processed foods are highly bioavailable and can deliver large, rapid potassium loads, whereas whole plant foods contain fiber and organic potassium that may be less bioavailable and are accompanied by alkali and micronutrients that can mitigate hyperkalemia risk in some patients [^117HsT2J] [^113aJNEW]. Hold on, I should verify that current teaching materials still overemphasize restricting fruits and vegetables; indeed, many handouts disproportionately restrict plant foods while under-addressing processed foods and additives, which is outdated and may cause harm by reducing fiber and increasing constipation risk, thereby worsening potassium handling [^117FUpoe] [^111cJLeC].

> Let me consider practical implementation details. I should confirm that dietitian-led assessment is recommended to identify the dominant dietary potassium sources and tailor advice, including using cooking methods like boiling to reduce potassium in vegetables and substituting herbs and spices to maintain palatability [^117XjtAM] [^111cJLeC]. I need to ensure we also address constipation, because impaired colonic potassium excretion can raise serum potassium; liberalizing fiber within individualized limits can paradoxically improve potassium control in some patients [^111cJLeC] [^116EoAM1].

> But wait, what if the patient is on a potassium binder — does that change dietary advice? The advent of patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate offers pharmacologic control of baseline potassium, yet their site of action in the colon does not reliably blunt postprandial spikes from dietary potassium, so I should not assume binder therapy alone permits unrestricted intake; instead, a cautious, monitored liberalization with ongoing dietitian support is prudent while we await stronger trials [^117Bq6M8] [^114eKMQW]. Hold on, I should verify that guidelines still call for individualized, dietitian-guided strategies even with binders; yes, KDIGO continues to emphasize education and individualized plans rather than blanket liberalization [^117XjtAM].

> Next, I should review special populations and risk modifiers. In advanced CKD and dialysis, residual renal function, stooling patterns, and interdialytic weight gain all influence potassium handling, so serum potassium is an imperfect marker of dietary adherence; I need to combine biochemical monitoring with structured dietary recalls and adjust advice dynamically rather than impose static restrictions [^112jNkvr] [^113hZr8j]. For children with CKD, I should confirm that overly strict potassium restriction can impair growth; guidance supports careful balancing of potassium and phosphorus with age-appropriate targets and family education to avoid excessive restriction [^112m3Zvb].

> I should double-check the role of the sodium-to-potassium ratio, because this often gets overlooked. Observational and interventional data suggest the urinary sodium-to-potassium ratio tracks more closely with blood pressure than either mineral alone, and achieving a lower ratio via sodium reduction and potassium increase yields meaningful BP lowering in the general population, though feasibility at a population level is challenging and must be contextualized in CKD where hyperkalemia risk exists [^115bYdW9] [^116NvQip]. Let me reconsider whether this changes CKD advice; it does not override individualized potassium management in CKD, but it reinforces that when potassium can be safely increased, the cardiovascular payoff is substantial [^117XjtAM].

> Let me synthesize a cautious, stepwise approach. First, confirm true hyperkalemia with repeat testing and address non-dietary causes such as ACEi/ARB, MRAs, NSAIDs, acidosis, hyperglycemia, and constipation. Second, if potassium remains elevated, implement short-term restriction of foods with highly bioavailable potassium such as processed items, juices, purees, and salt substitutes, while preserving as much fiber and plant diversity as feasible. Third, involve a renal dietitian to individualize targets, teach portion control, and adjust cooking methods. Fourth, reassess serum potassium within 2–4 weeks and liberalize as soon as safely possible to restore plant-forward intake. Fifth, consider potassium binders in recurrent hyperkalemia to enable dietary liberalization, with ongoing monitoring and education [^116EoAM1] [^117XjtAM] [^111cJLeC] [^117Bq6M8].

> In conclusion, I need to ensure the message is precise: a low-potassium diet is not a default for CKD and should be reserved for patients with persistent hyperkalemia after reversible causes are corrected, using a time-limited, dietitian-guided, plant-sparing approach that prioritizes whole foods and addresses additives, with continuous reassessment to safely liberalize intake whenever possible [^117XjtAM] [^116Se56T] [^112j8XhC].

A low-potassium diet is **primarily indicated for patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stages 3–5** [^117XjtAM], those on dialysis, or anyone with persistent hyperkalemia (serum potassium > 5.5 mmol/L) [^116EoAM1] who cannot maintain normal potassium with medication adjustments alone. It is **not routinely recommended for the general population**, as most people benefit from higher potassium intake to lower blood pressure and cardiovascular risk [^114fPdA6] [^116a9xLB]. Restrict potassium only when clinically indicated, and tailor advice to the patient's kidney function, medications, and lab results [^116juaqa] [^115djd7W].

---

## Indications for a low-potassium diet

A low-potassium diet is **indicated in the following clinical scenarios**:

- **Chronic kidney disease (CKD)**: Particularly stages 3–5, where impaired renal excretion increases hyperkalemia risk [^117XjtAM] [^116Se56T].

- **Dialysis patients**: Both hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients often require potassium restriction to prevent hyperkalemia [^113hZr8j].

- **Persistent hyperkalemia**: Serum potassium > 5.5 mmol/L that cannot be controlled with medication adjustments alone [^116EoAM1].

- **Certain medications**: Patients on ACE inhibitors, ARBs, potassium-sparing diuretics, or potassium supplements may require dietary potassium restriction if hyperkalemia develops [^notfound].

## Foods to limit or avoid

Foods high in potassium that should be **limited or avoided** include:

| **Food category** | **Examples** |
|-|-|
| Fruits | Bananas, oranges, avocados, melons, dried fruits, kiwis, mangoes |
| Vegetables | Potatoes, sweet potatoes, tomatoes, spinach, kale, broccoli, beans, lentils |
| Dairy products | Milk, yogurt, cheese |
| Nuts and seeds | Almonds, peanuts, sunflower seeds |
| Protein sources | Red meat, poultry, fish, soy products |
| Processed foods | Salt substitutes containing potassium chloride, processed meats, canned soups |

---

## Foods generally safe to include

Foods generally considered safe in moderation for patients on a low-potassium diet include:

- **Fruits**: Apples, berries, grapes, peaches, pineapples, plums (limit portions).

- **Vegetables**: Bell peppers, cucumbers, lettuce, onions, radishes, zucchini (boiling and discarding water reduces potassium).

- **Grains**: White rice, pasta, bread (limit whole grains due to higher potassium content).

- **Protein**: Eggs, small portions of lean meats, poultry, and fish.

---

## Risks and considerations

While a low-potassium diet is essential for certain patients, it carries potential risks and considerations:

- **Nutritional deficiencies**: Restricting fruits and vegetables may reduce intake of vitamins, minerals, and fiber, increasing risk of deficiencies and constipation [^111cJLeC].

- **Quality of life**: Dietary restrictions can negatively impact patient satisfaction and adherence [^notfound].

- **Individualized approach**: Dietary potassium restriction should be individualized based on kidney function, medications, and serum potassium levels, with regular monitoring and adjustment [^116juaqa] [^115djd7W].

---

## Current clinical guidelines

Recent clinical guidelines emphasize an **individualized approach** to dietary potassium management:

- **KDIGO 2024**: Recommends individualized dietary potassium management based on kidney function, medications, and serum potassium levels, with dietitian guidance [^117XjtAM] [^116XzSeW].

- **VA/DoD 2025**: Advises against routine potassium restriction in early CKD, as high potassium intake from whole foods may be protective; restrict only if hyperkalemia persists despite medication optimization [^114NorNf].

- **UK Renal Association**: Recommends dietitian-led dietary potassium modification for patients with persistent hyperkalemia [^116EoAM1].

---

## Conclusion

A low-potassium diet is **indicated for patients with advanced CKD, dialysis patients, or those with persistent hyperkalemia** who cannot maintain normal potassium levels with medication adjustments alone. It is not recommended for the general population, as higher potassium intake is beneficial for cardiovascular health. Dietary potassium restriction should be individualized, regularly monitored, and adjusted based on clinical context and patient preferences [^117XjtAM] [^116Se56T].

### Are low intakes of calcium and potassium important causes of cardiovascular disease? [^111gvyeh]. American Journal of Hypertension (2001). Low credibility.

Inadequate levels of calcium and potassium intake have long been associated with higher blood pressures. Epidemiologic data have suggested these associations and many clinical trials have indicated causal relationships. However, the intervention data are plagued with inconsistent study designs, populations, and results, and there remain many questions regarding dietary recommendations of these nutrients for cardiovascular health. Until recently, nutrition research focused on single-nutrient interventions, generally with disparate results. Recognizing that nutrients are not consumed individually but as combined constituents of a varied diet, efforts in this area have shifted to the role of the overall diet, or dietary patterns, in blood pressure and cardiovascular disease. The suggestions of epidemiologic surveys nearly two decades ago that the total diet has a greater influence on cardiovascular health than do specific components, are now being borne out by randomized controlled trials demonstrating this effect. From these dietary pattern studies, it has become increasingly clear that it is not merely excesses of single nutrients but also deficiencies of multiple nutrients in combination, such as calcium and potassium, that have the greatest dietary effects on cardiovascular health. Several risk factors for cardiovascular disease have now been shown to be reduced with diets that meet the current recommended dietary guidelines, ie, that provide appropriate levels of vitamins, minerals, fiber, and macronutrients. In addition, new data indicate that regular consumption of these diets is associated with decreased mortality. Adequate intake of minerals such as calcium and potassium-specifically derived from foods, where they coexist with other essential nutrients-contributes to cardiovascular as well as overall health.

### Potassium intake: the cinderella electrolyte [^113dEA5T]. European Heart Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Dietary guidelines recommend intake targets for some essential minerals, based on observational and experimental evidence relating mineral intake levels to health outcomes. For prevention of cardiovascular disease, reducing sodium intake and increasing potassium intake are the principal tools. While reducing sodium intake has received greatest public health priority, emerging evidence suggests that increasing potassium intake may be a more important target for cardiovascular prevention. Increased potassium intake reduces blood pressure and mitigates the hypertensive effects of excess sodium intake, and the recent large Phase III SSaSS trial reported that increasing potassium intake (and reducing sodium intake) in populations with low potassium intake and high sodium intake, through salt substitution (25% KCl, 75%NaCl), reduces the risk of stroke in patients at increased cardiovascular risk. As key sources of potassium intake include fruit, vegetables, nuts, and legumes, higher potassium intake may be associated with healthy dietary patterns. The current review makes the case that increasing potassium intake might represent a more advantageous dietary strategy for prevention of cardiovascular disease. Future research should focus on addressing the independent effect of potassium supplementation in populations with low or moderate potassium intake, and determine effective strategies to increase potassium intake from diet.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for hyperkalemia, more specifically with respect to low-potassium diet, UKKA 2023 guidelines recommend to offer expert assessment by a registered or specialist renal dietitian and advice on dietary strategies to modify potassium intake in patients with CKD and persistent hyperkalemia with serum potassium > 5.5 mmol/L.

### Can novel potassium binders liberate people with chronic kidney disease from the low-potassium diet? A cautionary tale [^117Bq6M8]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

The advent of new potassium binders provides an important breakthrough in the chronic management of hyperkalemia for people with CKD. In addition to the direct benefits of managing hyperkalemia, many researchers and clinicians view these new medications as a possible means to safely transition patients away from the low-potassium diet to a more healthful eating pattern. In this review, we examine the mechanisms of potassium binders in the context of hyperkalemia risk related to dietary potassium intake in people with CKD. We note that whereas these medications target hyperkalemia caused by potassium bioaccumulation, the primary evidence for restricting dietary potassium is risk of postprandial hyperkalemia. The majority of ingested potassium is absorbed alongside endogenously secreted potassium in the small intestines, but the action of these novel medications is predominantly constrained to the large intestine. As a result and despite their effectiveness in lowering basal potassium levels, it remains unclear whether potassium binders would provide protection against hyperkalemia caused by excessive dietary potassium intake in people with CKD. Until this knowledge gap is bridged, clinicians should consider postprandial hyperkalemia risk when removing restrictions on dietary potassium intake in people with CKD on potassium binders.

What is known and what is new?

Enhancing potassium consumption lowers BP by direct effect on the vascular tone and stimulation of natriuresis. The recent large randomized controlled salt substitution and stroke study (SSaSS) trial reported that increasing potassium intake as a sodium substitute – that is, replacing 25% sodium chloride with potassium chloride in salt – reduces the risk of stroke, CVD and death in patients with increased cardiovascular risk and low potassium intake and high sodium intake at baseline. Potassium intake is reflective of healthy dietary patterns, as key sources of potassium include fruit, vegetables, nuts and legumes. The DASH diet recommends ∼4.7 g potassium per day, possibly accounting for the BP-lowering effect reported. Dietary potassium, potassium supplements and implementation of salt substitutes reduce BP with little effect on the risk of hyperkalaemia in a healthy population.

Unlike comprehensive interventions that require implementing and long-term adherence to dietary or behavioural change, the use of salt substitutes containing potassium salt and/or adoption of potassium-rich diet may represent a more feasible intervention to implement. Fruits, vegetables, legumes, fat-free or low-fat dairy foods and fish represent good natural dietary sources of potassium. Hyperkalaemia with higher potassium intake is a concern in certain populations such as people with advanced chronic kidney disease (excluded in the SSaSS trial), but the risk for developing clinically significant hyperkalaemia by increasing dietary potassium intake to recommended levels may be limited. These individuals are at higher risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes, and a modelling study demonstrates that there would be still a net benefit with consumption of a potassium salt in this setting.

International perspective

Estimates for potassium intake from cross-sectional studies show marked variations between countries ranging from 1.7 to 3.7 g per day, with highest consumption in Europe and lowest intakes in China and indicate that most populations may benefit from increasing their daily potassium intake. BP reduction may depend on the population's background potassium and sodium consumption. Implementation of potassium salt substitutes in countries where the main source of salt consists of added salt during cooking at the household level (discretionary use) is expected to be more feasible and also more efficacious as compared with countries with usually very high potassium intake and low sodium consumption. Importantly, a reduction of sodium salt consumption is paramount, as stated above, and the use of low-sodium salt substitutes should be encouraged.

### Worldwide and time trends in sodium and potassium intakes in children and adolescents: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114Sg8N8]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2025). High credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, this review suggests that Na and K intakes are inadequate in children and adolescents globally, as they are for adults. However, data are limited in certain regions of the world, especially in low- and middle-income countries, calling to improve population-based monitoring of these intakes. Promotion of adequate Na and K intakes should begin in childhood to promote optimal lifelong outcomes. Promotion of a healthy low-Na and high-K diet should start in childhood for optimal lifelong health.

### Estimated potassium intake and the progression of chronic kidney disease [^117EEzCc]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

KEY LEARNING POINTS

What was known:

Lower potassium intake is associated with an increased risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression in the general population.
Potassium intake restriction is recommended for hyperkalaemia in the CKD population.
However, there is no recommendation on potassium intake because there is limited evidence of the benefit from potassium intake in the CKD population.

This study adds:

Lower potassium intake is associated with an increased risk of CKD progression in the CKD population.
Potassium intake may reflect a better nutritional status, which may have beneficial effects on CKD progression.

Potential impact:

Overall potassium restriction for patients with CKD may deprive them of the beneficial effects associated with a healthy diet in potassium and other nutrients.
The best treatment for CKD is to support appropriate potassium intake on the basis of serum potassium concentrations and the patient's background, rather than restricting potassium intake uniformly and severely solely because of kidney disease.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for hyperkalemia, more specifically with respect to low-potassium diet, UKKA 2023 guidelines recommend to offer dietary strategies to modify potassium intake in non-hospitalized patients with CKD and persistent hyperkalemia with serum potassium > 5.5 mmol/L after addressing non-dietary causes of hyperkalemia, such as constipation, acidosis, and poorly controlled diabetes.
Offer dietary strategies to modify potassium intake for hospitalized patients with moderate or severe hyperkalemia after addressing non-dietary causes of hyperkalemia.

### Easy kidney-healthy recipes [^116JebjD]. Advances in Kidney Disease and Health (2023). Medium credibility.

As the diet for people with CKD changes based on new clinical trials, patients are not clear on how to accurately use their diet to protect their kidneys or best manage their electrolytes if they are on dialysis. They often make restrictions where they shouldn't and miss the dietary interventions that could actually make a difference. In this article, I present four recipes that can be tailored to any stage of kidney disease. They are low in sodium, easy to make at home, and can be adapted to low phosphorus, low protein, or low potassium diets as needed.

### Potassium-enriched salt substitutes: a review of recommendations in clinical management guidelines [^114YuGWC]. Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

The mechanistic rationale for increasing dietary potassium in BP control is explained in recent pretranslational studies. Potassium-rich diets reduce sodium reabsorption along the proximal and distal nephron, analogous to a diuretic, to promote sodium delivery to the collecting duct, which drives potassium secretion and excretion. Reciprocally, low-potassium diets provoke sodium reabsorption and retention to minimize delivery to the collecting duct reducing potassium secretion and excretion.

The chief problem with trying to reduce dietary sodium intake or increase dietary potassium intake is that the required changes by individuals, the food industry, and the government are mostly too difficult to achieve. Despite many efforts over many years, it has proved too hard to change consumer behaviors, reset the palates of populations, modify the food system, or persuade governments to implement regulatory instruments in the face of continued resistance from the food industry. Nonetheless, reducing dietary sodium and increasing dietary potassium remain public health priorities with huge potential for disease prevention. Novel approaches are required to address these priorities.

### Potassium additives and bioavailability: are we missing something in hyperkalemia management? [^117HsT2J]. Journal of Renal Nutrition (2019). Medium credibility.

Hyperkalemia and hyperphosphatemia are common metabolic disturbances in chronic kidney disease. Management may include instructions on a low-potassium or low-phosphorus diet, respectively. Low-phosphorus diet teaching includes information on phosphorus additives in addition to naturally occurring phosphorus food sources. Phosphorus additives are known to be more bioavailable compared with naturally occurring phosphorus. The concentration of phosphorus can also be much higher in processed foods compared with whole foods. Similar considerations may also be needed for dietary potassium teaching. The use of potassium additives in processed foods is growing, and when additives are used, the potassium concentration far exceeds naturally occurring potassium. Evidence also suggests, much like phosphate, potassium additives are more bioavailable than potassium found in whole foods. Clinicians and patients need to be aware of these changes in the food source to ensure potassium diet teaching is effective and safe.

### Dietary sodium and potassium intake in people with diabetes: are guidelines being met? [^111D3pTm]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2020). Medium credibility.

Potassium intake and the role of the sodium to potassium ratio

Only 5% of participants met dietary potassium intake guidelines. People with diabetes consume processed foods with high sodium contentswhich are most likely depleted of potassium. Males were more likely to meet guidelines consistent with previous studies demonstrating that whilst potassium intake is low globally, a sex difference for potassium exists. Potassium is considered to play a crucial role in cardiovascular health outcomes and deserves similar attention to sodium intake. Potassium intake has been shown to have an inverse relationship with blood pressure, with those in the highest range of potassium intake having the lowest blood pressure.

The ratio of sodium to potassium intake is considered more important on cardiovascular health outcomes than each factor alone. Lower sodium to potassium ratio is associated with lower blood pressure. Higher sodium to potassium ratio, consistent with high sodium intake and low potassium intake, as was seen in our study, is associated with adverse cardiovascular health outcomes.

Is there a range for optimal sodium intake?

Optimal dietary sodium targets are a matter of ongoing debate. Observational studies demonstrate that sodium intakes below 2645 mg (115 mmol/24 h) and above 4945 mg (215 mmol/24 h) are associated with higher mortality. The results of a meta-analysis supports these findings by comparing three sodium groups; high (> 5000 mg/24 h or 217 mmol/24 h), moderate (2700–5000 mg/24 h or 117–217 mmol/24 h) and low (< 2700 mg/24 h or 117 mmol/24 h), with the risk of a cardiovascular event. Whilst the high sodium group had the highest risk of an event and all-cause mortality, the moderate sodium group was found to be at lower risk of an event and all-cause mortality as compared with the low sodium group. Multiple observational studies report sodium intake between 115 mmol/24 h and 215 mmol/24 h may provide the best cardiovascular outcomes. It is reassuring that the majority of participants in the present study were consuming sodium within this range. Although the Institute of Medicineand the American Diabetes Associationno longer recommend very low sodium intakes of < 70 mmol/24 h in people with diabetes and recommend sodium intake of < 100 mmol/24 h consistent with the general population, in light of the aforementioned evidence and the demonstration in our study that people with diabetes are simply unable to meet these targets, these recommendations, may need to be further revised. Furthermore, randomized controlled trials assessing sodium intake and hard outcomes such as cardiovascular events and mortality are greatly needed.

### A practical approach to a low protein diet in Brazil [^111TSsi2]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

During the second nutritional appointment, which is held one week later, the following occur:
Answer possible questions about treatment goals, such as "How long will I need to do this diet?" or "With this diet, my kidney will function normally again?" or "When and how much can I eat fruits with more potassium?"
Deliver and explain the personalized nutritional plan, such as portions, replacement list, and cooking methods.
Adjust the appointment interval to 1, 2 or 3 months, depending on the patient's needs.

During the third nutritional appointment, the following occur:
Evaluation of weight and anthropometric changes.
Evaluation of LPD adherence through 24-h food recall and biochemical measurements, such as serum creatinine and urea, GFR and proteinuria. Every six months, a measurement of protein nitrogen appearance is requested; however, many economic problems can delay this requirement.
Adjustment of dietary prescription, if necessary. If adherence is considered "good" (protein intake between 90 and 110% of dietary prescription), nutritional appointments are made for every three months. If adherence is < 90% or > 110%, nutritional appointments occur for each month until the desirable LPD adherence is reached.

Key point

According to the NKF, regular monitoring at 1- to 3-month intervals (4 visits per year) should be a routine component of nutritional care.

In the subsequent appointments, the following occurs:
At each visit, a complete clinical, anthropometric and dietetic evaluation is performed and the dietary plan is adjusted, if necessary. A simplified scheme with routine nutritional care is described in Table 1.

Table 1
Routine of nutritional care

GFR glomerular filtration rate, BMI body mass index, %BF percentage of body fat, MAC muscle arm circumference, WC waist circumference, LPD low protein diet, PNA protein nitrogen appearance

Types of diets prescribed

Energy

A diet containing 35 kcal/kg/day for patients < 60 years old and 30 kcal/kg/day for patients > 60 years old is prescribed. For overweight and obese patients, 30 kcal/kg/day may be considered. For patients who need weight repletion, energy intake > 35 kcal/kg/day should be implemented.

### Effect of dietary potassium restriction on serum potassium, disease progression, and mortality in chronic kidney disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117HDskV]. Journal of Renal Nutrition (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

Low-potassium diets are recommended to reduce serum potassium (Sk) and prevent complications of chronic kidney disease (CKD), but evidence underpinning this recommendation has not been systematically reviewed and synthesized. We conducted a systematic review comparing change in Sk, CKD progression, and mortality between those on a low-potassium versus unrestricted potassium diet.

Methods

We searched Medline, AMED, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Clinicaltrials.org from inception to 3 April 2018. We included randomized and observational studies that compared these outcomes in adults with CKD who ate a restricted versus unrestricted amount of dietary potassium. We pooled mean change in Sk and adjusted hazard ratios of disease progression and mortality using random-effects meta-analyses.

Results

We identified 5,563 articles, of which seven studies (3,489 participants) met our inclusion criteria. We found very low-quality evidence that restricted (1,295 mg/d) versus unrestricted (1,570 mg/d) dietary potassium lowered Sk by -0.22 mEq/L (95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.33, -0.10; I² = 0%). Lower (1,725 mg/d) versus higher (4,558 mg/d) dietary potassium was not significantly associated with disease progression (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.14; 95% CI: 0.77, 1.70; I² = 57%). Lower (1,670 mg/d), compared with higher (4,414 mg/d) dietary potassium intake was associated with a 40% reduction in mortality hazard (HR: 0.60; 95% CI: 0.40, 0.89; I² = 56%).

Conclusions

Very-low-quality evidence supports consensus that dietary potassium restriction reduces Sk in normokalemia and is associated with a reduced risk of death in those with CKD. High-quality randomized controlled trials are needed.

### Potassium urinary excretion and dietary intake: a cross-sectional analysis in 8–10 year-old children [^116LHYCf]. BMC Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Background

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are the main contributor to mortality and morbidity globally, killing more people each year than all other causes combined. Because of the increasing prevalence of NCDs, dietary guidelines designed to promote public health have been instituted worldwide as an important part of national food and nutrition policies. Interventions that are well understood, cost effective, and feasible could counteract NCDs, since the most health-promoting diets do not require extraordinary effort, cost, or complexity and provide the recommended daily allowances of macro and micronutrients. Potassium (K +) is one of the key nutrients to prevent NCDs, and to preserve total body fluid volume, acid and electrolyte balance, and normal cell function. WHO suggests to adjust downward the recommended potassium intake of at least 3510 mg/day, based on the energy requirements of children relative to those of adults. Food rich in K +, such as fruits and vegetables, are recognized as key contributors to a healthy diet and are in line with food based dietary guidelines. In addition, processed foods are often lacking K +.

### Assessment and misassessment of potassium, phosphorus, and protein in the hemodialysis diet [^113hZr8j]. Seminars in Dialysis (2018). Low credibility.

Diet is a key determinant of several common and serious disease complications in hemodialysis (HD) patients. The recommended balance and variety of foods in the HD diet is designed to limit high potassium and phosphorus foods while maintaining protein adequacy. In this report, we examine the potassium, phosphorus, and protein content of foods, and identify critical challenges, and potential pitfalls when translating nutrient prescriptions into dietary guidelines. Our findings highlight the importance of individualized counseling based on a comprehensive dietary assessment by trained diet professionals, namely renal dietitians, for managing diet-related complications in HD patients.

### Top food category contributors to sodium and potassium intake-United States, 2015–2016 [^113QF1cA]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2020). Medium credibility.

Monitoring the food categories contributing to population sodium and potassium intake can inform cardiovascular disease prevention initiatives. Consuming foods naturally low in sodium (e.g. fruits and vegetables without added sodium) in place of foods that are high in sodium (e.g. prepared foods with added sodium) might have the dual benefit of decreasing sodium intake and increasing potassium intake. In addition, differences in top food categories contributing to sodium and potassium intake by race and Hispanic ethnicity indicate the need for dietary strategies that encompass the variability in foods consumed to reach populations at elevated risk for cardiovascular disease. Understanding the top food categories contributing to sodium and potassium intake informs individual and public health strategies to lower blood pressure and reduce cardiovascular disease risk.

CKD potassium-related implementation considerations — Potassium is widely distributed in foods but the main sources are fruits, vegetables, legumes and nuts, and efforts should be made to avoid restricting dietary potassium because reduced fiber can lead to constipation which could lower potassium excretion; if hyperkalemia cannot be reversed, the next step is to identify the most important dietary sources of potassium by interviewing the patient and dietary recalls, and clinicians preferably assisted by a renal dietitian should educate patients with hyperkalemia about fruits, vegetables, and other foods with low potassium content that ideally still contain higher levels of fiber and other micronutrients; in addition, potassium content in vegetables can be lowered by boiling and reductions in food taste and palatability associated with this strategy can be partially improved with the use of aromatic herbs; there are no obvious costs to adjusting dietary potassium intake; there is a scarcity of studies on this topic and we found no data on how modifying diet can influence serum potassium in patients with CKD, and factors other than dietary intake that influence serum potassium levels include medications, kidney function, hydration status, acid-base status, glycemic control, adrenal function, a catabolic state, or gastrointestinal problems like vomiting, diarrhea, constipation and bleeding, which should all be considered when formulating a strategy to keep the serum potassium within the normal range.

### CORRECTED ARTICLE: effect of dietary potassium restriction on serum potassium, disease progression, and mortality in chronic kidney disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113iPd3o]. Journal of Renal Nutrition (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Low-potassium diets are recommended to reduce serum potassium (Sk) and prevent complications of chronic kidney disease (CKD), but evidence underpinning this recommendation has not been systematically reviewed and synthesized. We conducted a systematic review comparing change in Sk, CKD progression, and mortality between those on a low-potassium versus unrestricted potassium diet.

Methods

We searched Medline, AMED, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Clinicaltrials.org from inception to 3 April 2018. We included randomized and observational studies that compared these outcomes in adults with CKD who ate a restricted versus unrestricted amount of dietary potassium. We pooled mean change in Sk and adjusted hazard ratios of disease progression and mortality using random-effects meta-analyses.

Results

We identified 5,563 articles, of which seven studies (3,489 participants) met our inclusion criteria. We found very low-quality evidence that restricted (1,295 mg/d) versus unrestricted (1,570 mg/d) dietary potassium lowered Sk by -0.22 mEq/L (95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.33, -0.10; I² = 0%). Higher (4,558 mg/d) versus lower (1,725 mg/d) dietary potassium was not significantly associated with disease progression (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.14, 95% CI: [0.77, 1.70] I² = 57%). Higher (4,414 mg/d) compared with lower (1,670 mg/d) dietary potassium intake was not significantly associated with reduced mortality risk (HR: 0.80, 95% CI: [0.46, 1.41] I² = 78%).

Conclusions

Very-low-quality evidence supports consensus that dietary potassium restriction reduces Sk in normokalemia but whether this is associated with risk of death in those with CKD is uncertain. High-quality randomized controlled trials are needed.

### An integrative review of the methodology and findings regarding dietary adherence in end stage kidney disease [^112jNkvr]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

The second key finding of this review is that indirect physiological measures (such as serum potassium, phosphate or interdialytic weight gain) have been used frequently to measure dietary adherence in ESKD. The obvious advantages of using serum markers are that they are relatively cheap, easy to obtain, and have a low patient burden. However, serum potassium and phosphate are strongly influenced by non-dietary factors such as residual renal function, constipation; adherence to prescribed medications, acid base balance and time between treatments, making them unreliable and inaccurate markers of dietary adherence. Future studies of dietary adherence in ESKD should ideally attempt to use direct observation and immediate quantification of dietary intake to provide the most accurate data on dietary intake. However, limited staffing, finances, and the inability to monitor patients for long time periods, make this approach unlikely to be implemented. For pragmatic reasons it is therefore suggested that a combination of indirect measures (eg interdialytic weight gain, urine volume and sodium) and subjective methods (such as dietitian assisted dietary recalls) be used instead to increase the rigour of the information collected. Improved reporting of dietary outcomes in future studies is also needed and future research should include comprehensive details of dietary intake as well as reporting the rate of adherence. This approach has been used in several recent studies, and provides superior quality information that could then be used to guide future dietary adherence interventions.

This review provides clinicians with estimates of the rate of adherence to the renal diet and is the third important finding of this review. Attempts to compare the estimated dietary adherence rates to other components of the ESKD treatment regimen are challenging however, because the renal diet contains many components. Overall, the weighted mean adherence rates to fluid, phosphate, potassium and carbohydrate recommendations were similar to rates of adherence in other medical conditions. For example, it is estimated that 50–70% of patients are expected to be adherent to their therapy irrespective of the disease, prognosis or setting. Previous research in people with chronic diseases (such as diabetes, hypertension or ischemic heart disease); or on other ESKD self-management components have also reported adherence rates of this magnitude. However, the low rate of adherence to the overall renal diet as well as to specific components such as energy, protein, sodium, total fat and fibre reported in this review suggests that designing interventions to improve dietary adherence in those with ESKD is required. Interventions to improve adherence are proposed to have a greater impact on patient health than any further improvements in medical technologies and treatments.

DIETARY POTASSIUM INTAKE

Rather than binding potassium after dietary intake, a more direct strategy against hyperkalaemia could be to prescribe a low potassium diet (Figure 1). In patients with a tendency to develop hyperkalaemia, a dietary potassium intake of < 3 g/day (< 77 mmol/day) is recommended. Of note, the general population and patients with CKD already consume a relatively low potassium diet. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis compared the effects of lower and higher dietary potassium intake in patients with CKD (including patients treated with dialysis) on serum potassium and mortality. This review found that a potassium-restricted diet (1295 mg/day) lowered serum potassium by 0.22 mmol/L compared with an unrestricted — but still low potassium — diet (1570 mg/day). Furthermore, a low potassium diet (1670 mg/day) was associated with a 40% reduction in mortality hazard compared with higher dietary potassium intake (4414 mg/day). However, the evidence to support these effects was classified as very low-quality evidence. A small randomized controlled trial analysed the effect of dietary potassium restriction for 2 years on nerve function in patients with CKD Stage G3 or G4. The intervention caused modest but significant reductions in dietary potassium intake (3272 versus 3874 g/day) and serum potassium (4.6 versus 4.8 mmol/L), which was sufficient to improve the total neuropathy score (the primary outcome). This study illustrates that dietary potassium restriction may have benefits beyond lowering serum potassium, although the study had several limitations. At the same time, emerging evidence indicates that higher dietary potassium intake may be beneficial, even for patients with CKD. To date, 11 cohort studies analysed the association between urinary potassium excretion (as a proxy for dietary intake) and kidney outcomes in patients with CKD. Although the majority of these studies showed that a higher urinary potassium excretion was associated with a lower risk of adverse kidney outcomes or mortality, this was not a consistent finding. To address the possibility of a causal link between dietary potassium depletion and kidney outcomes, we are currently conducting a randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled trial with potassium supplementation in patients with CKD. Higher dietary potassium intake has been shown to reduce blood pressure and the risk of stroke in subjects without CKD and prevents kidney damage in experimental models of CKD. Because a high potassium diet usually consists of fruits and vegetables, potassium-independent factors such as low animal protein, high-fiber content and an alkaline diet may also play a role. Indeed, a randomized clinical trial showed that both alkali treatment and fruits and vegetables can reduce kidney injury in patients with CKD. To take advantage of these effects, the need for clinical trials comparing a potassium-restricted diet with the combination of a potassium-liberalized diet and potassium binders in patients treated with haemodialysis has recently been emphasized.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) diet — observational evidence links dietary potassium intake with outcomes in CKD, noting that in a majority, surrogates of high potassium intake were associated with a lower risk of death or progression of kidney disease and that studies in CKD or end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) report weak associations between dietary potassium intake and potassium concentration; finally, given cardiovascular outcome associations with CKD related mineral bone disease, it is also reasonable to recommend a low inorganic phosphorus (i.e., phosphorus additives in processed packaged foods) diet for patients with evidence of progressive CKD.

Potassium and phosphorus food additives — barriers and labeling are highlighted, noting that one major barrier is the lack of transparent and accurate food labeling, and that although potassium is listed quantitatively in the Nutrition Facts Label, the standards for labeling require that the amount shown represents the minimum amount, allowing underreporting; phosphorus additives must be named, but not all phosphorus-containing additives contain the word "phos" and none of these jurisdictions require quantification of phosphorus content; in addition, low food literacy creates challenges in planning, selecting, and interpreting ingredients lists for additives, and culturally tailored educational strategies led by renal dietitians are described as key supports for patients and families.

### Why and how to implement sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium changes in food items and diets? [^116VqVT7]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2005). Low credibility.

The present average sodium intakes, approximately 3000–4500 mg/day in various industrialised populations, are very high, that is, 2-3-fold in comparison with the current Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) of 1500 mg. The sodium intakes markedly exceed even the level of 2500 mg, which has been recently given as the maximum level of daily intake that is likely to pose no risk of adverse effects on blood pressure or otherwise. By contrast, the present average potassium, calcium, and magnesium intakes are remarkably lower than the recommended intake levels (DRI). In USA, for example, the average intake of these mineral nutrients is only 35–50% of the recommended intakes. There is convincing evidence, which indicates that this imbalance, that is, the high intake of sodium on one hand and the low intakes of potassium, calcium, and magnesium on the other hand, produce and maintain elevated blood pressure in a big proportion of the population. Decreased intakes of sodium alone, and increased intakes of potassium, calcium, and magnesium each alone decrease elevated blood pressure. A combination of all these factors, that is, decrease of sodium, and increase of potassium, calcium, and magnesium intakes, which are characteristic of the so-called Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diets, has an excellent blood pressure lowering effect. For the prevention and basic treatment of elevated blood pressure, various methods to decrease the intake of sodium and to increase the intakes of potassium, calcium, and magnesium should be comprehensively applied in the communities. The so-called 'functional food/nutraceutical/food-ceutical' approach, which corrects the mineral nutrient composition of extensively used processed foods, is likely to be particularly effective in producing immediate beneficial effects. The European Union and various governments should promote the availability and use of such healthier food compositions by tax reductions and other policies, which make the healthier choices cheaper than the conventional ones. They should also introduce and promote the use of tempting nutrition and health claims on the packages of healthier food choices, which have an increased content of potassium, calcium, and/or magnesium and a lowered content of sodium. Such pricing and claim methods would help the consumers to choose healthier food alternatives, and make composition improvements tempting also for the food industry.

Low phosphate diets

Restriction of dietary phosphate intake is recommended for all adults with ESKD in an attempt to lower the deranged serum phosphate levels. Of the 15 studies that reported low phosphate diet adherence rates, the majority (13 studies) used serum phosphate to measure dietary adherence, and found that rates varied between 43.5%–84.5%. More than half of these studies reported an adherence rate of greater than 70%, with younger people having lower adherence rates (44.8%) when compared to older people (68.8%).

Two studies which measured low phosphate diet adherence used food recalls or food records to obtain data on dietary phosphate intake and neither study reported the proportion of inorganic to organic phosphate intake, an important emerging component of dietary phosphate management. In the only study retrieved that compared the rate of adherence to the low phosphate diet using two different methods, Elliott et al. found that adherence was 32.6% when using a self-report survey on adoption of the low phosphate diet (the Precaution Adoption Process Model tool), compared with an adherence rate of 43.8% using serum phosphate.

Low potassium diets

A low potassium diet is recommended for adults with ESKD, and is used to prevent the potentially fatal complication of chronic hyperkalemia. Serum potassium was the most frequently reported method for measuring adherence to the low potassium diet, and only one study used a food recall to determine low potassium dietary adherence. All 12 studies of low potassium diet adherence were conducted on in people undertaking hemodialysis, highlighting an obvious lack of research regarding low potassium diet adherence in those undertaking home hemodialysis and in those with CKD.

### Effects of different dietary interventions on blood pressure: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^111CAP7J]. Hypertension (2016). Low credibility.

Previous studies have shown beneficial effects of individual dietary approaches for blood pressure (BP) control, but their relative effectiveness is not well established. We performed a systematic review of published dietary pattern interventions and estimated the aggregate BP effects through meta-analysis. PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science databases were searched to identify studies published between January 1, 1990 and March 1, 2015. Studies meeting specific inclusion and exclusion criteria were selected. Data were pooled using random effects meta-analysis models. Twenty-four trials with 23 858 total participants were included. The overall pooled net effect of dietary intervention on systolic BP and diastolic BP was -3.07 mm Hg (95% confidence interval, -3.85 to -2.30) and -1.81 mm Hg (95% confidence interval, -2.24 to -1.38), respectively. The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diet had the largest net effect (systolic BP, -7.62 mm Hg [95% confidence interval, -9.95 to -5.29] and diastolic BP, -4.22 mm Hg [95% confidence interval, -5.87 to -2.57]). Low-sodium; low-sodium, high-potassium; low-sodium, low-calorie; and low-calorie diets also led to significant systolic and diastolic BP reductions, whereas Mediterranean diet participants experienced a significant incremental reduction in diastolic but not systolic BP. Subgroup analysis also showed important variations in effectiveness based on duration, size, and participant demographics. In conclusion, dietary modifications are associated with clinically meaningful, though variable, reductions in BP. Some diets are more effective than others and under different circumstances, which has important implications from both clinical and public health perspectives.

### Effects of potassium or sodium supplementation on mineral homeostasis: a controlled dietary intervention study [^115QQdi6]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

The Western diet is characterized by a high sodium and low potassium content, and it has been associated with noncommunicable diseases such as hypertension, cardiovascular, chronic kidney, and mineral and bone disorders. More specifically, high intake of sodium and low intake of potassium have been linked with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality. Mechanistically, these associations are likely at least in part mediated by blood pressure, but additional factors may be involved.

Deregulations in bone and mineral metabolism, including hyperphosphatemia, 25-hydroxy vitamin D 3 (25[OH]-vitamin D 3) deficiency, hyperparathyroidism, and high levels of the phosphaturic hormone fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), have been associated with adverse outcomes in various populations. 25[OH]-vitamin D 3 is converted to biological active 1,25[OH]2-vitamin D 3 predominantly in the kidneys by 1-α-hydroxylase. Active vitamin D stimulates calcium and phosphate reabsorption in the gut, thus increasing plasma calcium. 25[OH]-vitamin D 3 deficiency may lead to decreased plasma calcium, which triggers PTH production. PTH increases bone resorption of calcium, suppresses renal phosphate reabsorption, and increases conversion of vitamin D. FGF23 inhibits renal phosphate reabsorption and 1-α-hydroxylase, inhibiting conversion of 25[OH]-vitamin D 3 to 1,25[OH]2-vitamin D 3. Vitamin D, PTH, and FGF23 are part of intertwined feedback loops regulating the calcium and phosphate balance.

FGF23 is more and more identified to be a cardiovascular-related detrimental factor, and several strategies to reduce FGF23 levels have been studied extensively. Interestingly, recent studies suggest that lower potassium intake is associated with a higher FGF23 level and that changes in potassium or sodium homeostasis may influence bone and mineral parameters and bone health. A study found that a varying amount of salt and a Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diet, which is among other things high in potassium, could improve bone turnover markers and calcium metabolism. However, the specific effects of altered potassium or sodium intake on bone and mineral parameters, and particularly calcium/phosphate-regulating hormones including FGF23, in humans remain unclear.

Here, we performed a post hoc analysis in a dietary controlled randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled crossover trial in prehypertensive individuals. In the current study, we investigated the effects of sodium or potassium supplementation, in the context of a controlled diet, on bone and mineral parameters.

### Nutritional and dietary management of chronic kidney disease under conservative and preservative kidney care without dialysis [^115t2RNX]. Journal of Renal Nutrition (2023). Medium credibility.

Another key consideration in the practical implementation of these dietary interventions is their pairing with evidence-based pharmacotherapies. As one example, while the traditional paradigm has been to restrict dietary potassium intake in moderate-to-advanced CKD given concerns about the ill effects of hyperkalemia, there is lack of evidence to support the benefits of this practice, and limited observational data have shown weak associations between dietary potassium intake and serum potassium levels. Furthermore, restricting heart-healthy fruits and vegetables and dietary patterns with a greater potassium content (i.e. DASH, PLADO/plant-focused low-protein diet for chronic kidney disease in diabetes diets) could potentially have negative effects on the cardiovascular health and survival of patients with CKD. In a retrospective analysis of 3,172 NHANES participants with kidney dysfunction who underwent dietary potassium and fiber intake assessment by 24-hour dietary recall, those who had concomitant low potassium and fiber intake had higher death risk versus those with high potassium and fiber consumption. Similarly, in a multicenter prospective observational study of 415 hemodialysis patients who underwent protocolized FFQs, lower dietary potassium intake was associated with worse survival. Hence, the utilization of novel potassium binders (if available) may allow for liberalization of dietary potassium intake to support greater consumption of PLADO diets, as well as continuing reno-protective renin-angiotensin-aldosterone inhibitors and nonselective steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists and avoiding/delaying the need for renal replacement therapy. Additionally, low-protein diets may have synergistic effects when used in conjunction with renin-angiotensin-aldosterone inhibitor and novel sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors in attenuating proteinuria and CKD progression.

### Chronic kidney disease increases the susceptibility to negative effects of low and high potassium intake [^111NWidE]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

In addition to the health effects of dietary K + in people with CKD, another relevant and more physiological question is how CKD modifies the response to dietary K +. Several previous studies in animals have characterized the effects of low and high K + diets, but few of these studies were conducted in animal models of CKD. In addition, no studies have directly compared the effects of low and high K + diets in animals with normal kidney function and animals with CKD. From these previous studies, it is clear that a low K + diet causes a form of kidney injury that is characterized by inflammation and fibrosis ("kaliopenic nephropathy"). In addition, a low K + diet activates the so-called K + switch, which increases the activity of the sodium-chloride cotransporter (NCC). This response helps to conserve K + but can also cause salt-sensitive hypertension. In the 5/6th nephrectomy (5/6Nx) model of CKD, a K + -deficient diet exaggerated proximal tubular hypertrophy compared with normal rats. A high K + diet is able to relieve part of the kidney injury induced by a low K + or high sodium chloride diet. Moreover, a high K + diet inactivates NCC leading to K + -induced natriuresis with lowering of blood pressure. However, a chronic high K + diet in mice can cause hypertension even in the presence of NCC inhibition. The same hypertensive response to a high K + diet has been reported in 5/6Nx rats. In contrast, Wang et al. found that a high K + diet decreased blood pressure and kidney injury compared with a normal K + diet in 5/6Nx rats. It is important to emphasize that different percentages of KCl were used in these previous studies, including ranges of 0%–0.5% for the low K + diet, 0.4%–1.0% for the normal K + diet and 2.6%–7.6% for the high K + diet. Of note, if the recommendations for adequate dietary K + intake in humans (90–120 mmol/day) are translated to rodents, a normal K + diet would be 0.1% KCl.

The aim of the present study was to compare the effects of a low, normal and high K + diet in normal rats and rats with CKD using the 5/6Nx model. The effects of these diets on plasma electrolyte and acid–base levels, intracellular K + concentrations, blood pressure, kidney function and kidney histology were analyzed.

Special populations — children require careful balancing of dietary potassium and phosphorus intake to support growth and development; excess from additives can be harmful due to a smaller body size and lower nutrient thresholds; hyperkalemia risk may be influenced by stooling patterns (e.g., constipation and fiber intake), medications, or malnutrition-induced tissue breakdown, while hypophosphatemia can occur from tubular losses, dialysis, or diuretics — potentially impairing growth, muscle function, and bone health and bone growth; it is important to consider age-appropriate normative values for serum phosphorus to avoid severe excessive restrictions in phosphorus intake; possible approaches include mixing normal and low-phosphorus-containing formulas, supplementing an oral diet with low-phosphorus oral nutrient supplements, or teaching families to prepare simple recipes with minimally processed ingredients; parents, guardians, or family members involved in purchasing and preparing food must also be educated in addition to pediatric patients within the context of maturity and understanding.

### Beyond sodium, phosphate and potassium: potential dietary interventions in kidney disease [^1145wHNQ]. Seminars in Dialysis (2017). Low credibility.

People with kidney disease are advised to restrict individual nutrients, such as sodium, potassium, and phosphate, in line with current best practice guidelines. However, there is limited evidence to support the efficacy of single nutrient strategies, and compliance remains a challenge for clinicians to overcome. Many factors contribute to poor compliance with dietary prescriptions, including conflicting priorities for single nutrient restriction, the arduous self-monitoring required, and the health-related knock-on effects resulting from targeting these nutrients in isolation. This paper reviews the evidence base for the overall pattern of eating as a potential tool to deliver a diet intervention in which all the nutrients and foods work cumulatively and synergistically to improve clinical outcomes. These interventions may assist in kidney disease management and overcome these innate challenges that single nutrient interventions possess. Healthy dietary patterns are typically plant-based and lower in sodium and animal proteins. These patterns may have numerous mechanistic benefits for cardiovascular health in kidney disease, most notably through the increase in fruit, vegetables, and plant-based protein, as well as improved gut health through the increase in dietary fiber. The evidence to date on optimal dietary patterns points toward use of a predominantly plant-based diet, and suggests its adoption may improve clinical outcomes in dialysis patients. However, clinical trials are needed to determine whether these diet interventions are feasible, safe, and effective in this patient population.

### Translation of nutrient level recommendations to control serum phosphate into food-based advice [^115qwapQ]. Journal of Renal Nutrition (2021). Medium credibility.

The control of hyperphosphatemia is key to the management of chronic kidney disease mineral and bone disorder. Dietary restriction of phosphorus is essential to control hyperphosphatemia. Guidelines for chronic kidney disease and end-stage kidney disease generally provide high-level guidance on whether a nutrient should be restricted e.g., restrict dietary phosphorus. Dietitians translate such guidance into nutrient-based strategies and finally into food-based practical dietary advice for patients to follow. The practical aspects of dietary advice are not well described in the literature, neither are the challenges of concurrently altering 1 nutrient e.g., phosphorus while continuing to restrict others e.g., potassium, while maintaining overall nutritional adequacy and quality of life. In this article, we describe how we translated updated nutrient level recommendations into practical dietary advice to be delivered at the bedside.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of chronic kidney disease [^114NorNf]. VA/DoD (2025). High credibility.

Dietary considerations for CKD with hyperkalemia note that people are commonly advised to follow low-potassium diets, yet randomized evidence about whether this approach is effective is lacking. In the early stages of CKD, a high intake of foods naturally rich in potassium appears to be protective against disease progression, and restricting fruits and vegetables may be harmful to health. Observational data indicate that in a majority, surrogates of high potassium intake were associated with a lower risk of death or progression of kidney disease, and studies in CKD or ESKD report weak associations between dietary potassium intake and potassium concentration. Plant-based foods may yield lower net bioavailable potassium due to effects on absorption and distribution, whereas highly processed foods, meats, dairy products, juices, and salt substitutes made with potassium chloride are higher in absorbable potassium. The KDIGO 2024 guideline recommends, "Provide advice to limit the intake of foods rich in bioavailable potassium (e.g., processed foods) for people with CKD G3-G5 who have a history of hyperkalemia".

### Optimal diet for cardiovascular and planetary health [^112an5Tq]. Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

The intake of carbohydrates and proteins in relation to CVD has been mostly addressed in studies on low-carb/high-protein diets. These diets are characterised — as the name already conveys — by a (very) low intake of carbohydrates and a high intake of proteins. A very low carb diet (ketogenic diet) has been shown to contribute to glycaemic and lipid control and contributes significantly to weight loss in patients with type 2 diabetes. However, when considering long-term effects, there is currently insufficient evidence to recommend such diets to improve cardiovascular health. They may even be associated with increased all-cause mortality when used for extended periods. With respect to carbohydrates, we distinguish simple carbohydrates (monosaccharides and disaccharides, sugars) and complex carbohydrates (polysaccharides, starch). Refined carbohydrates are often depleted of their vitamin, mineral and fibre content. Unrefined complex carbohydrates take longer to break down and therefore impact blood glucose level more slowly, which is important for cardiovascular health.

Vitamins and minerals

Sodium and potassium are the most important minerals for CVD prevention due to their effect on BP. Although the relation between sodium (table salt) intake and BP has recently been questioned, the totality of evidence still warrants sodium reduction as an important way to prevent CVD. In most Western countries, sodium intake is high (around 3.6–4 g/day corresponding to 9–10 g of salt), whereas the recommended maximum intake is 2 g/day (5 g/day salt) and optimal intake levels might be as low as around 1.2 g/day (3 g/day salt). Potassium has favourable effects on BP, and a higher intake of potassium has been shown to reduce the risk of incident stroke. Main sources of potassium are fruits, vegetables, whole grains and meat.

Evidence for a protective effect of vitamins (vitamin A, B6, B12, C, D, E and folic acid) is not yet conclusive.

### KDIGO 2021 clinical practice guideline for the management of blood pressure in chronic kidney Disease [^113Akzri]. Kidney International (2021). High credibility.

KDIGO 2021 blood pressure in chronic kidney disease (CKD) — dietary sodium reduction targets and strength are specified as follows: For adults with CKD, the Work Group considered sodium < 2 g (< 90 mmol)/d reasonable and stated that Work Group members agree a target of < 2.0 g per day should be recommended for CKD populations; CKD intervention studies typically targeted < 2 g or < 2.3 g daily. The recommendation is weak because, in controlled trials, only a minority of patients reached a target intake of < 2 g (< 90 mmol) of sodium per day, and effects on important clinical outcomes in CKD are uncertain. In children with CKD, decreasing dietary sodium intake is likely appropriate with modified targets; specific targets are not available, and adjusting the < 2 g (< 90 mmol) daily target for body weight in children would be reasonable. Additional considerations include that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) benefits may be enhanced with a low-sodium diet, post hoc analyses indicate low-sodium intake may enhance the effects of these medications on kidney and CV outcomes, the magnitude of blood pressure reduction for a given sodium reduction is magnified in hypertensive individuals, and although there is a lack of RCT data on potassium-containing salt substitutes in CKD populations, Work Group members are concerned about the risk of hyperkalemia.

### Adherence to the planetary health diet index and correlation with nutrients of public health concern: an analysis of NHANES 2003–2018 [^115XvbmH]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2024). Medium credibility.

Because the Planetary Health Diet Index (PHDI) is a novel dietary measure, and because it has several key differences from the DGAs, we tested the correlation of PHDI with the adequacy of key micronutrients of public health concern in the United States. We decided to evaluate iron because animal-sourced foods are a major source of dietary iron and calcium in the typical American diet, whereas the PHDI recommends a low intake of most animal-sourced foods. Other micronutrients of concern that are lacking in many American diets are calcium, potassium, fiber, and vitamin D. In nationally representative data, the prevalence of inadequacy among United States adults was estimated to be 95% for fiber, 70% for potassium, and 44% for calcium. Although a shift toward the EAT- Lancet universal healthy reference diet would likely improve intakes of fiber and potassium given that vegetables, beans, legumes, and fruit are rich sources of these micronutrients, the impact on calcium and iron intakes is uncertain and evidence on the recommendation's correlation with nutrient intake in real-world settings is limited.

The objectives of this study were to assess how the United States diet aligns with the PHDI, a novel index based on the evidence presented by the EAT- Lancet Commission, and to examine changes in accordance with the PHDI between 2003 and 2018 for the entire dietary pattern and its constituent components. We further assess how PHDI correlates with inadequacy for key nutrients of public health concern in the United States (iron, fiber, potassium, and calcium).

### Top food category contributors to sodium and potassium intake-United States, 2015–2016 [^114FXmiw]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2020). Medium credibility.

Most U.S. adults consume too much sodium and not enough potassium (1,2). For apparently healthy U.S. adults aged ≥ 19 years, guidelines recommend reducing sodium intake that exceeds 2,300 mg/day and consuming at least 3,400 mg/day of potassium for males and at least 2,600 mg/day for females* (1). Reducing population-level sodium intake can reduce blood pressure and prevent cardiovascular diseases, the leading causes of death in the United States (1,3). Adequate potassium intake might offset the hypertensive effects of excessive sodium intake (1). Data from the 2015–2016 What We Eat in America (WWEIA) dietary interview component of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) † were analyzed to identify top food categories contributing to sodium and potassium intake for U.S. residents aged ≥ 1 year. During 2015–2016, 40% of sodium consumed came from the top 10 food categories, which included prepared foods with sodium added (e.g., deli meat sandwiches and pizza). Approximately 43% of potassium consumed was from 10 food categories, which included foods naturally low in sodium (e.g., unflavored milk, fruit, vegetables) and prepared foods. These results can inform efforts to encourage consumption of foods naturally low in sodium, which might have the dual benefit of reducing sodium intake and increasing potassium intake, contributing to cardiovascular disease prevention.

### Healthy eating tips | Nutrition… [^116igsEZ]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Most people in the United States need to eat more foods with dietary fiber, calcium, vitamin D, and potassium, according to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. At the same time, we need to consume less added sugar, saturated fat, and sodium. Here are some ways to get started. To increase calcium and vitamin D intake, try this:

- Drink a fortified dairy beverage with your meals.
- Add sardines to your lunch once a week.
- Canned salmon is another great option.
- Sardines and salmon with bones have more calcium than these products without bones.
- Canned salmon is another great option.
- Cook with spinach, collard greens, bok choy, mushrooms, and taro root.
- Look for foods that are fortified with calcium and vitamin D.
- Fortified foods may include soy beverages, soy yogurt, orange juice, and some whole-grain cereals.
- Just be sure they don't include added sugars.
- Fortified foods may include soy beverages, soy yogurt, orange juice, and some whole-grain cereals.

Add more potassium Potassium helps the kidneys, heart, muscles and, nerves function properly. Not getting enough potassium can increase blood pressure, deplete calcium in bones, and increase the risk of kidney stones. People with chronic kidney disease and people taking certain medications may have too much potassium in their blood. But most people in the United States need to consume more potassium. See food sources of potassium. To add more potassium, try this:

- Try new recipes that use beets, lima beans, or Swiss chard.
- Try a variety of drinks high in potassium.
- 100% prune, pomegranate, or orange juice.
- Fat-free milk and low-fat kefir.
- 100% prune, pomegranate, or orange juice.
- Have a banana as a snack. To cut back on sodium, try this:

- Find alternatives to salt to add flavor to your meals.
- A squeeze of lemon juice.
- A dash of no-salt spice blends.
- Fresh herbs.
- A squeeze of lemon juice.
- Eat high-sodium processed and prepackaged food less frequently.
- Common foods with high sodium include breads, pizza, and deli meats.
- Common foods with high sodium include breads, pizza, and deli meats.
- Read the Nutrition Facts label to find foods low in sodium.
- Buy unprocessed food to prepare at home without salt.
- Good options include fresh or frozen vegetables.
- Good options include fresh or frozen vegetables.

### Potassium-enriched salt substitutes: a review of recommendations in clinical management guidelines [^112FCAPU]. Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Higher levels of dietary sodium intake and lower levels of dietary potassium intake are both associated with raised blood pressure (BP) and increased risks of cardiovascular disease and premature death. – There is a strong evidence base indicating that both reducing sodium intake and increasing potassium intake will reduce these risks through their BP-lowering effects. As a consequence, multiple authoritative bodies acknowledge these risks, and have made recommendations related to sodium and potassium intake. The World Health Organization (WHO), for example, has guidelines that make strong population-wide recommendations to reduce sodium intake and increase potassium intake. For sodium, the WHO has also explicitly proposed that all member states reduce mean population intake by 30% by 2025, with a target maximum intake of 2.0-g/day sodium (5.0-g/day salt), in support of global efforts to reduce the noncommunicable disease burden by one quarter.

Mean global sodium intake was recently estimated to be 4.3 g/day, which equates to about 10.8 g/day of table salt. The most recent corresponding estimated value for mean global potassium intake is about 2.3 g/day. These current intake values are substantially different from norms during hominid evolution when the estimated intake of sodium was about 0.5 g/day and the estimated potassium intake was about 10 g/day. Current sodium consumption varies substantially between populations with the estimated intake highest in the WHO Western Pacific region (6.2-g/day sodium and 15.6-g/day salt) driven by high consumption levels in China and lowest in Africa (2.7-g/day sodium and 6.7-g/day salt; Figure).

### Blood pressure interactions with the DASH dietary pattern, sodium, and potassium: the international study of macro-/ micronutrients and blood pressure (INTERMAP) [^112pFCt9]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Urinary metabolic signatures associated with the 24-hour dietary DASH scores and urinary excretion of sodium and potassium were characterized, and their interactions and possible nutrient-related pathways proposed. Consistent with previous reports, an inverse association between higher adherence to the DASH diet and BP was found. Excretion of potassium was strongly associated with the DASH score, and potassium adjustment attenuated the DASH-BP relationship. The connection between DASH scores and urinary potassium is likely derived from increased fruit, vegetable, and dairy intakes in the DASH diet, resulting in increased dietary potassium. This may explain the overlap between the DASH diet and potassium intake in lowering BP. Although reduced sodium intake has previously been showed to ameliorate the DASH diet's impact on BP, in this investigation, sodium did not appear to attenuate the DASH-BP relation. Possible explanations include the relatively high sodium intake among US participants (only 12.5% of them met the CDRR level for sodium) and the fact that the high potassium content, or possibly the calcium content, of the DASH diet attenuated the effects of low sodium intake. Since sodium and potassium are both key drivers of the renin-angiotensin system, there may be some redundancy when targeting this pathway.

### Twenty-four-hour urinary sodium and potassium excretion in China: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117Fq8bK]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

A high‐sodium, low‐potassium diet leads to elevated blood pressure and ultimately cardiovascular disease, 1, 2, 3 which is the major cause of death and disability in China and the rest of the world. 4, 5 The World Health Organization recommends that all adults reduce their sodium intake to < 87 mmol (< 5 g of salt) per day and increase their potassium intake to ≥ 90 mmol (≥ 3.5 g) per day, and the recommendations for children are adjusted for their energy requirements and age. 6, 7 In China, the average diet contains too much sodium and not enough potassium, 8 and strategies to address this situation remain limited. 9 Moreover, current figures for sodium and potassium intakes in China lack accuracy, as they are often estimated with unreliable methods, such as dietary recalls, food records, or spot urines. The most accurate way to assess sodium and potassium intake is 24‐hour urine collection. 10, 11 A great number of studies have reported such data in China, but there has been no systematic review to comprehensively assess them.

Given the large share of the world's cardiovascular disease burden borne by China — particularly in the form of elevated blood pressure and stroke — and the need to track progress on global targets, more robust estimates of sodium and potassium intake are urgently needed. Therefore, our study aimed to determine sodium and potassium intake in China by systematically searching for and quantitatively summarizing all published data on 24‐hour urinary sodium and potassium excretion in children and adults.

### Nutritional issues with incremental dialysis: the role of low-protein diets [^1118j6Wp]. Seminars in Dialysis (2017). Low credibility.

A gentle start of dialysis is a welcome possibility for both patients and physicians. Incident dialysis patients often maintain residual kidney function (RKF) for a considerable period of time; the start of dialysis is often driven mainly by uremic symptoms. Recently, the combination of a low-protein diet, along with a less-frequent dialysis schedule, has regained interest as an alternative option in selected and motivated patients. In addition, there is renewed interest in a low-protein diet in patients with moderate to advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD). Dietary regimens have additional objectives now: obtaining better control of phosphate and potassium levels; preventing or reducing metabolic acidosis, protein catabolism, and malnutrition; and reducing uremic symptoms. In the eighties and early nineties, data from uncontrolled studies showed that combining a very low-protein diet with once weekly hemodialysis was a feasible approach. However, these diets were very demanding with poor patient compliance and had a high risk of smoldering malnutrition. However, recent experience has shown that the new protein-free foods have better palatability and nutritional properties; this has increased adherence to dietary prescriptions. Dietary regimens are now tailored to the patient's needs and habits. A multidisciplinary approach is considered crucial for updating medical needs and dietary prescriptions, ensuring adherence to the combined program, and avoiding the development of malnutrition and inadequate dialysis. Monitoring RKF is another key factor for the success of the program due to the importance of optimal timing of the transition to twice-weekly regimens and, eventually, thrice-weekly hemodialysis.

### Dietary sources and correlates of sodium and potassium intakes in the French general population [^1145dYSx]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2009). Low credibility.

Background/Objectives

To investigate the dietary sources of sodium and potassium and to explore the biological, behavioural and socio-demographic factors associated with a high sodium and low potassium diet in a general population.

Subjects/Methods

Cross-sectional dietary survey carried out in 1998 and 1999 in nationally representative samples of adults (n = 1474) and children (n = 1018). Daily sodium and potassium intakes were estimated using a 7-day food record after exclusion of underreporters.

Results

Mean sodium intake was well above, whereas mean potassium intake was largely below the current recommendations in adults and children. The consumption of a high sodium and low potassium diet appeared very early in life and increased up to adulthood, especially in men living in small communities. Despite the fact that sodium and potassium intakes were positively correlated to each other and to total food intake, several food categories showed a sodium/potassium intake ratio well above one (cheeses, cooked pork meats, breads, breakfast cereals, soups, fast foods, pastries and sugary products) whereas others presented a ratio well below one (fruits, vegetables, dairy products, meats and hot beverages).

Conclusions

High sodium and low potassium intakes were widespread in the population. The fact that the main dietary sources of sodium and potassium were, for the most part, not the same demonstrates the feasibility of simultaneously decreasing sodium intake and increasing potassium intake at the individual level.

### Effect of increased potassium intake on cardiovascular risk factors and disease: systematic review and meta-analyses [^114fPdA6]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Non-communicable diseases are the leading cause of death globally, killing more people each year than all other causes combined. Elevated blood pressure and hypertension are major risk factors for cardiovascular diseases, especially coronary heart disease, stroke, and heart failure, as well as renal failure. Although non-communicable diseases disproportionately affect adults, they and their risk factors are becoming more prevalent in paediatric populations. Diet related non-communicable diseases may take years or decades to manifest, and delaying the onset of these diseases could improve lives and result in substantial cost savings. Much of the human and social impact caused each year by morbidity and mortality related to non-communicable diseases could be averted through interventions that are well understood, cost effective, and feasible.

Potassium is an essential nutrient that is needed for maintenance of total body fluid volume, acid and electrolyte balance, and normal cell function. In the pre-agricultural and post-agricultural diets of our human ancestors, potassium intake was very high, often exceeding 200 mmol/day. In modern society, these levels have been markedly reduced. Food processing reduces the potassium content of food, and a diet high in processed foods and low in fresh fruits and vegetables is often lacking in potassium. Data from around the world suggest that the average potassium consumption in many countries is below 70–80 mmol/day, the value recommended by the 2002 Joint World Health Organization (WHO)/Food and Agriculture Organization Expert Consultation, and even fewer countries report an average consumption of 90 mmol/day as recommended by countries such as the United Kingdom, Spain, Mexico, and Belgium. No countries report an average population consumption of 120 mmol/day as recommended by the United States, Canada, Republic of Korea, and Bulgaria. Lower potassium consumption has been associated with elevated blood pressure, hypertension, and stroke, and higher levels of consumption could be protective against these conditions.

### Chronic kidney disease increases the susceptibility to negative effects of low and high potassium intake [^111xRRKF]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

The strength of this study is the direct comparison between the effects of low, normal and high K + diets in rats with normal kidney function and rats with CKD. The high K + diets had no clear negative effects in the rats with normal kidney function, whereas previous studies did show that mice on a high K + diet developed hypertension. This may be explained by a species difference or difference in the magnitude of K + supplementation. We also acknowledge a number of limitations of our study. First, the multi-group comparison forced us to make choices and therefore we tested KCitrate only as high K + diet and measured the intracellular K + concentrations only in rats on the low and high K + diets. Only male rats were used in order to limit the number of animals and the blood pressure variability related to sex hormones. However, given the emerging insights on the importance of sex differences in tubular transport and hypertension, future studies should also include female rats. We tested the diets only in the 5/6Nx model of CKD and it therefore remains to be determined to what degree our results also apply to other experimental CKD models or to human CKD. Finally, we used less extreme K + diets than in previous studies, but acknowledge that they are still supraphysiological. Indeed, the 2.5% K + diets for rats in our experimental conditions result in a 25-fold higher potassium intake compared with a regular diet for rats, which is outside the range of physiological variations in humans. Therefore, these results should be interpreted with caution.

In conclusion, CKD increases susceptibility to the negative effects of low and high K + diets but leads to different injury patterns including inflammation, fibrosis and kidney function decline with the low K + diet and hyperaldosteronism, hypertension and fibrosis on the high K + diet. Our results suggest that especially in people with CKD it is important to establish the optimal threshold of dietary K + intake to avoid the negative effects of a low and high K + diet.

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^112j8XhC]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

Diet — CKD: Practice Point 3.3.1: Advise people with CKD to adopt healthy and diverse diets with a higher consumption of plant-based foods compared to animal-based foods and a lower consumption of ultraprocessed foods. Practice Point 3.3.2: Use renal dietitians or accredited nutrition providers to educate people with CKD about dietary adaptations regarding sodium, phosphorus, potassium, and protein intake, tailored to their individual needs, and severity of CKD and other comorbid conditions. Diets such as Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) are rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and low-fat dairy foods, and a Mediterranean diet pattern is built around vegetables, fruits, herbs, nuts, beans, whole grains, and seafood but also includes moderate amounts of dairy, meat, and eggs; a whole-food, plant-based diet low in animal-based and ultra-processed foods may be helpful to slow the progression of CKD and delay need for dialysis via reduction of cardiometabolic risk factors, while ultraprocessed foods are high in salt, sugar, and fat, low in nutritional value, and promote inflammation. A recent systematic review reported that dietary patterns including more plant-based unprocessed protein have been demonstrated, in cohort studies and small RCTs, to slow the trajectory of eGFR decline, reduce the risk of kidney failure, reduce risk of mortality, and improve scores in some QoL domains.

### Diets for patients with chronic kidney disease, should we reconsider? [^111Fx1hj]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions

We conclude that integrating dietary manipulations into a comprehensive strategy will help prevent or ameliorate complications of CKD including acidosis, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia and uremic symptoms and possibly influence CKD progression. We believe particular attention should be paid: 1) to correcting metabolic acidosis with either sodium bicarbonate supplements or more simply with diet instructions how to include supplements of fruits and vegetables; and 2) to lower the intake of sodium chloride as well as phosphates by choosing foods that provide low contents of these ions. Changing the diet by concentrating on these dietary constituents will allow us to maximize the renoprotective anti-proteinuric effect of renin angiotensin system blockers. These considerations on dietary approaches for CKD prevention and management are particularly valuable for low-resource setting worldwide where patients with CKD are beset with numerous challenges often traceable to poverty and a lack of access to life-saving dialysis and transplantation. The feasibility of these management approaches for CKD and its risk factors even in low-income countries is exemplified by the program set up in the communities of Eastern Nepal in collaboration with the International Society of Nephrology (ISN). Dietary recommendation of low-sodium intake and increase of fruits and vegetable together with low-cost anti-hypertensive, anti-diabetic or renoprotective drugs as deemed appropriate, have been able to control proteinuria and slow renal function decline in more than a third of 3,400 individuals on active monitoring.

Regarding the very low protein diet with essential keto acids and amino acids regimen, there is recent and reassuring evidence for its efficacy and nutritionally safety but efforts are needed to improve compliance with dietary regimens. Nutritional educational programs and dieticians could help to increase patient adherence to dietary recommendations. We also recommend that components of the diet and regular monitoring of nutritional status should be jointly assessed by physicians and dieticians, just as recommended for patients with inherited metabolic defects, cirrhosis and diabetes.

### Let them eat healthy: can emerging potassium binders help overcome dietary potassium restrictions in chronic kidney disease? [^111ssZh1]. Journal of Renal Nutrition (2020). Medium credibility.

Potassium-rich foods might provide many health benefits even to people who have declining renal function. The barrier to obtaining these health benefits has long been the concern over hyperkalemia. There are new and novel treatment options available which may enable patients with chronic kidney disease to obtain the health benefits of eating a diet that contains foods such as fruits and vegetables which are high in potassium while reducing the risk of hyperkalemia. We conclude by emphasizing the need for clinical trials with patients on hemodialysis to directly compare the current standard of care, including a potassium-restricted diet, to a potassium-liberalized diet with a potassium binder. The outcome measures would be serum potassium (< 5.3 mmol/L), assessments of acidosis, blood pressure, constipation, glycemic control, overhydration, and azotemia, all of which might change in a favorable direction with vegetarian diets as well as quality of life and satisfaction.

### Joint association of urinary sodium and potassium excretion with cardiovascular events and mortality: prospective cohort study [^115bYdW9]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Public health implications

Guidelines for dietary recommendations, targeting the entire population, should be both feasible and based on clear high quality evidence of improved health outcomes. Our results suggest that a combined strategy of low sodium intake (< 2.0 g/day), while simultaneously increasing potassium intake to > 3.5 g/day, is unrealistic, as only 0.002% of the population were in this range (0.2% for potassium excretion of 2.62 g/day, if we assume that about 75% of potassium is excreted in urine). These estimates are consistent with reports from studies in the United Kingdom (0.1%), United States (0.3%), Mexico (0.15%), and France (0.5%). In each of these studies, estimates of sodium intake were based on questionnaire, which is known to underestimate intake, meaning that the proportion of the population achieving actual target may be lower than reported. This finding also meant that we were unable to evaluate the association of these joint dietary intake levels with health outcomes, as numbers of participants were insufficient despite the large sample size. We observed a linear relation between increased sodium and potassium intake, a consistent finding of other studies. These findings question the feasibility of increasing potassium intake while achieving very low sodium intake of populations through modifying diets. While small phase II clinical trials, such as DASH-Sodium, have achieved these targets in the short term, they required complete control of dietary intake, which is impractical in free living populations. In contrast, the PREDIMED study, which promoted increased intake of potassium containing foods (fruit, vegetables, nuts) with greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, without focusing on low sodium intake, reported a statistically significant reduction in cardiovascular disease and mortality, and adherence to a Mediterranean diet has an inconsistent correlation with sodium intake. In addition, a recent analysis of the NHANES study reported that sodium intake > 2.3 g/day was associated with better diet quality, compared with diets of less than 2.3 g/day, meaning that improving dietary quality is likely to be easier to achieve within a moderate sodium intake range. These considerations raise considerable doubts about the feasibility and assumed cardiovascular effects of current recommendations to reduce sodium intake to very low levels (< 2 g/day), which may counteract achieving other dietary targets and improving overall dietary quality.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Table 12 — Lifestyle and stress-reduction interventions to lower blood pressure — weight loss, heart-healthy diet (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension [DASH]), sodium reduction/salt substitute, potassium intake, and alcohol reduction list evidence-based goals and the Approximate Mean Change in systolic blood pressure (SBP) in mm Hg with and without hypertension. For weight loss (body weight or body mass index [BMI]), goals are "Aim for sustained ≥ 5% reduction in body weight or ≥ 3 kg/m2 reduction in BMI; expect about 1 mm Hg reduction for every 1-kg reduction in body weight", with hypertension −6 to −8 and without hypertension −3 to −5. For a heart-healthy diet (DASH), the goal is to "Consume a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and low-fat dairy products, with reduced content of saturated and total fat", with hypertension −5 to −8 and without hypertension −3 to −7. For reduced sodium intake, the target is "Optimal goal is < 2300 mg/d, but aim for an ideal limit of < 1500 mg/d", with hypertension −6 to −8 and without hypertension −1 to −4; using a salt substitute to "Replace cooking/table salt (100% sodium chloride) with salt substitute (25%–30% potassium chloride, 65%–75% sodium chloride, and 0%–10% flavoring agents)" to "Reduce dietary sodium intake as above" yields with hypertension −5 to −7 and without hypertension −5. For enhanced potassium intake, the goal is "Aim for 3500–5000 mg/d, ideally by consumption of a diet rich in potassium; or alternative use of moderate-dose pharmacological potassium supplementation (< 80 mmol)", with hypertension −6 and without hypertension −3 to −6. For reduced alcohol intake, the goal is "Optimal goal is abstinence for all adults for best health outcomes; in patients who consume alcohol, aim for > 50% reduction in daily intake to no more than 2 drinks/d in men or 1 drink/d in women", with hypertension −4 to −6 and without hypertension −3.

### Adjunct role of potassium-rich vegetarian diet and a novel potassium food supplement to improve pain in chronic rheumatoid arthritis on supervised standard care: a randomised controlled study [^111tQ5be]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a lifelong autoimmune disease characterised by painful polyarthritis and articular deformities, and systemic complications. Patients often suffer from poor quality of life and productivity and reduced longevity. The global burden is enormous and rheumatology care is often inadequate. Standard treatment guidelines focus on drugs and adjuvant therapies such as diet are neglected. In ancient medicinal systems, diet is pivotal in the management of arthritis. An evidence-based therapeutic role of diet in RA seems limited.

We reported low potassium intake in RA. Although an essential micronutrient, its role in RA is not described. Weberadvocated a strong aetiological link. A population nutrition survey showed low potassium intake and serum potassium in RA subjects. A low body potassium in RA was reported. High potassium chloride (mixed in grape juice) intake for 28 days reduced pain and improved RA.

The current objective was to investigate oral potassium as an adjunct to standard RA treatment. The primary hypothesis was potassium-reduced joint pain in RA. Potassium-rich vegetarian diet and a novel potassium-enriched food supplement were used as active intervention.

### Effects of potassium or sodium supplementation on mineral homeostasis: a controlled dietary intervention study [^112ykatP]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Subjects and Methods

Study design

We analyzed a double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover study that assessed the effects of both potassium and sodium supplementation on blood pressure and vascular function in untreated prehypertensive individuals (i.e. individuals with a morning office systolic blood pressure [SBP] between 130 and 159 mm Hg after an overnight fasting) who did not use antihypertensive medication. The study protocol has been extensively described before. In brief, the participants were provided with a controlled diet, which contained on average 2.4 g (104 mmol) of sodium, based on the recommended maximum sodium intake of 2.0 to 2.4 g per day (which equals 87–104 mmol sodium or 5–6 g salt per day), and 2.3 g (59 mmol) of potassium per day for a 2500-kcal intake. The research facility supplied 90% of the daily energy needs, the remaining 10% were chosen by the participants from a list of products that were low in sodium and potassium. The average composition of the diet was calculated for which nutrient values were obtained from the Dutch food composition table, these values were described in a previously published work. For this study, we calculated the average phosphorus intake of the diet which was 2004 mg/d and standardized to 2500 kcal this would be 1806 mg/d. After a run-in period of 1 week on the controlled diet ("baseline"), individuals were randomized to take 8 sodium chloride capsules (i.e. 3.0 g = 130 mmol sodium), 8 potassium chloride capsules (i.e. 2.8 g = 72 mmol potassium), or 8 placebo capsules (cellulose) daily, for 4 weeks each. Individuals were weighed twice a week and, if needed, their energy intake was adjusted to keep body weight constant.

Summary — guidance for kidney care professionals emphasizes that potassium and phosphorus additive considerations are timely given the rapid expansion of processed foods and recommendations to use potassium-enriched salt substitutes to reduce sodium intake; potassium additives may be beneficial in patients at low risk for hyperkalemia, and when restriction of potassium-based additives is needed, interventions could range from basic to advanced depending on the level of hyperkalemia risk; phosphorus additives entail nonhealth benefits, and limiting their intake is recommended in all patients with CKD using a similar tiered approach.

### Global guidelines recommendations for dietary sodium and potassium intake [^112q31aN]. Hypertension Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) cause a significant global health challenge, with unhealthy diets identified as a major risk factor. Sodium and potassium, which are essential minerals for human health, play important roles in various bodily functions, and an imbalance in their intake can have significant health implications, particularly concerning hypertension and cardiovascular diseases. This review compiles dietary sodium and potassium intake recommendations from prominent global health organizations and compares global guidelines to Japan's Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) guidelines. Sodium and potassium intake guidelines from organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO), American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA), Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA), European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), and DRI for Japanese exhibit variations. Compared to other Asian countries, Japan's historically higher sodium goal aligns with Southeast Asia where traditional preserved foods contribute to high sodium intake. Contrarily, Japan's lower potassium goal contrasts with other countries in Asia promoting a diet rich in fruits and vegetables. The ongoing effort by Japan to align with global recommendations reflects a gradation approach considering social habits. While harmonizing international efforts is essential, appreciating regional diversities is paramount through tailoring guidelines to cultural and dietary habit practices. Implementing context-specific guidelines informed by scientific research can contribute to global efforts in promoting healthy diets and reducing the burden of NCDs. Global guidelines that recommended the daily dietary intake goal for sodium and potassium exhibit variations. These disparities are influenced by diverse factors, including cultural dietary habits, socioeconomic status, health priorities, and available scientific research. Each population should follow the recommendations of their region.

### Hyperkalemia and plant-based diets in chronic kidney disease [^113aJNEW]. Advances in Kidney Disease and Health (2023). Medium credibility.

Traditional dietary guidelines for patients with kidney disease recommend restriction of plant foods due to concerns about hyperkalemia and associated adverse events. Studies conducted over several decades have shown that the basis for these guidelines does not match the evidence. Serum potassium levels can be elevated in patients with reduced kidney function after consumption of foods with potassium-based additives or with highly concentrated potassium content such as juices, dried fruit, or purees. However, plant foods may have certain qualities that may blunt potassium retention including their alkalinizing effects, the lack of bioavailable potassium, and the impact of dietary fiber in organic plant foods on colonic potassium excretion. Furthermore, there are many benefits of plant foods that patients with kidney disease may be missing by excluding them from their diets by recommending the historical low-potassium "renal diet". Revised dietary recommendations for kidney health may encourage patient-centered kidney recipes that revolve around plant foods and do not restrict them.

Hyperkalemia contributors and diet strategies in chronic kidney disease (CKD) — non-dietary factors and when diet restriction applies are outlined. Medications, metabolic acidosis, hyperosmosis due to hyperglycemia, hypernatremia or uremia, and constipation are more likely to explain plasma potassium abnormalities than diet. Although short-term dietary restriction of the foods highest in potassium is a valid strategy to treat acute hyperkalemia, restriction of foods highest in bioavailable potassium may be a supportive prevention strategy for people with a history of hyperkalemia or during periods in which hyperkalemia risk is a concern.

Food insecurity — defined as the lack of reliable access to affordable and nutritious food — also plays a critical role; individuals uncertain about where their next meal will come from may prioritize foods that are energy-dense, filling, and shelf-stable over more nutritious options such as fruits and vegetables, which are lower in calories and spoil more quickly, and these behaviors often have long-term consequences as children in lower socioeconomic circumstances tend to adopt the purchasing and eating habits of the adults around them.

### New insights into dietary approaches to potassium management in chronic kidney disease [^114R9ee4]. Journal of Renal Nutrition (2023). Medium credibility.

Potassium disorders are one of the most common electrolyte abnormalities in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), contributing to poor clinical outcomes. Maintaining serum potassium levels within the physiologically normal range is critically important in these patients. Dietary potassium restriction has long been considered a core strategy for the management of chronic hyperkalemia in patients with CKD. However, this has been challenged by recent evidence suggesting a paradigm shift toward fostering more liberalized, plant-based dietary patterns. The advent of novel potassium binders and an improved understanding of gastrointestinal processes involved in potassium homeostasis (e.g., gastrointestinal potassium wasting) may facilitate a paradigm shift and incorporation of heart-healthy potassium-enriched food sources. Nevertheless, uncertainty regarding the risk-benefit of plant-based diets in the context of potassium management in CKD remains, requiring well-designed clinical trials to determine the efficacy of dietary potassium manipulation toward improvement of clinical outcomes in patients with CKD.

### Estimated potassium intake and the progression of chronic kidney disease [^1169DZvg]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

We provide evidence of an association between a lower estimated potassium intake and a higher risk of CKD progression. Our results suggest that a lower potassium intake reduces some nutritional benefits in certain patients with CKD. Therefore, we suggest caution against implementing potassium intake restrictions that do not consider the individual background of the patient, including the nutritional status, and adequate potassium intake should be recommended, taking care not to cause serious adverse events.

Potassium intake and supplementation — Higher dietary intake of potassium-rich foods and a lower urinary sodium to potassium ratio are associated with lower BP and lower stroke and mortality rates; trials show moderate potassium supplementation lowers BP by 6/4 mm Hg on average, with greater effects among participants with hypertension and those with higher urinary sodium excretion at baseline, especially ≥ 4000 mg/day, and a U-shaped response with maximal lowering at approximately 30 mmol/day and increases above 80 mmol/day, with the BP increase at > 80 mmol/day most evident in those taking antihypertensive therapy.

### Increasing potassium intake to prevent kidney damage: a new population strategy? [^112D8Twx]. Kidney International (2020). Medium credibility.

Reducing dietary sodium consumption and increasing potassium intake are effective approaches in reducing the prevalence of cardiovascular diseases. Whether this is also true for chronic kidney disease (CKD) is still debated. Elfassy et al. have examined associations between urinary sodium and potassium excretion and the incidence of CKD in young, 30-year-old subjects followed for 20 years. Although they failed to find an association between sodium intake and CKD incidence, there was an inverse association between high potassium intake and the development of albuminuria.

### Potassium intake and blood pressure: a dose-response meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114u8tnJ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

The public health implications of our findings of a U‐shaped relationship between potassium excretion and BP levels appears to be considerably more important for a potassium intake that is too "low" rather than too "high", also recognizing that the situation is different in clinical practice, where risk associated with hyperkaliemia has a different pattern 11, 24 and therapy. 83 In fact, potassium intake even in "acculturated" populations with an adequate diet tends to be lower, and sometimes much lower, than the adequate intake identified and recommended by risk assessment agencies, public health authorities, and professional societies. 13, 20, 84 Therefore, dietary advice to increase potassium intake is likely to have beneficial effects and result in decreased BP levels in most populations. On the other hand, some populations and some selected subgroups and particularly some individuals (namely, those with hypertension treated with antihypertensive medication), if having a high baseline potassium intake, should be advised not to exceed the potassium intake levels found to be optimal in this meta‐analysis. This may also be true for individuals with low‐to‐intermediate sodium intake, because our analysis also suggests that those with a high sodium intake, as is typical in Western populations, 85, 86, 87 benefit disproportionately from potassium supplementation and may also be more resistant to the BP increase following administration of a high potassium intake, suggesting an interaction between the 2 minerals. In addition, the number of studies was not enough to allow us to perform more detailed stratified subgroup analyses based on presence or absence of hypertension status and category of sodium intake, thus preventing us from verifying the presence of a possible interaction between hypertension status and sodium intake. Our BP estimates for the BP effect of a high potassium intake had wide CIs, making them less certain than BP effects at lower intakes of potassium, because of the small number of studies with relevant information at higher intakes of potassium and the resulting statistical imprecision of the effect estimate. In addition, the results based on achieved potassium excretion yielded little evidence of an increase in BP following a high potassium intake, further calling for caution about the effects of high intake of potassium on BP.

### Potassium chloride-based replacers: modeling effects on sodium and potassium intakes of the US population with cross-sectional data from NHANES 2015–2016 and 2009–2010 [^1158TjLS]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2021). Medium credibility.

Sources of added sodium within the 18 Target Categories

The 18 Target Categories accounting for the highest contributions to sodium intake as shown in Figure 2 formed the basis for modeling F&P replacement of added NaCl with KCl. The original study protocol specified identification of the top 10–15 food categories for use in the modeling. Given the relatively small contributions from each FDA-VSRC, the number of total categories included in the modeling was increased to 20 to capture a larger proportion of sodium intake in the models.

Each of the FDA-VSRC corresponds to a collection of USDA food codes, potentially including single component foods containing high concentrations of sodium (e.g. cheese, processed meats, condiments), food mixtures typically commercially prepared from key dietary sources of sodium (e.g. pizza or a fast-food taco), and food mixtures made from multiple ingredients, potentially including table salt added during preparation. For this analysis, each USDA food code mapped to 1 of the 18 Target Categories of interest was disaggregated into the component Standard Reference (SR) items used by the USDA to process nutrient values for each survey. The SR items used to process nutrient data for the relevant 18 Target Category USDA food codes in each survey were, in turn, reviewed and categorized into 3 categories according to their source of sodium: 1) no added NaCl, 2) low/reduced sodium, or 3) added NaCl, including salt added in typical preparation. Sources of sodium with no added NaCl include foods assumed to contain only intrinsic sodium, i.e. the naturally occurring sodium in foods such as milk, fruits, vegetables, meat, and eggs, and sodium from additives other than NaCl such as sodium bicarbonate (i.e. baking soda).

### Loop diuretics are K-sparing in the presence of a low-Na, high-kdiet [^114MEnyH]. Kidney International (2017). Low credibility.

Under most conditions, loop diuretics are K + -wasting, requiring potassium supplementation. In this issue, Wang and colleagues demonstrate that in mice fed a low-Na +, high-K + diet, loop diuretics, in contrast, are K + -sparing. This observation suggests that possible elevations in plasma K + should be monitored when using a loop diuretic with a low-Na +, high-K + diet, particularly when in combination with a potassium supplement.

### Potassium homeostasis and management of dyskalemia in kidney diseases: conclusions from a kidney disease: improving global outcomes (KDIGO) controversies conference [^112kmFAC]. Kidney International (2020). Medium credibility.

Potassium disorders are common in patients with kidney disease, particularly in patients with tubular disorders and low glomerular filtration rate. A multidisciplinary group of researchers and clinicians met in October 2018 to identify evidence and address controversies in potassium management. The issues discussed encompassed our latest understanding of the regulation of tubular potassium excretion in health and disease; the relationship of potassium intake to cardiovascular and kidney outcomes, with increasing evidence showing beneficial associations with plant-based diet and data to suggest a paradigm shift from the idea of dietary restriction toward fostering patterns of eating that are associated with better outcomes; the paucity of data on the effect of dietary modification in restoring abnormal serum potassium to the normal range; a novel diagnostic algorithm for hypokalemia that takes into account the ascendency of the clinical context in determining cause, aligning the educational strategy with a practical approach to diagnosis; and therapeutic approaches in managing hyperkalemia when chronic and in the emergency or hospital ward. In sum, we provide here our conference deliberations on potassium homeostasis in health and disease, guidance for evaluation and management of dyskalemias in the context of kidney diseases, and research priorities in each of the above areas.

### Handouts for low-potassium diets disproportionately restrict fruits and vegetables [^117FUpoe]. Journal of Renal Nutrition (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Several recent publications, including an expert summary on hyperkalemia management, have encouraged plant-based foods for patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and highlighted the impact of potassium additives on total potassium intake. The aim of this research brief was to investigate if and/or how current recommendations for low-potassium diet may incorporate these new recommendations.

Design and Methods

Using a geographical approach, each province's and territory's government health and renal program (where applicable) website was reviewed for resources on dietary potassium restriction. All handouts/booklets/printable webpages were obtained and reviewed.

Results

Eighteen resources from 6 provincial health agencies in Canada were included. Six additional resources from national agencies were also included, 4 from Canada and 2 from the United States. The 5 most commonly restricted foods were bananas, potatoes, oranges, cantaloupe, and avocados. All resources recommended restriction of fruits and vegetables, 67% recommended restriction of dairy products, 57% recommended restriction of whole grain products, 62% recommended restrictions of plant-based proteins, and 67% mentioned restriction of other foods (such as coffee, tea, and chocolate), 28% mentioned restriction of potassium additives in ultraprocessed foods.

Conclusion

Low-potassium diets primarily restrict fruits and vegetables while the least common restriction is ultraprocessed food. Several recent publics have recommended a greater focus on ultraprocessed versus unprocessed food for hyperkalemia management. These new recommendations differ from current teaching materials that predominately restrict plant-based foods to manage hyperkalemia in CKD. Updates will likely be needed to current resources to reflect new recommendations.

### The role of dietary salt in metabolism and energy balance: insights beyond cardiovascular disease [^111uYc95]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Dietary salt (NaCl) provides the body with sodium, which is essential for cellular homeostasis and a variety of physiological functions. Sodium plays a pivotal role in maintaining extracellular fluid volume and osmolality, as well as in transmembrane transport, particularly by mediating membrane and action potentials via sodium/potassium exchange. It is well established that the quantity of salt required to maintain normal physiological homeostasis in adult humans is < 1.25 g/d. However, in modern diets, daily salt intake far exceeds this amount. For example, epidemiological studies demonstrate that the average daily sodium consumption of most people in the United States is > 3.2 g (equivalent to > 8 g salt, sodium × 2.5 = salt). The general average intake of salt reached 10.06 g/d, and in some populations it has reached approximately 15 to 25 g/d. Ample evidence has shown that long‐term over‐consumption of salt is harmful to health, contributing to the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD), particularly hypertension. As such, health organizations around the world have established dietary guidelines for daily salt intake. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020‐2025 recommend that daily sodium intake in healthy adults should not exceed 2.3 g (5.75 g salt). The World Health Organization (WHO) aims to lower daily dietary salt intake to < 5 g/d. In addition to avoiding excess consumption, low‐salt diets have been encouraged for patients with CVD, particularly heart failure (HF). However, given that sodium ions are an essential noncaloric nutrient, there has been some controversy in the field concerning how large the reduction in salt intake should be. In light of the potential shortcomings of sodium restriction, salt replacement therapy has been proposed as an alternative treatment strategy; this has been tested in the population, with encouraging results.

### Using genetics to inform interventions related to sodium and potassium in hypertension [^117CWUj6]. Circulation (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Hypertension affects ≈1.3 billion adults > 30 years of age worldwide. Risk for hypertension has a strong genetic component; modifiable components of risk include diet, particularly excess intake of sodium and inadequate intake of potassium-rich foods such as fruits and vegetables. Sodium (Na +) intake increases blood pressure (BP) through a number of mechanisms, such as increasing plasma renin activity and angiotensin II, as well as stimulating the sympathetic nervous system. Potassium intake lowers BP by stimulating vasodilation through endothelial cell hyperpolarization, along with renal mechanisms related to electrolyte homeostasis in distal segments of the nephron. – There is a large body of evidence showing that adjusting an individual's ratio of sodium to potassium intake can influence BP, – with specific recommendations that the ideal ratio of sodium to potassium is 1:1 or lower. Higher sodium-to-potassium ratios are also associated with poorer diet quality that aligns more with a Western, or unhealthier, dietary pattern. However, potassium intake may not be purely antihypertensive, with evidence that excessive intake can increase BP.

### Effects of sodium and potassium | Salt… [^114Jqf5j]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Sodium and potassium are electrolytes that help your body maintain fluid and blood volume.
- Consuming too much sodium and too little potassium can raise your blood pressure.
- High blood pressure increases your risk of heart disease and stroke. Why it's important Sodium and potassium are electrolytes needed for your body to function properly, including hydration, blood volume, and the functioning of your nerves and muscles. We get electrolytes from our food and drinks. Consuming too much sodium can raise your blood pressure. Limiting sodium intake is especially important if you have high blood pressure, also known as hypertension. Increasing potassium intake can help decrease your blood pressure if you have high blood pressure. By lowering blood pressure, increasing potassium intake can also reduce your risk for heart disease and stroke. Terms to know Though the words "salt" and "sodium" are often used interchangeably, they do not mean the same thing.

Salt is also known by its chemical name, sodium chloride. Salt is a crystal-like compound that is common in nature. Sodium is a mineral, and it is a chemical element found in salt. Food sources of sodium and potassium Most Americans eat too much sodium and too little potassium. Americans consume more than 3, 400 milligrams of sodium each day, on average. This is well above the federal recommendation of less than 2, 300 mg of sodium daily for teens and adults as part of a healthy eating pattern. Most sodium in our diets comes from packaged and restaurant food. Foods with moderate amounts of sodium, such as bread, can be major sources of sodium because they're eaten so frequently. Most potassium we eat naturally occurs in vegetables, fruit, seafood, and dairy products. Some good sources of potassium include bananas, oranges, melons, potatoes, sweet potatoes, and cooked spinach and broccoli.

What you can do See tips for reducing sodium intake at the grocery store, at home, and in restaurants. Consider adopting the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension eating plan. It is low in sodium, cholesterol, and saturated and total fats, and high in fruits and vegetables, fiber, potassium, and low-fat dairy products.

### Blood pressure lowering and potassium intake [^116NvQip]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

Potassium (K +) is an extremely important mineral, as supported by National Academy of Science, Engineering, and Medicine Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI), and has been designated as a "nutrient of public health concern" due to its general under consumption. In 2004, the Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine established recommended intake levels of 4700 mg/day of K +. Despite these recommendations, data from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2007–2008 estimated mean intakes in the United States to be 2290 mg/day for women and 3026 mg/day for men, substantially lower than the suggested values. This relative "deficiency" is even more noteworthy when one considers the K + intake of prehistoric man was estimated to be 15,000 mg/day, which actually exceeds the NHANES recommendations by a factor greater than 4. Despite studies demonstrating blood pressure lowering effects of increasing K + intake, the 2019 DRI concluded more evidence is required to support a DRI for K +.

The daily intake of Na + in Western industrialized societies is about three times higher than the daily intake of K + on a molar basis. Urinary excretion of K + and Na + are the most accurate measure of dietary consumption. Data suggest the urinary Na + /K + ratio has a stronger association with blood pressure than Na + or K + independently. A urinary Na + /K + ratio < 1 has been recommended as a beneficial target to improve long term blood pressure control. There are two ways of achieving this - either through dietary restriction of Na + and/or through significant increases in dietary K +. While Chaudhary et al. conclude a urinary K + excretion > 1 g/day and a reduction in the urinary Na + /K + ratio are not associated with lower SBP, the observation that SBP is increased when intake is < 1 g K + /day suggests low dietary intake of K + is associated with HIGHER blood pressure and supports the argument for increased dietary K + intake. The findings of this study should be interpreted in the context of numerous other studies demonstrating increased K + intake given as a supplement or achieved by a diet enriched in fruits and vegetable lowers BP in hypertensive and normotensive individuals.

Additional priorities are to determine the value of uric acid–lowering therapies on CKD and CVD outcomes, define dietary modifications that reduce serum uric acid and gout risk, and clarify the safety and efficacy of symptomatic treatments for acute gout (including a short course of NSAIDs). Cardiovascular prevention needs include evaluating the clinical and cost-effectiveness of PCSK-9 inhibitors versus statins, testing antiplatelet agents such as low-dose aspirin for primary prevention in large RCTs, developing CKD-specific risk and bleeding assessment tools, identifying which patients benefit from invasive management of ischemic heart disease versus maximal medical therapy, and creating new thromboprophylaxis risk scores incorporating CKD-specific predictors.

### Potassium-enriched salt for patients with hypertension: a hypertension Australia and national hypertension taskforce of Australia position statement [^116GUf3x]. Journal of Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

High blood pressure remains the leading risk factor for cardiovascular and all-cause deaths in Australia. Higher sodium and lower potassium intake are well established risk factors for elevated blood pressure and increased cardiovascular disease risk. Despite decades of global public health efforts, progress in reducing sodium and increasing potassium intake has been limited. The WHO recommends potassium-enriched salt as an effective, affordable, and scalable strategy to lower blood pressure by simultaneously reducing sodium and increasing potassium intake. This position statement was developed to support implementation and address this public health priority.

Main Recommendations

For patients with hypertension, core dietary recommendations should include reducing sodium by limiting the regular salt added when cooking and at the table, choosing low-salt foods and increasing potassium intake through fruit and vegetable intake. When these changes are challenging, switching regular salt with potassium-enriched salt offers a practical alternative. We recommend including this switch as an additional dietary recommendation in clinical hypertension guidelines. Suggested wording: 'If patients add salt to their food, they should make a 1:1 switch from regular salt to potassium-enriched salt with a composition of approximately 75% sodium chloride and 25% potassium chloride, unless they are at risk of hyperkalaemia because of kidney disease, use of a potassium supplement, use of a potassium sparing diuretic or for another reason". Routine kidney health checks are recommended to support safe implementation.

Changes In Management

We advocate for the inclusion of this recommendation in future hypertension management guidelines. Systematic, nation-wide implementation of potassium-enriched salt as a replacement for regular salt should be prioritized as a scalable public health intervention. We call for further research into the impact of potassium-enriched salt in patients with kidney disease, the general population unscreened for hyperkalaemia risk, and patients using different antihypertensive regimens.

### Should we eat more potassium to better control blood pressure in hypertension? [^114iLNDX]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2019). Medium credibility.

Changes in lifestyle and nutrition are recommended as the first-step approach to the management of hypertension by all national and international guidelines. Today, when considering nutritional factors in hypertension, almost all the attention is focused on the reduction of salt intake to improve blood pressure (BP) control. Changes in potassium intake are only briefly evoked in guidelines. Few physicians actually think about proposing to eat more foods that are high in potassium (fruits, vegetables, nuts) to better control BP. Yet, during the last 40years, increasing evidence has accumulated demonstrating that increasing potassium intake, either with food products or with supplements, is associated with significant reductions of both systolic and diastolic BP. The hypotensive effect of potassium is particularly marked in patients with hypertension and in subjects with a very high sodium intake, suggesting that potassium counterbalances the effects of sodium. In addition, several meta-analyses have now confirmed that high potassium intake reduces the risk of stroke by ∼ 25%. Finally, increasing potassium in the diet may perhaps be beneficial for some renal patients, as post hoc analyses have suggested that a high potassium intake may retard the decline of renal function in patients with early chronic kidney disease (CKD) stages. However, high potassium intake may be risky and sometimes even dangerous in hypertensive patients with CKD stages 3–5, specifically diabetics. In this context, however, as the level of evidence remains low, more prospective clinical studies are needed. The goal of this review is to discuss the actual evidence that supports the recommendation to eat more potassium in order to better control BP in essential hypertension and to review the restrictions in CKD patients with hypertension.

Sodium reduction has been identified as a potentially highly cost-effective means for preventing hypertension and cardiovascular diseases around the world. – It is listed as a best-buy intervention by the WHO, which has developed the SHAKE (Surveillance, Harness industry, Adopt standards for labelling and marketing, Knowledge, Environment) package to support national sodium reduction efforts. Multiple countries have commenced implementation of sodium reduction campaigns that include various strategies, for example, consumer education, food voluntary and mandatory reformulation, taxation, and food labeling. Average global sodium consumption has not, however, fallen over the past decade, and the projected decline over coming years is small — global sodium intake is expected to be 4.23 (10.6-g/day salt) g/day in 2025 and 4.16 (10.4-g/day salt) g/day in 2030 (Figure).

On the contrary, average potassium intake falls significantly below the WHO-recommended intake of 3.5 g/day, as indicated by various studies — ≈1.0 g/day in India,1.4 g/day in China, and 1.8 g/day in West Africa. The reasons for low potassium intake vary but are mainly due to limited agricultural capacity for cultivating crops with high potassium contentand, in particular, limited consumption of potassium-rich fruits and vegetables. The direct emphasis on increasing dietary potassium intake often lacks guideline recommendations, despite a focus on promoting the consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables (although many are not rich in potassium). These efforts have largely proven to be ineffective, with many people finding difficulty in adhering to recommendations, in both higher and lower resource settings. Due to the importance of both sodium and potassium intake, the WHO recommends an intake of < 2000 mg of sodium and > 3510 mg of potassium daily, resulting in a sodium-to-potassium ratio of ≤ 1.

### KDOQI US commentary on the KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of CKD [^114sTgDs]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Hyperkalemia in CKD — practice points emphasize awareness of variability in potassium measurement and local formulary constraints, note no recommendations for timing to recheck potassium or for managing hyperkalemia, and provide dietary guidance. In CKD G3–G5 with emergent hyperkalemia, implement an individualized approach including dietary and pharmacologic interventions with assessment and education through a renal dietitian or an accredited nutrition provider. Provide advice to limit the intake of foods rich in bioavailable potassium (e.g., processed foods) for people with CKD G3–G5 who experience hyperkalemia or when it is an emerging issue and for individuals with kidney failure receiving dialysis when intakes of potassium are variable, and consider dietary and pharmacologic strategies during disease periods in which hyperkalemia risk may be a concern.

### Twenty-four-hour urinary sodium and potassium excretion in China: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111MuNej]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

The lack of assessment or report on the completeness of the 24‐hour urine was a limitation. No single standard exists for assessing the completeness of a 24‐hour urine collection, and undercollection is common. 80 Our estimates were not adjusted for nonurinary (eg, feces, sweat) losses. Therefore, our figures are underestimates of the true sodium and potassium intakes in China. Other domains with high risks of bias (sample size calculation, sampling frame, calculation of sodium and potassium excretion) reflected reporting rather than study quality and thus did not affect our findings. Finally, the data available did not allow for province‐level comparisons over time; the time trends in our report should be interpreted at the regional level.

Although sodium intake is suggested to have decreased in northern China, the most recent data show that the intake level is still more than double the maximum intake recommended by the World Health Organization; while in southern China, there is a trend of increase. Urgent action is required to accelerate sodium reduction in all regions of China. The Chinese government has made sodium reduction a key component of "Healthy Lifestyle for All", an initiative to prevent non‐communicable diseases. An action group, "Action on Salt China", has taken up the task of harnessing support and participation from all regions across China to develop tailored and sustainable sodium‐reduction interventions. 98 The rapid increase in the consumption of processed and out‐of‐home foods must be addressed before the hard‐won declines in sodium intake are offset. Nevertheless, discretionary salt use still constitutes the vast majority of the sodium consumed in China. Behavior change thus remains primordial, and key periods for the formation of dietary habits are childhood and adolescence. Reducing children's sodium intake leads to a decrease in their blood pressure, which could prevent hypertension and cardiovascular disease later in life. 99, 100 Replacing regular salt with low‐sodium, high‐potassium salt substitutes would achieve the dual objective of reducing sodium intake while simultaneously increasing potassium intake. Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated the role of salt substitutes in reducing blood pressure and cardiovascular disease mortality. 101, 102, 103 Concerns over the risk of hyperkalemia associated with the use of salt substitutes are likely to be unwarranted in the Chinese general population in view of the very low intakes of potassium. Nevertheless, potassium intakes should ideally be increased through foods. Given the sheer size of the Chinese population, achieving sodium reduction together with increasing potassium intake nationwide will result in an enormous benefit for global health.

### Taking the kale out of hyperkalemia: plant foods and serum potassium in patients with kidney disease [^112jsHRJ]. Journal of Renal Nutrition (2022). Medium credibility.

Traditionally, diets for kidney disease were low in potassium. This recommendation was based on outdated research and often wrong assumptions that do not reflect current evidence. In fact, studies conducted over the past decades show patients with CKD, including kidney failure, do not benefit from the restriction of plant foods relative to control. Generally, dietary potassium does not correlate with serum potassium, and we posit that this is due to the effects of fiber on colonic potassium absorption, the alkalinizing effect of fruits and vegetables on metabolic acidosis, and the bioavailability of dietary potassium in plant foods. Also, consumption of plant foods may provide pleiotropic benefits to patients with CKD. Emerging dietary recommendations for kidney health should be devoid of dietary potassium restrictions from plant foods so that patient-centered kidney recipes can be encouraged and promoted.

### Potassium and hypertension: a state-of-the-art review [^113D2kaT]. American Journal of Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Hypertension is the single most important and modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality worldwide. Non pharmacologic interventions, in particular dietary modifications have been established to decrease blood pressure (BP) and hypertension related adverse cardiovascular events. Among those dietary modifications, sodium intake restriction dominates guidelines from professional organizations and has garnered the greatest attention from the mainstream media. Despite guidelines and media exhortations, dietary sodium intake globally has not noticeably changed over recent decades. Meanwhile, increasing dietary potassium intake has remained on the sidelines, despite similar BP-lowering effects. New research reveals a potential mechanism of action, with the elucidation of its effect on natriuresis via the potassium switch effect. Additionally, potassium-substituted salt has been shown to not only reduce BP, but also reduce the risk for stroke and cardiovascular mortality. With these data, we argue that the focus on dietary modification should shift from a sodium-focused to a sodium- and potassium-focused approach with an emphasis on intervention strategies which can easily be implemented into clinical practice.
